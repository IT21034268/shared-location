2,Acura TSX,This is not the right size for a ACURA TSX. It will not fit. It is longer than the OEM wiper. Other than that the wiper quality is good.
4,Great for knitters with some experience,"If you want to learn to knit, this is not the book for you.I gave this book 4 stars because I had heard about it being a great book for learning to knit. I bought it for myself for the Debbie Bliss' patterns and also to check it out first before I gave it to a friend as a first knitting book. I decided that it wasn't thorough enough in the learn-to-knit area so I sent her ""How to Knit"" instead. I always enjoy Debbie Bliss' patterns, she can make something so simple look so wonderful.I have learned some new techniques from this book. I am looking forward to trying out some of the patterns."
2,Smelly Like Your Toes,"Not too much to get excited about here although I am a fan of Elvis's paean to the Beach Boys, 'The Other Side of Summer'. 'Hurry Down Doomsday...' is also a hoot, especially the live version on the Rhino issue bonus disc."
3,good in general but...,"I have kept a 5-year-old SHARP VCR, which I liked very much until my little boy destroyed it. I could not find a SHARP but someone recommended this Toshiba VCR. Since I always liked my old Toshiba notebook computer and this model was on sale, I did not hesitate to buy this unit. This is not bad for the price. But people in Toshiba VCR must more work on the remote control, which does not work for my SHARP TV. The manual says that it could happen, and then I need to use the TV old remote control! Two remotes! Does not sound friendly or convenient..."
3,"NOT Recommended---Vague, Poorly organized, Lacks Clarity","I do not recommend this book. I have quite a lot of watercolor books including several on painting flowers in watercolor, and this one ranks at the bottom.This book lacks a lot of clarity and the instructions are extremely vague for the most part. Some of the demonstrations begin with a picture of a penciled drawing of a flower, then go on to the next picture, which looks like a highly detailed finished painting, with a short paragraph on how the finished product was accomplished. I got the feeling that this book was hastily put together by a number of people working segmentally. There are a few acceptable demonstrations, but for the most part, the book lacks clarity and leaves students on their own to interpret what the author really means. If someone were considering this book, I would have at LEAST 5 other watercolor color flower painting books that I would recommend instead of this one. It was quite a disappointment."
2,Void Missed,"Although somewhat entertaining to read, this story by highly recommended Michael Connelly just misses success. A narrative slow in progression with a weak background story. Nice to see a female lead in a caper. Interesting note- one of the characters in Void Moon is mentioned in Michael Connelly's excellent book ""City of Bones""."
5,Unpredictable,"This book had so many unseen twists and turns! The book moved along at a good clip, and had excellent details. I am in a rush to finsih this up, but this is a hands down suspense SUCCESS. BUY IT!!"
5,Let's hear it for Cassie!,"As a thriller writer (as yet unpublished) I find Cassie to be the most believable female hero I have ever met.Harry is the product of his experience -- Cassie seems to draw her strength from some inner well of resource -- and that is fascinating.I loan this book to my lady friends, and I hope Michael will do another one about Cassie.RZ"
4,Synchronicity,"I had no idea what Void Moon was about when I started reading it (I mistakenly thought it was a Harry Bosch tale (I don't read leaf jackets with proven writers) and I thought initially (the first 100 pages) that Connelly finally wrote a dull one. I was having trouble feeling for the female protagonist who is an ex-con and an un-repented professional thief. Then events picked up and the pages started flying by.Void Moon is one of Connelly's best, Bosch or otherwise. Private Investigator James Karch is one of Connelly's best character creations. When he entered the story mid-book, things really took off.I thought the ending was more satisfying (not completely satisfying) than some of his other books which are the only things that keep me from rating them all 5 stars"
4,Connelly solid as usual,"Connelly is one of the most consistently good writers in the genre. Even his ""bad"" books are as good as many other authors best efforts. And while Void Moon is not up to his best work, it is nonetheless a very good read. The characters are all well written, although I did not particularly care for the character of Jack Karch. There was something missing with him and I found him a little flat. But the plot is very exciting and fast paced, and I finished the book the same day I started it. My main problem was with a few of the events at the end of the book. I don't want to give anything away, but I found some of it a bit contrived. The book is perhaps a little simplistic compared to some of Connelly's other books. Overall though it is very good, and I would recommend it."
1,boring,"I could not even finish this book it was so boring! The main character was very dull and I really didn't care what happened to her. There was no suspense, action, or mystery in this book. Michael Connelly is a wonderful author but, I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote Void Moon. He should stick to cops and murders."
2,"I agree, not one of his best","I've read all of Connelly's books and this one falls short in every area. I found Cassie to be a one-note character, who wasn't particularly likeable. I had hoped that her pursuer would be more than a standard bad guy, in fact, I would rather have seen an offbeat romance betweeen them and team them against the casino head. No such luck. And sadly, the final reveal of who did what to who, doesn't make sense. Sorry, I take a pass on this one. I just hope they don't try to make it into a movie!"
2,Disappointing,"A very average book from a great author. This was the only Connelly book I have ever been disappointed with. A simple story which moves forward chronologically with the mandatory plot twist at the end. The book was either written for him, written rather quickly. or written to fulfill a book contract requirement. Try any one of the other Connelly books and enjoy."
4,The best of his non-Bosch novels,"Maybe it's because Harry Bosch was Connelly's first creation that his writing always seems to rise to a higher level when he's focusing on Bosch. Maybe it's because I read his Bosch novels first. Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I still can't help waiting for the next Bosch installment. This is a great book and if it were anyone else's novel, I'd probably give it 5 stars. Cassie Black is a strong character and I liked her and sympathized with her. It just doesn't matter to me if I don't see her in a sequel."
4,"Good, standard Connelly work","I, like some of the previous reviewers, am a big fan of the Harry Bosch books. I have also read Michael Connelly's non Bosch books. While I have not liked any of them as much as ""Harry"", they have all been enjoyable reads. ""Void Moon"" is no different. I was quickly engrossed in the storyline and the book never bogged down. I think that Connelly keeps the ""Harry Bosch"" character fresh by doing other works. In my opinion Michael Connelly is the best crime/mystery author writing now and you won't be disappointed with ""Void Moon""."
4,Void Moon,"An interesting departure from Harry Bosch- full of suspense. While you might wish to stop at the end of a chapter, it does not allow you that privilege- unless that is you have good will power to wait for the verdict.Once again well written by Michael Connelly."
5,Connelly Succeeds With Female Protagonist,"One thing people haven't commented on yet is Connelly's nice handling of a story that centers on a female lead character. It can't be an easy thing to do when you've always written from a strong male point of view, but Connelly pulls it off. Cassie Black is very believable. While he doesn't go as far as female authors like Sue Grafton and Sara Paretsky in capturing a woman's thoughts and actions, for a man he pulled it off pretty darn well. Another point to make is that this is a ""caper"" book -- with a complex, drawn out plan for a burglary -- that harkens back to his first book, THE BLACK ECHO (the first Harry Bosch book) and its great bank robbery caper. By the way, my pick for Connelly's best book ever is THE CONCRETE BLONDE (the 3rd in the Bosch series)."
4,"Literate, exciting, real.....","This was the first Connelly book I read. (on the advice of a friend i trust). Those who know Connelly from his Harry Bosch series won't be a bit surprised at the tense, exciting REAL quality of this novel.Connelly really gets you into the head of his main character, Cassie Black, a reformed thief who is forced into one last job by circumstances beyond her control. Connelly really gets inside the head of this woman, who has some secrets in her past, and wants to begin a new life.The intricate plot also leads to new information about the death of Cassie's lover and mentor. To say much mroe would spoil your enjoyment. Check out this literate thriller by ex-crime reporter Connelly."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"BRING BACK HARRY BOSCH! WE ARE PRESENTED WITH LOW LIFE CHARACTERS NOT WORTH LEARNING ABOUT, DEAD CHARACTERS FROM THE PAST WHO SHAPED THE LIVES OF THE LIVE CHARACTERS WE DON'T CARE ABOUT, AND A WEAK PLOT TO BOOT WITH A ENDING, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET. READ LIKE A DIME NOVEL AND WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR. BRING BACK THE SUCCESS AND STAY WITH THE WINNING FORMULA!"
3,"Entertaining and original, but not quite scary","It's okay as a book, but it isn't scary (as stated before). The books main trouble is that it doesn't have any real villains on it, and the time travel isn't very detailed at all. I only recommend this book if you like Ghosts of Fear Street or because of its main character."
5,COMPLETE QUALITY !!!!!,"Like the Flexi-Leash, these ""saddlebags"" are fantastic!They fit the Flexi-Leash beautifully - and are the samefine quality!!! This is a ""must"" companion product!"
2,great product but poor quality,"I bought this Flexi Leash Accessory Bag-Black on Amazon about 2 months ago. The product worked great initially. The bag is a tad bit too big for the flexi small dog leash, but it still made my life much easier because I could organize my dog food in one pouch and the doggie doo-doo bags in the other. I could tell right away the bag materials and stitching were of low quality. The stitching has already come undone on one of the pouches, so now everything has to go in the other pouch. It is only a matter of time before the stitching rips on the other pouch and renders the bag useless.I am tempted to buy another one, because of the low price on amazon and I know that it will fit my flexi leash that I love... but am I going to have to replace this every 2 months? Seriously, is this product made by flexi, because it lacks the quality of their leashes? Anyone know of a better quality substitute?"
1,junk saw,"I have one of these saws. The shoe will not stay square to the blade. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but the metal piece that the shoe connects is just mount in a slot formed in each side of the shells. This is a bad saw. I've had other saws that I paid less money for that performed better."
2,Below average saw,"I bought this saw because I thought the price was right, and I thought I wouldn't need a high-end saw for the light work I would be doing. First off, the saw vibrates enough to loosen your teeth. For the life of me, I cannot keep this thing cutting in a straight line. The quick-clamp is pretty nice, and so is the scrolling feature for tight turns (unfortunately, you need it for straight line cuts too). The line of sight is not bad, either. Overall, a below average jig-saw.A neighbor of mine has a Bosch Barrel-Grip he swears by, so I'll check one of those out. Pass this one up."
2,Questionable quality,"This teether looks better live, it's well designed and the colors are much brighter than what's shown in the picture. When you twist it, it makes a cool clicking sound. I know my baby would have loved this toy, but the reason I didn't give it to her was that the one I received had what appeared to be dried crusty glue around the seams that would not wash off no matter how hard I scrubbed. I can't possibly give this to my baby to put in her mouth. Too bad. The cost of this item doesn't justify paying postage to return it, so maybe I'll let my daughter play with it when she stops putting everything in her mouth."
1,Horrible toxic smelling toy,"If you value your child's health, don't buy this teether. The noxious fumes it emanates can't be good for anyone, let alone a child who is supposed to be putting it in their mouth! Please stop selling this product amazon, it is that bad! It shouldn't even have one star..."
1,bad plastic smell,We received this one as a gift. Our daughter loved it but I was leery b/c of the bad plastic smell it had. It isn't listed as bpa-free so I decided it wasn't worth keeping and opted for safer options.
3,Not bad,"This is a pretty good book about OBL. Well-researched, etc. But there are other options out there just as good. I recommend 'The Stars Of Abbottabad'. It's fiction, yes, but it gives a pretty unique look inside the Abbottabad compound."
2,Media Perspective,"The events of 11 September has led to a sudden resurgence in books and articles on Islam and the core of world terrorism. HOLY WAR, INC. is good basic background. Unfortunately, it is somewhat typical of the CNN worldview. Broad brushstrokes but never completing the point. An example is the core debate over Islam itself. While Mr. Bergen does us the service of pointing out Professor Huntington's CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS he weakens the point by attempting to point to a few somewhat moderate Islamic spokespersons. This is the problem of journalists attempting to write analytical works. They lack the basic issue of providing an analytical point and then defending it. Instead we get a bit of this and a bit of that. One should read this book but only after other, more vital, works such as BIN LADEN: The Man Who Declared War on America by Yossef Bodansky."
2,Disappointing Compared to PC Version,"I love the PC version of Re-Volt, unfortunitely the Playstation version does not do it justice. Game play is very similair, but the graphics are much poorer and the games takes much longer to load. If you have a PC with a 3dfx card, get the pc version."
3,Read this book as a kind of science fiction.,"The book is artistically written and presents a fascinating dilemma -- if one's mystical experiences are caused by a physical ailment, does that necessarily mean they were invalid, or was the ailment God's way of conveying his messages to you?However, its depiction of life in Carmel is complete fabrication. Carmelite nuns don't behave the way they are depicted in this story. One should read the writings of St. Therese of Avila, the great reformer of the Carmelite order. Her books have been translated very well into English and she writes in a down-to-earth manner that is easy for modern readers to understand."
5,Why are we here?,"A great book brings you this close to another's heart. Mark Salzman has done an informed and sensitive job of exploring what is hidden. Lots of wonderful similes. I could feel her childhood pain. I could understand her mid-life crisis. This book is food for spiritual growth, and maybe, for a second, a chance to walk in the path of a Carmelite nun."
4,An Exploration of Fatih,"Lying Awake, a fast read, seems at first glance to be going nowhere. Then, all of a sudden, you begin thinking about the intangibles of faith. Now, you identify with Sister John. Salzman also makes us think about the superstitions we all have and their influence on our lives. A thought provoking novel."
4,A Contemplative Gem....Without the Arrogance and Alienation,"Its brevity and sparse tone lend themselves perfectly to this wise picture of monastic life. In his depiction of of Sister John's search for true devotion, Salzman uses poetic restraint. He does not demand that his characters experience faith-altering revelations but, instead, invites the reader to enjoy a beautifully subtle journey during which questions are raised about the substance of faith and the reconcilliation of mind, body and spirit.Mark Salzman has certainly shown us the power of his versatility. His previous novels and memoir, sometimes lighthearted and always socially relevant, lead us to this most recent and highly accomplished work."
2,I Became Uncomfortable,"I was really enjoying Lying Awake - the real world of cloistered life, the conflict of the solemn vows and the interluding poetry - until I reached page 139, about three fourths the way through the novel. Here we are told that the Miserere was an ancient poem written in honor of the Blessed Virgin. Lots of us (Catholic or not) know that Miserere, ""have mercy on me"", comes from the 51st Psalm (Vulgate Psalm 50) and has been the foundation of many noteworthy music arrangements throughout history. Fiction or not, I became uncomfortable in not knowing Salzman's further diligence and research."
3,Hate to dissent,"I just read the article in the New Yorker about Salzman's appearances promoting his book where he interlaces his talk by playing the cello. The years of struggle he spent to write this book are evident in the results -- it seems more a writing exercize than a novel. I felt more recital than meaning in the quotations of the nuns sayings from their liturgy and writings. It seemed to me to be an extrusion of what was far simpler. Aren't I a case? I must say I did enjoy reading this all but plotless book, because I, like most of you, wonder what life in the cloister would be like. I am not certain this book is a good example, but how am I to know?"
3,Good Product but works better on MACs than PCs,"I bought this a month ago but had trouble installing it on my Dell PC (running Windows XP.) Before I bought this, I talked to Digidesign Tech Support, and they cannot tell me for sure if the software will run on my PC. The problem seems to be that there are so many different PC's out there (using different Intel processor chips) that Digidesign has not tested ProTools on all of them. Most of my colleagues who use ProTools are using it on MAC's. So I decided to return the product and and wait until I can buy a MAC first.Also, the retailer - Electronica Direct - charged $39 for shipping (by UPS), which I thought was a little steep (I paid only $23 to ship it back by UPS with full insurance.) But they were very reasonable and courteous with processing the return."
5,Best for the Price,"Most miter-saw stands with the features I wanted cost around two hundred dollars and are ideally suited for the professional, which I'm not. I spotted this stand in my local HD (at about half the cost listed here); researched its features and users' reviews of it on the web; bought it. Assembly was straight-forward with clear instructions. In use, the mounting is secure, and the stand stays put with rock-solid sturdiness and effortlessly extends to balance and precisely position very long pieces of lumber. Once the saw is dismounted the stand folds flat.Wolfcraft delivers on every feature of this stand. Great for around the house or workshop; even with the saw mounted, the stand can be wheeled easily across floors. I only wish it had larger (and locking) wheels to give more mobility outside on uneven terrain. But I'm not complaining. I get more than my money's worth every time I use it. There are better stands out there, but not at the much lower price I paid for this one."
3,a bit complicated,"My son (the resident gamer) says this game isn't very fun and the use of the controls to make the game ""work"" is difficult. Not highly recommended."
2,"Creativity? Yeah, right.","The concept of this game is ""Be creative and your park will get money"". That is not the way this game works at all! You can only build up to 6 rollercoasters in each park, and each of the parks terrains are pre-designed! You have to build the rides in designated ride areas! Plus you've got this thing called a ""Thrill Meter"" that limits the size of the rides and amount of them that you can build. In all, this game is great for incredily boring stupid people or for stupid babyish little kids. Now if you're older and creative, rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is the game for you. Buy that for PC rather than this game, It's way better!"
4,i like this game,"My nephew requested this game for Christmas and has been thrilled with it. Lots of different choices and things to do. If you like playing The Sims games, you'll enjoy this game, too!"
5,a careful rendering,"this is a very useful text for graduate and under grad students alike. an english and ancient greek glossary provides the preliminary understanding in vocabulary required to delve into the seemingly simple and plodding nature of this deceptively complex work. Also including is an excellent summary of each book, section by section, as well as an extended commentary located after the main body of the text. a must have for anyone entering the 'wonderful' world of philosophy."
2,Good for People Who Have No Clue what FrontPage is or does,"I bought this book a couple months back. I will keep this short and simple. The manual is Much better. This book lacks any substance, it simply reviews the functions of frontpage without going into detail. Running FrontPage98 (Jim Buyens) is much better for People you Own and Use FrontPage98"
4,Thought Provoking,Found the book to be very thought provoking. I didn't always agree with what was written but in most cases the authors made a good case for their idea. The only negative was that I thought many of the stories were too short and did not give the authors time to expand on their theories.
4,"Not bad, but wish for more...","Some of the earlier chapter's were well written and very intriguing, such as ""What if Jesus Had Lived?"" and ""China's exploration carried further"". However some of it wasn't all to interesting such as ""What if Hitler had lived?"", to sum it up as the book says, it wouldn't matter, bleah! It is still worth it if you liked the first book that they did. However if you're not much of an alternative history nut to begin with, don't bother."
5,DIno CRisis!!!!,"i have always loved dinosaurs and i have always been a fan of resident evil. and when the two come together. your game system will explode, nah just playin. but when i first found this game i was so excited. its a pretty confusing game i think but if you like a challenge and you like some blood and gore then check this out. great story also. scared me when the t rex first attacked me lol. i screamed."
4,Basically Resident Evil with dinos,"This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by Capcom's own Resident Evil series. Basically its the same story you're trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs you'll run accross while playing this game. ALong the way you'll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island. So basically if you enjoyed Resident Evil or any of its clones, Dino Crisis is a game for you."
3,a half baked silent hill with lizards,"sometimes feeding my iguana is more exciting than this game at times. coming off a silent hill high, this game was a dissappointment. very well thought out but a little too cerebral and not enough physical. the ending had me asking ""is that it?"" the option to play again for a different ending did not require a re-rent."
1,Overall I found this game slow and unproductive,"The use of the memory card feature in DINO CRISIS was found to be unreliable. Although the advanced AI is worth a look, more improvements on the things that count..like being able to confidently save your game is needed. The game will also lock up in unpredictable locations throughout the game. Capcom USA(c) went too far in advancement. Sony Playstation just could not keep up with the everchanging flow and mix in the FMV's. In the future maybe the makers of this game should take time making sure all features work before this game is put to market."
2,Dino Crisis,This was one of the first games i remember playing on the Playstation. So i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated. I never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around. a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup. I still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try. I ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the CD during gameplay.
2,Dino Crisis Review,"If you like to shoot dinos this is Not your game. It looks like a good game, but I like action games and this game is just full of puzzles. You only fight 1-2 dinos about every 15-50 minutes. If you want a game that has Dino shooting action then get Dino Crisis 2. In Dino Crisis 2 it is none stop action, you kill about 12 Dinos every minute, and their are two times more dinos in Dino crisis 2 then in Dino Crisis, And their are about three times more Weapons too(And the wepons are so cool, like when you have one machine gun in each hand at the same time you are able to shoot two different Dinos at the same time). So if you like hard core shooting games(rock on) then get Dino crisis 2, but if you like puzzles(ZZZZZZZZZZZ) then get Dino Crisis."
5,Dino Crisis is resident evil but greater and much better,it's great. What else is there to say It's amazing! I almost wet myself playing it It's scary sometimes.
4,Great Starter Pack,"Bought this for a 3 day hiking trip and I thought it worked out great. The trip was my first trip truely secluded from the outside world. The pack held everything I needed and more, I didn't have the best packing method at first, but it didn't matter because this was large enough to make up for my inefficient packing. The back is lightweight, roomy and comfortable because it can be easily adjusted in various ways. The only bad thing I have to say is my buddy a a 60 liter and his bag held just as much, but appear to be more compact. I think it might have to do with all the padding to this pack because this didn't seem to be any heavier, just more bulky. For the price, I think this was a great price and I would recommend to anyone who is just starting out on a hiking adventure. Once I master packing I might move onto something else, but very happy with the purchase.Pros - Roomy, Lightweight, Comfortable, Price, and all the nice accessoriesCons - No complaints so far"
1,Did not work,"This is a waste of money, still went overdue and had to be induced. Tastes like chocolate syrup. Don't buy unless you are bored and have lots of cash."
4,Ernestine Anderson at her best,"This is my favorite Ernestine Anderson album: a nice mix of studio and live performances. ""Body and Soul"" is my all time favorite version of this classic. ""Skylark"" is excellent and moving. Most of the other tunes are done very well indeed."
1,A total dissapointment,"This is the very first travel guide that I have felt was a total waste of my time and money. Use this guide only if you want the barest of details and the least amount of research. You can go to the tourist board sites and receive 10 times the information and to practically any other guide book for lots more hotel suggestions and information. The chapter on Aruba was the worst! It list only one hotel (La Cabana Resort) which is across the street from the beach and although a nice find for families - definately NOT a secret hideaway type hotel. I could have wrote this book in my first year in the travel business with my eyes closed. Did anyone even go see these resorts? It sure does not sound like it. Do yourself a favor and buy Ian Keowns Hideaways or even a Foder or Frommer guide! Or better yet, find an experienced travel agent who knows the caribbean and has actually seen the resorts and hotels!"
5,Motion Sensor,When I purchased six of the motion sensors I did not think that I was getting but a fair product.When I got them we connected them up and to my suprise they worked better than I had hoped. When buying electronics online it is scary even when you know what you want and what it is suppose to be.I intend on buying several more.Thanks
5,An excellent view of a day in the life of 'N SYNC!!!!!,'N Sync the Official Book is a looking glass into the life of 'N SYNC. It truely shows what the lifes of these five fab guys were like before their musical debu. This book helps you get to know the sexy guys who make up this incredible group.
5,"Wonderful, gave info from childhood to now on our fav guys!","I think this book really explained well what our favorite guys were thinking when getting started, when they were younger, and about their success now. Not to mention the HOT pictures throughout the book! I love it...I read the whole book the day I got it. Thanks for a great book K. M. Squires!!!"
2,"Too much fluff, not enough substance.","I enjoy N'Sync's music, but I felt this book didn't capture the creative process that goes into crafting a masterpiece. The book lacked details on the record contracts and negotiations, and other supporting personnel: agents, lawyers, hand-holders, management, financial advisers, etc. Possibly the publishers would consider updating this information in a future edition. Also, there were way too many pictures. Honestly, I'd leave out all the pictures, except maybe one on the cover. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy their music--this book, however, didn't capture their true story."
4,Who knows?Who cares?,"N OK GAME. i have not actully played it yet and it will probably stink like poo-poo. it may be half-way decent, but probably not, it most likely stink like poo-poo."
5,"Marx Brothers in another of my favorites, and in great COLOR..","The Marx Brothers were great..and in COLOR..is even better. The colorization is tremendous and makes this film look like it was in color in the first place. The complaints from producers, and directors were well justified originally, when color was added to the early black and white movies.They came out brown and yellow..the rich supreme colorization later did not compare to the first ones. Lucille Ball is a main character here..and they have her hair as red as it was later in the TV color shows she did after LUCY. Lots of slap-stick and fast jokes . If you haven't seen this film, try to get one they have colored..it is worth it..!"
3,Bootleg,Without an official release being available this DVD is very much second-best. Visual and audio quality is quite poor for the price and should be labelled as an unofficial bootleg copy. It`s a shame as there are some fascinating period scenes of Paris and Marseilles and fans of Citroen cars will not be disappointed.
4,great cover!,"This helps you keep cards and other things in one place...and what is great it keeps the palm pilot from getting dirty! The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is that it was suppose to be free..and it wasn't ....so beware of the free case offer! Amazon didn't back the ""free case"" offer that was offered..."
5,The Witch's Shied,Well written easy to understand book. Lots of complex ideas simplified. The CD very helpful. Great book for those new to the craft.
1,Seriously Disappointed,"I was excited to receive my new cordless phone battery and for the first 2 weeks it worked great, however, now the stupid phone won't stay charged for more than 5 minutes. If I'm on the phone for a few minutes it will start beeping at me saying that it needs to be recharged. It is very frustrating and I will never buy a product from them again! The price might be tempting, but don't buy this battery. It will wish you would have paid a little more for a battery that works!"
2,this game is down and out,"I rented this game once thnking I would be up all night playing it. I went to sleep at 10:15 that night. This game has nothing to do. There are two modes, championship and arcade. Championship is where you pick a guy and go threw all these matches to uventually beat everybody and unlock someone else to do the exact same thing. You end up doing this for all 20 or so characters. Very boring. The arcade mode is just free fights. Go and pick your boxer and have your opponent pick theres and you fight. Again. very boring. If you want a good fighting game go for Knockout Kings."
2,It's Only a Part Of CCR's Story...,"This ""CCR Critical Review"" is just a part of the real and true story because the lider of the band, John Fogerty, doesn't appear in this DVD. I don't like some opinions of Stu Cook and Doug Clifford after a long long time ago speaking bad things about Fogerty while they are touring up today as ""Creedence Clearwater Revisited"" playing all the hits of their ""enemy"". It's not a good example to follow..."
2,Music in Review Creedence Clearwater Revival,"I must say I am truly impressed with the great efficiency of the shipping as well as the way my order was processed. There is however one thing that is of great displeasure to me and that has to do with the contents of the product itself. For all intents and purposes, these two DVDs are nearly identical. Both DVDs are about Creedence Clearwater, granted, but except for an extra commentator on one DVD, these two are nearly the same and frankly, I find neither to be all that good. One DVD, even claimed we would see COMPLETE live performances of a small list of songs, which was unfortunately not true at all."
5,Neat story,My 4yo daughter loves unicorns and enjoys hearing this story. This will be a book that she will reading herself as she ages.
3,Worked Really Well at First,"This was a good product at first, but after 6 months, the slant did not align. Now it can not grab onto anything."
5,Love it!,Can't wait to use it at farmers market's and fairs in the summer! Every child should have a wagon like this!
5,Ordered on Friday got it on Monday!,We ordred 2 wagons for our grandchildren. It's been a family tradition for years! My husband put the wagons together with no problems and the kids loved them! Well worth the money!
5,Perfect for your Little ones!,"THis is awesome for my 16month old and her friends to ride on. The older they get, they will be able to play and haul stuff around the yard! Its great! better than the old Radion Flyer wagon I had as a child. very Sturdy!"
1,do not buy on amazon,please do not purchase this item from amazon. It is very heavy and mine showed up at my door with the box having multiple tears. UPS did not take good care of the box and because it had holes in it- the wood was scratched and broken in many different areas. I returned the wagon and they sent me a replacement which showed up the same way broken AGAIN! I am going to just buy one at a local toy store instead. When I called customer service to discuss this - i asked if they can put the wagon box in a bigger box with some bubble wrap and they said NO! I still order from Amazon but now only books and other small items.
3,Adequate,Nice little wagon for the little tikes. Wood construction is adequate but the wheels are extremely cheap. Plastic rims and semi rubber tires. It is definitely not constructed for anything more than very light duty work. I have concerns that the wheels won't last a long time. The wood carriage with some proper care will last for years but the tires and wheels just don't make the grade. I will probably upgrade to better tires and wheels within the next 6 months. Bought this for my 2 year old daughter and was hoping she would have it for years to come.
5,Fantastic Wagon,"This wagon is great. We also have the large plastic wagon with the seatbelts and so on. In hindsight, this wagon is far better. The pnumatic tires make the ride much smoother, and allow you to go through grass and across sand at the beach. The clearance on this wagon is easily high enough for me to go up and down a couple of steps with my daughter riding in it (the tires are not large enough to make this easy enough, I'll still go well out of my way to avoid more than 1 step). This wagon is pretty big, and far more usable than the trolley's hotels give you for moving your luggage up and down the stairs. Finally, it can be stored upright and is sturdy enough sitting like that."
3,Nostalgic But Not Sturdy,"I was so happy to have purchased this for our first grandchild -- looking forward to years of pulling and playing -- just as I remember doing with my Radio Flyer Wagon! However, I was very disappointed with the material used. Instead of 2x4 wood strength as I expected, it is made with very thin side slats and the bottom wood is a vaneer that is already buckling in small areas. I can't imagine that the side slats will hold up for long with the wear-and-tear of little people climbing in and out! I'm willing to be proven wrong, but still disappointed that it is not the sturdy, heavy wood construction of yester-year! I will say that our grandson loves it, and, in his own little 16 month old way, begs to ride again and again."
5,Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon,I bought this for my 3 year old grandson and he loves it. It is great for going to outside events as it is wooden and in the summer does not get hot like metal.
2,Disappointed with quality,"Purchaced this wooden based wagon for grandchild, remembering the quality of the same style wagon I bought for my kids years back. Wood base is very poor quality, thin and cheap, very dissatisfied. Highly reccomend buying metal over wood, better quality, stronger."
5,PERFECT WAGON!!!!!,I bought this wagon for my 2 year old grandson for his birthday. What a great buy! It goes over curbs and hilly type terrain with such ease. Not a lot of stress on the person pulling. We won't even mention the fact that my grandson sits in it every evening in front of the TV. He LOVES it and we cannot get him out of it! Yes it is a little pricey but it will last for years. We will never have to buy another one. The red paint does rub off so applying a clear coat is helpful.
3,disappointed in the product description,The product arrived on time. I was under the impression that the Accu-Chek Compact Plus Meter Kit came with a preloaded 17 strip drum. That was the reason I ordered the kit. I emailed the company and they told me that the 17 strip drum did not come with the drum. Under the product description it stated that it came with a preloaded drum. I was disappointed that I did not receive one. I had to go out and purchase one. I think the product description should state that the 17 strip drum does not come with it.
1,Software for device non-existant,"Companion software (360 Management System) is non-existent. Whether you attempt to download it from Acc-chek home site, Amazon,etc. it is labeled ""out of Stock"" and has been for months. Not a beep about why, or how long. Stay away from anything labeled ""Accu-chek. They claim to have latest tech (tanks, etc) but customer support is non existant. Buyer beware."
5,Very Impressed,"Item arrived today. very fast delivery. i was only expecting the unit itself and to my wonderful surprise it came with duracell batteries, controll solution, lancets and a test strip drum. very impressed with the company will definatley order from them again."
3,Older Than Expected,"Is 30 years old modern? How many changes have there been in Catholic doctrine and understanding since the fairly early days of JP-II? I was expecting something newer, even though it was used. Other than that, it seems to be pretty good."
3,Error in the Languaje,"in the Product Details say:Language: English, French, Spanishbut i buy the dvd and only say:Language: English and PortugueseSubtitles: Portuguese"
4,The Robin Crush,"I grew up with a different style of Teen Titans, but when my kids stumbled on this series it wasn't long before they decided Robin was cool. Robin, the guy in tights? Wait what? Yup. That's how it started. Now they think Robin is as cool as Batman and my daughter giggles at all the hints of romance in the air. Yup."
5,teen titans,i liked this series so much i shared it with my brother. he liked it so much i bought him the entire series for his birthday. he is very happy
3,"Interesting Book, But Slapped Together Quickly","Needless to say, this book covers a topic that's suddenly timely in a way its authors couldn't possibly have imagined while they were writing it.On balance, an interesting and quick read. I felt the book suffered from a lack of editing, though. It reads like what it is -- a collection of contributions from several authors, no doubt drawing heavily on previously published work.This is a long way from being a bad book, but especially in view of 9/11, this important topic deserves a more detailed and in-depth approach."
1,Author discredited,"I would have given this a 5 star. However, the author, Judith Miller, has been seriously discredited. I cannot recommend this book to anyone. Please find a book where the author's reputation is not so completely marred."
4,Real fun but can get tricky,"This game was a lot of fun for me and my brothers. It starts out easy then gets harder and harder, but not to hard. You'll have a fun time bouncing over machines, and dodging canons. Just remember to go inside all the little cracks and hiding places. Throughout each level you can spell PACMAN for a bonus. There also is normal pacman on this too."
5,Great Game!!!,"Pac-Man World is a great game for Playstation and Playstation 2 owners. You get 3 modes of play including the original Pac-man game, as well as a 3-D adventure mode, and a 3-D over the top Dot munching game. All 3 are very fun to play, which makes this game a very good value.Recommended for those looking for a cheap, fun game, for their PSone or PS2."
4,Good semi-punk rock,"I saw them in concert in Las Vegas, and they put a lot of energy into their music. The songs tend to be fast-paced and remind me of early Ramones."
2,Why did I buy this?,"I read through the book before our trip to Paris, but did not get to use the information once. Every time I referenced it again while in Paris, I would ask myself ""Why did I buy this book?"" I am sure that it would be useful for some, but not for us. My wife is mobility-impaired and the 'projects' just required too much walking. If you were there for a significant amount of time I reckon that it could be handy."
5,An absolute must-read for ASP.NET developers!,Essential ASP.NET is 100% to-the-point containing very useful information with no fluff included. I particularly enjoyed the HTTP pipeline chapter. The entire book contains info that every ASP.NET developer should know.
5,Not just another ASP.NET book,"Having taught ASP.NET for over a year now, I think the book wouldbe an invaluable resource for students, I like the author's style which is really well thought-out. It is really a delight to read both the books. (There is a VB.NET title for the VB.NET folks)More importantly the content is delivered addressing the most common student questions along the way. It is a welcome change from books that presume to discuss the subject over hundreds of pages and missing the forest for the trees in the process. For the experienced developers it cements a lot of seemingly loose and disparate concepts.A must have for ASP.NET developers, be it beginners or the experienced. The book is even more interesting after one has done some hands on ASP.NET programming and then would like to understand what really is going under the hood.Kudos for a job well done!"
5,Solid Wagon,"This is a solid, well built wagon. We purchased this wagon to take our twins on outdoor, off-road walks. Recently took the wagon out into the muddy fields of WI to hunt for pumpkins. Great traction and the large tires make for a smoother ride than your typical wagon. The wood rails do a great job keeping squirmy kids safe. More than what we expected."
5,Love it!,"I have a 6 year old and a 6 month old and they love riding in this wagon together. I love the All-Terrain wheels and the ease at which it moves from pavement to grass. We just started using this, but I can see my family using this wagon for years to come. It will be a great help for beach trips, yard work, camping and just walking around a summer fair. Great Wagon!"
5,The best,"I bought this wagon for my niece... well really almost as much for my brother. They both absolutely love it. She's not even a year old yet, so he piles it up with blankets and snugs her down. They also bought an awning for it. He says people stop him all the time and ask him where he got it. He told me it's extremely well built and is sure it will last a very, very long time. They live in upstate NY so the larger tires are great for hard packed trails and the roads when they have snow on them."
5,Radio Flyer All-Terrain Steel and Wood Wagon,"I gave my grandson a ride in his new wagon on his first birthday, and he loved it. We purchased the pads that cushion the ride, also. It was easy to assemble and the parts are durable. I would recommend finding a way to install safety belts because if Grandma stopped pulling, her passenger tried to lean over to get out!"
2,Got Hills? Think Twice.,"You might want to think twice about getting this wagon if you live in a hilly neighborhood. I found that trying to pull this wagon up hill with 2 small kids in it is extremely strenuous...and I'm even in good shape. I thought the pneumatic tires would make it easy to pull. They do, on level ground. But any kind of incline becomes a real work out. I end up using my Bob stroller with a kiddie board attached because it's so much easier to push up hill. I thought I would also use the wagon when we go to the beach, park or zoo but it's so big it just barely fits in my Subaru Forester (no room for anything else at all so don't plan to take it on vacation). And it's very heavy so it's hard to load in the car and tricky to try to keep the handle under the wagon while loading it (that's the only way it will fit in mine). I am selling it on Craig's List after using it only a handful of times."
4,Does it rain where you live?,"Easy to assemble, but wood panels are not varnished. We used an outdoor wood varnish on ours because it rains a lot where we live. Came out beautiful. Love the wagon."
1,Such a jumbled pseudo memoir,"I chosed this book because I was looking for a behind-the-scenes look at network sensors. Instead what I got was a jubled pseudo memoir of one WASP's (his self-description) ranting about morals.If, however, you're looking for some behind-the-scenes SNL gossip, this may be your book."
3,to many options,"Spent most of the evening reading up on the controls, not simple enough for me! Seems to work fine! Needs a SVideo input for the cable to vcr not just the DVD. I woonder if the GoVideo is any better? Be sure and check it out!"
1,toshiba dvd/vcr combo,"don't have the product yet, before i buy it, I want to know if i besides playing dvd cd and vcr I can record VCR and cd movies."
2,Did not meet my expectations,"Package arrived with most of the tape torn off, but inside seemed undamaged. The first thing I noticed was that the user's manual was poorly written and very difficult to understand. Actually it looks like it had been thrown together at the last minute with a copy machine. Functionally, the DVD portion seemed to perform well but for whatever reason I couldn't even get the vcr to playback a known good tape, much less record to a blank tape. After three days of frustration I sent it back via UPS."
2,Think twice before you buy this unit!,"I thought by spending a little more on the Toshiba product I would save myself money in the long run. I assumed it would last longer and be a higher quality product. The product warranty is 3 months parts and labor and 1 year parts (you pay labor charges). I've had mine seven months, and the vhs side simply quit showing us a picture. We can hear sound, but the screen is blank. I took it to the service center where they charged an initial $37 just to look at it. I'm sure that before it's over and done with, the repair costs will be climbing upward to what a new non-Toshiba combo would be. If you have had good luck with a particular band, buy it again. If you have no prior experience with a brand, don't assume that spending more is going to get you a better product. It just simply isn't always the case."
1,Didn't even last 9 months,"Bought the unit in May 2002, it started acting up in November 2002 and suddenly would not stop playing or turn off in December 2002. Finally had to pull the plug to get it to shut off. Now it has a library video stuck inside."
5,Great Shades,Serengeti is the best.... this price was 40% lower than any local retail stores.... delivered on time
4,Test for freshness,An excellent treatment treatment of dinosaur physiologies. But be wary of its freshness. It was first published as a paperback by Penguin in 1988.
1,THE HP OFFICEJET 135D IS HAZERDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH[!],"I have owned many HP printers and for the most part have been very satisfied.However my latest purchase the HP Officejet d135 was by the worst computer purchase I have ever made and believe me, I have bought many computers in my day!If a huge company like HP is going to pitch all-for-1 type office printer they better test the darn thing before they bring it to the market.This printer has major major program and design flaws!The software has major bugsIf you own a MAC you can expect your computer to slow down and crash all the time with this printerNO SERVICE. After the treatment and service I received from HP I will never buy another product from them.I will also never recommend that anyone else buy this printer.TOO BAD, I USED TO BE A LOYAL HP CUSTOMERWARNING: THE HP OFFICEJET 135D IS HAZERDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH![.]"
1,Talk About Junk,My Officejet d135 worked fine untill about 6 months ago. I started having to replace print heads. The last time I replaced a print head all the lights on the printer started flaching and I got an error message to turn it off and on. I have done that about a hundred times with the same result. I contacted HP and after being led through one fix after another that did not work I was told that I would have to get a new printer. For 450 dollars you would think this thing would work more than a year and one half. JUNK!!!
3,COPY LEGAL SIZE PAPER,Our machine will not COPY information on legal size paper to legal size paper. It copies letter size information only. Hence result is a legal size piece of paper with three quarters of the necessary information on it.As our guide book for this machine has been misplaced I would appreciate it if someone would please inform me the steps to obtain perform this information. Been unsuccessful in obtaining another booklet.
4,Happy XP User,"4 stars for now, maybe 5 in a few days once I get use to the machine. ... The machine works great, fax is excellent, printing is great, scanner is a bit louder than the ones in the store setting, but is acceptable. New software has full functions under XP from the computer. ... This is a great machine for the money."
1,A piece of junk,"This printer fails frequently. Printheads have to be replaced (at considerable expense) and error messages constantly pop up. It will say ""IDS failure -- call HP,"" but when you call HP, they want to charge you $35 before they even speak to you.This is the single worst product I have EVER owned. I will never by an HP product ever again, as they do not stand behind their lousy product."
1,My complaint about this printer is,"My complaint about this printer is that when the print cartridge expires, doesn't matter if the cartridge is full, the printer won't print and it will tell you that the cartridge has expried! So now when you buy an ink cartridge, you have to look at the expiration date! I put a newly bought black ink cartridge in and within 2 weeks it had expired and now it won't print until I replace it! The black & color cartridge together is $56, then you have to worry about these individual color ink heads or something like that, which cost $34 each! So for me to get this copier working again it will cost about $200! I've always been an HP person, but this copier is definately a MONEY PIT$$$ The worse copier HP has ever put out, and possibly the worse copier EVER made!! Stay clear of this one!!"
3,"Dystopia effectively, grimly mixing noir with cyberpunk.","For fans of Hammett and Chandler, NOIR will sound comfortingly -- and discomfortingly -- familiar, for Jeter respects the genre of noir fiction and has handled its conventions with skill and panache. For fans of cyberpunk, NOIR will revisit familiar themes in effective and disturbing ways; Philip K. Dick would have admired this book. For those who believed that the two genres could not be crossbred, NOIR will be a revelation.And yet...I wanted to like this book (and had I liked this book I would have given it four stars), but I only ended up admiring it (hence three stars). For the central character in NOIR acts with a brutality that at one or two points goes far beyond the boundaries of noir and well into the territory of sadism. It would give too much away to those who want to read the book to go into specifics. Suffice it to say that NOIR is emphatically NOT a book for the tender-hearted or the squeamish."
1,"Interesting world, but plot is not what is expected.","The author appears to be using the book mostly as a platform to harangue against copyright violations, as well as provide some chilling ideas on what should be done to the violators. The bulk of the story is essentially a wrapper/filler around this concept as it meanders along trying to provide a coherent plot. The book would have been much stronger (and a better read) if more time had been spent developing the tale itself; as it is, the book doesn't really answer any of the questions brought up in the storyline."
2,Could use a little more structure...,"I'm disappointed with this novel. I found the main character implausible: his cyber-eyes are not very credible, and even the author seems to forget how they should work for dozens of pages. His work is even less plausible. The Collection Agency and the episode in which the main character does one of his ""jobs"" seems to just be an excuse to rant about the author's view on copyright. Lastly, the final part with the showdown against the main villain is more than a little confusing, and the evil-megacorporation-plot-against-everything-and everybody is cliched and, again, not very plausible, either on technical or social grounds. I suspect that the book was put together under some kind of pressure, and the various parts don't seem to fit well together."
2,Review 14 ft trampoline cover,The cover needed two people to put it on which was a bit of a pain. It fitted really well the first time but I think it may have shrunk in the weather because the next time we tried to put it on it wouldn't quite fit.
5,Very cool cards,"This are really cool FIFA World Cup Germany 2006 soccer cards, and I got only 5 repeated cards in the whole box."
3,They pack a puch for short distances,I shoot in the 80-100 yard distance and these are a little heavy for that distance. They work great in the 30-30 yard range.
5,no problems,"I purchased the 14' Airzone trampoline elsewhere and this enclosure fit perfectly, I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews. However, I had no problems and it's great, the kids love it!I did need to contact customer service, because of an error on my part, but they replied to the email within 24 hours.Total time to put the trampoline and enclosure together, starting with opening the boxes until ready to jump was about 3 hours for two adults."
5,Goodnight Mr. Tom,"John Thaw at his best. This film sees the growth of a relationship between two people. A miserable old village handyman and a evacuee from WW2 London, given to his charge by the government. His initial reluctance to have a young stranger in his home subsides as MR. Tom realises how important he is to the boy when the details of his life in London with a mentally ill mother are revealed to him.There are moments of real trauma for the boy, which makes the honesty of Mr. Tom's feelings for him ever the more powerful. More than just a happy ending, more like an incredible relief."
4,Goodnight Mister Tom,A superb but gentle drama for anyone who has a warm heart inside their body. Very plausible acting from the young boy and mentor John Thaw as the 'defrosting' senior. Not a tear jerker but the warmth of the human spirit and heart show through the tragedy of this kid's family setting and England struggling with war. A good narrative with some lovely rural settings. Very satisfying.
4,A worthy companion to a heart-warming book,"The entire contents of Goodnight Mister Tom could never fit into a two-hour movie, but I had tears in my eyes in nearly every scene. Having read the book countless times, I was keenly aware of the emotions the characters were experiencing, and was not disappointed. Often movie adaptations don't live up to their parent-books, but I came away from this viewing with the same feelings I have coming away from the book each time. Any fan of Goodnight Mister Tom will cherish this video."
5,Great book - could not put it down!,This book was excellent reading. Had a hard time putting it down!
2,"Better than Nativity in Black 2, but is still bad....",Just for hardcore fans of Black Sabbath (really?) who also enjoys death metal..hey wait a minute i like sabbath and i like death metal so...for whom is this cd? the only sabbath tribute is worth your money is Nativity in Black 1 (nativity in black 2 is the worstest).... don't buy this...really....
1,How WW managed to murder one of the best concept mainstream RPG games,"This game used to be the best by far in old WoD edition. Seriously, I don't understand how could people who developed something as cool and inventive as the old Mage come up with this piece of manure.Just don't buy it. Save yourself the pain."
2,Shockingly Strange,"This interpretation of O'Neill's, Long Day's Journey Into Night, was a bit over the top for me. I was slightly taken aback by Hepburn's performance as Mary. I think this presentation was a tad overdone for my taste. Many times I found myself cringing during her lines. I did, however, enjoy the book, where I could interpret the character to my own liking. Perhaps that was why I didn't some of the performances. In my mind they were less dramatic. It wasn't all bad, the young man portraying Edmund did put on a heartfelt and believable performance. All in all the book was done with impeccable taste and value, but the movie could have been toned down a notch."
5,My favorite Buddhist introductory text,"Harvey does a wonderful job of introducing the reader to the Buddhism of the Buddha. Then he takes you through the development of Buddhism country by country, showing you how mythology and cultural influences were then added to give us the different denominations we have now."
2,OK for text book use,I read this book hoping for a clear understanding of Buddhism. This book is written very bland. Very few pictures too. I find it difficult to read and follow.
4,INTRIGUING SCENARIO AND GREAT READ,"This book presented a lot of problems for college basketball and the NCAA. The writer looks into a problem that has happened in the basketball world, but never at such of a magnitude as the NCAA Final Four. Gambling won't ever go away, but if this ever happened in the real world, this kid will make millions off this book because everyone will be out buying. And they should anyhow--it's excellent, especially for young kids who play basketball."
4,Better than the first one! Quarantined with the luggage!,"Went into this one thinking it would probably be worse than the firstQuarantine. It was far better and probably should have been made instead of the first one which was shot for shot a bad copy of[Rec], which was a much better version.Most of this movie takes place on the ground or tarmac in the luggage delivery section of the airport and is not a ripoff ofFlight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Planeas another reviewer stated. Although technically not a zombie film, it's close enough. IE: they're infected and look it, they bite you, you become infected and look it.. Sounds pretty zombie to me!This takes place at the same time as the events inQuarantine.The reason behind the infection is revealed in the movie.This 720p Stream looked fantastic on my HD Plasma! None of the scenes were too dark."
4,GREAT MOVIE:),"This was a very good movie,To me is was much better than REC2 ,Which seemed more like a video game.I Thought this movie would be a waste but it was actually worth the watch,It was better than the first one."
1,Doesn't Work,I was so disappointed. This device counts calories while laying on a table! Totally doesn't work don't waste your time.
5,Great mix of comedy and romance!,I've seen this movie over and over and think it's one of David Nivin's best. Great comic acting and a wonderful pairing of stars keep this movie tops on my list. Wonderful ending.
2,Poor quality copy,A comic classic that has been poorly copied.Wait until a more reputable company releasesit. Video quality is bad.
5,Cute,"this is a cute/fun movie about a women who is mistakenly thought to be the mother ofan orphan - fast pace, good characters and great ending"
4,Clive Barker brings back one of our best disturbing images.,"Hellraiser 2 pretty much left off where the original did. The ending was when Pinhead took Kirsty's dad to hell. And Kirsty wasall bloody, and knew that her nights of hell were not over, so inHellraiser 2 Kirsty was going to go to hell to rescue her father, which pinhead needs to help raise hell on earth. But Pinhead isn't alone. he's got some buddies that'll kick in when he needs them to! Kirsty was feared about that. But she can getall the help she needs, but its sad that nobody believes poor Kirsty, so then she finds weaknesses and then faces off the same demon again: PINHEAD!"
2,If you thougt the first one was scary.....,Picking up where the first one left off kirsty is in a mental institution being studied by the evil docter chinard who wants to open the gates of hell for further study and gets alot more than he bargained for kirsty goes to the depths of hell looking for her father going in to the world of demons and murderers and eventually the evil docter chinard where the laberynth is found hellraiser 2 is scaryer and bloodyer than the first this is where I Beleave the movie series should have stopped
1,Hellbound Is Right!,"I didn't think it could get any worse than the original. I was so, so wrong. Hellrasier 2 is just as dark, cold, violent, and impossible to enjoy. The acting is of high camp value that is hard to take seriously at all. Pinhead is an interesting character, but he's used too thinly and performed too boring to really mean anything. The movie is just violent for violent's sake. Ridiculous, empty, and unenjoyable."
2,vga converter,"This does not work very well. my son has been disappointed, it will not support PS2 and XBOX at the same time. The only game system that plays on it well is the Xbox."
4,Great book but a small caution for parents,"Overall this is a great book, really cute with nice pictures and my son loves it. I do have one small warning for parents with really young kids though, the cover touch and feel has fibers which are just long enough that a baby can get a good grip and yank a few out which in most cases then goes directly in the child's mouth. The fibers are really well secured to the book so they don't come out in clumps but a few fibers will come out here and there if you child is determined and strong. Either keep and eye on you baby while they use this book or wait until they are a little older and less likely to shove the loose fibers in their mouth.Otherwise, this is a really nice book and one of my son's favorites."
1,OS X LION - NOT compatible - NOT advertised,"We bought this to find out it does not run under OSX Lion. It says Mac Compatible in the add on Amazon, this is a LIE. Don't buy this unless you are running something that is Rosetta Compatible, This is false advertising to not include this on the website. We didn't find out until we tried to install it on our Mac Mini. The site even says OS X compatible. SHAME ON YOU Amazon. OS X has been Lion for several months now, you had better review your software compatibility facts and point out those that are NOT OS X COMPATIBLE."
5,Wow,"Got this in vinyl YEARS ago, and am happy to find it on CD. Still don't know what all of it means, but even to an english-only speaker the tone conveys sooooooo much."
5,Anarchic Fun from a British Author.,"A story from the incorrigible Mr Dahl for slightly younger children. I am a Brit, and bought this as a gift for my American friend's 6 year old. My children have loved it, and I'm sure he will too."
2,Typical Uninspired Fusion,"The group sounds so imposing on paper, but when I listened to the album, I was really disappointed by the lack of true interplay and Tony's inappropriate use of metal shred licks in a jazz-fusion format. Tony's got ways to go before he can really feel comfortable in this kind of a musical setting. Dennis Chambers is an amazing drummer, but even the best drummer will not be able to save an album of bland compositions and uninspired playing. Scott Henderson's Tribal Tech is a much better bet for the high-energy fusion genre."
2,"Very interesting, but not scary","The subject matter is very interesting and the team appears to be genuine, but this video is in no way scary. Overall, it is just a group of people standing around talking. They should have taken more time to show us the EMF and temp meters, or tried to film the ghosts or record sounds. It left me wishing they had done more to bring the viewer in. Not scary."
4,A Writers Reference,A Writers Reference is a good book to use to help write papers. It is well organized in that you don't have to flip through an entire chapter or wade through pages of index while looking for a certain topic. It is a real time saver.
1,Homeopathic but requires prescription?,"Homeopathic ""medicine"" is made by vastly diluting ingredient(s) to the point of statistically not having even a single molecule of those original ingredient(s) left (to a extremely high probability). It is absolutely 100% safe...Given that this requires a prescription would make me think it is not Homeopathic.And even if it is Homeopathic medicine it has no scientifically supported means of effectiveness and scientific studies in general show no effect beyond placebo.To learn more look up homeopathy on Wikipedia."
3,plastic,It arrived in two plastic containers not the container the picture shows. They should probably change the pictures to match the product description
4,Not since Narnia have I had so much fun!,"After reading Hunger Games I thought- more Suzanne Collins- why not? These are fun, juvenile, yes, but fun quick reads and you grow to love Gregor and Boots."
5,Do yourself a favor and get the whole series so you save some money,You will want to read the whole series so save a few dollars and buy the set. I read all five books and enjoyed the story line and the characters. It took me some time to get used to the strange way folks in the Underland spoke but once I got over that I enjoyed the whole series.
4,Cute Story,"This series would be great for mature middle school students. I bought this book after finishing Suzanne Collins ""The Hunger Games"" series (<not for middle school students!); wanting more! I read all of the Underland Chronicles, and enjoyed the journey. There is a heavy moral to be had, which youth around the world should consider. The only problem I had was the age of the lead character, Gregor. In the book he is said to be 11 going on 12; however, it would be much more believable if he was to be 15 going on 16 (yes I know it is just a story). All in all, it was a good series :)"
5,a 3rd grader's point of view,"I love this book! If you like adventure stories and animals, you will like this book. It is very suspenseful. A lot of the characters like Luxa are very interesting. If you do not like fighting and battles, you will not like this book. Some of the characters die, but it is not too sad. I complained for a week because I couldn't read the second book!"
4,The amazing book of Gregor the Overlander,Gregor the Overlander is a great book because there is a lot of excitement. You will love this book it is amazing. It is about Gregor and Boots in the underworld with Vikus and Luxa. They go to fulfill the prophecy with four other characters. They go to get Gregor's father who at first looks like a rat but is a human. The cockroaches are some of my favorite characters because they're so generous t boots by giving up their food to give it to her. Gregor the Overlander is an amazing book with a lot of action and excitement.
2,"Gregor, The Overlander",The Hunger Games trilogy was fantastically much better than this first book of the Overlander series. It didn't make me want to read the second or third book in this series. I just didn't care what happened next. This series is definitely more for kids than adults.
2,Not the hunger games,Ok but kind of predictable. It was worried too much about feelings. I have read the hunger games trilogy and would highly recommend it. I hope her next book is great like the huger games and not like the underland chronicles. I think it will be because she is becoming a greater author as she goes.
3,Gregor the Overlander an okay book,"Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins was an okay book but if you like adventure this is the book for you. It is about Gregor and his little sister Boots who fall down the laundry chute and end up in the Underland. When they are in the Underland they find there selves in Regalia which is one of the cities. They meet the queen and are told about how their dad has been in the Underland and the prophecy says that Gregor and Boots need to go off and find their dad. They meet giant roaches, bats, spiders, and rats while on their way to fulfill the prophecy to find their dad. Some parts of the book were boring and moved slowly because there was not a whole lot going on. Overall Gregor the Overlander was an okay book but again I would recommend it to those who like adventure."
3,Meh...,It was alright...I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't the kind of book I thought about if I wasn't actually reading it. I would put it down and forget about it for days.
4,science fiction type,"The book wasn't quite what I expected, but it turned out to be very good. I don't usually read science fiction type books."
3,"Good, easy, YA fantasy read","Gregor and his baby sister go down a hole in thier laundry room and discover an entire underworld filled with taking insects and other amusing underlings. This was an entertaining, albeit slightly younger than I anticipated, fantasy story easily consumable in slow afternoon or over the weekend."
4,good,"This was not as good as The Hunger Games,but it was still worth reading. If you want something way different then the HG,but by the same author I would suggest this book."
4,gregor,for young readers I was disapointed because I thought it would be hunger games style but find it was for kids 8-10 I didnt finish it but I belive it is a good book for young readers.
4,"Great detail, neat concept, great for young adult audience","Great detail, neat concept, quick read, great for young adult audience. Book left off in a way that you don't have to purchase the rest of the series, but it's available if you'd like to check out the characters next adventure"
2,Underland Chronicles,I had just finished reading the three Hunger Games books and I feel this was not up to the same standard.
5,Great Fantasy,I went into this book thinking it was the only one! I am so thankful that its not! This was an awesome story! The imagination and fantasy in this book is off the charts! If you love Jules Vernian fantasy then this is right up your alley with giant critters from the deep earth! A must read!
4,NICE SERIES,"This series, the Underland series is a great book for middle school and high school readers. Heck, I enjoyed it and i am well above school age. But I think of it highly for younger reads. Smooth quick moving fantasy with other volumes to come. Recommended"
1,gregor the overlander reviews.,i think the book is awsome.luxa probuly like gregor .fangor is a fool but any way boots is the star of the book. james frazier
3,Gregor the Underwhelming,"The book was OK, but I just felt it was a little too by-the-book. Especially the reluctant hero bit.And, am I the only one who hates Boots? I mean I know that's a horrible thing to say but she did not bring anything to the table and I could not stand her babyspeak.I did notice that Mrs. Collins showed occasionally showed her the trademark cliffhanger which she does with so much flair in The Hunger Games trilogy which was cool.Let's just say that the book is good enough you'll read it all the way through but it's not the kind of book you'll want to read again and again."
3,The Spark of an Adventure,"Gregor the Overlander is an exciting adventure. Gregor who is the main character gets into trouble in and has to bring back light to the Underland. Gregor lives in an apartment in New York. His mom, grandma, and his two sisters live with him. One of his sister's Lizzie is going to camp and Gregor is stuck at home watching his other sister Margret but everyone calls her Boots. Boots falls into this square into the dark Underland and Gregor follows her to start a quest."
2,Disc two is a reject,Amazon kindly shipped two sets due to a defective disc number 2; it would not load in the player but would load on a computer. Amazon is now refunding my money. I tried purchasing at other retail outlets locally hoping for a different factory run but had the same problem - only on disc two. OK if all you want is two discs in a three disc set.
4,Disc 2 Problem,"Another great season of Home Improvement, definitely one of my all time favorite TV shows. My only complaint is that the video on disc 2 is kind of funky. It's feels like you're watching it in slow motion, or like every other frame was removed. This problem occurs on about half of the episodes on this disc. I think that the company is obligated to fix this problem and that everyone who has bought a copy is entitled to a replacement of disc 2. I think that all fans should try calling technical support and mentioning this error and maybe even write the company about it.I personally don't have any real problem with the packaging of the season. I always prefer saving shelf space. I also can't complain at all about the price that I got this season for. It was on sale at Best Buy for $17.00!"
5,Finally!,Finally their releasing season 6! i cant wait for this! i have seasons 1-5 and they get even funnier when the kids are older!I cant wait!
3,Claws fall off,"I bought this for my seven year old. It looks great, and he liked it a lot, but the three claws on the arms started falling off right away. You can pop them back on after they fall off, but once they fall off they are easily lost. I think that this is best for someone who wants to put it on a shelf to look at instead of younger children who want to actively play with it."
4,Soundstream SST5.7,"These aren't the best speakers i've ever used, but they certainly get the job done. Don't even bother hooking them up to stock head, you need an amp on these speakers to make the sing. Highs are a little dry for my taste, but these speakers excel in mids and bass. I have a 10"" sub and I barely need that turned up with these speakers in the back. Pair these with a nice set of front speakers and your car will sound awesome."
5,Most capitivating,"This is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The child is just exceptional. Few mins into the movie and i was crying and then through out i kept crying in sobs... She has portrayed the character so beautifully for such a tender age. I kept remembering how it felt when i lost my father 5 years back. This movie will help heal anyone who has encountered loss, irrespective of your age. Please watch it."
3,Only a 4-year-old could act that well.,"Unfortunately, the only strength of this movie is superb acting by Thivisol (and other little actors). The drama of death of a parent has simplistic nature as experienced by a child, and therefore, failed to create emotions or provoke thoughts from viewers; except pity (for the girl) and awe (for the actress). For better movies with no-less-than-first-rate tiny actors, check out: Le Grand Chemin (French), Kolya (Czech), Burnt by the Sun, and The Thief (Russian)."
2,"Visually Dynamic, Weakly Written","At his weakest, series executive producer Leslie Stevens' scripts were talky and unconvincing. This is one of those scripts. However, even in those talky and unconvincing scripts, the visual effects were usually pretty striking. And here, they're pretty striking.What sinks this episode is technical-sounding doubletalk, and a lot of it. Stevens' speculations about the nature of the afterlife, and the science of metaphysics, are genuinely interesting. If he could have stuck more to the point, he would have been more effective.Still, the sets are impressive (the series blew a lot of its budget early on, ironically on its lesser shows), the visual effects are truly eye-catching, and the finale is actually quite dramatically satisfying and even moving."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this game thinking it was what it claimed to be ""Classic"" Bubble Bobble. Buyer beware, this is not what the game turned out to be. The colors were very good, but the gameplay left a lot to be desired. The game was pathetically easy and offered up only about 60 levels. The bubbles were difficult to pop and way too easy to jump on. All in all, give me the classic on the NES any day over this poorly made modern version."
1,Strictly New Age Christian,"This is beautiful New Age, Christian music sung by women who are exploiting their Cherokee ancestry. This is nice music if you're a New Ager, a Christian, or a Christian Cherokee. But if you are a Cherokee who holds the traditional Cherokee beliefs dear, you might find this music downright insulting."
3,An OK Follow up CD,"I admit that I like this CD better as I listen to it more, but it just can't compare to the first release, Walela. Then again, that other title was so good, I'm not sure how the artists could follow it! There are several tracks I like a lot, such as Smoke in the Wind and Bright Morning Star, but there are others that I program to skip when I play the CD. If you want to get one CD by Walela, I recommend the first release. If you have that one, then you will like this one as well. You could likely enjoy it more than i did, especially if you have a slight urge to listen to country/bluegrassy music."
5,How the Trollusk Got his Hat,This is an enchanting and inventive story by a master storyteller and it appeals to both children and adults. The trollusk is a delightfully lovable little monster and everyone rejoices when he succeeds in his quest.
2,AMERICAN BOXE IS MUCH BETTER,THIS BOOKS DOESN'T TALK THE TECHNIQUES OF THE WING CHUN KUNG FU. YOU ONLY USE YOUR HANDS IN FIGHTS THAT NOWBODY FIGHTS LIKE THAT. IF YOU WANNA LEARN HOW TO USE YOUR FISTS TRAIN YOURSELF IN AMERICAN BOXE. THIS BOOKS IS NOT A KUNG FU BOOK.
3,Historical rather than authoritative,"This book should not be considered as a complete or even accurate portrayal of the chinese martial arts. Originally published in 1963, it must have been one of the few books in print on ""gung-fu"" and novel at the time (if it ever sold significant copies). Witness the introduction written by James Y Lee (Lee's good friend) in which Lee is described as ""one of the highest authorities in the Chinese Art of Gung Fu in the United States today."" Compared with what is available today, this book is rather basic and idiosyncratic. There is some Chinese philosophy, a listing of styles, some waist and leg exercises. A larger part of the book consists of photographs of Lee demonstrating responses to various attacks by opponents - the usual fare of martial arts books. The book ends with a some apparently ""filler"" photos of Lee's visit to a karate studio. The book has a homemade, hodge-podge feel to it and would appeal to Bruce Lee fans."
3,"First Edition- bought it, don't want it.","I bought this book a few months ago. It's a first Edition from 1963, not a reprint. It's not too informative. What's it worth?"
3,Book is short for its price,This is basically a step by step series of attack/defenses. It acts as a sort of overview of kung fu in about 50 pages or so.. so it misses a lot and is not in depth. The text is short so there is not much for the advanced student but it is not aimed at the beginner either. Spend [a little] more and get some book on Jeet kune do or a different kung fu book.
5,"Sleepy Time really makes it ""sleepy time""","I've been using the tea for about 3 months now about an hour before ""wanting"" to go to sleep, and it literally makes me sleepy. I know it probably won't work the same way with everyone, but it sure helps me wind down after a long day and go to sleep."
4,LOVE IT!! But...,"This product actually worked for me! Very surprised to read all these bad reviews. Now I do have light colored hair, and it is thinner then most peoples.. Not sure if that's why, but I have tried a lot of things and this is the only one that has ever worked! You do have to lay it on pretty thick & be sure to not leave it on sensitive areas (face,brows) for too long. Dont understand why anyone would pay for ""no no"" or expensive waxing or lazer treatments, when you can just do this.. & hopefully be done with it!**UPDATE** After purchasing Revitol from several different vendors, I've found that many of the bottles have plastic shards in them! I still love the product, results over time are fantastic (noticing less & less hair coming back) plus the hair that does grow back is much finer. Just wish I could find bottles without the plastic shards in them. Many people have written the bottle clogs up, that's bc of the stupid plastic shards inside!!"
2,A Whole Lot Of Enya.,"Cheaper than the imported ""Box Of Dreams"", but about three diskstoo long for anyone but devoted fans. Pick up the single disk ""Paint The Sky With Stars"", it hits all the highlights. ""Watermark"", her first proper album, discounting the BBC Celts soundtrack, was a refreshing debut. What has followed since has been more of the same...one or two nice tunes surrounded by ethereal filler. Enya is best when taken in small doses as was the case with her contribution to the ""Lord Of The Rings"" soundtrack."
5,Wonderful Book,"I first checked Painting Flowers A to Z out from the public library. After having reviewed the book, I wanted my very on copy as a reference because I found it to be very useful. I love how the author, Sherry C. Nelson, illustrated her techniques with simple step instructions and with good photo illustrations. I use this book as a reference tool because of it ease of use. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning to paint flowers."
2,painting flowers,This book is a good book for people with little imagination who just want to copy/paste a flower. There is a strong lack of imagination and personality. Poor colours. Was disappointed.Would not buy it again.
1,Did not work AT ALL. Do NOT buy this product.,I truly believe this product is a complete scam. I have never felt so taken for money in my life. too bad i got 4 bottles. lesson learned... research the reviews for a product BEFORE you buy always!
1,Doesn't work,Tried five times using nearly a full tube each time. I purchased the multiple tube deal since the reviews were so convincing on their web sites. Very hard to remove the last half or product from the tube. Totally worthless. The reviews couldn't have been accurate. I left it on for the max time of 30 minutes my last and final try. Didn't work at all.
1,Not impressed with first try,"I've only used this once and was not impressed. I used it on my legs and have course thick hair. It did not remove all of the hair, in fact perhaps only about 30% of it over an extended amt of time...25min. Perhaps, I need to use a larger quantity of it, but then this bottle will be done in about 4 applications."
3,"Fun, but WAY too easy","When I opened the package and put it into my gameboy color I thought to myself, WOW! now I have a really good game. Of course this was the first game I got. It has pretty good graphics, but the problem is that it dosn't have a point. It is a top to bottem scroling game, where you have to shoot the ememys that come onto your screen. you have one wepon, the machine gun, but they shouldn't call it that because if you hold the fire button down it shoots a little faster than once per second. The only other move you can do is a loop, it will help you dodge one or two enemys at a time, but you can only use the loop 3 times per level. every 2-4 levels there is a boss, a huge bomer, he will shoot 5 bullets at a time at you. I beat this game in about 3 days, and I thought it was to easy, and the ending really [was not very good].I recomend this game to people who like pointless shoot-em-up games that are easy to beat."
4,Very Good for Technical Skill-Building,"While I agree with the reviewer who said the video is dated, the technical skills taught are very good. It doesn't matter that you cannot hear him very well, just watch and then practice. I also agree that the videos (we have the set) are not the highest production quality, but that's far outweighed by the benefits. He really breaks down the skills into pieces, and always offers several ways to develop your ability. Worth it if you'll practice!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"Purchased this along with Logitech's WingMan Force 3D joystick and it was a waste of a lot of money. The range of motion required to make the basic up, down, left, right moves just isn't there. Its either the software, the joystick or both. I would have been better off trying to buy one of the old arcade machines and would have at least been able to play it.Don't waste your money!!"
3,its alright,"The space is nice, but it is slower than imaginable. I have never seen something take so long to store a 5 picture burst.. it takes almost 6 seconds for me. Not that I am a professional or anything, but if your subject is moving relatively quickly, 6 seconds is long enough for it to be gone after you snap your first few."
1,Nikon D70 would not recognize the card,"I was really looking forward to taking this card on a trip to Europe later this month; however, when I recieved the card and tried it out in the camera I got a ""CHA"" error code, which means the card is incompatable/ not functioning. I then updated the D70's A and B firmware to 2.0 (thinking this would solve the problem) and tried it again with the same results. I tried formatting it in the camera but that failed as well. The drive is listed compatable with the D70 and I've never gotten a CHA code before with any other cards so I know its not the camera, so maybe I just got a bad drive... is easy enough to return to amazon though, so its going back. btw the firmware on the drive was 3.01"
3,"Good value for size, not for performance","I picked this up due to the size and price. While a great value for it's price, the performance was less than great.This card is slow. Taking pictures from my Canon Rebel XT I could get maybe 5-6 shots in a row and then the camera was busy for at least a minute or so. On a regular CF card I can get about 15 shots before it gets busy and even then it stops pretty quickly. Transferring from the card to a PC or Mac also took forever.If you have a slow camera or don't expect to take many fast action shots were you need to be able to snap quickly, than this product is a great value for it's size. Just be prepared for the slowness and do all your transfer to the PC when you have plenty of time."
1,Absurd!,"Lured by the attractive price and high storage I decided to step outside the world of CF cards and try the microdrive. As a professional photographer who shoots primarily studio work I disregarded how fragile these cards are whispered to be, after all I'm not even walking around with my camera right?After the second week I noticed a CF ERR pop on my Canon. Hmm, probably just an oddity. Two weeks later a longer CF ERR, had to pop the card out and back in - I lost about eight shots.Well, today it's dead. I don't mean not fast (which it never was), I don't mean buggy (which it always was), I mean dead. D-E-A-D.Of course Amazon won't take it back because I just passed my 30 days! Yay.What a waste. I will never buy another Seagate product again."
1,Beware Canon 20D owners!,"Totally agree with review by KIDPHOTO on 3/6/06. Very disappointed in that the 3.01 firmware on the microdrive is not very compatible with lastest Canon EOS 20D firmware (2.0.3). The microdrive is exceedingly SLOW when compared with the Hitachi 4GB microdrive. I had to send the microdrive back to Seagate (at my expense) to be sent another microdive with same OLD (3.01) firmware. If you have the Canon 20D with the 2.0.3 firmware install, you will need Seagate microdrive with the 3.02 firmware. Please take note of this. I'm waiting to get problem resolved with Seagate, and I refuse to pay for shipment a second time on THEIR mistake. Come on SEAGATE, get with the program and support your customers."
5,YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!,"This toy is totally awsome. I would pay any price for it. Even though it's vicious, it is cool. But you should buy this version and not the original version. This thing changes color by the direction you look at it. It can be 2 colors at one time too. BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,More Scooby Snacks!!,"Season 3 was funnier,and more entertianing then the Movie, Scooby Doo Monsters Unleashed. Good old fashion Scooby Doo with a modern twist."
4,"Some good episodes, but poor DVD planning - the episode list doesn't match the discs!","I'm happy to have some of my favorite episodes, like ""The Tar Monster"" and ""A Highland Fling with a Monstrous Thing."" The ""Highland"" episode had some great lines, especially the exchange with the innkeeper as they're looking for Castle McDuff - ""But a warn ye - dinna go! Stay away from the Castle McDuff."" And I warn you - don't trust the episode list - Episode 11 - ""The Diabolical Disc Demon"" is not at the end of Disc 2, Side A. Instead it kicks off Disc 2, Side B! How did that get past quality control?"
5,classic capers,This dvd is great.The 2 discs it contains are as entertaining as well organized.it contains the legendary 16 scooby doo episodes 1.watch out!the willawaw2.creepy tangle in the bermuda triangle3.a scary night with a snow beast fright4.to switch a witch5.the tar monster6.a highland fling with a monstrous thing7.the creepy case of old iron face8.jeepers it's the jaguaro9.make a beeline away from that feline10.the creepy creature of vulture's claw11.the diabolical disc demon12.scooby's chinese fortune kooky caper13.a menace in venice14.don't go near the fortress of fear15.the warlock of wimbledon16.the beast is awake in bottomless lakeTHE SPECIAL FEATURES ARE:1.hanna barbera from H-B2.trailersI hope you enjoy this dvd.I CERTANLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY SCOOBY DOO FAN.
2,Frederica is Like a Reader's Digest Condensed Book,You'll never be in danger of getting too deeply involved with the characters or plot.It lacks depth or surprise.
1,DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT!!!!!!!!!,TERRIBLE! I played a few levels and it is absolutely terrible! I think the only good James Bond game i ever played was goldeneye but even that got old but this gets old from the first gun shot. terrible controls. I won't buy this game unless it's...on sale forget about this!
4,Agent Under Fire,"I have played 7 missions on this game and consider it to be top class. Compared to the last game I played rated at 9.6 out of ten, it's definately been more fun!Sure the game is short but delivers full-on action and variety, which more than compensates for this. Gameplay and graphics are exellent! I wonder what EA will do for an encore?"
2,What happened?????,"No where near as fun and addicting as golden eye was. Multiplayer battles are a joke, levels are way to small. When you beat the game in a matter of days, you are left wondering if you really beat it, no ending, credits or anything. The only thing I liked was the new driving levels. At first it seemed like a good game but really fell short in the end. Sorry Jeff."
3,To be or not to be... that is the question.,"Rating based on 5 hours of gameplay...I have found that this game is very hard to control with using all of the buttons on the GC Gamepad. Every single one of the joysticks, d-pad, and buttons are used on this game and boy does it get IRRITATING and FRUSTRATING!!! For the first 2 hours, I spend most of the time learning the controls. On the final three hours, that's where the gameplay actually started. The graphics are incredible clean, but where's the realism? I have never seen a game without blood [making the game realistic]. I believe that they could have spend another month or so to make this game more realistic.Game Play: 4.5Graphics: 5Story: 4Controls: 3Overall: 4.125- CrashTeknik [GC Gamer]"
3,Average,"First let me start off by stating That ever since I Had a N64 I have had First person shooters such as Golden Eye 007 and Perfect dark. ANd let me also state That This game does not even come close to perfect Dark. The weapons are Not unique and the Multiplayer is just downright boring. However the single player mode is not bad. I will even go as far as to say that it is quite refreshing, especially the levels where driving is nessasary. For all you Perfect Dark and Golden eye 007 fans dont expect much from this game. You might consider renting this game before you use your hard earned money to buy it."
3,OK if you like Bond,This game was alright. it was the best i had played till i thouched halo 1. but like i said if you like Bond then an overall good game to play for gamecube.......
2,Puppet theater poorly made,"We bought this puppet theater last summer for my granddaughter's birthday. It was fine at first, but when we tried to move it from the playroom to family room a few months ago, the main bar at the top broke in two. Since then all the knobs have come off and finally it just was unusable. For the nearly [...]price tag, I feel it was not worth the money. It is made of thin wood and not durable. My granddaughter is not [...] her toys and this one was very disappointing. Being made of wood, it should have lasted longer than this. Just heard from Kaplan Learning Co. and they are offering me a full refund."
1,Aluminum notebook laptop case,"Worse case I have ever seen. All the corners were chipped and after settingthe combination, per the instructions, I could not unlock the case. Sad to sayI had to destroy the case to get my stuff out. Do not buy this case. You get what you pay for."
4,It's ok,"If you want to play Bon Jovi music of his new album its very good but there are some little missing parts of the songs, don't worry they are insignificant. Generaylly it worth."
5,review,arrived in better shape than described. arrived on time and quickly. Item is better quality than that described at the time of purchase.
2,An Unexpected Disappointment,"Well I /was/ originally looking greatly forward to this book. I had been a fan of the ""... for Dummies"" books for a while now. Unfortunately I found this one to be a disappointment. Although I can appreciate having sections on good web page design, I felt it was too much to wait until chapter 4 to code your first page. Plus, there's just too much design-based content in the book overall, and not enough of actual HTML tag-based exercises.The examples on the CD ROM are awful. They really don't give any good insight as to how the tags work. Plus, many of the example files are identical. For example, TFOOT.HTM, THEAD.HTM and TR.HTM are the exact same file. That's just inexcusably lazy. How hard could it have been to exhibit some of the attributes of those tags?I give it two stars because if you already know HTML, it can be a pretty useful reference. Also, the troubleshooting chapter (chapter 16) was pretty good."
4,"Good graphics, storyline/sound/music..etc.",Good graphisc and storyline and all......but gameplay is hard!!!But very impressive game and I reccomend it for simulation fans!!!!
1,if you don't have it don't buy it,i bought this game only to find out it won't run on my machine .and if it won't run on mine there is something really wrong .i have and amd xp 2100 1733 mhz 1 gig of pc 2700 333mhz ram a nvida geforce 4 mx 440 video card sound blaster live gamer sound card.like i said before if it won't run on this machine it won't run on anything.
2,doesn't live upto the standard,Graphic's were ok.Didn't like how they changed the keystrokes nor the fact that you have to shoot another mech 200 times to kill them..Shoot a leg off & it's still there..What gives with that?Another bothersome thing about this game are all those video's you can't bypass..On all the rest of the games just hit esc & the video stop's & you can enter into battle.But not on this game.You must endure all the [game] video's.I've played all the Mechwarrior games & this is as disapointing as Heavy Gear was.Even was a member of Clan Wolf on the old Mplayer.com mech2 online gaming site.I'm just hoping Mech4 Mercs won't be like this one is. It's too bad I can't play my Mech2 & Mech2 merc's anymore due to my O/S..It just won't play DOS based games.
3,"Film School Light, Won't Run On 64-Bit Computer","I tend to agree with a previous reviewer who said this was a little light on information. The concept is a good one---a computer-based, interactive film school, but the information and interactive activities are on the light side. It would be nice to see the author do a more current version and perhaps go into a little more depth. There is a short movie that they produced and they use that movie as a tutorial for certain concepts, including a lesson on editing, that was helpful. There are some good tidbits of information in here, but not a film-school's worth. Also know that this will not run on a 64-bit computer, so eventually, this DVD will go the way of a VHS tape."
4,remarkable binoculars,"These binoculars are truly remarkable in their clear picture and wide range.They do not need focusing for someone with normal vision, but I wish it were possible to focus so I could take my glasses off to enjoy the complete view.They are a bit bulky in width, but their short length is nice."
1,All Quicken / QuickBooks products are a scam … use any other product if you can as Intuit has us all held hostage,"If I could, I'd run away from any Intuit product as fast I possibly can. Unfortunately, Intuit has us all held hostage to their mediocre product and forced upgrades. Do yourself a favor and try to use any other product except QuickBooks."
4,SO MUCH FUN!!,"My [former] friend HAD one in blue..We spent long summer days playing on this toy!! And it was so much fun! But eventually it wore out and now theres a big hole in it. I think it has cause a whole bunch of people jumped on it at once (remember, 2 at a time!!) so much fun, but doesn't last long."
5,Loved it,"I'm a Leslie Sansone Fan, so this was one to add to my collection even though Leslie's exercise is based on 4 basic steps I love having a variety of her video's because of the different people and places she does them. Some do complain about Leslie's talking to much during her exercise, but I find what she says as health education she not just directing excercise. Thank You"
4,Peggy Lee at her best,"Although the CD does not have all my favorite songs with the exception of Sweet Happy Life, is not bad-Good rhythm and style."
3,Good Set,"I received this set as a gift about two years ago, and am still pretty satisfied with it. However, the AC Adaptor stopped working after about 8 months. I got a new adaptor, and that didn't help. It turns out that the input jack for the adaptor came loose after 8 months of being jolted around every time the pads are struck. Luckily, it does come with a space for battery back-up, so you can put in six AAs and it will work.WORD OF WARNING, HOWEVER; the batteries run out very quickly, even with top-of-the-line batteries. But, overall, it's not a bad item."
2,Too frustrating for younger children,"I bought this as a gift for a 5-year old, who is quite accomplished through many levels at several other Game Boy games (Donkey Kong, Pac Man, etc.) He was far more frustrated with this than any other game. The Game Boy game direction control is not adequate. Ideally, a slower marble speed as a training or beginner level may help (although I recognize the game gives unlimited lives within the alotted time and real marbles have one speed on a given slope). It is a difficult game best suited for older, accomplished gamers."
2,Marble (not-so-fun)ness,"The game I've played is not for color, rather the older version.But, it cant be much different.Basicaly, you roll a marble around in a ""maze"" - well, its not a maze, more you move it around obstacles. The fun part of the game is where you roll you marble in front of a ""wave"" that carries you, but if you dont get off of it, the marble falls and you have to start again (from where it fell)Overall, I felt the game was okay for a hour or less, but it gets boring after a while. There are more worthwile things to spend your money on."
2,Disgusting and Immoral!,"As someone who was spanked as a child, I a somewhatuncertain of its effectiveness - but of one thing I am certain - to take a child's (or teenager's) pants down is allways disgusting and immoral. Even for those that insist on spanking should never ever do it on on the bare - bottom. (It is painful enough even while wearing pants!) That is why this book is disgusting. I gave it two stars because it does have some legitimate points regarding spanking."
1,I question what bible this man reads,"It might be ""the torture bible"". This is a perfect example of people using Christianity as an outlet to abuse and control others."
1,Human rights abuse,Why does Amazon sell this trash that advocates violence and abuse of children? What does it take to get out of this cycle of getting beaten and becoming an abuser? Why are people so blind to this travesty of parental care? Nothing Christian about anyone who beats their own precious children. Roy Lessin's book should die fast.
1,They're out there!!!,"The sicko's are out there!!! Watch out...they're kids will be loose some day...- Mom of 5 well-behaved, non-assaulted children"
5,Luv=Britneys Dance Beat,"Wow! That is just one word to describe this game, when i found out that i got to play this game before it even came out i almost passed out! I played the greatest game ever, the graphics r awsome and u get to see britney perform like crazy! If i could i would give it 100 *s but 5 is the highest."
1,really bad,I didn't like this game because it was really boring and it just didn't interest me at all. And i don't recommend this to other people.
1,WHUT?!,"It is very hard to find a video game these days that simply does not have any value whatsoever. Even in the most brainless game there is something that makes it worthwhile at least as a paperweight (Harry Potter for example). Alas, Britney's Dance Beat would not even qualify as a frisbee. WHO IN THE WORLD THOUGHT OF THIS #(*&^!. Games that use celebreties' are bad enought (so-and-so's something-or-other), but this is ridiculous. Is Britney such a bad singer that she has to sell herself to gaming companies (I'd say yes)?JUST SAY NO!"
4,on behalf of my daughter,"This was the first game my daughter played on her new PSII. When we first opened the game I thought ""how boring"". My husband was sure it had to be played with a dance mat since we just didn't undertand the point to hitting the button to dance. My daughter played it for about 1/2 hour until she also became bored. BUT, when a friend came over and she found out she could compete - we couldn't get her to stop playing.Fantastic game for a first time user under 7 years old. This game taught my daughter how to handle the controles which aloud her to transition to a more difficult game.Might be a better rental..."
5,Britney Rocks!,I played through this game and it's lots of fun. if you can get through all the auditions not only you get to see a CGI Britney dancing but you also get to see what it looks like running a camera at her concerts. But one downfall you can't zoom in to get closeup shots of her but it's still rather cool!
3,One for the kids... (not one for the experts),"I have 2 main criticisms of this game:1. bad rhythm - unlike other dancing games, the timing of the key presses in this game are out of sync with the music most of the time. The best way to play this is by sight. VERY UNprofessional.2. too easy. i fail miserably when playing play DDR, but finished this one in half an hour. would be great for younger kids. if you've played dancing games before dont even bother.Most of the videos are boring too, till u get to the last few. Lots of britney though. Worth a look if you are a huge fan, especially the younger ones."
4,Good for price,It's hard to find a decent magazine rack for a reasonable price and this works perfectly. The picture is how it looks in person and it holds a good amount of magazines. The only negative is that the tassels are made of metal which makes it look a little cheap.
1,Beware! Flawed Copy!,"The quality of this DVD makes me wonder if the makers are selling a pirated copy as new. The video and audio quality are terrible and they actually left in the message to wait while they changed reels. After the change the quality actually dropped further, being greatly out of synch."
1,"Bad, probably illegal reproduction","I made the mistake of ordering this for my wife for Christmas as she had it on her wish list. Neither she or I had bothered to look at the reviews. It's as bad as others have said. I think someone copied this originally from film to VHS, and then to DVD. Either the first, or both copies were done by someone without the right knowledge and equipment, which leads me to believe this is probably an unauthorized copy, which should not be selling to the public.I enjoyed the story, and I think it was a nice trip back in time for my wife, but it was hard to deal with the poor quality, especially at the end."
3,Everything but the train,"We liked everything about this except for the train project. The magnets need to be aligned perfectly and the plastic guides are too short. The guides should keep the train from moving sideways or rolling over. But the magnetic force is so strong that the train rides high next to the guides, such that the plastic only touches the bottom part. We had to modify the set with add-on pieces to make the thing work...and it only worked sub-par."
2,not worth the money,I thinki this is a good idea with alot to learn from it but very poor design. Not completely accurate peices and hard to get it all to work when the peices are not all the same. Had to do alot of extra work that the directions did not give. (extra tape on the rails to keep straight) Hard to keep train from derailing otherwise.
4,Is there no end to your measuring?,"I have used 60"" measuring tapes. They are fine for what they do. But sometimes you need more. Perhaps 62"". Perchance, 75"". In furtive moments, 98.5"". Sometimes you feel like going crazy and measuring something that busts past that two-digit inch barrier into something truly lengthy.For such moments, a mere 60"" tape measure simply will not do. Have you ever sworn you wouldn't touch something with a ten-foot pole? How would you know? Now, with the 120"" yellow fiberglass tape measure - you can! 120 muscular inches of pure measuring power. That's like ten school-year measuring rulers, matched with the flexibility of finely-crafted fiberglass.Need to make a pair of pants for a sumo wrestler? There's a tape for that.Thank you, Fiberglass Tape Measure - 120"" Yellow. You are my passport to a new world of measurement."
1,good and bad,"A relatively interesting story, but I must admit the initial chapter or 2 is so profanity laden that my wife has told me that this book must leave the house after I finish. Fortunately the language does improve considerably later in the book. I am surely in the minority, but I don't see why authors have to remind us that some junior high/high school kids curse. In this case ""realism"" tries to overshadow the literary benefits."
1,Slow Speed No Port Forwarding,You cannot change any settings on this modem. It's NAT type is automatically Moderate. Do not use this for gaming. Do not use this modem. ATT tech made me pay $60 for this useless light box. I'm giving ATT a call ASAP and asking for a replacement.
2,Tailbone protection: Fail,"I purchased these padded shorts for an upcoming snowboarding trip. I tried them on and was really disappointed with the lack of tailbone protection, in fact I think the padding would cause more of an injury then without padding because it causes additional pressure. The padding narrows in the tailbone area and easily rides up or over resulting in no protection where you need it. Instead I returned the shorts for the AZZPAD which worked great."
3,Good book,"I like this book and use it in my classroom, wish there was more to it and explination. It's minimal information but works."
1,not what I ordered,I ordered the rosemarie 10.5 size plate and got a 8.5 wrong pattern plate that I have to sent back and I still have no plate.
3,I got two words for ya... I forgot what they where,"This was the much awaited sequel to WARZONE and I couldnt wait for this one to be released. But when it was, I found myself rather disapointed with a few things. Tho the graphics where better, the music was real and not midi, and there was a s*** load more wrestlers to choose from. There was so much effor put into the charactors that ACCLIAM completly ignored the fun factor, it was more fun in Warzone then in this one. They concentrated all there time on the charactor development and forgot to do anything about the crowed. There needed to be more then a dull arena that looked nothing like a WWF set.. well, maybe a house show in the 1970's but not the way it should have looked. Everything was too programmed and hard to watch sometimes. THQ had a breath of fresh air with REVENGE, but greatly imprvoed to the best WWF game on the 64 with there last one NO MERCY."
5,WWF ATTITUDE,"The Rock says don't be a jabroni,you should by this game. Probably the best, hottest, coolest wrestling game for the Nintendo 64. Over 40 wrestlers!!!! WWF Attitude 3:16!!!!"
1,Robots wrestling and no referee!,This game in't worth your money. I got bored very quickly. The moves are way too complicated and u really don't feel like you're in THE GAME. The wrestlers move like robots. Everything looks repetitive after 3 minutes of play. Did they rushed to put this game on sale and forgot to put a referee in it?
5,Everything Anne,"This is one of the most outstanding annotated editions of a book I have ever seen. It is packed with interesting, relevant annotations about the world of Anne of Green Gables, as well as LM Montgomery's own life and Prince Edward Island itself.Due to the nature of the writing in Anne of Green Gables, an annotated edition is especially welcome to fill in the blanks on Canadian politics (What is a ""grit?"") and social conventions at the time. Reading the annotations increases the pleasure of entering the Anne's world, and that is incredibly important.Also, of special note and appreciation, many of Anne's favorite obscure poems and readers are included in the back. Finally, you are able to get the whole version of the many quotes that she drops, and see just where she picked up her big words.The best gift you could get for a true fan of Anne of Green Gables."
4,No switch.,"I found installation a bit difficult because of the bulkiness of the actuators. The space between my door panel and the window carriage was to small so I had to install the actuator at the bottom of the door to the outside locking rods, which caused a longer run of the actuator rod than I desired. I installed them in a 1993 2 door Jeep Wrangler 6cyl. They are strong enough to push all the parts of the lock very well. I do wish, though, that this kit came with switches for locking and unlocking. As the kit is now, it is set up to automatically lock and unlock the doors only when the key is turned, or the inside manual lock is pressed. But it does have the option for a switch. It is a perfect kit for the basics. A few extra dollars at radio shack for some switches makes this kit wonderful. I think it will last a long time, if not they are very cheap to replace."
4,A weird but classic match,"I don't know about the other review (I'm assuming that the previous review is for halloween havoc 91, THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS) but this video is similiar to it. Jim Ross again does the play by play, and the main event is a THUNDER CAGE MATCH. The participants are sting, Ric Flair, The great MUTA, and The former heavyweight champ (at that time) Terry Funk. WCW had the reputation of using thunder cages instead of the usual steal fences (the one that your neighbor has in his yard.) Special guess Referee was used. The top of cage was slanted inward w/ lots of electricity. (You can figure the point in that) IF you buy this, you will enjoy the grudge match between doom and steiners, Road warriors vs skyscrapers (sid vicious and Spivey) and luger vs the late Flyin Bryan. By the way, you will note that the event took place in the philadelphia spectrum."
4,My First Lathe,"At age 74, I finally broke down and purchased my first lathe, the Grizzly H2669 Hobby Lathe.This lathe is not fancy, but is functional and priced for those strapped for a generous amount of cash - like me.My first project was to shape a nosecone for a small model aircraft. Turned out great!Tony Beckman"
2,Mediocre Option,"At best, this device will help aerate a lawn that is in good shape. If the ground is too hard, the device will not penetrate - at least not without adding so much weight that it can't be moved safely. If the ground is too soft, it becomes difficult to roll it.Rent an aerator."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this. They didn't even put enough thought into it as to have a standard cinder block fit on it. You will be breaking one up to make it fit, or find yourself at the hardware store looking for smaller ones to fit the platform. Even then, it doesn't seem to really dig into the ground well, even after watering. This is probably because it's more of a rolling motion than a downward motion. Sounds like a good idea, but not when it's put into practice."
1,agri-fab,We found that this product does not do what it claims to do. All it does is poke holes in the ground and does not do enough to really aerate the lawn. Very disappointed in it!
2,Aerator,Not too an effective product. Doesn't work well if the ground is hard and takes a lot of effort even if the ground is workable.
2,AGRI-FAB,"The product was on the ""flimsy side"" and did not work well on my lawn. I called the company because I had two washers left over and the assembly instructions are not very good. The two washers were ""extras"", but they do not tell you this in the instructions! The spikes are loose. The company said I should use the two washers to tightn it. I would say save your money."
1,Ugh! Good Luck,"Wow, in the picture I thought this looked pretty good to aeriate our lawn. Without wheels this contraption is a bear to push - and you have to have the brick on it or the spikes just sit on top of the grass. Our yard has some dips and minor hills and using this was a back breaker (handle doesn't come up very high)as well as getting ""stuck"" anytime the lawn wasn't perfectly even. I would not recommend."
5,Entertaining change of pace,"I'm not the best at hand-eye coordination, and my reflexes are a lot slower than my teenage son's, but I liked Pinball of the Dead. Similar to a basic pinball game, with variables from wandering zombies, ghouls, and demons who are both targets and sources of interference. My only complaint is it should have a control on screen brightness. It's a little too dark to play anywhere but a well lit area. I don't know if the new back-lit GBA would help."
5,KILLER GAME,This is the most long lasting fun on GBA ever. Lots of variations and it's got all the same bad guys you love from the Arcade House of the Dead 2. Destined to be a classic.
1,Stopped Reading...,I have heard alot of positive things about this book though I think I needed something a little less in depth that I could follow a little easier.
1,Terrible in it's horribleness,"This is quite simply the worst game I have ever seen for the Gameboy color platform. NFL Blitz is an excellent game for pretty much everything but the Gameboy. The colors are poorly done and the gameplay is just plain bad. Plays don't work properly, the game moves so fast that it's almost impossible to tell what's going on, and the views on the game don't give you the classic football feel. Do not buy this game, I guarantee you will be disappointed."
4,Awsome,"This game is really cool. It has good graphics for Game Boy but you can't see the hard hits like on N64. I played Madden 2000 also and Blitz is a much better game. If you want a football game for Game Boy, this one is for you."
2,4 short levels,This game is very short. It is very fun for the short time. This is a good rental that is fun for the weekend but it is not long enough for a purchase. I beat this game in 1 HOUR after I rented it. The graphics are fantastic and it is worth playing but not buying.
4,REVENGE IS SUCCESSFUL,"Star wars: Racer Revenge is definatly a success. I had the first one for Nintindo 64 and throughly injoyed it. This next edition to the series carries on the enjoyment factor. The only shot fall is the two player game play, it is still fun to play but the limited view that you get with two player makes this game much more fun as a one player game. Never-the-less it is still a very good game and I would recomend it to any one who likes a fast paced racing game."
4,Calming Pastime,This is a great way to still the mind and pass some time. Easy to use and lots of designs
1,This program sucks,"This program was sent to me without a registration number and i had to call to get it. When they sent it, the program fail to download and when we tried again it refuse to do so. Tried to contact the company again no answer going to send it back will never buy from them again the soft ware is to diffilcult to use and not enough input from the software maker."
3,For fans of Giordano,"This book is basically a carbon copy of all such how-to-draw-comics books. You get the same basic pages, not showing you so much how to actually draw a hand or head, but instead more-or-less finished drawings useful only to someone who already knows how to draw. So fairly useless if you're not an artist trying to learn some new ways to frame a shot or change a perspective. I bought this only because I'm a Giordana fan. I was pleased with about a third of the images here, the rest didn't do much for me. For the price, however, it was a good buy and worth having in my collection."
4,They rock,Just wanted to say very awesome relaxing music. I got to listen to some of the tracks that are currently being worked on for the next album. They arent near finished but sound very nice already
5,Futuristic and Different...,"I thought this CD was great. To me, its the melody thats addictive. I first saw the video and heard ""Never the Same"" on MTV2 one night and I knew I had to get their CD. It has been about two months since I bought this CD and I still haven't gotten tired of the songs."
1,No Change,I used the whole tube and could not tell a difference in the eye & mouth fine lines. I would not buy again.
1,broke out a ton!! :(,TERRIBLE!!!! I've never broke out like this before!!!! :/ so upset. Would NEVER recommend!! Threw the product away. So disappointing. Wasted money :(
5,Perfect,Not greasy and very soothing. No smell. Fades darker spots too. Nice product and great price. Does help get rid of wrinkles.
1,From $900 to $275 is the reason!!!!!,"These are the same 2 sellers I saw 2 months ago selling this Xbox for $900. I check now and it is only $275!!!! I can see why it is one third of the price. It is ugly, and it says Mountain Dew on it. Who would want something that says Mountain Dew on it instead of Xbox? Also, for any of you who thought it was a 360, it is not. Mountain Dew gave these units away for free when they had the ""look under you cap thing""!! It is worth 1 cent. It comes with a black S controller. Shouldn't it come with a green controller to match it? Do NOT NOT NOT buy it!!!!!!"
3,"Good Cool Fun, But not a classic","I bought this game when it dropped in price. I had to have one more item with the SLC Olympic Logo on it, I was a volunteer during these games. The game has a good representation of some of the sports played, graphics where decent but not memorable. I think it would be a great sports title for someone who has never played one, young or old. For the hardcore fan, I would maybe pick this up only if you have pride for TEAM USA!!! But for the rest of us it had the thrill to keep me jumping off that K-120 hill for a couple of days."
5,Great product,"Used this for my 32"" Vizio. The screws it came with (many) were either too short or too long for the Vizio. I just shortened the longer ones and it worked great. You can also just pick up right ones at a hardware store.The mount works great. Easy to adjust and it stays where you adjust it to, no sag.Perfect product at a great price."
2,The best is the title song at the end,"The introduction of this movie looks interesting: Several couples from different ages want to experience sex. The cast features sexy and beautiful girls. However, at the middle of the picture, gets bored as they talked and talked with no action at all. Nothing happens, and at the end, leaves uncertain: What this movie about?The best: the title song (sung at the end of the movie), and Carolina Cano (who played Alexa in this movie)."
2,Blah!!!!,"This deals with four Peruvian couples dealing with sexual matters. The problem is that it's not very sexy at all. It's boring too.I love the age and gender diversity here. However, this movie only uses European-phenotyped actors. I hear that Peru is full of brown people of Inca and other indigenous descent. This lack of ethnic diversity frustrated me greatly.""The Big Chill,"" ""Parenthood,"" ""The Woman's Guide to Adultery,"" and countless other films have ensemble casts dealing with everyone's favorite topic. And they all do it better than this work.Don't get me wrong: I didn't hate this work. It was just mediocre in so many ways."
4,Great recovery,"Although the wrong blades were originally sent, they sent the correct ones as soon as I reported the problem and everything was great. - no hassle at all.Thanks!"
2,There are better books for this.,"I was fairly disappointed in this book. As an impatient decorator, I was hoping for a lot more visual ideas (and valuable tips). Most of the 201 shortcuts aren't really shortcuts at all, and more to the point, of the 201 there are probably only 2-3 real gems, the rest are wasted space. There are far better books for those who wish to improve their homes."
1,Sucks,This game is horrible you cant even fly around in this game your still on the ground in my opinone you get more air in tony hawk 3 far from a good game far from even a game my frien lent it to me for a week and i gave back the next day dont buy
4,Sweet!!!,"I am a survivalist, I am a learner and a teacher. I always like to advance my know how. I have learned alot in the military and in scouting. I find this book to be well informing and wearth the price. I also put a few to work and the key they don't say much about is the adjustments. The snares work well and so on. Try a few of the fishing it works to with modifications but they work well and it is good with time too.The book was and is fun to read and put to work."
3,My son's review,"Our son received this book for Christmas last year from my wife and I. I thought it detailed, but he thought is less so."
5,Got it for hubby's Go Bag,"Well, when the Zombie Apocalypse happens, we will be well equipped to compete with house cats in the trapping of small game for food. I got him some small snares as well, so this should assure us of mouse stew, should things go horribly wrong.Seriously, he really liked this book and said it will be useful. We haven't tried trapping anything yet, but are now equipped to do so."
3,Could be better!,This book is useful. I believe the author should have spent more time dealing with snaring small game for survival food purposes.
2,"The Trapper's Bible: Traps, Snares & Pathguards",The title to this book is misleading. It is not a trapper's bible. May be a good first booklet on traps and snares but for the price I was expecting much more..
3,Could have been better,"While this book is ok with some pretty good traps I think it could have been better. Most of the traps in it a just variations of the spring snare. It does have many useful illustrations which help with explanations. At only 99 pages, it's a little short and kinda reflects what's lacking in the book. Not a bad read, just very short leaving you with a ""oh...is that it"" kinda feeling..."
1,Not much help,This book did not have much information that was of value to me. I was looking for something to help me get started snaring bobcats and coyotes and this just didn't have it.
3,ok,the book was ok I like this kind of stuff.as an out doors man I knew most of the traps in the book
1,Only works on a flat surface...a REALLY flat surface!,"This DVD player worked O.K. at first, but after storing in my laptop case for a few weeks, it stopped working right. I thought it was totally broken, but I found out it still worked only if I placed in on a flat surface. That sounds reasonable, except that most of my desk surface doesn't seem to be flat enough. It usually takes somewhere between 6 and 10 tries, moving the unit around, until it finds a good enough ""spot"" to start reading the disk. Weirdest thing I've ever seen! I can't carry around with my netbook, since it is so ridiculously finicky. I do not recommend."
2,They were Kung Fu Fighting,"""Goodbye Bruce Lee"" is a hilarious tribute to the late great action hero. Bruce Li, the Bruce Lee knock-off,stars as a Bruce Lee fan... this sounds postmodern! Why do the villains challenge him to a fight in the Pagoda of Death? Why do they hold his endlessly sighing,whining girlfriend captive? Because he's a Bruce Lee fan!Bruce Li gets to fight villains from all over the world, a tough-looking African,a Caucasian who grunts constantly (between his grunting&the; heroine's sighing,there's plenty of vocalizing in this movie) He gets to wear a funny yellow leisure suit/jumpsuit that's a fashion statement/cry for help. The fight scenes are laughably bad.Like the song ""They were kung fu fighting"",it's a cheesy novelty movie. Goodbye,Bruce Lee,you deserve better!"
1,"No fx, the usual problem","I don't understand why they do not fix this.... There is no fx, the audio is screwed... Unless you have a creative imagination find the episode elsewhere..."
3,Only for die-hard TNG fans or collectors,"Buy this only if you are a die-hard TNG fan looking to complete your collection. The episodes are not as interesting as those in seasons 3 - 7. You can tell the actors and writers did not quite have the characters down at this early stage. Is it just me or does it seem like Picard just shouts everything in this season? Anyways, better than most television shows, but not too good compared to other TNG seasons. If Riker is clean shaven or Tasha Yar is on the bridge, don't bother watching."
2,Keep the Cost Down,The idea of making a DVD of a season is great. But now that they are selling I noticed the prices are going up. I like these but not as much as over [dollars] for it. The industry needs to keep the price down ...
3,3 Stars for cost $$$$$,I spent a bundle on the various dvds. Given the disastrous state of the economy in 2012 (and dim outlook for 2013) I won't be buying these blue-rays any time soon!
1,Lackluster,"I've watched every episode in the TNG first season on DVD and just about every episode was poorly scripted and awkward, and some of the characters really sucked especially Tasha Yar and Wesley Crusher were very annoying, in just about every episode the story has always been uninteresting garbage, season one is very painful to watch. I'm an original series fan and I do like the TNG movies but TNG season one is horrible, don't buy. I haven't seen the later seasons yet, are they any good?I did try to give season one a chance but I just ended up throwing it away after I watched all the episodes."
4,Great family viewing,"We try, when possible, to watch movies as a family on Friday or Saturday evenings. Some times, however, time is tight and a two hour + movie just will run too late.The Star Trek series is perfect for these situations. With running times of 45 to 50 minutes, we can watch one or two episodes and enjoy intelligent viewing. While in the first season the group was finding themselves as an ensemble, the episodes serve as the history for the subsequent excellent seasons."
5,The cosby show for geeks...,"Like the title of my review says that is how I feel. St:tng is like a feel good cosby type of show for geeks... both have a loving family/crew and a problem which needs to get resolved and which always is within an episode or two. When I first heard of this DVD boxed set I couldn't wait. And even though many people say season 1 wasnt great, re-watch the episodes as I have done... you'll realize just how good they really were. Especially some of the early character development. Some other perks to this DVD are the sound in 5.1/although I would have loved to get my hands on a DTS version the 5.1 sounds is crisp and clear, and the bonus footage... over 20 hours to entertainment.Overall it's a great set to own... This is one tv show I can watch over again w/out the usual repeat boredom setting it. As always, enjoy."
5,With Pitfalls Still a Great Start,"With the video quality something to be better such as the close ups of the actors very grainy and dark, still the over all was good on my Sony TV. The first shows the beginings of a truly great series, with the actors still not knowing where and what the their caraters are going to be. To end this review Get This Collection!! you will not be disappointed."
4,Great overall - video quality iffy in places,"Overall, this was a great purchase. I have no regrets and am looking forward to the next sets coming out. The packaging is cool and the special segments on disc 7 are excellent. I am very glad to have these on DVD!The one complaint is that the video quality tends to be very shadowy and dark in places. So much so, that you can't clearly make out the image. It occasionally gets frustrating to the point of distraction. This is not a problem with every episode, but it comes up more than once. Bridge, Sickbay, Engineering scenes seem OK and well lit, but crew quarters and planet scenes are iffy.It's too bad the trailers, or previews for next week, weren't added to the DVD.But, all in all, very cool!!!!Now, let's hope DS9 is not too far behind!"
3,11001001,"Amazon has the title of this wrong. This is a pretty standard episode. On the plus side, the show's special effects are best at handling external views of the ships, and the scene where the Enterprise glides into the space station is really well done, and actually looks quite a bit ahead of its time.On the negative side... ""The Bynars""? Seriously? The idea for this species is great, but their name is ridiculous. I'm sure to them it is completely normal that they communicate in a language similar to binary code, and I doubt that they would name their species after what is to them a mundane aspect of themselves (and I highly doubt that, if they did, their word for it would be so similar to the English word)."
5,Star Trek the next generation first season,I had watched these on tv when I was younger and just had to have them. A great product.
4,Oh this should be good!!!,"I must admit that Gary Sagle is a person after my own heart, as we are apparently the only 2 humans alive that really liked DS9. I'd be unbeveliably happy if DS9's seasons were released on DVD. At any rate, I was only 8 when the show premiered so I missed the majority of the first season (DS9 and Odo made me a Trek junkie) and I'm waiting for my chance to catch up on one of the best Sci-Fi series ever! Now, if only the other 6 seasons come out as quickly (along with the Simpsons seasons)."
4,"Poor Picture Quality on the First Season , STNG","As a Trekkie fan, I had eagerly anticipated this New Release.Paramount seemed to be doing everything right with STNG, after listening to Fans' complaints about the Original series... we get double the number of episodes per DVD and economy by buying the whole set... hurrah !My disappointment is the Picture QualityCOMPARE the picture quality with other DVD's you own (or even with the Original Series).... the picture quality of my STNG episodes looks like overly compressed .JPG images.... after taking so much care to ENHANCE the Original Series... why are we now sacrificing quality for quantity ?Was it necessary to use THAT much compression to get 4 episodes on a DVD or is there another reason ?I hope others will comment on this post... because I wanted to get ALL the seasons but I am really disappointed with the picture quality of this first batch... which I had been expecting would have been BETTER than the Original Series and certainly not worse !"
4,they coulda found a better print,"Of all the Star Treks, the Next Generation is my favorite. That's why I bought the First Season dvd set, even though I already have the entire series on tape. I was quite disappointed that Paramount was using the same quality film that is seen on cable networks. The dvd's have a slight pinkish-purplish hue and are dark in scenes where I know they were much brighter, cause the tapes I have are the ones I did myself from the very first airing of each episode.I sincerely hope that the subsequent seasons are using better quality film, or I and many others are going to feel pretty stupid shelling out another hundred bucks.And the only reason I gave it as many stars as i did, was twofold.The packaging is wonderful and it's out of respect for the terrific actors who worked on the show and gave us such joy for seven years and a bunch of movies."
1,Missing SoundTrack for weapons,I don't think its worth watching any more after what has been done to this episode. Within minutes of the start of the episode you will notice no sound for the Guns or Photon torpedoes. Stopped watching after that. It took alot away from the enjoyment of the show.
3,When the Bough Breaks,"This is a pretty unmemorable episode. It works well, especially in the beginning, with the notion of an entire planet being cloaked, and the impressive technology within. Once the children are abducted, it starts getting kind of boring, though."
3,The Big Good-Bye,"TNG has a whole slew of episodes where the holodeck does weird stuff, beginning with this one. In way, it's like a character development episode, where the character is The Holodeck (or perhaps The Enterprise). It's a pretty solid episode, nothing really outstanding but at the same time there's really nothing bad about the episode either."
3,It's ok,"The production was a little stiff the first few seasons. Maybe it was chemistry issue, or maybe they just hired better staff later"
1,Unskippable Trailers,"Disc 1 starts out with a several minute-long, unskippable trailer for Season 2. So if you like sitting through that every single time you want to watch an episode, this is the set for you. If you rather want to watch the episodes without being treated badly, then prepare to read up on ripping BluRay disks."
5,A visionary parable,"The Generosity Factor is a pick for both spirituality and self-help collections, offering insights into generosity and how it's a visionary parable for any seeking more to life than they already have. Using the parable of several self-made people, they provide five key principles to using generosity to achieve a more meaningful life."
3,OK I guess.,"Naruto Clash of Ninja is, the american version of the ever popular Naruto Genkito Ninja Taiesen of which I have all. If it is anything like the Japanese version It will be an adventure that covers about the first 30 episodes of the anime, It also will have a 2 player verses mode. Personally the only reason I bought this game was to play as Zabuza and aku because they are not in any of the other games. If you don't mind not playing as those two than wait for naruto clash of ninja 2 which has a much better story and 4player melee combat and of a ton of new characters."
3,Worth the price,"This is a terrible game. I knew that when purchasing though, so my purchase satisfied my wants. Yes it does indeed."
3,For gamers,"For those that are trying to find gamecube games online, this is one that you should try. I like it, but the only bad thing is that you can only play about 7 different characters. of course this is one the few original games for naruto, so this is one to collect if you like naruto."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this machine few months ago. Wish I could give it 0 star or a negative ratingThe taller jar doesn't work, in the sense that, whenever I try to grind something in it, the rubber part breaks to pieces. This happens every single time!!The outer shell of the medium size jar has already cracked, The blades are touching the bottom of the jar.It is just a overpriced piece of junk."
2,Nothing New,"Pretty much a retread of numerous low budget horror flicks--the kind you used to see at drive-ins. The acting is pretty poor, the story line is worse, the interest factor is almost non existent. To top it all off the description on the dvd cover is almost totally wrong--making me think either the person who wrote it 1. Didn't actually watch it or 2. Was so bored they forgot what they watched or 3. Figured nobody would actually noticeExamples-""His lab is invaded by criminals intent on stealing a new vaccine""--actually one criminal who is supposedly a research volunteer is brought to the lab-where he manages to escape.""When Bowman's attackers inject him with the experimental serum they unleash a horrifying transformation""--not quite right, while escaping the criminal causes an explosion which transforms himself into the mosquito man.I'd have to recommend avoiding this clunker--unless you're in a mood for some Ed Wood type entertainment (not nearly as funny though)"
2,Nice design - but fabric not soft,"This is such a cute design, but when I got the actual set, I was disappointed with the quality of the sheets...they did say they were a poly/cotton blend, but they are not that soft. It got better once we washed the sheet, but had I known, I would not have ordered this set since my kid likes soft material."
2,Hard to play and boring,"My 5 kids under the age of 10 say it's an alright game but not easy play and gets boring and not what they expected in purchasing. Win some, lose some."
3,grand-sons game,My grand-son did not like the game he said it was to hard for him so we sold it at a yard sale.
4,The life and history of the magic and evolution of Galapagos in Hi-Def defines beauty,"In my opinion the Galapagos Islands are the most beautiful and the most pivotal islands in the world that supports Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the Origin of Species. It's elegance and strangeness separate these islands more than anywhere in the world. You'll see lava fields, shores and beaches, sea lions, blue-footed boobies, and the albatross and much much more.The documentary is in three parts, 'Born Of Fire', 'Islands That Changed The World' and 'Forces Of Change'. Two and a half hours of splendor. Wonderfully narrated by Tilda Swinton. The animals, wildlife and beauty of the landscape is captured wonderfully in Hi-Def.I suggest this film to anyone who loves the nature of our world as well as the Theory Of Evolution."
5,Simply outstanding,"A group of us who are leaving in two days to dive in the Galapagos sat down to watch this last week and were just blown away. Not only is the photography as good as you'll find for a nature subject, the writing, narration and pace are all perfect as well. The story of what Charles Darwin saw and how the idea of evolution itself evolved in his mind is as fascinating as the implications of evolution, and this film captures all of that and more. When you put it all together, you realize you are looking at the earth at the dawn of life. The only thing better will be asctually to visit the islands."
5,"If you like Planet Earth, you wll love this one!",Eventhoguht is only 1 disk compare to 4 in planet earth. The disk is pack with nearl 2 and half hour of excellent Documentary about famouse island from Ecuador. I not gonna to reveal too much about the Documentary. Is really show why this island is so important to the species. It show them every aspect of life in all season of the years. You will love it. Just for inform is stereo sound not 5.1. No extras just like planet earth. But the video quality and the Documentary is really really all bout. price is a steal for under 20 dollars. If you can't afford planet earth and wanted to see outstanding HD quality for you tv. This is must !
5,Valentino Rossi !!!!!!!,"This has more racers then the first game, including Valentino Rossi !!! The best racer ever. It has more tracks too. The graphics are awsome. The realism of the game is perfect, the controls make it just like riding a real superbike. This is not some easy game where you can go flying into the turns, you have to break and downshift, and when you hit the apex of the turn... wide open throttle. 180 MPH!!!"
2,Hard for me to rate...,"Too bad there is no ""in-between"" the stars... I didn't hate this movie, but to say I liked it might be stretching it out a bit... Most of the acting was BAD, so bad that your feelings will probably be hurt. While I can appreciate one reviewer's enthusiasm for Chapa's use of Rio Grande Valle locals as bit parts, it sure took away from the film and actually gave it an unintentional humor. Everybody who took a bullet fell forward with a protective arm up! It was almost reminiscent of a 50s or 60s western where the actors took a bullet and just seemed to stiffen up.I respected Damian Chapa's work in ""Blood In, Blood Out,"" but I am having a hard time enjoying his subsequent movies. Even some of the Mexican DVDs in Wal-Mart's $5 bin have better acting and story lines... and I am NOT being sarcastic here. (Try ""Destino Mara"" and tell me if I'm wrong.)"
1,What??? Mexican-American-Nazi????,"The description of this movie made it sound far better than it actually was. The storyline was ridiculous (at best). There was no real character development or anything that made any of the characters likeable. It was disjointed and very predictable, with the main character spending most of the second half of the movie knocked out. I think it was supposed to be a drama, but my family found it to be too silly to try to take seriously. Save your money.... don't bother buying this one and think twice before renting."
2,"Chinese made, and everything that's come to mean...","In short, when you take the time to calibrate this unit, it seems ok, but it's very hard to calibrate, comes with illegible instructions that were written in Chinglish, and easily becomes uncalibrated (calibration screws are hard to fix in place)."
2,Fair children's book,"This is definately not the best children's book about Mackinac Island. The story is lacking and uneventful, and the illustrations are bland water color pictures. My children are preschoolers and have been to the Island often, but we much prefer ""Mac's Mackinac Island Adventure""."
2,"down & dirty, but not as good as the 2nd album","these guys drop some good lines on the EP, but the production kinda sounds like it came out of somebody's garage. I gotta say that the 2nd album AGUA PA LA GENTE is miles beyond!!! tastier beats and guitars!"
3,Knockout Kings 2002,"The graphics are decent, but could be better. Its fun for a while, then get boring, and like I said the graphics are not that good. Like the crowd looks [bad], and the graphics on the boxers are decent. There are some good boxers up there though. Dont buy it unless you really like boxing."
1,Big Dissapointment,"Despite the very good graphics, this game falls very short on game play. The character movement is some of the worst I have ever seen. Combine that with unrealistic knock-downs, no training, very few choices for customizing your boxer, and once again only being able defend your title 5 times before reitiring, and you get a big dissapointment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"I waited for a long time for this game to come out. I cannot believe how bad it is. NO body punches, NO training, they took everything fun out of this game and said they improved it....I could go on but belive me...it stinks. Read the reviews before you buy.Don't fall for the marketing hype...this game is bad."
2,Dull & Boring,"I had last year's knock out kings, and loved the aspect of the training mode. However, this game doesn't have that. Sure graphics are good, but the control was better on the last game...Anyhow, I'd advise to avoid this game. Let's see how outrageous the advertising will be. Don't be fooled!!!! Jason X"
5,Great cd and dvd,"This is for the person who threw away the second disc because it would not play, and threw it away. The second disc is a DVD. Just thought I'd let you know."
2,Feels like an arcade game to me...,"The graphics are sharp, except they seems a little carttony for the players. One big problem for me is the rather difficult fielding and even easier hitting--you'll have a 10 to 10 game by the second inning if you're not careful! And lastly, the game feels a little rushed, I'mrenting a version and it crashed on me 3 times :-( Not a good impression EA Sports, back tot he showers with this one!"
5,Great advice with good humor!,Great concept of delivering preventative medical advice with good humor! The cartoons and jokes were quite funny and the medical information offered is really valuable. Kudos to Dr. Syn for doing what he does with a great sense of humor!
4,encore! of who?,"Now unavailable. I must of had the last copy,how strange that this lovely double c.d. does not have any clue of who'ssinging. Just leading lights of broadway, thats just not good enough.some singers I can identify. but one number.... ridin'high I would love to have a clue......someone tell me PLEASE"
3,"Wow, crazy amount of grain in some scenes.","In one of the very first scenes on the first disc, the amount of bad grain on the bridge shots just blew me away. Not just ""grain"", but white grain on all the dark parts of the scene.My son and I watched season 1 in its entirety and saw nothing of the kind. Very disappointing.On the second episode, same thing on a couple scenes later on... but thank god it wasn't as much as episode 1 had.Did no one pop the disc into their Blu-Ray player and actually watch this before putting it on the store shelves??Also, the blue planet scene in episode 1 or 2 (don't remember which), it looked just awful. Now I have a 73"" TV, so I know details get blown up... but it was kinda pathetic looking in this case.Anyway, 3 stars. It's TNG, which I love, but god the quality control was just bad."
2,Poor picture quality,"Well i got the second season and it was worst than season one,Some scenes are sharp and clear and then the nest scene is very grainey almost unbearable,I dont know why they are not viewing these issues before mass production,The Star Trek series are a true treasure I dont know why they are outsoursing to fools very very sad."
2,Not Impressed,The quality on Season 2 is terrible. Picture is very grainy. Totally unworthy of a blu ray release. Some scenes are nice and sharp while others are so grainy it's unbearable. The only thing I enjoyed is the special features.
3,BLU-RAY VERSION PLEASE!,"PLEASE PUT ON THE BLU-RAY VERSION! If you do this, I will definitely join Amazon Prime!Season Two started to get better, especially with the introduction of Guinan and the Ten Forward lounge. I didn't like Dr. Pulaski as much as Dr. Crusher, though, and was glad when she came back in the Third Season."
5,"Good Product, Quality and Content","My Title says it all, this collection comes in a well designed box which my only complaint about it is that it may be a little difficult to get the disc box out of the external box. The quality of the DVD is fantastic, all the episodes look better than the first time I watched them on their original air dates with crisp sounds. If you have never seen Star Trek: TNG this is going to be a real treat for you. All of the episodes are memorable in their own way. A good investment!"
4,pretty happy with it,"I finally had to get a new printer after my HP 6L died on me.With the UBS cable it works fine, but I did get confused with the missing parellel cable port. There aren't any printed directions, so you need to install the CD to get any info.Very fast set up. Works well so far!"
1,Troubles with Windows XP SP2,"The printing preferences window contents does not fit into the visible window area. It looks like a driver compatibility problem with the new Windows XP Service Pack 2. I didn't install SP2 on my other computer, and the driver is working fine.The Email technical support was terrible. They suggested me to download a ""newer"" driver from the HP website. However, this so called ""newer"" driver is more than one year old (September 2003) and is identical as that coming with the installation cdrom. They also referred me to the driver installation web page which was not suitable for the USB printer installation.The printer itself is working fine. Also, I believe that they will update the driver some time in the future and the problem will go away.I'm giving this product a single star mainly because of the HP technical support incompetence and the bogus and outdated driver software."
5,Ridiculously effective,I have had this printer for 8 years and it is still working wonderfully. What an amazing product. I bought it refurbished from ebay too.
2,"Good Printer, BUT doesn't work with Vista","I loved this printer until I bought a new computer with Vista and it wouldn't recognize the printer. No driver at HP, no solution at this time. So it is disconnected. I am pretty disappointed in HP not having a suitable driver."
4,Good for light use - no windows 7 drivers,"PROS:Small footprint;relatively quiet;good quality printouts;uses the HP12A cartridge - this size cartridge is rated for 2000 pages vs HP successor cartridges for personal laser printers (eg, HP35A cartridge) which is rated for 1500 pages;Refurbished toner cartridges are widely available;CONS:No windows 7 drivers;compared to my previous printer (Samsung ML-2510), the 1012 prints a lot slower (especially noticeable with multi-page PDF documents)In conclusion, this is a good little printer for light/occasional use."
1,"You get what you pay for, thank god it was only 99 cents.","First off, the thought of this product being $19.99 is ridiculous! It's a damn good thing it was on sale for $0.99, or else I would definitely be returning this product. Basically its a piece of photo-quality paper with a print out of this image. The printout appears to be from a really crappy $10 printer with horrible image quality. The whole image is ridiculously pixelated.Like I said, its a damn good thing this product went on-sale for $0.99 or else this would definitely be returned, but for the cost its not even worth returning.A product I was hopefully going to be proudly displaying in my living room right above my TV, is now being displayed in the spare bedroom so I don't have to look at it everyday."
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter, to supplement her homeschool robotics curriculum. This was the 2nd robot kit she put together for the unit. There were a lot of small pieces, and she did have a small degree of difficulty in handling them, but anyone with experience putting models together should have no trouble.What she loved best was how FAST this model moves once it is complete. We put this together in two days - there are several steps so we did half one day and half another. I think total it took about 3 hours, which would have been too long for her to sustain attention on it.The only part we had real trouble with were the rubber caps that were to go over the battery wires. They just wouldn't stay on, so we used electrical tape instead.This is a cute toy and my daughter and I really enjoyed putting it together."
3,"Um, no ""Valium Ten""?!","This isn't completely a review for this disc, but rather an observation. I've owned a copy of the first Friends & Relations LP for decades and always go back to it for some of the songs that made it to this comp. But the ommission of ""Valium Ten"" is a sin. I hope it's available elsewhere for the sake of the loyalists - it is in fact one of the most off the hook, over the edge, balls to the floor best Hawkwind songs ever. Find it and crank it up!"
1,DAnger On Wheels,"The quality of this DVD was fair.It was particularly spoilt by Alpha Video's logo over the titles and taking up about 20% of the screen.The story is fine and interesting however.Hopefully better copies will become available on DVD-R on demand from the studios themselves.In the meantime, won't buy Alpha Video releases again."
3,fog delivers a decent album,"against my better judgment, i picked up the fog album. my reasoning was that maybe they just picked a bad single and that the rest of the album would be better. and it is. moving between bizarre guitar samples, leftfield beats, and lots of crazy sounds, fog creates a world of noise that appeals to both the indie and the leftfield crowd. pneumonia really was the only possible single from the album that can stand on its own, so i don't blame ninja tune for releasing that. however, the rest of the album seems to be so much better. fans of kid koala's scratch records and other leftfield bands will enjoy this romp through sound. it does require your full attention to appreciate it, and shouldn't be listened to at work, or while trying to concentrate on something else. a true listening piece."
4,Some Samba with that Jazz?,"The last CD I reviewed from Brazil turned out to be in our list as a top 10 CD for 2005. Sallaberry is a multi-talented musician who specializes in playing percussion. He surrounded himself with some pretty established, internationally renowned musicians over the last 3 years. His sound will remind you of Billy Cobham, Dave Weckl and Mike Stern, all whom he's worked with in the past, according to his website. His latest CD, ""SambaSong and Friends"" is a mix of Azymuth, Santana, Joe Satriani and Vital Information drummer Steve Smith, all rolled into one. Highlights of the CD included the track, ""Airflow"". I enjoyed the bossa nova and samba beat, a sound that is so well enshrined in Brazilian music. The track ""De Manha"" sound like an early Quincy Jones production, the song ""Velas"" comes to mind. Some listeners not familiar with the samba formula may be in for a little surprise. It's a very good listen! Recommended!"
1,Disappointing book,I bought this book looking for decorative concrete ideas. It has very little material on that subject and the ideas are tailored for ultra expensive houses making this book worthless for the average homeowner. Anyone who can afford the ideas in this book would have an interior decorator and thus wouldn't need it. I am returning the book
1,Not what I expected!,This looked nothing like the picture. I ordered them for my six year old son and when they arrived I was very disappointed. The army men were all in pieces and hooked together like all the legs toghether all arms on a seperate plastic sheet. They needed assembly. It was more like a project to put together the men not a toy for a six year old.
1,very unhappy,"Items are way too small and too many small pieces. Spent too much on this and did not give it to my grandson at Christmas, it's going to the Goodwill."
1,Stay Away!,"Deceptive listing--While BoxWave's listing says this Cradle is intended specifically for an 'Apple iPod nano(4 GB)'---it clearly did not work on my standard Apple 4GB iPod nano. When I complained (multiple times) to the BoxWave 'Customer Service??' Group, they were either non-responsive or said tough---'no refunds or exchanges' even though the product does not work on the exact iPod they listed as its target.My advice--Stay away!"
5,From the publisher...,"When trouble starts on a remote outpost, the Moonhawk and her crew are called out to investigate, but all is not as it seems when the Outsiders are involved. Are they acting alone, or are they receiving help from the Alliance's arch nemesis: The Crysallian Collective?Discover who is the Inside Outsider!"
3,Good movie. Recommended.,"A snake discovers the power to transform itself into a human being, then goes searching for love in this 2003 Bollywood production.It was an excellent movie of the 2003. this would not be a movie that one wants to keep in the library and watch again. The viewing satisfaction of the first time will not repeat itself."
5,Ginkgo Norse silverware,"Good qulity silverware for a reasonable price. After more than a year of daily use and frequent trips in the dishwasher, there is no rust or scratches . The finish is understated and elegantly smooth. It's easy to clean because there are no grooves or crevices where food gets trapped.I've had lesser silverware that deforms (bends and then breaks), dents (creating an uneven or even jagged eating surface for your mouth), or simply come new with sharp metallic edges.This consistently performs as desired."
3,"Nice looking, but somewhat flawed","Pros: Modern, clean design. Price.Cons: Sharp edges on handles, rusting after a few dishwashes.Overall it's a decent set of flatware for the money. That said, I find the edges a little sharp, especially the bottom of the handle. The knives have also started to rust a little only after a few washes."
5,"CLEAN ELEGANT, CLASSY","I had more people than I had flatware and dishes for during the holidays so I was forced to order up more of everything. This set of flatware has a nice classy look that makes any table appear elegant. My Christmas Eve dinner table looked superb, thanks to you! Appreciate your super fast delivery, the fact that it was available through Amazon, and your excellent packaging. Couldn't be happier! Many thanks! :)"
1,Nothing to pull me in to want to keep reading.,The events in the story are so far fetched and seem to occur just to keep the story dragging on. The romance seems a little immaturely written. The book does not flow very well (very choppy). I had a hard time finishing it.
1,Not a reference book,"I have to admit that it is an excellent book if you want to do research or find refrences about a topic, but if you want to keep it handy in your practice or use it for passing tests then you better buy something else or you need to buy at least the last ""3"" editions of the book. because all chapters refer to old editions for diagnosis,epidemiology or what os ever.basicaly you need to page all 3 last editions to get a clueabout what you were looking for."
2,...not the best.,"The first two performances were nice, mainly b/c one included an early Zoe Jakes which was interesting to see how much she has improved up to this point. Overall though, I found most of the performances to be quite rough around the edges, some didn't seem well rehearsed, there was a lot of ""tugging"" on costumes during the middle of a dance, the ""asian"" piece seemed almost to be mocking instead of interesting, and basically the entire thing just lacked a certain ""finish"". I'm glad I rented it from my local belly dance shop (Black Sea Trading Company) before purchasing b/c I would have been very dissappointed."
2,Not a keeper.,"I'm becoming bored with all the tribal dancing at the moment but I watched this DVD as I had heard a lot of good things about it. I found it okay but I really can't think of anything in particular that made me go 'wow!'Curiously there is one act with a guy just hoola hooping. While I acknowledge there is skill in what he is doing, why is it on a belly dance DVD? And I found it very distracting that he had to keep pulling up his shorts. Perhaps he's also a plumber?I sold my copy to a friend."
4,"Tall, Blonde & not from our time","Miranda has finally found ""The Plague of the North"", a long lost Viking frozen perfectly in time. As she and herfather were the heads of the team of scientists to discover the frozen Viking they are awarded the luxury of firstexamination, before the frozen man will go to other scientists for further study. However Mirandas frozenspecimen defrosts, her lab is broken into and her life is turned upside down-for the better. Miranda and Rolf(her viking) then under go the dangerous quest of recovering his ship with an unknown enemy trying to stopthem.Sigh, I wouldn't mind my own Viking, just not sure I'd have the patience to bring him into the modern day erawith all of our technology. For this reason, I found the concept of the story hard to believe even though I verymuch enjoyed this quick read."
3,Advertised as CP Kids - but labeled for Babies!,"This is advertised for Cabbage Patch Kids, but when it came it's too small because it's labeled for Cabbage Patch Babies! My daughter has a smaller baby doll it can fit but it bothers me that it's advertised wrong!"
3,VERY LOUD! USE EARPLUGS!,"This does a nice job, but is EXTREMELY LOUD! I use earplugs when using it. It has a very nice feature where you can retract the brush bristles inside the unit which avoids your hair tangling onto it, and it doesn't take long to get the curl or hair smoothing you would be looking for. It would get a 5 star rating from me were it not for the deafening sound."
2,A mediocre introduction to EJB,"Upon first reading this book, I didn't know to think little of it. Then I took reading other EJB books and found this one wanting for the following reasons: Entity Beans are described prior to describing Session Beans (when Entity Beans can be likened to specialized Stateful Session Beans), at no time did the book clearly and concisely state the bare minimum necessary to implement a Entity and Session Beans, and the book seemed to assume prior knowledge of other Java technologies such as JNDI and RMI.As I stated above, there are other books out there (that I will not name as I believe that I had a review censored for naming a book) that more clearly delineate what an EJB developer needs to know to hit the ground running. Look elsewhere."
5,Perfectly Portable,"I spent the past year planning a three-week trip to France/Monaco and Italy with my family this summer (2005). I browsed all of the travel guides and bought several. I love the large Eyewitness guides and I own the Eyewitness Guide to Venice, but you CANNOT carry it with you while you are touring around. It's too heavy. Plus, you don't need all of the background information at that point. So I read the complete Eyewitness Guide to Venice and the Veneto before I left for Italy and carried the Top 10 Travel Guide to Venice with me. I also carried around my Top 10 Travel Guide to Tuscany, which is excellent. So I disagree with the reviewer who recommends only buying the complete Eyewitness Guide; buy them both! One of the most useful parts of the Eyewitness Top 10 Travel Guide to Venice is the map of the vaporetto system; it is indispensable! Enjoy your trip to Venice!"
5,Super book with great ideas and techniques,Good breadth of projects and techniques. Takes you through the process step-by step. A good place to start. Kummli & Serafini's book has more inspiring pictures and different ways to bead around cabochons for when you are off and running and want more inspiration. This book is more basic and easier to start with but the designs are also more limited.
5,Fun durable puppet!,My son wanted a turtle where the head and leggs could go into the shell. This puppet is perfect and very durable. He loves it.
5,Excellent for Dia de los Muertos and the death topic in general,"This was in a library kit to help kids deal with death, and we loved it so much we ordered our own. The first person to pass after my daughter was born was my own grandma, and my daughter was only 2 so it was tough to approach this subject before we had to do the funeral. This book made my husband tear up because it reminded him of his own granny. The text is simple and honest without being too much information, and the butterfly metaphor is beautiful. If you happen to have any Mexican heritage, then the cultural setting will be bonus points. I am making a tradition of reading this every year for Dia de los Muertos in Santa Cruz's own monarch butterfly grove, it's so perfect for our family."
5,Pocketbook Pasta,"This is the perfect travel sized pasta book. It comes with many yummy recipes for making the pasta as well as many recipes involving the pasta. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. This would make the perfect book to bring with you when cooking at someone elses, if you know what I mean!"
2,international economics,"Have those reviewers really read the book? As I started reading, I found that Figure 2-3 in Part ONE is misprinted, that the definitions of the key terms are not clearly mentioned where they are indicated, and that it is hard to find the key point in each section with too long verbal explanations on mathematical points. The authors are famous, I know. BUT do they really try to let us understand the subject?"
5,Hand sculpted House,This book contains nearly everything you need to know in order to build your own house from clay and sand (cob).It's well written and it seems that the authors have bigger projects going on around the world. Would be nice to have a link to their work so readers can follow their exploits. Contains a lot of practical advice on how to get your project going. Just add your own inspiration.
3,Not bad,I read this based on a review of a later book in the series. Wanted to start at the beginning. Not bad is an honest evaluation
5,Top Notch Sounds,Big band sounds that please the ear are plentiful on this album. Depth and richness are added by the inclusion of istruments not often heard in a big band setting. I recommend this to anyone who wants a very satisfying big band listening experience.
5,Walden,"Although Walden is without a doubt one of the great books of all time it is a very difficult read. This is the type of book that requires patience and thought. Much of the challenge is centered on words and phrases that Thoureau uses that were commonplace in the 1800's but foreign to many of us in the 21st century. He probably would have had just as difficult a time trying to understand iPods and texting and reality TV. I found myself losing interest frequently because I didn't understand what he was trying to say. But, just when I was ready to give up there would appear a sentence or paragraph that were mesmerizing in thought and visualization and all of a suddent the effort seemed worthwhile. I would encourage everyone to give it a go. It's the kind of book that belongs on the coffee table not to impress but to draw your attention when your mood is thoughtful. I am sure that I will come back to this book often."
1,Terrible,"Lame Lame LAME! This is a CD of terrible keyboard synthesized music with chirping birds. How in the world is can this be called Irish music? If you want Irish music, at least check out a group that has a few real instruments on it or sounds even vaguely ""Irish."" The heart of Irish music is in the unique instruments that are used, not in slow tired muzac. Avoid this CD at all costs! Don't waste your money!"
1,I Blame Myself For Being Dumb Enough To Watch This Film!!,"This is, by far, the most idiotic, pretentious, and nonsensical film I have ever seen! I'll spare you the details of the film, you can find them elsewhere! Better yet, save your time and go buy a Weekend At Bernie's film. At least the Bernie's films never pretended to be ""serious""! Like other reviewers, I too rooted for these guys to get killed! No one can seriously be as dumb as the three guys in this film! Walk away, better yet run, from buying this film... you'll regret it for a long time to come. I'm regretting that I can't give it less than one star in this review!!!"
3,"Great, except for the clothes","I love these dolls, but they are actually a wee big for some of the furniture in the Plan Toys Chalet. My only real complaint is the clothing. My daughter tries to dress and undress them, which is not something I recommend. The little girl's skirt is so wide it falls down, so the shirt really keeps it on. However, the shirt is made out of such cheap material that the side seams ripped the first time my daughter took it off the doll. The belts were almost immediately pulled off and lost. My daughter is not really the destructive type. It seems natural that small children would try to dress and undress the dolls, but it really does destroy the clothing."
1,boring! Playmobil people work better with the Plan Toy Chalet Doll House,"We got this family to go with our daughter's plan toys dollhouse. They are so boring! If you get the Plan Toy Chalet Doll House (love this house), the playmobil people fit perfectly!"
4,Modern Doll Family - Plan Toys,"The family is a great addition to Plan Toys Chalet Dollhouse. They are fairly easy to manipulate around the house. They stand up well with the little maneuvering of their feet. While they do fit on the furniture that came with the house, their frame does seem a little large for the scale of some pieces. For example, you really have to jam a kid into the lower bunk on the bunk bed to make him/her fit. Their clothing can also be a little problematic. The fabric bunches up depending on how you move them and the adult female doll and child male doll have clothing that falls off or down. All in all I would recommend them however."
3,Wow!,"I have to say the dolls themselves are fine, but what were they thinking when they designed the ""dad"" in this set?? He is the ugliest looking thing!! His hair is sticking out all over and is some kind of horrid orange color. He looks like a total goober. Even my daughter looked at him like ""what is THAT??"" The skirt on the daughter doesn't stay up most of the time and my daughter is too small to fix it herself. The son looks like he came from some other parents. But they are still okay for pretend play. My daughter loves playing with little wooden dolls like this, so they aren't a total waste, just be prepared for one funny looking family!"
4,Perfecto,"De los tres DVD que actualmente tiene Steve Hackett en el mercado, este me parece el que ofrece una visión más completa del artista. EL repertorio elegido, excelente, es interpretado con gran convicción y sin exceso alguno de alarde por el grupo. Quizás se pueda achacar a Hackett un poco más de variedad en los temas que elige para los conciertos, prácticamente más de la mitad son los interpreta sistemáticamente desde principios de los 80. No hay ninguna necesidad de seguir tocando Horizons cuando tiene decenas de temas impresionantes para guitarra clásica. La excelencia de los últimos discos de Mr. Hackett le permiten hacer de ""King Crimson"" y centrarse en ellos sin necesidad de echar mano del pasado, ni suyo, ni de Genesis, aunque siempre sea de agradecer escuchar tan grandes temas."
4,Think for yourselves,"I'm amazed at the controversy here over the ""diet"" that Dr. Chopra recommends. This is not a ""diet book."" It is an excellent introduction to the world of Ayurveda, the ancient Indian health system that teaches everything is a balance, and that there are no wholesale answers that work for everyone. We must all weigh our own circumstances and needs and conditions, and make smart decisions based on our own unique situations. Lemmings need not look for answers here-buy Dr. Atkins and follow it to the letter if what your looking for is instructions, rules, and someone else to do the thinking for you. Everyone else, get this book to learn how to think about your health intelligently and for yourselves."
2,Perfect Health: A Review,"This Item was rated as practically new, but it had come apart from the binding and there were many underlinings. I was not inclinced to rate it highly as a result."
2,An unfortunate yawner,"When I heard the author discuss this book on Late Night with Tom Snyder, I immediately jumped out of bed and ordered it from Amazon. I wish I hadn't. This was a journalist who sailed around the world on a cargo ship. Actually, it was a converted Russian ice-breaker. The journey is evidently one of introspection, and he shouldn't have bothered with the small amount of material he had to examine. He whines and complains and snivels until you wish he had fallen overboard. Too damn little about the ship and too damn much about himself. That Jaynes chose to read War and Peace on his journey was ironic. When I slugged through Tolstoy, my only goal for the last third of the tome was just to finish it and get it over with. I can say the same thing about the last third of Come Hell on High Water. There were some great moments, mostly when Jaynes discusses his career as a journalist. Some of those anecdotes were great. Jaynes should write that book."
2,Talented writer produces mean-spirited travel book.,"I always loved Jaynes when he wrote for the NY Times and my files are filled with clippings of his articles which I share with my feature-writing students. I enthusiastically bought his book and kicked myself for doing so after the first ten pages. The main focus of the book is how Jaynes can make fun of the passengers with whom he travels. He clearly hates women, old people, and fat people--to name just a few. Jaynes went out to find himself. I wonder if he likes what he found. I didn't."
5,Great quality,"Reached in time, a very good quality, good package.Good material with a beautiful color!!Highly recommend this item for all users."
3,Quick fix for Shane and Popes junkies.,"The Shane influenced tracks on this album really stick out. The Shane-sung 'Chinos Place' is by far the best track on the Album and if you can picture the type of music Marc Boland would have released had he been a Paddy you've got the track in one. 'Pump action Paddy' is destined to become a concert chant along classic and 'Jukebox' is almost as good as the version Shane was singing with the Popes live in 96/97. Its brilliant to hear Spider doing the Poetry intro on the manic heavy metal banjo piece 'The Beast'. Mad Dog does well in Shanes shadow and 'Sleepless Nights' and 'The Rose' are truly lovely rural Paul Brady type classics , proving Mad Dogs song writing caliber. All in all this is a good album , but mainly its just a quick fix for Shane and the Popes junkies. Hurry up guys , get Spider in the band and release another 'Shane Mac Gowan rules'album quick!"
5,A true classic cartoon,I first experienced Danger Mouse while stationed in Europe. When the Chance to purchase the entire series became available I jumped at it. All the characters are unique.
2,Severly Dissapointed,"I purchased this book thinking it would be like many of the other resource kits Microsoft makes. Boy was I wrong! For starters the book has incomplete or erroneous information. It is apparent that this book was written before the product was released. It's level of information is geared more towards the beginner-intermediate audience. The most glaring deficiency is the TOTAL absence of ANY software tools! All you get on the CD is an HTML copy of the book! So if your looking for that utility that lets you migrate print services, or any scripts, you came to the wrong place! I think this one will leave a bitter taste in the mouth of many other MCSE's also! This would have been more appropriate as RUNNING WINDWOS XP , than the resource kit! Save you money if your an admin you can do with out this one."
3,Fast running watch,The watch is truly nice and well made. The only problem is that it makes an extra minute per day. A bit annoying.
5,Men' dive watch,"This item was received in a timely maner. Everything was as advertized. I would recommend this buyer with a 5 plus.William D. Brinson, Sr."
5,Love it... make more flavors.,"I have been drinking these for over 3 years and I love it. I drink it at home, work, before/after the gym... anytime really. I find myself more hydrated and consuming more than water alone because of the light flavor this has to offer. Great product! I wish there was more flavors."
5,More important than the bible....,"This is more than a book. It's as if God Himself decided to reach-down from above and create a tome of enlightenment, one illustrated-page at a time. BRILLIANT. Buy two copies and leave one in yr local hotel's dresser-drawer. You'll be glad you did."
5,Drawn into worship,"If you desire to grow in your worship of the Lord for who He is, to deepen your praise of Him, pick up a copy of Jerry Bridges' 31-day devotional I Exalt You, O God. Admittedly, I have been wandering in a bit of a spiritually dry place. So, reading this devotional was well-timed refreshment for me.The book is divided into four sections: exalting God for his greatness, holiness, wisdom and love. Each day, Bridges addresses a quality of God's character found in Scripture and explains it in practical terms. Each entry ends with a beautiful prayer, rooted in the Scriptures. The prayers alone are a treasure!I have been challenged by everything I've read by Jerry Bridges, and this book is no different. An excellent devotional, worth reading again and again.I received this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
2,"Good code, mediocre explanations, rampant typos","I agree with the other reviewers concerning good code and rampant typos. However, the author seems to think the audience is captive, and is willing to put up with his idiosynchracies. [I for one am not.] As an example, much discussion is devoted to the comparison of the GCD algorithm variants, so much so that one of the variants, Left Shift Binary, is ""name-dropped"" in the middle of the text, leaving the reader wondering why it deserves mention. The Least Remainder variant is missing critical information on the modulo arithmetic operation - namely, that '%' gives the same result on argument pairs with differing signs, even though the quotient is not the same as with same sign pairs. '%' just works, and that's all we are expected to care about.Overall, the book appears more like a user manual: the code works, and is packaged for the user. Code applications are covered in the ""manual""."
5,Great all around rock concert,Ronnie shows why he has been a mainstay of the British and World rock community for the past four decades. A featured member of the Faces with Rod Stewart and for the past 28 years or so the Stones. His guitar playing doesn't have the finesse of a Clapton or the inventivness of Jimi Hendrix but it's right in the pocket and the rhythm is rock solid much like his bandmate Keith Richards. His vocals remind me of Bob Dylan a little rough hewn but very effective. Slash makes an appearance and adds a lot of fire to the event. Ronnie is your quinessential 60s 70s rock star. He still has the haircut from that period. He plays and sings like he's having a great time and letting the audiance in on the fun also.
2,Far from good,"Ron Wood and Family for 1 hour, Live on DVD.I have been a Ron Wood Fan since the Faces days. Still am.For this DVD, 1 Star goes to Ron Wood and for the songs that are initially great; Another Star goes to the great Guitarist Slash who adds some perfect guitar sounds to this bad concert.Nothing else worth mentioning other than the bad filming, sound and lighting, through out all the duration of this DVD."
4,Fiddler's past draws him and Fiora to Napa Valley...,"The unlikely not-quite-married couple of Fiddler (hard-boiled P.I.) and Fiora (semi-psychic financial wizard) takes on jealousy and greed in winedom's fabled Napa Valley. While not one of the couple's most remarkable adventures, perhaps, it's still entertaining -- and informative, too, both about grape-growing and wine-producing, and about Fiddler's own shadowy (and very personal) past. This series is very human and literate at the same time, and highly recommended (though, sadly, too often out of print)."
4,Sophisticated flask for little $,"I bought my first flask on the street in NYC about a year ago for $20 and it felt as a cheap toy. Being happy that I lost it I decided to buy the Metrokane based on the reviews here at Amazon. I am very happy with the quality and the look of it. It came in a nice box and has an expensive feel to it, even though I paid less for it than for my first one which I hated. I am not in any way an expert in flasks, but I don't think you'll be disappointed in this one.UPDATE:After several months of moderate use, the glued-on leather started to peel off at the corners. Doesn't look as good as it did when new. Still does its job though. Not a deal breaker for me, but some people might be disappointed. Downgrading to 4 stars due to that."
3,The adhesive problem,"It wasn't expensive, but a brand name I know. Because of that, I didn't read the reviews beforehand. The 3.5 stars were enough to make the purchase. Unfortunately, after it arrived and the faux leather was peeling off inside the packaging, I was incredibly disappointed. It was fixed easily enough, just a little bit of hot glue, but I wish I had read the reviews and saved myself the trouble. Like another reviewer said, it is still a decent flask that I'll use occasionally, but I'll look for something better made."
3,Product description and picture not accurate,"The product I received is completely pink - including the top and the side panels. No black. Also the item is quite tall. If you fill it too high, it will fall out of cup holder when you go around turns."
5,Bes Water Bottle out there!,This water bottle keeps water very cold and its very durable and washes well. I have had it for two years and its never cracked. I bought the same bottle on Amazon in blue and it broke the first week I had it. It was not even close to being a well maded as this one.
1,caveat emptore,"buyer beware:what amazon or the description on the box do not state is the operating system necessary to be used. only when you insert the CD to your pc, do you learn it operates only on windows 3.1 or 95!!! talk about living in the early 90's.who uses those antiquated OS today???"
3,Great Film... shame about the dubbing...,"I loved this film, but on DVD they seem to have messed up the sound track. Lips move, but speech follows a fraction of a second later, just enough to create a very odd experience. Give it a miss."
1,"Warning, Warning, no plot, Dr. Smith!!!","What happened to this movie?! The special effects were convincing and even advanced and believable. But when it came to the plot, all we got was a hackneyed view of some metal space spiders out of Battlestar Galactica and a thoroughly unbelievable time-travel sequence, which wasn't necessary in the first place. Talk about suspension of disbelief, this movie required the science of the impossible! No reactor, no matter how powerful (and this includes the Jupiter 5 main engine) can be manipulated into producing space/time vortexes! This would require something on the order of a black hole, not a puny spacecraft. How about a remake with a believable plot?"
5,This is what DVD is meant for.,"1) amazing visual effects 2) well-composed soundtrack 3) lots of extras - including informative and fascinating commentaries. + an exciting adventure story, insights into family relations, and some very good performances (Hurt, Rogers, LeBlanc, and Oldman). Underrated by some critics, it is a highly entertaining and thoughtful Science Fiction/Adventure film."
1,Lost In The Re-write,"I assume that at some point this project had a much better script than the final one in order to get William Hurt and others involved. I'll hold that in my mind as the only way they would get into this mess. It has action and special effects enough for 4 movies, but the plot is all over the map and never congeals into anything special.With the talent and money that they must have had this is one poor excuse of a movie."
3,"cool movie,but doesn't scale any great hights",This movie is fun to watch but isn't anything great. Cool to watch with a bunch of friends
1,So bad it's not even anywhere near funny,I can't get over how bad Lost in Space is. It's so pitifully dumb one has to wonder if the script was written as the movie was being filmed. This is MTS3K material and everybody involved should be ashamed.
1,Boring!,"Pass four bucks on this one. This has got to be one of the worst effects, story, and characters I have ever seen in my life."
4,Not shakespear but fun,"If you go into this movie expecting sublime plots or whatever, then you're doomed to dissapointment, if you go in, just expecting a fun movie, then it can be a lot of fun. It is in no way, other than a few homages, tied to the original TV series, so don't go expecting it to be a continuation. It's not. It's a stand-alone story, and, as such, stands alone. It's typical summer scifi action movie fare, and for the day, the CGI was really good. Now it's dated, and suffers in comparison, but CGI always does that. Overall, a fun movie. Interestingly enough, this version had a lot about french subtitles and features, so I am guessing this is the french export version, no problems, just thought I would put that out there."
3,lost in space,I thought this was very funny and had a lot of action . I think this is a great movies anytime of the year.
3,Matt LeBlanc,"Okay, at least Matt tried his best with a cast better than the cast of Friends. Unfortunately, Robot was even better than him. Heather Graham, William Hurt and the rest of the family did justice to the old tv show. I loved the cameos from the old cast. The only thing I didn't like was the bad guy (an infected Dr. Smith) and the writer's attempt at the time paradox plot. I'd rather watch Time Cop again if I want a paradox."
4,"Classic, kinda hokey, but awesome","Awesome flick from my younger years, I kinda expected it to suck when I went back and watched it (a la Phantom Menace). However, despite some of the cheesy effects and some of the campy dialogue, I actually still enjoy it quite a bit."
3,Okay,"It was okay. not much of a story line and no memerable lines accept for ""If this is a dream where are the girls?"" Not a big screen movie."
2,BBB - boring beyond belief,"Sorry folks, having grown up during the era of Star Trek, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, this remake movie bears some similarity to the series but unfortunately did not come anywhere near my expectations hopes or dreams. Put me to sleep halfway through. Not worth the powder to blow to hell. Hope there's no sequel.....that would be more of a tragedy than the money spent on Uncle Billy's lies on tape......save your money for something else."
3,"A great movie for ten year olds, who are tired of Godzilla.","If you want to demo your video gear, invite your friends over. If you want to demo your brain, show them Forbidden Planet or Blade Runner instead."
2,Big is not necessarily better,"Once more Hollywood messes with a classic show and overcomplicates it. Great effects but in this day and age these still need to support a good story rather than vice versa. The film is an adequate scifi yarn until the Jupiter leaves the Proteus, but after that it seems as if someone mixed up the scripts. If I wanted a touchy feely movie I'd have rented one. Two other points. Firstly - what was that little alien all about - the only reason I could see it being in the film was for the toy marketing that accompanied it. Secondly does the actress who played Penny really speak like that - she sounded as if she swallowed a vocoder and was inhaling helium all the time"
2,"Not inspiring, but a good time","I had fun watching this movie, but only after I suspended various stages of disbelief. This movie contains bad acting, bad dialogue, plot inconsistencies, and a few very pointless displays of high-tech special effects. However, it's a lot of fun: there are some very good lines and some priceless moments. Overall it's not a bad movie, just a silly, but nevertheless enjoyable one."
4,A fun space adventure.,This was surprisingly hard to find. I was pleased to find it here. A certain sci fi classic. A fun addition to any DVD collection. Will Robinson and Robbie the Robot live on.
2,Not worthy of the original TV series.,"When I heard about the film in coming attractions, I was psyched about going to see it. I instantly fell asleep watching it in the theaters. And who wouldn't during a boring film with nice, plush comfortable stadium seating seats? The original show is the best bet to watch, it's good fun for the family and is a classic TV program. The only reason why I gave it two stars was because it had good special effects. That still doesn't make it more interesting, though. Star Wars is the best sci-fi film to see. Let me sum all of this up: BORING CRAP."
1,A Dreary Mess,"This dreary, no fun mess has nothing to offer except excellent special effects and great sets. William Hurt looks embarassed, and I never thought I would see Gary Oldman UNDERPLAY a role. Horrible clumsy script, flat characters, depressiong tone."
1,Kid's movie,"I was really looking forward to see this movie as I like to watch science-fiction movies and Gary Oldman performing. But it came out differently. This film is about a dysfunctional family, but unfortunately the whole film is dysfunctional. A lot of cliché's and (unwilling?) references to other movies and tv shows. Spider Smith looked like a combination of 'Darth Vader' and 'Death' in Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'. The spider aliens looked like they crawled out of 'Alien'. Time travelling is explained better in comical series like BBC's 'Red Dwarf'. The robots looked like upgraded version of the robots in 'Dr Who', resulting in a slapstick kind of movie. Hypergates and virtual reality didn't bring anything new. Matt LeBlanc looked like Tom Cruise flew his jet fighter straight in this picture. Soundtrack by Apollo 440. Probably chosen because of their name, but at least they got the sound good. This mission really sucked. I hope they weren't serious about making that sequel."
3,Ho hum sci-fi movie,"Outside of Star Trek, there are not that many sci-fi TV serials before Star Wars in 1977. Probably the most famous was Lost in Space, about a family of scientists - explorers who get lost in space. And like all famous TV shows, it was eventually made into a full-length feature film with updated special effects and more depth to the science. This one came out in 1998, and stars a cast full of well-known names such as William Hurt and Gary Oldman. I have never seen the original TV serial, so I cannot compare them, but I will say this was an alright movie. William Hurt was key to the movie as his demeanor and on-screen gravitas carried the script. Gary Oldman plays a good villian, and Heather Graham makes her only appearance in a sci-fi that I know of. The movie has some comedy, some action, and believable special effects. However, there were better sci-fi movies from the 1990's more worth your time; such as The Matrix and Dark City."
3,"Good story, so-so writing","I was interested in the premise of the book when I picked it up at the bookstore for an upcoming vacation. The plot itself was well-conceived (although as I read, it seemed like I'd heard the story before in a lot of late-60s/early-70s spy movies and TV shows). But the writing itself was a little disappointing. Meade's presentation of the story was somewhat labored, some of narration repetitive, and the injection and development of so many minor and supporting characters made it confusing. Furthermore, Meade ought to shoot his editor, or spring for a word processing program with spell-check and punctuation-check.I confess to being compelled to finish the book, especially toward the end, but it was too easy to put down, especially on a beach where it's main competition for my attention was my bikini-clad wife and other similarly-attired females."
2,Read Snow Wolf instead.,I liked Snow Wolf enough to buy the hard bound edition of Brandenburg. What a mistake. The book had all the components to be a great read but stalled within a few pages. I tried to finish this book several times but could not hack my way through.
3,leave them be,"sometimes they come back was a classic horror movie but with a sense of style that makes you question wether its just a horror or somthing else. it ended and it ended well, king wrote no sequels. now pet cemetary 2 was good and all but whats with the sequels. make a good movie and let it be. dont start adding sequels till the ideas just stupid."
3,Poirot has had a personality transplant.,"I was so looking forward to watching this, as I consider David Suchet's portrayal of Christie's diminutive detective a tour-de-force par excellence. However, this Poirot was cranky, glum, glowering and dogmatic with none of the flashes of puckish humor that contributed so much to the series in the past. I realize the storyline does not lend itself to a light touch, but in contrast to this version, the big budget version and Albert Finney's portrayal now seems more true to Dame Agatha's vision of Poirot, something I never thought I'd say. Even so, the story itself is a classic and worth watching, especially for someone not familiar with the plot line. I doubt I'll buy the series, however. I like Poirot as he was in the earlier series."
1,The Movie With Albert Finney is Tops!!!!,"If you have viewed the movie starring Albert Finney along with a long list of other top stars, you will be greatly disappointed in this version. It lacks all the professional performances and the outstanding production and direction, plus all the amazing costumes. The photography of the train is also more authentic and beautifully done. I was greatly disappointed in the David Suchet version and do not recommend it -- instead purchase the Finney movie, you will not be disappointed in that one."
2,Elbow grease and a blowdryer,"All you need is a razor blade scraper, a blow dryer to loosen the film and a bit of elbow grease. The ammonia and water spray help too but you can make your own ""kit"" cheaper then this."
3,Decent product but nothing special,"I was a little disappointed by the way that the lid set into the pitcher as it seemed to have a gap between the two pieces. I thought that a Rubbermaid product such as this would have been constructed better, however for the price you cannot complain too much. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a quick and easy solution, however I would continue looking for a more reliable product for a long-term solution."
5,Beautiful Acoustic Album,"Jay Nash's second album is a beautiful, soulful collection of well-crafted acoustic songs. His voice, dripping in emotion, expresses a depth of feeling that seeps down into your very essence. He's been there. You don't so much listen to his songs as you feel them. You can feel it in his voice, in his lyrics, in the touch of his fingers on the strings. Unforgettable. A worthy addition to any collection."
5,LOOKED BETTER THAN NEW DODGE ONE,put this one on the left front and a OEM hub on the rh side. Timken unit looked nicer than the OEM. We will see which one lasts the longest
4,Relevant read,This book is necessary for my doctorate program. I find it relevant and on level. This will be an asset as I prepare my dissertation.
4,"Use the brick, Luke...","Lego star wars. I know what your thinking, ""What the hell?!?!"" No way! I was expecting a piece of crap considering how bad ALL of the previous lego games were. GOOD GAME. I would highly recommend this. The good stuff is the fun puzzles and collecting the ""minikits"" and filling up your ""jedi meter"" to get to the ""?"" level. The puzzles are fun, the lego characters are funny and inovative, free play mode with a bunch of SW characters is fun, and the hack 'n slash gameply is over all playable.What is bad? Ok, if you die, you lose 1000 studs, or money, and respawn in the same room. Too easy. Also, the game can be beaten in a measly 6 or 7 hours. Thats about it. Buy the game! I'm a tough critic! I gave Halo 2 a 4! I'm tough as nails! get the game damnit!"
3,Looking for games for my son,"I looked up ""xbox 360 games for a 4 year old"" and this along with two other games came up. my son finished this game when he was around 10 months. he is now 34 months and wants to build his gamer score. I was hoping to find something a bit more challenging without the gore so I searched in 4 yr old. I guess hes a bit ahead of his time lol. our entire family is game crazy so he picked it up early and while this game was fun when he played it if youre a serious gamer it gets old fast."
4,"Good, but not as good as LEGO star wars II","When I bought the game and went home to play it, I grabbed my brother, and we crashed ourselves onto the sofa (couch.) Things went ok for me and my brother, we started out as Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. We did not know what to do at first. Then we went through a door, the top had a I on it. We then started playing Episode I The Phantom Menace! In a matter of weeks we beat the game with a little help from our friends. Soon, when we had enough characters to play as for Free Play Mode, me and my brother had so much fun playing. Our favorite episode to play in was Episode III Revenge of the Sith. We had so much fun untill the Sequel (LEGO star wars II came out!!Mixing LEGO's?! LEGO city?! I still have the first LEGO Star Wars game and we still play it, (once in a while that is)"
3,Lego Star Wars,I liked the game so much that i even purchased the second one. It was fun and full of different characters.
2,LEGO are fun but not in this game,"I love Star Wars, but nothing short of a Jedi Mind Trick could make me recommend this game. I realize the game is for children, but there was so much more that could have been done to make this title more interesting. Some of the cut scenes were cute, but overall the graphics were lacking and the levels tedious and repetitive. I got really tired of collecting studs and hearts. Two player mode was marginally better, but the game was frustrating during levels like the Pod Race since the game doesn't use splitscreen. You'll find that one player will most likely need to drop out and let the other finish the race just to get to the next level. Small children will love this game, but 10 and up should look forward to the release of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith game due out in May."
4,Tonight We Ride,"I had this cd on vinyl when LP's were still alive and well. (Who ever heard Of CD's?) Anyway the LP was an EP and there were only six songs at the time. ""Tonight We Ride"" was the hit but the other songs such as ""Thin Ice"" and ""Don't Throw It All Away"" were also great Tracks. This Cd offers so much more. This Band Is tight and should have gone further in their career. If You Know of the Sherbs. Then Buy this Cd, if you heve never heard of them then buy it and enjoy."
1,What a Fake,"The picture shows a pulley, two clevis', and a strap.It is only a bag. Very disappointed!"
4,Beautiful pattern,I sent 2 sets of this to my mother for next year-she loves it! It will make a beautiful addition to her table in the fall and winter and the price could NOT be beat. I am very pleased with my purchase. Amazon rocks!
1,a waste,"if you think this is music, think again. it's a documentary. a very poor one at that.don't waste your money on it."
5,Very Insightful DVD,"I'm sure most of the people who are reading this are familiar with the Classic Albums series. I knew what to expect before watching it but I was pleasantly suprised. The information on the history of Cream and how they progressed with Disraeli Gears in the studio was great. All of the major players (that were still alive) were interviewed. The footage that was available was amazing. The only piece that I hadn't seen was of the song ""We're Going Wrong"". It was live and in black and white. The band was pretty intense. Bruce's vocals were great as always, Baker was a colossus, but it was Clapton who really impressed me. He was playing like a madman and was looking intense. I recommend this DVD to any fan of Cream. It is a great companion DVD for anyone who bought the reunion show."
2,Could've been so much better.,"I loved Melissa Etehridge and her music since I first heard her in 1988. Since then I have weathered the good (YES I AM) and bad (SKIN) cds and always wondered whne she would do a greatest hits when others who came after her (namely Sheryl Crow) were already doing it.Well, it's finally here, and it is disappointing. I don't like the fake desert motif she was placed in at all.The 2 new songs Melissa wrote are just ""ok"". I like I RUN FOR LIFE alot better than the other. I do like her covers of REFUGEE & PIECE OF MY HEART, but I found it quite odd that she's turned to covers to get radio play.Very disappointed that YOUR LITTLE SECRET, NOWHERE TO GO, BREATHE (which was listed as being on the cd up until the last minute), ENOUGH OF ME & I WANT TO BE IN LOVE were not included."
3,Missing 2 songs :<,"I thought ""Breathe"" and ""I Wanna Be In Love"" were on here, and then i realized when i received the cd that they weren't. Too many crucial songs are missing, she should have just added one new song and the remake of Piece of My Heart, and added those 2 missing songs, or deleted ""Lucky"" and added ""Breathe"". Very disappointed, i'm going to return it."
3,Incomplete,"I have all of Melissa's cd's up through ""Skin"". I never really grasped onto the ""Lucky"" album. I was first drawn to her music from the ""Never Enough"" album, which I highly recommend. I've been quite the fan since then. Anyway, as for the new greatest hits album, I'm happy about the Refugee remake but I was really hoping she would give the true fans like myself, more obscure songs that were never released. For example, there was a song from the movie, ""Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael"", I think it was called ""Don't Look at Me"". So, I won't be purchasing this album. I'll just keep listening to all my cd's and wait until, perhaps, a double cd retrospective sort of thing comes along later."
2,Cheap,This is realy just junk. I had to glue all the drawers and nailgun them together to make them hold. It looks ok from 10' away but thats about it..
3,Good but could be better.,"After looking at the names on this CD, I was expecting it to be exceptional but was disaapointed. Alhtough a good CD, I think it could be much better.The DJ and remixers did not utlize their full potential, in my opinion.If you alreday own Shri Durga, you may or may not want this CD depending on your level of curiosity and how much you like the artists on this CD. If you don't recognize the names, then you are probably better off with the original."
2,Ought to be called Titmice of the British Isles,"This book is written to a very specific audience: backyard birdwatchers of Great Britain. So if you're British, you might like this book. However, the text is a little dull and the few lackluster photos don't liven it up."
1,Only Recieved One!!,"The toy is great, I'm sure the kids would love it, however, we only recieved one device, and that device was USED! We contacted the supplier, thinking that there was a simple mistake, and they told me that we only baught one and that a note was sent explaining this... the note was on the PACKING SLIP!! Nowhere in the product discription does it say that it is one device or that it is a used device. They said they would be glad to give us a refund, but that we would have to pay to ship it back to them. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!"
2,Very much like a video game,"If your goal is to engage a child who is otherwise not interested in math, this maybe a good program for you. However, my 1st grade daughter loves math and is frustrated by this game. Her ""video game skills"" are not sufficient for her to play some of the games well, even when she knows the mathematical answers. I would not recommend this to a child looking for math practice."
4,importance of an alkaline diet,hermans technical explanation of how acids and akaline properties are defined is very concise. however there is an unscientific bias throughout the book that is presented as fact. had his beliefs been presented as beliefs rather then facts i would have given this terrific book 5 stars. this book contains a considerable amount of vital information and is more then worth the ... cover.
2,Outdated,"This book is outdated. It is also very scientifically detailed. The author compares the acid/alkaline with the yin/yang of macrobiotics, so it would be a wonderful guide for anyone interested in macrobiotics. In my opinion a better selection is the Acid-Alkaline Food Guide by Susan E. Brown."
4,Good Classic Pilates Workout,"This is a good Pilates workout - all the exercises appear to be ""real Pilates"" exercises and not a fusion."
5,INSPIRATION!!!,"Collage for the Soul presents a wide array of handsome artwork and is complete with text on definition, process and technique. Holly Harrison and Paula Grasdal have assembled a stellar line-up of artists who generously share their personal expressions on canvas, in boxes, in book form, with fabric, and beyond. From simple to sophisticated, these pages will stimulate your thinking process on how to approach collage. The clear close-ups of the compositions, next to the materials listing and basic instructions, enables and encourages you to translate into your own individual creation. As a collage artist, I know that my focus and interests change and evolve so this book will be a constant resource of inspiration and information. Not to be missed!"
2,Lackluster,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. Based on reviewer comments I hastened to buy it, and then found it uninspiring. It presented nothing new, not an iota of soul and seemed like a simple compendium of collage work with some scattered instructions that may not be sufficiently clear."
2,Usefulness,"I ordered this handbook based on a recommendation from a professor of mine. I have used many handbooks in the past, but have not owned one until I bought this one. Unfortunately I never keep track of the authors on the other handbooks I have used. Therefore when I received this suggestion, I went and bought it. Once I received this book, I realized that this book has no useful integrals that I actually need. I am a physics major and none of the reoccurring integrals we use are listed in this book. I consider this a waste of money, and would buy a different/better handbook if your in the market for one."
2,Diffucult to use,"I owned and used this book for the last 9 years and I think it is one of the more difficult to use. Strange organization and mistakes have plagued me from the begining.If you really use a book like this a lot, then buy something else."
5,Review for Lego Star Wars PS 2 game,I purchased this game for my kids. They enjoy playing the lego star wars games. I had to send this game back to theseller. We were having trouble getting it to work in the play station 2 console. The seller has been very cooperative withme. He will be sending me a new game back. I hope this one will work better for my kids. I would recommend this to allwho enjoy the star wars lego adventure games.
5,Great Fun For All Ages,"Lego Star Wars I game can be played by children and adults, with equal fun for both. I don't usually play video games, and even I could do it and get caught up in the fun! It isn't too difficult for beginners, but still presents a challenge for the true video gamer. I would definitely recommend this game!"
4,fun time,"I like Lego Star Wars, and don't think the game is aimed toward children either. My only complaint is that we're already beginning to get flooded with too many Lego Star Wars games and I'm not going to sit around and put up with it. Actually, I can't do anything about it but complain. Pick up ONE Lego Star Wars game and, for the love of God, move on to something completely different and pretend that NO MORE than just ONE Lego Star Wars game exists. That way you won't go crazy when you see just how many DO exist."
1,Save your money,Do not buy this game for PS 2...THis game is on a blue disc for PS 2 it will not work...I bough this game at retail 40 bucks and it did not work in my PS 2...I went back and swapped it fo another one and that one did not work major problems...Do not get this game you will get screwed...
4,Lego Star Wars is good family fun,"Easy to get started, easy to play while still being challenging. My 6yr old and 10yr old both enjoy it as much as myself. And it is a snap to jump in or out of a game to make it two player or go back to one."
4,Great for the frustrated players,"MY 10 year old hates the games where she can't advance and repeatedly dies, so I got this as it was deemed more fun than challenging. What a relief, no more pouty moments and it isn't a game that will be put away and never played again. PLUS, for those that can't use blue disks (we can't anymore), we bought the GREATEST HITS version of the Lego Star Wars, and it comes on a silver disk, so apparently Sony figured that one out. So don't let that stop you from getting it."
5,"A fun game, but it needs some work","The game is very fun because you get to be a lot of different charecters. i have 38 out of 40 of them. if you are just trying to beat the game as fast as possible, then it takes about 3 to 5 hours. If you are actually trying to do the game right, it takes a lot longer. I've had this game for 4 days. i am still trying to unlock the secret of the game. i play for at least 5 hours a day.What i dont like about the game is that there are no voices. Hopefully, in the 4,5,6 edition, the characters will talk.Each character has a different ability which you need to complete the level. i mostley play free play mode, so i can get all the stuff i didn't get before. I would say that if you are thinking about getting this game, buy it."
3,"Good, not great ... returned it","A very light and fuctional watch. The face was a little small, and the minute counter on the chronograph is very difficult to read even under the best conditions. The lack of a saphire crystal and no protection around the crystal made me very nervous. The one benefit is that the alarm can be used as a countdown timer."
3,not the greatest,This book was alright itt isn't the best book I've ever read but it isn't the worst either. I probly would have liked it better if I was a little younger.
5,A Blessing,"We purchased this swing to help with our sons ""swing therapy"" for sensory processing disorder. It was so easy to install. From the moment my son sat in this swing, he has been in heaven. My daughter has a great time playing in it as well. I trust the swing completely, it is built so strong. It is very comfortable and has had an amazing affect on my son with regards to his therapy. It looks even better in person than it does in the pictures, and can be easily taken down and stored away. It comes with a mesh bag to store it in when you are not using it. I strongly suggest purchasing this product."
5,Excellent,"This book should be top of the list for any Hellenic Pagan, and also for those who wish to know more about the religion. It is exactly what it claims to be, a beginners guide on Hellenic Paganism covering various concepts as ritual, theology, spirituality and other aspects of Hellenism. The FAQ at the book of the text is an excellent resource for the less well-informed about the religion, and factually the book is spot on and is well referenced. Any pagan knows that all too often information contained in these sort of texts are spurious and deliberately misinterpreted, however this book is very admirable in its adherence to historical correctness and its avoidance of new age & feel good concepts that characterise nearly all other Pagan resources. If you have heard the call of the Olympians at any stage of your life, I highly recommend you read this work."
4,Disc Brake Piston Compressor Tool,"Right out of the box you can tell this is a quality tool.Made from steel and in a great storage/carrying case.I used it to compress the pistons on the rear brakes of my 2004 VW Passat.Extemely easy to use. Each piston was compressed in under a minute each.Great for use on disc brake pistons that need to be rotated and pressed when replacing the pads.I know that this tool is designed for the sigular purpose of rotating and pressing but it could be easily modified to do the compress only. Adding the ability to remove the pin on the threaded shaft would allow this tool to be easliy used for both types of brakes.In addition, more detailed instructions would be a good improvement. Oboviously not required but better for a lay person to understand.All in all - Would definitely purchase again knowing all that is in this review."
2,"Interesting premise, weakly executed","This is a better-than-average installment in a tiny sub-genre. These types of films are usually squeamishly played for laughs; this one is marketed as a comedy, but becomes preachy during its last third. All of the entries in this sub-genre are low-budget affairs, and lack the funds (or the nerve) to show a convincing transformation. One curious note: the protagonist loves a lovely girl, but transforms into a grumpy and dumpy one."
1,Dumb and no fun,"Boy shags strainge woman in the woods, and starts to change into a female everytime he gets excited. meets beautiful girl who also turns into a boy, they take turns. Only good thing about this stupid movie is that the boys are cute. Don't waist your time."
3,"Pleasant Sounds, But Nothing Really New Here","I have nothing bad to say about this cd except that I was disappointed in its musical offering. This is nice, middle of the road, Brazilian music, that makes me want to hear the really great stuff, like Milton Nascimento, Dom Um Romao, Baden Powell. The singer is very pleasant and the lyrics, thank you 6 Degrees for publishing the translations, which you didn't do for the great Suba:Sao Paolo Confessions, are very unusual on some of the songs. But, there is really no new ground broken here. It is very nice, relaxing music that many people will probably enjoy, but, it is not memorable as the above mentioned artists are and the great Suba release which I think is a gem!"
1,cold reading in disguise,"numerology is just as accurate as cold reading is. all the ""predictions"" are soo vague and generalized that they can be applied to everyone.I recommend you to read a book on cold reading before you pick this one up. what cold reading is is playing with the language to make it seem like the predictions fit you individually."
3,Handy,Handy bag set to have. Can be used for wide variety purposes. Appears to be sturdy and reliable. A nice addition. I wonder if they have bigger bags?
4,Almost perfect,"Would have been perfect if the smallest bag was just an inch wider in each direction. Otherwise, great for keeping all the small parts from rolling around in the toolbox."
5,At Last!,At last - we've finally found a book that Mom and Dad love as much as our kids do! This book is hilarious - laugh-out-loud funny for kids and adults. The illustrations are perfect and a crack-up just on their own. Usually I am dying to return books to the library by the time they are due - we are renewing this one until they won't let us keep it any longer! We can't wait for Wild Boars Cook to come out!
5,Fun AND Funny!,"My 4 year old loves this book and I enjoy reading it to him, as opposed to many of his other books. This book is different and shocking in ways, but isnt that what a good book is? It will not lose interest for sure from you or your child. And I find that it does actually teach good behavior. All I have to say is ""are you acting like a wild boar?"" and my son's less than desireable behavior stops because he is laughing so much. A rare find indeed. Have a little sense of humor to those that gave it a bad review!"
1,Gave my mixed race daughter bad dreams.,"In this story, two pink cheeked polite little children aregrossed out and bullied by four brown, hairy, dirty, stinky,ugly, bossy, bad-tempered, violent, lying, flea ridden wild pigs.There is nothing particularly witty or creative about this book.Kids who like to gross out other kids might enjoy it. Kids who liketo make fun of smelly or otherwise less sophisticated kids mightenjoy it. My daughter aged 4 and son aged 7 both disliked thebook. If you want a really funny book which simultaneouslycaptures the hilarity of kid's bad behavior while at the same timepoking fun at it, I would recommend `Henrietta there'sno one better' by Martine Murray, which both my kids adored."
2,A dissapointing travel guide and review,"This book is primarily written for those who wish to travel ""on the cheap"".In most of the cities we visited (Frankfurt,Munich, Berlin)only inexpensive hotels,hostels,and pensions were listed. Restaurants described were mostly based on price,and not suitable for one who enjoys fine dining where the natives dine, and at reasonable prices.The book,being a paperback,is also very bulky,and is not practical to ""carry it on your trip""."
1,Horrible,"So, the bundle is now $305.99. A previous reviewer from July 24, 2008 tagged it at $284.95. Instead of coming down in price over time, it went up. Just looking up Black Hawk Down, I can get it new from $16 to $20. Hellboy runs $14 to $20. 12 movies for $305.99 = $25.50 per movie. Way too expensive."
1,As has been said...,"I actually already own most of these, so I know for a fact that it is MUCH cheaper to buy them separately than in this ""Bundle"". If the price were dropped, to entice new blu-ray player owners, it would be a hit.I say, drop it to $200 and market it as a blu ray starter kit, promoting it as a good match for every blu ray player and PS3."
5,This is the bible of the advertising industry - a gotta read,"David Ogilvy describes this as the most useful book on advertising that he has ever read. This book teaches all of us, from novice to veteran, everything we need to know to create advertising that sells; which is the whole purpose of the industry. Whether you are in a large agency or a one person show, reading this book will give you the edge you need. Read it. Then read it again. Considering the amount of tested information between the covers, it seems to me that the price you pay is a tiny fraction of its true value."
2,Please do not buy this book if you work in advertising!,"Do not buy this book! Why, you ask? This is a quote from chapter 15, p.212: ""In TV advertising, the manufacturers can get name publicity in two ways if they desire, namely, by flashing the product name in big print on the screen and by having the name frequently repeated by the announcer"" (!). Now, you're probably wondering why I'm giving a quote from *PAGE 212!*. Well, that's because I forced myself to read this because it was written by some legendary ad guy. But don't make the same error as I did. Please buy Ogilvy on Advertising, Cutting Edge Adverting, Creative Advertising and Hey Whipple instead. Yes, all of them instead of Tested Advertising Methods. You won't be disappointed. Or your money back (just kidding)."
5,The best book on advertising ever written.,"Dealing with the hocus pocus of ad agencies is mind numbing from a marketer's perspective. This book gives you the specifics to challenge their ""expertise."" The most important part of this book is that the underlying objective of advertising is ""to create sales"". You will not find that in most modern advertising books. Excellent book."
5,Must Have Marketing Book,This updated version of Caples masterpiece includes an incredible wealth of information. Excellent examples of good advertising is depicted and checklists of needed information for different situations are provided.Anyone interested in marketing a product or service should buy this book. This is not a rehashed book based on someone else's information. This appears to be the source that I have seen other marketers use as the basis for their marketing products.
5,great product for the price,I paid $49 for this player. Great product for theprice. Great flexibility in what it can play. Picture quality was just fine.
5,the best of the three,"although i haven't read these in a while, i totally enjoyed all 3 in the series. it seems that it takes her about 4 years to write a book, so i'm waiting rather (im)patiently for The Keeping Place. The Farseekers i think is the best out of the three. i found that Ashling, seemed to go into a whole new direction, not one that i would have expected. the plot became to complicated, lets hope that The Keeping Place sorts this all out"
3,I question if it is the original groups,I don't think you will be hearing the original groups but the ones singing are ok.I thought I was ordering the original groups.
4,TYPICAL MARTHA BOOK - NOT SO SIMPLE!,"While I must admit that I admire what these authors have accomplished, this is NOT a book for the beginning entertainer. The recipes, ones which I have prepared, are good, tasty, but not easy. Some of the directions are ambiguous and make the recipe more difficult. Again, this is a typical-Martha book - very ambitious and only for those who are of the ""Martha cult"" - are striving for perfection. Those of us who just like to entertain our friends the easy, not-so-perfect way - try - IT'S JUST A DINNER PARTY by Ron and Julie Malloy."
5,Awesome!!,This is definitely a must have for any kitchen or coffee table. The recipes are delicious!! The pictures are beautiful. She is absolutely awesome!!
5,What all cookbooks should be like,Beautiful book. Great photos. Easy to read. Great tasting recipes that are relatively easy to prepare.Anyone can download tons of recipes from the internet for free. When you purchase a cookbook you expect to get something special. This book is special.I highly recommend this book.
5,Unpretentious and Yummy,"This is my favorite cookbook. Everything I've made so far has been lovely enough to serve guests, yet unfussy to prepare. Recipes focus on fresh, in-season foods enhanced with seasonings or sauces rather than drowned in them. (Although look elsewhere for low-fat cooking.)This is ""welcome to my house, relax, eat this simple yet delicious food"" food rather than ""look, you're so lucky to be in my house eating with me, because I'm chic and trendy, and I'm using obscure ingredients"" food.Yay, Ina."
3,the barefood contessa cookbook,"I bought this cookbook for Christmas presents to several of my friends. I have 2 of her other books,which I really like, and I picked it because it was reviewed very favorably. I have to say I was disappointed in it compared to her other books. It doesn't have as manhy wonderful pictures and I didn't like the choice of recipes as well. I haven't looked at it that carefully so maybe my impression is premature."
5,These shoes rule!,"I think I actually bot these sub-$50 at Marshalls...but I would pay more for them next time. Perfect fit for medium wide feet. Very flexy rubber soles. Hold a shine well. Breathable partial cloth inside lining keeps feet cool and comfy. For a Made in China product, I am impressed!"
1,classic sequence ruined; it could make you cry,"Wild Style is unquestionably a classic but yo what Rhino did to this video copy is downright blasphemy. Check it during the sequence when Grandmaster Flash is cutting up in his kitchen, the Rock Steady are practicing their moves and Lee is bombing the amphitheater, they edit out Bob James' classic breakbeat ""Mardi Gras"" and add some limp wack beat that throws off the whole sequence. On my old copy of Wild Style, it was untouched, on the Rhino version, they butcher a classic sequence. Boycott Rhino."
5,"It's Old, It's Corny, It's Classic Old Style Jackie Chan","These have to be some of Jackie Chan's earliest works.I think it takes a true aficionado to fully appreciate this collection.This would be a 'must have' for any serious collector, to be complete.As an aficionado, I enjoy this collection the same as I do the old Keystone Cops movies, or W.C.Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and other unique, if dated, classics. We need to judge them in the light of the times in which they were created; not compared to modern film making techniques. It would be like comparing a classic model T Ford to the latest Ferrari. They each hold their own special place in history."
4,Fantastic Album,"I really liked the album especially ""Missing You"" with John Waite. Any fan of Alison will like this album."
4,Pretty listening but slightly morbid,"I love the music and her voice. However, almost every song is about death in some way. It's not offensive or depressing, and there are a wide variety of character perspectives which is interesting like reading historical fiction."
5,"Alison Krauss, the best of the best","I am a dedicated and loyal fan of this young lady. This CD, A Hundred Miles or More,is one of her best. Now a quote from a local newspaper writer - ""Alison Krauss could sing the telephone book yellow pages and still get a standing ovation."""
2,Disappointing,"It's been three long years of waiting for Alison to release a new album. This collection of songs, with very few exceptions, is mawkish, saccharine rubbish.Away Down The River, Sawing on the Strings and Missing You are about the only high points on an album of godawful Disney covers ('Baby Mine' from Dumbo), and schmaltzy, over countrified pop ('Simple Love'). Alison, at her godlike best, is heartbreakingly bleak and wonderfully thought out. This hastily thrown together mush is a huge let down for her legions of fans.Bring on her next release with Union Station, and if this is your first introduction to the Queen of Bluegrass, don't let this huge mis-step put you off, you'd be missing a lot. Check out So Long, So Wrong and her Live Album, or if it's solo work you're after the stately 'Forget About It' to get a true taste of this amazing talent, before she sold out. Let's hope its not permanent."
3,Some helpful info; many mistakes,"I actually picked this book up at the library for some early prep for a state subject-specific test I'll eventually have to take (not for the CLEP). However, while I know this is harder than anything I'll have to take, the questions are definitely difficult and cover all the different aspects (I was focusing on the social science area). However, there are many erros in the answer key. The detailed answer is correct but the letter corresponding to it may not be. My favorite question was:From 1845 to 1855, a considerable number of the immigrants to the U.S. came from:A) China B) Ireland C) Greece D) Russia E) Spain.Ireland, you say. WRONG. The answer according to the book is Germany. I have to admit from glancing at the other sections, I think the social sciences is easily the hardest. Anyways, it's worth getting if you are to take the CLEP probably but beware of mistakes. There probably is something better and more concise out there."
2,"Good Paintings, but Little Instruction","The book has excellent paintings throughout; however, this is an instruction book and it fails in telling or showing the reader how to develop the painting in pastels. The first few steps are the foundation of any painting and in this area the book is inadequate. Their is some instruction in this area, but not enough.The author also fails to show alternative ways to achieve the results desired. I like art instruction books that show more than one way to get to certain results but few do this. It is important, especially in books that are introductory in nature, to show more than one way to get to a result. Most art books fail to do this and this book is not an exception."
4,Pretty good album.,Pretty good for a local band. I bought it when I was first getting into punk rock and living in North Carolina. Good stuff.
4,No Miss,"I have been using this product for only about three months, but I can see definite positive results."
2,Not much difference,"I was so much encouraged by the 1st review that I shipped this item by one day shipping. Useless, nothing happened, if anything, my previous medicine was better."
1,GREAT DESIGN BUT RUNS VERY SMALL,THIS IS A GREAT LOOKING SHIRT BUT THE SIZES RUN VERY SMALL. I ORDERED AN XL WHICH IS WHAT I USUALLY LIKE TO WEAR BUT IT WAS WAY TOO SMALL. SO BEWARE OF SIZING!!!
3,Great Book,"I originally purchased this book for one of my college courses. As I read it, I learned many new ways to handle discipline problems as well as dealing with my own anger and frustration that often arises from disciplinary situations. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who may be having these type of issues."
5,Excellent !,If one wants to see how the upper class use to live in Edwardian England and how it ended with the waste of World War I. Than this is the place to go to. The BBC has outdone itself with this one.
4,The Complete Series of Upstairs Downstairs,"I have debated a while before buying this as I had seen some of the episodes when it first came out. At that time I was a nurse working shifts and we didn't have a recorder in those days.I am so pleased to have this series -- nostalgia and history win with me every time and I have not regretted buying this -- not one bit. I also liked the extras you get with the set, it is nice listening to Jean Davies describe how the idea came about and also listening to writers, producers was, as I found, very interesting. As for the stories themselves -- each episode could stand on its own -- although they do follow. You meet delightful characters and also there is a lot of pathos, I have cried a few times -- and laughed. If you enjoy well written, well acted, stories about Britain's past then buy it."
4,Up...and up...,"I just finished watching season one and enjoyed every minute of it. Worth the price. Don't miss the chance to see an intelligent, interesting, witty masterpiece theater. Delicious...."
5,It was the best television that I have seen in a long time.,"I thought Upstairs Downstairs was all I expected it to be. I a seventy five and had seen some of the origional episodes but that was years ago. It was a pleasure and a great experience to see how the Upstairs and Downstairs occupants ran their daily lives. What I loved was the story first, but the costumes and way the homes were decorated and conducted. Can't wait until the the third series of Downton Abbey comes out in the American version."
1,What does digitally remastered mean????,"I purchased the first issuance of USDS when it first came out. I returned it five times only to find out that the glitches were in ALL production issuance. When I heard that USDS was to be reissued ""digitally remastered"" I was over joyed. I have made it through about one half of the series. It has been repackaged, but don't expect an improved picture quality. SHAME< SHAME A & E for a rotten reproduction of one of the best mini series of all time."
2,Sadly DISAPPOINTED,"After two decades since watching Upstairs Downstairs, I rashly decided to buy the WHOLE set!!!! As I watched the first episodes I realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me! The melodrama was a bit vulgar and VERY predictable! Later episodes of the set improved, but not by much! It was like watching a biplane that didn't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway. I hope you won't make the same mistake I did."
3,Magic Tent,"Easy to put together, however there should have been a tie or two in spots to help keep it lifting a bit on the edges. Size is great just wish it would stay together better"
5,Guy from Yugoslavia,"This is one of the most honest movies I have ever seen. True story (those who saw movie will understand). I have enjoyed the acting of all actors and the fact that they were natural whole time. This movie was shown on local Tv in Yugoslavia twice and I have recorded it, now I watch this movie once per month (ever month). My girlfriend also likes ""hev Plenty"" (yes!!!) and she ussualy does not like such movies so you know this movie is great!Best wishes to all ""Hav Plenty"" fans and to Christopher Scott Cherot.P.S. I'm currently working on the book that is in a certain way conected with this movie..."
4,Forget Other Reviews,"This is a wonderful movie despite other people's reviews. The movie opened to rave reviews at Cannes and many of the African American film festivals. Christopher Scott Cherot's portrayal of himself in an autobiographical role is superb. the movie brings to mind classic dialouge driven movies such as Blake Edwards ""10"". Its a very sophisticated tale about a writer who is writing a screenplay about his interactions with women over the course of a New Year's weekend bash. Chenoa Maxwell is wonderful, smart and sexy as his nemesis. A must see form true film fans."
1,Disappointed,"I rented this movie and could barely make it to the end. The lead character is broke, smug and downright silly while the women are nasty and materialistic. There is no one to like in this film, the acting is mediocre at best, and the plot crawls along. As badly as Hav treated Lee, I desperately wanted to see him grow a backbone and walk away from her. That scene where she cussed him out after he confronts her for causing problems in her sister's new marriage made my blood boil. I don't know any man that would hang around after being spoken to that way.I don't see how anyone can seriously compare this film to Love Jones which was vastly superior. Love Jones had ambience, rich, multi-faceted characters and the cinematography was excellent. The same can not be said of Hav Plenty. I'm just glad that this was a free rental."
4,What A Movie!,"I wanted to see Hav Plenty when it was at the movies but never got around to it - what a big mistake on my part. I started watching it on cable last night and must admit that initially I wasn't impressed, but something wouldn't let me change the station. I'm so glad I kept watching. Like other reviewers, I know these people. And the story, although hilarious, was so real. I loved Lee Plenty, and although I didn't understand his attraction to Havilland, I desperately wanted him to end up with her. Mr. Cherot, wherever you are, WE WANT MORE! Keep writing and next time, I'll make sure I make it to the movies to catch your next offering."
4,40 oz. of love (hilarious),"This was a cool movie. It was very funny. The main actor was broke, sarcastic, and going through writers block. Yet every woman in the movie was checkin' for him. I know brothers like that (lucky bastards!). I recommend this movie. The titles/lyrics of the rapper/singer's songs were hilarious."
5,Excellent Confidence Builder,"Excellent book for those of us adults who are timid about the water, but want to learn how to swim. I especially like how she has you practice exercises on land 1st, then apply them in the water. It gave me so much more confidence when I approached the pool. And I also recommend the ""swimmers shape-up"" exercises early on like she introduced as I found they really helped keep my muscles loosened up and avoid undue muscle soreness and stiffness after swimming. I also like that she doesn't assume the simple things come naturally (ie., even how to wipe the water from your face). I look forward to seeing how far along I can get with her progressive fitness programs at the end of the book once I'm comfortable with all 10 swimming lessons."
2,Costa Rica's Dark Side,"I was really excited to recieve this video on such a beautiful place. I have travelled there many times, and this video portrays a land I have never seen. The images are intense and graphic. I would never show this video to a child. The film-makers captured animal aggression and little else. They don't even cover most of the wildlife a person encounters there. They also do not show the beautiful variation in the land there or any footage of people at all. The image they present is of a wild and hostile land, which it is not. It is the rainforest, but get real!! It's a pathetic documentary and really narrow in it's scope. It's also annoying in it's attempts at humour. Hopefully, someone makes a real documentary there one day!"
2,"Slow, overly-complicated and frustrating","This book is for someone who likes slow-going, complicated plots and already has a good historical understanding of days of the shah of Iran because the author doesn't give you much historical context. (Eg., the term Savak figures prominently at the beginning of the book but nowhere could I find it defined or described. A Google search told me it had something to do with the Iranian secret police. Should readers have to Google their way through a book?). This is the kind of hard work that this book requires.Some people like this sort of thing. I don't. Tossed it aside after 50 pages."
5,Reorder to replace my copy of this which was lost in a move,Excellent go to guide to brush up on climbing skills if you've been away from the ropes for more than a few months.
5,Dare to take responsibility for your own health!!,"I'd like to recommend this book to anyone seeking to take control of their own health and wellbeing. This book is easy to read, presents facts and research data and provides simple yet effective and practical steps to wholeness. I found this book to be a real joy. Best of all the information it presents will be appreciated by those who follow the ""medico-scientific model"" OR the ""New Age"" model. An anecdote: I tried the ""5 minute healing technique"" for the first time just from the information presented on Ms Goodman's website; my sinus pain was immediately alleviated and disappeared after I did the technique two more times- all within 6 hours !! Many thanks to the Ms Goodman!"
1,"amateur cancer ""experts"" cashing in","""Dr"" Goodman has minimal entitlement to a doctorate and is certainly not a doctor of medicine. She has never treated or cured a cancer patient in her life (I'm an MD and I have).This is just phoney ""cashing in on the boom"".Jack Canfield should be careful who he backs.If she wants to pose in this domain, let her spend 6- 7 years getting a medical degree, not a ""recreational"" degree, which only requires submission of a thesis to ""peers' (which can mean anything, frankly)"
1,Whose idea was this CD?,"Don't buy it. That's all you really need to know. You can listen to the samples, to hear how awful it is. It was recorded by a single mike meant for picking up a voice interview, on a (...) tape. The performances are pretty awful. The interview is terrible - just an amateurish DJ becoming increasingly uncomfortable while Martyn acts like a silly drunk. If you had recorded this yourself off the radio, you'd just erase the tape. I've never heard of anything so poorly done, and so pointless, actually being sold as product."
3,"A noble effort, but...","Henry James' work is far too ""literary"" to work as a movie. In film, character is revealed through actions. As a novelist, James made use of more subtle devices. As a point of comparision, at the climax of the novel Catherine sends her beloved a letter. In the film, she chases after him in the street and then collapses in a puddle. Despite fine performances by the entire cast, and a rare sensitivity shown by the director, Washington Square is a rather static and uninvolving film."
1,Far To Dull... DO NOT BUY!!!,"I am a lover of all things period and this movie does have some nice settings and costumes in it, however that is all it has to offer. All the actors do is trip over each other and whisper little to no dialogue of not much consequence. One can barely tell what the story is trying to relate the dialogue is so scant. I am sorry but just having actors stare into the camera is not great drama. I wonder did this movie have a director? But of course, it did, someone had to purposefully make all these mistakes. This was a big disappointment and not even worth renting!"
5,Clear Look At The Mind and Spirit Of the Warrior,"Lovret does more than point out the tactics of fighting. HE DEPICTS ESSENTIAL TACTICS OF ALL LIFE, including business. Without directly stating it, Lovret details and clarifies many of the principles described by MUSASHI in his BOOK OF FIVE RINGS. So said, Lovret's work should be treated as a companion piece to Musashi's own. In 25 years of practice and study, I have never known any other writer to depict the mind and spirit of the warrior way so clearly, DEVOID OF THE IDEALISTIC TRAPPINGS OF THOSE INEXPERIENCED IN REAL COMBAT. I don't know Mr. Lovret, but I do know street-fighting better than most fighters ever will, and I do know the fear and anxiety of combat (for the streets and the military). I TRUST Lovret's words better than I do most others, for in reading his words I hear my old master and clearly recall my own painful lessons."
1,I couldn't finish it,"I love martial arts books. Eisler, Lustbader, Bradley, Donohue... I read them all. I recently came across some reviews for Te Waza and thought it sounded compelling. I don't want to come off as harsh, but it is really pretty bad. The story is weak, the dialogue forced, and the characters completely unrealistic and boring. The fight scenes are ok, and the main character is a bit unique (injured Judo star). But frankly speaking, that's about it. I got about half way through the book, and was having to force myself to read each sentence... a bit like swallowing a mouthful of Mylanta. Not something I was enjoying. Also, as others have stated, the book really needed a professional edit. There are misspelled words, typos, fragments, and other mistakes. My advice is to go pick up Barry Eisler's Rain series, Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, or Arthur Bradley's Process of Elimination... all way more fun than this was."
4,Louis Khan - Visionary,"I purchased this book after watching ""My Architect"", a moving documentary by the illegitimate son of Louis Khan who was on a voyage of discovery - finding out who this man was who was his father. He travelled to many of the most famous pieces of architecture that Louis created and met many characters who had known his father and who had insights for him. As a result of this I was keen to get a book with a record of the amazing buildings he created. This book gives a good mix of information, architectural plans and drawings and then photos of his more famous buildings. As is usually the case with Phaidon productions it was beautifully put together and good value for money. I would thoroughly recommend it."
5,Kahn Compendium,"The great value of this book is in the very comprehensive coverage of Kahn's work and in the excellent reproduction of many drawings and photos. Taking all this wealth of material into account, the book has an affordable price."
4,sony cybershot 7.2 megpixels GREAT!!,This camera was a great investment. the photos turn out wonderfully. better than a regular film camera and I have kept an eye out on simular cameras...price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price. the only problem I have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but I think all digital cameras have that problem. this is a great camera.
3,so far ok....,"I have owned Sony digital cameras before and this one is quite similar to those. The pictures have come out clear and the camera itself is easy to operate. There is one lingering question I have though, and as I am not very ""tech-savvy"" I may need some help from other owners of this camera!On the other models I have owned, you were able to digitally zoom into the picture and trim it. I have not been able to find the trim function on this camera. Does it even exist? In the other models you just zoomed into the picture and pressed menu and the trim option came up. If this trim function is not on this camera, it may be returned to the store because I need a camera that can do that!Besides that one little thing though, as I said, the pictures I have taken have turned out very nice and the camera itself is simple."
5,Great product,I purchased this as a gift for Father's Day and damn it was a hit..great balance of price and functionality.
4,For what it is,Simple and easy to use. Decent exposure. Zoom quality is poor but expected at this price point. You will need to buy a card to store your photos as the internal 16MB memory won't get you very far. This is no Leica quality camera or lens but it does a very decent job considering the price.
5,Sony camera,"Good quality, it's a Sony product. In fact, I did buy two from AMAZON (third party sellers). Worth the money."
1,STAY CLEAR!!!,"I was able to salvage both the counter top and formica AFTER this crap totally failed. It took several hours of literally picking it off in small sheets resembling condom latex. In some case, I had to roll it between my fingers. In fact, I literally blistered and wore the skin off my right middle finger with continuous kneading to ""roll"" the glue off. The directions were followed perfectly and as stated in other reviews, there doesn't seem to be a ""contact"" with this contact cement. The edge succeeded on my project ONLY because it is irregular and I had it clamped with various jigs and fixtures. If I would have relied on contact adhesion, this too would have failed."
1,This product doesn't stick,"This is the first time I've used this particular contact cement and it was a total failure. I have been using contact cement for over 30 years and Lowe's only carries this nonflammable product. Followed instructions, applied it to my Formica and waited the 20 minutes and it failed to stick. It was sticky on applying it but waiting the suggested time only dried the product. No stick. I am afraid to try it again so I will go to ACE hardware and purchase another product. Back to Lowe's it will go. Disappointed. No stars from me."
1,Its sticks great to itself,"We're going to have a competition to see who can peel off the largest sheet of this from a piece of rough cut wood.DAP has a lot of work to do to make this even close to a solvent base contact cement. Low VOC water base is great, but in need to work too, and this just doesnt."
4,Nice Chairs,I found these chairs to be very nice when they arrived. My only frustration was when trying to get the bubble wrap off I ended up scratching the legs because the tape was so stuck I had to cut it off.
2,Two women in search of a worthy man,"What are two foxy babes like Jean Harlow and Loretta Young doing looking twice at that lead male character, that loser? Jean Harlow is miscast, but looks good; Loretta comes off best, serenely beautiful. Men might like it more than I did."
1,terrible,"this unit overheated while plugged in, powering a small set of speakers. Very troubling. Burning smell wafted through our entire house. If we hadn't disconnected it, it could have been very dangerous. I do not recommend this adapter."
3,Gets the job done!,"Yes, it can be loud, however; if shuffling your cards is what you want, then this products gets the job done. We endure the noise because it cuts down on time for someone to shuffle by hand. Our last one lasted about two years with once-a-week usage so we'll see how long this one goes."
1,Boring game,"This game is soooooo boring i fell asleep playing it! The only thing good about it is it's replay feature which lets you sit and watch a firework show, but other than that this game has no objective. I never thought fireworks could be this boring."
1,This game is horrible,"I'd give this game 0 stars if that was possible. The graphics were pretty good, yes. But if you've played one level in this game, don't get frustrated about not getting far, they're all the same. I played this for 5 minutes, thought wow this is cool, played it for 5 more, and realized how much it really ...(stunk). Waste of $, don't let anybody pay you to buy it, or rent it for that matter."
1,P.O.S. game,"I rented this game a week ago and it held my interest for about 5 tries. It is very boring, there is no addictive quality to it, much like tetris, capturing the fireworks with the analog stick is a pain, and basically it stinks. I contemplated buying it a while back when there was no good games to buy (exception of Madden and SSX), but I am glad I didn't waste my money."
3,Very precise,You have to be very precise to play this game or you won't make it.The game can be very frustrating.
4,Looking for spirituality,"I haven't finished yet, but I think it's an interesting way to look at different approaches to spirituality. I would recommend it to people who like lord of the rings and other middle earth sagas."
1,Please save your money.,"This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going.I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.absolute rippoff."
5,FACING THE FINAL MYSTERY,Excellent. Very easy to read and understand. I would like to recommend this book to all medical professionals.
5,"Fast paced, exceptional characters and intriguing plots","This was an excellent series; one of the very best I've ever seen! My only regret was that it was over too soon. It's worth seeing for the ships alone, but the character Hornblower was everything a hero should be and then some; ingenious, capable, filled with integrity and daring."
5,Horatio Hornblower,"I enjoyed every episode of this well wtitten series that had a strong sense of period detail. Ioan Gruffudd was charismatic in his role and the supporting castwere also great. The early 19th century sea battles were exciting to watch. As the series progressed we experienced the developement of Hornblower's leadership skills and the loyalty that developed between him and his crew. There is honour and integrity, danger and suspense to lure you to not want to stop watching until the end and then wish for more.Well worth watching and owning to watch again.The quality of the DVD""s was excellent with interesting special features on life aboard early 19th century British warships."
5,Can't do better...,"...then just to say that I can't improve much upon the ""Most Helpful"" positive, Five Star review given before.I was enthralled by the series, and wanted to watch another movie right away as soon as I had finished watching one. I restrained myself though, and did instead watch some of the added special features.I now know why this series won so many awards."
3,Decent but the special features won't play,"I can not get any of the special features to play on any of the discs, either in my DVD player or my computer. For disc quality I'd give it a zero.As for the films: The acting is mostly adequate, the seamanship pretty much sucks. As one of my friends said, ""If a person from Idaho and a person from Minnesota can see what they're doing wrong, they're REALLY failing!"" But I'm a sucker for high-production sea adventures, which is why this gets three stars."
4,GOOD AND INTERESTING,"A FIRE TO WIN IS A NICE READ, BUT DON'T REALLY EXPECT TO KNOW WOODY THE PERSON. IN MY OPINION THIS BOOK DOES A GREAT JOB GOING THRU EACH OF THE SEASONS THAT WOODY COACHED. BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHAT WOODY WAS LIKE EXCEPT FOR BEING A SLAVE DRIVER OF A COACH, DISCIPLINARIAN, ABSENT FAMILY MAN, AND OBSESSED WITH WINNING. I PICTURE HIM AS BEING VERY SELF CENTERED, EGO TRIP, BRASH AND VERY ABRASIVE. HIS WIFE GOT HER OWN LIFE. HE IS VERY MUCH LIKE VINCE LOMBARDI IN HIS COACHING STYLE. I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SOFT SIDE OF WOODY AND MORE ABOUT WHAT HE DID AFTER FOOTBALL. LIKE HIM OR HATE HIM, HE WAS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL COACH AND DID A LOT FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS FOR A SOLID AND INTERESTING READ."
5,Excellent,"This item was exactly what I expected to get, having an intro to every single track that you can listen to before deciding to buy is a huge plus when purchasing CD's."
1,The Savage is Loose,Scenes have been cut from this movie. It would be great if it came out uncut and in a clean print.
2,poorly organized,"This book is well-meaning, but unfortunately it is very poorly edited and disorganized. It was so scattered that I could not make it through the whole book."
5,Great Book,"I am 12 years old and I just finished this book. It is a great story of love, loss, sadness, and adventure. You will not be able to put this but down. You will be filled with sadness for Tut (thats the main charaters name). Trust me on this review. It is a great story."
5,Performed as advertised,I couldn't believe it. When I took the fountain out of the package and hooked it up it actually worked with no problems. The only difficulty which really wasn't major was deciding how long to cut the hose. The directions lacked clarity but it kind of is easy to do just measure how deep your pool is the length you want the fountain to be away from your jet and the height of your jet from the bottom of the pool.I only have one jet and one return so it does put extra pressure on my pump. I bought it for my daughters bridal shower which was out at the pool area for mainly decoration so I only had it on for less than an hour. I couldn't run it all day. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. We'll use it again at parties and whenever we want to see a great fountain.
1,Poor Quality,The fountain shows a picture of a large fountain. This thing only got to be about 6 inches high. The instructions are pitiful and not helpful. The tubing is cheap and caused my filter to start leaking. It went back promptly.
4,Another gem by Christopher,"I bought this book because I have a son and there just isn't much out there for boys or men in the craft. I read it myself as well. He does a great job explaining many things that kids and younger adults can go through with their choice of spritual path. I like the fact that he doesn't use any language that is out of the ordinary. I hate when authors use every word they can think of to explain something simple, something that this book does NOT do. This book has many ideas that can be used for more than just boys and geared toward the younger readers. I also like that he chose to use some of his personal experiences within the book to show that things that may seem strange, really aren't that strange. I would recommend this book in a heartbeat. Or any of his other books as well."
1,Not enough info,"Might be exactly what I'm looking for. Too bad no info power used, input output connects, volume control. Just a bitty picture."
3,Ok movie,"Not as funny as the last movie"" continental Divide"" but was ok!! The first one and last one was the best. But it was ok.."
3,Neither,"Unable to accurately rate, my 3-D Blue-ray player would not play the 3-D movie. Not sure if it was the DVD itself or my blue-ray. My blue-ray is brand new but it mentioned something about updating the blue-ray."
1,Ice Age 3,I have loved all the Ice Age Movies and this one is just as good. I will be ordering the Christmas one and the last one. We got this movie and let me tell you that the cover was torn and the movie does not play. I will have to order another one and the grand kids wanted to watch it and I had to go to the library. This is the second movie/game that has been bad--Amazon.
3,Great Fun! ...3.5 stars,"The ""Ice Age"" movies are cute and funny, and just great fun! In this one there is adventure and comedy, and it is better than the second Ice Age movie (which I feel was the weakest amongst the 3). There were some really funny scenes, my favorites are when Sid is telling the mother Dinasaur that he is raising the kids to be vegetarian, and Scrat and Scratte's(sp?) tango as they were fighting over that nut! And when Ellie who is giving birth is telling Diego (I won't give spoilers) to push and he's saying ""you have no idea what I'm going through"" lol.So all in all, this is a fun movie that everyone can enjoy!"
2,Good movie base goes to crude one-liners,"Don't show your kids this if you're expecting the same quality as the first two movies. Instead of a well-done plot now there are 1.5 hours full of trashy lines, sight gags and overdone stereotypes. You would think it was done by a whole different crew. No life lessons here, just constant slapstick with sexual overtones. My seven year old enjoyed it because she didn't get the lewd stuff, but it got old for me pretty quickly. Just my opinion. This is the end of the run for me, and it's a shame, but I guess when you run out of creativity and need to bring in revenue this is what happens. Stuff like ""Oh, it's a boy!"" ""No, that's just it's tail"". You decide."
2,Not good 3D (the DVD version),"I did not like the 3D version of this DVD at all. It is not true 3D. My guess is that if you bought the BluRay version of this movie, that it would be much better, but the 3D on the DVD is not good at all. I think I'm going to return it.As far as the movie itself, it was fine."
5,They can't stop watching it.....,"So glad I got this DVD - my granddaughters (ages 7 and 4) absolutely love this movie!! They have watched it non-stop for three days! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet, everybody type movie. There is something for all ages in this one!!"
2,not truly 3d. I have 3d tv and it is not made for real 3d just 2d with glasses,This dvd is made for a regular 2d tv not the newer 3d tv's. You can watch it on any tv using the glasses it came with. Disappointed.
2,"mm,..",no me gusto la pelicula. y ademas compre un paquete q venia con una pelicula del universo y nunca llego..
3,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"Given the uninspired nature of it's predecessor, one would be surprised to discover how delightfully solid Ice Age's third (and, hopefully, final) ""dawn"" really is.Although the number of prominent characters crowds the film, often resulting in a depressingly slow crawl as the directors attempt to keep screen time balanced, the film, as a whole, is undoubtedly a more realized product that enjoys it's new reptilian elements.Simon Pegg is a surprisingly wise addition to the family, delivering the most consistency in terms of humor. The old trio, consequently, takes a backseat to the new stars, sadly being of little significance in the overall plot and it's eventual resolution.Still, the animation is satisfying, even in the wake of Pixar's ""UP"" and the primordial squirrel scenarios are as hilarious as ever."
5,Love this movie,I absolutely love this movie! A must buy! My daughter loves it and has watched it plenty of times since I purchased it.
3,Blu Ray version Did not work,I watched the movie on standard dvd and loved it but the blu ray for some reason wouldn't work or at least the sound didn't function properly. The previews were all fine but once the feature started it was loud and noisy and distorted. I returned and received another in exchange with the same result. I tested it on another LG blu ray at the store I bought my LG blu ray player from and it did the same thing. I then brought it in as a rental from netflix and same thing. So LG owners beware. The movie itself is the best of the series imo.
2,Poor CD quality.,"I am enamored with Cirque Du Soleil. I bought my first CD, The Journey of Man. Simply outstanding. I then bought Alegria and Quidam. Quidam is good but Alegria's quality is poor in various places on the CD. Especially toward the end when the daughter leaves the circus, from that point on the picture changes to a transparency of some sort. The picture gets darker and you can't make out a thing. You can still see the people moving but you can also see their shadow or outline of their body and faces. I was willing to put up with it the first time in happened it was brief and short. The second time it lasted too long and just ruined the experience. I would like to buy Dralion but I don't know now."
2,Not what you may expect,"Although it has a few performers from Cirque Du Soleil it's nothing like one of the specials you'd see on cable. It's a story and not a CDU performance. I was very disappointed. I had my three year old watching it with me and the first scene is a man in clown make-up who lies down across a train track, puts his head on one of the rails and closes his eyes. This with a train barreling down the tracks. He doesn't get squished but it was not what I was expecting. (I won't spoil the outcome.) My three year old ran out of the room."
3,Not as expected,"I really was expecting more performances and less love story, and the side story about the kids selling the flowers was not related at all."
4,Liner Notes for the Boxed Set,"I encountered this book when I ducked into a library on a sweltering day while on vacation. The title attracted me because of its association with Kirk. Lo and behold, it was about Roland Kirk! I sat down with it and was immediately pulled in. The book is mostly anecdotal which means you get to enjoy many ""voices"" but it does occasionally get confusing because people refer to people you haven't been introduced to and much of what is said is repeated by others throughout the book. It must have been a bear organizing the stuff. Still..Kirk was simply amazing and if you love to read liner notes on jazz albums, well this is like reading one giant liner note, worthy of a giant boxed set. Lots of fun and you have to be inspired by the man's spirit."
2,disappointed,"Like many other readers, I was quite excited to see a book on Rahsaan, a long-time musical hero. However, I can't agree more with the Kirkus review; this is one long, rambling book without focus. I'm only 1/3 of the way thru & may not even finish it. Kirk's is a great story but it's not here."
1,FEEL CHEATED,"LIKED HIS PREVIOUS RELEASES TO VARYING DEGREES.DON'T LIKE THIS. IF AN ARTIST WANTS TO RECORD FORHIS OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION, HE SHOULS KEEP THETAPE IN HIS OWN SOUND SYSTEM.WILL KEB MO, CONTINUE WITH THIS TRIPE OR PLAY SOMEBLUES."
3,Not his best.,"This is the album that Keb Mo himself refers to as ""that album."" While expertly delivered, it lacks the punch and creativity of the previous efforts. Great, wonderful artist, but you don't bother to buy it unless you already have the others."
5,wonderful period piece,"I learned so much about the early influences forming Eleanor and how the marriage with Franklin evolved, and I really enjoyed it. Though historical fiction, it felt like it could have actually happened. Enjoyed the scenes at the homes and costumes of the early 1900's and late 1800's. Well done in my opinion"
3,This is for Calculus One and Two,"This solutions manual is for Calculus One and Two. Calculus Three uses the Multivariable solutions manual. Forget using Maple software--I can never get it to work. besides, your TI calculators resemble Mathematica software more than Maple."
1,Switch and Bait,"Ipod cover ordered was NOT what was shipped. It was an imitation and not an original EZ Skin. It did not have clip, necklace or film to cover screen. I had no informtion to return it. Needless to say, I would NEVER purchase from this seller again."
4,"If this is POOR, I want to see THE ORIGINAL","This was a very good novel by Kootz. He described the paranoid woman very well and gave an interesting view from the AI standpoint.Not many characters, but they were very detailed. Decent flow, but bogged down at times; clearly a very early work in progress by DK. However, I gave it a 4-star because I am not a sci-fi fan and it made me want to continue reading.If this is the revision, I would love to get my hot little hands on the original version. Anybody out there know where I can score a copy? E-mail me please and make a friend for life."
2,Not a normal Koontz novel...,"What can I say? Koontz is normally one of my favorite authors, but this book...just wasn't up to par, even after the rewrite. In fact I feel the only reason he rewrote it was to through in some current names (such as Winona Ryder and Deep Blue) and to mention the internet. The plot was weak, but not as weak as the characters. The computer (who told the story) just babbled. I could cut half the words out of the novel and still not lose the story. The other two characters in the story were not developed. I could tell that this was one of Koontz's early works, I'm just surprised it got published (twice). The only plus this story had were the themes of male attitude towards women. Now this would make a good book to analyze for an english class, but not a whole lot of enjoyment."
1,Don't Bother Koontz has others that are a much better read!,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is definately not one of his better ones. It is almost a waste of ink and paper. Watch the movie with Barbera Hershey, it doesn't take as much time out of your life."
1,Demon Seed,Very disapointing. Not up to Koontz's standerds. Could not get into the concept or the story. Just poorley done. I would not suggest this book to anyone.
1,don't do it,"I am a huge Koontz fan. However this was one of the most painful book I have ever read. I did the Kindle version, and it was just page after page of not much print and or story. Interesting concept, but not my fav Koontz title. Sorry, but i can not recommend this at all."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Demon Seed might be the title, but that is probably fairly misleading. There is actually an artificial intelligence, or computer, at work here.The computer desires an existence beyond what it has, and as part of that, has a woman trapped, and basically, wants to have a child through her. A rather warped machine."
3,"Implausible plot, and yet...","the relationship between the woman and the computer in this novel is definitely intriguing. I doubt that this could take place in the real world; however, I will be wary of technology:) Read if you can stomach stories such as DEMON SEED."
2,Revision is not always a good thing.,"I love Dean Koontz but this particular book was much more terrifying in its original version. I just did not think it was ""believable""; all things considered."
2,Fast but disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book - especially the ending. Thankfully, a friend gave it to me so I paid nothing for it. It was a fast read but I couldn't wait for it to be over. I much more enjoyed Dragon Tears and would suggest that book instead."
2,Very Disappointing...,I love Dean Koontz novels. Perhaps I was expecting too much after Intensity? Sorry Dean...I didn't enjoy this novel.
3,it served its purpose,"after a week at the beach, i had read almost everybook i wanted to read for a while. then i saw demon seed in the atlanta airport and thought id get it cause it looked like a short book. w/ an hour remaining in my lay over and a 1 hour flight, i ended up on page 265. however, dont buy this book for a plot, maybe some humor, but definetly for a quick read."
3,Easy to Read,"I found this book easy to read and ending before I knew it. It's rather simple, and it should have been written with more skill considering the technology of today, and Koontz's writing skills. However, I still enjoyed it and let my imagination take over where Koontz failed."
2,SO VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I fell in love with the excellent film version of this novel. I can't say enough good things about the movie. It is extremely frightening and the wild plot is almost believable. I searched without success for years trying to find the book. I was jubilant when I discovered that he had re-released the novel. I became weary when I realized that he had also attempted to update it. The result - a pathetic let down. His attempts to merge the internet into the story was nothing short of humourous. The mighty Proteus supercomputer, an entity that held almost godlike power and respect in the film, was reduced to a teen voyuer pervert in the novel. It was too short, too ridiculous, and very disappointing when compared with the film. I'd LOVE to get a copy of his original version. Rent the film first, then get the book and decide for yourselves - but be prepared for a letdown. Koontz took a fabulous plot idea and ran it through the sewers. I think I stick with Stephen King next time!"
4,you need to hear this,"I've heard 'em live, I've listened from the floor, with a cold one in hand...they're as real as I need it to be...LPreston/author of 'Another Night'"
1,WHY AREN'T ZERO STARS AVAILABLE FOR RATING??????,"Maybe I should have known better, but hokey and horrible do not have to be the same. This is a four dollar movie in any department store."
1,Don't even steal this book. Pathetic,"No research, No knowledge of economics or the stock market.Not a clue about anything but the names of weapons. Other than the fact that guns go bang, he knows nothing about them.What color is the beret worn by the Army Special Forces? Is it blood red? The author thinks it is.All seeing enemies with perfect knowledge. Henchmen who do this stuff for what reason? This stuff went out with the yellow peril in the thirties.The main villian, who can plan this so called perfect crime, does a Robin Hood which would never get by the worst IRS auditor in the world.This thing reads like the plot of a really bad third rate action thriller movie. You know the kind, with the star who is famous for 15 minutes for some other activity, like some ex jock.The plot looks like someone found this book and decided that with a lot more work and some actual knowledge they could make a Die Hard movie."
3,Not really a how-to book,"The book is mainly devoted to showing various projects made by the authors. Very nice and inspiring, as they do wonderful work, but if you are looking for in-depth instructions or practical knowledge, this is not the book. Try Encyclopedia of Mosaic Techniques by the same authors, instead."
3,interesting illustration,"I personally liked the book, it is well designed and interesting colors. My son loves books, but somehow didn't pay attention to his book much. I have no idea why though!"
2,Derivative sequel,"This derivative sequel to 1995's surprisingly successful guilty pleasure Species, serves up loads of sex, blood, and gore; all of which can't save Species 2 from being anything less than the disappointing sequel it is. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger return, along with Natasha Henstridge as Sil: a clone of the half alien/half human hyrbid she played in the first film. She goes into heat when an astronaut (Justin Lazard) returns from a mission to Mars infected with alien DNA, and he has an urge to mate. What results is him fathering a bevy of creepy kids (which are delivered by their mothers in a very bloody way) as the body count rises and he and Sil prepare to meet up. Species 2 is a pure schlock fest from beginning to end, but despite it's excellent makeup and FX, it doesn't achieve the same kind of guilty pleasure feeling that the first film did. All in all, it's worth seeing for some pointless but well pulled off gore and nudity, but other than that this one's a turkey."
3,"Not as good as the original, but worth watching.","If you liked the original Species movie from 1995, you might like this one, but don't be suprised if you don't like it. I would not rate this as high as the original, but it is still worth watching. A typical sequel living off of the original success.Natasha Henstridge did a much better job of playing the alien hybrid in the original movie.The movie starts out with a 3 person space flight to Mars taking soil and rock samples and the rest of that stereotypical astronaut stuff. Once the astronauts return to earth, all of the excitement begins.If the choice is to watch this or an evening of sitcoms, then my choice would be to pick this movie, but there are many other movies around that would be a better purchase."
5,excellent,wonderful feel good film has been my daughters favourite since she was a child. Really lucky to get it on DVD.
3,"Fun, but small output","What a fun thing to have your own cotton candy maker! That's what I thought when I found this machine. The only down-side is that you are only able to put in 1-1/2 Tablespoons of sugar for each batch - which means you only get a small amount of cotton candy (and by small amount, I mean SMALL!) If you are thinking of this as a great addition to your child's birthday party - alter the theme to a ""mini"" - cut tips off of a Q-Tip and use it as the ""cone"". You'll end up with a big cotton candy mass on the cone. (everything is relative, right?)The other issue I had with this product is that it comes with a ""measuring scoop"" - you are supposed to add 1 and a half scoops - what a pain! Why not make the scoop a little larger and add 1 scoop??"
5,Item exactly as described; shipped immediately,These longer cotton swabs are great for getting to the bottom of bottles that regular swabs won't reach plus the swab is wrapped on wood which makes them durable over a longer period of time (since we reuse the swab.)
3,Too short,"As far as any dictionary is concerned, this one is a bit short. If you work in the legal field, you probably know most terms included in it. If you are beginning or do not work with Law, this may be helpful."
5,Good music to create art to!!,"It is amazing that some music gives you the power to create better art. This is one of those. I love the way Wynonna gives me the power to believe in my self and see that I can be better and better as an artist.Her music gives me hope, happiness and inspires me to take new steps. I create better art with her music! I hope many more will make the same experience's together with Wynonna!!"
5,excellent,excellent concert a tribute to phil lynnot specially by Gary Moore playing great classics and mean guitar recommended .
1,Lenox Winter Greetings Everyday 2 piece serving set,"I was disappointed with the quality of this product. The bowl was chipped and the platter had deep scratches. Plus the manufacturing of the platter was poor quality -- bumps and pock marks on the platter. It was advertised as new but it didn't look new. Also, there was no packing slip or return address labels included in the package. I will think twice before I order from another vendor that is not Amazon.com itself. I returned the product."
2,"Idog, not what we expected.","Idogs are cute but not what we expected them to be. We bought two of what seemed to be something so very hard to come by this past Christmas. Our kids felt ""so so"" about them. I think the advertisers just built them up to much. Over all they are cute and do light up well with music."
1,A problem that Amazon.com must deal with,"I bought this player on July 2nd because it had rave reviews. I recieved the player, gave it a test drive and all appeared fine. I didn't notice the freezing as MANY others have since posted until a few weeks later when I tried to watch a DVD. This is obviously a problem with the batch of players that Amazon.com has in inventory. Now I read that I have 30 days to return it. It's July 30th, and they better take the thing back or fix the problem. Looks like everyone has this freezing issue. I sure wish I was contacted if they were receiving that many complaints about a product. Hopefully they replace my defective DVD player!"
1,Problem playing DVD's,"For the price, I decided that maybe I would be lucky and get a good machine. No way. The picture freezes, as everyone else says, for about 10-15 seconds every 15 or so minutes. How annoying. It is impossible to comfortably enjoy a movie. I usually take the advice of the other reviewers but being the eternal optimist that I am, I thought I would be lucky and tried anyway. Oops. I learned my lesson."
1,Must be a design flaw,"Several reviewers have pointed to a problem with the unit freezing at chapter boundaries and also occasionally breaking up into large pixels. However, being an optimist, I figured this was just the few people that got a bad unit and there must be hundreds of others who have working units and didn't bother to write a review. Right? WRONG! I bought the XVN410BK's twin (the XVNP10S which has all the same stuff but adds multimedia card reader). It has all the same problems reported by the other reviewers. I'm guessing this is a design flaw in either the processor chip(s) or the laser/drive unit. Guess I'll be buying some other brand from now on!"
4,refreshes memories of the movie,"Do notice that sound-clips from the movie are included--some of the most memorable ones, in fact. This CD (with great music, as you can see for yourself) also has this added bonus. Well worth the buy."
5,beautifully realized samurai tale,"the marriage of hip-hop and samurai culture is perfectly realized. the characters have resonance, even when they're being dorks. i'm usually a sucker for the original VAs, but i must say i prefer the thoroughly lived-in english dub - even better than cowboy bebop's (i see spike, but hear mugen.). SC's a gorgeous, frisky and deeply humane series. (as far as the dvd series goes, i would've liked more meaty extras)"
5,amazing,"This show is amazing. It has a great plot, with memorable characters, and a unique anime art style. This DVD has great video quality. So yeah, buy it!"
5,Just Freakin' Awesome!,"I, honestly, cannot express how awesome this series is. I'm a low level anime fan; I love it, but I definitely can't keep up with all the anime, and all the Hollywood live action, along with the independent films out there. Note to self: find review services that I can agree with and that cover all three areas *sigh*I caught this while I was in college, and I was up nights, watching Cartoon Network. I was hooked...HOOKED! I'm really not into Dragonball Z, or Naruto...I saw older classics like Ninja Scroll, and Ghost in the Shell...Perfect Blue. This is some really awesome work. Great artwork, well told story, great soundtrack, it's fun, creative. If you even like anime just a little bit, please check this out!...and now that it's on blu-ray, %$#! yeah I'm buying it!!"
1,Try Rurouni Kenshin instead,"Not that I hate Funimation ,but this anime is pretty dumb.I mean the doesn't make much sense how it went. The series looks weird/dumb,Mugen is an disrace to samurai every where,I didn't get the ending,and Fuu is annoying.Overall try other great titles not the corny ones"
1,Upscaled DVD for 2x the price,"As pointed out in several reviews, FunAnimation has pulled a bait and switch and passed off what is basically upscaled dvd's in a blu ray box. I find it insulting to pay premium prices for something that is marginally better than the dvd counterpart. This is not why consumers invest in blu ray, and efforts such as these should not be supported.At a minimum, please read the detailed reviews on the internet describing this problem at hi def digest and asian blu ray guide"
4,a great help in creating photo note cards with verses without a photo printer,I have found these full-sheet labels to be quite useful. I would buy them again when I have my next project underway.
2,If you love texas hold em' you just may hate this game,"I recently ordered this game to work on hold em when I dont have a chance to play with. This game is slow paced and frustrating. I wish that they used more buttons to help with options like all in and folding. It does have a wide variety of card games. But, overall I did not enjoy this game and it will collect dust on my shelf."
2,Speed for it's own sake...,"and that's pretty much it. Not to mention that the riffs are VERY reminiscent of Morbid angel's riffs, which personally turns me off as I am not a fan of their music. I do admire their bludgeoning agression but having also listened to Ageless venomous and Conquerors of Armageddon, I have come to the conclusion that Krisiun is a repetitive, mediocre band distinguished only by their speed. That is all."
4,Great disk for the practicing guitarist.,If you play classical guitar buy the Jeffery's complete works of Sor. And then buy all of the naxos Sor titles you can. You will not want for Good listening and challenging music.
1,don't waste your money,the reception is NOT great. the ear piece is NOT comfortable. the dial is NOT sensitive. it's very cheap
4,good b-sides,"The version of Music is My Radar included here is the radio edit, meaning that there's about two minutes shaved off of the lp version, which isn't bad... Black Book is a long, ""spacey"" kinda song and one of the band's better b-sides... Into Another is an amazing song from a BBC session back in the Leisure era and it is really good. You'll want to hear this if your a fan of the first couple blur albums."
3,GOOD B MOVIE,"GOOD B MOVIE. NAKED CHICKS ,COMEDY, GORE, ALL THE STAPLES FOR A GOOD LAUGH. ITS PART OFA SERIES THAT ARE ALSO B"
4,A good overall book,"I found this book very helpful and attuned to the questions that appeared on the GRE. There were a few errors but nothing compared to Princeton Review (of which I counted so many I stopped keeping track). They focus on a few things that never appeared on any sample tests or on my GRE (Standard Deviation, etc.) I would suggest coupling this book with a more specific book focusing on your weakest area. For me math is my weak point so I used The Ultimate Math Refresher (a highly recommended book). All in all, this is a good core study book."
5,Organized and Clearly Presented,"I started my studying with the 50-list vocabs in the book. I really like how they have a sentence for each word, which is useful for helping students to asnwer analogy questions. The book also contains comprehensive review of the strategies students should take going into the test. The book, so far, has been excellent."
3,No good for the math section,"I used this book as well as the CD to study for both sections of the test. It definitely helped with the verbal section - the word list is great!The math part, however, is a whole different ball game. The math questions in this book are extremely easy and I got consistent high-700's scores on the practice tests. On the real GRE, however, the questions were MUCH more difficult and I ended up getting in the low 700's and making LOTS of guesses. This book is simply way too easy and does not reflect the more time-consuming problems on the GRE. Due to this fault, I was unprepared and may have to take the test again. Thanks a lot, Barron's :("
4,Poorly packaged - broken dishes on three shipments,We love the dishes but after two shipments with multiple broken dishes I was getting a little annoyed. I filed a mild complaint with Amazon and they let me keep the second shipment with several broken bowls and sent a third set. It was received with various broken plates and bowls but I was able to make a full set from two shipments - and a few spare pieces left over.The dishes themselves are very nice and the mugs are perfect. I like the fact that Pfalzgraff offers a wide range of open stock accessories.Kudos to Amazon for their great customer support.
3,This used to be free,"A few years ago, I downloaded the pdf from the near.death.com website and did not have to pay for it."
2,waste of money-waste of time,"I have read almost every NDE book out there. Lots of really excellent ones out there...this book is not one of them. it is a below average compilation..found that I skimmed through a good deal of the book because it told me nothing new and took out the parts that are really interesting, namely each individual's personal account of their NDE.If you want to read good reports, read Betty Eadie, Raymond Moody, almost any book is better than this one. would love my money back."
2,Don't Recommend To Christians,"The reason I didn't like this book that much is because instead of the people talking about Jesus, they talk about other kinds of religions like Islam, Buddah, etc. When I first bought the book, I thought it would it was Christian NDE's. I thought it would talk about how people who almost died, saw Jesus and would explain their experiences. But I was wrong. I don't recommend this book to Christians. You will be dissapointed. The author of the book declares that ""all"" religions are the truth"" and that no one way is the right way. He also says alot of things are acceptable that the Bible says isn't like homosexuality. This just wasn't that good of a book. Sure, some of the NDE's were good because Jesus was actually talked about, but don't waste your time with this one, unless you have the same viewpoints of the author and think ""everything"" is the truth.NOTE: John 14:6 Jesus answered, ""I am the WAY and the TRUTH and the LIFE. No one comes to the Father except through me."
4,"very helpful, I'm a convert to the LDS but had some question this helped me!!!",I am a convert to the LDS church but never got alot of info this help to clear up some question I had and am now even a stronger believer of the LDS church...
1,You would have to be an Idiot. . .,"...to believe this garbage. It's a shame that the author doesn't mention Kolob - the planet where the mormon's god had celestial whoppie with his physical bride (yes, you read that correctly). His belief that the mormon's are a ""christian"" religion is an affront to reality. Avoid this nonsense at all costs - unless, of course, you need a very good laugh."
2,Not as described,"Jello mold was the right shape, but was not blue. The color really doesn't make a difference when it comes down to it, but I don't like receiving something different than described."
5,great watch,"I have had the watch for a few months and like it very much. The watch is accurate and sturdy. It does have a few negatives, like being a bit too bulky, having to change the date of the month almost every month and difficulty with setting it to second."
3,The book isn't out yet,"Every one of the raves and slops posted above is externally motivated, because the book is not out yet."
5,This rules!,"Whether Holmes knows it or not, he's a poet working in the medium of song. This is the best yet from The Floating Men (and the others are fantastic, so the bar is set pretty damn high). The harmony and lyrics are actually so good they catch you by surprise. Even after listening a thousand times, I'll find a little ""treat"" in the turn of a chord or variation in a chorus that I've always missed before. The songs are just that rich. Buy this record!"
5,one of the best albums i have heard in the nineties!!!!,"the floating men are truly a great band. from the minute i heard the first song on this album, i was hooked, its a shame they dont tour more so more people could see them live."
5,In A Category By Itself,"The sheer loveliness of the prose in The Haiku Apprentice makes this such a delight. Side by side, we stroll through Japan with Friedman, as she (we) realise that haiku is not just poetry but ""a way"". Other reviewers have supplied details, however, a few quotes struck me and made me relax in my own endeavours; from Momoko, her Master: ""Why would you expect your first haiku about your stone lantern to succeed...After you write a hundred haiku about your lantern, maybe then a good one will emerge."" Or Mr. Furuhata -""So maybe the seasons speak to us more than any spiritual concept could."" (importance of kigo) Finally, the purpose of haiku explained by ""Traveling Tree Man"" - "" He explained how devoting himself to haiku had led him to change the way he approached life - now he took all the small corners of the world that presented themselves to him on their own terms."" Whatever your involvement with haiku, The Haiku Apprentice is an excellent read. Highly recommended!"
3,Intervention- then and now,"The DVD has excellent content for any Intervention fan... however, be forwarned... it only has 4 episodes."
1,Terrible Hose,"I bought this hose after reading the other positive reviews. However, I found this hose to be terrible. It constantly kinks--both when it was brand new and after being left in the sun to help soften the plastic. This hose was practically unusable and I replaced with a NeverKink hose from Lowe's. The NeverKink hose has worked very well and, unlike this hose, it rarely if ever kinks. Don't waste your time and money on this product."
2,Keep Looking,"I bought this item on sale at a local hardware store. Price was a tad less than Amazon's. I got it just to wash the dog. So, hooked it up to the faucet, and I truly expected it to burst. It didn't, but the amount of ""inflation"" was hard to believe. Where I had the nozzle attached, it was a good 1/2"" larger than the fitting.re: kink free - NOT! I unrolled the hose from it's coiled shipping state. As in, spun the spool to remove any twists from the hose lay. When I applied pressure, it just seemed to want to twist. Literally turned 3 or 4 twists just from the pressure. It seems to me the reinforcement mesh is laid in such a way that pressure causes it to twist. Just my observation.Brass ends. Both seem pretty thin, esp the female end. I would not want to step on it with hard soles on blacktop, say nothing of running over it with a car.Holds water - didn't leak, did the job (washed the dog), but I wish I had spent a bit more for a better product."
5,Awesome hose!,"I am from a small town and when summer is over they put EVERYTHING away that has to do with the season. I needed a garden hose! So, as usual I went to my trustworthy Amazon site and did my research. After reading all the reviews (which I so rely on) I bought this and have not been disappointed at all.Good quality, strong water flow & doesn't kink up. I would recommend."
4,Pinches,works well but not the tightest seal and when moving around the hose will get pinched very easily
1,No screw fitting,"I was disappointed that this hose did not have a screw fitting to attach to my house's hose outlet. Instead, it had a brass fitting with plain metal, which obviously doesn't work for attaching it. What good is that? I am assuming this was a mistake or other people would surely have commented on it. I am returning the item to Amazon, as it does me no good.Chris"
3,Second hand kills me,"First of all, the watch looks great. You'll probably like it if you aren't bothered by the second hand.What looks to be the second hand is actually only used in stopwatch functions, so the watch looks as if it is stopped at all times. Only by noticing a small subdial that is the *real* second indicator can you tell that it is still working.Three problems with this. First, people think your watch is stopped and you have to explain. Second, it bothers me, aesthetically, to have a frozen second hand on the face of my watch. Third, I have to take a separate glance over at the small dial every time I check the watch --at least if I want to assure myself that the watch is still working, and I am compulsive about that, so I do.Kind of ruins the watch for me. Your mileage may vary,"
3,"Old black and white film, no subtitles","Because it has no subtitles, I recommend this production only if you are familiar with Don Pasquale. It's a black and white made-for-Italian-TV film from 1955. The performances are excellent, but the sound isn't always in synch with the picture. If you already love Don Pasquale, this is definitely worth owning for its great buffo acting and its fine singing."
3,ok but small!,It was OK product but it was to small and to short but it was made do with and it was very pretty and its meaning was set at it was suppose to be set as !!!!!!!!
1,Horrible material!,"Very bad quality! On the picture looks very nice and well constructed, but in real life looks cheap and not at all metal and it is too smal. if i could i would returned it but I'm out of the country and i can't now :(. I would not put it in my wedding cake i think the trash will be happier with this stuff than me. Don't buy this thing!!!"
2,ring guard,THEY WON'T STAY IN PLACE NO MATTER HOW TIGHT YOU GET THEM WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON THE RING. ALSO COULD NOT GET THEM SMOOTH AT THE POINT WHERE YOU SQUEEZE THEM WITH PLYERS.
3,Does what it says with pliers,I managed to use pliers to make them fit but the rings still slide to the back of my fingers.
3,Not without its charms,"I won't lie, this is a great read, but I'm not certain how much I love it as a crow novel. For starters I definately wanted to finish reading the book, and was interested in how it would unfold but I could also put it down whenever i wanted and that's not a great sign. I love the idea of having the influence of hell and demons throughout the book, but stragely this is also my biggest problem with it. If Attanasio had found a better balance between the demons and the crow, I would surely have to rate this book with 5 gleaming stars, but the the balance isn't there as far as I'm concerned. Don't get me wrong, this is still a fantastic book, but not the crow story I think I was looking for. In the end I must recommend this book to anyone after a good fantasy/horror read (Just don't expect too much 'crow')."
3,Goodman's sent wrong cookbook,"When my boss ordered this cookbook for me from Goodman's, they sent a different cookbook. I will be returning this book on Monday. If they won't refund the shipping BOTH ways and the cost of the cookbook, I will leave MORE feedback. The book arrived quickly and in good condition. It's just the wrong one."
3,Informative. But not a real page turner.,"This book was informative however, I couldn't 'get into it.' It was difficult trying to get through the entire thing. I got it recommended to me but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're genuinely interested in health and how the body deals with starvation. It seemed to be a thorough study that was carried-out back in the 40's which would be impossible to reproduce in this day and age."
2,Blind Faith,"Disappointing, to say the least.Poor sound qualityl 2 channel stereol I mean c'mon; no surround soundThis is 2006!They could have mastered the picture quality, as well"
1,Embarassing,"This CD shows that not anyone can play radiohead. This album is, simply put, a disgrace to the beautiful songs that are covered. If you want to listen to some Radiohead covers then I recommend the orchestral tributes."
2,Debut,"I had allways heard that At the gates were kings of gothenburg deathmetal but after picking up this album I began to doubt. Released in 91', this was maybe the first album to start the new wave from Sweden. It is not very good but it was very important for the genre back then. The music is not at all as advanced as it is on the next album. It sounds very dark and not as melodic as later albums. Yet it's a must have. At The Gates is a great band with many cool ideas. This Cd is not bad but unlike other bands from GBG, their debut wasn't that good. The developing proces from this to the next Cd released in 92'is enourmous. This is just a debut that sounds like a typical deathmetal cd of an okay deathmetalband. The next cd would be more complex and three times as good."
1,Terrible,"Please, don't waste your time reading this pedantic book. The author clearly thinks she is a superb writer, but unfortunately has a tin ear."
3,Sacrifice of style for story,"I do not think anyone can doubt the ability of the writers in this anthology. Moorcock and Mieville are wellknown and respected. The problem I had with the book is that crossing Proust and hard science fiction does not always work. The stories are all too wordy, and lacks in plot. Mieville and Moorcock almost pulls it off, with Mievielle's nightmare vision of a London overrun by mirror-images, and Moorcock's story about a post-apocalyptic USA. Maybe if I would be more familiar with Jerry Cornelius I might have liked this story better. Of course, the newspaper clips starting each chapter, tying the apocalypse to the Bush administration, did help improve it!So, what is my verdict? Mieville lifts this collection, but, you would be better off bying Mieville's Perdido Street Station"
2,Why Not To Buy This Book,"This book is very overpriced. The authors have taken information from earlier books and compacted it. How do I know this. in 1978 I read a very good book on Japanese Polearms that was about twice as thick and without the authors assessment of pottery shards. Unfortunately I borrowed the book from the Univ. of Richmond and it is very out of print. Secondly as a student of edged weapons I was able to see mistakes the authors made: such as showing a drawing of a halberd that they had determined was for parade purposes due to it's size, they do not mention that the halberd is either an import or copy of a Chinese weapon that was fairly common. They also do not mention the Japanese Battle axe which due to it's long handle should be included as a polearm. If the book can be found for a quarter of the present price then buy it otherwise do not bother"
2,unreadable,I was very disappointed with this ebook. It was so small that it was practically unreadable. The pictures lost something in the translation to digital. I had purchased this for my child who is studying elementary school level economic principles in his second grade. Loved the book. Hated this version.
4,Pretty Darn Good,"Good movie, a total Classic! I loved seeing it when it came out in the summer, and not just because the main character is kinda cute... (just kidding).This movie is hillarious, cute, and lots of fun. The characters stick with you for ages. Whenever they make a bad choice, you want to yell at the T.V ""NO"" (which, by the way, is a good thing, it means that they are believable).I really recomend it, it's a great movie that the family will enjoy. I highly recomend it.The only reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 for me is because the girl the main character had a crush on was secretly an evil villain at the age of 40 whose body looked like a senior in high school. If that's not weird enough, she turned all the adults into children, which was really disturbing. Other than that, this movie rocks!"
4,Excellent but a little rough,"I watched this movie with my 7-year-old son and found it to be entertaining and gripping throughout. I would have given it a five star rating if there weren't so much person-to-person violence. If you are sensitive about this type of violence, you may not want to watch this film. If it doesn't worry you, you'll likely enjoy this storyline which includes both some predictable and unpredictable twists."
4,Great Family Fun!,I give this one 4 stars for it's sheer fun. We saw this while visiting Denver and it turned out to be the perfect film for the adults as well as the 13 and 8 year olds. Lots of laughter and silliness. Always enjoy Kurt Russell as well. I am only suprised that more folks weren't talking about it. It felt fresh and still had a nice feel aside from all the super hero antics.Others may pan it ... we were delighted.
1,Can it get a zero?,"There was nothing FRESH about this!!! I opened the box to find a handful of dried, crumbled Thai basil. It wasn't in a bag or anything, it was just thrown inside a UPS box, no receipt, no attempt to keep it fresh, just crumbled, dried herbs. I threw the whole thing out. I wanted it for a specific recipe which called for fresh."
5,Best Ever,Rarely are leadership books so practical. Beyond Change Management is chucked full of ideas that you can put to use immediately. Linda and Dean get to the heart of what it takes to make real change happen. They're masters at offering easy to grasp solutions for busy leaders. In this rich book are a million dollars worth of consulting ideas!
4,Destination Moon,I have always enjoyed Deborah Cox music and think this was a wonderful chance for her to step out and do something different. I would recommend this CD to anyone.
1,Is the author a high school student?,"Being interested in the horror genre (slasher murder particularly) I ordered this book. What a shame. The writing in this book is terrible. If it was written by a 9th grader, I might think it was amusing and passable. If the author is an adult, then I'm disappointed. One should know how to write creative sentences (instead of short ones that add nothing to the plot). This explains why the author PAID for this work to be published. No publishing company would accept this. This book has the look and feel like it should be next to the tabloids on line at the supermarket. These stories might amuse a 13 year old (or someone equivalent mentally) but that's it. By the way, the font size is huge.. so not only are you getting only 104 pages.. you are getting 104 pages of big words. Avoid."
3,no any week window,"Great watch, nice and heavy. Super quality. Love the stop watch feature. Didn't realize that I would miss the day of the week window, which this watch does not have, but I can live without it."
5,awesome,It is a incredible watch. It looks better than the watch in the picture and is has very good quality.shipping was taken just 3 day!!!.There was a warranty in the box.I recommend this watch:)
4,built tough and nice weight,"For the price you can't beat this gem. It's the perfect size for me since I like large dials, and you need it to see the little details of the slide rule. It's a good weight, so it feels like it costs more than it should, and I get compliments all the time about it. It is also shinier and the polished chrome stands out better in person than pictures depict. I gave it four stars since I can't give it 4.5 stars. In my opinion 5 stars is perfect, and I am of the lot who believe that we should always strive for perfection but never attain it.Great everyday watch."
5,kiss and tell,"...(This book) is one of the best kissing books ever published. It's full of great kissing advice and for anyone interested in lip-to-lip romantic kissing, there just isn't a better book ..."
4,Living in the past.,"Perhaps I should have read other books by James Lee Burke before reading this one as he obviously has had a lot going on in the colourful life of his hero, Dave Robicheaux, which is touched on only briefly but which gives the picture of a deeply unhappy man. Dave's friend Catholic priest Father Jimmy Dolan has been savagely beaten by an IRA hitman, leaving Dave to try to work out the connection.When three teenaged girls are killed in a car crash after illegally buying drinks from a roadside liquor stand, the threads connecting the hit man, a town notable and the husband of Dave's former lover who is polluting the swamplands with chemicals, become even more intertwined, pulling Dave further into a morass of corruption, murder and secrets which threaten to destabilize this already deeply troubled man. It's a dark story but a very powerful one, and I look forward to reading more of his books."
4,"Good album, not my style","This is very good album and has beatiful songs. I am giving it 4 to be fair, but my personal taste in music would make it more a 3."
3,"Great Book, but Loaded With Grammatical Errors","I would give this book 5 stars if it were not for the numerous and often confusing grammatical errors that are found everywhere. The person(s) who missed these errors should be bagging groceries. This is by far the best guide to general economics that I have ever come across. The author clearly and effectively explains complicated concepts in economics and uses illustrations and examples that will help anyone understand this often complex field. However, this book is loaded with grammatical errors and in some cases they can confuse the meaning of what's being discussed. I am no expert in English Grammar but I know enough to be able to see that an abundance of mistakes were missed in the editing process. A new corrected edition of this book would easily get 5 stars from me."
1,Oversized sleeves,"I got this bar for my fiancee because she can't quite manage a 45-lb bar for many lifts. I wasn't expecting competition quality out of it, but I did think it reasonable to expect that standard 2"" plates and spring clips would fit over the sleeves. About 50% of my plates that fit easily over my other three bars would not fit all the way or even fit at all. Trying to fit run-of-the-mill spring-clips was an absolute no-go. Some plates will go on, but it takes a rubber mallet to get them off, and flecks of chrome fly everywhere. We had to mark which plates will fit on this thing and had to buy Lock-Jaw collars ($$$) for it. We're hoping that over time enough metal will get scraped off the sleeves and the plates that this bar will not feel like a frustrating waste of money. Caveat emptor."
2,Good size and sturdy....but,One problem.. the collars and sleeves have chrome that comes off when you put weight on them and remove weights from it...The sleeves scratched so easily by the 45lb weights that it is a common task to we wiping the silver dust off of the ends every time you load and unload it. It will get all over your hands... this bar would be ok if it was not covered in this cheap chrome.
1,Waste of Money & Time,"Bought two for my sister's reception. I fought with these things all night! I used the belgian chocolate, added oil - to no avail. After cleaning them, I put water in to test. It could not even pull water through!"
1,DO NOT BUY JVC,I bought this player and had problums with the unit. I returned it twice and had to pay shipping both times to send it to JVC for repair. They fixed the problums and low and behold now I can not open the dvd holder. Now they want me to pay for shipping again to send it back for repair again. I asked for a new one and they said no. VERY BAD SERVICE. Unit still does not work and I have now $75.00 in shipping cost too. Only one year old.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed. I was hoping this book would be a ""How To"" book, offering various methods of how to communicate with the dead...instead, it contained just one page of ""how to""...the rest of the book dealt with the beliefs of various religions and the authors personal experiences.We are not all as gifted as she is. We cannot easily communicate with the dead, just with thought.The book was disappointing to me. It had just one good page."
5,nice product,"fit very nice with my headers and valve covers. comes with four different color rubber holders for the plug wires. red,black yellow, blue"
3,ok but needs more volume,This item needs more volume to be used under anything thicker than a Kleenex. I finally wound up using it outside and on top of my pillow just to be able to hear it.
2,Older style better.,"Purchased the same brand 5 years ago-had to repair internal wiring several times. The new unit does not separate the speakers as much(smaller) and is ""rock hard"" to lay on. Probably a poor attempt at protecting the wiring. Would not recommend this product."
2,worked for a while,"You do have to adjust your head a bit otherwise its muffled. It took me a few days to position it correctly under the pillow. I put it at a 45 degree angle and it worked perfectly. However, after about a month of use its starting to die on me. One of the speakers is really fissling out, and the other one is starting to fade as well. Its more irritating than ""soothing"". I would not buy this particular product again."
2,"Ok, but not great.","It is not very loud, which is great if you have great hearing and you don't want the person next to you to hear it. You pretty much have to put your head into the pillow to hear it. It wasn't for me, I would have sent it back but amazon was going to charge me over $5 for the return shipping & it wasn't worth it. I'll give it to someone probably."
2,Hard to hear,This pillow speaker has to be right up to your ear in order to hear it so putting it under your pillow as illustrated is not the best thing. Suspending it behind your head on the headboard may work better.
2,Not worth the money,It only works if you are a side sleeper all night. Because I suffer from back issues I go between my side and my back all night. I was not able to listen the whole night through. It was not worth my money :(
2,Too uncomfortable to lie on it,"The thicker the pillow speaker, the more it hurts my ears to lay on it. This pillow speaker is unsatisfactory because it is very thick and the speakers have sharp edges,so you could never use it without the foam cover. However, the foam cover makes it even thicker and it becomes very uncomfortable to lie on under a pillow. After awhile my ears begin to hurt. I used it for a long time anyway until I found one that really works well, the C. Crane - Pillow Speaker PS2. It also comes with a soft cover on it, but it works best if you remove it from the cover as it makes the speaker much thinner instead of feeling like a lump under your pillow. Because the Crane speaker is saucer shaped and has no sharp edges you can remove the cover from the Crane version, and it is thin and smooth enough to be undetectable under a normal pillow."
2,Didnt last very long,I used this product every night to help me get to sleep (I suffer with tinnitus) so I could listed to music without ear-buds or playing it on a big speaker......it worked...for a while. They a wire must have broken inside it....because first the music quality got very crackled and garbled....then it just quit. Only lasted 2 months.
5,Great sound for the price!,I received this as a gift and I am thrilled with it. It slides easily into my pillow case and I can not tell that it is even there when I sleep. Now I can listen to my country music at night without my husband complaining!
5,It does work.,"I was very pleasantly surprised how well this is working out for me. No more earbuds all night long. My hubby cannot hear it at all and I sleep better since sound is not IN my ear all night. If I wake up, I may have to move my head a little to get back on the speaker. It is a greeat trade off."
2,Fell apart after 4 months,"Admittedly, I accidentally stepped on the speaker getting out of bed (during the night I had pulled it out from my pillow as it was uncomfortable.) But the speaker shouldn't have collapsed so easily, rendering that side useless. This was after the wires in the headphone jack loosened and rarely had a good connection - I used a rubberband for 3 months to keep it working and eventually had to replace the jack altogether. I loved these speakers but they just weren't as comfortable or durable as I would have wanted.I have since bought theSound Oasis Sleep Therapy Pillow Speakersand found the build quality to be superior; they're even more convenient because the left and right can be separated by as much as two feet. I would recommend skipping this one and trying those out for the same price."
4,Did the trick!,"I bought these speakers because I had been looking for a replacement for the uncomfortable, but high-quality, headsets I had been using when I slept. The obvious news--the quality doesn't come near that of the $150 headsets. However, there is no comparison in terms of sleeping comfort. I find the stereo speakers to be quite adequate for use when going to sleep. My husband is ecstatic that I'm not shutting out the world with my music when I go to bed, my ears are happier because I'm not causing them any pain, and I joyfully go off to never-never-land without any obtrusive wires dangling off of me. I use the speakers with my ipod, which I have plugged in to a charger, so I can play music throughout the night and wake up to a fully charged mp3 player. I'm happy as a clam that I purchased this product."
3,PillowSonic Stereo Pillow Speaker,"PillowSpeakers arrived in a timely manner. When first received they worked very well.After acouple of weeks the volume is sometimes off on different nights. Fine one dayh, too soft the next and needs adjusting. Still the best of the current crop pf pillow speakers for my Ipod."
2,"Great sound, but poorly constructed.","This stereo pillow speaker sounds great, but does not last. The wires used are flimsy and prone to breakage. My first set died, and I must now rewire the second set. Basically all that's inside are two small conventional paper-cone speakers. There must be a better solution."
4,Great solution,"My husband needs to fall asleep to music or TV, I on the other hand prefer silence. After many nights of compromise, resulting in one of us not being able to sleep, I went online searching for a solution. I looked at speaker pillows and they just seemed overpriced. Plus, I wasn't sure how comfortable they would be. I came across the Pillowsonic Stereo Pillow Speaker and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did, my husband gets to actually listen to music or movies at a decent volume and I can't hear a thing. If I had to to say anything negative about the product I would say that the cord is on the short side which can present a problem to those who toss and turn with their pillows, but this can easily be fixed by just buying another cord."
1,can't hear with it!,"dont know why but it is to low to hear from,the set volume is way to low,i put my volume control i got from amazon on it's highest level,with it on the bed and just my ear,it's just loud enough to hear,you cannot use this under a pillow.i looked at others before buying this one because it apealed to what i had in mind,i use my headphones alot while sitting up watching tv(i had a stroke and have to keep the volume up,but it's loud to my family)this was so i can lay down to hear t.v.,or music.one star because it's under par in quality!would let anyone know they dont make it clear that it has a set volume and may not work well for you!"
2,"lasted two weeks, though sound was good",It is too bad that there is not sufficient strain relief on the cord as it broke in two weeks. Returning the item. This is not recommended.
4,So far so good,"I normally wait awhile to write reviews, but thought I'd do this one anyway even though I've only had this for about a month. I've used it about 5-7 times now and the sound, compared to the one I was using previously, is great. Even more important is that it's very comfortable to use and seems well built."
3,Needs more power,"Fit nicely into my pillow. Sound was good, but lack of volume control is inconvenient. However, the biggest drawback is the lack of external power source. I have tinnitus and need the ambient sound all night long. I plugged this into my iPod Shuffle and it drained the power after about 5 hours."
3,Inflammatory Disease Suffers Take Note,"Newmark and Schulick have hidden the best of their message in the very last few chapters. So don't give up before you get there. The first of the book is largely a compendium of herbal knowledge. But, if you are a newly diagnosed sufferer of an inflammatory disorder some very good information written in easily understood language is hidden away in the back. It is a ""quick-read"" but a book that you will keep on the shelf to refer to if you are seeking to take control and understanding of your own disease. And not just for arthritis suffers. Those with dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia, fatigue syndrome, etc. can glean some gems."
3,Well...It's Hard to Say,"Back in the day of VHS, I suppose we would have called this a Video EP. It's four songs from two different shows. One is from about 1991 and features a very sharp Phil Manzanera, the other from a European show about ten years later. White Room, as if we haven't seen/heard enough of it over the years, is represented here not once, but twice (out of four songs). The other two are City of Gold and (surprise!) Sunshine of Your Love.If you are a completist, like me, you'll appreciate that the performances are solid, although the older show is clearly the better of the two. If the price is right, it's a worthy addition to your video collection. But it really isn't necessary addition and, despite being pro-shot, otherwise has a lot of hallmarks of a bootleg. I can only hope Jack sees a few sheckles out of this, but somehow I kind of doubt he does."
3,get the cleaner kit with the aerosol spray,This kit has a spray on cleaner -- which worked fine.but the oil is in a sqeeze bottle -- took forever to apply. Next time I will get the kit or oil with the spray/aerosol bottle.
4,Must have for the work a day Viking,Difficult read but well worth it. very interesting to try to follow. Alot of stories I had not heard before
4,"Great pictures, no Orange Bowl Coverage","The book offers a terrific overview of the outstanding 2005 PSU football season, including a highlight of each regular season game. It is missing Orange Bowl coverage, so beware of that. It's also missing a shot of Michael Robinson's infamous hit on the Minnesota defender, which was one of the plays of the year. Overall, worth the cost to remember the season."
4,"More selection, please! :-)","Alphabook is one of the many books supposedly showcasing recent innovative and original type designs, alongside with graphic images where the types are used and information for each typeface and its author. Although it's far better than many books of this kind, the selection of typefaces mixes really interesting and groundbreaking types with absurdly banal ones. However it's surely a book worth having, one of the view that provide (albeit) little information on the type designers and has some gems into it."
5,Great paints,If you are in train layouts such as me these paints are great for painting all your scenic areas such as rocks etc.
3,This boy can jam,"I,m a big jeff healy fan and he never disappoints. I don,t know how he does it, But i,m sure glad he does. I,ve got a couple of healy concerts and he really puts on a show. the crowds at his concerts are always blown away. You can never go wrong buying a Healy dvd."
2,Make sure it'll fit inside your cabinet door.,"This would be a great idea if it actually wasn't too tall to fit inside our camper cabinets. I measured this before ordering and thought it would fit. But you really can't judge how your knives will fit in it from the description. Most of our knives were too thick at the handle or too wide at the blade to sit down inside it fully. Therefore they would stick up too high and would prevent the cabinet door from closing. It was a waste and I didn't use it.I recommend instead buying a full knife set with holder and overall product dimensions, and doing some thoughtful measuring."
5,Thrilled to find this brand again!,"In recent years it has been increasingly difficult to find the ""Thank Goddness It Fits"" nearly A wireless bras in the smaller size. I could find only ONE recently in a major retail store! This is a slightly different model than the ones I purchased before, but I am quite pleased that it fits well and provides comfortable support and coverage. Of the three different styles I recently purchased, this is the one I prefer for every day casual wear. All three fit well but this style is unadorned, and has less filling in the cups than the 4111 ""Soft and Sleek"" style, or the 4131 ""add-a-size wirefree"" model which has lovely trim. If you are looking for a comfortable bra that looks natural I recommend this model!"
1,Not what I expected,"I'd bought one before at the Jockey outlet store and it fit wonderfully. The one I bought through Amazon does not. For some reason, the straps are way to short to be comfortable. I lowered them as much as possible, but it made no difference. If it's supposed to be the same product you'd find in the store, why does it fit so much differently? VERY disappointed."
2,"Disappointing, only a nodding acquaintance to SF","A marked disappointment, considering the traditions of the Nebula books. It is possible that they are good stories but a large majority is not SF (in my book). The stories do (in general) improve as the reader progresses through the book,however even the best is only mediocre. The long introductions are just a waste of space (:-), and to add insult to injury,it contains an excerpt from a novel, and a whole spiel (some 10 pages) about a Nebula man of the year (or similar). Buy it if you must, my copy is going to be binned."
1,MInd Body Over Price,This workbook is a poor value While I believe in Dr. Sarno and his work I derived little benfit from this over price book. Stick to the Mind Body Connection by Dr. Sarnno
4,Serves it's purpose,"This is exactly what I needed....A place to keep my PDA, Razor knife, Pencil and Sharpie. So far it has held up well."
2,Not very useful,I wanted this tool holder to hold tools for easy access but the flapper gets in the way...wish it was removable.
5,Custom Leathercraft Multi-purpose tool Holder,An excellent buy for an excellent product. I enjoy the fact that this product holds everything that is essential for making my job easier. I even had room in this holder for my reading glasses. It is also very comfortable to wear unlike plastic holders or hard leather holders.
3,"Well constructed, but...","This little pocket is very sturdy and well constructed. The only real beef I have with it is that the reinforcements around the mouth of each slot are too thick on the inside, and they tend to snag the items making it difficult to retrieve them. I think it could easily be redesigned so that those reinforcements are smooth to the inside surfaces. Also there is no elastic anywhere to allow for the pockets to stretch for different shapes.Otherwise, a nice pocket pouch for the price."
4,its a ok scope,its ok for the price but if you dont like relying on batteries to make your shot an easier shot get this it can see far enough to make your target wonder where you are. and its easy to switch if you got da scope holders so take my word for it its a decent scope and mine brung a yellow lens cover but i quickly got rid of it
2,"Not really a 4x scope, does not hold zero consistently!","At the time I paid [...] with free shipping which it is not a bad deal.I have a few 4x scopes in other brands; Winchester and Bushnell. This ""tactical"" scope in no way can called a 4x at all. The targets are too small on the cross hairs. Right now I am having a lot if difficulty zeroing it in, and this is not the first time in such task.My recommendation is to pay at least 10 to 15 more dollars and buy a better scope. The glass is way cheap, I mean the quality, and feels I am looking through a straw. Adjustments is too hard as well.The good thing is it is a small tactical scope, the pictures makes it look bigger. The construction seems solid and of acceptable aluminum grade. The eye relief is good and gives minimal glare, but my main grudge once again is it is NOT a 4x scope, maybe a 2.5 to 3x..."
5,Warm and wonderful characters,"This book is just the first of the Lizzie series. It is a wonderful book and is even good for teens. I got the privelege of meeting the author, Robert Whittle while on vacation in his home town of Victoria. He is absolutely endearing and is a wonderful writer. I can't wait to read all of the rest of his books. Lizzie is such a warm and exciting character and this story just makes you feel good! Very vivid....just takes you right there to where it all happened. I highly recommend it to all!"
5,Lizzie: Lethal Innocence,"I cannot recommend the Lizzie series written by J. Robert Whittle high enough. It takes place in the 18th century, in Yorkshire England, where Lizzie, an orphan is forced to use her wit and determination to survive. It's a book that a reader of any age will enjoy."
2,not an author children should read,"Mr Whittle is a skilled writer. However his fiction should be written for adults, where the problems won't affect impressionable minds.The first thing that disturbed me was the poor English of Quon Lee. While those learning English as adults might have difficulty pronouncing certain sounds that their native language don't contain, this would not be the case with a little boy. It's not true that ""Chinese tongues"" are unable to make the l sound, etc. Add that to the portrayal of the Jewish tailor as always whining, you get ""old-fashioned"" in the bad sense of the term.Then Lizzy was involved in smuggling, in effect stealing from the government & those obeying the law. Then blackmail. It's not OK to blackmail someone even when that someone isn't a good person.And I certainly don't think that people kept in a barrel would be alive at the end of a week. They either would starve, die of thirst, or suffocate. Maybe not all, but at least some."
4,Bow to Mike Patton........,"Tub Ring, MSI, etc. should all bow to Mike patton, Mr. Bungle and Faith No More for giving them a reason to live!"
3,Front cover a bit misleading.,"On the front cover you see a cat. There are absolutely no cats or kitten pictures inside the book. This was a bit misleading. The other pictures are good-a guinea pig, 2 dogs, a parakeet, a bunny but with a cat on the front cover I assumed there should be a cat inside. Be aware that there is not."
3,Exactly what it is,"This book is actually a re-release of a very old book, and when I say re-release, I mean that it appears that the publisher photocopied the old version and bound it into a book. This book is a great reference of contrasts in English, nothing more, nothing less. A must-have in my pronunciation classroom and my lab. But if you are looking for pronunciation help or a book on how to teach pronunciation, look elsewhere. This is a reference of words and sentences that demonstrate different sounds in English."
2,good looking but cheep quaility,"Should have known better, the first time i used this luggage with 40 LBS, the handle came off in the porter's hand, I was sorely embarassed at the airport. That is what I got for going cheep. Would have returned it but it is not worth the hassel"
2,dissapointed,I expected a box of two filters for that price since there are two in the picture. I will not pay $18 for one filter again.
1,Short,"This is the shortest 1ft I have ever seen; the cord is about 6 inches long. I only needed a cord to go from the wall to a splitter, so the length didn't really matter for me, but if you need a full foot, you aren't going to get it from this."
4,progress spoiler,"Most of this DVD shows just David Bromberg talking and playing guitar. Finally on track 31, ""This Month"" he is doing a blues number with one more person playing guitar and a story that struck me so hard, I want to spoil all the suspense of that song by dropping the ending on you cold. I was only aware of a few of the lost chops that David Bromberg fondly talks about rediscovering after spending 22 years in Chicago trying to identify every old violin, but you should be able to picture the kind of progress that he is capable of making when the first verse of a song is about:The first time my baby quit me, this month . . .it is all about him, but by the third verse, she told him clearly enough, soOn The Fourth Time my Baby quit me this month,I was on to her jive.I packed my things and moved back to the country.I'm not going to wait around for number five."
4,Good Case,Jonathan Eisen makes a convincing case that cures for cancer and alternative energy devices are being suppressed. I had professors in engineering college tell stories of people who had been killed for creating super efficient carburetors or former students who had been paid off to stop producing solar energy devices. Well Eisen has put a bunch of these stories together. He even has a whole chapter on alternative carburetors. What I like about the book is that he gives lots of foot notes and references including patents. I don't believe everything he says but with the references I am free to check his sources my self. I think the people on Mars and the moon landing being faked are a little far fetched but he does construct a convincing argument.onathan Eisen makes a convining case that cures for cancer andalternative energy devices are being suppressed. I had
1,"Not linen, gauze","I ordered this shirt for a wedding. It says linen so I was thinking linen tableclothes, linen sheets, etc... but, it was gauze, more like cheesecloth-totally transparent and barren threads. One star for returned and got money back but, paid for shipping here and back. Shipping return should have been their money since it was clearly NOT linen."
2,Fancy White Pirate Shirt,"I do not like this shirt too much. It is not sewn very nicely and the fabric is not that good. After I got it home I decided that, I do not think this shirt is a very good purchase."
2,Didnt like the material.,"It was a sturdy material, but it frayed easily. The little material fragments kept getting all over my black pants so I changed my shirt before we left to our Halloween party."
5,Highly Recommended iSCSI Source for Technical Reader,"iSCSI is a new SAN architecture that combines two popular network and storage technologies into one. Many technical people found the IETF technical specifications hard to read, since it requires backgrounds from both the networking world and the storage world to fully understand them.As one of the iSCSI authorities in the IETF, the author has done a very good job in describing the technologies and the ratioale of the specifications one step at a time in a very detailed and organized way. This makes them much easier to understand by the technical people from two different worlds.I fully appreciate John's efforts for creating such a great works that will be highly recommended for the time to come."
3,Not Martin's best writing,"I picked this up after reading the three books completed so far in Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. I thought I couldn't go wrong with an author who had written those books so well. However, these stories were written many years ago, and I think it shows.I found several of them kind of, well, cheesy. ""Nightflyers"" kept refering to who had ""sexed"" with who, for example. Some of them seemed like stories I would have liked a lot when I was 14, but now I could see plot twists telegraphed from miles away. I did like ""Weekend in a War Zone"" and ""Song for Lya."" I could see the endings coming on these also, but the ride was more enjoyable."
1,A THIRD SERVING ?,"A previous reviewer wrote that Mr. Bennett's first two books on morals and virtue were wonderful, and could we look forward to a third serving? If we can it will need a thesis such as moral gambling or the virtue of pulling slots. For all his lecturing to the unwashed about morals and virtue, something is obviously missing. This joker's moral compass pointed him right into the casinos. He has no credibility. Yet this pompous, self-righteous baffoon still has the nerve to show up and lecture us on Faux News. Probably needs the money to cover the latest spread. A suggested title for the next book: The Moral Ass."
4,Cinderella's Rat,"I thought that this book was amazingly written for a children's book. In the beginning, a rat and his sister are caught in a trap, and the boy rat is turned into a stage coach. He escorts cinderella to the ball, and when they get back he finds his sister and then, she is transformed into a human, too. So that they can live happily ever after with each other."
2,Time correction,"1 second temp reading is completely false. Myself and second competition BBQ'r tested this thermometer with dissapointing results. Room temp of 84 degrees to glass of ice water 33 degrees to over 30 seconds. Readout is nice and unit seems well built, but 1 second claim is totally off. I would return unit if it were not such a hassle."
4,Makes hair shiny and style better too,"In addition to adding a little bit of volume, this will make your hair shiny and hold it's style better too. Unlike a lot of volumizing products, it won't make your hair sticky. Your hair will feel like it's clean, and you can run your fingers through it. I really love this stuff!"
3,LifeStride Malibu Sandal too wide,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
2,Only for the strong of stomach,"This novel is only for those who are truly desperate to read anything and everything regarding Michael Collins. I did so, and enjoyed a few (but all too few) good points in the book. However, the writing style is rough and somehow the characters are too cardboard to ever make you care much about them. (If you're interested in Collins, you'll care anyhow and that gets you through; if not, forget it!) And the thesis about Collins' death, which is a major point of the book, is more than a little improbable. Give this a miss and read ""The End of the Hunt"" (Flanagan) or ""High Heroic"" (Fitzgibbon), or even ""Terrible Angel"" instead!"
5,caller id,"This is a really cool caller id. It scrolls to tell you who is calling, or who called and the number that they are calling from. I had one for two or three years and when it quit working I bought another one that I am currently using."
5,yin electronic,"if moonlight can be distilled and converted to sound bytes it would sound like this. Tzuki means moon, and these horizontal beatless electronic pieces are comprised of beautifully arranged minor keys and pure tones. Magical, haunting, shimmering vibrations like fireflies in a dark forest or a mysterious glow under water..."
2,Truly for the beginner.,"I recently purchased this book (along with many others) to brush up my technical knowledge of web design. I was rather dissappointed in the novice nature of this book. There was some solid information about how to manage your time and projects; however,I felt that a chapter dedicated to setting up your internet connection was unneccesary. My two cents: great book for the true beginner (and by beginner I mean someone who has only seen a webpage once or twice in their life and has somehow decided to delve into webdesign)."
4,comprehensive,"X-ray diffraction has been intimately tied with practical applications in the study of the structure of materials. All the way to the determination of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, and of course, beyond that, to the present day.The book gives a thorough exposition of the theory of X-ray scattering. From the simple and early dynamical theory of Ewald to how electromagnetic radiation propagates and scatters in a crystal. Then there are discussions of dynamical theory of planar-wave Bragg scattering, And further talk on more advanced theories. Like how a spherical wave might scatter.Then many examples of applications are gone into, like building out X-ray optics, to be on an equivalent functional par with conventional visible spectrum optics. Much of the X-ray optical capability, like building monochromator crystals, X-ray wave guides, multilayers and Fresnel zone plates, is of relatively recent vintage; like the last 20 years."
2,1980's Triathlon description,"This book is basically a re-release of the book Mike Plant wrote 15 years ago. The people he writes about have not competed in a long, long time. Mark Allen is merely an up and comer here, rather than the reigning (now retired) champion we all remember him to be today. The author defends this re-release indicating that the only changes he has perceived are essentially the crowds, the bike technology and the advanced training regimens. OK, I liked reading the book to learn about the history and details of the race and now know my body probably could not survive the heat of the run. Nevertheless, I would have appreciated an update on this world famous event, rather than this attempt to cash in on an old work, with minimal input."
3,freeway madness,"The Pretty Things in 1972.... well if you're a fan of the band you know they have a tendency to change stylistically quite a bit. This album finds itself in the exile on mainstreet/thin lizzy/faces category. This is a good thing. Different for them of course but i guess it makes sense considering when it was put out. If you thought they were done after SF Sorrow, you were wrong...although its not the best....YOU NEED MORE PRETTY THINGS RECORDS MAN. buy it."
5,Love it!,"Based on the picture, I thought it would be a little bigger but it's actually a great size and very cute!"
1,Not like an eco mat and very slippery,"I was very, very disappointed with this mat and returned it. I slipped on it and also found the texture very unnatural feeling. So I purchased a Jade brand mat and absolutely love it."
3,They put the wrong picture for Acai and Coral,"As of right now, the picture they have for Acai (purple) is actually the Coral (orange). So instead of getting the orange mat like I wanted, I ended up getting a purple mat :( So if you're ordering, make sure in your cart that you have the right color. So Acai is purple and Coral is orange.Customer service is emailing me a return label, so I'll be returning the purple for the orange soon. I'll come back and re-rate this mat for what it is once I get the right mat."
2,Slippery Slope,"After 2 weeks of struggling with this slippery mat, I just gave up. Don't waste your money on this. I was very dissappointed and will not buy another Manduka mat- especially after finding a Prana one at my local store for nearly 1/2 the price that is perfect."
2,Heavy as lead and slippery,"I bought this mat because I wanted an eco mat and Manduka was supposed to be the best. I knew it was going to be heavy, but not THIS heavy! Also, the natural rubber seems to make my feet and palms sweat and I keep slipping on it far more than my old one. I find this incredibly frustrating and it takes away from my practice. I actually bought it as I had read the natural rubber mats were less slippery. Not the case it seems. I am hoping with time this changes, but I must confess that I've gone back to my regular yoga mat.On the plus side this mat is wonderfully long and gives good support. Sadly, I still find it fairly disappointing."
4,Nice range of ideas ...,An inexpensive way to get some good ideas for a variety of situations. The photos were pretty but could have been larger but overall a good read.
1,Leaks all over,"Don't buy this steamer. It leaks all over. I carefully followed the directions, but my counter ends up wet whenever I use it. I put a cookie sheet under the steamer to protect my countertop, and there's 1/4"" water when it finished steaming rice (15 minutes). Also, steam condensed inside the digital timer window, and now you can't see the numbers. AND it's very steamy, so that although you can set the timer for a long time, the water runs out after 30 minutes. Then you have to take the whole hot, steamy thing apart to add more water. DEFINITELY NOT USER-FRIENDLY. I am returning mine."
1,It broke in less than a month,"I'd only used this item maybe half a dozen times when the timer broke. It would still steam, but only for one minute at a time."
1,Comparisons are instructive,"Bocelli is to Opera what Kenny G is to Jazz. If you think that is good, you will probably like this CD. You probably also enjoy Wonder bread sandwiches and twinkies."
4,"A good tenor, but not the best","After reading many of these reviews, I feel compelled to add mine. I agree that Mr. Bocelli is not the greatest tenor of our time. Actually the ""Big Three's"" talents far surpass Mr. Bocelli's. The one thing that makes this CD worth buying is the choice of arias. I think these selections have made this a worthwhile choice for anyone who enjoys opera. Although new to the genre, I own several CD's of opera, and find myself listening to this one quite often. I do not consider myself an opera snob, but I do know what I enjoy with a glass of sherry or merlot."
2,Let Bocelli remain a POP singer!,"There is nothing wrong with indulging Bocelli's passion for opera, especially since his blindness precluded him from the stage career. But why exaggerate? I'm assuming that Bocelli is a talented pop singer (for I am blissfully unaware of what he sounds like outside of his ""Opera Album.""). But why does it also follow that he is a great OPERA singer? Why not evaluate his singing in two separate genres separately? Please, stop carping on SBM; and please stop referring to anyone who dares to be unimpressed with Bocelli as a snob. If a three-year-old came up to you and criticized you for something you did (something you're really good at: e.g., what you do for your career or a hobby), how would that make you feel? Would ""snobbism"" be the word to describe your reaction? Or perhaps ""professionalism"" would do better?"
4,superb Boccelli,"Mr. Boccelli has wowed the cultural and pop set with his striking renditions and superb tenor voice. while cetainly not a Pavoratti, Andrea ranks high amongst Italian tenors. I enjoy his voice and his strength of note. I recommend any Bocelli CD"
4,Good book - carries along nicely,"This is a very original story about a couple living around the time of the Kennedy assassination. One day, an older man (the wife's long-thought-dead father) arrives with a roll of film. From here the entire mystery begins. He gets murdered and the wife disappears. The husband goes on to Europe to try and find her. Full of dark Nazi, french-political history, thisis another very good mystery novel from Elkins. Good job."
4,Where it came from...,"Once upon a time, there was Australia, where prostitution and gambling were not officially legalized major industries in Melbourne, there were enough jobs outside these industries in other fields of activities for Anglo-Saxons-Celts at least, and there were enough newcomers from other places than England for a dirty low paid existence.This good old time between WWI and WWII has been depicted with a DVD extract of TV show ""My brother Jack"", at the time a revolutionary tale of ordinary people's family, not a usual Australian story of British adventurers, pirates or simply bandits -- Kelly or other no-ideology-attached criminals.And this work very much differs from usual Australian top-movies, where stupidity and sexuality rule (Bad Boy Bubby, Strange Bed Fellows for instance), among which recent ""Ten Canoes"" a welcome sound exemption is.I will not place this DVD on my shelf, but it is definitely of curiosity for trying understand roots of contemporary Australia."
1,The camera was used before,"When I open the Amazon package I realize that the Camera box was open, cause Sony seal were broken. First, I check that all accessories, manuals and CD are on place. Then I follow the instructions to set the camera on. I put the battery charging but the battery already was full; Second I set the battery in the camera and I realize that some photos were taken from a guy and a family. Then I check the photos' date I, there were taken on December , I took some photos to see if the camera works OK and then clean the internal memory. Until now I've take around 100 photos and the camera works OK.So My concern what it happens if I bought the item from Amazon, not from a reseller. So it is annoying that this kind of event happen in Amazon. Any clue what happened?"
3,Color grains visible in almost all pics,"Image quality isnt upto the mark. I compared it with my sister's 3 year old Canon (5 mp), and canon gave much better pic quality. In this model, almost all pics have colors going bad when u zoom in the pic to 100 %.Also images arent sharp. I get the similar kind of pics which i get from camera phones. This is my 1st digital camera and I am not satisfied with it.Esp indoors quality is poor even if u shoot at ISO 100. The color grains are visible in almost all pics. Also there 's no option to shoot less than 100 ISO.I probably wont recommend it."
2,Not worth with the money with several competing cameras,"This camera sucked.... I'll admit that while it captures fore-front details well and the face-detection works nicely, it certainly fails to create beautiful pictures without cloudiness or haze. I returned this camera and purchased the Casio Exilim z1080 10mp... wow.. what a world of difference.. same price, but much, much better product!!!"
3,Low budget flick struggles not to drown in cliches..,..although I've seen worse. Liotta is the reason I checked this out. I just saw him in BLOW with Johnie Depp. Great. But this one is a low-budget flick that mostly left me not beleiving in the story or the characters. Cliche stuff that was slapped together quickly for the undiscerning masses. Liotta's a likable actor and his charm is the only saving grace in this movie. I still wouldn't recommend it.
1,Spanish with a French Accent,"I thoroughly enjoyed Michel Thomas's intro French cd's. The Spanish set was a huge disappointment. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I think there is an advantage to real students making real mistakes. We can learn from their mistakes - many of which we might have made ourselves. The annoying thing is that Michel Thomas makes his students repeat their responses 3,4 or even 5 times because they are not pronouncing the Spanish words with a French accent. The listener has to sit by and endure the tedium of the repitition and the lecturing about the students' mistakes. Most of this should have been edited out.Michel Thomas Speak Spanish For Beginners: 10-CD Beginner's Program (Michel Thomas Speak...)I played a bit of one of these cd's for some Costa Rican friends who were hysterical listening to the Michel's accent. Not a purchase I would recommend to others."
4,Spanish CD Set,"This is a nice set for the price. It comes in a nice black zippered case and has a small card with key words that correlate to the cd's. The only negative thing is that Michel Thomas has a german (I think) accent. I may have wanted to learn from a native speaker. All in all, I'd order them again."
4,For Historians,"This is a vocabulary actually, written in French between 1750-90. It is believed to have been compiled by a Jesuit at a trading post in Detroit or Sault Ste. Marie because of its inclusion of Ojibwe words. This is a book for historians of language shift, not for folks wanting to learn modern Miami, because the words are spelled as if with a bad French accent and the compiler does not separate the Miami from the Ojibwe."
3,Cheap quality,"It was such a pain to assemble, the pedals never seem to want to stay on while it was screwed all the way through, the more we tried to fix it, the more it seemed to damage the metal and be worse. The bike looks nice, but the quality is really cheap and it is way too heavy to be practical."
5,Powers at the peak of his powers!,"I'm not a fantasy fan, but I love the writings of Tim Powers. The Drawing of the Dark is thoroughly original, captivating, and as good at it gets!"
2,Sophomoric at best,"This film is rated ""R"" ostensibly because of the off-color language, yet probably the only audience that would really see any comic value in it is the under-18 set, so it fails there. The gags are predictable and repetitious. The best I can say about it is that the leads play nicely off each other and both have good camera presences and are oddly endearing. If the filmmakers had cleaned up the language and snagged a PG or a PG-13 it would probably have fared better. It's not a bad film, just a brainless one."
4,give him a chance,"sure, malamud's plot seems trite and few could actually believe these events, but he does raise some valid points in apocalyptic literature. particularly engaging is the contrast between jews and christians and the nature of god according to each religion."
1,too dumb to be really stupid,"Here's one:""My brother's a professional boxer.""""Heaveyweight?""""No, featherweight. He tickles his opponents to death.""and another:""What did they say about the aristocratic monster?""""That he was born with a silver shovel in his mouth.""OK, there may be thousands of jokes in here, but not very many are close to funny. Also, if you don't know phrases like ""born with a silver spoon in his mouth,"" these jokes will be incomprehensible. If you do know the phrases, you probably still won't laugh or even groan, just sigh with annoyance like I did.I thought this one wasn't terrible:""How do fleas travel from place to place?""""By itch hiking.""But did you actually laugh? Me neither."
5,Reinbert de Leeuw Slow and unhurried! PERFECTION!!,Reinbert de Leeuw slow and unhurried makes this just a joy to listen to.Slowing things up gives you a chance to stop and smell the roses as it were.From my Middle aged prospective it's essential Satie done right!!If you want something to relax to this is it....if your into fast hurried Piano this isn't for you.This set can be had for a real bargain and it's worth every penny.Pure and simple
3,Giving me the blues,"I really love van Gogh, and I really love this painting, but the poster just wasn't that great. I don't know why it was the case, but the poster just didn't capture the blue sky the way most reproductions do. When I got it in the mail and opened it up, I was disappointed to see that the sky just looked washed out, and it didn't show up blue at all. I have other, smaller prints of the same painting, and all of those are better because they're more vibrant, like the original van Gogh is. Also, the way the poster was packaged was disappointing because the ends are nearly unmanageably curly. The way they wrapped it, unless you pressed it for days under a pile of books or something, it will curl up at the edges and not look very nice on a wall."
5,Great,It is very hard to get the Jonathan Creek series on TV where we live. This set came in perfect condition and we really enjoyed them.
5,Terrible BxW Film Made Hilarious by MST3K,"This is one of those films that would normally put just about anyone to sleep, but Mike and the robots really make it fun with their commentary. They point out the obvious flaws and insert a lot of great jokes of their own. One of my favorite MST3K episodes, another being ""King Dinosaur."""
3,Good Binocs,"These binoculars are good for the price. One thing to think about is the eye area. There are no rubber eye holders, so it is akward to look through. The viewing is clear and the permafocus works well."
3,Carole Lombard is the only asset of this film,"A film that is not THAT important. It is not even very entertaining. But it raises an important question about journalism. A journalist is only aiming, according to this film, at increasing the circulation of his paper no matter how. Here this policy is entirely based on a fake event. It is overdramatized and it is super-effective in New York. Millions of people react to the story in the most sentimental and sympathetic way. And they cannot be moved from their support of the poor dying girl that is presented in this story. It is a complete sham. And yet it works. This raises the question of the responsibility of the journalist and the conclusion is alas very negative. Journalists are opportunists.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,Increible Seiko quality. But not nearly as nice looking as the photos.,"This Seiko watch makes a great gift. It comes in a gorgeous deep blue box with the watch wrapped around a little white Seiko pillow. The watchface is every bit as impressive as the photos indicate. Unfortunately, the metal band is no where nearly as sexy as the photos would have you believe. The photos show a clear difference between the shiny and matte metal parts. In real life, the difference isn't so obvious. To be completely honest, outside of the fantastic watch face, I think this watch comes off looking a little cheap. So when you fall in love with the watch based on the photos (like I did), don't be disappointed when the watch you receive isn't quite so spectacular."
3,Great addition to Herbalife program,This product is a great addition to the Herbalife Quickstart program. It appears to help with the removal of toxins.
2,Quality isn't what I expected,"The product was very inexpensive, but I expected the ring to be a little more like the picture made it out to look like. When we first received it, I could immediately tell it looked really fake. The only reason I rated it a two, and not a one, is because of the price."
3,incorrect carat wgt given.,I was told the tcw was 3.8 tcw.there is NO WAY this that high.I tought it was illegal to give false info.if its not illegal it should be
3,Too glitzy and looks too fake.,"This ring sparkles way more then I would have expected and I thought it made it look fake which of course it is. I returned it partly because of that and partly because they did not have a larger size. I hoped it would fit my ring finger, but It would only fit my pinkie. I didn't like the way it looked there."
2,Doesn't look that good as picture,It looks really cheap in real. Just Like a plastic ring. The picture is a total deceit. Wasted my money.
2,Pretty fake looking...,"I ordered this ring as a present for myself, but I returned it because it looked really fake--it looks like it came out a dime store the stones are too big, the silver band is too thin, and it was sized too large. Then I had to wait ages for Amazon to reimburse me (which they finally did, thank you!)."
3,Ok for the price,It's a beautiful ring. A bit smaller than I thought it would and very light weight. But for the price I'd probably buy it again.
5,Excellet!!!!,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved it. She wouldn't take it off. it looks better then the picture. Shipping was also very quick!!!
1,Not happy,I bought the ring because it was pretty.I have not had it for very long.The band broke.The silver is coming off.I would not recommend any one else buy this ring.
2,cheap ring,this ring was very cheap and looked it. Yes i only paid 8 bucks for it but i paid the same amount at another place for a set that people really could not tell wasn't real. This ring immediately became a play ring for my granddaughter.
1,Horribly cheap in person,I bought one good ring for a good price here on amazon. This one looked nice and was nicely priced so I ordered it. It looks really cheap (can tell in minus one second that it's not a real diamond). I've seen nicer out of a gumball machine. Was really disappointed.
3,Looks better on picture,Not very convincing. Stones are cloudy. It is fake looking and silver looks dull rather than shiny. Will keep looking for fake fabulous.
5,Very Pretty,"After losing my beautiful wedding ring a few months ago, I decided that I was not going to make an investment like that again, so I went looking for something that could replace the naked spot on my finger. I ordered this ring because the price could not be beat, and I have received many compliments on it. I am very satisfied with this item."
5,5,"It's very beautiful ring, i like it!! The size is little bit large, but it's Ok and I'll enjoy it!"
2,Stones are small,"I couldn't tell by the way the this ring was portrayed from Amazon that the stones were so small !! I love wearing cubics but I like them big. If you are going with fake, might as well get BIG ones. I will probably give this one away"
5,Wonderful!,"You simply can't afford not to buy these tampons! They are so much safer for your body because they don't have any toxins in them. Pure organic cotton that isn't bleached. The skin absorbs what is put on it, what the heck to you think happens inside the delicate lining of the female body? You put convention tampons in there & your precious body is absorbing all sorts of horrible & harmful toxins. These tampons work just as good as the name brands without all the dangers. Check out www.ewg.org or the seeds of deception for more information if you have time and/or interest! One minor downside, the outside wrapping around the tampon is a bit noisy compared to the conventional brands."
5,DVD Burner Review,"If you're looking for an inexpensive DVD burner that performs well, this will fit the bill. I've been able to install on PCs with Windows XP and Windows Vista without any software or hardware compatability issues. The software that comes with it is good enough to get you started."
4,Healthy...but a learning curve,"These are a little difficult to use - there is a definite learning curve. Meaning - it is hard to push the applicator in so that the tampon expands. I have found that if I get it started a little before inserting, then it is much easier. That said, once inserted, these are comfortable and work well. They seem to absorb a little better than mainstream - I typically use super or super plus but these regulars worked very well for me. If you have some and are having trouble - don't give up! The health benefits alone are worth the extra effort."
1,Very poorly made,"I am so dissappointed, as I may as well just threw the $30 bucks out my car window for the two I purchased at office depot. They weren't hard to put together, and all of the pieces were there. But I used them for legal files and it was soon apparent it wasn't sturdy enough. I put 30 legal file folders on it, and it sways front and back with the legs slipping under and the whole thing caves in. After 4 weeks of being in place, and very little accessing the files the plastic pieces are bending as well as the metal. It might work if you weld it to the inside of your file cabinet, and only use 10 legal files in hanging folders with one piece of paper in each folder."
2,Tarnishes The Legacy,"I'm a huge fan of Verne, so I'll read or watch anything even vaguely connected. I was really excited by the title of this book -- it sounded very Secret Adventures of Jules Verne.The title is the best part of the book. This is a pointless, self-indulgent romp in a sandbox very far away from anywhere else. The alien presence is not very believable, and the conflict is not particularly engaging. What results is something that is a little bit of a curiosity, but a lot of a waste of time.Skip this book, it doesn't go anywhere, and still ends up back where it started."
3,"Great watch, iffy on the band.","This band is not the best quality it is not very soft on the wrist. Thankfully bands are easily replaceable and you are not just paying for a band here. This is a great watch, very elegant. Good for the small wristed fellows out there."
1,Stopped working within a week - defective,"Ordered the watch as it looked nice. After receiving the watch, was glad that I ordered it as it had a very classy/sober look in person. However, the watch stopped working within a week. Could have been a battery issue or something else defective. This is not expected from a quality name brand such as Seiko!! Have returned watch to Amazon and waiting for a refund."
3,An OK Looking watch,I didnt like the overall appearance of the watch. I think it was mostly due to its leather band which was a cheaper in look and feel. I returned it for a refund as soon as I opened it from the box.
3,Nice add to our camper.,This is a nice little add to the counterspace in our camper. It's adjustable footpegs let you throw it in either side of the double sink without it sliding all over the place. We're primarily using it as some additional counterspace to throw the wife's Keurig machine on so it's level and closer to an outlet. Works pretty good for that.
2,Not as good at the Tobacco Filter,This did not really remove the odor in my home but the Febreeze tobacco filter worked wonders. The smell wasn't even tobacco in my house but it was so powerful in removed all odors.
4,seiko watch,very pleased with my new seiko. all my friends are admiring it. i have about 30 watches but this is my favourite. delivered within 3 days. cant ask for any better than that.
5,Seiko Watch,The watch was everything I expected and at a much better price than I could find at a bricks and motar store.
1,Seiko Men's Flight Alarm Chronograph Watch,Too fragile - stem comes out too easily causing time & date issues - stop watch second hand moves when it's supposed to be off if I shake my wrist.
5,a classic - the best book I've ever read,"As with so many of your reviewers, I've read this book many times, loaned it to someone with a typically powerful recommendation, and never got it back. Now I want to read it yet again and find it's no longer in print. There must be some publisher out there willing to make this timeless work of art available again! It's not that it should be a classic - it IS a classic, in the finest sense of the word!"
5,Hanto Ho,It is a book I loaned someone about 30 years ago and have missed. I was delighted to find a copy when I had the urge to re-read it. It is a story that weaves the philosophy of a Lakota tribe so that it is beautiuflly understood - as much as a non-Lakota can. In these times it is an island of peace and oneness with the oneness with Mother Earth.
1,Can you read French?,I missed that little blurb about this being the French language version. This book is absolutely worthless to me.
5,Love MI-5,"I was lucky enough to catch this on netflix. I was shocked to see if released so early. The series does start to take a few twists and turns in each character plot. Lucas North is just amazing and will continue to amaze throughout this season. Fine acting, fine storylines and it is BBC. Love it."
5,Best Kids' Album,"Can't praise this one too much! Great music that both kids and parents love. We've had the cassette for 3 years and it's *still* our favorite. It's getting worn out, so we're getting the CD."
5,Do not waste time with other mops,"I really like this mop, I have the handle, several of the wetmops and I also got a fluffy dusting pad. All of the padsare washable so you can rinse them and do a thorough job whenmopping, I have washed mine many times in the machine and theyhaven't shrunk or come apart. The dusting pad is very largeand really grabs dirt from corners without leaving a trail.I have used the wet mops to apply a mop and shine product. Iknow I have saved money and time with this mop and the pads.I am very pleased with these products."
2,?????,We purchased ours sometime last year. We had a problem with shipping. Seems twice we got our drawer busted and had to wait on the next shipment. After all that was over and they where put in place we ran into another problem. Both chairs cushions only have particle board on the bottom. Both seats broke .My husband took apart and replaced with a better quality of wood . We haven't had any problems since. We also paid more that what is being asked now plus about $130.00 shipping. I expected better quality.
4,beautiful illustrations,the images and stories are perfect for my toddler. I lost the first copy and liked it so much I had to replace it
4,Yogo DVD,"DVD arrived on time - no problems. It is a good, basic DVD - easy to follow with variety of sessions for flexibility and strength."
5,very emotional,"For those of us who have lived a charmed life, this story of Antwone Fisher sheds light on the tortured lives of so many people in our world. I believe that we should be ready to cut them some slack. This is a great story."
5,A must read for all guardians,"This was an excellant book by Mr. Fisher. We were ask to read his book as part credit for some credit hours toward our annual requirded training for gardian ad litim volinteers in the state of Florida. I was very impressed with what he went through and how he fought back. I'm sure he still has issues, but he should be reassured that thousands like myself are trying to do our small part to protect children from what he went through. The only disappointing point of the book is that it didn't provide a follow up of the foster family,abusers,and more of Fish's later life. Perhaps that could be a follow up book. I was glad I read the book before seeing the movie, both were great. Thanks, Warren"
5,'Finding Fish' Finding Me,"Finding Fish was the best book that I have read in a long time. It is now my favorite book and my favorite movie. Antwone Fisher's writing was very deep and I could really picture the events through Antwone's eyes. I laughed, cried, and everything in between reading this book. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who could appreciate its greatness!"
2,"Sorry, I can't get past the gruesome details","For a story of redemption, I'm having a hard time getting past the gruesome details of the horrific childhood this poor boy has been subjected to. If you have a heart, I don't know how you could keep reading, while being exposed to these sad, and terrible situations. I am taking a rest to see if I can pick it up again later, and hopefully finish it. But I also ask myself - what is the upside of exposing yourself to such awful realities - you already know they exist ...."
4,Inspiring,"Finding Fish is a very inspiring story. It was truly amazing to read how Antwon overcame so much during his young years, and was able to make a great life for himself. Very good book."
4,Does the job,"I'd say that this is a good product. There is a big seam down the front, but it doesn't cause any problems. It's really stretchy; it will most likely fit you nicely. It doesn't provide much warm, but will keep the wind out. Breathability is ok. My only complaint is that the opening in the face area is perhaps a little wide when you want maximum coverage, but this is a trade off for it being able to comfortably open over your entire face when you don't need as much coverage. Overall: 4/5"
4,Great Balaclava Mask,"I use this for airsoft and this is simply amazing. The only problem I have with these are the fact that it has seams inside and out of the mask that bother my face a bit when I wear it. It's a great fit and to be honest, I have a bit of a big head, slightly larger than normal I suppose. It stretches down to the neck and feels very nice and not irritating to the skin. I recommend it for any use but if you're someone that'll be bothered by the seams which will hit our nose and mouth constantly, then I do not recommend this balaclava to you. 4 stars for its great quality however, the seams are a bit irritating and wished there weren't any in the way."
4,Extremely fast shipping,"i ordered my balaclava on sunday. i received a confirmation and shipping notice on monday. Today is tuesday, and i received it in the mail!!! EXTREMELY fast shipping. Yes there is a seam down the fron, but its no biggie. balaclava works great. so glad i got it"
5,"Great, my kids loved it!!","The book was a blast! I love the part when his brains fall out. My boys loved it. It was very well put together, and the illustrations were great. I got the chance to meet Mr. Graves and have our book signed at my sons school when they held literacy night. He had his twins Max and Emma whom he dedicated the book to with him, and they were adorable!!"
2,Kindle edition not a good experience at all,"The story is cute but I've got to say, the experience on the Kindle Keyboard is so awful as to be unreadable. I didn't even bother to try to read it to my son as it's almost impossible to read without zooming."
3,Cute book but not ebook ready,This is a cute halloween book w/ great illustrations.... got it for the grandkids. But it's not really a good ebook since the illustrations don't come up full screen (and too small) & the image orientation switches between vertical & horizontal so you have to keep rotating the Ipad. Get it as a print book.
2,Cute looking but slipped off my heels,"These shoes are cute to look at but an effort to wear. They are fine when you are standing still but the moment you start to walk, the heel strap slips off. Quite a bummer!"
3,Its ok,The cd wasnt what I was expecting it to be. Their was only like three or four songs out of the entire cd that are worth listening to.
2,not good,"This is one of few bad new bands I've encountered recently, and they released their album at the time of bands like Flyleaf, Faktion, 10 Years, and all those types of groups. Their style pretty much lacks any interesting components and the only song that really struck me as being worth anything was ""Cold (But I'm Still Here)"", conveniently a hit. There's better music out there, so don't buy this album."
4,The Melodies of Evans Blue,"Three years after this album's debut, I'm surprised by a couple things about Evans Blue. First, my first inclination is to tag this album as rock ballad. I'm bewildered by any reference to metal. The melodies of this band are refreshing.Second, I don't understand why this band hasn't enjoyed more success. Perhaps part of the reason is that it has been somewhat mis-labeled. Certainly part of their audience must be avoiding the genre they are in because of its generally heavier image.These are beautifully melodic rhythms and I encourage folks to give them a chance."
4,"Tool-like yes, but is that such a bad thing?","I'm sorry but just because a band has some similarities with others, does that make it some sort of musical sin? Not to me--This album rocked me and that is all I really care about. Let's face it every band has influences, and there are only so many chord combinations possible."
2,Mr,This product did not work as well as the Mid-tran and in retrospect I really wish I would have ordered that instead.
2,Skips all the basics of cubase,"It's a fairly thin book. The first half is about setting up and choosing hardware, then finally it gets into the program. It starts out with experimentation of some advanced equalizer settings. It skips all the basics of the program, and how to get around, what different screens do, etc. It tells you to start opening and tweaking modules without explaining where they are. Rather frustrating for a beginner to this program. It probably has some valuable info, but you should know how to get around the program before using this."
4,From hardware selection to Final Mix,"Very informative guide to the new standard of digital home recording. Takes you through hardware selection, eq, mixing, track management, and much more. One thing about the book is that it assumes you are a musician and know some of the terms. Also is very fast passed after the initial setup of the computer. Excellent examples included on the CD. I found this book most helpful in setting up my digital home studio."
4,Great toy for the little ones.,I got a videonow xp for my boy and a videonowjr for my little girl they are age 4 and 2. I got them for a good price 14.99 at toys r us and bought a few discs and the carrying cases. The cases really are not needed but the players are really durable as they have been dropped off of tables and out of cars and still work great. The pictures are little pixelly but the kids don't care. I did have to get some rechargeble batteries so I didn't go broke but the things are great for the long trips.
2,doesn't work,Does not work! Doesn't get past choosing A or B - just freezes. Don't waste your money.
2,Highly Disappointing,"I am highly disappointed in this product. First, the laser pointer does not work. Second, the presenter does not opperate on a ""plug-n-play"" type of system. The presenter is designed to operate only if inserted in the USB port PRIOR to start-up. So, I cannot simply walk up to any computer, plug in the adapter, and use the presenter. This is very inconvenient and I have considered returning the product."
2,Good product Horrible company,"The product works great, but I purchased it under a mail in rebate offer. I sent in the rebate (doing everything it indicated to do) I love rebates because they save you a ton of money...I do them all the time, my parents even have me do there's because I always get them done on time and right. I never received my rebate (and for the first time in years I didn't make a copy MY BAD before sending it in. They refused my rebate so now I want you to know that ripped me off, and they were rude about"
4,Great,"This is a great tool. I have used a couple of other presentation remotes, and this one is more comfortable, and I love the timer feature."
5,Great and easy,"This is a perfect remote. It is really plug and play - no installation - just plug one part into the USB and go! I use it for Power Point presentations and it required no loading any software or a driver or anything - I just plugged in an hour before my first presenation, on a computer I had never used before, and it worked perfectly. The laser pointer worked great from a long distance - bright and clean."
5,Logitech Cordless Presenter,Excellent for presentations! Easy to use. I asolutely love it and would recommend it to every trainer or facilitator.
4,Logitech Presenter--Simple & Reliable,"I keep running into people who say their new presenter gadgets are unreliable, so I bought the tried and true Logitech 2.4 GHz Presenter. As promised, it always works, first time, every time,straight out of the box.The only features I would have liked to have had on the presenter were the ability to start the presentation from any slide, not just the beginning, and the ability to jump to a certain slide number."
5,the closer,"I love this show. It is the best. I wish they were still on, It sure did not take me long to watch these shows."
5,Famous Words of Famous Writers,"This absolutely delightful book has been updated and re-titled The Quotable Writer.As the author of 113 books (including revisions and foreign-language editions) and over 500 magazine articles, I highly recommend this book to writers, publishers and bibliophiles. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.com."
2,One bad apple?,I've always considered Seiko products to be quality products. The watch that I got was not. The day function would not set. Sent it back.
4,Beautiful Music,This is an excellent collection of music from a number of popular films. While the collection is instrumental it would have been great if some of the songs were also produced with their lyrics.
2,Charlie Chan And The Curse of the Dragon Queen,"For all the stars in this movie I'm sorry but it misses the boat. It has a few good laughs,but not many.Maybe for kids but they might not get the story."
1,Stinker,The one or two funny lines were not enough to justify the length of this awful movie. I couldn't even watch it to the end.
2,Seller Super Movie Stinks,"This item was delivered promptly and in good shape as advertised. However, the movie stinks. I think they were aiming for a spoof (not really sure) but it just came out as hoky. Since I wanted to have a complete set of Chan, I'm glad it's here. But I did not even finish watching it the first time."
3,Too Specific,"The instructions are fine for each individual character that this book leads you through, but there is no usable instruction to use on anything other than that character. There are a lot of options and variety for drawing characters, but not the book to choose if you are trying to branch out to creating your own work. It really is a copy book, not an instruction book."
2,Not for beginners,"I got this book early on in my efforts to learn how to draw better, and this book was NOT helpful in that respect. It says ""Draw Like the Experts,"" but you already need to be somewhat skilled in drawing to manage the designs in the book. Also, it doesn't tell you anything about creating your own characters, it simply gives you a huge stock of characters to learn to draw like them.This book isn't horrible- it /is/ chalk full of characters, and has some interesting drawings. But, if you are looking for a book to help you get started, this is not it."
3,Good on its own - but worst in the series,"This book really isnt bad persay - however I HEAVILY recommend it's cousins""Moster Book of More Manga:How to Draw Like the Experts"" and""Monster Book of Manga:Fairies and Mystical Creatures"" edition.I own the entire series along with roughly 8 other how to draw manga books and I am most impressed by the REST of this series. Not necessarily this book. The other three books are put out by Ikari Studios and you can REALLY tell the difference in the artwork. Its rich and colorful where the artwork in this book is good...however...it's not the best in the group.My personal opinon is all. Overall the book is helpful but not a beginner book. More of a supplement."
3,Awesome Book But..,"The book I received, about a third way in was written in Spanish for some reason... The book does give out nice information and HUGE amount of examples. But I can't read about 1/3 of the BOOK! I don't know if this is the case with all of them but other than this translation error the book is pretty nice and informative."
3,Westernized manga,"I am quite disappointed for this book because the drawings are more like westernized manga i.e. shy high school girl has punky hair style, with colorful nail and weird sock. The illustrator is not japanese after all. Moreover, there are not much explanations in the drawing. Book is too thick and heavy so it's hard to hold in one hand while another hand is drawing.Only useful part is the last chapter which show you how to do the digital work by photoshop.For those who like to draw Marvel comic style, you may want to consider this book. For those who want to draw real manga, this is not the book."
4,fast service,"I am pleased with the service, and love the book. I was the editor who bought Norma Fox Mazer's first children's book,I, Trissy, and was so sad when she passed away recently. I couldn't find my copy of the book, but thanks to you, founda used copy on Amazon. Thanks so much!Barbara Seuling"
5,Poetic Carnaval,"The book is very fascinating and interesting. The argument is very persuasive and believable. There are minor mistakes in the book but they don't diminish the general flow and impact of the Gililov's theory. It is unfortunate that the Rutland archive is closed for researchers, thus it is impossible to check whether private papers of the first seven Earls have a watemark of a unicorn or not. I have written a PhD dissertation part of which has been dedicated to Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland. I can assure that all that Mr. Gililov claims the Earl has been (patron of arts, educated man, lover of performing arts) is true.I can very much believe that Rutland and his friends enjoyed their literary carnaval in the spirit of fun and joke."
5,Best Value for the money,"Copies tapes with the touch of one button to Disc. I can put up to (5) 2 hour vhs tapes on to one disc and save money and my valuable home movie collection of my children. The menu is easy to use, as I only have to press one of 4 arrow buttons and then hit enter to record and set up timer record programming. The picture on screen display is simple to understand and the record and sound quality are excellent. I was told by a salesperson at a giant electronics retailer this unit is made by the same company making Hitachi , Phillips and Sharp units , selling for much more. Lowest price Ive found. Thanks for the great buy Amazon."
4,Turn vhs to dvd,"Bought this for my mother-in-law to convert those old VHS classics to DVD for longer shelf life. Once you read the instructions, it is fairly simple to use. Quality of the DVD is based on the quality of the VHS. We are going to buy another in the future for our own home."
1,RETURNED TO AMAZON-TERRIBLE DVR,Who could possibly give this machine a good review? My boyfriend spent an hour trying to get it to work and then ended up on hold forever with customer service before they told him he needed to use 4X DVDs even though it wasn't in the manual. We bought the 4X and even they didn't work. What a complete waste of time. Amazon should write this one off their list of acceptable DVRs to sell. It's being returned to Amazon tomorrow.Nancy
1,Hidden Secret on DVD Speed,I just spent an hour on hold with Funai because this unit was not recognizing the 1X - 8X DVD-R that I had bought. Nowhere in the manual does it say you can't use anything beter than a 4X DVD-R. But when I finally got a technician he knew exactly what the problem was and I couldn't believe that someone would produce a machine with a limit on the quality of the DVD media. I just went to BestBuy and they had exactly one pack of 25 DVD-R at 4X. So this could very well be a machine with a limited life because no one seems to be making slow DVDs. I am going to recommend to my girlfriend that she return this unit to Amazon. My guess is judging from the other reviews that Amazon should add the 4X limitation to their product description.
2,The bad reviews are correct,"I was given this unit as a present. I feel bad for the people who purchased this for me; they wasted their money. I have been searching for DVD-R/RWs that will work in this machine and thanks to the reviews on this site, I now know what to look for. I have spent a considerable amount of money on DVDs that do not work. And, as another reviewer mentioned, my unit is now eating my VHS tapes. It is a good thing it is out of production and that Amazon no longer has it available."
2,DO NOT BUY!,"WORKED FINE FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS AND THAN IT STOPPED PLAYING PRE-RECORDED DVD'S, CONTACTED SYLVANIA CONCERNING WARRANTY THEY WERE RUDE AND NO HELP AT ALL. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SYLVANIA PRODUCT!"
3,Ok,"Here is what it is, a model dies and comes back as a fat lawyer. It is kinda silly, and a little offensive (Its funny the model is now a plus size lady?) but if you get past all that it is a decent show. I only watch for MARGARET CHO!! Not enough of her, and they seem to hold her back. The show would be WAY better if they featured Margaret more and let her loose to tell it how it is in our sexist, sizeist, homophobic, white male dominated world. They are really missing an opportunity here."
3,Challenging,"This game starts out fairly easy and then gets harder- you get a certain amount of continues if all your Trolls die, but then all your progress is gone when the continues are used up. There is no save feature on this game so I have been to the very end only twice and it took time and patience. I would enjoy the game more if I could save my progress and start where I left off.You pick your troll, (each having a special feature, you want to save the swimming troll for swimming levels) and then in each level you run around collecting things, but mainly coloring the area just by walking on it and especially walking all the way around framed areas, the level will not clear until you do this. Beware of dangers like spikes that pop up, deadly colordrops and enemies. You can throw pies (if you have some) at enemies and then eat them, thus getting rid of them. There are many many levels and the theme changes, it is interesting to see the new ""worlds""."
3,Not bad,"In this CD, at first I listened to KAWA NO NAGARE NO YOU NI. I'm a Japanese, so I interested in how Angela Gheorghiu singing it. After the song finished, I'm so sorry because she couldn't singing this song so well. I don't know about other song, but as a Japanese, I'm so disappointed. But, this disc's concept is very good."
1,Wrong description,The track listings are wrong on this description. The actual CD only goes through number 8. If you want any of the songs 9-15 be sure you get Volume 2.
1,Does NOT fit the 22-560,"I'm sure it's a fine hood -- it's just that the documentation is lacking in this respect. I gave it one star in the hopes that my review will ""pop up"" for someone else with the 22-560 who's considering this purchase and (like me) couldn't find the correct documentation. After I spoke to the Delta/PC tech rep for the second time, she finally discovered that the dust collection assembly for the 22-560 originally was part number 50-445, but it has since been changed to 5140070-54. (It's NOT part #1342183 -- that's only the dust chute itself, without the rest of the assembly). It's not available on Amazon. Go to servicenet.deltaportercable.com and enter the new part number in the search field. You can order it from there."
1,Downfall of a great Prima Donna,"I have to agree with all three of the other reviews regarding the poor vocal condition of Dame Joan in this ""should not have been release"" recording. Dame Joan was over 61 here, and her voice a meer shadow of the glorious sound she used to make during her legendary prime years of the 1950's, 1960'and the 1970's. Pavorotti is not much better. Alas, the great diva should have retired after her historic 1985 Convent Garden Lucia's. Instead, many young listeners, hearing the aged diva's voice here, is probably wondering in their mind, what phenomenal voice? The Emperor's New Clothes? To that new generation of opera lovers, I would agree with the critic from San Francisco who suggested everyone to purchase Sutherland's ""The Art of the Prima Donna"", and be floored by the most amazing singing on record."
4,SHORT BUT WELL WRITTEN,"I think we all can agree there is a glut of books on Titanic. So far I have seen books on everything from the iceberg's history to cookbooks taken from Titanic's menus. With that in mind, one should always be careful when selecting a book on the subject.Bonsall's work covers the history of Titanic and her two sisters, Olympic and Brittanic. It is very short, but well written and interesting even to someone with extensive knowledge of the ships. The jacket describes Bonsall as a top historian and the writing would seem to justify this description. I found the chapter on the Titanic inquiry to be especially good. The illustrations and photographs are excellent as well."
3,Yet another Titanic book,"This book would be more accurately titled ""Olympic, Britannic, and, by the way, Titanic"". It is a large, handsome book, with all of the usual photographs well-reproduced, along with some that are seen less often. Much of the book is spent on the stories of the Titanic's sister ships, Olympic and Britannic. Not the book to buy if you are only going to buy one Titanic book, but it stays in my collection of twenty or so."
3,Helped a little,"Bought this for my son. Was hoping it would ""cure"" the large flakes and itching, but it didn't completely go away. It did help a little though. The dandruff and itching are noticeably improved."
2,superficial and hard to cook. not an easy way to cook persian,"It seems she is more obsessed with adding more and more to food without getting actually the real taste out of the final dish. Ghorme Sabzi or Loobia Polo among most favorite and well known Persian dishes for Pesians will be absolutely different from what you would get from this book. I am not sure what part of Iran her recipes are coming from but it is absolutely different from main stream food and taste.lemon and lime are being used wrong from time to time. I am not happy about this book but it seems like more ligid source than online resources.again, to cook by this book you must spend all the day in kitchen!!!!"
5,Love it!!,"I'm Persian and my mother is an incredible cook with vast repertoire. So, I didn't start cooking until I went off to med school. I needed a beginners cookbook & this is one that leads to consistently delicious and authentic meals. The basics done well, with plenty of helpful tips. The glossary in back is also helpful. Would HIGHLY recommend to those learning to cook Persian/Iranian food. If you're looking for more avant garde Perisan foods, I'd try her other bookFrom Persia to Napa: Wine at the Persian Table."
1,Terrible Transcribing!!!,"I like Pamela Morsi books, and this book might have been more enjoyable to read if I bought it in paperback. I bought this book on my Kindle and it was very difficult to read. The transcribing was terrible! There were big spaces between words, one or two words in a line, bad spelling, and the paragraphing was off. Also, the older books being made for Kindle are way to high priced. They want the same price of the book as was when it was new. I may have to go back to paper books."
3,It's not that big!!,"This is a very nice journal, but take note--IT'S LITTLE!!! I ordered it thinking it was at least 8""x6"", but it's more like 4""x5"". Just wanted to make everyone aware so they are not dissappointed like I was."
1,Delay on the arrival,"The product itb was what I was looking for, but the estimate time arrival was shorter than waht actually happen (a month almost since I buy it!)"
5,Sincerely....,"Great cast, great script, totally camp with an underlying message. You'll enjoy watching all of the threads from the past weave this story. Check out the young Kathy Bates! Excellent performances from Cher, Karen Black, and Sandy Dennis. Definitely worth seeing!"
1,What's That Smell?,"After being swept away by ""In Loving Memory Of ..."" back in 1997, I bought this CD on pure faith and earlier reviews. With regards to this release all I can say is: This CD makes sulfur smell pleasant. I honestly cannot recommend a single song to anyone.I bought this CD used, and even at that price, payed too much. Don't make the same mistake.Interested in this CD? Cover the postage and I'll send you mine."
4,big album,"This band is very hard to cattagorize but they are extremely good musicians.If i compare them with anybody,Breaking Benjamin comes to mind, but Big wreck is justy a tad more refined and just a touch not as hard. decent listen with a wide array of sound scapes."
2,Mediocre.,"This wasn't the best PPV I've ever seen.It was pretty disappointing to be honest:1. After all the hype and build up, The Rock was in the event for about 10 minutes.2. No substance whatsoever. Most of the matches were poor, even Taker vs. HHH. 5 minutes of action, 10 minutes of resting, it was a real drag, not to mention the way the WWE over souled both their finishing moves.3. No atmosphere, no crowd energy.4. Backstage segments were increasingly bad for a Wrestlemania event.5. Main event was just awful, it got worse after the Rock showed up.Edge vs Del Rio was ok, but just felt like a RAW! match, the 8 man tag match lasted 1 minute and the rest of the matches were either too short or lacked flare.4.5/10"
1,"Pretty good Wrestlemanaia, edited music","There are plenty of reviews for the event so look else where for that, it was good not great. This is a short review for the Blu-Ray release only. There are almost no extras and there are edited songs on the disc. I could forgive editing the music on the lesser PPV's or on collections but for the biggest event of the year why couldn't they pay the royalties to get the real songs for the event or never use licensed music to begin with. I was going to give it a 3 since the HOF had my favorite wrestler, Shawn Michaels, in it and Wrestlemania had a couple of good matches including Edge's last and possibly Undertaker & Triple H's last but nobody ever reads 3 star reviews. Most people want to see what was good or bad about the item so they'll read the 1's and 5's. It's not a bad package if you're not bothered by editing but if it does and you don't care about the HOF just wait for your favorite match to be released on a future collection."
1,The Worst Wrestlemaia Of All Time!!!!!!,I was hoping that Wrestlemania 27 would requiem the WWE from the worst year of 2010.Come on The Rock being the host he's suck altogether coming back in the WWE the John Cena vs The Miz was a disspointing the match I thought was good was Undertaker vs Triple H this match save this year Wrestlemaia I give this One Star because WWE 2010 was noting more than a disspointing I hope 2011 will Requiem the WWE.
3,triple h vs undertaker.... one of the best 5 matches ever!!!,Triple H vs Undertaker... the best match by far in this Wrestlemania... Austin is a genius!!!!... but the worst Main Event ever!!!
5,"Sythesized muck... not hardly ""Lord of the Dance""","I bought this unlistened-to because of the ""Lord of the Dance"" connection - major mistake. The music here seems almost entirely synthetic, missing all the life that the soundtrack to that show has. If you're looking for something that recreates the feel of his music from that show, I'd recommend you look elsewhere."
3,Does the job,"This is not an elegant cheese board, but it does the job. I wanted a dome and didn't want to spend lots of money and I got what I paid for. It works well but the glass is rather plain"
5,Excellent product for the price.,Both the glass cover and marble base are heavy and sturdy. The marble base is more sanitary than the more common wooden bases. There is simply no way to improve this cheese dome.
4,Love it!,I ordered this perfume based on the reviews wanting to try something different. I love it! It is the perfect scent for the fall.
5,"""Plain"" Elegance 2","Purchased this with the Luigi Bormioli ""Chip & Dip"" set for a family member for Cmas 2007. She loves it. There's really not much to say about a candy bowl. If you are looking for quality and something that you can use with almost any decor, this is a great choice."
4,Great product for the price,"For $10, this is a great candy dish. It arrived in good condition and looks like it costs more than $10."
4,how to use your brain,"A handbook indeed, to be referred to more than occasionally.One of its major tenets, is that the source of most of our unhappiness is when the world doesn't conform to our expectations. It helps us accept what happens to us in life, not to be interpreted as throwing our hands up and surrendering to a notion that we are powerless to affect our life, but in fact its message is one of empowerment, whereby we act to change whatever we can, and doing so more effectively when we are free from emotional turmoil.The book is about how to free ourselves from this unnecessary emotionalism that many times controls our lives; to learn how to use the awesome biocomputer that is our brain and reprogram it to more fully realize your potential for a happier life.Joe ArrigoAuthor of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"
5,I love this cabinet,"I've owned this cabinet (in the cherry/black configuration) for a couple of years. It's a fantastic cabinet in my opinion.Currently mine holds:1) 67"" TV2) 2 x Tivos3) HD-DVD4) PS35) Wii6) Receiver7) XBOX8) Large power strip9) Stacks of games10) Room to spareThe wires are all easy to manage in the back with nice open spaces to route them. The sides and front have black metal grilles which allow for excellent ventilation and my remots all work without opening doors. It really is a nice looking unit as well.My only minor complaints:1) Clean it with care - the finish isn't glossy and it is sensitive to cleaners.2) Dusting is a pain - this isn't specific to this setup - but dust gets in easily (probably thanks to the great ventilation)3) Casters are extra - but worth itLocks would be nice to keep the kiddies out - but I suppose I could fashion something if it was a big deal.Anyway - overall I am extremely pleased."
4,Not his best by far,"I feel this is Ron's second weakest effort, behind his debut. Don't get me wrong, I love this album and know every song by heart, but I don't really find myself listening to it as much as say ""Retriever"" or ""Whereabouts"". I'd suggest either of those 2 first then move on."
5,Such a great album,"This album is amazing!!!!!!! Thanx Ron for being there. It's definitely the Best album of 2001. Let's see Ron on stage, it's incredible. It's full of emotions. It's authentic."
3,Not Worth the Money,"My 9 year old son is a huge Star Wars fan. We have just about every book, poster, action figure and video game known to man. He was very excited about being Darth this year (he's already been the clone trooper, a jedi and a storm trooper). When we got the device, it was very difficult to find a way to get it to stay on the mask. It also was not very realistic sounding. It kind of sounded like static instead of Darth's signature breathing. He opted to leave the breathing device at home and enjoyed the light up saber much more."
2,Easy to read but too much opinion and not enough facts/objectiveness for me.,I don't remember what I was expecting from this book when I purchased it but I guess I was looking for a compelling argument as to why people should go raw. His writing style is fun and easy to read...he keeps it lighthearted and to the point but alot of the info presented was just opinion and not based on scientific evidence which I find disappointing. I know that the raw food diet is not mainstream therefore scientific evidence is probably scarce because of the lack of popularity but I still expected more...so I felt like I didn't really learn anything from this book...he does mention many different authors that deal with diet and what books were worth reading which I guess opens the door to other opinions and allows you to explore the raw food world better but other than that this book was kind of pointless for me.
4,Very Impressed...,Nice product! I received it very fast and I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.
3,Mostly good but straps need care,"Visibility seems good and the band of reflective strips across the vest seem very likely to enhance safety. There is a pocket that I don't think I'd ever use, but at least it's there.The weakness for me is that the stitching of the waistband seems quite weak. I am of above average height and build, but not overweight, and found that it was quite tight around me if I wore it over a couple of winter layers. Within the first handful of uses, the stress of pulling on the velcro straps to secure it led to one of them breaking off. There was a very flimsy machine stitch holding it on.On the positive side, you could sew the strap back on much stronger than it started if you wanted to. That's what I'm doing."
1,Buy this and be as sorry as this book,"This is horrible software. I am in the second chapter and I am just fusterated with the book. The material doesn't even perpare you for their own questions, how can it attempt to prepare you for Sun's. You think your doing alright untill you take the test at the end of the chapter and the questions cover things that are nowhere to be found in the material you just read. Then it has the nerve to go back and reread that material like its going to help. Don't wast your time with this second rate [junk]."
5,Great bag,"I am very pleased with this bag. I intend to use it for a toy travel bag for my daughter, but it has numerous uses. It would make a great pool bag since it is waterproof and has shoulder-length handles. It has a bit of a plastic smell, but that should dissipate with use and airing."
2,Not Much to Offer for This Generation of Game,"Dark Summit really has little to offer since it is a cross between a platformer and a sports game it typiclaly lacks at both. Befor purchasing this game know that SSX tricky has better graphics, sound and gameplay as well as THPS 3 for that matter and genre. This game really seems like somthing that could have been released on the PS One a couple years ago and been great but for todays generation of games it really lacks a physics system feel and overall level of fun. Not Recommended, possible rental."
5,came very quickly and was as discribed,Andre Rieu in ConcertEnjoy this CD very much. It was a gift to my husband and he listens to it a lot. No problems with disc itself.
5,This is the one scholars quote from . . .,"A collection of the major Mesopotamian myths translated by a respected scholar. This is an excellent source for those desiring an authoritative translation. Even so, these myths can be somewhat awkward to read given Dalley's use of square brackets to indicate gaps in the text and omission dots to indicate an unknown word or phrase. No doubt these are accepted academic techniques for translating ancient texts, but I do hope someone will come along and render these myths in a more enthralling format. For just such an example of how ancient texts can be made to come alive for the modern reader, see ""Gilgamesh: A New English Version"" by Stephen Mitchell . Nonetheless, I give Dalley five stars, but also highly, highly recommend Mitchell's new version of Gilgamesh."
2,Blah! (Warning: This item will bore you to tears.),"I'm a HUGE fan of mythology and I wanted to pass this love onto my son so I purchased this book. This is not a storybook or a story-stylized telling of the myths, its academia. If you're looking for a good read of the stories of Gilgamesh and Babylonian/Assyrian myths pass this book up. Ms. Dally was probably a fine academian and you'll get plenty of notes, and notes on from whence the information came, but as a story it is a wash. There should be some way of notating that."
2,Disappointed,"The book was advertised as ""like new"". Upon receipt, I found that it had been written through on every page of the first 2 chapters. On top of that, the answers were wrong."
4,Great for a romantic night in,"I purchased this fondue pot for my boyfriend's birthday and it was great! It was just perfect for the two of us, but it would probably be too small for having company over.The one thing I would suggest is to find a good chocolate fondue recipe other than the one provided in the instruction manual, it uses vegetable oil and melted chocolate chips and I know there are much better recipes out there.Shipped fast...overall a good buy."
4,Can't wait to try them,"I purchased these as companion rulers for patterns in the book Jelly Roll Quilt Magic. Although I have not used them yet, they look as though they will work beautifully with pre-cuts and not be wasteful of fabric."
3,Difficult to comprehend,"I felt this woman has some great information, but found myself lost in her concepts based apparently on all her experience...in other words, I found her hard to relate to though seemed like her information is valuable."
1,"Spirituality discussion, yes. Help with self esteem, no.","This book was filled with discussion of spirituality and God, but had very little to do with how to stop thinking negative thoughts. I found it hard to follow, and what little non-rambling there was seemed to be punctuated every 10 words with ""God!"""
5,right on the money,This book is right on the money! It nails the reality we all face with always wondering what other people are thinking and modifying our behavior to fit their expectations. Cole-Whittaker points out the what we do and why we do it with razor sharp clarity. She does this and at the same time points the way to modifying our own behavior and subconscious influences. I haven't even finished it yet but have quoted a number of parts to friends and they have agreed that she is right on. She combines all of this with a clear understanding of the importance of our relationship with God and His role in all of this. Wonderful!
4,The best early sim game there is!,"I used to play this game for hours on end when Super Nintendo was the thing to have. There are so many ways to play this game. You start at hte dawn of civilization and have to build up your civilization to withstand attacks from warring tribes of other cultures, all the while increasing your knowledge of science and inventing to advance. Careful balance between learning and culture and military training os important. Play until you have sufficient technology to construct an space vehicle and launch to the stars.Or you can carefully hunt down and destroy your enemies and conquer the world! Anyway you want to play it it is fun and challenging. Even though the graphics can't stand up to the recent icarnations on the PC, the original Sid Maier's Civilization the wil withstand the test of time!"
4,A movie with charming actors,"""Win A Date With Tad Hamilton"" is one of those movies that one should see to enjoy charming and warm performances rather than a interesting storyline or revelations of deep emotional truths. It's abundantly clear that this film is a rehash of countless other romantic comedies with all the same twist and turns. The performances by the Josh Duhamel, Topher Grace, and Kate Bosworth, however, make the films predictability enjoyable.Both Duhamel and Grace have an easy charm and warmth that make their characters appealing for audience memebers. The real standout here, however, has to be with a doubt Kate Bosworth. In my opinion she is perhaps one of the best looking actresses on film, period. With her wholesome all-American looks audiences can't help but melt from her beaming smile and flawless complexion. Bosworth has a screen presence and charisma that lifts what is a essentially a mediocre story to a warm treat."
4,Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!,"When Rosalee wins a date with her favorite actor, Tad Hamilton, her secret admirer and long-time friend Pete is not too thrilled. When Tad pursues her back to West Virginia, Pete is even less thrilled. Tad quickly realizes that he is not the only one who is after Rosalee's affections, and thus a battle of sorts for her affections ensues. Both funny and sweet at times, this movie was very entertaining, even though it was fairly predictable."
5,"Original, Creative, Enjoyable for Children and Adults","My 6 year old daughter borrowed this book from the library at school. She brings home books every week from the library and always enjoys them, but this book was different. I read it to both my 5 and 6 year old and although it was longer than most books I read to them, it held their attention, they were making predictions, and they begged me to buy it for them. It is the one book my daughter has borrowed that she has not forgotten about. A very clever story."
4,"Simple, and works well","I previously used Palm's own case for my 650, which surprisingly didn't fit the Treo well (it fit quite loosely inside). This clip works great for me, it only adds the minimum of bulk to the already large Treo. I've used this clip for several months in a manufacturing environment, and it only dropped the phone once (and I immediately felt the clip get caught and open when it did). I also like the fact that the keyboard and screen face inward to protect them. I have only two minor criticisms. First, I found the belt clip was uncomfortable until I started wearing it upside down (the end of the clip is hooked, so it's never slipped off my belt this way). The second criticism is that the spring loaded clip that secures the phone occasionally contacts the sd card and partially ejects it. Neither issue is enough to really bother me, I'm very happy with this holster."
2,Maybe rent if you can before you buy....,"I'm a die-hard Dukes fan that even collects some Dukes related memorabilia. I have been to ""Cooter's Place"" in Sperryville, VA (Not there anymore, I heard), and have met Ben J. briefly - nice guy! I have the greatest respect for John S. and wish him lots of good fortune from the airing of the original series, as well as for his efforts in making this movie, - however it is one I would not watch more than once. If you've seen all the Dukes of Hazard series and are looking for something more, I would encourage you to check out ""Moonrunners"". It was the original movie that the Dukes of Hazard series was later loosely based on. I know some will say I shouldn't be comparing ""Collier & Co. Hot Pursuit"" to the Dukes series, but in my humble opinion, this isn't even a good ""car movie""."
3,not bad not good,the movie isnt to bad but you have to be a die hard fan of th dukes of hazzard or camcorder view fan;its a bit to low buget for my taste .sorry john s
3,the cover ratings were over done,"It was amusing in some parts w/ clever word play, but it deteriorated toward the end. Archaic language made it somewhat difficult to read."
1,problem,"I would love to write a review if the items had ever arrived which they haven't.I found the book in Paris. Captured by its famous opening sentence, I bought it. Then I became amazed at its tone-- whimsical humor and tragedy juxtaposed as they are in life. The gender identities of the narrator and his/her beloved were unclear with the narrator ruminating and examining religious beliefs as s/he traveled over the Middle East. Now if the books would only arrive, i could give another one to a friend and have one for myself.M. Acevedo"
2,Did not fit on vehicle it said it would fit on.,"In general, I'm sure the product is fine. Shipping was fast, the price is right. One minor detail, I had input my vehicle information and was told that this part would fit on my car. It was wrong. Not a huge deal, but when your car is not running and you are counting on a part, it's really annoying. Refund was handled quickly, just note that this part does not fit on a 2008 Scion xB as advertised."
1,Is this an oven or a water pitcher?,"The switchover from microwave to toaster oven and back is not toooo time consuming, but it is a bit bothersome.The condensation from microwaving is a huge pain. Water literally runs down the interior walls and door, and drips out when opened. If the door is not left open for hours to air-dry the interior, the water will still be there the next day.An email to Rival got this response:""I have just received your email and I would like to thank you for writing. I am sorry to hear of your disappointment with our product. The condensation build up on the door is normal. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.""Conveniently blew me off and ignored my description of water running down the sides and out the door.A local retail giant has been selling these things as low as $38 to get rid of them."
3,Not much to it.,"A couple of the graphics stood out, most weren't very interesting. A lot of vintage ads with no real artistic value."
5,"True words, sound advice","A MUST read one of the many amazing works of Mr. Hartmann a true progressive. We find ourselves in a crossroad of which the path is clear but the obticles are very powerful and many. This book deals with a true path to enlightenment in doing the right thing, not the most profitable. One can only hope that these words are spread far and wide and are headed. Beware people a storm is coming and many will not survive."
4,Not rot-your-brains-out fare,"The graphics are okay, and the plot is a little overdramatic. However, the gameplay is incredible. Strategy is very, very, necessary. The chapters can become super-challenging, so be sure to brush up on your chess play before starting, say, chapter 19. Oh... And while this is great, Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword is better."
4,Double the quality of store bike at this price.,"I went to Walmart and found their bikes at about $130. This bike was $150 and is much nicer than those. Hands down, this is a better buck/bargain.I bought two bikes and neither came in a box with any padding. If there is damage, UPS WILL deny a claim because they require 2"" of padding. I don't know how easily Amazon accepts returns if there is damage.Everything works good on this bike. The shocks are pretty loose and work well for city and dirt road riding. The thing looks fantastic. It really looks a cut above bikes at this price range."
2,Not really...,"Lots of recipes, but what bartending guide does not have a listing/recipe for a LONG ISLAND ICED TEA!??? This is a revised edition, but how long ago was it ""revised""?????????"
1,A Horrible thing that is awful,"This is the worst phone I've ever bought. And I bought a mickey mouse phone. From the first call we made on it, people complained about not being able to hear us, but we went along with it and just talked louder. Then it started only ringing for about half of our calls, and we really got angry. We continued to use it though, and within two weeks of the purchase it completely stopped ringing or having the ability to dial. Best of all, we called GE for some customer service, and they basically said that because we bought it online we were SOL. do not buy this phone,if someone gave you 5 dollars to take it you'd be getting ripped off."
4,Great way to find your way around in NY,"This atlas is very good, nicely detailed, well laid out and very crisply printed. This size is perfect for your glove box or carry it with you. If you wanted to plot out alternate routes or just to see the ""big"" picture then the larger size would be suggested. Note that this smaller version was labeled on Amazon as laminated but it was not. A bit of a let down but the price made it a steal."
5,Excellent bike for around $100,"I had no problem assembling this bike, since I had the right tools. Most of it is assembled already. I had to install the handle bar, bolt on the front tire, bolt on the pedals, assemble the seat, and install the fenders. I also bought a woman's cruiser bike from the same company, and I noticed the fenders on this one are easier to install. In fact, I didn't need any tools to screw on the fenders. We put a child bike-seat on the back for our daughter and she loves it. I'd recommend checking all nuts and bolts periodically, especially after the first few rides. The seat is comfortable and handle bars are great for my long arms. I gave it 5 stars because I was able to get is under $100."
2,TOO GORY FOR ME,"Frankly I found this story just too gory for my likes. I like ghost stories and such but vampires and blood graphically described just turns me off.The writing itself is excellent, just did not like the prose."
2,Not a very impressive book...,"This was my first Shannon Drake book, and I have to say I was very disappointed. The characters were not very well developed, the plot was kind of weak and predictable, and if there was any romance in the entire book, I must have dozed through it. I don't consider to virtaul strangers hitting the sheets a few times a ""romance"". All in all, I would not recommend this book. My biggest regret is that I bought this book and the next one in the series together before reading any of them. I feel like I've wasted my money.If you like vampire romances I highly recommend Linda Lael Miller's series, and Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series. These are much, much better books that handle the genre with ease, and great storytelling ability from the authors."
2,No Depth,"This book was a tremendous disappointment. The characters had no depth, and the romance was nonexistant. I had to force myself to finish this novel. The writing was hurried, and the dialogue was sometimes hard to follow. This book has few highlights. I bought this book along with another in her vampire series; I'm very reluctant to read it. Linda Lael Miller has a much better vampire series."
1,Messy blender,"I bought this blender because of the Krups name and the claim to crush ice and make frozen drinks. I liked the glass container also, but am very dissappointed in the fact that it leaks a lot and makes a big mess, spraying liquid out the back base. I tried changing the ring, using it wet, dry, but nothing helped. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it."
1,Piece of junk,"This has got to be the worst blender ever made. Really! 6 months old. Incredibly noisy, vibrates like crazy, and now leaks so badly thatit must be run in the sink. This blender was a new warranty replacement unit. I recieved it 6 months ago in exchange for one that had the exact same problems.Now, that it has been over a year since my original purchase, all Krups can tell me is to send it to a repair shop and pay whatever. Its not worth repairing. I suppose I can accept the business of the year limit. That said, however, I must exclaim: what stupid engineering!Krups deserves to fail in the blender business if this is all the interest they have in design and quality. I bought this one because of the Krups name... never again. I am ordering an Oster today."
3,Not what I expected,"It took a long time to get moving, and even then there seemed to be some resistance to making things happen. I really liked the world he built and the characters, but it could have been done with tighter prose and more intense imagery. Not his best work. I will still look forward to the next volume."
2,"All Filler, No Meat","I read a lot of fantasy and many series are comprised of a lot of filler over the duration, The Wizard Lord manages to out-filler even the worst offenders in just a single book! 90% of the book is spent on the most mundane and unimportant things ever as well as walking around from place to place with almost nothing of value happening or coming from it. I actually laughed out loud at the grand finale that the whole book leads up to, which to say was anti-climactic would be grossly overselling it even. Characters constantly restate the obvious, and what little plot there is, when so little happens that you could not possibly forget and the ""twist"" could only be surprising to someone that has never read even a children's book before. The reason it is all so disappointing is that at its core there is a great kernel of an idea here and easily could have been not just OK, but exceptional. This work falls very short of the mark in almost every possible way."
4,"It's Beautiful, BUT......","This watch is very nice. It goes will with a dress or a pair of jean. However, this watch is VERY TINY, the diameter of this watch is LESS than 20mm (including the stainless ring) and it's exactly 15mm for the diameter of the dial, so if you have a middle to large wrist (you probably want to go for a different watch, because big wrist (sadly, which i am) and this watch just don't go together!) I wish Amazon had indicated that little detail on the watch information before i brought this watch. Anyway, another thing is that the pink color on the dial, it's NOT light pink like i was expecting/hoping. It's more like a milky light peach pink, I can't even describe the color, i think it's kinda of a strange pink. (maybe it's just the watch I receive or something, i am not sure about that).Overall, i still think this is a nice watch, which i think it truly deserves a 4 stars at the current price they are selling."
5,so simple,I thought this was just another timer but am amazed at the number of times I've already used it. It's so simple to start and stop.
3,"Yes, it works","The timer cube works, but one of the LEDs is not working. Pretty cheaply put together--but it has its beneficial uses."
2,Buy a Burley instead,"We live on an island where cars are not allowed, so biking is our primary mode of transportation. We use a trailer EVERY DAY in EVERY kind of weather - sun, rain, ice, snow - you name it. We received this trailer as a baby shower gift in June 2004. By the middle of this past summer, 2005, most of the straps had disintegrated. We are now forced to use bungies to keep our son strapped in, and we have two more years at least before he will ""graduate"" to his own bike. We also own a Burley D'Lite, which we used for our two other children when they were young. The Burley endured at least 3 years of the same abuse before we decided to get a new trailer for the baby. All the straps on the Burley are still intact, and the inside was still useable for transport. The only problem was the outer covering was getting beat up from being out in the weather all the time. Please save your money and go with the Burley. It costs more, but it is at least 3 times more durable."
4,Excellent GET RICH GUIDE,"Mark F. LaMoure, Boise, IDWEALTH GUIDEDo you want wealth guidance? 'Millionaire Republican' by Wayne Allen Root is a top-rated book. It guides you with specific ways to get rich. Mr. Root delivers a golden blueprint with 18 secrets many Republican millionaires and billionaires follow to earn wealth.FIRST CLASS BOOKDO NOT be put off by the book's 'Republican' title, because the book is for everybody who wants an improved financial status in life. I rate the book 4 Gold Stars, because it delivers insiders secrets you can follow for raising your economic status almost immediately.GOLDEN BOOKIn my humble opinion the book is a prize winning guide for building a foundation of wealth. Its exceptional. Mr. Root's book is easy to read, well-written and jam-packed with high caliber secrets. Its pure gold. Check it out if you want excellent answers for getting rich. You'll be glad you did."
1,Root has no understanding of the American people,"What I got out of this book was, that Mr. Root feels that Democrats are either Welfare Queens or somehow dependent on the Government, or else are lazy and content to remain Blue Collar workers, including police, fire, teachers, etc. He attempts to connect Republicans with Wealth. I do not know what part of George Soros, Warren Beaty, the wealthy Hollywood crowd, other wealthy Democrats that Mr. Root has missed. And his scorn for American Teachers is evident in this book.I find Mr. Root's book, in this era of Republican Corruption, crimes and abuse of power, to be somewhat amusing."
5,Pssst! Hammerman's After You!,"Saw the 18th Emergency when i was a young kid,my favorite story.The other 3 stories aren't too bad.Will never forget that title this was a great story about a kid being bullied.They fight and no weapons of any kind were used,the way it used to be.Marv Hammerman And his bud,Peaches you must watch out for them.However,we do find out that Marv is a very sensitive and insecure fellow and hurts easily,feelings-wise that is.I would recommend this."
1,Rust Appeared < Two Months,"The teakettle rusted at the weld on the pour spout and inside the kettle in less than two months. Krups will charge you for the replacement shipping costs. This is not oulined in the warranty and appears to be a unilateral policy designed to squeeze the last nickel from the consumer. I concur with Lynn's review, below, for the ""Customer Service Reality""."
3,"poppy, poppy, fun music","I like this cd. They're no Led Zeppelin or other significant type of group...but they do know how to write and play fun songs. 25 years ago, they would have been competition for the Go-Go-s or Bangles. Today there is no market for this.The singer has a sassy, bubbly attitude that comes out through the vocals. This is not current fluff b/c the lyrics pay hommage to bands from yesteryear. She looks pretty cute on the line notes as well!The best song is track 1. There is not a bad song on the cd. Not a great work, put good. Compared to today's market where there is a hit single and then a bunch of filler... this is heads and tales above the rest"
4,Does Longer Equal Better?,"The only way for the latest cast recording of 42nd Street to compete with the Original Cast Album is size. CD technology has allowed for the inclusion of the show's extensive dance breaks, and the inclusion is a welcome one...thrilling would be the word. On top of this, Christine Ebersole tops the original's Tammy Grimes, shining most in a newly added number (obviously) not on the original. The only times when this recording severely pales to that of the 1980 cast is in Lullabye of Broadway and the vocal finale, where the power of Jerry Orbach's voice is sorely missed."
4,Cheap and good value for money!,Amazon has great deals on this product - we use it in our DVD camcorder and it works great.
5,"Good, durable square for the money","I bought this after consider other options such as the Incra and Woodpecker equivalent. I really like the fact that this one is a steel square vs. the aluminum ones. So...I took the risk and bought this one. Just received the package yesterday. The square is straight, flat, and definitely square. Would be a good tool for machine set up."
2,Top gets too hot! No insulating layer in the lid.,"Our old cordless has to be propped up with a plastic fork and a cup set on the top to get it to work, so we went to buy a new one. While the size and speed of heating are fine, the top gets hot enough to burn your fingers. Other varieties have at least two layers of plastic and possibly insulation in between, and that's all this one needs to be an excellent appliance."
5,older child adoption,"I bought this book in desperation right after we adopted two foreign born boys, ages 7 and 9. The nine year old was totally whacked, behavior wise, and we surmised he had been abused at a young age. He would totally freak if you even tried to correct him, or if he didn't like dinner, whatever. He would sit and holler, scream, kick, bite, break his bedroom furniture, etc. for hours until he wore himself out. This book did go aways to saving our sanity, as did the fact that it improved when his English got better."
5,Awsome,this tanker is very highly detailed arrived in perfect condition smells like a new toy (model) it is being used alot
2,Lots of leaks,This mask did not work well for me. The mask did not seal well around my face I had to really tighten the mask to get a nominal seal. The purge valve also leaked quite a bit of water.
5,Very useful,"I bought this for my aunt and she loved it!she uses this pan for cooking cakes, she said it's lovely and easy to clean."
5,"No Lag, great controllers","At first I thought they would feel different while using them, compared to the ps2 standard controllers. The difference was't noticable, you feel at hand like if you have your old ps2 controllers during gameplay.I like its battery life, great range,NO LAG.Nice controllers I would suggest buying."
3,Logitech Wireless PS2 Controller,"Our 14 y.o. daughter LOVES this wireless controller! It works great with all her PS2 games except the 2008 version of Soccer. For some reason this controller goes all funky when she plays her new soccer game, so she has to switch over to the corded controller. I sure hope the wireless will be compatible with all the other 2008 games. If not the $28 we spent will have been a waste."
4,Not to bad,I found this to be a helpful source in writing my term paper. It is great for any college student wanting to learn more about music or any music major
3,A Decent Book on Strength,"Written by an ex-Poliquin disciple.This nice book contains some interesting facts on Strength Training but there is nothing more than what you can find reading the t-nation articles.Just a collection of old and new methods on the development of strength and muscle. Nothing shocking here.If you are a begginer, i think you can benefit from this book.A decent book with a bad layout by the way."
4,curious,"Obviously, it's not the most practical or useful item out there. Still, it managed to get laughs and uses. It's different and brings a breath of fresh air to gag gifting."
4,Tissue anyone?,I bought this tissue holder for my niece's apartment. It is quite real looking and comes with one tissue sticking through it's nose so you don't have any reason to wonder how to load it. It makes for an interesting conversation piece and is quite functional as well.
4,Loved But Unused,"I adore this tissue box but am unable to use it because the tissues I buy don't fit -- this cover is built to completely hide only the shortest of tissue boxes (I buy Kleenex and Puffs brands, and both are too tall).Still, I keep it on display (who wouldn't?) and plan to find a solution one day. Perhaps I'll get the right sized tissue box and just remove and refill it with my favorite brand when needed. I like it so much, it would be worth the effort.(Someone else also mentioned that it tips forward if you stand it up -- it IS heavy in the face with a light black base and a simple elastic band to keep the tissue box attached. I've never been able to stand it up on its own -- it always tips forward -- but keeping it down doesn't take away from the effect.)"
5,Cool japanese punk ska band! great!!,"Coquettish is nice punk ska band!!(yeah!) they like the suicide machines & Operation IVY!! this band is japanese not popular band! play underground....uummm [So,I say goodbye] is great punk song! Hey! Let's listening [You chase me]!!! Let's gooooo!!!!"
4,They still have a lot of room for improvement...,"It obviously deserves 5 stars for effort. Getting a signed on a major record label, coping to the american standards of music, and surviving. I say they will meet Choking Victim, Operation Ivy, and Streetlight as the best in ska.Just listen ""You Should Be Free, This Is Your Life"", and dare to tell me that Japan doesn't produce."
2,Is this ENGLISH?,"This band, Coquettish, is clearly a band made up of Japanese members. It's not very good, but it's a bit entertaining. No bad language, adaquate instruments, bad vocals."
3,Poor Adhesive,"This item is good value for the money, easy to install, and works well. However, the adhesive gave up after a few months. The garage floor (concrete) was cleaned and degreased with brake cleaner before application, but I guess the CR-V was too much for it."
5,"Simple solution, easy to use","When I bought a newer car I needed to swap garage sides with my wife. I had been using a laser system that worked fine for me but she wasn't as ""rigorous"" and tended to crowd my workshop. So I got these plastic ""bumps"" that you glue to the floor and they work great. Now we both are able to get the car just inside the door and leave the most room in front of the car. It's much simpler and easier to use than the lasers. Although I did think the lasers were pretty cool! ;-)"
5,Works great. Tape sticks well to epoxy coated floor.,I needed some parking bumps to tell me when I pulled in to the garage with enough clearance at the front. The double sided tape stuck to the concrete and all is good. No tennis ball hanging from the ceiling.
3,Basically useless for larger vehicles,"I have a midsize SUV and you really can't feel the vehicle roll onto the strip. That being said, its probably fine for sedans."
5,Work as advertised!,"We use the whole front of our garage for storage, so it's a tight squeeze. These things work great! Just swept the concrete clean, peeled off the tape on the bottom of the AccuPark, and set it in place. It's been several months and they still work great! Only one is needed per vehicle, and I bought two - one for each car."
5,WAT HOW COULD U SAY THIS SUCKS,"This Game Is GREAT i have it for PSP and Ps2 i rather play the PSP version any day!!!!! i thought it wouldnt be that good but they surprised me by how they made people use the triangle,square,X,and,O to AIm at the enemy and i love how u get to play as tachikoma in any stage that nobidy went in him i love game............its worth its money this is the game u beat and want more i think the multiplayer great me and myu friend have mad fun"
3,butler tray hinge,this is a good match to what i had but it is about 3/32 of an inch to wide to match the old hinge i wanted to replace. i don't know if i want to router out all eight of the hinges to acomidate the new hinges. this is an antique i am trying to repair.
2,Great features but poor quality,"The first unit I bought was defective, with very noisy calls after two days of use. Unplugging and resetting the unit took the problem away temporarily, but after two more days of use, noisy calls again. And so on.Returning the defective new unit to Panasonic meant I was without a phone for some time. Panasonic did not repair my phone but instead sent a replacement. After using the replacement unit for some months, now two columns of keys on the base unit are inoperative. No relief, even temporary, from resetting. Now I get to send the second, replacment unit back to Panasonic and wait again for another replacement.Unless you have lots more patience than I do, maybe you should look for a higher quality product."
3,dj case,it's very heavy and we had to finally attach wheels to it since that makes it easier to haul around
3,nice glasses Bluetooth wasnt great for me,Good looking glasses but the bluetooth quality wasn't excellent for me. I live in a high tree area so this might have come into the picture.
3,latex swimcap,"I swim six days a week, so I need cap that will hold up well. This latex cap worked great for a week, then started sticking to itself and needing to be coaxed apart under water in order to put it on. It probably works much better if you dry it and powder it after each use. It is reasonably priced and durable."
5,Cambridge's King's Singers!,"Beautifully recorded and some of the most talented singing I've had the pleasure to listen to and enjoy. You'll find some traditional carols you may not be familiar with, but that will become your favorites!"
3,"Good, but not great","I'm usually a Powerbar person, but one day I bought these instead. They are a little chalky, so make sure you drink them with water. But they are quite chocolatey inside, and the outer coating is very sweet and yummy. These are listed as an ""energy bar,"" though I felt no boost. Interestingly, my husband, who will NOT eat Powerbars, loves these things. Overall, they are a good and healthy snack. I recommend them if you don't mind a slightly chalky bar."
2,Corrections please!,"I have found numerous incorrect statements, explanations and answers for the practice tests. This product was released in May 2001 and as of yet Sybex has no errata or corrections available for download on their website.Since this is a test prep CD it's imperative the information it provides be 100% correct! Errors can be expected when something of this nature is first released but their failure to provide corrections is inexcusable!"
3,What I learned was You (Mike) need to do more research!,"Found an error in Chapter 26, page 280, re: the last surviving Civil War veterans. The last Union veteran (Albert Woolson) died on August 2, 1956 (not the stated 1951)at age 109. The last Confederate veteran, Walter W. Williams (not the stated ""Walter Washington"")died on December 19, 1959 (not the stated 1952) at age 117. The reference for the above is the New York Times newspaper, August 2, 1956."
