2,Didn't help me,"I bought this cup as I have difficulty swallowing large vitamin tablets, although I have no problem with smaller tablets.After reading the reviews of the Oralflo cup, especially the reviews from parents of children who needed to swallow tablets, I ordered one full of enthusiasm. However when I tried it, it made no difference whatsoever to my ability to swallow a tablet without gagging. A good idea, but doesn't work for me."
3,Use of God's name and John 1:1,"J. Moffatt on page XX paragraph 4 offers an explanation why he choose to replace God's personal name Yahweh or Jehovah with ""the Eternal"". As a reminder that name appears more then any other name in Bible about 7,000 times.At John 1:1 he follows the Greek by translating ""the Logos was divine."""
3,"Great TV, HD is beautiful, but...","This tv is great. Looks sharp and is very clear and bright. Only downside, remotes. There are no universal remote codes that work with it. Soyo says that Pioneer or Sharp codes should work. They don't. Many places online say that Proton codes should work. They don't. If you have a remote with a scan function, it'll find nothing. Learning remotes are iffy, some work, most don't. The only remote I have that sorta works is my Harmony 880 and even it doesn't work all the time. If you can deal with the remote problem, it's recommend this tv. If not, move along."
3,Pretty Good for a Cordless Trimmer,I received this Trimmer/Edger as a gift from my mother. She did not know I have a gas trimmer and edger. I have owned corded electric trimmers and replaced them for a gas version. I liked the light weight of the Worx. I was not sure how it would hold up to the crab grass and other weeds in my yard. It did pretty good for a cordless. I like the line guard. Spool came off one time when I bumped a concrete flower bed border. It was easy to replace. I may look into buying better line and loading it on the spool myself. I have not tried the edger but I am looking forward to seeing how it will work. I don't have much use for a line based edger but it may be fine for small areas. This Worx trimmer/edger may be good for quick jobs around my 2 acre yard.
3,Know it's limitations,"I was persuaded by the video presentation for this product and decided to take a chance that it did do what they claimed. In all fairness, it does trim grass....short grass. Tall grass bogs the motor down and it doesn't do a very good job. The cutting string is very thin and doesn't seem to have the strength to cut thick grass or weeds. Maybe it is because I got the 18 volt one and not the 24 volt model, but still......The battery does last longer than most due to the lithium technology. There is a confusing learning curve involved in charging it for the first time, and you can't leave it on the machine between uses, it drains the battery. It is light, and handy. Is it worth the $...I guess. I was just expecting GREAT and got OK..."
1,Don't buy this,"I was sucked in by the commercial - so dumb! This worked for the first time and that's it! It doesn't hold any charge, it has no power even when it just starts, it has the ability to have the handle go down but is so awkward that you're breaking your back to use it that way. Summed up ... It is a complete waste of money. I called customer service and was basically told - too bad, so sad."
3,WORX GT WG150.1,WORKS GREAT FOR ITS INTENDED USE. WHEN I ORDERED IT I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THE ONE THAT WASADVERTISED ON TV VIA AN INFOMERCIAL WHICH PROMOTED A LITHIUM BATTERY. THE ONE I ORDEREDCAME WITH A NI-CAD BATTERY. BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE UNIT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.
3,"Easy to use, light weight trimmer - a success from Amazon.com","I use this trimmer everyday. I followed the battery break in period instructions, but am a little disappointed that I don't get longer use out of each charge, I am getting about 20 - 30 minutes depending on how tough the area I am trimming is. I really like this machine. It is light weight, so, I would like it to run for an hour at least. It is also very simple to use. Changing the spools is easy and a great improvement over having to restring my old gas-run JD trimmer. Do be careful when ordering the spool refills on Amazon, the recommended purchase was not for the correct model and so I had to return mine and order again. There are apparently many different model. It was worth the cost and I'm sure I will get my money's worth out of it."
1,ONLY 10 minutes worth of work!!,"The product works great for only 10 minutes at a time, so with 2 fully charged batteries you should get about 20 minutes worth of work."
3,worx cordless trimmer/edger,"love the product, saves time, no cord mess, batery recharge not needed often, light weight, durable. just wish it had more power."
1,AND THE 1 STAR IS FOR THE COMMERCIAL !!!,STAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE TRIMMERS UNTIL THEY SOLVE THERE BATTERY PROBLEMS.. BOUGHT LAST SUMMER WITH 2 BATTERIES..STORED OVER THE WINTER AS RECOMMENDED..JUST TRIED TO USE FOR FIRST TIME AND 1 BATTERY IS DEFECTIVE AND WONT CHARGE..THE OTHER CHARGES AND LASTS ABOUT A MINUTE.. OF COURSE REPLACEMENT BATTERIES ARE HALF OF WHAT I PAID FOR THE TRIMMER.. RIP OFF !!!!GOING BACK TO THE CORDS !!
1,Not a good choice,I would not recommend this grass trimmer unless you have say a 10ft by 10ft yard. Its a waste of time and electricity. Had to recharge several times a day just to get a portion of my yard done. By the time I am finish the first part would have grown back.
3,Good for weedeating but don't buy this product for the edger,"I was impressed with this product for weedeating. It's lightweight which is great for us women who have to do our own yard work )-: but the edger was not very effective. Also, I had problems with the line advancing. Had to keep stopping and advancing it manually."
1,Dead as a door nail...,I am on my second battery. Charged it for 48 hours and just went out to try it again. Barely did 2 fence posts of light trimming before it died. Wait a few moments and you might get a 5 or 10 second burst but it is short lived. Purchased in June and have only been able to use it a few times. The customer service is abysmal. I have requested an RMA to send it back but am not expecting any kind of response. Caveat Emptor.
2,Dissatisfied,"Although this trimmer does a good job, the battery is terrible. My yard only takes 20 minutes to trim but the battery does not even last that long. Then when I plug it in to charge, the green light on the charger comes on telling me that it is charged when it is dead. The next day I can plug it in and it will begin to charge. So, it takes me two days to trim my yard. Two days in the heat. I am very, very disappointed with this trimmer. I wish I had my old cheap trimmer back."
2,Worx GT WG150.1,"Battery life is good, charging fairly quick. Works great as a weed eater but over-rated as an edger."
3,Don't let the infomercials excite you about this trimmer,"Not all its cracked up to be. Its just a cordless trimmer, and not a GREAT one at that. Battery life is much shorter than the rated 1 hour, I get about 15 minutes out of mine. The highly touted multiple configurations are not all that useful. If you can afford a cordless trimmer from one of the major manufacturers, find one with good reviews and but it instead. I would not buy this one again, nor recommend it."
3,Great for the elderly,"I bought this for my mother who is over 50 years old. It is not overly powerful but for moderate grooming jobs it's fine. The gripes I have is that the line breaks allot, as well as the battery life isn't great. But like I said it should only be used for light to moderate jobs but not as a serious garden tool"
2,Disappointed,"On tv the worx GT trimmer looked as if it could handle the job of trimming a lawn with no hesitation what so ever, I was most disappointed in the trimmer. The same area had to be passed over several times to get the grass cut, And the grass was not even 3"" high. If I did not live out side of the USA I would have quickly packed it up and sent it back.On the other hand it is light weight."
2,Not enough Power.,"I bought it at sears for $99 after seeing the infomercial and needing it now. It is light and very adjustable, but the thing got bound up on fairly light grass. I also couldnt get it to cut the grass around the swing set pole. I tried every angle. My old wired black and decker did it fine. Then the battery life was questionable. I have a tiny front yard and 1500Sq ft back yard and I was percieving the battery to have less power half way through edging my back yard. So I took it back to sears. I bought the black and decker 12 inch cordless for the exact same price and it came with two batteries and has plenty of power just like it was wired."
1,Not worth it,"Six uses and mine is broken already. The hub that holds the line spool (at the lowest extremity of the trimmer) wore down within the last six uses and has just fallen to pieces. I have to trim around a lot of flagstone, and the hub touches down frequently. The GT is not made to handle that and now it's busted. I have to go to the site and see what the warranty covers. My previous corded electric lasted 10 years with no such problem.Before that, my main complaint is that it's too wimpy to cut thick or tough grass/weeds, and the battery runs down before I finish my front and back yard.Nice to trim without the cord, but that convenience is not worth the lack of quality in the tool."
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS,"I WROTE 3 WEEKS AGO ON THE UNIT ITSELF. IF YOU HAVE ONLY 1 SQUARE FOOT OF GRASS TO TRIM ITS FINE. OTHERWISE IT IS USELESS. HOWEVER NOW THE PROBLEM IS TO GET CREDIT FOR THE RETURN. THEY HAVE JERKED MY CHAIN FOR 3 WEEKS SAYING ITS IN THE MAIL. IF THAT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH THEY NOW HAVE CHARGED MY C/CARD FOR THE NEXT PAYMENT. NOW THEY HAVE THE RETURNED TOOLS AS WELL AS MY MONEY. THANK GOD FOR AM/EX. I CALLED THEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO PULL THE MONEY BACK AND I WILL RECEIVE THE PROPER CREDIT.A LITTLE FOOTNOTE...IT COST ME OVER $25.00 TO SEND THIS JUNK BACK AND OF COURSE THATS MY NICKEL, NOT THEIRS..BEWARE..."
1,piece of junk,batteries are terrible. burned them out in one month. they sent new ones. burned those up the next season. thing lasted 13 months and it is worth less now. had 2 batteries also....
1,What a waste of money,"Purchased last summer and worked fine. Pulled out this spring and now the battery won't charge. Not just one but both of the ones I have. It could be the charger itself but I'm not going to waste my money finding out. Worx customer service was useless as well, so much for the fancy infomercial."
2,Not quite as advertised...,"While the unit is light, it is somewhat flimsy, especially the wheels. And all of the negative comments about the ""self-feeding"" spool have happened with my trimmer. It does NOT work as stated by Robin in the ad as the instructions I got state you have to turn the unit on and off a number of times to get it to self feed the line. However, I find it easier just to shut the darn thing off and press the feeder button two or three times to get the spool out so I can continue to trim. Ergonomically, this thing is great, but you can get tired using it, which is, again, contrary to the TV ads. Overall, not a bad unit but definitely not as good as show in the TV ads, which I find rather deceptive, misleading, and borders on the edge of false advertising. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,Worx GT 10-Inch 18-Volt Cordless Electric String Trimmer/Edger #WG150,"very easy to used save a lot of headach , powerful enough need no gas or electric wire. i love it ."
2,Free battery replacement,.Go to worxbattery.com.Enter info including the serial number of your battery andyou will likely qualify for a free battery replacement.
1,WORX,This product does not live up to its advertisement. This machine is short on power. You must manually release the cord most of the time this is tiresome and on my machine the cord was trap and I had to manually untangle the cord. I would not suggest its purchase.
2,Worx lacks the power I was expecting,"So I have had the Worx for several weeks now and I find that it just does not get the job done. I was looking for an alternative to the gas powered trimmers, but I did not want to go electric and have to drag a cord around. I will be buying an electric trimmer, because the Worx just does not have the power. It take me a lot longer to get my trimming done now and the power is just not there. I like that is it battery operated and it is easy to pull out or small quick trim jobs, but to trim my whole yard it just does not cut it. I am not satisfied with this purhcase."
2,Disappointed,"Even with the battery fully charged, the Worx GT WG150 doesn't hold the charge long enough to edge 100 ft. The power, even when starting with fully charged battery, is poor - doesn't do a very good trimming job. The result is ragged."
2,DON'T BUY IT!,"The Worx trimmer is light weight, telescopes, swivels, and would be an awesome trimmer if it just had power. This trimmer is a gutless wonder and I don't recommend it even to the light user! I mow every 4 days so my trimming is not overgrown! I think a weed w/ a heavy stem would stop it in it's tracks. It couldn't even handle a little grass and as a edger was even worse. I'm so disappointed; don't buy it."
3,Finally a trimmer I can use around the yard !,"I must admit I did not expect much and the Worx GT did exceed my expectations in that respect. I was looking for a cordless, light electrical trimmer to trim the fence area around the pool and other difficult spots around the house. I am happy with it. It does the trick, and while not as powerful as a gas trimmer, it is good enough for me.I bought two batteries, and I am glad I did as each gives me about 1/2 hour of trimming. One battery does not do the trick. I just love the light weight and being able to trim without getting tired."
2,Worx GT just ok,"Worx GT reviewPros:1. Shaft is adjustable to height, but is more for a shorter body.2. Unit is light weight3. Unit is easy to run.4. Easily adjusts from weed whack mode to edging mode.5. Battery is easy to change.6. Handle is easy to adjust.7. Used as a Weed Whacker does a good job.8. Not needing electrical cord is convenient.Cons:1. String does not automatically adjust, has to be pulled to length.2. Battery only lasts about 15 minutes, strong only for the first 8-10 minutes or so.3. Not really made to be a commercial trimmer, best suited for home property use.4. Not a good option to edge along hard surfaces that have not been previously edged, but is good as an upkeep after a real metal blade edger has been used to first cut edges. Unit does not cut into dirt very easy or quickly.5. For jobs longer than 15 minutes, multiple batteries are required."
4,Worx Great for my needs,"Having a small yard, the Worx Gt works great for me. Light weight and easy to handle. Does a very good job on edging. I have done my yard twice now and am still on the first charge of the battery. I have bought products from TV ads before and have been burned. Would I buy this product again? You bet I would!"
3,Batteries are a chronic problem,"The trimmer itself is good, and the ability to convert the trimmer to an edger is a plus. But their batteries are a constant problem. In fact, if you go to their website, they have a battery analysis program that eventually tells you whether you get a free replacement battery. I finally gave up after my third battery and bought another model of trimmer. From my experience, the one year warranty on their batteries is simply not enough. Be prepared to spend $$$ to buy a battery if you plan on keeping the trimmer long term."
3,Does it Work?,"Well yes, it does work, and is probably what one could expect for $59.00, but it does not come close to the claims made in the infomercial selling it for $99.00 plus shipping. Twice around a football field? Maybe if it isn't trimming grass, and the operator is running. Expect 15-20 minutes moderate cutting at full charge, and be sure to run it completely down the first few times before recharging to ""break in"" the battery. I needed it to trim a 4' highx150' long steep bank where a conventional trimmer will give your back a real work over. This it will do if you don't let the grass get too high. Its light weight and fully adjustable cutting deck are a big plus for hard to reach surfaces.I think the supplied twisted line will cut better the the solid round on the third party reels available separately, and they're 15' long also. So look at your job, and decide for yourself"
5,Love it,If anyone needs someone to help them get over a friendship that has broken up and you don't know why then this is the book to read. Sent to two of my friends that had a recent break up with a longtime friendship.
2,Early Kim,"This is an early movie for Kim. It is a sad tale of country life, a down and out husband and Kim wanting something better. It is fun to see this future star, with very long hair and timeless beauty, who went on to fame and fortune."
3,So-so,"It does work. By connecting an adapter to each computer in your home and using your computer's network setup wizard, you are able to share your dial-up connection. I am operating on Windows XP, and so far it has worked well. The connection speed is a bit slower but overall it's pretty nice. The only problem I've had with it is you aren't able to connect to the internet and still use your home phone as stated by the product."
2,Very superficial,"This seems to be written with the view that most managers are morons - when it comes to technical details. I needed much more than the superficial coverage that this book provides. And if you are, like I was, looking for a book that explains concepts without specific references to vendor implementation then this is not the book for you. I don't want to be in a position where I have to constantly worry about whether the author is not being biased about implementation quality - because, believe me, standards are implemented with wide latitude."
5,A Great Book,"Don't listen to whoever said to buy my book instead of Anne's. You want them both. The difference: Anne's book will help you with your immediate needs. Not only does she explain web services, she names names: protocols, vendors, specific products. It's the guide you want on your desk for quick reference.My book, Loosely Coupled--The Missing Pieces of Web Services, is a complimentary book. It will give you the bigger picture, help you develop a web-services strategy, and manage web-service projects. It's more of a sit-down-and-read-it kind of book.Anne focuses on what you can do today. I go more deeply into the challenges of what she calls ""Advanced Web Services."" Get 'em both!"
3,Barbara Cartland: Five Complete Novels,"I have no problems with any aspect of this transaction, which was excellent in all areas.RegardsColin"
1,This is the worst romance book I have ever read,"The book starts out with promise, all of the stories seem to. By the end of all the stories, the woman can't even talk without stammering and they ""magically fall in love"" if you want to read a romance book just to laugh at how stupid it is, read this"
1,Sticky Tracks...Returned it,"I've been going to a pilates trainer for a couple years, and maybe I'm just used to the pilates reformers that cost thousands of dollars, but I thought this was awful - the tracks were very sticky. I got on, pushed out with my legs, and the carriage just stopped - it did not try to move back in as I bent my legs. I returned it and got the higher model, the Premiere XP. The tracks are still a little sticky, but much better than this one - at least I can use it!"
5,Never done with.,"I used this text in college and it was by far the most informative and easily read text I used. Hats off to the authors and contributors, job well done! I still use this book at work for reference, unfortunately other people feel its a great book and it was stolen. A text well worth replacing"
3,rated ok,i was pleased with the book but was much shorter than i thought. suprised that book was not longer part of her life.
5,Musings from Gloria,"I enjoyed reading this book. Parts of the book are factual and the rest of it is pure emotion, rich with the author's thoughts, observations and feelings about events in her life, sometimes happy, sometimes funny, sometimes sad. Nobody in life gets to pick the family they are born into. Regardless of her background, Gloria's book is about the struggle we all face, in trying to find meaning in this life with the means that we have and in making it with the best that we've got. Some parts of the book are written like thoughts going through her mind, and like all thoughts, they sometimes retrace their steps back to lead to different conclusions.This is an endearing quick read. Thanks to the author for her honesty."
2,Sick,"Came away with nothing but a low regard for the lady. Amazing that her son, Anderson Cooper, turned out so well with a mother(?) like this. Bed hopping and loss of money not too bright for someone who had had so much material advantage to start with."
4,Mind Candy...,"I wanted this book after reading a commentary by Vanderbilt's son, Anderson Cooper. He was reflecting on how we adults never really like to think about, let alone read about our parents sex lives and his mother asked him to proofread her romance memoir. He played up the more racy parts of the book, which turned out to be the only racy parts of the book.This book is not so much about romance, as it is about a woman finding he own way in the world. Gloria Vanderbilt was, of course, born rich and influential. She ran with the young and beautiful of Hollywood's golden age. She also struggled between being the proper young lady her controlling aunt expected and her desire to be noticed by her self-absorbed and very troubled mother.It is not long or terrible complicated, but it is more moving than I had expected."
2,"Cheap, good for solo-drills, not so good for 2 man practice","This model is cheap and has a cool hand guard grip, but because of this design, the blade itself is a second piece that is attached on, and is broken off very easily. If you are looking for a heavy duty training knife to ""shadow box"" with, then this knife is ok. But, if your looking to do sparring or partner drills with this knife, its going to break somewhat easily, and you will be left dissapointed like I was. Your better off getting the straight edge, which is much better for sparring/2 man drills, because the blade and handle are pretty much ""one-piece"" and the blade wont break off as easily, and if it does, you can easily tape it up without having a bulky hand-guard in the way like this model,I would say pass on this one. Unless someone gave me this training knife for FREE as a gift, I wouldnt get it"
2,You get what you pay for,We bought 4 of these for our dojang as the price was right. 2 of them broke in half within a few sessions. Spend a tad more and get something that doesn't break right away.
3,"Its fake, very fake","Yep, won't confuse this for a threatening knife..... I wouldn't flash this at anyone at a traffic light or in a dark night club though"
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This guy can play very high & very loud. All the time. I'm not impressed. Frenzies are nice & exciting, but every piece? Such an easy way out insults his audience. We hear you, and it ain't pretty! OK, this CD is not bad, just tedious. Showy. I like raw energy, but I'm not convinced by Krakaer's desperate tone. His ideas start out interesting, even funky, but compositionally, nothing develops. His technique, though accomplished, relies on 1 or 2 tricks (shticks) that become predictable, monotonous, and lack subtlety. If you want a true jazz clarinet virtuoso who will knock your socks off with authenticity, zest, warmth, wit, intelligence, and heart, with a band as alive as him, you're better off checking out the old Bechet recordings."
4,Love is definately blind.,I really enjoyed this book. It was so real. Victor is an excellent author and I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in reading novels. It dealt with real issues that people face day in and day out. Two thumps up for Autumn Leaves-Love So Deep!
5,"Great 52"" LCD TV","I've owned this tv almost a month and so far, it's been a pleasure watching. Plenty of HDMI connections, great picture, and not nearly as heavy as I thought.The only thing I would recommmend to someone buying it is invest in a Blueray or Hi-Def DVD player if you like watching movies. I got a playstation3 because it plays blueray disc's and it's a game console for the same price of the cheapest Bluray disc players out there. It will play your old dvd's as well and produce the best picture you can get from them like an upconverting DVD player. Keep in mind not all regular DVD's are the same quality and widescreen versions get the most out of the LCD shape."
4,Need extended warranty,Great t.v. But had a problem with the switch and had to have service just after the mfg. warranty expired. I recommend using a credit card that doubles your warranty. American Express paid the $350 repair bill. I was very pleased with A. E.
5,"Samsung LNT5265F 52"" 1080p LCD HDTV","Samsung LNT5265F 52"" 1080p LCD HDTVI'm really enjoying my new Samsung LNT5265F 52"" 1080p LCD HDTV The quality of the picture is the very best. I can not get anything done anymore because I'm always watching it. The price I paid was worth every penny."
3,Amazon lying on description,"Nice tv set, works well so far. The universal remote does not seem to be able to operate a comcast box but overall good4 stars. That makes an average of 3 stars because amazon gets 2!!! My tv was supposed to be in mint condition and refurbished. When I got it I discovered tons of scratches everywhere on the panel and surrounding plastic, there was brown taped all over the set which took hours to remove and the batteries of the remote were dead! Add to that the $150 price drop 2 days after I ordered and you get a real feeling that you made a poor deal."
2,Nice but..,"Good LCD, but several vertical lines appeared after a year of average use. The tv gave off so much heat that there was no need to turn on the heater for the media room. Picture was good when new"
5,I am loving my Samsung,"This forum was extremely beneficial to me in my decision making, so I wanted to give my opinion. I was stuck between the Sony and Samsung, and I finally went with the Samsung, which at the time on Amazon was several hundred cheaper than the Sony. I just got my DirecTV HD receiver installed today, and the picture is unbelievable. I even caught my wife watching golf in HD this afternoon. The price, the delivery and the product were all first rate. Thank you Amazon. I would not hesitate to recommend this TV and Amazon for a great buying experience."
5,"Samsung 52"" LCD TV",Excellent TV. The delivery was great. 1 day earlier than expected. they called 3 days prior to confirm with me about my availability. Set up the TV in a room upstairs. The TV itslef is excellent and the price I paid was unbelivable. I am very happy with my purchase and with Amazon.
1,Don't buy from Out of the Attic,"I never received the TV from the merchant, Out of the Attic, and after three attempts to contact them, they still never responded. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money, though. I noticed another customer review with almost the exact same problem, but I gave the merchant one more chance. Well, it looks like I've confirmed that this is either the most unreliable merchant or they don't even exist. I strongly caution anyone from buying from them, and I suggest Amazon drop them as one of their merchants."
1,Lousy line feeder,You will spend all your trimming time removing the line spool to get the line out. It breaks off and remains inside the spool. Otherwise the trimmer has good power. Very dissatisfied with this product.
3,not exactly Karres,"The original ""Witches of Karres"" was purely delightful. I've read and re-read it many times, and will continue to do so. I was excited to see a sequel, but it just didn't measure up. The writings show the influence of the three authors. Captain Pausert unfortunately is rather bumbling and hasn't attained full wizard-hood, despite the title. After reading it, I felt a strong desire to sit down and write a proper sequel myself."
2,Disappointed......,"....but it would have been hard not to be. This sequel to one of my childhood favorites, The Witches of Karres, totally lacks the charm and subtlety of Schmitz's writing style, and the characters behave in ways that don't gel with their original characterizations. The Leewit crying because the circus tent wasn't completely set up? Give me a break! There are some good plot ideas, but the execution of them just doesn't measure up."
3,It's okay,"This is a pleasant re-visit with beloved characters from the first book, ""Witches of Karres"" by James H. Schmitz. That's about it. Mr. Schmitz died in 1981, so this is someone else's take on his story and characters. Read ""Witches"". Really. It's a great, old-fashioned sci-fi romp with one truly upstanding hero trying to do the right thing surrounded by the somewhat amoral, occassionally immoral, and downright scum of the galaxy. ""Wizard"" tries hard to live up to the appeal of ""Witches"", but is merely an imitation."
3,not as great as the simpsons at all....,"in my opinion, the simpsons is the best cartoon show ever to be shown on TV. When my friends showed me Futurama and said it was better then the Simpsons, I had to not agree with them. Same with Family Guy. The Simpsons is funnier then Family Guy."
5,Futurama: Season 3,The original series of Futurama entered it's 3rd season. This season shows the Planet Express crew having their usual adventures in the year 3000. This season of Futurama was the usual hilarious antics of the characters does make this a pretty good product to get. I highly recommended for most people who want a good laugh.
5,The best one I have had,After having bad experiences with cheap products this Torso Head is perfect for me to work at the gym.
1,Suprisingly Poor Quality,I purchased this wheel from Amazon thinking I'd be getting the highest quality ab roller available. What I got was a device that does not roll smoothly; it sticks at several points in it's rotation (and lubricating it does not help). The wheel also possesses a few small rust spots. Since I order from Canada and pick up in the US returns are a massive hassle for me so I still have it and it sits useless in the corner while a cheaper ab wheel I had before gets used.Not recommended.
2,Something for a quick read,"This is the final part of the Jet Set Wives miniseries. It tells the story of Lucy Blayne and Marcus Canning.Lucy has finally divorced her cheating husband, is in debt and being blackmailed.Marcus decides it's time to get married and be a father, therefore he proposes to Lucy.In all honesty, can't say that this will go into my favourite list of books by Penny Jordan. Have read better previous works. Believe me as I have the whole P Jordan collection.When I read books by P Jordan, I like those which tug at the heart strings and have me rooting for the hero and heroine. Unfortunately, this book left me cold and I could not really see any character development. Which is a pity as I was eagerly looking forward to this book after reading about Lucy and Marcus in ""Bedding his Virgin Mistress"".This is just for a quick read to pass the time."
2,Poor construction,"I liked the swords well enough until on the third or fourth use, the handle and the hilt got loose. I recognize that these are wooden swords, but I have one of similar construction which I have had for 14 years, and it is still perfectly intact and the handle/hilt are still tight. I will not be purchasing swords from this group again."
2,Poor Quality Wood,I was very disappointed in the quality and workmanship of this item. I definitely would not recommend it.
2,A dark side to Enid Blyton,"As a child I loved the adventures of the Famous Five.Recently I read this book and was somewhat appalled. Enid Blyton has been criticised for sexism, elitism and racism. I can now see the first two faults in this book. George is a tomboy, and says to Jo, another tomboy, ""You're as good as a boy."" Out of the Five, Anne is the only real girl, and in this story she plays a very minor role. She misses out on the real action. The lower class paper boy is treated with condescension by the author. There is also a disturbing level of violence directed towards Jo in this book. She is beaten by her father, and twice by Dick. Although Dick beats her by mistake, she still gets injured.On top of this, she doesn't mind when Dick beats her, because she likes him. This is a very unhealthy state of affairs.As usual the action is gripping,but the author's anti-social attitudes are a real worry."
1,The Best of W.C. Fields?,"This DVD, ""The Best of W.C. Fields"" is an insult to the man and his fans alike. There is no excuse for the awful sound and poor picture quality. The intrusive loud hum on the soundtrack makes it impossible to enjoy these classic Fields shorts. The company that released this DVD is called ""Platinum"". ""Lead"" would be more appropriate. The fancy packaging notwithstanding, this DVD has the hallmarks of a bootleg product. Buyers beware of knock-off products that take advantage of your love of the classics. Do your research and, by all means, read reviews at Amazon."
3,Misleading but beautiful,"Being familiar with some of Robbin Obomsawin's other books, I bought this book expecting detailed house plans and handcrafted log architecture. After all, it's called ""The Arts and Crafts ***Cabin***,"" right? And the picture on the front of that beautiful stained-glass door shows logs, doesn't it?Well, this book is beautiful. You'll drool over the pictures. but a planbook it's not. And a log-building book it's not. And none of the residences here would qualify as a ""cabin,"" most are opulent estates. There's nary a plan in the entire book. And almost none of the houses shown are built with logs as a primary element. Most are timberframes; many pictures show no log elements at all!If you want to learn a bit about Arts and Crafts architecture or decorating, you may find some ideas here. But if you are designing a floorplan for a handcrafted log home and want it to have an Arts and Crafts feel, unfortunately, this isn't the right book."
5,Mom's review,"As I have stated previously, my 7 year old grandson is extremely Cars crazy. He always has something from the Cars paraphenalia in the cart at Amazon and is busily saving his money so he can buy it. I love the fact that I can use this to teach about saving for something he desires, and shopping for the best price. That is the only aspect about this toy that is educational, but you use what you can to teach, right? All my grandchildren play with the toys so it must be durable, safe for little ones, famous, a lot of fun to play with, etc. This toy fits the bill very well."
4,Trouble in Paradise&#65533;.,"All Nick Seven wanted after he retired from the CIA was to live a normal life, running his restaurant/bar in Key Largo. He had almost been able to live with the loss of his love, killed years ago, by his arch enemy, Lavender. But the past wouldn't let him go. Was Lavender really dead? And worse, he no longer knew who he could trust. When his re-assembled ""team"" started to fall apart, he had to face the unthinkable.This is a very well written story that is really almost two stories in one. Just when you think all is well that ends well, you and Nick are drawn in once again, into some unfinished business. Could he survive one more time? And could he protect Felicia, the Barbadian beauty he had come to love?I just wish the book was longer... I wanted more! Hopefully, Tim Smith will continue to entertain us with many more stories of ""Lucky"" Nick Seven... the newest member of heroes to join the ranks of Dirk Pitt, and Ben Gannon."
1,Plant Died,Plant died in a month. Nothing else to write.I am very unhappy about it.this is the second plant.I will not ever buy from this seller again.
2,Dissappointed,They were about 6in tall when I first received them. Planted them in some gardening soil I mixed with the local soil. It was really taking off during summer but I forgot what I did but it basically died. About a week later it came back and really went after it. Mostly probably because I had a better bedding for it. Then the temperatures dropped to around 40 for our mild winter months and the growth basically stopped. Then our first 32 degrees came and then it just completely died. I didn't mulch it considering I wouldn't have to with our climate since it says it can withstand negatives and it will only get a little under 30 here if we are lucky. I am sure it will grow back but expected more.
4,i ordered a basjoo..,i ordered a basjoo and it came on time. But when i got it it was like it had been rolled and the leaves were a yellow green and all were bent. After a few days i commented to the supplier its status and asked for a replacement as the plant was not growing and looked damaged.They quickly responded and sent me a replacement.Im thinking someone was not careful when packaging.Im just glad it was not dead when it arrived.In the end im just excited to be growing a basjoo in new england!Update: 11/14/2011Both my original and replacement have added a couple leafs. I was able to nurse the first one back to health and is now doing quite well in my indoor garden.
1,The entire CD ranges from 4 to 5 out of 5.,Short on time but if you liked Girls Just Want to Have Fun then you'll love this collection. Not because the rest are similar but most are better.
4,20 Years Of The Rippingtons,"I have been listing to the Rippingtons since the begining of thier career.And The Rippingtons 20th Anniversary CD/DVD is really great!They are still sounding better then ever.I love listing to the new songs, and the 20th Anniversary Bonus is a Nice way to end the CD. and I also love to watch the DVD.I hope that The Rippingtons keep making music for meny years to come."
2,Now this is annoying....,"Should have taken heart to the reviews that mentioned the difference in volume! At first, I thought I could adjust...after all, I was usually asleep by the end of the 1st piece. However, I have to crank the volume up so much in order to hear the subsequent selections that it makes the 1st one really annoying now. Because, after a couple weeks I'm not falling asleep during the 1st selection.I'm ordering Michael Allen Harrison's ""Nightingale Lullaby"" CD; I love his work and the samples sound like something I could sleep with...and sleep and sleep...it may not be ""science"" but I'll settle for magic!"
3,A bit academic,"This is more a scholarly text than a fun read. I like more anecdotal stuff about the eccentric, humorous, quirky modern day Shakespeare."
5,Love the Inkspots!,"I love the Inkspots and their music, even though I don't think that any two of their CDs contains all of the same singers. The Inkspots were always coming and going. One guy would sing on one album, then he would leave or pass on to a greater venue, and another guy would take his place. One CD features a very young Ella Fitzgerald track.But all in all, the music and the style, regardless of the various replacements of the original singers, stand the test of time. Nice, comfortable music to listen to...and to remember by, if you are old enough. Which I am."
4,Good price. Decent Item.,The Rope Dart wasn't bad. I did receive the wrong item at first and Martial Arts Superstore was very helpful in returning it for what i ordered.The only problem I have with it is that the rope itself is very weak. It has started to fray on the ends. Other than that it is a great item for the price. I would highly recommend this item and this seller.
4,"Great CD for Relaxation, Mediation or Yoga workout!",My yoga instructor played this CD in class one night. I decided to purchase it and very happy that I added to my music collection. Its great a help to you for just relaxation or accompany an yoga workout. I highly recommend it.
4,No Scientific Studies that can prove this diet kills!!!!,"No Scientific Studies that can prove this diet kills!!!!Until otherwise stated, I don't see why anyone should follow one person's review of this diet."
1,Seriously! I spent too much money....,"If you don't have the funds for a more expensive filter buy this one, otherwise do your homework! Somebody could have warned me."
2,Still Have New Water Spots,"Starting with a clean shower, I still have water spots. Also, the water pressure is not very strong. It's less pressure than my previous shower head."
3,ehh,I got this because i moved into meridian Idaho. The water was so drying to my skin and long hair. This filter has helped a little but i had to cut my hair short and I still have to struggle to get the brush through my hair. I wish it was as good as all the reviews claimed
3,Haven't changed yet.,"Got this extra filter with the in-line shower filter. Haven't changed yet, Supposed to be every six monthes. It's been two."
3,wavering..,"To be honest, I haven't noticed a huge difference yet. We ordered the new culligan shower-head to go with it and have used the combo. at least a handful times. I guess it may just be a subtle difference and perhaps it'll be a matter of time to see a big difference but for now, it's been a subtle if much improvement at all."
5,Everyone should use this!,"This filter makes a big difference! If you live in the Washington DC metro area, you know that the water has a lot of chlorine in it, which can be bad if you are regularly exposed to it at high temperatures. Before installing this, the smell of chlorine in the water was noticeable. After installing, no chlorine smell and my skin is not dried out."
5,Water softener,We have well water and the family only complained about how their hair was never at it's best. With this shower head and filter they have noticed a significant difference.
4,been using it for 8 months,"Had bought this product after good reviews. in a winter the direct water from shower would make skin scaly and itchy. after using this product, it is a lot better."
4,Why don't you ship this to Canada anymore??,"This product is the only thing I've found that even remotely helps with our very sulfury water (smells particularly awful in a hot shower). No, it doesn't get rid of sulfur smell entirely, but it does help, and I have therefore become pretty dependent on it over the last year or so since I moved into my rural house. So imagine my dismay when I went to order another bundle of these and got a big red ""DOES NOT SHIP TO YOUR ADDRESS"" in the way of my purchase! And it's not just my address that's banned, but multiple Canadian ones I tried instead, so I guess it's the whole country that is off limits.Not cool, Culligan.Yes, I can probably find these same replacement filters elsewhere but they're on sites that are either not as reliable as Amazon, or from reliable sellers/actual Culligan stores that charge a LOT more than they do on here. Please bring back shipping to CA! :)"
5,Great product!,Oraltonin was given to me by my dentist as an additive to my brushing regiment. I just hate flossing so he said to try this twice daily and it will do everything that the flossing will do. My last checkup was outstanding and combining this with the sonic toothbrush gave me an excellent check up! Taste was nice and pepper minty and did not burn like stupid mouthwashes do.
2,"Meh,","Save your money and get TheraBreath; twice as effective, no saccharine aftertaste and costs a ton less.Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)Packaging for oral tonin looks like it was done in a garage; product tastes like a regular commercial mouthwash. Label claims to include a bunch of essential oils but product tastes completely synthetic."
2,USR 5461 SECURITY ISSUE,"There is a firmware error in the USR5461 wherein the adminitrator'sinterface is immediately accessable to anyone on the internal network(e.g., drive-by wireless sniffers) simply by entering the the router'sWAN IP address in the address bar of any browser. It makes no differencewhether or not 'remote administration' is disabled or enabled.If you are using this router, create a new and complex password NOWand change it often. Meanwhile, complain vigorously through email and bytelephone to usrobotics until the error is corrected. They are aware ofthis problem yet, don't seem in much of a hurry to fix it."
2,"Great Text, Poor Translation","I'll be the first to admit the Random House/Modern Library translation is difficult for today's readers, but it is still superior to this compendium of Epicurean thought. That said, don't neglect the few texts we have of Epicurean thought -- once 36 volumes, now reduced to a ""Vatican Library"" -- perhaps because Epicurus was the first materialist, naturalist, and bona fide advocate of indifference to the gods."
4,I feel sooo much better now,My friends and I watch this movie any time we wish to feel better about our lives. This is for entertainment only and in no way to be taken seriously. They don't so neither should you.
3,Something to watch,"It was okay alternate entertainment for an hour or so. The movies was a documentary about the USA at it's worst, unless you're into a documentary about generations of white trash."
3,This is a Love/Hate type of video w/cursing,"Well, It is strange funny, and sad, that there really are people who live like this. I consider in a docu-comedy. Lot of cursing, so the kids can't watch it. I was really expecting a funnier movie, not as serious as it was & sad for the people in the movie, At times I felt like just fast forwarding the DVD, but I hung in there. I didn't really get better. I don't think it lived totally up to the hype. Most of my friends watched it after me. Not a lot said about it, usually not a good sign. What else to say? I really waited for this DVD to show up for a good friday night movie, and this ain't it."
1,Do not rent!,This movie was extremely disturbing. I would not recommend it to anyone! It was very gruesome. I had not expected it to be so graphic and bothersome.
4,Fascinating & Disturbing,"I enjoyed this film very much. It was shocking, disgusting, amusing, and sad. I don't know how much acting the Whites did for the camera but most of the film seemed authentic. They never seemed to hold anything back from the cameramen. I was very pleased with this purchase."
2,Little to Redeem It,"If you're looking for a film that idealizes drug use, violence, profanity and promiscuity, then this is the documentary for you. The title of this work is one word too long; there is nothing wonderful about these people. At first, it looks like they are at least a tight-knit, supportive bunch of degenerates. Until you learn that they even victimize each other. I suppose that the film makers tried to stay neutral, and neither praise nor condemn the Whites. But the many scenes of them being cheered on by neighbors, townspeople and even Hank Williams the 3rd have the effect of legitimizing their actions. I really needed to take a shower after watching this. Early in the film,a town official talks about a local kid who just received a scholarship to M.I.T. ""M.I.T.!"" he says, ""Why isn't there a story about that?"" Good question. It would make for a much better movie."
2,Not worth watching,"Not worth watching. First 5 minutes tells the whole story. Doesn't get any better, it just lingers on and on about the White's being proud druggies and alcoholics. Pathetic."
5,The Whites Rule!,This documentary is very good. It makes me want to move to Boone Co. West Virginia. The Whites show you how to live the American Dream.
2,Stupid,"Too ""hicky"" for me. No other way to say it...Why would anyone want to watch a bunch of drugged out felon hillbillies and their silly antics??"
5,Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia,"My wife and I Pay-per-viewed this movie AFTER the kids went to bed, and we loved it! In lineage with Grant Wood's 1930 painting, filmmaker Julien Nitzberg's movie updates the classic American Gothic with a heavy dose of nihilism and a crushed oxycontin. The extended White family may be poster children for everything you think is wrong with everybody else. However, if you can refrain from passing righteous judgement, something every scene baits you to do, you may end up sympathizing with the White family's endless and seemingly self-induced tragedies. They are as much an extreme example of dysfunctional family dynamics as they are an ideal example of true family sovereignty. Nitzberg's humanist approach to what would seem an easy target for cheap reality-tv exploitation lifts this film up to a level of defining modern American prose. An Excellent movie!"
2,waste of time,"I lived in WV... People that live there hate people like the ""whites"" who live off of welfare and consume so much of their time stealing and being ignorant. Don't purchase this. It will only help them get the attention they so badly get. They ruin lives. Just watch the movie, in there the man admitted to robbing gas stations and peoples' homes, even life savings of others'. Simply put, ignore them and let the police and God deal with them. DO NOT BUY. They exaggerate the negative sterotype of W.V. people."
4,Oh my!,This video is like a train wreck that you can't turn away from. I truly wonder if (and how) these folks' lives changed since doing the documentary.
2,Came with the Kindle,I don't know why my Kindle came with this app/book. I'm not a horse person and I have no interest.
4,Pretty good,"It lacks a few tricky behavioral isssues I really wanted to know about; however, great for a beginner or intermediate horse person."
2,Wrong nutrition facts,Nutrition facts say that 1 cup contains 21% sodium.I received my package today and by the time i opened it and read nutrition facts sodium per cup is 38%.Not happy to read misleading info in amazon.Please update the info at least so people know what they buy.
3,basic book c# 2.0,"This is a beginner's book for c# 2.0. Although it has alotof examples in this book, believe that the author shouldhave focused on more quality examples and have less examples.This is not an easy book to go through even for an enthusiastlike me. I believe more structure and more real life exampleswould have been a major improvement to this book."
1,Whoooooooooooooo(pity) dooooooooooo!!!,I can wait to spend $100.00 dollars in a plastic cheap bag because I want to show to my friends that I bought prada!!! whoooooooopeeeeeeeeeeee!!! I'll bet that prada is laughing all the way to the bank since he probably pay the chinese .25 cents to make the bag. Whooooooooo! Peeeeeeeeee WoW!!! I am so exited!!! YEAH!!
1,Either defective or just does not work well???,"This item seemed nice and easy to use right out of the box, HOWEVER...as we used it and it warms up, you loose the range of motion and it is very restrictive. It's like it almost LOCKS up on you. It really hurt my husbands back and he is VERY FIT! We tried it three times and gave up. It went back yesterday for a refund. They may not all be this way, but this one was sure defective."
4,This is alright,"I ordered this thinking it would be easy to do. It is, but if you have any knee problems do not order this. I'm not able to use it more than 3-5 min without limping later. Takes a bit to assemble too"
4,"Easy Assembly, Quiet & Small","Had no trouble putting this together. It is well built, strong and stable on a carpeted floor. Light enough to move around so it needn't be intrusive in small rooms. My only complaint is the foot rests--my heel slips off too easily. Helps to have sharp heeled shoes as opposed to rounded, but the toe straps have to be almost uncomfortably tight. Otherwise, fine little machine. I plan to wear it out!Update 1/7/12: Wore the seat rollers out after less than 1000 strokes. I've alerted Stamina. Standby...."
3,"Achilles heel - Yes, it literally has one","This could have been an excellent machine, except that it has an achilles heel, the footrest.It has a simple velcro strap to hold your foot and that strap along with a narrow heel wall causes your feet to slip out after a couple of workouts.I bought some cheap slip on shoes from kmart and they seem to be holding in the footrest."
4,inexpensive workout,"I am sure purists would not like this inexpensive rowing machine , but for the money you get a good low impact workout in a short time. I don't know how long it will last; no major problems, just doesn't look like it would hold up in a gym for very long. I had a minor problem with the strap holder on one of the foot pads breaking and they replaced it immediately no questions asked. Worthwhile purchase for me, nice to be able to get a workout at home any time of day, and it doesn't take up much space at all, easy to pick up and move in a corner."
4,The shock is leaking fluid,Can I purchase a replacement shock for this rowing machine?I had to put a drip pan underneath it! Now there's hardly any pressure because most of the fluid is gone.
1,Same wheel problem,"Price was so good I had to take a chance. I liked how it folded up for storage too.I had no issue with the foot rests. Like most cardio equipment with footstraps, this one is made to use with shoes, and once I put shoes on, I had no problems with the feet. However, about 3 minutes into the workout I started to hear and feel a grinding on the seat. When I flipped over the machine and took a look at the wheels, I could clearly see where the wheel broken somekind of support washer. I was kind of surprised the grinding came upon me slowly and gradually. When I had read about the potential problem I thought I'd be more of a sudden failure. Anyways, I returned it immediately."
1,Fine if you're tall with big feet,"I usually find the reviews to be really helpful here and have never felt compelled to complain about a product but this machine is just too big for me. I'm 5'4"" and wear a 7 1/2 shoe, my feet absolutely will not stay in the pedals. My knees felt stressed and painful after using the machine for a few minutes and my knee constantly hit the middle track. No matter what I do I cannot seem to get this machine to work well with mw.My husband is taller, 5'11"", and it seems to be fine for him but if your a smaller woman I do not suggest getting this machine."
2,Disappointed,"Just received mine and put it together. First off, like a lot of other reviews, mine also was missing screws needed for assembly.The other problem is that the pedals are absolute junk. I can't keep my feet in them (size 9 1/2 shoes), so the machine is really unusable. Also, one of the velcro straps ripped at the seam in the first 3 minutes of me trying to work out.If the pedals weren't so terrible, I think it would be a nice machine. As it is, I'm going to try and rig something up to hold my feet on.*UPDATE*I've come up with a solution to the pedal problem. I drilled two holes in each pedal and attached a U-bolt. Now my feet stay in all the time and the machine works very well! I have posted pictures of my solution online in case anybody else is having this problem:[...]"
1,junk,"this piece of equipment is cheaply made and difficult to assemble. After three uses the extension arm fell off the unit. I had to call the manufacturer for another arm since the first one was broken.it took a week to get the part. and now I'm not sure if I want to go to the trouble to put it back together.I am considering returning it, but i have to find a shipping box it will fit in."
2,Uncomfortable,"Concept is good, but several of us had to ""tie"" our feet on the pedals in order to keep them from slipping off."
4,Great machine for the money,"I really enjoy this rower! It gives a full body workout. It's easy to use and put together. The only downfall is the seat... it's very uncomfortable after being on it for a while. Other than that, I love it!"
4,worth the money,"I am a woman 65 who has just gone back to work after a year off and needed to build some upper body strength. sturdy enough that my husband uses it too, though he pulls so hard the front end almost lifts off the ground, but hes in good shape and strong. Yes peddles a bit too far away but no big deal, I just dont put my feet under straps. This little rower also gives a good leg workout. Too heavy to keep it standing up so it just goes in extra bedroom. My sister who is 66 bought one first and loves it. Nice little machine for the money."
4,Affordable-Nice Workout,"Easy to assemble. Functions well and is sturdy. There is a dial on the resistance piston that allows you to adjust workout difficulty. I just set it up in front of my TV and get a decent 30 minute workout while watching the History Channel (OK, it was Sponge Bob). I'm new to rowing machines (I'm usually a runner, but a don't like running in the winter), and I was impressed with the total body workout you get with the machine (especially your back and legs). This is an excellent value. Only complaint is the foot pads. The velcro straps loosen during the workout and your feet slip out."
4,small & useful,"This machine is great for apartments. It's too small to overpower everything else in the room (unlike a treadmill or eliptical) but long enough for full extension of the legs and arms. It's beautiful! I haven't had the need to store it, yet, but the way it was packed in the slender box it came in, I have no doubts that it can be stored easily. However, it did take me 45 mins to 1 hour to assemble it so make sure you have time..."
4,Great starter workout for the un-athletic,"I haven't worked out in awhile and I was looking for something to give me more of a total body workout. This rowing machine fits the bill. If you're a serious athlete - especially a rower - this probably won't be challenging enough. I find it very quiet and easy-to-use, I'm 5 ft. 2 in. and will be 60 yrs. old this year. I've only had it for a week, but so far I'm very pleased. I love that it doesn't take up much room in my living room."
1,do not buy if under 6ft tall,unless you are 6 ft tall do not even think of using this. the foot pieces are too far away to even move back on the seat. i am 5ft6. for me they need to be at least 12 inches closer. now what do i do with this
1,Poor Quality,"After three uses, the seat began to make very loud squeaking noises and it shaved metal off the base as I went back and forth. I had high hopes after reading the reviews but this just didn't work. You get what you pay for."
5,Seal of Approval,"I always liked Seal's music, this DVD just makes me like him moreThe Video quality is very good, with nice close ups and nice lighting, The DTS and Dolby Digital sound is Outstanding great bass and nice dispersion of sound. I highly recommend this DVD to those who Like good music and Seal's brand of Rock mixed with R&B;."
1,load of garbage,"What a total waste of money. Nothing worse than music constantly interrupted with talkover , poor presentation just a lot of mouthing off...not even an authorised presentation..rip off"
4,Good calculator,"Excellent calculator, and excellent service. The product came as promised.A good experience."
4,T-92 a little better,"While a ti-92 and a t-89 have the same functionality, the qwerty keyboard on the ti-92 is the only thing I miss. This calculator is a must have for advanced chemistry and calculus."
5,TI-89,"In perfect condition and extremely useful calculator. Came with batteries that quickly ran out, but apart from that, it was exactly what I needed."
2,I think you sent me a broken one,"This was purchased for use in AP Calculus class.After inserting the new batteries, the calculator would turn ON but as soon as I touched any buttons, the screen went blank.Have been unable to use it."
3,Why don't you tell me where it was made?,"Jesus!the calculator was made in China...I am in China but I spent 210 bucks to buy Chinese good from USA!Aren't I a fool!Why don't you tell me that it was made in China?Although the calculator is sort of exorbitant,it is amazingly useful.It seems,with TI89,I don't need to think about math computation any more,the only thing I need to do is to type in equations and data.My father said this will make me more and more clumsy on math problems.I don't know whether he was right or not,but I do think that with so useful a calculator ,my math skill level will drop a lot according to Chinese standards."
4,Awesome calculator but quite complicated at times,"the reason i gave this calculator a 4 out 5 is because even though this calculator will do absolutely anything you want it to do, it is because it took me a while to get used to how the keys were position and also the 300 page book that comes with it does not do it justice ou should really download the one on the cd. also putting the games and other things is kind of taking sometime for me to figure out but i only tried it ocne so im sure ill get the hang of it soon. but i would defenitely recommend this to anyone. just to dont get it the day before the SAT and expect a miracle because you will not get it. the calculator will do anything btu you have to know how to input it. definately BUY IT"
5,Perfect,I bought this calculator for college and it is probably one of my better investments. It's a little confusing at first if you have been using something like the TI84 but if you play around with it a little bit you can figure it out. It's perfect for my calculus classes.
5,"Still the best, even with its shortcomings...","While I actually agree with several points in the ""one star"" reviews of this calculator, they fail to provide an alternate calculator that has the universal acceptance and support enjoyed by the TI-89. Yes, the processor and memory could be faster... Yes, the display really should be on par with a Blackberry... Yes, the equation entry area could be larger... Is it sad that most hand held devices handily beat the TI-89 in terms of processing power, its display and ease of use? Definitely. Nonetheless, the TI-89 will continue to hold the ""gold standard"" position until we see a calculator on par with modern portable device technology. Even TI's latest creation, the Nspire, is a sorry excuse for an upgrade. That's why I give the TI-89 Titanium 5 stars as there does not yet exist a worthy competitor to it, even within the TI company itself."
5,Perfect,"This literally is so good with calc that it should not be allowed. It gives unfair advantages because you can essentially purchase a grade. its good when you have money to blow. not necessary at all for a student, just makes life easy."
4,TI-89 Titanium,"I love the calculator, it's only real downside is the fact that the letter size in display is pretty small and not adjustable. Only took me a week to shift to this system from TI-83 Plus."
3,Not as good as the previus one,"Two years ago i bought the average TI-89, and, it was awsome, the only problem that it has was its lack of memory, so when i knew that TI was going to release the Titanium instantly i ordered one, and when it arrived i test it with several integrals, and some other math problems, and at the begining i was shocked because the high speed of the titanium, but later when i started to introduce harder integrals that the titanium couldn`t do it, i notice that my old and slow TI-89 could do some of the integrals i was so disapointed, and finally i sold it. Now i`m still using my old TI-89 (i prefer to have an answer even if i have to wait for it)"
5,Got what I paid for,"As you all know this is an amazing TI calculator, in my opinion it is the best.I was more worried about the seller, but I got what I paid for 2 days before the last ship date. The calculator was used (as it was meant to be) but it is fully functional.I paid 100 bucks for a lightly used 160 dollar calculator. I'd say this is a 5 star bargain.EDIT: They included batteries. Wasn't that nice? That is def. 5 star worthy."
4,TI calculator,This was a gift for my Physisist son and it saves him a lot of time with formulas. He is very happy with it
1,"This is not the same item in the picture, I feel cheated and robbed the software doesnt work","This is not the same item in the picture, its seems very old it doesnt even have TI 89 titanium marck, I feel like I orderd a different product, I would not recommend this seller to another person, this is a direct form of steeling form a person.Im not happy with the purchase I want to give this back the problem is that I live in Colombia, and this is not easy Im not a rich person so Im feeling very bad about this trasaction. You should not sell a defectous item, mucho more selling a different item than the one appering in the picture."
5,TI-89,The best calculator of the TI family is definitely the TI-89. Used great for physics and math and calculus now any class!
4,Good value,"I have been using this shower head for a few weeks now and I think it's working out really well. I've noticed that the shower smells better, my hair feels cleaner, and my skin looks better. I think the price point for this product is good, and I like the way it looks. It's very sleek. The installation was simple; it took me about 10 minutes."
3,Not my favorite,"While I like this showerhead, I will probably end up buying another one. The coverage is not that great, leaving the ""outside"" of your body cold. I'm a small person at that. I do like the different functions, but it is difficult to twist the head to change the setting to your favorite. Sometimes I just go with whatever it has been left on rather than mess with it. If I were you, I would keep looking. This showerhead is functional, but not the best."
2,Wimpy Shower,"I was hoping for strong water pressure, but got a gentle rain instead. That was disappointing. It's not my plumbing its the wimpy new showerhead. Oh well, I'll have to buy someting else."
5,The shipment was so fast!,"I ordered this showerhead last night at 4pm and I received it at 1pm today! I wish all of my shipments came that fast!.. I used the showerhead today and it was very easy to install. I bought this showerhead because I've been having sneezing fits after long showers. I think I have an allergy to chlorine. Anywho, I will continue to use this and report back soon."
2,Low Water Pressure,The shower head worked great for about 3 weeks. The water pressure dropped drastically after 3 weeks. My daughter said she had more water pressure in the showers are girls camp. Very disappointed to waste the money for only 3 weeks.
2,Showerhead wouldn't stay adjusted,"Looks like it probably filters very well, but I couldn't get the showerhead to stay adjusted at various angles after moving if that makes any sense no matter how tight I tightened it down. Tried ordering a replacement and it did the same thing. Will try a different brand."
5,Great Product!,"This product has changed the life of my hair and skin. I had been experiencing very bad dry hair and skin since moving into my new apartment. This shower head put an end to all that! It was very easy to install, I simply had to unscrew my previous shower head then apply a little of the tape that was included with the packaging of my Culligan and voila! Every couple of months you replace the filter and your product is as good as new. Since purchasing, I've seriously told my mom, aunts, friends, co-workers, random people on the street (okay just kidding here) about this product because if you live in an area where the water sucks, it really does help. Anyways, hope my rant (review) was helpful! :)"
2,Didn't work for me,"Fort Worth water is not good water - its very hard water. It dries the heck out of my hair ( which is thick, brown, wavy). I wish I could share the glowing reviews, but alas, I have not yet found a cure for my dry, brittle hair that has been suffering from mineral deposits.- Water pressure: For a filtering shower head, this delivers great water pressure. The massage setting is almost like a swedish massage.- Smell: It reduced some bad smells from my water, not all.- Chlorine: I can smell that the chlorine has been significantly reduced.- Other minerals: still present.I can see that for a medical purpose, this would be a good shower head, but it seems to filter only chlorine, and not the other junk. For a cosmetic purpose it did not work."
2,Nothing especial,I bought this by reading the positive amazon reviews; but it is not as good as they said. I actually bought this for my dry skin. I have been using it for a month and I am not seeing any improvement in my skin. I am very disappointed:)
4,Good Job,"Been using this shower head for about three months.My shower water doesn't smell so the only way I can tell if the shower heads' doing anything is to look at any changes with my body.Within the first week of use I noticed that my hair is softer, though I haven't changed my hair products. My skin also doesn't seem to dry out as badly. Another thing I considered is that my tub doesn't really seem to build up residue as quickly as before.I've never put on a shower head and thought it would be complicated, but it was very easy - done in 5 minutes.For the price and the effectiveness of the product, I'm pleased with this purchase."
4,Works...but filters don't last,"Apparently my skin and hair HATE chlorine.I noticed that staying in dirrent places across the country had a huge effect on my skin. If I was in a city that uses a lot of chlorine, my hair would dry and brittle (no conditioner can fix it) and I would break out. However, most of the time, after a couple of days I always up with perfect skin.The culligan showerhead gives me perfect skin at home(and it did so in just a couple of days).However, my filter (with one shower a day) lasted about 8 weeks, no where near 6 months (water started to smell, skin started to dry out). Thus, I'm checking out the Aquasana."
1,defective and poor customer service,"The item was defective (cake plate obviously did not sit level). The invoice clearly stated if an item was defective or damaged arrangements would be made for UPS pick-up to return the item. Upon calling the company to make arrangements for the pick up the first question I was asked was ""Would you keep the item for a discount?"" It was obvious they did not want to deal with a return. Also they would not make arranagements for a UPS pick up because ""we have not seen the item yet"". Because I have no need for a lopsided cake stand, I paid to return the item. I finally received a refund 3 weeks later after phoning and emailing. The refund did not include my cost to return the item. My total shipping costs were $20.00 and I do not have a cake stand. Very unhappy with this transaction. The cake plate itself would have been OK if it had not been unlevel."
1,Can't rate since Amazon never delivered it....,"Unfortunately, Amazon ""lost"" this item en route and the replacement wouldn't be shipped for another three months. What a disappointment!"
2,Tip,"Buy the older edition for much cheaper! the 4th edition and the 5th are the EXACT same other than exact page numbers. the 4th edition didn't have the CD but the CD was worthless anyway-- well, it was nice to have but not at all necessary!"
1,free copy for sale,Althought the book is great and I love it I found that the book is actually a free copy NOT FOR SALE THAT MEANS this copies are actually given to people and this persona had the guts to put it on sale but the book say all over in every single pages BOOK NOT FOR SALE
4,great for class,the book arrived in time.. in great condition.. a little bit of highlighting as it had noted before purchase.
4,Looks good.,Like the contrast between the grey car and the red license plate surround.Reflects well at night.Good deal for the price.
2,"boxes, baskets, pots & planters","With the exception of a few projects, ie. shade loving ferns and trug of winter pansies, the book fails to provide a wide selection of beautiful floral arrangements. At best, it shows innovative ways to use old or discarded items as planting containers."
5,Excellant Read,"I didn't want to put the book down. ""Neely Jones"" captured me from the beginning & held me all the way through. Neely is a strong & determined sista who puts up with too much stuff & still handles it with grace & dignity. This is a read thats wellworth purchasing."
4,Not bad,"I'm a huge fan of E. Lynn Harris so I thought that by reading James Earl Hardy, I would be able to add him to my list. But this is only the first book and it wasn't bad at all. I thought Mitch and Raheim's story is unique in the sense that even though they are a gay couple, you can relate to them and put yourself in Mitch's shoes and think from a woman's perspective."
3,The ghost sitter )My name is Danini I go to Richman School,The book The ghost sitter is a good book.It is about a girl named Charlotte who just moved to a new house.She is exsited because she used to live in a apartment and now she lives in a house.But one thing she doesn't know is that the house is hunted.The house is hunted by a little girl.This is a good book to read you should read it.
4,Inspirational and Educational,I personally love the reading of Edgar Cayce. This book is very enlightening and spiritual. A great companion to other Cayce topics.
2,Where is Mathew Mantrell?,I do not recomend this book unless you have nothing else to read. The Wizard in Ryme series started out with the main character being Mathew Mantrell but the author keeps getting side tracked by secondary characters. To make matters worse the secondary characters are not even interesting.
3,Confusing Watching,"Mix of occult, same gender affairs, horror and police drama occurring mostly at the Jewish cemetery managed by the devoted Latinos.A very confusing title (Defying Gravity)-and the easy watching for enjoying a comedy-on-run."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The only part of this that works well is the mirror. The knobs won't turn unless you're gripping them with a towel (and your fingers are small), and the sound quality is so bad it actually hurts your ears."
1,junk,this had dents all in it. The product was cheap and it looked like it was made by a five year old
2,Hard To Use,This radio isn't very great. I don't know how to open the door to the MP3 compartment. This radio stinks.
5,"Great, We Love It!","My daughter got it for her 6th Birthday. She sleeps, eats and walks with it, doesn't want to let go. Very pretty, good quality it seems. Now I want one for my son in blue/green. Probably deep inside I like one for my bedroom too: )"
3,"Cool idea, poor construction","The twilight turtle is a really neat idea. 3 different colors can be used by selecting the switch. I thought it performed color changes prior to purchase. It works well if you use the blue color. Oh, and you will need to put it about 4-5 feet from the ceiling for the constellations to look sharp. I dont know about you but I'm not going to install a tall table right in the middle of the baby room so the stars look better.They need to allow for better range of the lighting"
1,cute but harmfull,"my 18 month old loved the twilight turtle ,that is until a part of the plastic shell broke and cut him , (3 stiches), a good nitelite for infants , but by no means is it a toy for older babies. buyer beware"
1,Most over-hyped item i have purchased at Amazon,"This is the dumbest thing I ever bought. I thought the lights automatically change and that it had music. If that were the case, i could justify may spending $[...] on it. All it has is static color lights you turn on and can't turn off. It has a hard shell so my daughter can't play with it. It is boring and useless. Don't waste your money"
5,Definitely a Keeper,"I am so glad that I purchased this for my daughter. It's much better than a nightlite and I think it actually makes her feel comforted to be able to look up and see a light that's nowhere near as bright a nursery light or a nightlite. I love it, however I can't say that I agree with the amber light setting, it doesn't show very well in her room and we have white walls, but the green is beautiful! Overall, I highly recommend this product, it's one of those things that I'm glad I took a chance on!"
2,Happy son unhappy mommy!,This turtle worked great for 3 months and than the green and blue light went out and I can't fix it I also can't get in it to change the batteries very disappointed!!!!!
5,Ladybug Nightlight,This is a really cute night light. I bought it for my infant as it matches her room. But my toddler who is 3 really gets a kick out of it and loves to look up at the stars and moon. All in all - very worth it!
5,Wonderful!!!,My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this. She has a tent over her bed and when she turns on the turtle it's like her own mini planetarium. She loves it and we think it's just wonderful so much so that we bought her the twilight lady bug because she is a lady bug fanatic. I highly recommend this product for any age. I think even a baby would love looking up at the stars.
4,Great bed-time diversion,"My daughter didn't really take an interest in this until she was about 18 months old, then she started to pay attention to the stars on the ceiling at bedtime and even asks for 'stars' if I don't turn the turtle on as soon as the light goes off.As other customers have pointed out - in order for it to work reasonably well you have to have the turle a certain distance from the ceiling, and in the center of the room which for most people isn't practical as they don't have a tall piece of furniture in the middle of the floor. I make due by placing the turtle on a small ottoman in the middle of the room - the stars are a little blurry because it really should be higher up and closer to the ceiling, but my daughter doesn't know the difference and enjoys the stars anyways.I would definitely recommend this not for little babies really but children of toddler age and older."
5,Love Ladybug,My daughter loves the twilight constellation night light ladybug. We love to look at the stars and the moon while we are going to sleep.The only thing that is bad with this item is when the light bulb goes out you can not replace it you need to buy another one. This is the 3rd one in the last 1.5 years. Our daughter loves it so we will keep buying:)
1,ladybug night life pillow,Not well made. overpriced. The turtle was a much better product. It cast a much more interesting illusion on the ceiling.
4,Cool little Turlte,"This cool little turtle helps my one year old boy get off to sleep when he is having trouble. It illuminates his room very well and is very dreamy. The turtle is soft with a reasonably hard shell, but not too hard for the young ones to hurt themselves. 3 colors to choose from, red, blue and green."
3,Cloud b Twilight Pink Ladybug Night Light,"My grand daughter loves to watch all the stars, etc on her ceiling and walls while she lays in bed before falling to sleep. The light goes off after about twenty mminutes"
3,Okay... Not as Great as I had Expected,"If you are looking for something that has three buttons and simply projects light through the cut outs of stars on its back in three different colors, that is what this is. Maybe other people expected this, so they weren't disappointed, but I had expected more based upon the description and all of the positive feedback.I felt that although this is definitely cute if you are just looking for a neat nightlight for your kids, it is pretty cheaply made and isn't as exciting as described. I was also under the impression that it made sounds and told a story, but there is simply a little booklet included with the ladybug. It isn't necessarily the manufacturers fault that I misunderstood the description, but I thought I would clarify this for others.Summary:This has a cheap plastic ""ladybug"" shell and three buttons that project light through the cutout starts on the ladybugs' back. Don't expect any more than this."
3,eats batteries,My kids put it on every night and I find that I replace the batteries about once every 3 months. Otherwise the love it.
5,Best Nighttime Sleep Aid Ever,"I got this for my daughter when we were having a new baby since they'd be sharing a room and my daughter always kept a light on. This was one of the best kids' purchases I've made in a while. We've had it for almost 2 years now and have only had to change the batteries 3 times and that's with daily use. The stars and moon are bright and the different color options ensure you can find a color that will be bright in any room. Our fave is purple. My daughter usually has to press it once more before falling asleep. It does not play music. The stars don't move. Where are you people getting your info? It's not supposed to. It is the best nightlight ever. It keeps my daughter's attention at bedtime and soothes her. The baby, now a toddler, fell in love with it, so here I am buying our second. My daughter's friend has the turtle at home and since she saw our ladybug has been bugging her mom for one. This is a sure winner with ages baby - 10."
4,Just what I needed,"My 3 1/2 year old grandson was having trouble sleeping and I thought this might help. He loves it and uses it at nap time, too."
4,Start turtle: a must have!,"My son adores this toy. When the lights are off, the stars shoot all over the room - not just the ceiling. He loves to change the colors, and its 45 minute timer is a great touch. It gives a little night light for when he falls asleep, but the timer keeps the batteries lasting a long time. Totally worth any price, and it wasn't too much to start with. Extra bonus! I can also see this as a great educational toy when he gets older, so we can learn about the constellations. The package comes with a booklet of all the different constellations that are included. This is a great nursery room addition."
2,"Star shaped night light--yes, but forget learning contellations","I was eager to get this starry sky night light for my granddaughter for Christmas, so I just tried it before wrapping it. Both my husband and I are dismayed that the turtle needs to be placed closer than the 5-6 ft. from the ceiling to see enough to look for constellations, and even then, the stars are all the same size ( unlike the photo shown when I searched Amazon), making it MUCH harder to detect the constellations with the turtle than it is in the real sky! Pretty bad for a toy we're told will teach kids 8 constellations. I just spent 30 minutes piling boxes up in the middle of my big living room and lying on the couch searching for stars I know well. Found one--maybe two--only. This may be a cozy night light, but it's badly designed for finding any stars."
2,Doesn't last....,"This really is pretty cute and neat the way it lights up the ceiling with stars. However, unfortunately it didn't even last a year before all but one of the lights went out on it and it wasn't used that much. They are LED lights inside which if were of a decent quality should have lasted for years. The paint on the shell also scratches pretty easily. For these reasons I have to give it two stars since it is just going to take up space in a landfill."
3,Nice idea but could be better,"I got this at my baby shower and was excited but that died quickly when I realized that it has some flaws.Pros:1) Different brightness settings2) Actual constellations3) Cute!Cons:1) No option for how long you want it to stay on, like the sound soothers by Cloud B2) The lights are stationary, which doesn't always keep baby's interest for longOverall, I like it and so does my son but some improvement could be made and if it broke I wouldn't purchase another."
5,Great night light!!!!,I bought this item for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She had just moved to her own room and has recently become very interested in the night sky. I thought this would aid in sleeping by herself plus she would get to see something she loves indoors. It is really awesome!!! The red doesn't show up as well but that's totally fine by us. We prefer the blue anyway. I love that it has the timer on it and stays on for quite a while after she goes to sleep. I would definitely recommend this to others. She loves it and shows it to anyone who comes to visit.
2,Stopped working after a couple of months,"My son loved it until it stopped working after a couple of months of use. Two of three LED's are no longer functional. Manufacturer did not reply to emails. Don't let the pictures and text fool you, it looks nice but this is just cheaply made crap that breaks during normal use. What a waste of money."
4,Kids love it.,"My four year old loves this turtle. He likes to use it to fall asleep. I actually like that it shuts off on its own, it may not be appropriate to very young children who would get upset to wakeup and find it off. I just wish it played music then I would give it five stars."
2,Not as expected,"I had been very excited to receive this item, but was seriously disappointed when I turned it on. Not only does the turtle need to be close to the ceiling to see the stars clearly, but it also needs to be near the center of the room. I am considering hanging it from the ceiling by fishing wire!!!! My second complaint is that the shell is plastic and pretty fragile. My son has already broken off a peice of the shell into a very sharp fragment. Don't waste your money!!"
5,Great Toy,"Ok, so I purchased one of these for each of my nieces for Christmas presents and they absolutely loved them. I would definitely make this purchase again."
4,"Nice, but wish it stayed turned on longer","We just put this light in our 15 month old daughter's room (grandma got her the lady bug version). The blue lights show up really well on her walls, and the light seems to help her fall asleep. However, I do wish it would stay on all night. More than once she has woken up panicked in the middle of the night because her night light is turned off. We tried a conventional night light with her and it seemed to keep her up, so it would be great if this soft, soothing light would stay on all night long."
2,overrated,"This thing is sooo overrated. It's not very bright, so the stars don't actually show up on the ceiling, only on the wall right next to it. And the light colors clash with the design of the toy - no yellow or natural light option."
2,It's okay but not captivating,"The turtle lights up and projects stars on the ceiling. That's it. We have the 'endangered species' version, so ours actually has 5 endangered animals on the shell that can be light with a backdrop of light (only lights up on the turtle, no projection) in addition to the 2 color projections of stars.The reality is that this is a very boring, very simple night light. Don't expect anything more. We got it as a gift - I would NEVER spend as much as it routinely sells for. The shell is hard plastic, so it's not like it can be cuddled, either, FYI."
5,Twilight turtle,"What a great night light! I bought this for my 2 year old son, and 5 friends who are all expecting. I thought this would be great for either the new arrivals or their older children (all are around the age of two). My son just loves it. He picks which color stars he wants on before we leave his room at night and it changes almost night. The amber is the softest of the colors but his favorite.So far all my friend's children enjoy it too.. especially the ones that are sharing rooms. The light is so soft you can turn it on without waking the sleeping child."
5,Great!,"This toy was for my 2 year old daughter. She loves it. When turned on, it lights up the whole room walls with different colored stars and a moon. I child sleeps better at night and it fascinates her!"
4,Good product,I wish is stayed on all night! My daughter still wakes up all night long and she would be way less scared if the stars were on all night.
5,Great product A+++,"Great product. My kid loves it, she goes to sleep with it every night. The star project farther than I thought. The light turn off on it's own after awhile. Run really long on batteries."
4,I love these,"when I ordered these items I wasn't to sure what they would be like, but once I got them I was satified with them, I have two little girls and they both have their own in each of their rooms and it helps them to go to sleep...They love them and each need them to go to sleep now..I like the fact that they are plastic and aren't easily broken!!!"
4,Our 2 year old daughter loves this!,My daughter loves to use this while going to bed. We spend time talking about the stars and looking for the moon. I gave it 4 stars because the red is difficult to see on the ceiling and walls. The blue and green are pretty bright and we often use it to read books with all other lights off. It can be distracting at times when all she wants to do is play with her ladybug. I would recommend this to make a child's room more fun at bedtime. It has been helpful getting her used to sleeping in her own bed alone.
3,"Love It, Hate It, Love It, Hate It","We got the turtle for my son and he loved it. It worked wonderfully for the first 59 days and then the off button stopped working and we had to use the switch on the bottom. It didn't seem like a big deal but we had to get another one after two sleepless nights on vacation when we had decided to leave it home. We ordered the ladybug. We gave it to our daughter who was still in the crib and almost immediately we had problems. I contacted Amazon and Cloud B and it was such a hassle to get it fixed. It didn't have a problem all the time and the Cloud B rep was convinced that my 9 month old who was in a crib was somehow playing with it and broke it. Now, that would be impressive. The kids love them so much that my handy husband figured out a way to fix both of them. They work but it is frustrating that we have had so many problems. I'd love to buy them as gifts but I hate to give a bum product to a friend. My kids are still using them after 2 years. They travel well."
4,bed time bug.,"My 3 year old is afraid of the dark. So I bought her this bug light :) She likes it, and I think it's cute. I produces minimal light..enough to light the room, but not too much to keep her up. It also has 3 different lighting options- green, blue and red. Which is pretty cool, because she gets options. Also portable, so she takes it with her to her dad's house.I did have some issues with the battery being overheated when it first came...and then because I didnt read the directions, I couldn't figure out how to turn it on (My 3 year old figured that one out) All in all, quite a cute little light bug."
5,Love this,"Got this for my 1 year old who is now 2. He loves his turtle. He knows the word for stars and askes to turn his stars on before he gets into bed. The stars aren't perfect and are a bit blury but I wasn't expecting it to be either. From reading reviews I think I was expecting it to be worse than it was because people seem to be disapointed in the clarity of the stars and lack of exact positioning of constellations. It's a kids night light, and didn't really expect it to be a planetarium. My son loves it, and I do too. I also like that it has a timer on it so it's not always on."
4,Twilight Turlte,"I purchased the Twilight Turtle as a gift for a granddaughter. It arrived quickly, in great shape, and postage free. The turtle has been a fun learning tool and is used every night by the little girls. As a result of this purchase I am going to buy 2 more for other grandchildren."
2,Out of Focus,"Disappointed because it needs to go in an exact location, both in distance from walls and ceiling, in order to focus properly. Unfortunately, that location seems to be right in the center of the room. Mine is in a ""spa"" room and I'm unable to put a 4' stand in the center; if I could, product would be great."
5,Kids love it - Very good quality,Very good quality item at a very good price. My kids love it.one of the colors(i dont remember now) is very dull but the other 2 are very good.
4,creative gift for a new baby,"I couldn't resist adding the mini-planetarium night light as a gift for my niece's new baby, when I got her a sleep sheep. Way cool."
4,My girl loves this thing.,"My 3 year old girl loves this thing. I take good care of this thing because i don't know what would happen if it broke . Probably have to buy another one and have it shipped one day express. weve had it about two months and still works fine. Bed time is much easier. I am back to edit my review. changed from 5 to 4 stars. My girl used the lady bug for about seven months and it quit working. Maybe she dropped it one to many times, i don't know."
5,"Expensive, but my kids love it.","I tried different night lights for my 3 and 1 year old daughters' bedroom. My husband think the plug-in night light are not safe since the kids can pull it out now. Then I found this turtle night light. We have been using it for more than a month. We all love it, and I have recommended to a few friends with little kids.The only problem we have is I cannot find a perfect place to put the turtle. I can only put it on a top of a dresser."
4,"Nice light display, would be awesome if there were some movement","I bought this for my son's 5th birthday. He really loves it. I think it's good, but I was hoping there would be some movement to rotate or change the star pattern.I didn't realize when I bought it that it was battery-powered, but since it came with batteries, I'm ok with that. Plus, no cord means any of my kids can pick it up and carry it around, and my son can move it around in his room without any problem."
4,Cute as Bug,"I received this item quickly and in new condition as promised. Have not opened it as it was given away for a gift, but I'm sure all is well."
3,Cute but reflects stars only if placed close to the ceiling,"This item is cute. My child likes playing with it. However, it has to be close to the ceiling to reflect the stars, otherwise just think of it as cute toy that changes color with you pressing a button and that gives some light."
3,Cute but..,I was hoping for Brighter LED's it is a cute idea. But if your looking for a true star system check out the Sege Homstar Pro
5,Unique night light,"This was a birthday gift for my 2 year old. It took her awhile to warm up to it but now she is very fond of it. It works as a good night light to help her go to sleep. The lights automatically turn off after 45 minutes. My daughter really enjoys the ability to switch the constellation colors (orange, green, or blue) as every night she gets to pick one. We have the turtle on a dresser by her bed and the stars and moon show up well once the lights are off. Although the turtle has a hard shell, my daughter still likes to sleep with it, as I often find it under her arm after a nap. One last thing to note, when we get our turtle, initially only the orange light would work. A quick check of the cloud b website reveals this is secondary to low batteries. A set a fresh batteries fixed this problem. The turtle and all the different lights have been working well since."
2,Its ok,"I purchased this for my 2yr old, but the only problem is it needs to be in the center of the room on something at least 4-5feet tall in order for the stars to appear clear. If placed on the ground or a low side table it is just a blurr of light."
4,Very nice.,"Not sure about how long it will last, but it was purchased for a baby. The baby loves to look at all the stars that the turtle displays. The shell is hard plastic. Doesn't set itself off from anything that can't be purchased at a major store."
4,Soothing for mom and baby,"We absolutely love our Twighlight lady bug, and we are only giving it 4 stars because I wish there was a way to keep it on all night. Our 8 month old daughter really enjoys it, but get upset when she awakens in the middle of the night and its not on... Wish we could just plug in the thing and leave it on! Otherwise its very soothing, and so cute."
5,Keeping it simple,"When it arrived I was a bit underwhelmed by its simplicity. I guess I thought it would be more high-tech. Obviously I am not the target market. My 4 year old nephew adored it! Because it is simple he can work it by himself. It was by far his favorite Christmas gift out of a literal sea of Christmas gifts. He carried it around everywhere he went, and still does - a month after he got it. My sister says it is helping him to stay in his own bed at night instead of trying to sleep in hers. Wonderful, simple, sweet, useful, favorite toy."
4,Very friendly and easy to use,My son loves to grab the turtle and play with him when it's bedtime. The only thing i wish it did was rotate or move so that the stars would keep his attention and help him fall asleep better. The light output is great on this thing though. It will illuminate an entire room if you set it out in the open.
2,looks like a junk,"I bought this night light as a gift to my 3 year-old niece. I assume that all kids are in love with stars and oceans or cute creatures. So i though this twilight turtle would be the best gift since it has gotten so much great reviews as well and it even suggests ""ideal for ages 3 to adult"". However, it was not so much as i expected it to be - not so dreamy and fascinating. Instead, you cannot even see the constellations clearly at all. there was no music and the light is so faint. the piece just looks like a junk in the room. not too impressed."
5,The whole family loves it,"My son just got this for christmas and we love it! It's light and soft like a stuffed animal. The stars shine brightly all over the ceiling from wall to wall. We like the three colors - dim orange, green and blue. This is a really great item. I wish I had gotten it when my kids were babies."
3,7 year old loved it,"Don't know how it will work out, but the 7 year old who received it was overjoyed. Priceless picture when she turned it on and shouted ""there's the MOON!""."
1,Inferior quality?,"About a month ago, I purchased 2 of those ladybugs for my boys. The kids love them; the only problem is that they seem to be poorly made: I had gotten 2; neither one was very bright; then the green light went out in one, less than one month after having purchased them (apparently you can't replace the bulbs). I went through Amazon and the replacement came in last Tuesday (brighter than the first one); I returned the one with the broken light by mail today - and just now the new one (which was much brighter than the first two) wouldn't turn off nor change colors when pushing the buttoms on the wings. I then turned it off completely and now it won't turn back on at all.As stated above, the kids love them, but I don't want to have to continuously return them, so I am going to research other ones."
5,Seeing stars,Loved the turtle. Gave it to my 3 year old grandson for his birthday. He had to go in the bathroom with the door shut so it was dark so he could see the stars. (more than once) very cute. Good value considering the cost of toys that don't get a lot of use.
1,This item is not the actual cloud b twilight turtle. It was a generic brand.,"I was very disappointed when I received this product and it was not the actual cloud b turtle. The turtle I received played music and looked cheap. Unfortunately, I did not open the box until a month after it arrived. Had I known it was going to be a generic twilight turtle I never would have purchased it."
5,high quality,"We just received this.It well packaged. It is a high quality, wonderful item and I would recommend it to anyone!"
2,As bad as reviews say....,"I really liked the idea of this. It does create pretty stars on the walls, NOT on the ceiling. It does have to be pretty close to the ceiling to get a reasonable effect.I purchased two, and both have a radius of about 3 feet.I place it on my son's night stand, which is pretty tall, and it barely reaches the ceiling.Too pricey for what it does... which is not much.Very disappointed!"
4,Children happy with Easter gift,The Easter Bunny brought a turtle for each of my boys (ages 5 and 9 months). They're great at bedtime or at night when we can lay together and look or count the stars. Highly recommended - just look around for the best price/shipping deal available.
4,Love it! and so does my son-,"The only complaint I have about this product is that it has three colors to select from blue, green and orangey/brown. The orangey/brown is very faint- aside from that my 12 month old LOVES his turtle. He presses the buttons and moves it around, completely fasinated by it."
4,Great product but nixed in shipping,"This turtle is awesome. It even comes with a star guide book. I bought it for my son at 6 months and he loves it. He rarely plays with it, a few snuggles here and there, but right now just uses it as a night light and loves to stare at those beautiful stars. My only complaint is that the top of the turtle shell came nixed from packaging. It was so cute that initially I was very bummed, but with kids I am sure there will be more soon enough.And it should be noted that it only stays on for 45 min, so when he wakes up at night in the dark he has to physically push the button to turn it back on. It would be nice to at least have the option to leave it on for longer."
3,"Good price, not high quality","This is a cute shirt (for weekend wear, not dressy enough for a professional office in my opinion). I think it runs a bit small, I am usually a small but if I had to order this again I'd get a medium. Good price though...I'm not going to bother with the return process for a medium."
1,MISLEADING. DONT BUY,This product description makes it appear as if it is a MACHINE that you can plug into your OBD1 port. IT IS NOT!! ITS JUST A BOOK!!!!!! I AM RETURNING!!!They call it CODE READING SYSTEM!!! Detailed Description leads to believe it is a device.It should be called CODE READING MANUAL!
2,Brings nothing new to the discussion,"The ""theory"" expressed here is really nothing new, and seems like repackaged emotional intelligence and other ideas. The author continually uses personal stories and anecdotal evidence as proof of many of his ideas. While I agree that IQ does not tell the whole story, this book doesn't add anything new or unique to the discussion."
1,Not poison free!!!,"They are lying!!! This spray is not poison free. When it arrived, it had warnings on the can that it was poisonous to domestic pets and animals. I had to dispose of it as I live with my young grandson who has asthma. The company will not return without charging a $5 restocking fee so you cannot get your money back. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,very intense smell but that is about it,I purchased this because I didn't want to inhale all those chemicals. I sprayed a roach with it and went away for a second and when I came back the roach was no where to be found.I understand why it would madke it hart for the insects to breath because it is very intense. In spite of the fact that it didn't work on the roach it defiantely gave me a hard time breathing.
5,Comprehensive & Insightful,"Solid chapters on all aspects of the group, its troubles, controversies, triumphs, from the most noted Beach Boys scholars (Nick Kent, David Felton, David Leaf, Timothy White, Dominic Priore, Tom Nolan, Jules Siegal, Kingsley Abbott), of the last 30 years. A bit detailed but also designed to be a fun read. Diehard fans and new recruits will both dig it."
4,a treasure trove,"Even having read several books and anthologies on the Beach Boys before, there are pieces in here that I had never even heard of. For fans only, of course, but fans should treaasure it."
3,Slow Input,"This is a great calculator, but when you input numbers fast, they do not always register. If you buy this calculator, input 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9 as fast as you can. You may encounter some numbers not registering even though you hear the number click (as if the number was added). This was not a problem with the BAII Plus. This is a huge disadvantage to this calculator."
2,Slow key responding,"First, it's a product review. (Shopping with Amazon has been a pleasure)The design is cool and stylish, but don't be fooled by its appearance, cheap synthetic case too. (can't believe ppl say it is nice! it's not even napa leather) I pefered the hard case as it protects the on/off key. This calculator has turned on twice in my bag.Very hard keys and slow registering, if you have fast fingers and like to enter numbers using both hands like me, then this is not for you. You have to press the numbers one by one slowly to have them registered, i used to work all my Fin. functions on a TI-83(no problem at all) which is not permited for the CFA exam.I hated the Plus Pro after comparing this with the Regular Plus. This calculator slows me down for CFA exam practice problems and i had more than few errors cus of numbers not registering.The manual and function algorithms are very good though, require min. learning curve. Calculation speed is faster than the Reg Plus's."
5,college made easy,This calculator was purchased for the use in an upper level economic statistics class as well as for finance and accounting classes. I have never had a more easy to use calculator that was so useful. I would recommend this calculator for any business major or anyone else who plans on studying a non technical subject.
4,It makes interest theory a lot easier!,"I really like this calculator, especially compared to the regular TI BA II Plus. The buttons feel really nice and it doesn't feel cheap like the cheaper version.My only complaint I have is that sometimes it gets flaky and messes up numbers, so you have to reset it. But in all, it's great and does what I need it to do."
2,"It is good for basic, but not Professional","There are several features missing for this to be considered a professional level financial calculator.No function key display in the LCD panel, so you are not certain which button you have just pressed. Not the most intuitive. I could only get it to show two digits right of the decimal point.It does have many basic keys that would be handy if you need to calculate payments or things like that. Might be a great calculator, just not for me."
1,Bad Experience,"The description was ""Like a New"" but it turns out a very used looking with scrathes all over. Very bad exper.ience"
5,Excellent Financial tool,"Purchased this calculator for a Post graduate course from Boston University for my Masters called Financial Concepts. It is easy to learn computations for Present Value, Interest rate, and cash flow. An essential tool for any accountant."
3,"Ok, not great","I bought it to take the CFA test. The overall look its ok. However, it has a downside. The keys would not take your entries while doing fast calculations. you have to double check every time you press a key to ensure its ok. That is very annoying. If you work in the financial markets and have to make fast calculations, this is defenitely not the calculator for you. I would recommend the HP 17bII+ better."
2,Awful Keys,"Pro: all the financial functionalities as advertised.Con: you have to PRESS THE KEYS VERY HARD. This is not as small a problem as it sounds. With TI's graphing calculators the keys are much softer. With this one it's incredibly easy to miss a digit or two when you're trying to key in numbers quickly, oh say during an exam. I can't even describe how frustrating it is in the middle of a long string of calculations I realize the stupid decimal point didn't register.If this weren't required for the CFA exam I never would have paid money for this piece of crap. Unless you need it for the same reason (or have muscular fingers I guess) there are calculators both lower and higher end that get you what you want without the ridiculous keys."
1,Breaks down quickly and there's something better,"Three weeks after I receive this calculator, its CF key stops functioning, not to mention that the keys are hard to press to begin with. You can get an iPhone app of this calculator for no more than 10 bucks. I only found out this fact after it went broken. I wouldn't have purchased it if I knew there's the iPhone app."
3,Must stroke slowly,"The key strokes must be done slowly, like old people having coitus, or else it won't register what button you pushed. Other than that, it is capable of performing financial calculations."
2,"Horrible ""feel"" and cheap case","The buttons are horrible...I can't tell you how often I have to retype numbers because the calculator did not capture my input. The buttons have a ""sticky"" feel and are small. Also, the case is a cheap attempt to emulate the strength and durability of the HPs (I hate the 12C...but I think its design and durability has not yet been matched)."
3,Great Product but.....,"This is a great product for business majors. It has many useful features, but the keys is a con on this item. The keys have to be pressed very hard in order to successfully complete the task."
3,Slow to register,"Like others have mentioned, if you tend to type in numbers at even a reasonably fast pace, you will find that it won't register all of your button presses. This can be really frustrating for those of us that have to take exams where time is a critical factor. Going back to fix calculation errors can be a pain."
4,A CFA's Friend,"Great calculator, one of the few allowed to be used on the CFA exams. Bond pricing has never been so easy. Contains a myriad of other functions, also note on this new model calculator the CashFlows work sheet goes to 6yrs. instead of just the 5yrs. that the old one went to. Overall it's a good buy. It is pricey though, if you can find it for $50 or less, buy two."
2,Poor construction,"Bought a couple of these based on 1) positive reviews, 2) it being CFA approved, and 3) my love of the TI89.As far as functionality, the calculator does everything it is supposed to do. It does not have a hard cover, but this i knew beforehand. What I did not expect was the shoddy construction of the keys. The keyboard is brutally bad. If you like typing in numbers without having to double check if in fact the number was key'd in (even if the key clicked), then i would suggest you get another calculator. In fact, just get the non-professional version. Only .09% of financial calculator users need the extra functionality."
4,Pretty good finanical calculator,"I got this calculator for my finance class, and it helps alot. The hardest equations are condensed into pressing a few buttons and out pops the answer. I did find it weird though that it didn't come with a case and instructions on how to use it."
5,BAII Calculator,Calculator works great. I had to buy it for a class. The only thing I don't know how to do is change the decimal places out to more than 2 place.Definitely recommend the product.
2,unimpressed,"I was unimpressed. The coloring is subtle but not outstanding. The violence is gratuitously visible (when it shows something it shows a little more wnated violence than I want). The story wasn't compelling or completely clear, or engrossing for me."
5,Reversing diabetes : This is. superb recipebook I enjoy the meals I have fixed.,I have enjoyed the meal I have prepared out of it.It and reversing diabetes by Julian Whitaker I believe is going to work. So far I have went from a 7 to 5.5. Give me alittle more time and check this again. I want to stay with it a while. But the food is delightful I can't call it a diet book.
5,Long Awaited Sophomore Album Shines!!,"A wonderfully mature follow-up to Vienna's first album, Waking Hour. Her songwriting and music is deeper, richer, and the entire album is a delight to hear.Some songs remind me a lot of Tori Amos, particularly ""Feather Moon"" and ""Passage;"" some remind me of Sarah McLachlan (""Shine""), but most are really Vienna finding her own voice and her own styling.Must listens include ""Harbor,"" a beautiful piece full of longing that describes a long-distance relationship, ""Hope on Fire,"" a surprisingly uptempo song that shows that Vienna can break out of her mold, and ""My Medea,"" which is probably my favorite song on the album. It is a haunting, depressing song, but very powerful and beautiful.This album was well worth the wait, and I strongly encourage everyone to give it a listen! You won't be disappointed."
3,Great small and light camping kettle,"The kettle is great, boils quick. The only drawback was that we have a leak under the nose. other than that it's a must have for anyone who likes outdoor activity."
2,I was hoping for something better,"I was excited to get this muffin tin so I could make a dozen muffins for my boys at a time and for a cheap price, but like they say, you get what you pay for. The tin is nice to start off with, but it rusts all over VERY easily. So now, after I know that, the rust pretty much never comes off all the way and so I am stuck with it. It is still very suitable for use with muffin cups (liners), so oh well."
1,Keep your money....buy the wilton brand....,The information given on this pan is wrong. It will rust. It will rust after the very first use and get worse after each additional use. Please invest in another brand. The wilton brand has not rusted on me.
1,Lousy phone,"I received this phone as a free gift for attending a seminar (the version with the answering machine). At first, I was really excited about this phone because it has a cool look to it. However, the actual operation of the phone is just plain lousy. The volume is very poor, and the placement of the ear piece is awkward. You have to hold the phone up to your ear a certain way in order to adequately hear the speaker on the other end. The ergonomics of the handset also make it uncomfortable to hold. It's like holding a block -- there's nothing that makes this phone ergonomically pleasant. The buttons on the keypad are difficult to push, and I've often had to redial a number because I did not push the buttons down hard enough. Also, while the hand unit does sit on the base properly, it seems to be easily knocked over. I'm not impressed with this phone whatsoever. Its ""coolness"" has worn off on me, so I'm going back to my old Panasonic. Now I know why it was given away as a freebie."
4,Overall Great Phone--Scratches Easy,"Overall this is a very good phone. Range is good, voice quality is very good, speakerphone volume is good, battery life is good (3+ hours on speakerphone). I have been very satisfied with this one. The LCD is small but pretty cool--you can set up color codes for various callers that you can easily see across the room.Downsides are that the finish scratches very easily. The belt clip is a bit fragile. As others mentioned, the phone book management is a bit cumbersome (although this is easy enough to work around).Overall, highly recommend. Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the easily scratched body."
4,"My kids love it, but it's driving us crazy...","The kids love it and will sit quietly and watch. However, after listening/watching it just three times, we were ready to pull out our hair! It's the most annoying video I've ever seen.So...get it for the kids and leave the room when it's on!"
1,Mostly not banjo music,"Of the ten songs on this CD, only 4 actually feature bluegrass banjo music. In addition to those 4, there is one Dixieland, 2 with mostly twangy singing and some banjo backup, and 3 with little or no banjo at all. If you are looking for a good sample of bluegrass banjo, save your money. But if you want a cross section of some bluegrass, some down-home singing and some miscellaneous stuff, you might like this CD. I was very disappointed, however."
2,Robocop could be bigger!!,"When i got this robocop i didn't know it was so small, i just didn't check the size, and be carefull because if he fall down he could loose the arm......."
2,Alice in Wonderland?,The book was like viewing an old silent film of of extremely poor quality. I know that life in general is depressing but mocking life at every turn is even too much for me.
4,lots of good ideas,"This book is fun for kids, and can be a help for mom or dad when you are looking for some activities, I like the way the catagories break out for indoor or outdoor play, ect.."
4,"Review of Y:LM, Volume 3",Another strong volume by Vaughn. There is less inventive atmosphere and more development of character in this volume. There is a notable uprise in puns within this volume--occasionally annoying.
4,"A solid instalment, with some light relief.","The third trade paperback of the Y: The Last Man run of comics, this instalment sees Yorick and co interrupted on their journey by Israeli forces and descending astronauts.The story is strong and self-contained in this edition; there's a nice little two-parter with theatrical themes that appears at the end of the major arc (about returning spacemen) which serves to lighten the mood a little - something necessary, I think, given the general seriousness of the work."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book is nasty. I wanted to read the story of Floyd's criminal exploits. Instead, the author frequently inserts graphic fantasies of Floyd's sex life. I realize the book is a novel, but it comes across as just plain creepy to me and effectively ruins the book. I threw my copy in the trash."
1,Many Better Books Exist,"I had to buy this book for school. At the time I knew how to program a little already, and was quite disappointed by this book. For a programmer, the index is almost more important than the content. The index takes up about 4 pages. Also, this book is very heavy and bulky being packed with 860 or so thick weight pages. There are many better books to learn programming from. This was the worst programming book I've owned, and I've owned more than 50 or so."
1,Very Basic book (Only for The beginner),"This book is extremely basic and extremely disappointing. Covers DAO and RDO but barely touches ADO and OLEDB the defacto standard for Database Access. Doesn't cover many of the main new features of VB6 such as Hierarchical recordsets, Data Environment, Visual database tools, DHTML Applications and more.This book is basically a VB5 BookThis book is very Un-QUE Like..."
5,Horror!,"I love this book til death! It's much better than any action/scary movies I've ever seen. I myself a Vietnamese know little/much about my country. I could imagine all the horrified saying/cursing in my thoughts, I could smell the exact same smell the author did. Everything is moving. I couldn't get my eyes off the books and my hands seemed taped to it. I finished it in 2 days, but I felt like years since Kien Nguyen had written a book so well, sometimes I wondered if I was actually standing beside him in those nightmare years or still under my warm blanket."
1,From the super glowing reviews...,"youd think they came straight from the right hand of God- or are from HP employees-theyre just INK CARTRIDGES-whose real quantity production costs are approx $2,77/per, according to a source- they sell to retailers for a 500% +mark upNo reason to give 5 stars for greed & thievery, BUT as the inventories of unsold printers are growing (ive seen $100 price drops above and beyond the normal below SRP in the last week-like the sellers need to empty the bursting warehouses FAST-maybe the cost of ink cartridges will come down a little and the CEOs and managers will have to settle for a new Jaguar every year instead of a Lamborghini"
4,delightful ink!!!!,"words just can't describe how wondeful this ink cartrige is. It has truly changed my life. Now I can print documents on my printer. Before I bought this print catrige, I could not!!! I highly reccomend it."
1,HP 98 Printer Cartridge DOA,"I guess my bad luck to get a cartridge that was defective, but kudos to the vendor (Tech Supply Center) for processing an immediate refund."
2,Not a leaf tea,"This tea is strong and even tasty, but it has no flavor at all. Well, I never tried Yorkshire tea before, so maybe this tea is as it ought to be. But it was sold as a leaf tea while in fact it is a dust, even with some sawdust inserts!"
3,Inaccurate food information,"This book has wonderful pictures but that's not what counts. I was leafing through it in the bookstore and I found some outdated information. Firstly, the author recommends a mostly seed diet with some veggies, fruits, and pellets. It is now known that seeds are fattening and should be a small part of the cockatiel diet. Pellets are the main food source. He also said that grit should be in a cockatiel's cage to help digestion. Actually, sick cockatiels may eat too much grit and DAMAGE their digestive system. This guy needs to get the facts straight. The information in this book will subtract years from your bird's life if used."
4,awesome Beret :-),"Beret fits well and it's different. Compliments your face, and looks good with large bold round earrings. Beret can be dress up or wear as is. At times when I want to dress up my beret I will place a brooch on the brim, and it looks great. Be creative!!!"
2,?? Not Original..,"Wanna watch a Real Classic? Catch ""Used Cars"".. This film contains what seemingly most film contains of present day.. lackingly un-original and brainless.. Had such high hopes for this.. Was I wrong.. ""Used Cars"" is the ONLY film to watch when comparing.."
2,IT TRIES TO BE FUNNY,This movie tried to be funny and had a fast flow to it but I couldn't engage with it. After 15 minutes I turned it off. Boring and lacking in laughs. OVERALL GRADE: C minus.
5,Great warranty!,The hose to the showerhead got punctured. I sent a short email to the Culligan customer service with the pdf receipt from Amazon and they sent me a replacement hose in a few days for free. It is good to see that their warranty really works!
1,Head heavy,Head heavy no way of adjusting shower head so that the water sprays correctly on you. No I would not recommend this product.
2,Faulty Ball Joint,I installed shower head with no problem. But the ball joint will not support the shower head; it droops completely down even when the shower is on. There is no water leaking so the that actual joint is the problem. Very disappointed as the water that comes out is superb and I need a hand held shower head. Have an email into Culligan and see what it says.
2,bad holder design,"The quality of the shower head is good. However, the shower head holder has a big flaw.With the filter in place, the shower head is too heavy for the ball joint. The shower head keeps pointing down.Does anyone find a solution to fix the ball joint issue?"
4,Good product Good performance,The Culligan HSH-C135 is very easy to install and functions as advertised. I can tell a difference after using for a month. Showers no longer dry out my skin and hopefully eliminates any chlorine vapor inhalation.
4,Fix Heavy Shower Head,"This is a fix for the heavy shower head holder for some,,,others may not like it. Push the shower head all the way up and look at the swivel attachment where the pipe comes out of the wall. Take a small plastic tie wrap and pull it around the connection with the buckel at the bottom and let the head rest on it...tighted the tie wrap and trim to the buckel. You won't be able to see the tie wrap without leaning around to the back of the pipe. Now the angle of the shower head is no longer straight down but at fixed level resting on the tie wrap. Hope this helps someone."
1,not good,"The shower head is so heavy that it won't stay up when showering. I contacted culligan and they had no remedies. When I said I guess I'll have to return it, he said that sounds like the best thing. They really need to fix this, big design flaw!!!!"
5,Solid...Just solid,This is a great book to add to your study material. The book has a briefing section in the beginning followed by multiple choice questions and more importantly PASSAGES. This book even shows how to cut corns so you do not waste needed time. Strongly recommended if you are like me and need additional aid in the physical science area of your studies.
4,SCORE AVAILABLE ON DVD,"Timothy Brock's newly commissioned score for Murnau's ""SUNRISE"" can be heard with the film on the Fox DVD that includes this new score as well as the original 1927 Hugo Riesenfeld score that was part of the film upon its original release in 1927. The CD contains only a portion of his score for the film which runs 95 minutes. The ""SUNRISE"" DVD has been available as part of a set and will soon be available as part of the ""MURNAU, BORZAGE & FOX"" set to be released in early December 2008. Murnau's ""SUNRISE"" and ""CITY GIRL"" are included along with Frank Borzage's great romantic silent features, ""7TH HEAVEN"" (for which he won the first Best Director Oscar), ""STREET ANGEL"" and ""LUCKY STAR"". Also included are early sound features directed by Borzage. Brock's score is worth hearing with the film, but don't pass up the original score!"
2,This box is NOT official - that's why it sucks!,"First: The album ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" is one of the best albums of the year 2000. But, even if you are a huge U2 fan, don't buy this box!Off course, it is nicely made. Velvet cover with the golden heart in a suitcase. In the box are the official album CD, then there's a hat with the print ""U2 2000"", a zippo lighter with ""U2 2000"" and three guitar licks with U2 logo. But nothing is written in the official U2 font (the one from the album). This is why I know for 100% that this box is NOT official. So don't get fooled and spend so much money for something unofficial. Nothing to be proud of as a true fan."
3,50% Great,Enjoyed first few songs and then I found it impossible to listen to the rest. Very Disappointed.
3,Adiddas Quality??,"I dont know if it is an Addidas issue, but after the second wash, the numbers in this jersey started to fade. They got Ugly fast. It never happened with my reebok or Nike jerseys. Very dissapointed!"
1,Does not fit 2000 Subaru Outback,"Amazon's tool said this would fit our 2000 subaru outback and it does not! Very similar but the plug is clearly built to accept a slightly different bulb assembly. While the bulb itself is about the same, this bulb assembly has one ridge inside while the original has a groove in the same place. So, you can slide this one into the plug. Complete opposite!"
5,Fantastic Puppet!!,"This hand puppet is a wonderful gift. My grandson loved having the raccoon ""pop-out"" at people. This would make a great gift to a child in the hospital. They could really enjoy ""getting back"" at a few of the medical staff!!"
3,Nice flashlight with a serious flaw,"I purchased this flashlight a few years back and was pretty happy with its performance. Sure, the different bulbs have different levels of brightness. This flashlight isn't the brightest at long ranges, but for shorter distances it works pretty well and is quite nice-with a broad spectrum of light lighting up a given area.But, I have to warn you, that the reason this flashlight is getting three stars is because it does not shut off! For example, to turn the flashlight on and to turn on the different bulbs, you have to click it a few times. You also have to click it a few times to shut it off-if it shuts off. So, the serious flaw is that this flashlight does not shut off as it should! Sometimes it even turns itself on! Not shutting off and turning itself on runs down battery life! So be careful. The easy solution to this problem is to unscrew the entrance to the battery compartment when you're done using it."
1,Dangerous Training Method (book),"This book, while it does have very few good ideas, is the best example of how NOT to train a dog!! On one page it actually says that if your fingers are bleeding from a dog taking treats from your hand, put the treats in your fist and let the dog 'gnaw' at our hand, only letting the dog have a treat when it bite softens! Ya right folks!!! I do great dane rescue and do you realize how many hands I'd go through if I tried that method!!! I'd have bloody stumps! And the book gets much worse. Call around your area, find a trainer in person you can visit with. Using the above method is going to get many people injured!!"
5,MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"Michael Ball does it again! He wows audiences with his powerful voice. The songs he chose for this concert are awesome. My heart will go on just blows Celine's version out of the water! The Rose will bring tears to your eyes and Love changes everything will change your heart. Truly Michael has outdone himself on this Cd. He shows us all a different side of himself. The pop side, the blues side, the broadway side. Amazing!"
2,Not sharp...I thought these were knives?,"I was very dissappointed in these. They were not sharp at all! I guess I should not assume something labeled ""knives"" will be sharp. Also, they were very light and cheap feeling."
1,Misleading ad and DOA!,"I ordered this because I live in an area with extremely high water pressure (in Costa Rica). For years, I have used Nelson/Gilmour brass connectors, so literally all my hoses, sprinklers and nozzles have these adapters. They won't work with this fine piece of junk. So, if I am to use it, I will have to unscrew my brass adapters and put on this plastic adapter. Ok, I did that. Turned on the water and it squirts out of the pressure control knob on the back of the pistol. It ain't exactly easy to return something from where I live, so I hope it is heavy enough to be an anchor.I do NOT recommend this product."
1,Hard to adjust,I found this nozzle hard to adjust as I am apparently accustomed to using the Nelson to the spray style I want which adjusts with a quick turn.
5,Fantastic!!! The best books on the ESL market!,"I teach and live in Japan. I've used every one of the Kinney Brothers books in my classes and the students loved them. My fellow teachers used them as well, with great results. The stories are very diverse and interesting for the students. Kinney Brothers Publishing has produced far more interesting, entertaining ESL material than any other textbook for ESL learners that is currently on the market. I look forward to what they have in store for us next...........Sincerely, Ivan Mcabe"
4,an overall good comp,"i've been a fan of the club's releases since cream live 2, and this comp mostly lives up to the name, and that's good. most of the tracks selected are great...the only thing i didn't like--in every 8 tracks or so, one is thrown in that makes me go ""huh?--who put this bubblegum [music] in here?"" (it's wierd to hear a poorly-done house tune on a trance comp, even if it is cream)."
4,yamaha speakers,Very good for the price. Sound is decent. made well although the side adjustments for tilting were groved on the part but not on the speaker bracket. all in all they went up easy and enjoy the sound in the back yard.
1,"The worst outdoor speaker for its size, ever.","These are the worst speakers I have ever heard, and are unable to be driven by any amp under 100 watts sufficiently. Even with powered alright, they lack the bass and clarity of most outdoor speakers, or even a 10 year old Sony boom box. Had to send them back, there also MASSIVE in size, and don't produce what they look like they should. Dont always trust the reviews."
4,I would prefer more bass sound...,"Nice sound. Clear on the mid and high frequencies, but I would prefer more ability on the lower side of the range. Maybe this is just a personal preference.Very good product and value for the price."
4,Great overall very happy,Was looking for a quality speaker for the back of my house to use for the pool and after reading reviews and knowing the usual quality of Yamaha speakers decided to purchase these. Great decision. Great sound with nice clear highs and adequate bass..for those looking for deep bass buy a subwoofer . Constructed very well and very easy to install.
1,Incomplete,"I was under the impression that this would include some step-by-step instructions on how to setup Servlets, JSPs, EJBs, etc... It does, however, they aren't complete. I've had to fill in the blanks in quite a few areas in the Chapter 7 example and I still can't get it to work. There are too many holes in this book if you are looking for some step-by-step instruction."
2,Principal's New Clothes,"The Principal's New Clothes is a story I would not recommend. I purchased it with the idea of comparing and contrasting with the classic The Emperor's New Clothes. I was unable to do that because the story was so different. I would not buy this again because it did not meet my ideas and plans. However, the story on its own is cute."
4,A cute adaptation of The Emperor's New Clothes,"A cute adaptation to The Emperor's New Clothes, this modern-day story has all the makings of the original version, but with a few changes. Children will enjoy this story as they envision a person who is both smart and well respected being fooled into believing a lie. A fabulous book for classroom reading, this picture book will help children see the value in telling and discerning the truth.I may actually like this version better than the original. Primarily, because children are far more capable of relating to a principle, than to an Emporor. Also, I see all too often, people in positions of authority being made a mockery of in children's literature and on television and in movies. That, however, is not the case with this book. - It is truly an entertaining book with an underlying message that is worth telling to children.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
3,"Great product, but...","It's hard to find a more satisfying peanut buttery treat than this favorite treat from my childhood. May they never stop making them! But while the cookie itself rates a five-star plus, I was sent an entire case of packages whose sell-by date expired several weeks before they were shipped. One-Star-Minus for the warehouse shippers! That said, the response to my complaint was not only a complete and unequivocal refund, but zipped back to me only minutes after my grumpy email. Five stars to Customer Care Department. So it should average a 3+ but no fractional stars are permitted."
4,My wife and kids love em !,"Figured I would surprise them with a case. Well, they went fast ! Came in undamaged unlike others have experienced, but the expiration date was nearing quickly. Had my family not loved them so much, they may have been tossed out rather than consumed."
4,easy to use,easy to use only thing that would make the kit better is to include something to spread the oil so it coats evenly.
4,A crisis of what was then and what is now. Great story.,"I picked up this book on a cold, rainy evening in Brooklyn, NY. I remember reading Jim Defilippi's ""Blood Sugar"" many years ago and thought I'd see what ""Duck Alley"" had in store for me. This book was read during my AM and PM commutes on the NYC subway; a perfect place for the characters of Jay Tasti and Albert Niklozak to work their story into my daily grind. I liked how the flashbacks (which take place in Duck Alley, Long Island, in the 1950's) juxtaposed youthful ideals and boyhood shenanigans with a current adult crises. These flashbacks allowed me to develop separate ideas about the young Tasti and Albert vs. the adult ones and it made the current day story more complicated. At the heart of most stories, is a crisis. The crisis in ""Duck Alley"" is awkward, muddy, and ultimately, surprising. I always love a good surprise. This book delivered!"
1,I could not get past the first few pages it was so bad,"Sorry mate, this book is not worth reading. Look at it in your local college first before buying if you dont take my word for it."
4,Heavy Duty Cover,Someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag. It is not. It is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time.
4,decent smoker cover,This cover is medium-weight and fits the Meco bullitt-style smoker well. A decent cover for the price.
3,Buying a 2nd one,"Bought one of these 4.5 years ago. It is shredded on the bottom at this point. It is not a great cover and if you can afford a better one, don't buy this. It isn't thick enough and you have to be careful not to rip it when removing it. I am only buying a second one because I know it will fit my grill and because even the more expensive ones don't seem to have great reviews. So for $10, it is adequate. Just barely."
2,Cheap plastic ripped,"Don't waste your money (even just 10 bucks). The plastic is not rip-stop and tears very easily. I will now just use a big, heavy duty, black trash can liner - they are much stronger!"
1,make up of cover,"I think we should have been told that the make up of the cover could be dangerous. It stated: ""Wash hands after handling the cover because the could be known cancerous results"" I would not have bought the cover."
4,Great keyboard,We love this keyboard especially for the price but the stand is horrible. Isn't secure or stable no matter how we tighten it.
3,Rollator,"Good bargain for the price. Especially with the FREE SHIPPING. Suggestions for improvement of product: The release of the lock on brake was too sudden and forceful. If your finger was in the way, it could get hit painfully hard. I would soften the release so no risk of damage to fingers. If this was corrected rating would be higher."
5,"A Hint of Heather, 1716 Scottish Highlands","Neil Claremont, Earl of Derrowford, is a man with a mission. All he wants to do is complete construction of the first of King George's Scottish fortresses and return to his comfortable life in London. But the Ancient Gentlemen of Clan MacInnes have bigger plans for him and Neil Claremont soon finds himself abducted and married to the laird of Clan MacInnes -- Lady Jessalyn MacInnes.As he and Jessalyn begin a marriage neither of them wanted, Neil learns that there is more to life than building cathedrals and palaces. With Jessalyn, he has an opportunity to build a family, a home and a lasting peace with England, so he sets out to win her heart.Jessalyn learns that there are greater enemies to fight than a handsome English husband bearing gifts and that Neil Claremont is a man willing to share her burden as Laird without usurping her position as leader of her clan. She learns to open her heart to him and to believe that he will never betray her trust."
2,I am soooo disappointed!,"I have used this little blender for years. Literally every day. Loved it so much that when my second machine gave in (now, I do have 4 kids and make smoothies every day), I knew had to buy another. What a huge disappointment this time. The machine now is so noisy I cannot stand to use it! I will be returning it and trying a magic bullet. So sad that good things cannot last."
4,Raw Power,"This group shares a lot with The Libertines : a tendency for badly produced songs and bragging about how great they are; as to Razorlight, I must confess, this holds true enough. This is rock at its rawest, and even so, they find the genius to pen a song as beautiful as ""Golden Touch"". The punch of ""Rip it up"" is also amazing, makes you wanna jump like crazy. ""Stumble and Fall"" is another favourite of mine, but the whole CD is worth it. It was a real good surprise this turned out to be far better than the highly-praised Libertines second outing. Maybe the critics are looking at the wrong direction"
4,In the right mood...,"This is a very good album, different sound an very expresive lyrics... All the album your heart will be up beated..."
5,"Based on a look at a draft copy, I can't wait for this book!","I had a chance to review a draft copy of this book for Barry. It is the clearest description of fastpitch softball pitching mechanics I've ever seen. The chapters on Psychology and the Mental Game are worth the price of the book by themselves! Could use some photos instead of all line drawings, but I guess that would greatly raise the price.Larry Warrenfeltz"
3,Fastpitch Softball: The Windmill Pitcher,"Illustrations are not clear enough for a beginner to understand. I pitched fastpitch for over 35 years and I had trouble understanding what was being taught.Overall, I was not too impressed with the book. I probably won't use it as a reference for my pitching school."
5,"Site unseen, but I know the author as a student","As a former student of Professor Detemple and a former professor, he is simply one of the best organized, most articulate, and without hesitation, one of the truly talented teachers and authors I have ever met.I just bought the book, and eagerily await its delivery. If his book is as wonderful as he is, I expect a truly outstanding book."
3,dull style but useful reference,"I wouldn't read this to my child of any age as it is written in a plodding and colourless style, but I do find it a useful reference for reminding myself of stories and names that I can weave into the conversations I have with my little boy. what's a labyrinth? What's an echo?This is a good, comprehensive selection of tales that have been simplified to the point they have lost their mystery and magic."
4,NOT a beginner's book,"WIN 32 PERL is not a book for beginners. You are probably a systems administrator looking for solutions to you time-consuming administration tasks. If so, look this book over.The book is written in a small font making it a book you need to read when your mind is fresh. It does contain detailed coding information for the various system problems. WIN 32 PERL contains nine chapters explaining things from Monitoring and Reporting and Logon Scripts to ADSI and WMI.The content page is only three-and-a-half-pages long but the index of fifteen pages more than makes up for the lack in the content section. Finally, there is a 20-page review of other books available to assist you in your administrative needs."
2,Solid Product but pricy,"A very well made product and great for the minimalist type of folks.Wife like the looks of the leather but I view this tote did not provide me the return on investment when compared to alternatives. an item that is greater than $100 should have served me more than an open tote that does not prevent the tool from falling out. it has NO internal pockets nor outside pockets for smaller items that I would like to access quickly.This is designed for people (like my wife) who enjoys the looks more than its functionality it provides.alternatively, there are MANY more economically and functional options if you want to use this as a working tote."
2,Cute but...,"It's a cute toy, but NOT worth the money. It takes some practice to work it. It's not really a toy for the Dads to use, their hands probably wouldn't fit (my husband's doesn't and he is average size)."
1,Where is it?,"I ordered this wagon for my granddughter's birthday, it showed up disguised as a skateboard ramp! She's only 1 year old, nice going aahhhggg."
4,Cute & Sturdy but a bit small,"I got two of these for bedside tables. They're cute and pretty sturdy- they come with the top piece (table top, drawer, etc) and four legs you have to screw in. The tables are pretty short - maybe only 18""? but a value none the less. The top of the table has some flower engravings: a big flower in the center and several around the edge. I think these will be pretty subtle after I paint the whole thing a darker color. Overall I would recomend...And the shipping was super quick!"
4,Global Past,"What can I say? not a super exciting read, but does a pretty good job teaching you what you need to know."
3,It could have been so much better...,"While the pictures do look awesome, don't be mislead as to the quality of this kit. First off the wings are simply not designed well. They are too heavy to stay in any position except flopping down. Plus some of the pieces are not designed well and simply fall off, such as the smaller shoulder parts. It is in desperate need of a display stand because it can't stand up unless you use the wings for support. You could make it look amazing if you are willing to sink a lot of time into it if you are a good modeler and want to modify it. Otherwise, don't bother getting it. I would suggest the Master Grade version of this which is what this kit should have been."
1,Received damaged product,"I received this product and every individual piece was broken into dozens of little pieces. It was not the packaging (box was not crushed at all), and Amazon's packing was fine. I think Heath sells this as seconds. They really should let people know before they sells them that these are seconds."
2,Dont pay for this one,"Cresent City has many amusing and intricate little plots, a couple cute ideas, and a bit of politics. That is it folks! The show is over! Half the plots are never resolved and it's not written well enough for me to forgive Goonan for that. Electronic equipment can be protected from electromagnetic impulses, and the entire premise of nanites being automaticaly immune to the impulse is absurd. The idea of pheremone comunication is about the only thing in the book that is plausible. Read some Neal Stephenson or find a ""Transmetropolitan"" graphic novel. If you feel the need to read Cresent City Rhapsody go to the library."
3,Too Long!,"After the first couple of pages I already liked one of the primary characters, Marie, and I was hooked. This novel really illustrates, as I believe, that it is science and technology, nanotechnology here in this novel, that determines our future, and not what politicians allow or disallow, the technology just moves underground or overseas if necessary, and the politicians are left to their window dressing, science determining ultimately how we live.However, as I read more of this book I found myself in a tedious, long drawn out affair, with so many characters it was hard to keep track of them all. Because of this I felt a diversion of interest, just too much to keep track of. I did like the philosophy that permeates this novel as a whole, very refreshing indeed. This novel occurs in the same universe as two of Goonan's previous novels, QUEEN CITY JAZZ, and MISSISSIPPI BLUES, and this novel explains much of the background of those two novels."
2,Disappointed,"I began canning this summer and was charmed by how attractive these jars looked online. Unfortunately, they require a more laborious process for water canning than the 3-part type of lids I am accustomed to using. Also, even after trying to process these jars twice, only about 1/3 of my jars sealed adequately. The item I was canning was meant to be Christmas gifts, which was why I was okay with the added expense for these jars. I will not buy these again and will only be using the ones I have already purchased as little flower vases or storage jars for spices or something. For the extra price and effort, these were very disappointing. Ball and Kerr jars have my business back completely."
2,Not so great,"My mom ordered this for me, because I liked medieval stuff. When I first used this puppet, I was dissapointed, because it was too small for my whole hand, and her head kept falling off. My mom tried ordering another one, but that puppet did the same.We didn't even get our money back!"
1,sucks,"Was a good product intel I decided to turn it side ways so it wouldn't be long ways hanging down frm my belt, and every time you bump something it falls off if you sit down the clip falls off I guess fell off one to many so ir broke the second day I had it"
2,belt clip breaks easily,pro phone case fits well . con belt clip holster breaks upon first use . they are made to work together so breakage renders all useless. have to find another
3,Not bad for the price,"The belt clip will come apart from the actual shell if medium pressure is applied, partially due to the size of the phone and where you wear it on your waist. Also the case does not have a viewing stand as advertised, but I am keeping the case anyway. It will work for now."
1,not strong enough,case not strong enough to hold the galaxy note. Keep slip out and even crack the glass now I have to replace it. I cannot give a good rating only one star.
5,Very nice!,"This case probably doesn't have the greatest protection, but it doesn't add a lot of bulk either. It gives you a good grip and the case will give the screen some protection as well. I agree that it would be nice to be able to face the screen the other way, but that's not how it's designed."
2,not what I was expecting,This case doesnt work face out.... you cant slide it into the holder with the back cover on. 20 dlls to the garbage
2,Just doesn't have the goods,It looks nice but doesn't deliver. The case is slim profile but only offers middling protection. The belt clip popped off the case back twice in the first 2 days. This means a 2 ft. fall for the phone. Fortunately both times I was in my living room and the phone fell on the couch. I will not trust my $600 phone to a less than top case and holster. I got an Otterbox Defender case and a custom leather pouch w/ belt LOOPS from fortte.com. Check them out. They will make a leather pouch customized for your phoe w/ case on. Don't trust your expensive Note 2 to a $13 case. Get an Otterbox and protect your invesrment.
2,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster,As many others have said the holster clip is a POS. It broke on mine the very first time I sat down in the car. Even when I was sitting in a desk chair I could hear it making noises every time I moved. This it turned out was the cheap plastic cracking a little bit with each movement. I was able to use the holster for a whopping 15 minutes before the belt clip broke. Gave it 2 stars because the case is of some use by itself.
4,great price and value,I bought this back in December shortly After the release of the GN2 for Sprint. I love. My phone and certainly want to protect the investment. I wear it every day (salesperson) & been using it over a month and am waiting for an otter box to come out soon. Only gave 4 stars since it would be nice to have a way to hsve a kickstand when out of the holster.
2,"Cheap, very cheap belt clip","This belt holster lasted 2 days before a side swipe took off the belt clip. If is cheap and not able to withstand normal daily bumps and wear. My first one lasted about 3 weeks before breaking. Both break where the clip attaches to the holster. The plastic is very light and not durable.On the positive I like the phone case and the feel and fit of it. I now use on my Note 2 and Galaxy SII. However, I have splurged and purchased the Seidio belt clip. It 3x cost but holds up to daily use much better. Fortunately the case works with the Seidio holster. The Seidio does not offer the texture and easier to drop.So, if you want a nice phone case and not concerned about belt clip then buy it. Or mix and match as I choose to do."
1,"Poor Quality, Terrible Service: Lost my returns","I ordered this product in December of 2012, right after buying my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and it looked like a nice basic case. I found that it does provide good protection for the phone; but the quality of the case isn't so good.After just a week or so, the rubberized plastic started chipping off around the corners near the screen. I contacted them and they offered to replace it, so I placed another order and sent the original back.The new one I received seemed alright; but only a couple of days after ordering the clip came off and would not stay on very well. I don't know anyone in their right mind who would want to clip an expensive phone onto them, with a clip that slips off easily. That's a good way to lose your phone.I just mailed the second case back at my own expense. I don't know why I should have to pay shipping; but I guess that's the policy. Hopefully I get credit for both purchases soon."
2,barely passable,"It was not a complete loss, but it is slow moving, boring and some parts are annoyingly unbelievable."
3,Flat and confusing,"I have to agree, the main character, John March, is a pain. He's soooo hurt. He can't get on with his life. And he's angry, punching people out for no better reason than that they are low-lifes.The author describes everything in incredible detail, until I was bored to death. ""There were three windows in the dining room."" Who cares? And he always uses ""is,"" ""was,"" and were. Nothing interesting.Worst of all, there isn't a single laugh in the whole book.Skip it."
1,Great Book for a Cryptographer,This book was required for my stats class and it was terrible. The organization was terrible. This book also requires you to get software to use for some problems but doesn't come with any software. When the example finishs by saying use your computer software to solve that doesn't help much. The examples are all scrambled around and the problems have little to do with the examples provided. I had a grad student who couldn't understand the questions because of poor english skills and I couldn't learn a thing from this book. Overall a bad stats experience
3,Hehehe,Honest to God I picked the book by mistake but could not stop listening to it. It teaches you some great lessons about men and how they are aroused. More... I cannot say just read it if you like.
5,Excellent!,"Very inexpensive! They are very easy to set up and come with several mounting choices. I am using the Yamaha speakers as indoor/remote speakers to get audio in kitchen from central receiver/iPod dock/CD/DVD hub, the sound is amazing."
5,Great speakers,"These speakers are great. We just enlarged our screened in porch and mounted the two speakers on the two corners of the porch. Mounting them was a breeze (according to my husband) and the sound is fantastic. For the price, you can't beat these speakers. We also installed an on/off/volume switch on the wall and can now listen to the house stereo and TV as low or as loud as we like."
4,Great sound for poolside,"Bought these 2 years ago and they are still holding up well. I mounted them under my eaves so they are out of the weather, but they get plenty of temperature changes being in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I am running them through a cheap receiver and the sound is very good for the price. I can't crank them too loud because I don't want to disturb my neighbors, but they are plenty powerful for the backyard. Highly recommend."
5,Great Bargain,"These speakers were used as outdoor speakers at the beach, so i'm not expecting them to last long, but they sound decent and i won't cringe if i have to replace them every year."
2,"Not good enough, they were returned",I was very disappointed with the AW150's and have now returned them. They simply don't produce enough volume or bass that is adequate for outdoor listening. These speakers were to go outside along the wall by our pool but as soon as we turned them up loud enough to hear them as background music they got extremely fuzzy and just sounded terrible. if the volume is turned down they are ok. but nothing more. just ok. i was optimistic after reading other reviews but these AW150s just didn't' live up to the hype. I got the polk Atrium 5 as replacements and am very satisfied with them.
4,Great for the price,"Purchased these speakers for 70 bucks didnt expect alot, they are well made light easy to handle and install. used them for about 2 weeks, fill an average yard with a clear sound; perfect for an inexpensive backyard solution."
4,Good Speakers & Great Price,I've just installed the speakers on my deck outside and so far so good. The install wasn't very difficult my only complaint is that the mounting brackets should come with the appropriate screws. Otherwise The speakers are good for outside and since I got such a great price on them I don't have to worry about them getting damaged or stolen.
5,Great Speakers for the money,"These are great speakers! Well worth the price. Great sound. Hung them at our pool area, bought a $3 receiver from thrift shop and play pandora through them. No regrets."
3,No bottom end,"After reading several ""glowing"" reviews of these speakers, I bought 2 pair to replace some that had seen better days. From the moment i turned them on, I was highly disappointed. These speakers have very bad low req. response. Just another tinny $20 plastic box from china. Do not buy these thihnkingyouwill enjoy a robust full range speaker, these ain't it!"
2,Not of good quality,I did not expect that these would turn out to be so very bad. The sound quality was of average and during the last winter the speakers stopped working all of a sudden. They broke and are completely unusable now.
4,Good sound at a very reasonable price.,"These speakers are out on our deck, and so far they have worked well. You will need to purchase a receiver as well to use them."
4,great buy,Great speakers for the price. They look nice and sound great. I put them outside at the pool and they work and sound great.
2,"Prettily written, badly structured","Golding has a way with words; there is no denying it. At his best, he can really deliver a hard blow to the mind.He is not at his best here.There are some lovely snips--Cry! Cry! What shall I cry?--but they are buried in a story that manages to be both pretentious and pedestrian. The novelist, who may-or-may-not be Golding-esque (I don't know the man and am not reading to guess whether or not this is autobiographical), is a stereotype of a drunken writer dithering around Europe and having a nervous breakdown. There's nothing either sympathetic or interesting about him. His surrounding circle is equally vacuous, and the plot, regarding a biographer chasing him around to get a story is... well, dreary. It's not a complex story and I understand the things Golding means to say, but all in all, he does not say them very well.A pity--the words really are quite nice."
5,Great book to help you buy a practice,"I would definately recommend this book if you are interested in either buying or selling an accounting or tax practice. Being business advisors ourselves, we feel we already know a lot about buying and selling businesses - which we do. However it is a wise investment of your time and money to read this book to discover the nuances associated specifically with a CPA practice. After reading this book and attending an online webinar put on by Pro Horizons - I retained one of their consultants - Chuck Hayes - to assist me in evaluating different practices for sale. Chuck has been great in helping me decide on a practice and we are in the latter stages of acquiring a practice.Stanley Dean, CPAStanley Dean & Associates, P.C.Atlanta, GA[...]"
4,Yr 2000 Book On One Of America's Hottest Collectibles !!,"A brand new book containing more than 600 large, sharp, black and white photos and a gorgeous 16 page full color section. There's plenty of background information provided, in addition to the current pricing. Topics range from A & P, Adams Gum, Anheuser-Busch, to International Harvester, John Deere, Ken-L, to Z.B.T., and Zeno Gum. This is a good general reference work for the advertising collector, covering more than 5,000 listings. A very complete index, makes item location easy. The advertising collector will refer to this up-do-date volume often."
1,Nicely packaged con...,"I've had this lantern for two years and it performed well the few times we actually got to take it out. Then the bulb burnt out. There is no where in the metropolitan area of a bustling state capital that I can find a replacement bulb for this lantern because it is so specialized. You can order it online for $12.90. I got my lantern on sale for $25. Coleman has the same sweet deal going as projectors. It's not the initial cost of the hardware, it's the huge investment in disposable bulbs."
4,Decient for the Camp Grounds,"This lantern is far more than advertised. The reason I am giving it less than 5 stars are as follows:1. Bright and Dim light settings are about the same.2. Night light is worthless.3. Power loss circuit does not apply to night light.On the good side (why I gave it 4 stars)1. The battery life is amazing. About 7 hours on High. Far more than expected or advertised.2. Rugged. Should that a few drops and not hurt anything.3. Has enought room in the base for the cords.4. Lights up a camp area very well.About everything you would expect from a lantern and it is battery powered so no heat, no flame, no gasses."
3,delayed delivery!,Product took a long time to arrive but it is good looking and serves its purpose. I've had only one power outage and it came in handy to keep my room well lit !
4,more info uncovered,"i was happy to put the author in touch with star peggy cummins, etc and i think he has produced a very entertaining book about an excellent film.as the official historian for elstree film studios, where it was made in 1956, i have met many of those involved behind and in front of the camera on 'night of the demon' over the past 35 years. i even screened the film at the studio in 1987 in the viewing theatre where the rushes were originally screened, to a teenage audience who loved it. sadly many of the actors and crew are no longer with us but tony's book reminded me to dig out notes on various conversations i had with them over the years and some studio files..all of which never before published. i think they may 'put to rest' the questions about the monster sequences, etc. i hope to put in into arcticle form for the excellent american mag 'the little shoppe of horrors' later this year."
5,The best bath towel,"I am so glad I can get these bath towels from Amazon! I used to have to stock up and buy a whole bunch of them when visiting family in Hawaii, or beg them to send me some in the mail. The rest of the mainland hasn't caught on yet (at least not mainstream stores - unless one is lucky enough to live near an Asian supermarket/store). Thanks for making these available - I can buy them anytime now!"
5,I can't shower without this.,"I've been using this for the last 20 years, someone from Hawaii introduced it to me. It's much more coarse than ""poofs"" that other people bathe with. I prefer it more coarse so that it is actually exfoliating me. I find it easier to use and handle than the poofs (also easy to scrub your back). I don't know how to shower with out it. If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don't feel as clean. It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel. I usually keep mine for a couple years, I put in in the laundry and air dry it to clean it every so often. The old ones I recycle as my travel wash cloth.I used to find it at a shop on Grant Ave in SF Chinatown, and an Asian mart in Bergenfield, New Jersey. I'm glad I've found it on Amazon!You do have to watch out for knockoffs, they are not as coarse (unless you prefer softer ones). Whole Foods also has a version which is a little longer, and softer."
5,Why wasn't I advised of these earlier?,"WOW! Didn't think i'd be so impressed by a washrag, lol. I ordered mine from Pandora and received the salux version, not a knock-off brand. It's phenominal! Especially for the feet, back, and hands, never felt cleaner. The only reason i'd even heard of them is from reading reviews on how these were recommended for black soap, as the rag doesn't stain like regular wash cloths. It's really long, so I will be cutting mine in half and giving the other half to my husband. I have a very small stand up shower and had no problem with it staying soapy. I used ALOT less soap than usual. I will be purchasing more in the future!"
3,Not an actual Salux,"I checked the reviews after purchasing the item because I've used an actual Salux before. It says Salux, so that is what I expected. Unfortunately, another posted mentioned that these are not actual Salux cloths and I was stuck with this. It works okay, but is not what I expected and may not offer some of the benefits of a true Salux cloth."
3,Follow product instructions- do not use under direct water!,"This bath towel does get a decent amount of lather and exfoliates as much as a standard synthetic loofah. i also like the elegantly simple solution it provides to reaching all areas of the body. however, with this towel you really do have to be completely out of the line of running water while using it, otherwise it will lose its lather fast and require re-soaping. i have a small shower space, so this means i have to turn off the shower completely while using the towel so i don't have to waste more soap. This might get annoying come winter time."
5,A Must have,"If you like the first vallenato CDs from Carlos Vives, multiply them by 10 and you have ""El Ciclon."" This is the type of cd you will listen to over and over ++++ again. From slow songs to fast paced, rythm full songs, this group combines cumbia, vallenato, merengue, salsa with a modern dance beat in their self titled CD, which deserves to be called ""CICLON"""
4,Reviews by Redmon,"In All on a Mardi Gras Day, Reid Mitchell writes an outstanding book that approaches Mardi Gras from both a historical and cultural perspective. Mitchell's attention to historical details, his courage to make certain claims---and then supporting them by citing references---and his devotion to posing and answering questions using concise and clear paragraphs makes this book a joy to read and accessible to almost anyone!"
2,Auburn Tigers 2010 Perfect Season,This is the third time I have complained about what was sent. The picture show the championshio game DVD in its own case for protection or resale -$17.95 value. What was sent was the DVD only shrinkwrapped to the box set.Why hasn't anyone from Amazon contacted me - again the 3rd time I have comlained.
4,Best Shirley Temple movie of all,"Actually, I watched this movie because I was so fascinated by Dorothy Dell, who starred as ""Bangles Carson,"" a tough gambler's girlfriend and nightclub singer. It is hard to believe that Dell was only nineteen years old when she made this film; she died two weeks after the film's release in a horrific nighttime car accident. But she looks and acts much, much older...she was beautiful, talented, and had an extremely promising future.Oh, yes...and Shirley Temple? Well, I think this was the best role she ever did. She was so little (five years old) and so gifted and natural in this role...her later movies were too sugary for my taste! She and Dell and Adoph Menjou had marvelous chemistry together in this film, although Menjou was terrified of Temple's screen presence and knew she was stealing the film.Well worth seeing!"
3,can these canning jars really work?,"i was very pleased with the delivery and price-speed and durability of the product arriving was goodhowever, i didn't realize from the product picture that these jars are not smooth on the inside. the pretty pattern that it has on the outside penetrates to the inside of the bottle-it seems as though the print was molded from inside out. this is of concern to me because it won't be able to clean properly and dirt can get trapped in the groves on the inside if you don't carefully wash iti would have loved these, the size and sturdyness is perfect, but i can't deal with unnecessary headaches and cleaning them would have been a bother on a daily basis"
5,Acupressure for Lovers: Secrets of Touch for Increasing Intimacy,Very detail and ilustrative book. Good to people that want change and found new secrets to keep on the love and known specific point to turn on your lover.
3,pleased,I think this is a darling ring. The color of the stone is pale but overall it is very attractive.
5,I almost peed my pants,"This book was hilarious, as all Hank books are! The best part is the sleep talking scene--""foggy doggy mumbo jumbo"". This book was also incredibly dumb but so funny I almost peed my pants. Read this book if you want something light and funny."
1,GPX equals garbage,"This product is hard to set up, the instructions are graphical, and very vague. The TV doesn't work on all channels, even on a cable hookup. There is a squeal when the TV is on that never goes away. The mounting is very poorly engineered, with the cable hookup on the back, it makes the unit stick out forward of the cabinet. Overall it is a very poor product, and will be the last GPX product I will buy."
1,piece of junk,"My wife always dreamed of having a little TV in her kitchen. So I bought this as a birthday present for her. We tried for weeks to get this piece of junk to work. Finally, she got so angry at it, that she pulled it off the cabinet and smacked me with it. This piece of junk almost ruined my marriage. I will never forgive GPX."
2,"Decent, but...","This is a decent unit, if you have analog cable or a separate dtv converter on the antenna. My only issue is that the button design is cheap and the power button broke-off within the first year. I replaced the power button with another switch and mounted it on the side and the unit has been working ok for 2 more years, but this is beyond most people's expertise for a repair."
1,Something needs to be done.,"This is my favorite Animated series in a long time, but the '3 Random Episode' DVD format is appauling. I would happily spend good money on seasonal box sets, and have on shows that I like less (Batman AS, GI Joe, Transformers). Between Justice League and X men Evolution it is a shame that this can't be accomplished. Obviously there's a reason for it, it just doesn't seem like it's a good one.Oh well maybe we can look forward to a compilation in 5 or 6 years, but it's too bad. I thought the entertainment industry liked money, and by snubbing adult collectors they're missing out on a fortune."
1,Why Bother ?,Wait for the releases of each full season so they stop this non-sense of random episodes !!
1,"Great series, not worth being gouged on the DVD","I am constantly amazed at the depth of the stories, why can't the bundle them up by the season?To update - They Have! Hooray!"
2,Disappointed,"Well, even though DLink offers the 650W/K (650W w/CF-to-PCMCIA) on their website you cannot get drivers for anything other than PocketPC. I wanted to get this item and a CF-to-PCMCIA converter and use it in my laptop and my handheld, but DLink does not offer the drivers. Also, from the research I've done it looks like this card doesn't work with a lot of other wireless access points because they are using an old driver with antiquated security. DLink is nothing more than a reseller of hardware so there is an obvious lag in their driver support. I will probably be returning my 650W CF Wireless card and DI-713P Router/Switch/AP since their tech support has been less than abysmal."
1,Motor Burn Out,I used this vacuum for 2 years and had the motor burn out before the first year was up. It was still under warranty so Hoover replaced it at no change. Thirteen months later that motor burned up. I pitched this machine in the garbage. While it was working it did a good job of cleaning and I liked the attachments.
4,Good cd player,"I bought this player for 100 dollars for at the end of Nov 2008. After close to a month of usage, I have so far had no problems with it. The only problem I have is that there is no remote control, but you learn to live with it. Pioneer has always been real good to me, I had an older pioneer player for over 6 years. So i hope that pioneer has maintained its quality standards over the years."
4,Good unit but needs a remote,The unit is very good in playing CD's. I would like to have a remote with it.
3,OK for the money,"Twice the unit has stopped playing and gone into some kind of a free spin. Otherwise no complaints. If it keeps working with occasional spins, it will have been worth the small amount paid, but perhaps these spins indicate a terminal problem down the road."
2,If it worked,"This is in part my own fault I suppose. I refused to give in to the ipod and give up my CD collection. So I looked and looked for an affordable 25 - 50 disc changer. I found this one used and thought viola!It arrived looking decidedly thrift shop find, a bit like a relic in fact, but I thought oh well- if it works so what? So It wont be winning any snazzy equipment beauty contests.Unfortunately there seems to be some issue with loading the CD's. When I want to change a CD, I have to then spend 15- 20 minutes messing with the door to get it to shut properly so that whatever magic element is inside the changer will load the CD's and play them. To add insult to injury, it also occassionally wobbles and ""sticks"" on one track and the only cure seems to be turning it off and on until it stops doing so. I have no idea if this great ""find"" is going to make it through Christmas before refusing to do any work at all. When it is operational - its great!"
5,simple,"i have owned several cd chagers with rotateing tray ,they all quit when the motor brunt out .they were large and bulkey. the f407 is compac simple to load."
1,DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!!!!!,"I saved for a year to buy this cd changer, bought it a couple of weeks ago, and it will not read any CD ... just lifts them up and moves to the next one but does NOT play at all. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN PIONEER AND ALSO AMAZON FOR SELLING THIS TO ME."
3,PD-F407 PIONEER 25 COMPACT DIC PLAYER,"As far as the CD player itself, it works fine and forfills all promises advertised. BUT most CD player have their own amplifier and volume control. This unit is not a stand alone unit but part of a home surround sound system and does not have installed to its self an amplifier and volume control. This fact is not publicized. Now I have to purchase a Pioneer amplifier or return this player for all the options I thought was included. CASE IN POINT "" DO NOT ASSUME ""I would only recommend ths player to one that totally understands that it is not a stand alone unit.Not enough information was publicized in the description of this player, very mis-leading."
5,The Foxes Of Firstdark,"This was a very excellent book. Anyone who loves foxes or just likes animal stories will greatly enjoy reading this book. The way the author wrote it, it was like he knew all about their mythology. I'd say this would be the best fox story I've ever read, and I have read plenty of them..."
3,Ok for a beginner,"This product while great for a child will never be useful for someone who knows what they are doing with a microscope. For the money I think you can get a better product, but it is adequate."
2,Microscope,"Very expensive mistake on MY PART. My grandson broke it within one week. He did say he had fun with it...for the week. Would be great for an older child, (12 , at least )."
4,More of a review of Amazon's customer service,"I got this microscope for my granddaughter who is turning nine and who has a strong interest in science. It arrived yesterday and I immediately checked it out. Everything was in order except for the light switch which turns on the above or below stage LED illumination. The upper lamp had a problem, so I took advantage of Amazon's excellent return service (I just handed the box to the postman) and I expect the replacement will be delivered tomorrow! Before packing it up, I looked at some slides using the below stage illumination. I was pretty impressed with the what I saw. It is so much better than the microscope I had when I was her age. I am sure she will love this gift."
4,Great gift for the kids!,Plastic body but decent optics. Something you would expect of a Chinese product. It made a great gift for the kids though. Very happy with the purchase.
3,Basic Scope for beginner,"Simple scope for a beginner. Battery operated lights offer good illumination. Nose piece better than expected, however the ocular lens, while it did its job, was made of cheap plastic and will fall out when top cap is removed. Trying to get it seated correctly back in the tube was hit or miss and can easily introduce dust that is hard to eliminate. Blood cells were clearly visible as well as human hair and cheek cells. Great for studying insects, stamps, and jewelry etc. Repositioning slides under high magnification is tricky as the stage moves with the slightest touch. For $60 it's a little over priced for the overall quality, but if you are patient and gentle in using it you'll see some remarkable images."
2,design flaw?,"bought this after reading the good reviews for this microscope.There is a fundamental design flaw (unless I got one with a mfg defect). Objects seen through the eyepiece appear laterally inverted. When I placed penny on the stage with the 'Lincoln side' of the penny facing upwards, Lincoln's face points to the right in the penny, but when viewed through the eyepiece, the faces points to the left!! This lateral inversion makes it very counter-intuitive and difficult to get the desired area of interest into the field of view in the eyepiece.Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience for my kid."
5,"If you are looking for a children's microscope, look no more!","We have had this microscope for 2 years now and it is still going strong. We picked it up when our daughter was 6 for Christmas along with a nice set of prepared slides. Great gift for a kid fascinated with science. She loved looking at how a butterfly wing is made up of scales. Slides, dead bugs, leaves etc have made their way under the scope. Works great, the light is great and it is user friendly. The microscope became the center piece of her first science fair exhibit (all about butterflies)! I would highly recommend for the quality, education value and what a great deal it is for the holidays!"
4,Future Scientist Equipment,"Purchased this for my 10-year-old science enthusiast for Christmas.It was nicer than I expected. I wasn't expecting a lab-quality microscope, and it's not. But it isn't a cheap junky toy either. You're getting what you paid for.I purchased the extra slides too, and would recommend doing that."
5,Better than most beginner microscopes,I first bought the Celestron microscope w/ the digital camera for my son's birthday and returned it because it did not work very well (camera was all but unuseable). I ordered this one and am very happy. This microscope is mostly metal (NOT PLASTIC) and the optics are way better than my previous purchase. I would highly recommend this microscope for kids.
5,Great fun and great quality,"I purchased this microscope for my daughter for Christmas. We are having a great time looking at all sorts of things we find. The best part is the second light for viewing things that are opaque, such as coins, bugs, plants, etc. I was really impressed with the quality for the price. The microscope is well built, and comes with extra slides, stains, prepared slides, tweezers, test tube, and eyedropper. I would highly recommend this for a budding young scientist."
2,disappointed in quality,"weight of piece--felt cheap. White plastic is textured to look like metal in photographs, but it's definately plastic.the bottom light is faulty, AND the instructions included are only the most basic advice on using the microscope, sort of. Example--when we couldn't figure out how to make the bottom light light up, all the instructions said was ""turn on the bottom light to view..."" um, well THAT'S helpful. lol we figured it out pretty quick, but then found out the bottom light, which is LED is faulty. Either the LED itself, or the wiring we cannot tell, and it doesn't come with any spare bulb with which we could find out. There is NO customer service support line that we can find anywhere on the box or the product or the instructions. Really disappointed, as this WAS daughter's main christmas gift aside from some socks. The manufacturer really let us down. Would NOT recommend."
2,not well made,"The suit is poorly made and the helmet is lame. It is a flimsy plastic, comes in two pieces that then velcro together. The velcro doesn't stay on the plastic very well, and the helment is hard to get on and off for a child by himself."
1,CREAM OF THE CRAP,"I have been seeing the girls on YouTube. I expected to see the good shows but was very disappointed with these shows (a waste of money)I also know that Amazon is not at fault.I was wondering if the ""Best of Carol Burnett"" or ""The Best of Donnie and Marie"" or ""The Best of Tom Jones"" are in the same category. I will not buy any more ""The Best Of"" series ever again."
4,mmmmm good,this doesn't taste like your ordinary power bar. This taste justs like a candy bar! mmmmm goood!
2,Will not sustain YOU,"It's hard to imagine why would ever put this sugar loaded empty bar into their bodies. Maybe because they do not read often what this and similar bars contain. It is not much worthwhile. If you care for your health, look elswhere. Choose among these:Organic Food Bars -(this is actually the brand name).Lara-barsCocaCasava by Dr. MercolaLuna Bars (made with soy protein)Kashi Go LeanEnjoy 'n stay satiated 'n healthy!"
5,Very good service,I'm very pleased with VAC SHACK. My order was promptly shipped and received. Packaging was very sturdy. I will order from them again.
1,Sky of Stone,We never received this book. Amazon said there were none in the warehouses. We were disappointed.So why are we having to rate and review it?
5,AWESOME,"Hickam gets better with each book in The Coalwood Trilogy, and I nearly cried as I finished the final pages of this gem. I wanted MORE!!! Read it carefully!"
2,Don't bother,"I was pretty excited to see a dedicated treatment of Perl on Windows (Learning on Win32 systems doesn't quite cut the mustard) and bought this book. However, after finding 4 or 5 typos within the first 40 pages I decided it wasn't worth the investment. Many were pretty obvious (examples for gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr both used gethostbyaddr (or maybe it was vice versa)) but this many syntax typos this early in the book made me return the book. This is the right track but I'm going to wait for the second edition."
4,Good discussions on Perl and NT issues.,"Well written discussions on Perl and NT issues. Some topics were missing like MAPI and TAPI, but overall well written. I recommend it for anyone using Perl and NT."
3,Hoover Type A bags,Did not receive the Hoover bags I thought I would be getting (I have used in past). Instead received the bags specifically for odor control in vacuuming after animals. Funny thing is I gave my daughter my excellent Hoover to vacuum her carpets after her two large dogs.
2,Not what I needed...,This item was featured on my screen as a suggested item. I ordered the bags based on price but when they arrived they did not fit my vaccum ( which I bought from Amazon and for which I assumed were suggested) I had to send them back. Lost the shipping fees which kind of pissed me off.
3,short .....just like all the songs....,"Well I was exited at first since there are several tracks that are rare or imposible to find on CD, like cut class,magnifique and others but this compilation has a problem, its all edited to five minutes or less per song.I find it dificult to digest so much editing,Disco music and that includes high energy are all long tracks filled with intros and percurssion brakes just like a modern symphony this makes the composition. This CD all three are all edited like if they where to be played on AM radio...Now if you can live with short version this product has good mixes and plenty of tracks,but I understand you can only put so much in one CD.In other words it gives you a taste of this time period...."
5,Really helped me to understand how to work with crystals,"I love this deck! I knew a little about crystals, but didn't really understand how to use them, other than by carrying them with me. Naisha Ahsian's text allowed me to understand how their energies work, and I get very accurate readings with the cards. It's definitely not a ""what stone goes where"" book. Instead, it relates deeper guidance from the stones that answers the questions I ask about my life. The art is incredible. I often use the deck for meditation and connecting with the energies. I really recommend it for anyone interested in getting more understanding about the energies of crystals and stones."
5,Crystal Ally Cards,These cards are a great. I bought a set for myself and one for my sister as a gift and we both just love them!
2,Not stainless steel,"Contrary to the description, this product is not 100% stainless steel. The top part looks like steel, but it actually plastic.The activation button also needed to be pressed in ""just the right place"" to work.The salt mill did work when you pressed the button just right and the light worked as well. There is a spare bulb that comes with the salt mill. It is also preloaded with salt."
1,Poor Poor Poor Quality,I saw what I THOUGHT was the same set and Wms&Sonoma and then found these online. I bought them from Amazon since they were much cheaper. They are all plastic and arrived damaged. The clear plastic portion was broken on the salt mill and would not attach to the top portion. The peeper mill was cracked as well. They are very light weight and cheaply made. Get the real ones from the retail store. They are solid aluminum and real glass. I did. Amazon was pretty good about the return- after two phone calls to get my money credit back.
5,Excellent Comedy,"The hilarious MR. BEAN skits may be some of the best comedy ever produced. If you're hesitant about buying them, rent one first and see for yourself. Apparently Amazon is not presenting the entire series. Too bad. Most, if not all, of the episodes are available on VHS. The series exists on DVD but unfortunately it is incomplete; some fool arbitrarily cut some of the skits."
1,bad movie,i wondered why this series was so cheap an i found out that it is as exciting as logging in to a computer. do not purchase unless you like giving money away.
3,Huh?,well my own worst enemy pilot (Breakdown) was ok but did'nt hook me in like i hoped.i just did'nt believe in the christian slater character with split personalities just did'nt buy and i don't know if i'll watch next week episode. too bad interesting concept.
1,Great movie - poor product,"Ordered and received this hard to find movie before estimated delivery date which was Great! VHS movie (not yet out in DVD) quality was fair; however, movie was interrupted halfway into the movie with what appeared to be another movie. Movie did resume after a few minutes. Received requested review and reported problem - was promptly credited my money back. For the way this order was handled from start to finish, I give 5 stars! Great way to handle what could have been a dissatisfed customer!"
3,Good,I missed this series since i used to watch it as a kid growing up. so when i came across this collection i thought i should scoop it up. It's only flaw is that it doesnt include the three movies that continued the series after the show was done.
5,Love having the entire series,"I received the complete series in a timely manner, so I am happy about that. I also have watched several episodes so far, and it brings back wonderful memories of when I was a young teenager watching the show. If you are a fan of the Hulk series, definitely get this. And the price I paid was an absolute steal!"
1,"Thanks for nothing, Universal!","It's nice to know that this set is being released after the first four seasons already hit the street. Another gimmick from Universal to squeeze our hard-earned wages from our pockets? You bet!!!Before Universal announced the release of the 1st season, they released a fan favorite set entitled the Ultimate Collection. This collected the very best of the entire series knowing that the fans would clear the shelves. Seeing that they struck gold, they went ahead and released season 1. Season 2 followed, along with seasons 3 & 4, and not a word of a complete series box set until the damaged was done. Why? Simple. Milk the people dry!Hats off, Universal! I just hope you have enough space in your warehouses for all those complete series box sets that nobody's gonna buy."
4,Sexy Bat,Great sexy and fun that makes fun of that other movies -- This Bat is more Sexy than the Male model of the same -- Also their Joker not half bad
4,great first attempt,"I gave this book a 4 because once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I got involved with the characters in the book, especially Macy. I guess some people could lump this book together with any other romance novel commonly found on shelves at any store, but really it isn't. This book has true heart. While reading it, I would stop and think,""Is this really fiction?"" because it seemed so real. Maybe this is because I can more readily identify with the characters and their lives. I hope Ms. Sawyer's first novel is not her last."
2,waste of money!,the book is boring the stories short and not interesting. the book is more a travel book than a ghost book!
3,"Not great, not bad","The title says it all really. Not as much depth as some books, and makes good first time reading for anyone just starting out on this sort of thing. Each story gives a general overview, some witness accounts and maybe a picture. I've read worse and the writer is genuine in their research...I just wish there was more detailed information given. For people wanting some more indepth stories I'd recommend Brad Steiger's Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits and Haunted Places or Eddie Burks and Gillain Cribbs Ghosthunter."
4,Good book.,This is a good translation of a classican Mexican novel that deals with the fall and redemption of the human spirit.
5,Perfect replacement for 1999 Tahoe,Factory hood latch was broken around where it mounted to the body. Had the old one out and this new one installed in about 5 minutes.
1,Hood Release is poorly contructed!,"The hood release purchased was for '97 C1500 Chevy. During installation the pocket securing the cable end broke. Luckily, I was able to disassemble the old and the new hood release parts and make one good one. The new one is obviously made of a cheaper plastic. I would recommend anyone buying this part use extreme caution during re-assembly, or you may experience the same fate that I did. Insert the the cable lock in the side first, then insert the cable-end into the pocket. Good luck!"
5,"Unique, Exciting and Recommended","I love books that have intelligent, strong, independent heroines. There are so few. But Nick in Wake of the Hornet helps make this book so enjoyable and along the way you learn about airplanes and anthropology. I loved this book. On top of having a heroine I could identify with, Wake of the Hornet has a unique premise and is a real page turner from the moment Nick gets asked to fly out to a small island in the Pacific. Val Davis just keeps getting better and better."
5,1998 game is a blast to the past,"I remember buying this when it came out in 1998 just to get my hands on the 2 exclusive Star Wars action figures, the same size as the other Kenner figures. It was a Han Solo in the Stormtrooper suit from the trash compactor, and Darth Vader with removable dome helmet. They both came with light sabers. As it turned out the game was fun after all, and kept us busy that summer."
4,The book was easy and quick reading very well written,"The characters in this book were very believeable. I fell in love with this book, and found myself not able to put it down I finished it in one day. The author did a good job of developing the characters and I had no idea how the book would end up, which I liked. There is nothing worse than a predictable ending in a book. Blanche is a loveable sleuth and overall person, and I love the way she sticks it to those uppity members of the talented tenth. This book is not only a thrilling mystery, but a great social commentary, about class prejudice. The talented tenth theory is a joke and this book and history proves that. Great writing!!!! Two thumbs up."
3,Not much mystery,"Read this book because it is well written and has interesting characters, not because of the ""who done it"" aspects as there are few."
5,"Oh, My Gawd!!","Yum! Just simple, flat-out yummy-yum!Unfortunately, I have no scientific or sociological comments to make about these fabulous cookies. They just are amazingly good, equally enjoyed by kids and adults.Who needs expensive bakery cookies when Oreo can produce something as good as this?Get 'em, 'yall! You won't be sorry!"
4,Good Item,"I like the product, however one of the guides at the tip broke off while using it. I hope replacement guides are available."
4,Great trimmer,"I bought this trimmer to replace my Remington MB30. I have used it for about three weeks now, and I trim about twice a week. The blades cut cleanly and with ease. The adjustment is sturdy, I haven't been able to get it to slip to another setting. My old MB30 would slip constantly.The smaller trimmer is noisy, and the blades don't seem to be as sharp or as clean-cutting as the large blades, but since I don't use it for anything but detail stuff, it has been good.The blades are smooth and stay clean. The only complaint I have is the trimmings go everywhere. I hear that the only way around that is a vacuum model, but I haven't found one of those with the smaller trimmer. The length settings are a little different than my old one, but I like them better.This seems to be a good product, for the price."
1,Doesn't cut well,"I bought this for my husband for father's day to replace an old battery powered black and decker beard trimmer. He occasionally shaves his head also. This Remington was awful, it did not cut well at all. Luckily we hadn't thrown the old one awa. I did throw away the box for the new one. I didn't imagine that it would not be good. I wish I could return it, it's terrible."
1,Bad Battery -- won't run when plugged in,"A waste of money -- lasted less than five months before the battery died, won't even run when plugged in."
2,Not what I ordered,"The picture shows a Hoover allergen vacuum cleaner bag, sold in a package of three. I ordered two packages. What I received was six loose no-name bags. Not what I ordered and too small an order to go to the effort of returning them. If no-name bags don't bother you (and I doubt they have the same allergen filtration properties as the genuine Hoover bags), then go ahead and order these...but if you don't like a bait and switch, then I suggest you shop elsewhere."
2,"Full of information, but encyclopedic instead exciting","I bought this book to add more to my upcoming trip to Wyoming in October. I was hoping to read exciting stories from Wyoming's past like the adventures of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. However, this book is very encyclopedic and dry in its presentation of Wyoming's data. The information on the weather will be handy, but I could have done without the pages upon pages of data on soil composition and historical costs of cattle. This book is certainly full of information, just don't expect to be entertained by it."
4,Its really cute but you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it..,"I recommend this book for mostly preteens but high-schoolers are welcome, too! Its really cute and the story is very creative. Its a very neat mix of cats and girls. I can't wait to read the next one! I know its out but I haven't bought it yet. The pictures are really great and no offense to other anim`e artists but this is definately one of the better artists. Don't miss this because it belongs in your collection!"
4,Handy for small jobs.,"My hubby needed a small dustbuster for clean-up on network wiring jobs, and we picked this one up on sale. It has worked well for the light occassional use he gives it, but it is not the easiest to clean out. The attachments are a nice idea, but don't stay in place very well, and are more of a hindrance than a help. Overall, it's okay, but not the best."
3,not bad,"This vac is ok. It is a pain to clean when you after you use it to suck up water or any liquid. The attachments are pretty useless, but all in all the vac is pretty powerful."
2,Just doesn't last,"As others have mentioned, the battery life on this unit just dies after a year. It did do an OK job for the first few months, but ultimatly becomes a ""bad investment"". If you purchase this unit, you will find yourself shopping for another vac in a year."
1,Useless edition,"Guess my assumption was incorrect. I though any licensed amateur radio operator would be interested in sending updated material to potential licensee: Unfortunately this seller sent my friend (I paid for it) an out-of-date edition. Is this the public face we hams want to project? I think not. Would like to have my friend Darryl sent a used, but updated edition with the current question pool."
1,Useless as a price guide,"I picked this book up shortly after it first came out but was ultimately disappointed with it. Yeah, there were illustrations of some pretty pieces, but the values listed didn't seem to have much relation to the real prices Rookwood was being sold for at the time. One normally expects a certain amount of inaccuracy in a price guide when compared to actual market values. But the differences here were just so large that the book was useless. The pictures were nice, but you can find other books on Rookwood with more substance and equally nice pictures. Take a pass on this one."
1,Never appeared.,I never received this book and I waited for over a month. I contacted Fat City Books and they basically told me there was no way they could track it down. I won't buy from this distributor again. It was very upsetting as this was a Christmas present and I gave it plenty of time to arrive.
3,WAYNE DYER se contradice mucho ...,"He leido casi todos los libros de este escritor , pero este libro , no me gusto mucho como otros , porque en el Capitulo de la Independencia menciona que la mujer tiene que ser Independiente , y nunca depender de nadie y trabajar , EL SE CONTRADICE SOLO , porque el esta casado y tiene 7 Hijos , De que mujeres esta hablando ya que su esposa con 7 hijos no es esposa sino esclava ...."
1,Don't buy these!!!!!!,"If you're looking for a good quality S-Vid cable for your ""X"" then please don't waste your money on these cheaply made radio shack junk cables, instead look for the ""Monster Game Gamelink 300X"" from Monster Cable. Yeah, they cost more, but trust me they are top-notch quality ...out."
4,Composite is too blurry once you switch to S-video,"If you have never tried an S-video connection than you are truly missing out. Just make sure your TV has an S-Video out before you buy one though. The sharpness that you gain is immediately noticeable. Just imagine your sharpness bar being tripled(atleast) and then turning it to the max. That is about the equivalent sharpness that you gain from switching from the normal composite cables. Another secret to gain sharpness is to check to see if your TV has secret service settings. I think pretty much all do. For my Sony for example, I will press Display, 5, Volume Up, then Power and when the TV turns on I get these settings that I can change. If you know which ones control sharpness, you can turn it up a notch for some extra sharpness. This combined with an S-video cable will help you gain the most crisp image that your TV can display."
2,Fonetica Funky,"I was disappointed with this CD. Neither I nor my two year old daughter enjoy the songs. She does not seem to be learning any Spanish because the words in the songs are spoken too fast for her to understand and no translation in English occurs during the songs. The details stating the CD is for all ages was very misleading. The CD is definately for older children who already have learned Spanish and use the songs for review. Also, the CD only had eleven songs. I found other Spanish CDs more enjoyable for less money with many more songs."
5,Havana Confidential,Without revealing the text of this book all I have to say is that it is brilliant and a very interesting concept. It makes the reader ponder if this could really happen? or is the world particularly the Cubans in exile living this today? I am a strong believer in conspiracies...Makes you wonder...
4,Pretty good,"This compilation, while not comprehensive, either on The Police or Sting's solo career has good songs, just not very complete. What is here is good and the sound is very good, but this is for the most casual of The Police/Sting's fans. If you like a little of the Police and a little of Sting solo, this should be ok."
5,Huge Fan. I'm in Love with this CD!,"I love this CD! I have searched everywhere to find the perfect Sting album and I think I found it! Not only does it have my favorite Sting songs on it, but it also has my favorite Police songs on it too. I haven't stopped listening to it since I received it in the mail. I feel like I hit two birds with one stone with this album. It's perfect. :)"
3,Dangerous design,"We were rather surprised to find out that when this kettle whistles , you must not reach for the handle, but have to get pot-gloves instead. Why? The whistle is in the knob of the lid, right under the handle, exposing you to scalding steam were you to reach right for the handle. We closed up the whistle, removed the steam-restricting ball from the spout, and are now happy with the kettle, since the whistle is not a top priority for us. Now it is just the kettle we need. But as is, the kettle is not well designed."
1,Scientific Data Weak.,"As an engineer, I have to say I found the scientific data offered in this book to be very weak. I recommend Dr. Shettles book over this one. You will notice if you read both, that the advice is almost the complete opposite from each other. I ended up using Shettles and got the boy and later the girl I wanted."
2,Useful only on floors,"If you are planning to use this quick broom on carpets, it won't do a good job,it is only suitable for floors."
2,Good Song - Bad Mixes,If it were not for the two songs being so popular and fun these mixes are very techno and they are more music then song. I don't know why they didn't keep the basic song and build around it. Compliment Gloria. It sounds like the made the noise first and then added Gloria to it later as an after thought.They should have built on her and complimented the already popular song and the arrangement needed more strings and less techno. Not what I was hoping for. Oh well!
2,Bad Remixes,"not the remixes i was looking for, but however i do enjoy the song. I do not recommend this cd or these remixes."
3,spend your money somewhere else.... no need here,"I researched the lil' peice before buying it and found NO real purpose for having it other than just having something to plug in your joystick. Like the other reviewer said ""Made for those who have friends with XBOXes and want to trade/load/share their info with them"". I don't know anyone with an XBOX, so sharing files isn't a must for me right now.oNe"
5,"Why Amazon, why...","...do I keep getting emails to buy or review this product. I bought this at an unnamed box store the day it came out. (Hint: It rhymes with West Guy.) Anyway here goes.Pros: Awesome! Episodes are hilarious. The slipcover is disgusting.Cons: Only one dvd? I watched this in like two hours. The new volume of Squidbillies is the same way, which I pre-ordered from here.Verdict: If you are a fan, buy it. If you are not, start with season 1 and work your way up to this."
3,"Solid episodes, but I don't like the one disc format","In switching to a single disc format, this 'volume' actually combines highlight episodesfrom seasons 6 and 7, so, unlike all earlier volumes, there are now a number of episodessimply not available on DVD. That itself is a major disappointment.It also means the extras are a lot skimpier, and feel like less effort went into them.There are three episodes I'd consider among the series best, although there are also a couple of the leastfunny ever as well. For me, the highlights were ""Fry Legs"", ""Rubberman"" and ""Eggball"", but as always, whichepisodes you like best is likely to vary from person to person.Worth it if you're a fan, but very disappointing in terms of approach."
5,This show is hilarious!,"This is one of the best and most hilarious shows on Cartoon Network. It is weird and funny and strange and adult themed for sure. It has gone through many name changes now, but this is one of the best late night shows you can watch. You need to buy this DVD set, sit back and crack up."
3,Make my butt look big,I mean they made my butt look big in a good way. I've worn this pair on a number of rides. Whether it's an easy 20 or a century ride these shorts keep my junk from going numb. I can peddle for miles with this pair on.Drafting!
3,Average,"These shorts look nice but the padding does leave something to be desired. Of course, they are rather inexpensive but if you put serious miles on your bike, you'll want some better padding. These just don't compare to more expensive shorts"
4,Good price - good product,"Fast delivery, although s & h was MORE than the product (or I'd give it 5 stars.)"
3,"not the right belts, contacted seller","At first I rated this 1 star, because it Doesn't fit my Hoover, These are not the right belts. I even rechecked the instructions and product number does match on the description and order, but number on the actual belts do not batch.(Update)After contacting seller, they immediately offered to send the right belts. Very good customer service, responded the same day that I contacted them, eventhough it was almost 6 months since I had originally purchased the belts. It took me that look to have a need to use them."
3,Amazon needs to update ad - Very deceptive.,"I concur with the previous reviewer about the photo and description being incorrect. It does show two belts in the photo. One would assume this is one quantity. Also the description is confusing: ""Product Description - 2 replacement vacuum bags for use with the Windtunnel canister vacuum with power nozzle agitator or belt"". I suppose I should have realized there was only one belt because of the price but sometimes you rely on the photo. If I realized it was only one belt per order, I still would have ordered, but this is just a subtle way to influence your purchase."
1,Philips 50PF7320A Plasma TV,"Great Looking, but stay away...several drivers went bad, so vertical lines, then the power supply died...after many calls to Philips Customer Service, they replaced with a 49inch LCD...MUCH BETTER."
3,worked pretty well... before its 3 month birthday,"i didnt buy this transmitter from amazon, but the item's lack of durability is so notable that i just have to write this review. it worked quite well for it the first 3 months. charges my ipod video 30 and the transmite quality was pretty good. but recently without a warning it just blows out... doesn't charge my ipod anymore and the sound quality diminished... i placed it at a very safe space in my car so then for sure no one stepped on it or anything like that... im sadden, costs 30 and now im 30 bucks short of what i expected"
3,Not as catchy as self-titled,"Much better than Helldorado. The songs are not as catchy as their earlier stuff. Hardcore fans will be enthused. Newcomers, get one of there first three albums. They're much better."
4,Decent buy,"Nice sturdy product. Makes a little noise when pulling on the tether though, so if you intend to use if for hunting it may scare the game if you pull on it quickly. May be able to get away with pulling on it very slowly though."
1,TRASH!!,"This controller is a huge waste of money. I am dissapointed Interact would allow this to happen. The buttons don't work, it moves by itself (in the game Halo), and I get an error message when its plugged in. Please send the extra money and get an official one!"
2,Good but not worth the savings,"I too bought this controller because of its cost compared to the MS one. I have found that the buttons are too hard to press except the sticks. I am constantly pressing the zoom button on Halo when I am trying to simply just move around. Like someone else wrote, I too am getting an error message sometimes that interupts my game and tells me to plug the controller back in(?). For the extra (money) the MS contoller is the way to go. It's more comfortable, more accurate, and in general a much better controller."
5,history for everyone and for specialist,it's really global history. it's easy for everyone but it's usefull for specialist of history. wonerful maps.sorry for my english.thank you.
2,Hoover Belts,The item delivered not the Hoover belts which was ordered. Delivered was a replacement belt for a cleaning tool. The invoice was also that of another person.
2,"Wrong Direction, Again","Add me to the group that gives Guster credit for not continuing to try to remake ""Lost and Gone Forever"" over and over again, but this is not the best use of this band's talent. Ditto: where are the harmonies? Ditto: I understand Joe doesn't want to be tied to the bongos forever, it limits their sound, but the drumming is too generic. Gentlemen, this album makes you sound too much like everything else that's out there, and believe me, that's a BAD thing. I was a fan of Guster in the first place, because you were different. Now you sound like an amalgam of the top 20 bands on the college charts, but without being interesting. Try again..."
2,I Miss the Old Guster,"My favorite album ever to be released by this group was Lost and Gone Forever. I feel like Guster is drifting more and more away from their true talents, such as using percussion drums and more acoustic guitars like they have in the past. The Only songs I care for on this new album are ""Hang On"", and ""Lightning Rod."" I hope they will go back to using these talents in the future to make and write better music. As the title reads I do miss the old Guster."
2,Downhill spiral from the original days...,"Ever since they took Banjoe-Joe on, and changed the dynamic of the group their music has gone completely downhill. It has become very generic and not nearly as good as the original stuff. Parachute, Goldfly, and lesser so Lost and Gone Forever, were the only good albumns. L&GF; was the album that helped them get traction on the Pop charts adn you started seeing them play larger venues. Then Ganging Up on the Sun came out, and it was a huge nosedive.I miss the old Guster, the original ""Gus""."
1,piece of garbage,"The bottom of the drawer is made of CARDBOARD. Not particulate board or composition board, but cardboard as from shirts in a laundry. The claim that the piece originally sold for $199.00 is lunacy--or, actually, is designed to be deceptive. The is an oak nightstand that Sears has for $10.00 more that is actually made of wood. I have urged Amazon to take this ite off their web page"
3,Canister,"It does pick up well, but the bags are small and have to change often. the onboard tools are never onboard- they always fall off. We use this in our RV so it does okay, but I would never use this as my house vacuum"
3,display,i spent 2699 dirhams and i have chosen the philips 32 inches colour lcd and the pic which was at the showroom was absolutely perfect but know when i buy philips and when i has started the tv in my home than i was shocked that what happen to the picture i was totlly shocked that television picture quality is not good as it was on the show room it was crystall there in the show room but now its totally bad no pixels nothing so my request is this that will u plz send me what can i do know to improve the colour quality and when i open the box i found no full material to guide how to operate tv
4,Tow truck,My 4 year old grandson loves this truck. I just wish it had a little more metal. He is going to take this outside in the spring and I hope it can take the constant hauling of outside things. It's a great truck and he can operate it easily. The timely manner in which I received it was super. I had trouble locating it in the stores so Amazon was a lifesaver. Thanks
4,butterfly child will hypnotise you,"this album is alot softer than soft explosives,onomatopoeia is a whirlin dervish replayed in slo-mo so no one can miss the intricate beauty that spins lace all over this record.you can see joe cassidy is moving into a more pop direction with this album,but hes always going to have that etheriel voice and gorgeous writing style.buy this record for peace."
4,eureka!!!,"I finally found it!!! After all of my years of searching, it's finally mine!!! Mwwaaahh ha ha ha!!!"
5,F5300 Floormax - A guy's Review,"I previously owned a Hoover wet/dry/vac floor scrubber that I received from my mother when she moved into her condo. She used the machine for years (she had purchased it in the '70s). After a few years of extensive use, I had to replace it. I have a lot of tiled and hardwood floors, and this machine cuts my work in half. I didn't have a problem with attaching the handle, as some reviewers have commented. It does a great job - hope it lasts as long as the previous machine. I greatly missed the machine during my search for the replacement."
4,Lord of the Two Lands,"Amazing Novel - Meriamon, daughter of the last pharoah, must bring Alexander to Egypt and convince him to take up the position as pharoah of the Two Lands.This book is a wonderful read, the relationship between Alexander and Haphaistion, as more than just lovers, is clearly displayed. Meriamon's commitment in fullfilling her duty to her country and to her King is reminiscent of Tarr's strong female heroines. It also has its lighter notes with Alexander's brother Arrhidaios and the fictional chracter Nikos who is Mariamon's love interest.All in all Tarr has captured the essence of the characters perfectly, you feel as if you know them and wish you could have met them!""King & Goddess"" is also another one of my favorites by Tarr (displays the life of Hatsepshut, Queen-Pharaoh of Egypt)"
1,Not the first Roseville book I'd buy,"I would call this ""book"" more of a pamphlet. Author focuses too much on Roseville that I would call more rare. There was no identification for what I might call the more common patterns. This book probably would be of help to the collector who is targeting the higher end items. From a physical standpoint, one of the pages is not even bound into the pamphlet."
2,Ready to Run (Away),"This is the most basic code libray you can find just about anywhere else for free. The examples are so basic - if they at least gave better definitions it might be usefull...but the way it is it's worthless. I read some of the other reviews and bought this book...I went thru it in about 25 minutes, knew it all and found that I have don't things simpler than this book has. This might be good for the 1st time programmer at anything...otherwise save your money...you'll be sending it back like I am."
1,The worst book i have ever read,"I am the brother of the girl you wrote about i knew her better then my parents, her own mom and definitly you. All you did was make the good people look bad and the bad look good. This was the worst book i have ever read. You had know idea what you were writting about. But i can see other people dont care for it either."
4,I Loved it.,"More and more, I'm growing fond of westerns; and when I saw that Bill Pullman (I'm a big fan of his) was actor and director in this film, I just had to see it. I saw it uninterrupted and loved it. The scenery was breath taking and, ah, the sound of those violins. I thought Mr. Pullman did a real fine job in the role of the Virginian and as director. Diane Lane was a good choice for the role of Molly Stark. James Drury was impressive as the messenger. In fact, applause to all concerned. Although it may go against the tradition of the previous ""Virginians"", I'm hoping Mr. Pullman does a sequel. This video won't be available for sale until February 2001, and I've already placed my order. I can't sign off without commenting on the review from Copacabana, Australia. It was appalling and should have been banned."
5,The virginian,"I knew the movie because I had it on vhs tape. Wanted to replace it with a dvd Am very pleased with it.I did not find any dull spots,kept my interest from first scene to last."
5,Great CD,"From start to finish, this CD in my opinion is very enjoyable. I think the band does a great job on most songs and on some like ""Thank You"" and Bell Bottom Blues, they are outstanding. I've been listening to Tesla since the GRC and I have no problem with another cover album. I would love to hear many of these tunes played live along with all the old favs. Enjoy the Cd for what it is, a great rockin' CD that doesn't quit. See ya the shows....."
5,TELSA,"I bought this for my BF he was so surprised he had this CD before and someone borrowed it he never got it back when this came in the mail he was just so happy he had a smile from ear to ear, Im happy with everything service the people etc. NO complaints here at all"
2,You get what you pay for.,"One of the cheapest ratcheting screwdrivers and not worth much more that the $4.00 it cost. It has a weak, cheap ratcheting mechanism and adjusting collar. Best for light duty work."
2,not good!,"I got one of these with my Remington 960 electric shaver and found the quality to be very poor, especially the side burn attachment. All the parts have a cheap feeling to them. It broke within a few months, I'm looking for a better product."
1,Didn't like it,"I had a Remington Titanium before this one...and I thought I was buying the same one, but when I got it, it was horrible. It pulled your hair and it cut. The one I had before looked just like this one except it had the word ""titanium"" on the front...I don't know what model that one was, but I'm searching for it. That one worked really good. It didn't cut and pull your hair like this one. I thought maybe I was just careless the first time I got cut, but it did it every time I used it, so I tossed it after about 3 times of use."
4,Remington PG-150 Personal Groomer,"I have been using these small groomers from Remington for a number of years but they always came with a rechargeable battery which managed to last about a year before it would no longer hold a charge. I couldn't find the appropriate battery pack to replace it with so I would have to buy a new one - a waste of money. Now they have come out with one that uses AAA batteries (I use rechargeable ones) that not only works as well as the old ones but I should have for a number of years. Incidentally, the old accessory heads work with this new unit. Since the new one no longer comes with a stand, I use the old recharger stand to hold it and the various accessories. All in all a good product to do the little trimming jobs that a body requires."
4,One of the best Adult Titles,If you are looking for a good adult title that has a combination of action and a Guyver-style fights...then this is a good one. Though it is still considered as a Hentai title due to some explicit scenes but it is much better than those other tentacles shows and for sure less gross ;D
1,This book is NOT written by Jason Theodosakis,I am a personal friend of Dr. Theodosakis and not only has he not had any part in writting this book he has NOT EVEN READ IT! You are deceiving the buying public by listing him as the author and I strongly suggest that you correct this error!
3,Haven't read it in a while,"but what I can remember from the book is that I thought it was very good. I have so many books, that I forgot about what some of them were about. But this one, i thought was pretty good. I'm in the process of catching up on some the old books that I haven't read in a long time."
1,"video clips are so outdated, they won't even play!","don't waste your money, i have spent so much time trying to find the codec to view these video clips and they won't work with any xp or vista machine. i'm asking for a refund and will buy the book instead. what a disappointment. good info from keith code, but this version is horrible."
2,Really not worth buying if been riding for over 3 months,"For people who have no experience in riding, reading this book may be helpful since it shows the basic ideas of riding with pictures. However, once you started riding, almost all things mentioned in this book will be understood/felt via little experience. I will recommend saving your money and take your bike to the race track a couple times after you ride for 6 months. You will learn a lot on the race track in a safe manner; you also learn how well your bike can handle those turns you think it can never make."
1,Waste of money! Worse than VHS.,"If you want Max Fleischer cartoons, your best source is VCI's ""DANCING ON THE MOON"" DVD release. That release uses 35mm when possible and good quality 16mm prints otherwise. No faded prints on the VCI DVD.This DVD is just a poor attempt to sell Public Domain cartoons."
3,Book suffers from a major lack of editing...,"Pamela Gardener runs her car off the road running from an unseen assailant and her life is never the same afterward. Enough has been said by other reviewers about her life after the accident and the ghosts she sees or imagines she sees.I gave this story three stars because, from the very beginning, the writing is hopelessly repetitive. I was reading along in the first chapter and encountered a section that repeated what had already been written. I paged back a few pages and sure enough, I had just read a paragraph repeating almost word for word exactly what had happened before. This trend continues through the entire first half of the book - it almost seemed like the author was forcing the text ... trying to reach a publishable word count. The lack of editing definitely took away from any pleasure I would have found reading this book. It is definitely not a keeper."
3,"An Effective Story, but Verbose and Drawn Out","""A.J. Matthews"" is the pen name of Rick Hautula, a very accomplished horror writer who has been writing horror fiction for the past quarter century.FOLLOW is very well written, but Hautula has a rather verbose writing style. He devotes many pages to describing the scenery and the thoughts/reactions of the highly neurotic main female character. This novel begins and ends well, but the middle of this novel is rather slow paced and repetitious. FOLLOW would probably work quite well as a short story, but as a novel I thought it was a bit too drawn out.This is also one of those novels where you're not entirely sure what's going on until the end. It has a kind of surreal and dreamy style that probably won't work for everyone. This book is more spooky than scary.Still, this novel is highly readable, and Hautula does a good job creating a creepy, almost gothic atmosphere. I give this book a very mild recommendation, but not to readers who enjoy fast-paced plots."
3,Wishing for more,"The author does a fairly good job of telling those of us who paid for the book where we can find some trout in the Rocky Mountains. If you are like me and have traveled hundreds of miles into the back country (Wyoming is a perfect example) only to find ""no tresspassing"" signs EVERYWHERE at the end of EVERY road, you too will wonder why strip maps (or any maps at all) were not included in this book. If you are thinking to get this book for photos of wilderness and wild trout - forget it - there are only a few photos. If you are willing to invest a lot of time (and money on topo maps)trying to find the spots in the book, and have loads of free time to pick apart the directions while peering over a map this is a good book. I am willing to hump a pack up a mountain to fly fish for wild trout - I just think the book could of left out the first 142 pages and included maps and photos and made a great guide book..."
5,Great Job!,"I just purched this toy along with the P-51 Mustang, Bf-109, jeep and Panther tank at your Greensboro NC store. for the price the detail is outstanding. Yes there is some minor details that might need to be addressed but all in all 21st Century toys did a great job. As an adult scale modler there are some things that I can enhance on these modles. In the same respect if I tried to build any of these modles from a kit it would cost at least 3 times the amount of money I spent in your store. I hope to see more products from 21st Century toys XD line in your stores in the near future."
5,Fantastic M4 Sherman Tank,"I have been building armor models for 40 years and this ""toy"" is more accurate and has better detail than a scale model that would cost twice as much and require days of work to achieve the same result. I am also the proud owner of the same manufacturers German Panther tank, hopefully they will produce more variations of their excellent WWII models."
5,Fluffy White Rice In 60 Seconds,"My family tends to eat in ""shifts"", and we eat a lot of rice. If I cook a pot of rice, it takes 30 minutes, and is cold and sticky by the time my family gets to it. Now, my boys can have their rice when they want it. Viva La Rice works great for lunch, too. We really like this product!"
5,Great printer,"This is a great printer, which is probably why Canon stopped making it. There are no special print cartridges needed to print photos. I used photo paper and the regular cartridges and made great photos. This was the mistake of Canon, they made an inexpensive printer that would print photos cheaply and realized they were going to lose a bunch of money not selling photo cartridges. Hopefully they will make another printer like this. The printing is very fast, almost as fast as my laser, quiet, and of exceptional quality. If you can find it buy it, you won't regret it."
1,I couldn't finish it,The stiff-as-a-board expository dialogue alone ruins this book. Simply dreadful. Save your money.
3,Married with Children Season 10,"As a fan of Married with Children, I recently bought the 10th season, I have the first 9 on dvd, and there are a few good episodes, Requiem of a dead Briad (this is the last episode featuring the beloved family dog Buck), Blond & Blonder (Kelly goes to her 5 year high school reunion and suffers an ex-nerds revenge) and the two part spring break episode, I must say the show is getting tired, and at times it feels like the actors are just going thru the motions, While these episodes may not be up to the standards of earlier seasons, they are still funnier than most of what is on todayRazorback fan"
3,Be careful,"I picked a Remington Vacuum Trimmer (cordless, rechargeable)version at a local retailer when the vacuum feature caught my eye. My son fidgets so during haircuts hating the loose hairs that fall on his neck and ears. Also, he has extremely thick, course hair that frequently clogs clippers. This worked just fine at cutting and quite well at vacuuming up those trimmed hairs as you went. We both were much happier. After using it a handful of times though, I bumped it rather hard against the counter. While nothing was broken, the blade mechanism popped out. It had a spring load thing that made it impossible for me to get the blade back into position. I ended up tossing it after numerous attempts to get it back together."
3,Haircut Kit,"This is a great little device. It works as advertised. I have only used it twice so far, but it does in fact keep my hair trim and even. I do warn you though that this device is for very short hair. The longest it can be set to is 1 inch so if you are looking for a longer cut then that, this is not the device for you. If you are looking for 1 inch or less then this is an easy way to trim without making as much of a mess as a normal trimmer would make."
4,Worth the Cost,I was paying $14 for a haircut. My hair has thinned out so much that it wasn't worth paying this anymore. This clipper was recommended by a friend and I have been using it for a few months. I use the 1/4 inch guard and just go over my whole head once a week. It's very easy to use and paid for itself quickly. The only negative thing I can say is that it pulls on my hair if I go too quickly. This may just be because my hair is so stiff. I recommend this product.
3,Good enough for me,"Pros:As is the main appeal of the item, most of my hair is captured by the vacuum. As far as cutting goes, it works without any issues. One reviewer noted that the vibration dampening kept him from being able to apply a fade, however I was able to get a great fade when cutting my own hair even though I'm an amateur.Cons:I don't have this problem, but I could clearly see as one reviewer noted that if you have very thin hair, it would just pass right through the filter and fly out the other end. Do beware of this and do not buy if your hair is very thin.Also, there is no small adjustment knob to fine-tune the cutting length, and the trimmer doesn't come with the 3/8"" or the 5/8"".Lastly, when using the blade directly on the skin, it can be pretty painful.Pretty much, if you aren't too concerned about the above and you don't have time to clean up, this is for you. But if you don't mind cleaning up afterwards and you are concerned about the above, there are better products out there."
4,Hair Clippers,"Excellent hair clippers, no mess or fuss. Little clean-up after haircut.This is the second one that I have purchased. Bought my husband one & our daugther-in-law loved it, so we bought her one as a gift, so that she can cut our two year old grandson's hair."
2,Kassie Depaiva,This is a very mediocre CD lacking any songs with substance. She has a very lightweight childish singing style.
4,Ed's review.,Worth buying even if it's in Italian. Michelin has never let me down. My second or third edition have also purchased France and Germany. The Green book on Italy has Italy's history and is in English.
3,So-so,"There are better versions of Ernani than this. This hyper-dramatic work is sporadically dramatic in this version.Good: Sound and perspective are fine. The orchestra plays well. Lamberti's conducting keeps things moving and he does not drown the singers.Sylvia Sass's singing is alert and stylistic.No-So-Good: Both male leads. Neither is a top line singer based on this effort. The tenor, Lamberti, does not have an especially attractive voice and his singing is effortful. The baritone sounds sluggish in his big first act aria. Aaargh."
5,outstanding music!,"anyone who was a slowdive/ride/or any shoegaze at all fan,must check these guys out.simply amazing modern shoegaze band,a must!"
1,"Unintentionally hilarious, but worthless as history","Although I'm pretty sure the author was serious when he wrote it, this book is filled with factual errors and bizarre logic which had me howling with laughter. All theories of alternate ""Shakespeares"" which I've seen rely on factual distortions and arbitrary assertions, but this book is worse than most. Read it for its entertainment value, but for God's sake don't start to take it seriously! For a lot of facts about Shakespeare, and refutations of the most common Oxfordian claims, visit the Shakespeare Authorship page on the Web.Dave Kathman djk1@ix.netcom.com"
2,Not good for beginners to keep up with,This video was too hard to follow. They make too many changes in the routine too quickly and sometimes it can be hard to keep up with the changes.
2,not necessarily for seniors!,"I am a 71-yr-old woman, wanting to find an exercise video to use regularly. This video is a bit too intense for me. Also, she doesn't give instructions as well as I would like them."
1,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this video. This is so fast I can't even keep up with it. Maybe they need to say that this is not a beginners workout, even though it is Low Impact. I will not be purchasing any other Weight Watchers Workout videos."
1,Taylor Made Boat Fender Hanger,"I found absolutely no advantage to using these, actually they were cumbersome to use,if dropped in the water (sloppy-I know)they sink like a rock. There are better options available.."
2,"nice ring, but not happy with it","This ring looks great once you open the box. but put it on and within a few days it turns, and becomes more silver than gold. the stones still sparkle, the ring scratches easily. Poorly made, wish I had put my money elsewhere."
2,Small,"This product was not worth the price I paid for. The product is too small. If you want to use the product to jot down only a phone number, than this product is a great gift."
4,A good inspection bought,The story of Cher and Luc is good. The met in college and were kept apart by Luc's wicked mother. Well Luc's mother is murdered and the murderer is found not quilty.Which leads to Luc needed Chers help in solving a case. She is in charge of Cold Case unit in Phoenix. Well does she get a surprise when she sees Luc. They have a 13 year old daughter together he doesn't know about. She turns Luc down and he goes over her head. According to the back of the book He makes a hefty contribution to a campaign fund. Which in turns makes her change her mind on helping.I enjoyed the story.It was my second J M Jeffries and I wasn't disapointed.
3,Had so much potential,"The assembly of this pool float took some time, but I managed to do it and everything was working just fine. Took it to the pool and had some problems with it in the water. One ""motor"" had diminished power although it seemed to work just fine when I tested it outside of the water. Even if the motors don't work correctly, the float itself is large and very comfortable and the electric air pump to inflate it, works great."
4,"I am happy ""but...""","If you are looking for mp3 player with both am and fm, don't bother. I was, and just decided to purchase this as an addition to my ipod.Here's what's good:- small size, lightweight, and looks good- reception is great- very long battery life, repeat, VERY long battery life- excellent sound, especially with deep bass boost featureHere's what's not so good:- no backlight for LED display- memory presets erase when you change battery- sub par headphonesBottom line, like I said, I'm happy and would purchase again. But, for the price I would expect a backlight as well as memory retention. Greatest feature is the long battery life, I use it daily and haven't changed battery in 2 weeks. Simply put, I would tell Mom to buy it, and who wants to let Mom down after all she has done for me."
5,Great Product,"Small size, good layout on controls. Use it for walking, biking, and when I can't sleep at night. Good battery life. Like it a lot better than the SONY that finally gave out on me."
5,Best Portable Ever,"I had been using a Sony sport style am/fm at work where it only took a few days to break the arm band mount. I then continuously broke headphone cords as the unit was designed with the jack on the side, causing the cord to pinch over itself on the way out of my pocket. I searched fruitlessly until I found the Sangean Dt-120. It's narrow, small, flat, and most importantly has the headphone jack on top. Reception is great, even indoors, and seems to have less positional distortion problems than the Sony. I'm very pleased with this product. It has an auto-off option witch is easily disabled if you choose; more presets than I need, and a locking function to prevent accidental channel, volume or on/off changes while I'm working. It sounds great and has a bass boosting function if you so please. I'm more than Happy with my choice, you will be too."
4,Nice little package of sound,If you're not looking for an mp3 player but instead want a radio then this one's for you.
5,Very Good Radio,"Of all the small radios i have owned this is te best one. I really like the digital tuning and the presets it has. Also, it has no problem picking up the stations in my area."
5,Amazing Sangean DT-120,"I was looking for a high-quality yet portable pocket radio under $50 when I spotted the Sangean DT-120 AM/FM Stereo Pocket Radio. It is well worth the investment, having exceeded my every expectation. The reception is stellar, even in places where a radio signal normally wouldn't be picked up very well (e.g. away from a window). The 1 required AAA battery lasts for over 24 hours of playing, even with the Dynamic Bass Boost and the stereo option on. (The radio can output audio in mono as well.) There is room for 10 FM presets and 5 AM presets. In addition, the radio immediate stops playing upon removal of the headphone plug, thus saving energy. There is also the option to have the radio shut off after 90 minutes of play. All in all, I highly recommend the purchase of this product."
5,Great Reception,"After purchasing a Sony unit and finally being overwhelmed by the heavy static on FM stations, I purchased/tried this radio and it is MUCH BETTER!"
4,Sangean Dt-120 White Pocket Am/Fm Digital Radio,Great pocket sized radio. Easy to program and operate. The only fault with the radio is the ear phones. While they have adequate sound they have flimsy wiring and one plug came apart after two weeks.The radio has good reception however the AM band is directional but this is normal. If your out walking you will find that you have to turn the radio a bit at times to keep the signal good.I would give this radio five stars if it weren't for the ear phones.*Amazon really stands behind their products. The first radio that I received was defective and they had me a new one in three days.-----------Thanks Amazon
2,Great but bulky,"I saw this walker when I was 7 months pregnant... had to have it, now I wish i had looked more. It has great colors and makes lots of cool sound like a car. But my daughter can't really get around in it.The wheels do not allow her to go straight. She seems to turn everytime. And get very agrivated because she is stuck on the wall. The red tabs to secure it from rolling really cut your fingers when adjusting it. and I hate that it does not colapse. I am military stationed overseas and cannot go out to any Babies R Us and buy another one. SO we are stuck with it.I remember my niece has the Bear walker from Baby Trend. It has great toys on it and folds nicley under her crib when not in use. I know my life is about my child now but does her toys really have to take up my WHOLE house???Also, Just because it is expensive does not mean it is the best. $.. would have been a much better investment."
2,VERY LOUD AND WONT TURN EASILY!!!,"My daughter just received this walker as a gift. It is so loud that I had to place pieces of cardboard and tape over the speaker on the bottom. It also will not turn easily. It will go forwards and backwards, but not to either side. I have NEVER heard a baby toy that was so loud!! I think if they added a volume button on this walker it would be great. It would also be helpful if they redesigned how the walker turns."
4,Can't live without it,We got this as a shower gift. I started my daughter in it around 3 months and she still loves it (now almost 7 months). She will sometimes cry when we hold her because she wants to walk in it. She follows us all over the house and has no problem going from carpet to tile! She has spent hours in this walker and been completely happy. The best part is it does not mark my walls and is height adjustable. The only bad part is she will not stop chasing our cat and Akita. I highly recommend this item!
1,tip hazard,"I bought this walker for my baby when she was 5 months old. I had researched all of the available styles of walkers and stationary entertainers and decided this one would be best (only drawback was that it does not collapse) Everything was wonderful until last week (baby now 7 1/2 months) when she grabbed a stationary object and pulled the entire walker over on it's side. Graco informed me my daughter is too active to be in a walker, but that reasoning totally eliminates why we buy walkers for our children in the first place. I do not recommend this walker for the saftey factors of your child. My opinion is that this walker needs to be remanufactured so that it is not easily pulled over by a 17# child while they are sitting in it."
4,"Was skeptical, but love it!!!","I read all of the reviews for these walkers and thought abot not getting one at all. Then I was in toys r us and pulled one down from the shelf and put my 6 months old son in one. He loved it. Running down the aisles.We had an old one that my husbands mom gave us from when her kids were little. OUr son could not move it an inch. We thought it was jsut because he was too young (not even sitting up by himself yet). Then I tried all four walkers that babies r us/toys r us carries. Low and behold he could move this one easily! It was the only one he could seem to move, so we bought it.It works on hardwood (no scrathes), works on our carpet (it is a flatter carpet not the fluffy type). It is super light. I can carry my 22 pound baby in one arm and carry the walker up the stairs with the other free hand.An on off switch for the activity center part of it would be nice, but taking the batteries out is not that big of a chore."
4,Own the first vol. Disappointed on the second!,"All I can say is if you expect to get a nice steel box like the first vol.....This is not for you! After that being said,I love the Real Ghostbusters and I would purchase these dvds individually, but I want to be offered the same thing as the complete collection.I do not want a dvd in a plastic keepsake with a cardboard slip cover! This is an insult! Thanks TimeLife! If you love the Real Ghostbusters and do not want to spend 140,150,170 dollars on a complete collection then buy this and try to be happy.At least you can own the Ghostbusters at an affordable price. You get 5 discs with the episode guide booklet minus the steel box.Other than the fact that I dislke not getting the steel box, I'd recommend this box set for everyone that loved the show."
5,The Real Ghostbusters at their real best,"I know it's a bit silly watching a kid's cartoon as an adult. But I loved this show in college, along with my roommates, and well, it's still a guilty pleasure.This set really contains some of the best episodes of the show, from the famous Cthulhu episode, to the one parodying Citizen Kane, the one with the battle between werewolves and vampires, to my personal favorite of the show, the one were a guy plots to bring about Ragnarok because he got dumped by his girlfriend."
2,Perky Pet 3221 Grandview feeder,"Feeder lasted 3 days. Squirrels were on it continually and thus birds never had a chance. The squirrels eat or chipped away the green plastic cup guards and had a banquet. Almost all of the green plastic feeder stations were on the ground in three days and this became a squirrel feeder. For me, I wasted my money plus feed $8.00 worth of good quality birdseed to the squirrels."
5,Bird feeder,"Working out just great. The feeder draws cardinals, blue jays and much more. I fill it once a week."
5,Incredible!,"This was an amazing book that I could not put down. It has a lot of action and is face- paced. The novel takes you through many emotions. The part of the book that stood out in my mind the most is how much you feel for the main character, Larka . You really get inside her and go through the book as if ou were there with her. The book is about a pack of wolves who are cursed by an evil wolf. One of the wovles discovers she has the sight, which is part of an ancient proficey(?). The novel shows how the proficey develops and how the wolves struggle. I would recommend this book for older children because it is a very harsh novel. ALso check out the author's other book, ""Firebringer."""
3,The Sight,"It was a good book. Well written. It didn't take me long to read it. The overall story was excellent, but the end was quite depressing. Sure, Morgra and her pack got what was coming to them, but...My heart fell when Larka did. I'd have liked to have seen her and Kar have pups of their own, start a new pack, so on and so forth, but like I said it was depressing. I also did not like the vision. It was a good leadup, but the vision was a letdown. I would recommend the book, but I would recommend Fire Bringer first."
5,"Great, great read","This book deals with the magnitudes of good and evil in ways that some people have only dreamed about.It follows the main character, Larka, a white wolf, through her hazards as she is pocessed with the gift, or curse, known as ""The Sight."" She must reckon with the forces of good and evil, pain and pleasure, and the torture between sacrifice and selfishness.This book all too clearly shows the struggle of humans with themselves, but this time, it does it with wolves, as Adams' did to beautifully with ""Watership Down."" This book compares with Adams' all too nicely. I like this book better.It is thought-provoking and leaves questions, and it leaves you feeling the pain that the characters must go through. It frees your imagination.I would recommend this book to anyone, because this book relates to us all, and Clement-Davies' does it in a way we can all relate to. Check out this book or you'll be missing something."
5,Great read for even science fi haters,After I read this I just loved it. The twists and turns catch you by surprise. I gave it to my mom to read who was very reluctant but agreed that she would read it. After she read it she was recommending it to all of her friends. It was a wonderful read and unique since it is written from a wolfs point of view.
2,Juvenile and predictable,"I borrowed this book from a lending library at work. Thankfully I didn't buy it; I would have been sorely disappointed. What promised to be interesting at first look quickly proved an inept attempt at a supernatural epic. The wolves' theology is so reminiscent of Christianity as to be just one step above plagiarized. I would expect a being supposedly sentient and with such developed theologies, beliefs and self awareness to be more eloquent. Dialog was juvenile at best. I would not recommend this book to any serious fantasy epic reader."
2,Really Really Morbid,"I read Firebringer by this author and I really liked it. So I decided to read this book. It was okay in the beginning, but I reached the halfway point approximately seven characters had died. Maybe I'm the only reviewer to have a problem with that, but also it sounds really cliched, we've seen all these animal stories before, written better and in fewer pages. The important elements we've all seen before and the plot beginning was unoriginal. I could predict the whole book. It got in to some interesting character study, but then it just signed the bad guys off as evil, even after showing that they had been wronged in the first place. Maybe if you are not quite as critical as I am you will like the book. I just didn't.And I'm sorry so few people found my review helpful...I just could not finish the book. If fewer of them had died..."
2,some projects have faulty directions,"it's unfortunate that for some project, teddy bear for example,the instructions are incorrect. There is no way to follow them.Is this meant for the beginner? Don't think so."
1,not for begginers AT ALL,my mom bought me this kit as a birthday present and I was excited to finally learn how to crochet but this book IS NOT for begginers. It has fancy abbreviations for every step and you literally have to sit there and translate every line before you begin.
4,great buy,this is a nice size board and good quality for the price. the board is sturdy and great for travel.
1,my Fry pan can only use for 3 months,"I brought this Fry Pan because of its look and its price. I brought it at Target and from the price. I thought it can last longer. It looks beautiful with stainless steel outside. However, I can only use this Fry Pan for 3 months. The side shows peel off everywhere. I already not put hard stuff like rib to cook but it still peel off. I was so disappointed with this Fry Pan. I don't recommend it to everyone."
2,Retun as soon as possible,"The product could have authenatic photographs just like the 1949 book had. Also in some of the pages, the printed words look like they were starting to disappear book which means you were going to be looking a blank pages down the road."
4,a must-have for AVG buffs,"I'm delighted that this book is back in print, even if at a high price. Chennault's ""autobiography"" was written in 1949 just as the Chinese Nationalist government and his airline were starting life anew on Taiwan. The text was written by Robert Hotz, with the chapters okayed by the Old Man. They express his views fairly, but Hotz did not have all the documents available to him, and Chennault was too busy to fill in the details. Still, you get the flavor, and it's eminently worth reading and owning."
1,Very Disappointed,"I had been a fan of Mary McCarthy since high school and therefore was excited when this book came out. I ordered it as soon as it was available but still have not finished it. The text is jumpy and jerky and definitely not presented in an organized, smooth manner. Biographical information is interesting but then is supported by repetitive gossip or other information that interupts one's train of thought. I would have not purchased this book if I had previewed it first. I believe that I wasted my money on this one."
1,DO NOT READ!,"This book is well written, documented. I have no issue with the author and respect his labor. The ""star"" of this book should not be glorified. Many people have endured such hardship for noble reasons and or accidental mishap. These two con men are not those. Should have been titled ""Grafters on Ice"". The saddest fact is in the end he cons his own family members into a voyage where they can ""learn to starve"" correctly , or some such non sense. They all died. This is not courageous. I read over 30 books this past winter. I gained something from each book. Not this one. I wish I had not read it."
1,Design flaw,"Absolutely the worst (and really, only bad) aspect of an Aeron chair. My third pillow just broke, completely torn in half. Luckily the chair comes with a great warranty that includes the pillow so I've not had to pay for a replacement so far, but it's a little ridiculous."
5,Great deal,"With the holidays fast approaching, I was on the look out for some baking helps. I saw these cooling racks and the size, price and availaibility were perfect."
4,Good Cooling Rack,"The size is a little awkward. It's too big to cool one 8-9 inch cake but too small for 2 of them(side-by-side). I just wished it was a little wider and longer in lenght but for the price of $6.99, I guess I shouldn't complain."
1,RUST!!!,"Too bad Amazon doesn't offer negative stars!I was with T. Miller (1st review) in thinking:How can you go wrong with a cooling rack?Well...............I purchased the racks 9 June 2008 and all was great.Wonderful...for the first few monthsNow even though I hand wash and dry these they are rusted at all of the grid's cross points.I've tried contacting Baker's Edge CS to no avail.So...........I'm returning to my tried and true: Wilton ( I have Wilton cake pans that are almost 30 years old and still going strong)So, use our experiences and buy another set of cooling racks** BTW, these work well for their intended purpose but I prefer my foods sans rust"
4,Decent rack but handwash & dry only,"It'll rust if you run it through the dishwasher. These are nice, heavyweight racks, though I suppose there's not a lot to be gained with a good quality rack cooling rack..."
5,Puppy barrier,"We purchased this gate prior to our new puppy coming home. We wanted to keep her off the carpet as much as possible. This has worked great, easy to step over and easily configured for different openings."
5,Just what I needed,I bought the large freestanding gate earlier this summer in order to block off a large opening between my kitchen and family room. It's easy to step over and to move out of the way. My puppy has learned to stay behind the gate and doesn't even attempt to go over it even though he could. I was a bit disappointed to see the current price on Amazon. I bought it from Amazon for around 99 dollars. It looks as though the price has gone up quite a bit. I think this must be a popular item right now with pet owners. I have seen it at Coscto online recently for 89! Deal or no deal this is the gate to get.
3,Smart dogs will defeat this gate!,"We purchased this for our two shelties, age 14 weeks and 2 years. We have a wide opening to block so the size is great. My only complaint, however, is that a smart resourceful dog will figure out how to move this. It only took my 2 year old sheltie 5 minutes. He would simply stick his nose in between the bars & nudge it out of the way. We found a way to secure it so he couldn't move it but it may be only a matter of time. Once our puppy is housetrained, the gate will be history. Well made though and the price was the best I could find for this gate."
1,Yorkies can move it!,"I don't know what this gate could possibly be used for. Probably for falling on your face when you step over it. That's what we did! My grandma owns this gate, and still *tries* to use it. Before we moved out of her house, we had all tripped trying to step over it at least one, and my not-even-one year-old was pushing it around. My grandma has 3 Yorkies, they all weigh 5-6 lbs. One can jump over this gate, and another can push it open."
5,High Quality Gate!! I LOVE IT!!!,"This gate is a Premium pet product. It is everything advertised. It is very study, looks good and free standing. It takes a little assembly but well worth it. You only need a screw driver. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
3,nice but not tall enough,"I raise small dogs, so I am surprised that anyone finds this height to be enough to contain their dogs, since mine just jump over it when they want to get to the other side. I wish they made this taller and with a gate for people to pass through so you don't have to move it or step over it each time you go from one room to another."
3,"Kirby, best Twin ever","The book is a very basic story of Kirby Puckett that leads much to be desired by the more mature fan. The book while a good read, seems to be written more for kids. As the other reviewer mentioned, a good read but for a better biography we will have to wait for Puckett to come out with his own later in life.The story of the man before his image was permanently tarnished. Brings you back to his simpler days when people smiled when you mentioned his name."
4,quite good!,"I first saw The Colour when they opened for OK Go, and they were amazing live. Their frontman is very energetic and all the band members were enthusiastic. It also helped that the songs were very catchy.This EP is quite good, but short. While the songs are still as catchy and good, they are much, much better live. ""Open Up The Boulevards"" is a great track."
3,Wrong size,"Unfortunately, the cup is the wrong size. It is too large. I have the classic green model Hamilton Beach Drinkmaster. I was offered that I could send it back, but I don't think the shipping price is worth it, so I'll just keep it.Fast delivery, but I ordered the wrong cup."
3,Cup Review,Cup is too tall to properly work with the mixer. The mixer stem will not reach the bottom like the cup that comes with the mixer. However the cup is very high quality and sturdy.
4,OEM quality,Essentially identical to the original. It fits our chili red Waring Pro mixer perfectly. No problems at all with frequent use and multiple washings.
4,Funny gross,"Splatterpunk God Edward Lee has won the tag line ""The Grossest Book You'll Read!"" for his novel ""The Bighead."" Forget ""not for the faint of heart"" and replace it with ""better have a strong stomach."" I'm embarrassed to say I laughed at something so completely depraved, since there is NOTHING sacred in this book, but it's so over the top it's down right funny at times. From the priest carrying on with the nympho prostitute and the 2 nuns with ""unusual"" fetishes he brings out of his dreams, to the hillbilly murderers who provide the most graphic scenes, to the Bighead, a hydrocephalic headed, never been washed, seven-foot tall, monstrosity who kills, maims and eats the brains of the locals, and the Luntville locals with secrets themselves, Lee hits them all. If you're looking for gross-out violence, hillbilly satire, sadistic sex, gore, and some great dialogue and characters, check out ""The Bighead."""
2,Where's his proof?,"Not once in his book does he tell ONE success story. He writes about several couples who were in the TRYING stages, but didn't share whether they ended up having a boy or a girl. I'm not sure how much stock I would put into this method... but I've not used it personally, so I guess I don't have a personal testimonial one way or the other."
5,"Earthfire, A Tale of Transformation","I was given this book as a gift. It was not only a great adventure story, but was thought provoking and inspirational. Once I started I couldn't stop. Would highly recommend."
2,Sangean DT-180 A/m-F/M/TV Band Receiver,"Attrative, compact, easy to use.Poor reception on some FM stations. My digital MP3 player, which fits into the change pocket of my slacks provides much better reception over entire AM/FM range."
1,Not what it seems,"Sangean is known for superior antenna reception, but not with this product. My purchase was to replace a wore out dt-300 thats 5 yrs of hard use. The dt-180 is just sub-par with the dt-300. It is 10% better than your basic consumer grade FM player. I returned this product and purchased the bigger, bulker dt-210, with better results."
1,shuts off automatically after 5 seconds and I cant get it to say on!,"initially I liked this little pocket radio, but after 6 month it started to turn off with in 5 seconds after I turned it on and there is no way I can figure out how to get it to stay on and play my station. I would give it back in a hot second if I still could. now I'm not sure if this is just a fluke with the specific radio that I got or is it an indication that this might be a wider problem with this specific model."
4,solid little radio,"This is a nicely designed little radio. I had no trouble tuning it or setting presets without reading the instructions.Sound quality is OK, but after years of listening to iPods and online streaming, a ""transistor radio"" is definitely a step down in fidelity and consistency. In particular, this radio is sensitive to where it's placed and how it's oriented in order to pick up the best signal.It's a good transistor radio, nicely designed, though it seems on the pricey side for a radio-quality listening experience. On the other hand, broadcast radio is FREE and everywhere, so you ought to have a radio!"
4,A Black and White Version Of Pride and Prejudice!,This is a good movie. Yes it has some flaws like the costumes being from the wrong time and looking like American outhern Civil War instead of Regency England costumes and looking like they used leftover costumes from Gone With The Wind and they took liberties by making Lady Catherine De Bourg into an old softy who actually liked and helped Lizzy but those are the only complaints I have and the acting by Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier is just magnificent and they had so much chemistry that made this smovie shine! I highly recommend this movie to fas of period costume films and to open-minded Jane Austen fans. If you watch this movie with a closed narrow mind and compare it to the versions that starred David Rintoul and Colin Firth then you will be disappoined but if you watch with an open mind and don't compare and allow yourself to enjoy then you won't be disappointed!
2,amusing but not true to jane austen,"i will credit this film with being amusing and entertaining, but if you are looking for a film that is more true to jane austen's work, this adaption is definantly not the one... it was most dissapointing when it came time for mr. darcy and ms. elizabeth to meet by chance at pemberley, and the film continued without the encounter... it left out the one point that, to me, made pride and prejudice, pride and prejudice.. (the point that mr. darcy laid aside his pride to win the women he loved, and ms. elizabeth let go of her preconcieved prejudices to accept the love that she realized she deeply longed for) this was an enjoyable adaption but my advice would have to be to spend a few more dollars on either of the 1985 or 1996 versions and enjoy a storyline that follows pride and prejudice as it was written by jane austen"
1,DVDs need to be properly secured.,"The item wasn't properly secured. When I received it the dvd was rattling around in it's container. I was afraid it was damaged, but fortunately it wasn't."
2,Just so-so,"Out of all the adaptations of this novel (and I've seen them all), this is probably my least favorite. First, it has all the nausiating over-dramatized acting that is so characteristic of old B&W movies (Betty Davis style prounounced eye-batting, and the like). The costumes were more of the style of antebellum pre-civial war America, rather than early 1800's Victorian England, with the poofy hoop skirts, and big bows. And I think the worst part, for me anyway, was the fact that this version completely changes the motives of Darcy's aunt for her battle with Elizabeth near the end of the movie. She did it to ensure that Elizabeth was sincear?? Give me a break. I know that most versions due take some liberties and make some changes, but this to me was just criminal, and was the last straw for me. I give it 2 stars because Olivier and Garson were both fine actors in their time, and should be given credit. but the movie as a whole, was just a complete dissapointment to me."
4,Wonderful.....,I love this film even though it does not stick strictly to the book. The only thing I hated was the costumes they looked like they were cast offs from gone with the wind. It was the first adaption I saw of my favorite book and was a thoroughly enjoyable romance.
5,Pride and Prejudice Original,Of course this was great and I really enjoyed it! This is one of those you can watch over and over.
4,Wonderful acting by the leads,"Garson and Olivier are wonderful, but if you're looking for a faithful adaption of the book, this isn't it."
1,Horrendous,"As an avid Jane Austen disciple I was horrified by this movie. It was as if the screenwriter had never heard of (let alone read) Austen's classic. The costumes alone made it quite difficult to watch- it is apparent that this film was hoping to ride the coattails of the epic Gone with the Wind with its Southern dresses and customs. And it only gets worse- Olivier (who I believe is a marvelous actor) transforms a prideful Darcy into yet another cowering suitor- a mistake that really defeats the point of the book. Basically, Austen's plotlines and themes were disregarded and I believe that any true Austen fan will agree with me on this. To end this review on a high note, I refer you all to a, in my opinion, five-star miniseries by the BBC that will truly satisfy your appetite for all things wonderful. It stars Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and it will truly be time well spent. You will definately not regret it."
4,Silly Pride,"I would label this the ""Silly Pride and Prejudice"" for while it is entertaining to watch, it is not nearly so romantic as some adaptations of this novel. Also, though Greer Garson is a credible actress she is too old to play Elizabeth.Overall this is an enjoyable adaptation so long as you are looking for an something that places more emphasis on the comedic aspects of the story than the romance."
3,Cute but leaks,"Bought this little watering can to water house plants and am reasonably happy with it.It has a cute design, but half the time when the spout is ""rotated"" it leaks water. This can generally be avoided by rotating the spout before adding any water. I never managed to get the little water distributor to work right for me. It seemed to slow the pouring rate too much and didn't ""sprinkle"" adequately, so I removed it.The can holds a good amount of water for watering watering just a few small potted plants, but if you have more than 4 or 5 plants, plan on getting a bigger can."
4,"Buy this,if only for the story State of Decay","Although I don't care for the other stories much, I must say that ""State of Decay"" may be the best Doctor Who episode EVER.The operatic atmosphere, coupled with the acting and cinematography, make this story a hallmark in science fiction. No other Sci-fi show except Doctor Who can get away with incorporating vampires into the show methology. A brilliant episode."
2,a big battery eater,"I had the earlier model of kodak camera and liked it. One thig about the kodak camera, they seems to produce high quality photo. We really like the picture. However, I am not happy about how fast we need to change the batteries. We can still use the used batteries for electric toothbrush (still enough power left for it), but not for the camera. The camera starts to shut off in a few seconds when the batteries do not have enough power for it anymore. It is very frustrating. We had suspected other defects, but as soon as we put the new batteries in it, it works fine. The older model went through a lot of baterries, too, but this one seems to be worse."
1,Awful Purchase From Wall Street Photo,The shutter does not open all the time and when I sent it back to Wall Street Photo they sent the same camera back to me again when I have asked for a refund....
2,Needs A Little Work,"I thought that the novel ""Goodbye Doesn't Mean Forever"" was ok. The main reason why I liked it was because my friend also died of Lukemia. Being in Jory's place however, I don't think that the author did a very good job establishing the characters. I know from personal experience what it's like to go through what Jory did, but I don't think it described her emotion very well at all. I didn't really have a chance to connect with the characters, and that to me, is what makes an exellent novel."
3,Track 13 Missing,"Track 13 ""Sands of Time"" is not listed.That's the best track on the CD yet it is not available.It is unclear what the customer receives if he/shedownloads the full CD version.Perhaps number 13 is just too unlucky."
3,"Pretty good, but not great","This cd is pretty good, but the rain mostly just sounds like white noise. It's still good to help me get to sleep, and I do use it several times a week."
3,OK but not the best.,"I love and I mean love Peanuts but I think the first 2 years were not the best. Charlie Brown and gang were so little. Snoopy didn't do anything. I really liked it once they put in Sally, Peppermint Patty and Marcie. I will get every book but I don't think I will get this one. However I guess 1952 is a little better because Lucy gets put in and she was really funny in the 1950s and I mean really funny. This book includes 78 comics from 1950, 313 from 1951, and 366 from 1952 for a total of 757 comics.I don't hate this book but I just think the others are better and who knows I might buy this book someday if I feel like it."
4,PYLE PDBT18 TWEETER,"I purchased these tweeters to replace my old, not working any more set in a pair of home built speakers and they sound great. The cost was very reasonable. And yes I also recieved one pair for my order. I do recomend this product for the quality, sound and price."
4,Engaging,"The book is presented in a format that makes it easy to read. Every chapter starts with the writings in the diary of a 15-year-old girl, followed by the arguments and problems in the relationship with her father as well as the private conversations between father and mother, and then by the meetings of the father with a teenage couch. It is insightful, although many of the ideas are common sense (but we parents sometimes forget). Here's the biggest problems that teenage children have with parents:1- Parents try to make decisions for them.2- They are too controlling.3- Overprotective.4- They try to live vicariously through them.5- Their love sometimes feels conditional.6- They have Unrealistic expectations (expect perfection).7- They project their own fears and insecurities on the children.8- Parents don't practice what they preach.Now the work as usual to listen more instead of simply lecturing, in a way that we don't fall into those 8 traps."
5,Blending faith and reason,"Bruce McDowell, a pastor at Tenth Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, blends research with Biblical insights and faith with reason to throw light on a most controversial event in human history, the Biblical flood. This approach of blending faith and reason, a hallmark of the teaching at Tenth, can challenge the discerning reader. The book is useful for private reading as well as a tool for group study.The Biblical exposition begins with humanity's descent (Genesis 6) and ends with the new beginnings (Genesis 9). Two themes run through the text, the faith of Noah, and the wrath and grace of God. An important message, pertinent today, is that evil can run its course only to a certain point, but there is a time when it will be dealt with. However, even as God executes His wrath, He makes provision for His Grace.The book is worth the buy for those desiring to understand the topic in some detail and/or to use as a resource for further research."
3,Adventure to the extreme,""" The Fifth Profession "" by David Morrell is a non stop page turner full of action and a twisting plot through out. The novel is about the adventure of two ""Ronin"" (bodygaurds) sworn to find the answer behind their nightmares. Savage is an ex American Navy Seal who is a professional bodyguard who takes high risk jobs. He specializes in security, hand to hand combat, and weaponrey. Akira who is also a Ronin is a brilliant Japaness who is a master of samuria and protection. Both men are subject to a shocking event when they meet for the first time on a job. Months later they suprisingly meet each other again and embark on a journey to find out what or who pulled them through hell and back. This book takes you from the streets of New York to Japan, this mystery is full of intrigue and great action. Thought you don't learn any morals from reading this book you learn alot about Japaness folklore and culture. A must read for any adventure/mystery reader."
2,Probably Morrell's worst,"I've read several of Morrell's books and have become quite a fan. While I've gradually given up the thriller novels, I still like to read Morrell for his clever plots and skilled writing. This book, however, was a severe disappointment. Sure, the plot was decent, if a bit more far-fetched than Morrell tends to be.My biggest problem was the dialogue. Morrell is too talented of a writer to let him off the hook for this. None of the dialogue is natural. Rather than describe things in the narrative, he uses the dialogue. It was painful to read.Check out Brotherhood of the Rose and Fraternity of the Stone, two of his best."
5,great read,"The Opening gets you hooked. As the plot unfolds, the reader has so many questions, it's amazing to think they're all going to eventually be answered. The end brings the answers, but a little too sudden, fast , and furious. Less development of the chase scenes and more clues to the ending would have made the climactic scene much easier (and more interesting) to discover."
4,Will Make You Say 'Wow',"Opening gets you hooked. As the plot unfolds, the reader has so many questions, it's amazing to think they're all going to eventually be answered. The end brings the answers, but a little too sudden, fast , and furious. Less development of the chase scenes and more clues to the ending would have made the climactic scene much easier (and more interesting) to discover. There are so many ideas and explanations thrown at you in the final few pages, it would have been great to have them hinted at earlier."
3,LaCrosse Atomic Clock,"We have other LaCrosse Atomic Clocks and they work great. But we're a little disappointed with this particular model. While it does have a large face and easy to read numbers, the hour hand doesn't quite point to the hour as it should....the hour hand stops about 2 dots before the hour when the minute hand points to 12. Also, this particular model doesn't allow to adjusting the hour hand, only the minute hand. We did compare this product with other atomic clocks online, but chose to stay with LaCross Technology because of our other atomic clocks."
1,Defective Product,"La Crosse Technology WT-3161BL 16 Inch Stainless Steel Atomic ClockDefective Product. Love the quality appearance and construction. Installed on wall easily. Time set quickly and properly and kept perfect time until ""fall back"" time 6 Nov. Clock set to new time properly and kept new time for about 12 hours, then the hour and minutes hands began to advance as if to reset time again. They are still advancing over the last 5+ hours. The same thing happened with my other La Crosse atomic clock. Likely some internal logic flaw."
2,Second hand fell off,"I had to repair this clock myself. The second hand fell off. Luckily, it was easy to disassemble and I was able to reattach the second hand. Apart from that it works as expected."
1,Broke after 3 weeks,"Beautiful clock, however after 2 weeks the time started spinning fast on its own. Reset the clock a few times to stop this. And now the second hand has stopped working. The minute and hour hands are still working for now...La Crosse quality has tanked..."
3,"Too many ""Cutter Error""'s!","The biggest flaw of this labeler is the ""cutter error"". It costs so much wasted time, not to mention the wasted tape.The print is high quality though, when it's working."
2,Overkill,"Although this product does make labels...it also makes labels in thousands of configurations, and designs...something no normal person should ever need. If you need a label maker for business this will suffice, but its way more than anyone needs for mere label making. I would guess this is the label maker they use at NASA..."
1,If I could leave less than 1 star I would...,"DO NOT BUY THIS LABELER. I used other p-touch labelers and they are great, but this one is not.Reasons:1. The device is not intuitive2. The documentation is hard to follow.3. It has a scammy tape wasting feature that makes you cut offand waste a 3/4"" piece of tape before every print job.4. The display yells at you. All messages on the display arein CAPS with an EXCLAMATION POINT!"
2,Libro,"Un poco lento, no lo recomiendo tanto, ya que a pesar de que es gratis, creo que hay mejores opciones"
2,Lesser Stuff,"I keep wanting to like Rick Bass so I gave this book a try. The title story was the best, but for me at least it is still marred by being difficult to take seriously at times, which is an even larger problem with the other stories. Perhaps more troublesome is the fact that Bass always seems to be trying too hard to make his stories ""life-affecting."" He wants to leave the reader somehow changed, and his stories do not quite get me there. Although often I suppose that I appreciate his effort to do so, I am too aware of it to fall under his spell."
3,CprE 486 Review,This book is very helpful in understanding object-oriented analysis and design. It is also very beneficial in understanding the concepts behind the unified process. It helps developers and students master the core principles and best practices of object-oriented analysis and design. I would recommend this book for use within a classroom environment and for reference in the workplace.
2,Examples are not good,This book is good overview for UML however examples given are too easy and not comprehensive enough to explain the subject.
4,Good textbook,"This book provides a great introduction to the general concepts of object oriented software design while hitting the important points of UML notation and the Unified Process. Larman clearly breaks down all of the OO design concepts and gives clear illustrations of how they are applied to the point-of-sale system, which is used throughout the book. He does a great job of showing how all of the concepts can be applied to a given project and how the various diagrams and ideas are tied together. This also allows for the reader to quickly identify the different purposes of each of the concepts.Although it was nice that Larman used one consistent example throughout the book, I would have preferred if he had used a different example than a point-of-sale system. I really lost interest in hearing about a POS system towards the end of the book."
4,Good if you are new to UML,"Larman does a decent job introducing UML and showing the reader what UML is good for. The book goes into some depth on the different types of class diagrams and shows how they can be useful. A great deal of the book is also spent on design patterns, but once again is better as a beginner book with general information about everything. This book is a great general resource on the subject, and also tells you where to look if you want more specific information in the future."
5,The best book to become a proficient software engineer,"The book is a perfect balance of UML diagrams and artifacts, and code. Larman guides through each step of gathering user requirements, analysis, design, and coding. The mapping of diagrams to the actual code is very impressive. Larman makes UML look so easy. Book follows one point-of-sale example and illustrates the development cycle step by step."
2,The worst book about UML and UP I've ever seen,"Absolutely useless book. For beginners it contains too many details, for professionals it doesn't contain anything interesting. It is clear that the author didn't ever take part in a real development of a real large project. Lost time, lost money."
5,Can not beat this for the money,"I am a 35 year power user of electric shavers, and many years of those with Remington microscreen shavers. My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable. I had had several rotary shavers which never really worked well for me. So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died. This shaver is almost as good as these past shavers, but much less expensive. Some disadvantages: The screen is not replaceable. But for most other shavers, a replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver. I use the same AA rechargeable batteries in it that I use in my digital camera, so batteries are never going to make the whole shaver unuseable. It does shave a little slower than a normal one. But for a backup shaver, travel, use in the car, etc, you will find it hard to beat."
4,It works!,"It isn't the best, but it doesn't cost nearly as much as the best either. I use this razor when traveling and at home when I don't feel like using a manual blade. This shaver has trouble with the neck area but I just clean it up with a blade if needed. This shaver is also very strong for a battery shaver... Maybe its because I always put freshly charged batteries in, but either way, its strong. I'm satisfied."
3,"Well written, but too many contradictions to the TV-series","The book is written in a language easily understood and with an exciting story. Unfortunately there are many contraditons to the action in the TV-series, fx:In the Tv-series, Michaela tells Colleen that she got her first kiss at the age of 25 - in the book she is 16.An important detail is that according to the book Michaela has known David her entire life, but in the TV-series she says that she met him at the hospital.And the circumstances surronding the death of her father are not similar either.If I had never seen the TV-series I'm sure I would have loved the book, but instead I spent a lot of time being annoyed about the details.If I only had to rate the story without knowing the TV-series I would have given it a 9."
5,Fabulous price guide,Kudos Jim Jenkins. I bought my husband the 2003 1/2 Roseville art guide. It was quite possibly the best purchace I have ever made in pricing pottery. My husband has saved a considerable amount of money using this price guide. AAAAA +++++
1,Haws watering can 5 liter,"The plastic doesn't hold up to Arizona sun. It falls apart, nice can if it was made out of better material."
5,watering can,"I love my new watering can it is easy to use and does the job it is made to do well worth the money , no stretching to water plants at the back of the green house , so very convenient !!"
1,Poor,"I was actually very dissapointed at the condition of the book. I realize I bought a used book, but I just thought it would be in better condition. I purchased this book because my house was flooded during hurricane Isaac and I lost this book in the flood. I've had this book since it came out in the 1970's and was devastated when I went back to my home to find this and many of my Elvis books on the floor soaked with water. And the condition of my book was SO much better than the one I've just purchased."
1,Too much money for a Kindle book,"I have the paper copy of this book. I've read and re-read it for years. I would like to have it on my Kindle and some of Wentworth's other books, too. But $9.99 is way too much money. When the publishers have decided to lower the cost, I might be interested."
4,Miss Silver Lends a Helping Hand,"William Smith has lost his memory, but he's quite sure that William Smith is not his real name, little does he know that he needs to regain his memory back as soon as possible or immediate danger will arise. With the help of Miss Silver, William sets out to find out who he is and why he's been having near-fatal accidents repeatedly.Great characters and story."
5,Dr Sankey Improves Acupuncture,Move into medicine of the past and future with acupuncture. Integrate energy medicine and chakra with meridians that move energy throughout the body. Blockages can be healed with Dr. Sankey's patterns of geometry.This book include the emotional component of energy medicine and past health problems can be corrected with the needle application for acupuncture in the book. Professional acupuncturists will love the books written by him. Go to a symposium and hear him speak.
4,Looks sharp,"Worked fine with Cali plates. I didn't have any of the alignment issues that another reviewer mentioned. Love the fact that it doesn't cover the plate at all, and looks much better than the cheap dealership frames that came with the car (I don't want to advertise for them anyway).The only thing to watch out for is that it extends outside of the plate a lot more than some frames, so make sure there's clearance on your car for that. It just barely fits on the back of my Charger, but not at all on the front."
2,Did not fit,This did not fit my VW GTI and not worth the hassle of returning it. I'm out $8 and have no frame.
1,"the toons are good,the transfers are the worst","this is a very poor collection and between the sound drops,picture skips and freeses this is one to avoid!!!! skip it!"
2,18/0 Stainless Steel is low quality,"The numbers 18/0, 18/8 and 8/10 give the percentage of content of chromium and nickel in the item. Stainless steel, must contain at least 11 % chromium, the above refer to 18% chromium. Stainless steel used in cookware is normally 18% chromium and 8% to 10% nickel.The chromium provides rust and corrosion resistance and durability. Nickel provides some additional rust resistance, hardness, and high polishing characteristics.Low end stainless steel cookware, mixing bowls, stockpots and accessories are usually 18/0 which are usually not highly polished, and could be subject to some rust spotting.This is low-end flatware and is not even listed anywhere on Oneida's website!Don't skimp on quality of your flatware. Features you could look for in decent flatware include: thick heat diffusing bottoms, 18/10 grades and a lifetime warranty."
1,Absolutely bad !,"There's no question that this flatware set is absolutely bad. The quality and finishing is so bad. Don't even think of buying this. I could not select less than 1 star, else I would given it a lesser rating."
1,Breaking all the rules,"It took a little while to recieve it and when I did, it was the wrong movie. I got Breaking the rules instead... Im still waiting for the right movie. I hope i will get a response soon and the right movie eventually cause its a classic old school movie."
5,Photoshop Elements 4.0 Classroom in a Book,"Excellent general overview of PSE 4.0. Orderly, step by step introduction to the features of Elements. It is a great place to start and allows the beginning Elements user to scratch the surface of a powerful program. It will whet the appetite to learn more and to play with the program in order to become more proficient with its many, many features."
5,Great product!,My dentist is very impressed with my use of the Oral B Power Tip. He says my gums and teeth look great. At my 6 month tooth cleaning there was hardly any plaque.
1,Should be called right and wrong!,"This book describes the war of metro ""relativism"" in the western hellenistic American culture. basically, its run by, for Greeks. and the Mid East knows it. As a Jew in reading this ""Roman guide to being lawless"". It is easy to see the ignorance of americans. John Kerry's ideas are in this book. - ""Lets mandate policy that causes people of faith in the middle east to hate us - with a PASSION, then we'll kill them off if they attack us for thinking we are the ""great satan""."" typical roman philosophy.- ""bully the world, it'll have to accept what and who we are, right or wrong."""
2,trademarking of stones,"I got this book because it was recommended to me by several friends and it is indeed a beautiful and informative book. However, I am totally disheartened and aggravated by the fact that Robert Simmons is trademarking stones. Is nothing sacred? For some reason, Monsanto comes to mind, and leaves me distrustful of his recommendations."
3,The Book of Stones review,"This book is a fantastic addition to any bookshelf, it not only contains the molecular constructs of each crystal but explains in depth, the metaphysical qualities in an easy to read format. The only thing negative that I can say, is that there are entries for man made stones, but even these are explained very well as to why they have a place within the pages. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in stones... NightSpirit"
4,Tons of info for you rock hounds,"Great pictures and tons of information on rocks and minerals. What they mean, colors, numbers they vibrate to and how to use them in shamanic ways. How to wear certain stone colors for health and spiritual reasons. This is an encyclopedia about rocks! This book is a keeper!"
4,Helpful and Huge,My friend owned this book and I was constantly borrowing it and finally decided to get my own. The book was much larger than my friends version but that was the only difference.
3,An index would have been good,"This book is very informative and the photos of the stones are beautiful. But it would have been so much more helpful and user-friendly if the authors had provided an index of the stones' properties instead of merely an alphabetical one. Still, overall I am happy with the book."
2,Good results when it works,"My first iron did not work straight out of the package...the light came on but no heat. Sent it back for a replacement. Second iron worked great. The larger size of the iron works well with my layered long hair. It gave it nice body (not actual curls), tamed the frizzies and the teflon kept the barrel from getting gunked up. But after about 3 months, something happened to the spring in the arm and it lost some of its pressure making it harder to keep my hair on the iron. It still worked just had to adjust how I rolled my hair to curl it. After another couple of weeks the thing stopped heating correctly. It just gets warm.Now after all the trouble I've had with this model, i'm considering purchasing a different brand. The size is perfect, too bad the iron isn't."
1,NOT PLEASED,"This item was NOT worth the cost. It is cheep and poorly made. I was getting this for my boyfriend as a fun gag joke, however, it was not worth the cost. The quality is horrible."
1,Moonsword,"Save your time and money and just read a story on Fictionmania. How this book got published is beyond me. The story line is full of holes and every page oozes amateurism. The lead up to the battle and the battle itself leaves you wishing you would have left this one on the shelf.As far as the ending, it's just an endorsment of the authors lifestyle.Please, don't waste your time. Really, it's bad."
5,Nice piece for the price,Very happy with the looks and size of the pendant. Looks expensive. Comes with a black fabric cord. Nice product.
5,As described,This shipped on time and is as described. Works with Warn products makes removing and installing a winch in different locations or vehicles a breeze. Bought it so my dad could run his winch off the rear of his CJ-5 if needed.
3,An Introduction that is not for beginners.,"I found Bob Berry's book informative, however, it assumes that the reader has had some experience or previous knowledge of carving and painting techniques."
3,Dangerous Mission (Spain PAL Region 2),"Nice, full screen edition of this compact RKO Classic originally released theatrically in 3D. Fairly sharp video that changes from scene to scene. Adequate mono sound. I was not able to eliminate the Spanish subtitles. If anybody out there (The CinemaScope Cat) knows how to do it please advise me. Thanks.(Paul Casale)vladfive2001@yahoo.comDangerous Mission ( Rangers of the North ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain]"
2,The wrong side of average,"Stelvio Massi's Convoy Busters aka An Inconvenient Cop is a meandering affair that ticks boxes without much enthusiasm without ever really holding together and often feeling like three different rough treatments for a cop at odds with the system movie that got awkwardly combined in the hope that something would stick. It's watchable enough if you've nothing better to do, but apart from an amusing early warning signal for arms smugglers (a local TV channel pulling its striptease show for technical reasons and replacing it with an old movie!) there's not much in the way of imagination on display. The wrong side of average.As if to compensate for the film, NoShame have gone all out on the extras with several inhterview featurettes, stills and poster gallery, trailer and even a comic book!"
1,Boring!,I believe the writer himself had become bored with his own writing when writing this book. I would reccommend it to my worse enemy.
5,Great beginning to a wonderful series!!,What a touching story! The fact that this series is based upon actual events makes you believe that love can conquer all. Kudos to Ms. Stokes and her family for letting their story be told in such a wonderful way! Thanks!!! DON'T miss the other two books in this series.
4,Superb but very underrated.,"After recording three beautiful but poorly promoted CDs for Motown, Gerald moved on to Street Life/Scotti Bros. but he (sadly) fared no better commercially and issued just one CD there. ""Tell Me"", ""Stay The Night"", ""I'm Going Crazy"", ""Mirror Mirror"" and a remake of the classic hit ""Kiss And Say Goodbye"" all make this CD worthwhile but 1990's ""Open Invitation"" and 1992's ""Always In The Mood"" contain stronger material and production. Just why this great Soul balladeer never got his due recognition and respect as a solo artist (when many less-talented artists whom he competed against for airplay topped the charts) is beyond me but his willingness to keep on making real music is admirable."
2,Poor cd player,"This cd player has good audio quality, but it uses batteries up very fast. It also does not have a single track automatic playback feature."
2,Not what I'd recommend,"I've spend decades hiking and backpacking with my dogs in parks and wilderness areas across the country. My first trips were made with a mutt I had in the 70's, now I hike with a pack of three purebreds who range in age from 10 years to 8 months.I've read most of what's out there on hiking with your dog. This book was unremarkable largely because it was so poorly organized and prepared. There isn't any new or particularly insightful information included - and I suspect it is a vanity press edition as I was distressed at the large number of spelling and grammatical errors in the book. Gary my friend, that's the Monks of New Skete, (skeets are what we shoot!)Hiking and backpacking with your dogs is a wonderful way to bond with them but I suggest you find a different book to guide your way."
1,Perplexed,WE followed all the installation guidelines and the software loaded properly but we cannot open it to play it. We would like any input as to how to get this to play for us.Thank you for any help you can give on this matter
3,"Great game, problems with performance","The kids and I :) love this game, but it freezes for 8-10 seconds at least once a minute on my 1.6 GHz P4 running Windows XP. My computer greatly exceeds the system requirements printed on the box. This really detracts from the game and the kids are not as patient as myself."
4,"Great Game, Poorly Documented","First of all, let me say that this is a great game. It's loads of fun for the whole family to play, and it runs smoothly on even my older Mac G4.That said. My whole family was stumped about what to do when plugging cords into machines in the game. If you've run out of plugs, the other end of the cord just floats there, and you cannot continue the game! Nowhere in the manual does it mention that you can give up on a cord by pressing the 'ESC' key. I suppose that's a good key to choose, and it makes sense, but they simply forgot to mention it in the manual, and we wasted a whole day trying to play the game and getting stuck over and over."
5,Super Fun!,"This is an awesome, good, clean game that will provide hours and hours of entertainment. Remember Rube Goldberg? You can build Rube Goldberg-esque machines and put them into motion. You can also ""solve"" puzzles by figuring out what things to put where to make your crazy machine do something - like lighting a candle or launching a rocket.Our kids also like to work together and also with their friends - not always something we see when they play on the computer - so it's great for families and friends to play all together. I like the way the people who made this smuggled the physics in there with the fun. How nice to see intelligence combined with real fun.(We got this for our kids but we are having fun with it too.)"
2,"Fun at First, but Later Tiresome","I enjoyed the uniqueness of this game for a short while, but then it became tiresome. I can see how some people would enjoy it endlessly, but just not my thing. Putting together various thing-a-ma-jigs to make a ball roll into a basket or to make lights blink is not my idea of endless fun. After finally finding the solutions in the separate file on the disk, it was tempting to just look at the solution after minimal efforts, thus spoiling the fun. Someone more persistent than I, might not have a problem with this."
2,crazy machines,"The concept of this game is good, but we found there is no help, clues, tips, or anything to get you started. My eight year old played four rounds before he got stuck. He isn't sure what to move on the game and there is nowhere he can get help. He hasn't played it since. It's a good game, but would be better if there were some type of instructions included."
4,Crazy Machines,A fun game with some learning for a younger audience. This game really makes you think until it hurts.
3,A Challenge,"I ordered this game for my 8 yr. old grandson at my daughter's request. She reports that he enjoys playing it most of the time but it is not by any means intuitive, so it's quite a challenge at times -- even for my 42 yr. old son-in-law who is a very intelligent man!"
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this and can't get it to run. Their tech support doesn't email you back. The web site says it requires special sound and video cards to work. I downloaded all the drivers and patches recommended on the web site but it doesn't run at all. Many other customers have had similar complaints if you read through this list. If it works I'm told its great, if not, too bad."
3,"Very good, but has problems.","We bought this for our seven year old son. He has enjoyed it greatly and seeing how creative he can be with problem solving in this game, I have to declare this was money well spent. Why only 3 stars? First because it won't work on my son's computer and after a week I got a terse reply from support saying it won't work on my video card. It worked find on my laptop (but now I have to share, but that's another story.) Also, it is sometimes hard to figure out how to use some of the parts or what exactly they want you to accomplish. Better objectives would be nice. At least they give you an answer key but that is in a PDF document where it is time consuming to find the experiment you are on.All in all, a pretty engaging 'game', but be prepared for some technical troubleshooting."
1,Avoid it for Macintosh,"Bought this for my iMac core duo machine so my granddaughter could play it. It will start up, but then does nothing. Loaded it to another iMac with same results. CHecked their website for support and find there is none. No discussion groups. No FAQs covering issues. THen noticed that this software is several years old. No recent updates or bug fixes. All the publisher wants you to do is send them an email.Looks to be a real cute fun piece of software, but not for more modern machines and OS's.Look for something else."
2,Cupcake Decor/Party Favor,"I haven't thrown the party yet, but I've reviewed the product and find that the painting on them isn't perfect, but the major problem I see if that the size of the ring is much too large for a child. It fits my wedding finger probably better then my wedding band! LOL. But if you want George themed party favors/decor they will work! Just be aware that your child will not be able to wear the rings, as they are too big, and the painting is subpar."
3,It's ok,"I have ordered most of the rubs from Steven. This one is ok, some of the others i just don't like at all.Everyone has their own tastes and you will never know if you will like it until you try it.read the label carefully, it states that this is very strong stuff, and i would agree. Use sparingly.."
1,Ink,"The ink cartridge in the machine was completely dried up. This rendered the machine useless for copying, printing, or resceiving faxes. This is the only amazon product I am dissatisfied with. The product is so old, even though it is in good shape, that if you order a new ink cartridge it has set on the shelf for so long it is dried up too.i bought it for all it's uses so it is a waste of my money. I'm very dissatisfied whit it. Willie Anderson"
2,"It works, but keep the manual handy","I only own this because my wife owns a business. It gets used once or twice a quarter and is a pain in the butt every time. Eventually it works but if I have any choice in the matter I'll never own another fax machine.Two issues I've had recently:1) A paper jam with no paper in the machine, anywhere. I not sure what cleared it but the last thing I did was push the stop button repeatedly six or seven times. I didn't want to power it off as there was a fax in memory.2) Wouldn't print the fax in memory, just spun for a while and then said ""add paper"". There were 10-15 sheets in there but apparently it can't reach those. I added another 20 or so and it worked."
2,"Passable for the price, I suppose","I confess I don't think much of fax machines in general; they're painfully antiquated and I don't have much confidence in my transmissions -- but I'll try to separate that out from my review.My wife needed a fax for her online retail business -- they're still a simple fact of life. This was the cheapest I could find given the rebate.I ran out of ink quicker than I expected. There is no power switch and there doesn't seem to be a pass-through for the regular phone; I guess it's meant for a dedicated line. This necessitates a lot of cable-plugging when it's time to use it.At one point, after about 5 months, it begun spinning its rollers and complaining of a nonexistent paper jam. After finding that there were no nearby service centers I was going to give up and find a new machine, but I found a FAQ on the Sharp site advising that I turn it on while holding down the Stop and Go keys, which worked."
2,Got a problem here,I purchased the fax machine on the internet for the purpose of making it my personal fax machine for home use. I have internet phone service and it seems that this fax machine doesn't do too well in the digital world. Tech support told me that sometimes it will work and sometimes not! Nowhere in the sales process was I informed about this little problem. Not even in the packaging that came with the machine. Not a happy guy.
4,"So far, so good","This fax machine has not been around long enough for me to give a really full assessment. However, I thought setup was a snap, the menus are easy to access and follow, AND it feeds pages better when faxing more than one sheet in comparison to a fax machine four times the cost! This is a nice, basic fax machine."
3,How Did I Get Here?,"The Talking Heads' song ONCE IN A LIFETIME comes to mind while reading ROCKVILLE PIKE. Janie is not quite sure how she came to be living in a huge house, working at her husband's family store, and trying to connect with her increasingly distant husband. In addition to the humor and pathos in this tale, there's an odd sense of menace. Who is Delia underneath her makeup and flirty clothes? What is Tracy, the lawyer/scrapbooking consultant, really up to? Where did those old bones found under the store come from? Characters and conflicts come and go, many not really explored or resolved, which is a bit frustrating; there are actually about three potential novels that could come out of ROCKVILLE PIKE. Overall,however, Janie is quite likeable and you want to keep reading in the hope that everything will turn out for her."
2,disappointing effort,"Having read about the skills of this wonderful musician I was very excited to get my hands on a copy of this book.However, I was disappointed when it arrived.I found nothing inspiring or indeed any more informative than your average ""How to..."" manual.I felt that many pages of this book were merely lists I could find free on the internet and the 10 pages of programmes from her recitals seemed a little bit on the cheeky side.I returned this book"
2,Advertisements for myself,"There's some genuinely useful information in this book, no doubt about it. And it's worth a read for the guitar enthusiast. She's one of the best and knows her stuff. But my goodness, taking up almost a fifth of a book at the end with her reviews, schedules, concert programs, et. al.! It's shameless. One feels they're paying for Sharon Isbin to advertise."
4,Awsome!,"I didnt really have any references for this dock, i just needed one to charge up my controllers at the same time, and i have to say the look and feel of this product is really neat. Definetly would recomend!"
5,two birds in one shot,"we keep all handles and earpiece charge all the time, I did buy two of them price was reasonable and dont take to much space"
5,Love it,My husband loooooooooves this charger thingy. He wanted one for so long and I found this one. He likes the set up better than any of the others and it shipped fast as well.
2,Not worth the time or effor,Too good to be true!! Saw the price of under 7.00 for this charger and thought we would give it a go. Was small which made it nice so id didnt take up much room. The way it is made it is hard to get the controllers plugged in just the right way t omake sure they get a good charge. I have a 9 year old and a 11 year old and both of them would have a hard time getting them plugged in right so they would charge. I say spend they extra money and get a better easier charger. This one is going back!!
1,broken and not working,It came broken and not working.And the package arrived delayed.is a waste of money.koihfoifqwiuhfiugqiuf dsgsdggsdd sdgsdgdg<d dGGg
4,PS3 controller charging station,This charging station works great. Does what it's suppose to do and is compact enough to put just about anywhere. Great item!
3,Charging Station,It did not come with a standalone charger You must plug this in via usb to charge. Other then that its nice.
2,Arrived broken,"The device its self was fine. It didn't come with cord, but who doesn't have a bunch of those around. It does plug in to the PS3. My biggest complaint was one of the support bars that hold the controller in place was broke off. Nothing a little glue couldn't fix, but still, brand new in a box and broke?Oh well, we will be fine."
1,Don't get it!,"Absolutely awful! It ruined my controller! I don't know how it happened but now it doesn't charge, If you need a charging system, don't get this one for sure."
1,Cheaply made,I was very disappointed when I open the package & it was broken in one spot. I realized that the plastic rest was really cheap silver looking junk. Whe I picked it up (I wrap presents on the floor) it broke completely off. This charging station would not last the first use with my children. I will be returning it. It is too bad because the design of it is neat. you can easily charge 2 controllers at once. If it was made of better stuff it would be great. I plan on looking for another at Best Buy in the mall so I know what I'm getting.
1,Warantee -Forget parts department,"Owned TV for 2 months i yr warantee. Remote broke (always had trouble with it) Called and was helped after 45 min wait - they gave me case # and said I needed to call parts department to order - NO SUCH PLACE. They gave me a fax #. I have been calling assistance every day since. I just put my phone on speaker, call number and wait. After 1/2 to an hour they will answer and say they will transfer me to parts - Then phone goes dead - this been going on for 4 days. I tried emails - my email to parts was sent back - saying they changed how to email them - tried new email address and it does not work due to my security level - I took off security - still does not work. Try before you buy - Viewsonic assistance 1-800-688-6688. Good luck"
3,Not extremely impressed...,"A note at the end of the story explained where Austen had left off and ""Another Lady"" began (she begins in chapter 11, after ""Poor Mr. Hollis..."") At first, I thought the transition was nearly seamless, but, as the story wore on, the author's style became increasingly distinct from Austen's. Of course, I must say that the author did a fairly well job - we all know that Austen posseses that special something that cannot be exactly copied by anyone. Overall, the story was charming and several of the characters were some favorites of mine, but the author couldn't quite catch Austen's way with words."
4,"good, not great",I'm one of those parents who likes to know what their kid is reading so i read most of the books given my kids as gifts. this particular book held the interest of the kids and seemed to be a real page turner so i checked it out. and i enjoyed it as well.For what it aspires to be the book is well done and interesting. Recommended.
2,tongue and cheeky,"The best stuff on his previous album is heartfelt, beachy and mixed with some reggae. He then went tongue and cheeky and backyard bar-b-que on us and it did not turn out well. Don't download the EPs following this (a couple of gems on there) but he gets back on track with Kingdom Come and Diego's Diary. Buy those."
1,BUYER BEWARE,The table was delivered with a defective part. I attempted to mail in a request for a replacement and it was denied. It has been a huge hassle and I would not suggest this product to anyone.
1,ARRRGH!!!,"what a frustration this purchase has been from beginning to end. my husband and i purchased the whole set. we received the table broken in half (glass and all) and had to send it back, then we got the end table and there were absolutely no holes in it to put it together. my husband and i drilled the holes and made it work. the taller end table had a giant scratch in the glass and it wobbles badly. definetly more hassle than tey are worth. i guess thats what we get for purchasing cheaply produced products from 3rd world nations. next time (which wont be too long from now, considering the cheapness of the product) we are buying american made."
2,Damaged on Arrival,"I purchased this table for my RV to go between two recliners. It is a cute table, but arrived damaged. The finish was rubbed off on a portion of the table rim. Also, the bottom shelf was cracked. My husband put the table together before I noticed the damage. Since I didn't want to go through the hassle of disassembly and paying postage to return it, I was able to sand and stain the rubbed off area so that it's not noticeable, and I will glue the crack in the shelf. If I were going to use this in my living room I would definitely return it, however. So, although it is just the right size and shape for my space, the condition it arrived in was barely acceptable. The box was intact, so the package was probably packed with damaged pieces. This does not speak well for Winsome Wood's quality control. I won't be purchasing any other products from them."
5,"Easy to assembly, nice piece",This is a sturdy piece that was easy to assemble and looks really nice in my bedroom as a side table in a reading nook!!
4,Nice table,We purchased these end tables along with the coffee table for my wife who wanted a dark set to replace our existing tables. As we really never use the living room we didn't want to over spend on tables. We saw these and thought why not give them a try. I have ordered before from Amazon and was completely satisfied with there service. Just make sure it being shipped from Amazon and not a third party seller.The tables arrived in a few days and were very easy to put together using the supplied twist fasteners. I liked them so much I (not my wife) ordered the matching taller display table.We are very happy with the purchase and the price.
4,Great little table for the price!,"I got two of these tables yesterday, less than a week after I submitted my order. The first one was a little difficult to assemble- as a previous reviewer who purchased this piece noted, we too had some trouble lining one of the legs with the pre-drilled screw holes. To those who experience the same problem: it's much easier to position them properly with two people. With my help, my husband was able to get all the legs screwed to the base properly. The second table was a breeze to assemble- probably because we knew how we needed to position the legs. The finished product is a really handsome little end table! My only complaint is that the glass piece could fit a bit more snugly in the center. But hardly noticeable unless you are cleaning it."
4,Espresso end tables,"These tables (I bought 2) came in a timely manner and were easy to assemble. They are simple yet classy, and I liked them so much that I also bought the ladder shelf. Two thumbs up!"
3,Small,Tables are pretty but smaller than what I thought they would be. Then they went on sale after I had ordered them. Had to do some adjusting to fit the glass piece into the hole.
1,what buyers want,"Thankyou Ian Vance for your insightful yet arduous reveiw.I'm sure there are a few people out there that will be curious enough to read it.If you did not notice it is a reveiw on the audio CD, not the game or its release.No doubt you know what you're talking about, but as a interested buyer with a limited spare time, I want to know what you thought of the CD, what it lacks and a short and sweet reveiw that tells me what I want to know. Remember in the future to keep the consumer happy and not to spiral into too much detail.Although thankyou to xperfectdarknessxx for telling me that it did not contain Jade from Sweetbox. That my friendly shoppers is something you might wanna know.Therefore I did not purchase it, so do not pay any attention to my rating.Final Fantasy...the only good reason to spend day after day glued to the box."
2,Great Concept; if you have duct tape,"Ever since my dog ripped out my sliding screen door I have been looking for an easy replacement. This seemed to be it, for a while. I liked the screen but the fastening system uses velcro strips with adhesive on the back to stick to the door jamb. I thought the velcro wouldn't stick to my door but it was the other way around, the velcro didn't stay on the screen. The glue holding the screen to the velcro did not hold and left me with both halves of the velcro stuck to my opening and the screen on the ground. Now I did say it was a great concept, maybe I just had one with a bad batch of velcro. One other good thing, my dogs could run thru it."
5,Hooked on the Show,Hooked on the show. Now hooked on the books! A friend bought me the first two of this series of books which lead me to purchase Vol. 3!
4,"Good, but not as good as the first two","OK, so I must agree with some other reviewers that Rick and Lori's characters seemed less believable in the comic. I like the way they handled the prisoners and the taking of the prison better in The Walking Dead series on AMC. However, it was a good read, with nice development of some characters, and a nice cliffhanger on the last page."
4,A thrilling book,"Aliens Ate My Homework is an adventurous book about a young boy named Rod who meets six aliens after they crash into his house. After Rod introduces himself to the aliens, they ask for his help in capturing an intergalactic criminal called BKR. At the same time he has to keep them a secret from ""earthlings"" and BKR. At the end of the story, the aliens capture BKR and take him to stand trail on Alpha Centari!"
1,Beware! Use without guard = injury!!!,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. I recommend that you NEVER trim without the guard, especially inside the bikini line. This trimmer 'bites' sensitive areas and will cause bleeding/pain. The shaver attachment only works with stubble, nothing longer than 1/16th of an inch. Even with stubble it takes too many passes to completely shave areas."
1,Is this a joke?,"This presentation is truly garbage. Amateur production, no real Beatles content, no music, mostly useless footage and commentary about dime-store Beatles trinkets. Even more boring: The two ""moderators"" look and act like refugees from a low-rent 1970's night club act. Overall, this DVD is insulting to the Beatles' legend, to the viewers' intelligence and to the plastic it's burned on. Save your money."
1,The Gears Are Just For Show,"Not only does the clock not work and grinds very loudly, but what I thought would be a great conversation piece for my husband at work who is an engineer, is not even really made of gears. All of the gears are plastic pieces that just turn without touching each other.The packaging didn't even include a slip, receipt, or instructions for how to return it."
4,Strangely Adicting....,"At first the Futureheads, didn't appear to be that great of a band to me, but after listening to the songs a few times it grew on me. Starting with ""Decent Days and Nights,"" then slowly and steadily the other songs started to have some appeal. Its strangely adicting, it doesn't hit you at first but when it does its amazing. The Futureheads have a great sound that just needs a pushing start to gain some momentum."
4,Early XTC remixed but memorable,"The first time I listened to this I was wondering why so many people had reviewed it so highly. Jangling noisy punk with no clear direction or meaning. The second time I had my ear re-tuned to early XTC and said Aha! The songs are really songs not noise and very catchy ones at that. I expect a few more spins and I'll be totally hooked, just like I was with XTC. I wish Andy would pull his finger out and prduce some legitimate XTC work instead of offcuts and doodles."
1,Rubbish,"The biggest pile of over hyped do do ever. Don't waste your money I have deleted it from my iPod and honestly feel like selling it on eBay. But then again I don't think people are mug enough to buy this. They remind me of an Indie version of the Flying Pickets and that is definitely not a good thing. Avoid like the plague, do not get caught up in the hype."
4,Enlightening look at the lives of NBA players,"In his book, Platt reveals some of what goes on behind the headlines. If anything, it makes us think twice about what the league, management and media types say about the people who actually play the game. While they are paid professionals, Platt shows us how little their pre-NBA experiences prepare the players for the big time and all that fame brings them.The language used in the book - while rough - only adds to the impact of what the players themselves have to say about what is happening. If anything, language is obviously used as a weapon (esp. in Charles Barkley's case). You really have to think more about the message's intent rather than how it's expressed.Great book - highly recommended to all those starry-eyed wannabes who think they have the right stuff."
5,One of the best,"I had this book laying around for 2 years before I decided to actually begin reading it. It just didn't seem like my type of book, but when I started reading it, I couldnt stop. Cleo's character is very lovable. I had just gotten done reading a JAK book before this one that was not very good, so I was hoping to come across a novel by her that I would enjoy. Well, I've found it! This book is packed with love, humor, suspense, and anything else that makes up a good novel. Do yourself a favor and check it out!"
4,Great book for the beginner psiconaut,"Overall good, but there are some parts extremenly technic and difficult to understand.8.5 of 10"
1,BUYER BE WARE!,"These cartoons have not been ""lovingly restored"". The video and audio quality is terrible. Also, not all of these cartoons are from Van Beuren Studios; two cartoons from UB Iwerks' Celebrity Productions have been snuck onto this DVD.If you are looking for UB Iwerks cartoons, check out the ""Cartoons That Time Forgot - The Ub Iwerks Collection, vol. 1"" and ""Cartoons That Time Forgot - The Ub Iwerks Collection 2, vol. 2"". While not pristine, these are MUCH better quality and there are over 3 hours of cartoons on each DVD.While it is nice to see some of the older, lesser-know studios get a DVD collection, I can't recommend this one. Hopefully someone will take the time to do the Van Beuren Studios the justice they deserve."
1,should have stayed lost,"this poor excuse of a collection is very poor transfer and sound wise,plus as my kids say ""these movies are no good""!!!!! i rest my case!"
2,Passable for complete beginners,"The GeekSquad has been around for years. They originated in the Twin Cities with a gimmick - suits and cool cars. Apparently they've fixed the computers of celebrities (ooh). When I was still living in the Twin Cities, however, my experience was that with any computer problem that required more than basic skills to fix, the GeekSquad was sorely lacking. Many problems went undiagnosed through several GeekSquad visits, though they will happily take your money anyway. If only for this reason, I'm a bit loathe to trust any book that they happen to have written. If you really want to get hands-on with learning and repairing PC's, don't bother with this book. Better books are ones like Scott Mueller's ""Upgrading and Repairing PC's"", as well as anything from O'Reilly."
1,Geek Squad is a HOAX,"I saw that Geek Squad car running around town here in Mpls., so when I had a problem with my laptop, I thought I would give them a call. Well, three visits later, my laptop is still broken but I'm a couple hundred bucks poorer.I hope the guys who wrote the book aren't the guys who actually come out and do the work, because the technicians they sent didn't seem to know much more than what was in the manual already. This ""Geek Squad"" seems to be a lot of marketing hype with very little value to back it up."
4,Good Video,"This is a good video especially if you're pressed for time or don't feel like putting forth the energy for an extended work out. It begins with a short aerobic segment that gets your heart pumping. The leg and bun work is great however, the upper body ""push-up"" is negligable. The ab work out is basic but challenging because it is continuous. I really like the music in this one."
4,A Good Fit,"I bought this for my fiance a few months back. We're not much of ""designer"" shoppers, especially when it comes to t-shirts. But for $15 it was worth the buy.The good thing is that these shirts fit really well. My fiance has a tough time finding clothes that are small enough to fit but I guess since designer stuff is usually made on the smaller side these fit very well. From well I hear from my fiance the material is good as well, though it's thin. The white shirt is pretty much see-through so you can only wear it as an undershirt. Unless you're into the whole see-through clothing thing...All in all, it's not THAT special unless your looking for smaller clothes that fit well. But it's kind of a novelty to have something by ""Versace."""
4,Fun but not too much substance there,"My only complaint about this dvd is that it really doesn't have very much substance to it. It is just a fun travel dvd with only backgrounds on very few places. If you are looking for an in depth look at France and Italy then this probably isn't for you, but if you are looking for a travel dvd with an entertaining host that can show you some of the places these countries have to offer, then look no further."
4,Helpful,"Not having read other Photoshop books, I don't have much basis for comparison, but I find this to be a helpful book for me to learn more about the program. I read through a bunch of them in the bookstore and this seemed like one of the better ones."
5,Learnt invalueable lessons from this book.,Photoshop Elements 4.0 may not be as feature rich as Photoshop CS. But it packs more than enough punch to stand on its own. Scott Kelby clearly illustates this point in this book. The organization of this book is very helpful to jump specifically to a particular technique and use them. The teach by example model is very effective. A must have reference for anyone using Photoshop Elements 4.0.
3,Lousy packaging,"Just got my 3rd season today. When I opened the package I found one DVD. No flip packaging. Just one spot for DVDs. Surprise, surprise discs one, two and three are stacked on top of on another on the same holder. VERY inconvenient. Come on Sony, charge a dollar more and give us a space for each DVD.The three stars is because of the packaging. I would give the show five stars."
3,$15.87 for just a little help along the way,This affordable straightener has all the necessary features: temperature adjustment and a wide plate.
3,medium quality,"It is inexpensive and of medium performance. It does not have combs to gide hair through, but frankly, I think it makes it easier to glide hair through (might not be the case for curly hair). It heats up easily once you get it, but after months of use the heating time takes a little longer. It also can clamp up from time to time while in use (it has a closing clamp at the end. just don't press too firmly)I have fine hair, and need a straightener to just smooth hair out. For me, this works great. If you can't afford a more expensive one, or need time to look, get this in the meantime.I give it a three, because of clamping and medium quality in built."
3,HOW MUCH?,FOr $371.00 I'd expect Joe Walsh to bring it to my house perosnally and show me a few of the songs. I love Joe's work and his wit. The guy selling this book for almost 400 bucks is off his rocker.
3,Ok product,"While it was nice having a mirror, it was useless at night. The light is to dim to illuminate the mirror so you couldn't see the baby. The mirror size is good, any bigger and it may distract you."
1,Where's the Baby?,"This thing is impossible to install so that you can see the baby, the light is useless and when it fell the mirror cracked."
3,Pretty Nice...,"There's not a whole lot here that isn't on Sand In The Vaseline. Though it is a well designed set, and does boast some great features, is it really worth the money? If you're a hardcore Heads fan, yes. If you enjoyed a lot of their songs, but never really listened to a whole album, then no.Basically, it's an updated greatest hits, with a little nod towards better production. But pound for pound, Sand In The Vaseline wins, hands down."
2,Too facile,So this is what Knopf is publishing now? The novel is just so formulaic and tired. Gay young man sees shrink and then thinks about his past and cut to a flashback of that scene in the past. Back to the present and the phone line scenario which works once and only once. Back to shrink and another scenario. Flash to scene in real time. Just not artful at all. 1 1/2 stars
5,cool band,"I don't own any other GVSB albums so I don't know if it's as good as their other cd's. I think that they have a cool & original sound. they're electronic with sounding techno-ish(which isn't bad). my favorite song is roxy though they all rock.though all their songs are good I like the more melodic ones(roxy,psycho future,etc.)if your into original artists GVSB won't disapoint."
5,body book,"terrific book. lots of good material for project and teaching about interrelated systems. The other science teachers in my building want to use it, too."
5,Great models,"This book offers great opportunities for learning the way kids like best: by DOING! They will build paper models layer by layer of the human body's different systems. I will upload some photos into Customer Images.At our house, the 7 year old is the most enthusiastic, but the 6th grader is the real champ.These models are great visual aids for presentations or science fair projects, and would make very nice Open House projects for classrooms.The book offers many opportunities to round out your child's learning with journal assignments, paired learning, group learning, and skits. Also offers lots of information on what illegal drug use does to the body systems."
4,Different.,I started reading this book. But had to put it down due to the holidays.I have picked it back up and will finish reading the story now.We used this as our book club book. obviously I hadn't finished itbut it got mixed reviews. some loved it some didn't like it at all.
3,"A very nice gift basket, but pretty pricey","Distilled to its essence, what you have here is a little less that two pounds of Ghirardelli chocolates, in various configurations, a nice basket, and a bow. Ghiardelli is decent American made chocolate, though hardly gourmet quality by European standards. Still, this would make a nice gift.So the question becomes, how much is two pounds of Ghiardelli chocolate and a basket worth? Surely it's not worth the list price of this basket, at least not on the basis of contents. You could assemble the same basket yourself for probably 1/3 of the list price. But that's not really the point...If you're looking at this basket on Amazon, you're looking for something nice to send as a gift. This is a nice looking gift that would be sure to bring some pleasure to a chocolate fan.I'd rate the basket a high 4 stars for appeal, and 2 stars for value. Call it 3 stars on average."
5,no amount of praise does this film justice,"This movie is sheer viseral comic grey matter. Nothing can or will be able to touch it's brilliants, in a hundred years! Lewis doesn't say a word through out the entire film but doesn't need to. Sometimes words Do...get in the way"
4,Funny for its time :-),"By today's standards, this may not be considered an outrageously funny movie - back in the day, I can see that this would have been hilarious. I really love Jerry Lewis and it's one of the better roles I've seen him in. He doesn't have too much of a dialogue in this - whenever he is playing the bellboy character Stanley, he only whistles and uses his facial expressions to emote his clumsiness.The only scene where I truly laughed out loud, was when he was in charge of the bellboy desk for a short time and one of the four phones would ring. Do you think he knew which phone to answer? Of course not. Other than that, it was good throughout but just not as funny as I would have hoped. He is a genius for sure, but I prefer him doing his crazy voices. Even so, I'd recommed this to his fans, as I'm sure they'll definately enjoy it."
5,very touching,"although the episode 'law and lawlessness' was a drag, 'cats and girls and spaceships' was very touching as jim finds his first love and she dies without him knowing."
4,Cute child's necklace,"Very cute and tiny necklace for child -- looks just like picture. Chain gets tangled a bit easily, but can be undone with straight pin."
3,Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Pendant,On line this product looked to be for an adult but when it was received was more for a child so we gave it to a grandchild rather than the adult we intended it for.
4,amethyst Butterfly pendant,"my wife really likes it, she seldom takes it off. good value for the money.it was smaller than i thought it would be, i did not look at the size carefully enough.the pendant has gotten caught around the clasp twice now for my wife."
2,necklace,Amazon you need to please put the right size when you advertize a product. That necklace is SMALL. Like for a child. Not an adult.
3,"It is pretty, but too small.","I bought this butterfly necklace pendant for my wife as a Christmas present. The little butterfly is cute and pretty. However, I was a bit disappointed as to how tiny that butterfly is."
1,Not what I expected!!!,I did not read any reviews first but if I had I would not have bought this. It is a deceiving picture. The chain looks to be somewhat tough but is actually very thin and cheap. The butterfly is TINY. I was very dissapointed with this purchase. It is being returned.
3,"Sterling Silver Amethyst Butterfly Pendant, 18"" Review",I bought this gift for my mother for Christmas along with the matching earrings. I noticed at first glance that the pendant was really small.......like smaller than the matching earrings. Its not a deal breaker though. For the price its good quality though i gotta say now that ive had a chance to think about it this product is probably better for a little girl. Honestly the pendant is so small no one is going to notice what the heck it is unless your up close to it. With that said its still a cute pendant and im glad i got it for her.
3,"Not horrible, but not great.","This was a bit smaller than I thought it would be and because the amethysts are a bit dull and not all of the same hue, it doesn't show as well as I had hoped. Because the pendant is so small, the chain should be shorter. Two and half stars is what I would actually give"
1,Too small,"I thought this item was going to be much larger, but it's maybe 1/2 inch in diameter at most. Not pleased at all"
2,Too small,"The butterfly is very nice, but the only problem is that it is way too small. You cannot see it. I should have read the reviews :("
5,Perfect for a young girl!,I just love this little butterfly necklace that I gave my 10 yr. old daughter for Christmas. She has a Feb. birthday and the amethyst is her birthstone. The butterfly is small but very pretty. Better for a young girl than an adult.
1,Too small to tell it's a butterfly,"Plenty of sparkle, but so small can't determine it's shape. I am returning. Was supposed to be a gift for my grand daughter."
3,more champagne than citrine,"I was looking for a small, charming necklace that I could sleep in without being strangled, and I could shower in without it rusting, and that I could wear with most jewelry without a clash. This necklace is perfect. I wish it were more true to color as that was the initial reason I purchased."
1,"Not recieved,was supposed to arrive Dec.6th.","I am very irritated,this is supposed to be a Christmas gift.It was to arrive by December 6th,not here yet and this is the 19th.I can find no way to talk to a human being and voice my problem.I have never had this happen when ordering from Amazon.This is very disappointing."
5,Best tea ever!,This tea is far superior to any brand we have used.. The flavor is great and it does noy keep us awake at night!
1,Purely enjoyable.,"This assortment of decaf tea is a delight I look forward to in the evening. The flavors are especially refreshing and varied. My mood dictates which one I select! I've ordered it before, and I'll order it again by the case."
1,horrible taste!!! It does not even tastes nor smell like cinnamon,"horrible taste!!! It does not even tastes nor smell like cinnamon , I have tried different brands and this is the worst !!!!!"
3,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"I drink several cups of tea a day. I like Earl Gray but the Bigalow doesn't have the intensity and spunk I expect from tea. Leaving it steep longer makes it nasty and bitter, of course. I won't order it again. It isn't bad, it just isn't my cup of tea."
1,A Formula for Death,"Green tea may be a valuable part of the diet for many people, however, consuming green tea is either a knowing or unknowing choice of suicide by those of us who need blood thinners. Because of its vitamin k content, it reduces or eliminates the affect of blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavis and even low dose aspirin. Vitamin K, present in extremely high quantities in green tea, promotes coagulation and consequently the formation of clots. Clots kill through stroke and heart attack.If you have either been prescribed blood thinners of any type or a family history of vascular problems, green tea should be regarded as a powerful and potentially deadly poison."
3,Decaf lemon tea,The tea is good but not very strong. I feel the need to use two bags a cup of tea. It would be better if it could be a little stronger.
2,Peach Tea,Unhappy with taste. Not as peach tasting as I would have liked. Disappointed. Gave it away.
4,Best Green Tea,"This is the best green tea available on the market. I switched from coffee to green tea for the health benefits. Constant Comment Green Tea is sometimes difficult to find in the grocery store; therefore, I am thrilled to be able to buy it from Amazon."
5,Great Tea!,"This is the only Organic, Decaf, Breakfast tea that I have been able to find. It tastes great for a tea in a bag so don't try to compare it to loose tea. The price is very reasonable also."
2,40 packs. I would not buy again.,"Each bag is not sealed, bags are sealed in groups of four. Not good for one cup at a time."
5,Love this tea!,Hard to find decaf tea in grocery stores. Love Chai tea and this is just perfect for home and work.
5,Hard to find,This tea is my favorite... And I've looked every where in town for it and have been unable to locate it. I was so happy when I found it for such a great price here on Amazon.
5,Great Tea,"Green Tea is my favorite of all teas. I especially like Bigelow for its flavor and the fact its organic makes it even better. I sweeten it with Stevia Liquid or powder. It taste great. I keep a pitcher in my refrigerator, so its always ready when I am. Thanks Bigelow.L. Smith"
2,Not my cup of tea,I generally enjoy Earl Grey and have been buying Trader Joes own brand. I find this rather insipid and tend to avoid drinking it - which is too bad since I bought several boxes. It's rather weak and not as full flavored as other Earl Grey and Lady Grey teas I've tasted. Twinings is a better product.
2,no longer just green tea with blueberry,Loved this tea when it was green tea with blueberry. Now it's blueberry and acai and not as good. Buyer beware!
3,good but not great,"this green tea with blueberry is ok, but not great. the blueberry taste is very subdued, which would be fine, but the green tea itself isnt that great tasting. it's drinkable, dont get me wrong, but i've had better green teas with blueberry (trader joes and celestial seasonings). if you're not too too picky or have yet to try a green tea with blueberry, give it a try. just dont have really high expectations (as i did)."
5,Smooooth,This tea is a lot better than some other green teas I've had. It's very smooth when you make it as opposed to some of the generic brands that leave a harsh aftertaste.
3,"It is a really good change of pace, interesting flavor.","I'm not crazy about mint teas in general, but this one does have an interesting flavor. Unfortunately I had the same experience as another reviewer, and the tea tastes old. The sell by date says it doesn't expire until like 2014, but I wonder if maybe they repackaged old stuff? (It only gives a date on the outside box containing the 6 boxes of teas.) I bought several other teas from the Amazon that were fine, just this one.That being said, this is a great tea for people that drink a lot of tea and want a change of pace once and awhile. Just get it somewhere else than Amazon!"
1,Good Tea but inaccurate listing!!,"This box of green tea has the tea bags packaged 4 per wrapper. So unless you plan on brewing a whole pot at a time, do not buy this! Nowhere in the item description does it say anything about being packaged that way and this is a NON-RETURNABLE item!"
2,Packaging unsatisfactory.,The bags are too big and I do not like adhesive gluing the string to the bag. Otherwise the price was excellent.
2,The mint flavor is a suggestion only,"I bought this tea because I enjoy mint iced teas. I find the flavor refreshing when it is hot out. This tea just does not deliver the mint like other brands do. I find this to be problematic when I bought the tea specifically for this purpose. I confess, it could be that this tea just does not like cold brewing, but that would make it unlike every other tea I have ever bought.If you wish to enjoy the tea as a cold brew, look elsewhere."
5,Love Ooolong Tea!,"I fell in love with Oolong tea more than forty years ago; a little over thirty years ago, I moved to a small town where there are no tea shops, and no supermarkets here carry Oolong, so I've gotten along with just a cup here and there when I've traveled to places where it was available in restaurants. It never occurred to me that Amazon.com might be able to supply me with it until a friend suggested I check with them.It was one of the best moves I've ever made. I finally have an endless supply of top-grade Oolong tea; it looks like I'm going to be an Amazon.com customer for life."
2,Disliked packaging.,"I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of ""Pack of six 40-count boxes"" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a ""normal"" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The ""savings"" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk."
2,Too weak,"I loved Twinings Earl Grey many years ago but heard the company had weakened their formula, so I ordered the Bigelow instead. It smells good, but what a disappointment. It was way too bland. I'd rather drink plain Lipton."
4,Really lemony without being too sour.,"We get it by ""subscription"" and it usually runs out before the next box comes.It's a little bland and tends to be a ""sick day"" favorite."
2,Product of China.,"Although this is a wonderful tasting tea, Bigelow confirmed via email today that this product is grown in China. I think it is then packaged in the U.S."
4,It's OK,"I've been searching for Jasmine tea just like tea in China. This one is ok, but a bit weak taste in comparison to other Jasmine tea available in market. It's great price. I would recommend Yamamotoyama Jasmine tea if you are willing to pay extra $ instead of this product, yet if you are looking for best price Jasmine tea, this is it."
4,This is a pretty cool book with lots of info.,"Mr Scott's Guide to the Enterprise is a good book with lots of information. However, some of the information is speculation. Cool picts, it is a really popular book and I like it."
2,Way too many cliches,"The author piles up the problems one after the other for the heroine, the villain is as transparent as glass, and the whole premise of his motives and the way he acts is just unbelievable. Add to it some really wooden sex scenes with awful dialogue and the whole thing was a chore to read from start to finish. This was my first Anderson book ever, and I have to say that as a fan of Lavyrle Spencer, I was sadly disappointed and would never waste my time with another of these books."
4,He sure looks nice on the shelf..,"For a collector, this toy is quite good. It is very detailed, and just looks darned cool. He has his mace, and his sword. You'll need this toy to complete the array of major characters from the Pellenor Fields battle in ROTK. (He fought with Eowyn, as if you could forget that awesome scene..)But, while he is detailed and very nice looking, he has some problems.1: His arms are too short.2: He has some trouble standing.3: His robes are awesome, but they render his button activated action feature completely innefectual. They get in the way. Plus, the mace is so heavy, and it is attached to a chain, so it hardly works anyway.Nonetheless, this is one of the best looking LOTR action figures in my opinon."
5,A true survivalist...and a funny guy!,After seeing a few episodes of SURVIVORMAN on TV I was instantly hooked. Les Stroud places himself in real life situations and always comes out on top. Dont just watch it on tv...buy the season on dvd...you wont regret it!
5,good stuff,"alot to be learned and very fun to watch too, came from seller fast and in great condition"
4,"Worthwhile Show, Lack of planned menu programming","First of all, The show is terrific for its since of reality for survival purposes. I bought this when it was going for only $10 and I would have paid twice that. With so many episodes, each atleast 45 minutes or longer, you come away with two disks, and many hours of footage.But, Heres the nitpicking, There are no special features to explore (we would all like to see more of his crew coming to get him, how the show is made or broken down) maybe its just me.Also... there is no play all, certainly the ease of programming a play all deems this to be a flaw.Thirdly, entering the episode the show is broken into his days spent, where I can see this makes sense, the images are covered by numbers, and give you little reference to what actually happened on that day. (hence the reason youd go back to watch a particular day)Loved the DVD, dying to buy up the second season already."
5,If lovers,"Read my write up for IF 3.IF 1 and Live in Europe 72 are the start and end of a great lineup. Buy them both. Skip 2 & 3 and all four weak attempts without the second reeds player. Forgotten Roads is a Best of, and is a great mix, but strangely does not include ""Your City is Falling"" , but luckily that song is on the Live album. Also strangely, the live version of What did I say About the Box Jack is the weakest song on the live album.If is very hard to locate in Amazon, because a zillion Disk titles hold the word ""if"". Thank you Repetoire and Castle for beating Capital to the punch and realizing that there is a market for this classic stuff. The Live in Europe '72 disk even contains the meaning of the title What Did I Say About the Box, Jack?"
3,College,"I only bought this because the class I was taking required it. The professor of the course wrote the book. It's not as bad as the other required that he also wrote, but I didn't read past the first few chapters."
5,Great hip-pocket review.,I bought the book from Bill's shop in Canon City. I thought the book was a good companion to the knowledge I prevoiusly had. I like the combination of real experience by season as written.I especially liked the fly tying section. Bill explains how and when those flies are used.Bottom line; this is the only book I use for catching fish on the Arkansas river in Colorado.
2,dissappointed,"Nothing about fishing the river that wasn't in Marty Bartholomews book. There was a whole section on tying flies for the Arkansas, but since I don't tie, the book wasn't very valuable to me. Didn't teach me anything new."
1,Consumer Beware,"This is not the 1935 movie with Mary Astor, but rather a cartoon. The 1935 movie with Mary Astor is titled ""Dinky"" with no subtitle. The two movies have gotten confused in the Amazon data base. Now it is possible that 1 seller might be trying to sell the old 1935 movie, but most are selling the children's cartoon. Amazon needs to straighten out the labelling."
1,why is there no zero star option?,"simply does not work on many common OS's like media center and 98.Don't believe it, go to the web site and see how long at takes to find that out.NO RESPONSE AT ALL TO SUPPORT QUESTIONS."
1,Reading the Fine Print Did Not Help,"I recently purchased the MA-8212A package, and have been unable to get it to operate. When I contacted Mobile Action, they informed me that their software is not compatible with XP Media Center (which is what I have) but would work on XP Home and XP Pro. This contradicts the information on their packaging and in their advertising. Just be warned."
5,The best of all mp3 cd players out there,"This is one of the best slim players out there... great value for money,stylish,slim,best sound,good accessory package,good battery life...what more can u wish for in a player???"
1,Not robust at all,"I have purchased two IRiver CD players. The first one was defective from the start (no bass output). So I took a chance and ordered another player, which was this model (550). After using it for a few hours it broke -- the player cannot detect that a disk is loaded. It has not been treated roughly at all, but just sits on my desk. So, I am out several hundred dollars for nothing."
1,Too Expensive,"This product is good, but a little bit too expensive the price in Amazon is 161.49. and the MSRP from the fabricator iRiver is 149.99 This is a MSRP that item should be cheaper.Please review the prices.. Thanks"
3,mediocre,"I really cant think of more than one or two benefits that make the 550 better than my old sony AA powered CD player.First let me just say the wiring of the device is extremely awkward. The cords constantly get tangled up and you have to unplug everything usually in order sort it out. Another nuisance is the battery life. Typically you get about 7 or 8 hours out of them. It's convenient that they're rechargable but I usually listen to my discman when traveling and I had to be careful about running them down. I got more hours out of recharable panasonic AAs in my old sony discman, which didnt have all the bells and whistles the 550 has, but it did the job. The only thing I liked better about the 550 was the LCD screen. If you use certain programs to burn your CDs then the song title appears when playing.Truth be told its more of a hassle than its worth."
5,Righteous Traditional Root Favorites,"This collection contains some of the finest classic, spiritual, roots reggae selections I've sampled. The mid-late 70s reggae combined several musical styles: dub, some rock steady, and wonderful vocal harmonies. They're all represented on this fantastic compilation. Highlights include: Moulding, Ballistic Affair, Bredda Gravilicious, Battering Down Sentence, Two 7 Clash, Joggin, Trouble Me a Trouble You, & Rub-A-Dub Sound. Listen and let your mind float to the tropics man!"
1,Sound quality leaves much to be desired...,"It's a nice looking set. As other reviewers have said it is definitely lacking in artwork. My main issue is that the mix and overall sound is terrible. Yes, it is remastered and LOUDER but so what? Spend a little extra money and get the 2009 Remastered and Deluxe Versions of the individual albums. They are not as LOUD of a mix (why this is considered better is confusing - maybe it's easier than actually taking the time to mix the damn albums) but far superior. The 2009 versions make it sound like you are in the studio with the band. Geezers bass is so warm and alive it's incredible and all the harshness that is annoying about Tony's guitar solos and Bill's cymbals in the Black Box set is removed and you have a much more rounded and better sounding experience. Unless you're a collector of Sabbath (like me) that needs to have everything, avoid this set and get the 2009 Remasters."
5,"A True ""OLD"" Sabbath Fan!","First...don't let the name fool you...(It's my wifes Amazon account). I am a TRUE old Sabbath fan. Having seen them first the summer of 1972, 2 months BEFORE Volume 4 was released! The only REAL Black Sabbath was the Ozzy Sabs! Dio was good...but C'mon! This is the music that will live forever. Get this set and find out where it all began. The remastering is truly head-shattering!"
2,REALLY REMASTERED??? IT'S MORE LOUD BUT NOT REALLY BETTER....,"I bought this box and let me say something: these cd's sounds more loud but NOT BETTER than other previously remastered versions... Yes, you can get a nice book... a extra dvd (rare videos???) and all the Ozzy's Black Sabbath albums but... not the original art, not the better sound and a cheap poor pack if you compared with others collections o boxes(For 90 $$$???). If you have the Sanctuary or Castle remastered albums this Box is really unnecesary...If you want to made a ""upgrade"" of your Sabbath collection go for the new 2009 remastered and deluxe packs of Black Sabbath, Paranoid and Master of Reality... Great sound, new and rare songs and beauty new packs."
1,Terrible service,"They sent the package as they felt like and them term in the department of unidentified packages, I had to call the shipper to fix the problem, never more with this people....."
2,tv picture out of color,"I bought our tv as a christmas gift three years ago from target. I should have bought the protection plan, but i figured that a westinghouse should last more than three years. well, the picture is gone and I can find no help because of no extended plan. After reading other reviews, I plan on researching more before i buy again."
1,Don't bother...,"I got this TV/DVD combo for my cabin replacing a Toshiba REGZA 26LV47 26-Inch LCD HDTV with Built-in DVD Player. The Westignhouse is very low quality compared to the Toshiba in every way - the case is cheap, the remote is missing basic funtions like diplaying what track you are on and time remaining. The picture quality is pretty good but not as good as the Toshiba. When you stop the DVD, it doesn't save your place. It has only 3 picture modes - stantard, overscan and one more - the Toshiba has 5 which means you can pretty much find a mode that uses the whole screen no matter what the aspect is on the DVD whereas on the Westinghouse you cannot. To top it all off, the DVD player stopped working yesterday after a month and a half when I only use it every other weekend or so. I haven't tried to return it or get it fixed yet so we will see what happens later on that score."
5,Perfect,"It is not a sugar coating type of movie like you see from Hollywood.It is a down to earth story about two real people that had their fate altered by one event.No exaggerated traits in their characters and their emotions.No over the top nothing.Even though they had only crossed paths once, their lives were fused by the existence of the other. An unlikely strong bond between them was created with negative effects for both. It was a bond that had to be broken but not in a way you would expect from a movie but how it would happen in real life.See it."
4,"VERY Good Acting, Loose Plot, Cheap Ending","This is a very well-made film but it is not great. The story moves in one direction for two thirds of the duration and then collapses into something different and silly. I don't mean to be too harsh, but I expected more from the great actors and the relentless pressure of the film's start."
2,what happened here?,I am a Liam Neesom fan but this film did him no justice.... Boring and did not keep me interested at all.... I understand the plot of the movie but didnt follow the events of it. I am happy I didnt pay alot of money to see this film.
3,Wasn't able to watch the movie but looks like it would be good.,"We didn't have time to watch this movie as we had problems with our network. But, I hear it's pretty good and with Liam Neeson in it I am sure it is. We'll see it another time."
1,Waste of time .,"I really can not rate this video, cause I could not finish watching it. It was that bad for me. Maybe not for someone else , Just not my taste in movies."
3,gta has never een better,"all new map and tons of territory brin this game towards the top of my list of fav games. one major let down for me was that when i hooked up my alienware usb gamepad, not all of the buttons worked, and there were a few compatabilty issues with my videocard which as yet to fail me since. hogs up cpu and take hardcore vid card to run it nicely but overall the same as other systems wih the added bonus of a custom music station (with annoying commercials added). As a fan of the ps2 version, i must say they pulled it together mostly ok for the PC and aside from the fact that i was not aware that this version (2.0) didnt allow mods, i believe this is a grat buy for and gta fan"
2,"Good game, but requirements are too high!","When Vice City was released on the PC a while ago, almost everyone with a decent computer could play it. I have a Pentium D 3.00 Ghz with a Radeon X300, and I was able to play full settings, at a resolution higher than 1024X768. Enter San Andreas: I have to play with Low Visual Fx and 800X600X32 in order to play! On top of that, this game looks horribly jaggy without anti-aliasing, which slows the game down. I guess its something you have to live with, but it seems a bit strange that a decent computer would have to play at such low settings. Also, I could do without the N-word and the F-bombs."
2,Disappointed,I ordered Calvary Chapel Distinctives and received Harvest. I understand by same author but would have liked to have gotten what I ordered.
2,Manufacturing Time a disappointment for afficianados,"Any of us who love horology and want to learn more will be very disappointed by this book.It is very broadly based with virtually no supporting technical detail and numerous techical errors.For example it states that a pin lever watch has fewer moving parts than a jeweled lever...She freqeuently refered to Landes book but he in addition to being a respected academic is an enthusuastic collector....This book has no grabbing technical detail, not even enough to justify the sweeping economic statements she makes.To her credit she pointed out some trends and aspects of national markets I had not understood but it is tough going even for someone already deeply interested in this subject."
3,"Solid reading, but hard work","Don't expect a textbook on how to develop strategy (although, expect a similar result). Well thought-out and structured set of readings that provide insight into the process of developing strategy, from SWOT and Rumelt analysis (Conistency, Consonance, Feasibility, Advantage) through organizational structure and Entrepeneurship.However, I found the readings extremely hard work to read. It may be inexperience, but (especially in the early chapters), the readings simply take a LONG time to do (and I'm not a slow reader). A nice addition might be a more comprehensive summary of the readings at the start or end of each chapter.Overall, I go with a 3-star, mainly because of the reading difficulty more than the actual content."
5,great name and a great singer,Wow ! this guy sounds fantastic .somewhere between springsteen and tom waits.also some lovely guitar playing going on . tells a great story .well worth listening to . only one original on it but the other cds are all original stuff . this is a live recording thats 5 stars sounding to me .
1,Run away - terrible warranty policy!,"DeLonghi portable AC is a rip-off of unsuspecting consumers. Mine broke in a month and a half! And here is the best part. To get it fixed under warranty, I would have to ship it on my own expense to a service center in New Jersey, which, giving the weight and fragility of this thing, would cost me a small fortune. Basically, for all practical purposes, this is an expensive product with no warranty. I was lucky the seller took it back for a full refund.It works quite well when it does, though."
3,Disc Errors om Mavica Camera,"Like another reviewer, I have been experiencing disc errors using these Sony mini cdr with a Mavica camera. Approximately 10-15% of photos are corrupting. I am having issues with camera not recognizing a disc previously used a few hours before to take pictures. The camera acts if the disc is new and needs to be initialized. I have had no problems with the expensive Mavica CDR CDRW disc, so it is not the camera. This may be just a defective batch of discs."
2,Mainly of historical interest to Genesis fans...,"Each of the major non-lead-singing members of Genesis (Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett, Anthony Phillips), at some point between 1978 and 1983, got around to making an album where he sang all the lead vocals. None of them did a particularly good job, though all (particularly Hackett) would record better vocals later.Rutherford's vocals were arguably the worst of the lot (he himself said AVS made him realize his voice was ""crap""). He only sang lead once more, on ""Making A Big Mistake"" from the AGAINST ALL ODDS soundtrack. Whatever he did differently there, I wish he had done it when making AVS.At it stands, AVS is mostly a historical curiosity, though kind of a fun one. IMO the most successful track is ""Who's Fooling Who"". But there is no song that makes you forget this guy is no singer."
2,TRENDY,"this is a terrible attempt to mainstream techno. Overall, not a good album at all, with a couple exceptions (Uberzone, Icey). definitely not recommended"
4,Disc 2 much better,There's another review that sums my sentiments exactly. Disc 1 gets 2-3 stars (kind of like a rap with faster beat) But disc 2 is really good; 5 stars)
3,"This is modern ballet, not classical.","Fine if you like modern ballet set to a modern story. The prince, for example, is a film star."
4,A great ride!,"It took me a while to get through the first few pages, but after that I could not put it down! A fun read- intrigue, romance, the works!"
4,easy and convenient intro to French,"This format is for an iPod or a DVD player. I wouldn't say the content level is high. If that is what you want, Rosetta Stone or a complete Pimsleur package may be what you need. This is a traveler or business package with survival phrases, which have been sold for years. What makes this unique is that you get the visual and see actual interaction, which also gives you more cultural information."
2,"Not worth the time, energy or iPod space","Although this seemed like a great idea, this was difficult to use and certainly did not meet my needs. It did not instantly upload on my iPod as advertised, was difficult to find the file to upload and did not tell me the size of the software on the package so I would know whether or not I had enough room on my iPod for it in the first place. The instructions included in the package were inadequate. I did watch a lesson on my computer screen just to see if perhaps I should make the effort to make some space on my iPod for it or use it on my iPhone. Nope. The French speakers weren't adequate for a first-time French student, there was no phonetic pronounciation, and the lesson I viewed was downright tedious. Despite its reasonable price, I couldn't recommend this product even though the idea is a good one."
5,Great for any Dumas fan,"Love the ebook, would like a hard copy even more! Full of interesting tidbits about Dumas and Paris thru the centuries."
3,"Nice mounting , ugly stone","Seller has very fast delivery, The rings mounting is substantial and finished flawlessly, However I am dissapointed in the quality of the stone, it's dead and glassy looking. I've seen CZ's that are nearly indistinguishable from real diamonds, but this is not in the same leauge....it looks totaly fake"
3,Good read,Decent short story and a quick read. The ending is not exceptional but the trip to get there worth while.
1,Poor Quality,"This shirt is made of very poor quality material, and It is very rough and scratchy to wear . Not worth buying."
1,Playing Chess,I find the programme difficult to use and not very reliable.Will have to call for assistance.
4,"It'sBen'sTime,To shine","I've been waiting for years to hear from this talented son of Carly's and J.T's.Ever since I heard him sing on Carly Simon's 1994 CD,""Letters Never Sent.""Ben had his choice of record deals,but decided to stay home and bake bread,instead of making it.I'm glad he decided to come OUT and Shine.This debut album is Mellow,Soft,and unpolished.The Best Tracks,""Island,Mushroom Dance,""and my favorite cut,""Rain."" The music was taken from his Mom's 1980 song,""James."" It even has the same line,""When I lift this Shell to my ear,I can Hear..""The Zombies classic,""Time of the Season,"" is another favorite,and would be a great single.I just don't care for the way they produced this one.Carly and James sing backup on some of the songs.(I think it would be a great idea for the TALENTED Taylor family,Carly,James,Sally and Ben, to record an Album TOGETHER,and tour TOGETHER.)I'm really not dissapointed with ""Famous among the Bears."" I think this artist has a great future ahead."
5,Subtly enchanting,"A heart-warming story that is very realistic, yet very touching. The characters earned my sympathy as the story progressed and I felt I could relate to them. It is also written in a simple and honest style which makes it a joy to read. I practically found myself recalling scenes from the story long after I read the book. I will not reveal much about the plot, but the books was simply so emotionally uplifting."
2,Almost the Worst CD I ever purchased,If you would like to buy a CD of Great New Wave songs sung by what sounds like professional German karaoke singers than this is the CD for you! What a mistake! The only thing good about this CD is that I can now track down the original groups from the CD insert and buy the proper versions of these song. I'm putting this CD on the auction block to salvage some of my loss.
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"Yes, I know gay indie films are often low-budget and fall short in many regards, but that in itself doesn't stop me from enjoying a gay film that actually says something. This film seemed to be so concerned about being deep and portentious that many of the most basic elements of a film (plot, character believability and motivation, character development) were either not considered at all, or just de-prioritized. The film is a poorly-made confusing jumble of scenes about characters we never care about, and who don't even have the benefit of at least being nice to look at as we watch them ham-handedly deliver their clinkers of dialogue. Who do I contact to get these two hours of my life back??"
5,Good Times!,"This movie might actually make you cooler just by watching it. It's 1996 Los Angeles in a way you've never seen it, but is much more accurate than either the gay gay films (""Jeffrey"") or the gritty punky angry urban ones - it falls in between the two. And the soundtrack is fantastic, really really really good. It's worth it just for the soundtrack."
2,"Good concept, bad production",I thought the idea behind the film and the undertones where good if not great. The acting was questionable at best and the production quality was poor. I wish I could say more possitive things about this film but I honestly can not. Poor investment.
5,Love it!!!!,"We are extremely pleased with our purchase. The camera is very easy to use. Very intuitive. It takes great pictures. We get compliments on our photos all the time because the colors are so vibrant and the resolution is so sharp. This was our first digital camera. We love the idea of being able to take as many pictures as we want and we can delete what doesn't turn out. I shopped around before I bought it, and I felt we got the best deal from Amazon. Definitely a wonderful camera for the price. And I also love that you can add lenses/filters to it. The Kodak Easyshare software makes the picture easy to edit (if you want) and share with others."
1,0 Stars. Broke after 2 months,I had this camera for 2 months. It was kept in a case and was very well taken care of. I would not even allow my husband to touch it. I was taking pictures and then one suddenly came out as a white screen. I took another and the same thing. I asked my husband what he thought was wrong. We took out our memory card and tried internal. Same thing again. He said maybe it was the LCD screen. We loaded the pictures in the computer and it was even worse. I contacted Kodak several times. They don't care about their customers. I have talked to several others in similar situations with similar results. We will try to get their attention with a lawsuit. If interested contact me [...]
4,wonderful camera,"I decided on this camera after receiving photos from a friend that had a Kodak. The images were amazingly sharp and the prints I made looked professional. I hate reading owners manuals, but this camera is extremely user friendly. My one complaint is that the batteries that come with the camera are not rechargable. The camera is a little bulky (less than the previous model), but I bought it for the quality of photos, not to fit into my back pocket. It is very easy to download the photos to my computer using the USB port, however I have a little trouble transferring them to the other photo program I prefer to use, but this is most likely my fault due to lack of knowledge of the programs. If you are looking for a camera to preserve memories, I highly recommend the Z740."
2,Watch out for compatibility,"Have had one that is identical (or so I thought) for a couple of years now, it has always been a great card. For some reason the new one won't work in any of my older equip.(PDA or camera). After a little digging around, have found that the newer card uses MLC flash as opposed to SLC like the old one. Sent it back for a quick and easy refund. Found SLC ones available at another site."
5,Fast and stable,"I use this in a Palm Treo 680 and Lifedrive. It has proven stable, fast, and reliable."
4,Thanks to Sony!,"Why it took Sony so long to decide to release the total Stooges catalog on DVD we may never know. But it's a thrill to watch even the poorest of these shorts in clear, pristine condition."
4,Not for beginners,"I like this video, but I have taken dance lessons throughout my life. The instructors do try to tell you what to do, but there is no step-by-step instructions so you have to watch intently, which means you are watching them dance instead of dancing yourself. Personally, I do not like one of the dances, but the other three are fun.This is only the second exercise video I have ever purchased. I like dancing for exercise, so I keep doing it, but I think that these instructors are versed in teaching classes, not doing exercise videos, so they have trouble teaching the steps AND making the video a workout. This would GREATLY benefit from a starter DVD that taught all the steps so that by the time you get to the dances you know what you're doing and what to expect."
4,very entertaining,the video is kind of intense but a lot of fun to do. when its tricky you cant help but laugh at the moves your actually doing which keeps you going and having a good time !
4,Silly Fun,"I bought this because my grandaughter and I watch the show together. She liked the dancers and we though it would be fun. It is! I know I will never be a dancer, but the laughing and trying are worth the cost of this DVD. It really is a good work out. There is enough on it to keep you learning and sweating for a long time."
4,Dancing with the Stars-cardio dance,"I liked this video, but probably because I'm a dance teacher.....but of ballet/tap,jazz-not ballroom. It was easy for me to follow, but not so for my husband who is dance challenged. They start out showing the steps slowly. Then just when you think you have it,they throw in new stuff in the combination. This was frustrating to someone(husband) who has a hard time getting the basic steps. On the up side, I think it's a fun and nice mix of styles and you can get a workout if you start at the warm-up, continue with the combination and cool down without quitting."
4,"Fun and Good Stress Release, but Not Weight Release","I personally enjoy dancing and have a lot of fun doing the dances in this video (especially the jive), however, I didn't shed any pounds doing this. Maybe I would need to eat a lettuce leaf + exercise(like all other diets) to lose weight, but I still enjoy the dances and recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to learn certain moves. It is a lot of fun and a good stress buster at the end of a bad day."
2,Not Worth It,only if you would like to learn some basic dance steps would I reccommend this DVD. If you are looking for a great dance workout this is not for you. I do like that you can customize your workout and the music is great but the moves are hard to follow and the improv was a COMPLETE waste of time.
1,Frustration,"This video left me a tiny bit sweaty, but a lot frustrated. I couldn't even make it all the way through--half way through the second routine, I was lost. Save your money! I think I'd do better just having fun dancing to my own music."
2,Lackluster Dancing with the Stars DVD,"I was dissappointed at the lack of instruction in this DVD. There is an assumption that you already know how to dance. Dance terms are bandied about such as chaissez and plie, and potubourais as though we have had years of ballet training. It is a good cardio workout if you can catch up and learn the steps quickly. It seems more like a vehicle to showcase the 3 dancers from the show rather than to teach anyone to dance."
2,Not for beginners,This video was hard to follow because they do not explain all of the dance moves. Ashly and Kym were ok as instructors. Maksim was stiff as a board.
4,Cha Cha Cha,"I love DWTS and have been wanting to learn ballroom dancing for years. I was pysch to see that they came out with a work DVD. All in all it's pretty good, but I wish there were more instructional breakdown of the steps. You're thrown right into the routines. Sometimes the dancers throw out dance terms they assume we know the meaning. It's a fun addition to your workout routine."
5,With or without experience,"This is a very hard dance workout. The dancers tell you what steps they're gonna do and they do it like you know what they're talking about. I have no dance experience whatsoever, so half the time I had no clue what they were doing, but I tried to do it anyway. Now I probably won't be entering any dance competitions any time soon, but I had a great time, my heart was racing and I was covered in sweat. I actually felt like I'd had a great workout. Not to mention that I wanna do it again and again to actually learn the dances. I think this is a great video for people with or without dance experience. Unless you frusterate easily then this might not be for you. But if your the type of person that loves a challange, this tape is awesome."
1,Dance Driven DVD is better,Very hard...not what I expected. Try Blake McGrath's Dance Driven ( from the TV Show So You Think You Can Dance...when it comes out. I bought a copy from him when he was only selling on his site...much better!
1,"The most annoying ""work-out""","I love dance workouts, so I thought I'd give this one a try. The female instructors are simply annoying and the male instructor is too flat and boring. The guy I could deal with, but the female instructors were TOO annoying with their overly perky attitudes. I've never seen any exercise instructor that annoying, honestly. Besides the personality problem, the moves in this ""work-out"" were very boring and didn't do much to raise my heart rate. If you want a workout DVD I suggest you go look elsewhere. There are plenty of other DVDs that do the trick easily and much less annoyingly."
2,Death and memory,"As the first person to review this book, I feel the responsibility weighing heavily upon me to address the fatal paradox lying at its core - and I don't mean fatal metaphorically. The book covers a lot of ground in its suggestions for things to do (and places to go) before you die, and on the whole these things do generally indeed fulfil an undeniably high level of unforgettableness. Surely, however, in the given circumstances, unforgettableness is largely an irrelevant concept? With death just around the corner, quite unmemorable, quickly forgotten activities serve just as well to fill in the time. If proximity to death offers anything positive at all, it's the fact that you no longer have to remember anything for very long..."
2,Interesting and original but also lacking,"I was excited to read this book, but I found the first half of it very slow, and only in the last 1/4th of the book did the pace pick up to the point where I would have felt bad not finishing it.The largest problem I have with this book is some of the characters. Seeker, the main character, is underdeveloped and rather bland, though it is hinted at that he has a special spiritual connection with their god, which is known as the All and Only. The point of view of Cheerful Giver seemed rather pointless to me, and slowed down the book's pace.On the other hand, I found the Wildman an interesting character. Described as a golden, beautiful river bandit, he is a violent, selfish, and naive young man at the beginning of the book but near the end he begins to learn how it feels to love people and care about their safety.All in all, worth a read if you are willing to tolerate the flaws and overall slower pace."
5,Into the Pride review,"I took this dvd on a punt,i'd never seen it on tv but i saw an advertisement on a commercial on one of my other discovery channel dvds.In short it's really good and Dave really is a calls it like it is kinda guy,and that with the nature,the passion to protect the lions,and the whole journey from start to finish makes this a enjoyable dvd if u feel like transporting mentally to wild africa for a while.I like it,daves cool.the animals are cool.Good one to watchDave has the heart and courage of a lion,eg how he walked up to brutus and cleo etc when they didn't fully know him that well.But its that self confidence,belief and skill he has with lions that takes him tothe next level.WELLDONE dave i'm a new fan now,love your work and i hope u make many more shows like this in the future i'll keep a keen eye out.just be careful out there buddy ;) peace"
2,"Good idea, bad book","The perfect example of why this book is woefully inadequate is the entry for Papa Johns Pizza.Nary a mention of the millions given to anti-choice groups by its founder and I believe CEO. Also no accounting of money spent on lobbying, though I don't know if that information is public.This book is a great idea and I hope someone will actually put together a great book on the topic.This is not it."
3,not really long enough,"If you are a beginner who wants to learn to play from a book then this book is ok, but it is really not long enough.There are a lot of things to understand when you set out to play chess. It is more that learning how the pawns and all the the other pieces move, and how to set up the chessboard correctly. Though you don't have the learn them all, right at the start, it is important to have the reference information available in case you have questions.My experience of learning to play chess is that beginners have a lot of basic questions, and that just thinking you can teach a few moves is not enough. Apart from that I though the book was quite good to read."
4,"I love this stuff, but it does have a strange smell","I absolutely love this stuff and I swear by it! I've been using this witch hazel for about 4 or 5 months now and I'm still on the same bottle! I use it everyday (sometimes twice a day) as an astringent after I wash my face and before I moisturize. The product is great and helped clear my moderate acne. The only reason I gave the product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the smell. It reminds me of a bonfire (burning wood). I got used to the scent after about a week but it still bothers my boyfriend, who can smell it on my face sometimes if I'm sitting or laying close to him. The product works so well that he's going to have to get over the smell. (:"
1,bisco are not all they're cracked out to be....,this album cannot be compaired to anything like phish's early albums. bisco are simply NOT GOOD. there's much better music in the jam band scene to buy.
2,Track 1 is great!,"Hanging out in a hip bar in Montreal late one night this amazing song comes on. I run over to the DJ ""What is this?"". He tells me it's Hint Hint: Young Days. I go home thinking I've found my new favorite band and promptly order this record. It comes in the mail and I pop it in. Track 1 is that song I heard, I'm in love all over again. After that track, it's all downhill... WAY downhill. Bummer."
3,They lost something here...,"Ok, I say that from the point of view of someone who doesn't all that often enjoy mellow music. I recognize this CD is still Hint Hint, and it's still good but to me, between Sex Is Everything and this, they lost something. They lost some of their sound that made it so unique, so awesome to listen to. I bought this CD expecting a follow up of Sex Is Everything, but I was mistaken. It's all more mellow (minus the first track), so if you're into mellow music get this CD. If you're new to the band, give this one a listen and then buy Sex Is Everything. You will notice the difference."
5,Great Book!,"Got this for my 8 year old daughter, who LOVES horses, for Christmas. It is a wonderful book with a lot of information. My son has a Kingfisher Encyclopedia for his favorite sport, so I knew what kind of product this would be. It certainly did not disappoint!!! It's not really for younger children though, I think it's better for kids that can at least read fairly well independently."
5,Fabulous book!,"My daughter's life pretty much revolves around horses, so when I saw this book, I knew I had to have it. She loves it and is continually referring back to it on every occasion. Great quality and workmanship."
5,Awesome Book,"I really liked this book. Once I got this book, I learned a lot of cool stuff like the parts of a horse, different breeds, how to care for a horse, how to ride a horse,etc. I love horses, and this book was a lot of help to me, because I am around horses a lot. If I had to pick a favorite part of the book, it would probably have to be the pictures. They are so beautiful and colorful. Horses are so fascinating to me.They live a very different life than us, and have a very different perspective of the world than us. This book has taught me that, and lots of other stuff. This book isn't too long, and it's fun and easy to read for about any age. If you like horses, or need to know more about them, I recommend this book to you."
4,Great pictures and info,I bought this book for a a girl in the horse club. She loves learning all there is about horses. This a great accurate resource for children.
5,Excellent,"A must read, don't miss it. One of Stackpole's finest novels to date. There is strong character representation in here, and a well-described world. Few authors can pull off a convincing first-person narrative, and Stackpole's experience in this area sets the stage for a rivetting plot. The new twist this time is that the narrator (Tarrant Hawkins) is clearly speaking about past events. This technique will whet your appetite for a sequel; definitely read this novel before the Dragoncrown War books, as it gives a solid platform for those novels to launch from."
4,good prelude to what might be a decent series [no spoilers],"""The Dark Glory War"" is the prelude novel in The DragonCrown War Cycle series approximately one generation before the series officially starts. It is an entertaining book filled with creative battles and interesting people and will provide a strong groundwork for new characters further in the series.Although the mask that certain cultures wear is an unusual concept, I am not fond of it since a good smack could dislodge the mask to blind the person during combat. Various monsters seem to be hybrid or typical fantasy creatures with different classifications. Also there are some moments where a physical description is challenging to envision.Aside from the above aggravations, overall the book was good and I would recommend it. The ending was a shock. I look forward to continuing the series.Thank you."
2,Look for something else!,"My son likes a couple of the pooh games, but the others seem to have gliches. Very difficult to get out of the game. I usually have to just turn the computer off to get out of it. The pooh cd also messes up the graghics even after I get out of the game and have to restart the computer to fix it. The pooh game seems to have good ideas, just too many bugs to be worth it!"
1,Too much wriggle room,"There's too much space between the two parts that slide over each other, and too much room between my hitch receiver and the ball mount. I'm afraid the gap will only get bigger as the parts rock back and forth against each other during use. There's too much room in the hole for the hitch pin, also."
4,Good sequel to MOONSPEAKER.,"This is the sequel to MOONSPEAKER, which is an excellent fantasy. Once again, I enjoyed reading about this world of psi talents. I did go down a star because some of the side trips were a little mind-boggling. I would also have liked a little bit more interaction between Haemas and Kevisson. They spend most of the book apart, which is a shame because they make a fabulous couple. But that's the romance reader in me."
2,BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS N O T A HARD COVER IT WAS A SOFT COVER , AND FAIRLY WORN , I WAS DISAPOIUNTED. HOPE THEY LEARN TO SEND WHAT IS ORDERED . BATE AND SWITCH WHICH THEY DID IS ILLEGAL , AND WILL EVENTUALLY WILL COME BACK TO BITE THEM."
4,"UNIQUE, SLAYS TRADITIONAL VIEWS.","This is a positive and deeply researched book. It politely refutes the anti-Roman revisionism that was common in the late twentieth century. Mr. Millar lucidly describes how the Roman Republic was a ""varied democracy."" Focusing mainly on the period 80-50bc. He sites public speeches to the existing records, elucidating that Rome during the Republic was a far more participatory form of government than was previously believed. Ex: ""Decision making was not found in the Curia, but the Forum where the everyday citizens gathered."" All eight chapters are insightful and technical terms are explained. This volume will interest general readers, and students of both Roman and political history."
1,Disney Learning Kindergarten Bundle,This is a great learning series for kindergarten age children. My 5 year old grandson is learning to use the computer with ease and also learning at a higher level with reading and math.
1,Don't buy!,"This film was a complete waste of money and time. Unless you enjoy watching a bunch of nude guys prance around, stretch, and hint about sex, get some real porn action!"
5,Don't Even Go Near a Courtroom Without It!,"This is the single most useful psych resource I've ever used, and I have a pretty extensive library. The explanations of some of the internal features of the MMPI-II were impressive and helpful even to a Ph.D. psychologist with 30 years' clinical experience! Unless you have a graduate degree in psychology, this book is your best bet for mounting an effective challenge to bad, sloppy, or harmful psychological testing."
3,Childish Things - hmmm,"I decided to read this book after scanning the first 2-3 pages. It looked interesting and the reviews on the front were raving. Well, overall, the author has an interesting ""Brit"" way with using complex and fairly unusual words but sorry to say, I was not impressed. I had to force myself to finish the entire thing.this often happens a whole lot to me but I find that I can often tell what is going to happen in the end and this can of spoils it for me especially if the journey to that spot was blah, blah.The characters are alive, I have to say and it givesn an interesting foray into what happens to the perspectives of folks when they have come to the ""golden"" era of their lives."
2,There's more to the Gulf than NO,"Dare I say, shallow; no depth. I love NO and the bayous (wetlands), and agree that they need to be saved. However, this seemed to be more about showcasing a 13 year old prodigy and the musicians of NO and their travails before, during and after Katrina. I'm sure the folks of Pass Christian could tell a tale or two also. In the aftermath of the BP oil spill, and the recent flooding of the Mississippi, I would like to see focus on the entire Gulf Coast/wetlands region; not just NO. God bless those hearty souls who have survived and persevered through these disasters."
2,scratches all over,I bought this to replace a scratched copy I currently had... this one was COVERED in scratches. They didn't even look like they were from normal wear.
4,Great shoe,"This shoe is a great product. The shoe is really comfortable to wear and comfortable to walk in. The shoe is pretty light weight and doesn't feel heavy. Because the shoe is water proof, the leather is a little bit stiff and sometimes a little warm inside. The sole of the shoe is really durable. Overall, this is a good walking shoe for the rainy and wet climate."
1,Uncomfortable,"I've worn Rockport shoes for years, but this is the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever worn from any manufacturer. At first I thought they just needed breaking in, but it's been a couple months now and they still hurt."
3,Snug fit- slow to break in,"I have a high arch and wide foot. I thought the 2E would do the trick, but I've worn these shoes for 4 days and they are still tight. The shoe looks great, but sizing might be off. I've never ordered a triple E, but that might be what's needed with this one. I've worn Rockports for the last 15 years....maybe the fact that these were made in Vietnam has something to do with the size issue?"
1,Do Not Buy this Book!,"If you are at all familiar with SAP, this book will only serve to collect dust on your bookshelf. The explanations are at such a high level and basic that it is a complete waste of time. Further more, it never really talks about the SAP gui interface or configuration steps. Only buy this book if you want an over-priced paper weight!"
1,Totally useless,"The book is so generic describing SAP FI and CO modules that I hardly believe an administrator can do anything with it. There are no examples at all, the underlaying accounting techniques are offen imprecise and not linked to SAP processes in the adeguate way."
2,This book is discusses more of accounting less of SAP Appli,"I was able to read some chapters of this book. Basic concept of acconting and costing/controlling areas are explained in a less dramatic way. In view of application to SAP , it has a shallow presentation unlike its name attached to its cover.It is more of a regular accounting rather than SAP FI/CO Adminstration Book."
4,Combi playyard,"Loved this playpen! It is convenient to have at home and to pick up and take some where or put away. It is very attractive and ""modern"" looking unlike some. The bassinet works great for a newborn so you don't have to bend over and the changing table is wonderful. The vibrater on it just makes a very loud noise, but the music and light are very good features to help a little one fall asleep or help you see in the dark. Another complaint I have is fitting the changing table back into the bag. Usually when I pack it up I don't put that in there because it doesn't fit without a lot of wiggling and then I sometimes still can't get it too fit. The changing table is also not that easy to fold up. The compartments on the side are great for holding diapers and such too! But over all it is a awesome playpen especially for the price!"
2,"okay, but errors abound.","1st few chapter chapters showed promise. Laid out easy to understand. Fireworks chapters are obviously written by someone else and leave alot to be disired. Not very intuitive examples, make you struggle though it, that and missing files from cd dont help. Typo's through out book, and chapter 30 has a bullet point on the first page of the chapter about the topics to be covered on Finding or Preparing a Host Server, but the topic isn't covered in the chapter. Copy Editors sure fell down on the job in this book."
3,Impressed apart from conclusion,"Fleitz does a fine job of describing the atmosphere of the early days of baseball and is usually objective in his treatment of Jackson as a player and as a person. I recommend the book for anyone who is a Jackson affectionado and/or enjoys human drama in a sports context. However, I was very disappointed in the final pages where Fleitz offers his opinion that Jackson wouldn't have cared about the Hall of Fame anyway because he was basically a Southern, good old boy from a poor background who cared only about hanging out with friends and family near the old homeplace. My great uncle worked in those same Greenville, SC cotton mills as a 9-yr old boy for almost no wages but ambition did not die there among the textile looms."
3,G-SPOT REPEAT,This book reminded me so much of G-Spot that I didn't want to finish it. I really enjoyed G-Spot and some parts to Candy Licker but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has read G-Spot.
5,Yes! Just Like G-SPOT,"Yes! This book was just like G-Spot. Excellent! I love reading tales about young girls who get taken down by life, and then get back on their feet and show the world how tough we can really be. Candy Licker had the same type of storyline as G-Spot but a total different story. I loved them both and hope Noire keeps bringing us books just like these. If you loved G-Spot you will definitely love Candy Licker because the stories are alike in a GREAT WAY!"
4,Better the second time around (Actually 3 1/2 stars),"After reading G-Spot I was really excited about Candy Licker. However, if you have read G-Spot you can predict the exact outcome in Noire's second novel.However, despite the similarities CL is a much richer novel and the plot is developed much better. I would recommend skipping G-Spot and going straight to Candy Licker."
1,Not My Type of Erotica,"I understand some readers get turned on about reading about teenage girls having sex with grown men old enough to be their fathers, teens having sex with each other, women having sex with dogs, women having sex with their sisters, and men sticking various objects up a woman's vagina but I do not. This book was okay but all the books by this author seems repetitive. If you want to read real erotica, read Zane. I was more disgusted and disturbed than anything after read this book. The storyline did not make any sense because the girl was more focused on sex than getting out of a bad situation. If this type of stuff is the norm in New York, I will not be traveling there anytime soon or dating any men from New York. Women from New York disgust me."
3,G-Spot Part 2,"I enjoyed the book, but it felt like I was reading G-Spot with different characters. Overall, it was still a good read."
3,Interesting...,"This book was good. This author is an excellent writer. However, I am giving three stars because this book is not original. It too closely resembles the authors other novel G-Spot. If you were to outline both books the outline would be the same. The books are interchangeable, you do not need to read both. I look forward to reading another book by the author in hopes that he/she explores new territory."
2,"Slow, meandering and pointless.","The only positive aspect of Wyrm is Fabi's thoughts on intelligence and sentience. It's a real shame that the plotline spends so much time on the ludicrous RPG/D&D game; a childish one-dimensional Hobitt/Lord of the Rings rip-off. BUUUUUHHH!The characters are also weakly developed. If you are not extremely interested in SF, stay away! Fabi has nothing to offer whatsoever in the technical insight/innovation department either. Trust me, I have a masters degree in the field."
5,"One of the best suspense, sci-fi books out there!","Mark Fabi's ""Wyrm"" is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Using a unique and original story he manages to captivate the reader. The plot is presented in a way that is quite realistic making the novel seem more than a suspense story rather than sci-fi. I loved the fact that although there is a plethora of technical terms used, they are all explained clearly and are easy for the reader to follow. I recommend the book to everyone who has had even a little computer experience and a great sense of adventure!"
5,Cyber classic well worth the read,"This book felt like classics like Snow Crash... Not that the plot, style etc are similar, but in the way computing and technology are intricately wrapped into a thought provoking whole. An awareness of the early days of computing, RPGs, MUDs, bbs's, unix lore and sillicon valley optimism enhance the book throughout. If you are a fan of good SF and cyberpunk, this is a must-read."
3,MUSHing for the Planet!,"Not exactly high literature, and given the rapid rate at which technology progresses, this isn't the greatest book in the world. However, the concept of an AI arising from the Internet is intriguing, and there are some very interesting discussions on the nature of intelligence and sentience, not to mention Shroedinger's Cat, that make the book worth while. If you play (or played in your youth) MUSHes, MOOs, MUCKs, etc. you'll find a few other little gems in there as well. The romance is cheesy and the tech is obsolete. But for a light read it's reasonably entertaining."
4,"Good, Reliable","Does the job, a bit big and clunky but I don't imagine you can get it any smaller. Converts both ways. Easy to use and seemingly indestructible. I am Satisfied"
4,"Not complete, but entertaining","Excellent biography of one of the lesser known founding fathers. Includes his birth in St Croix with ancestral background and proceeds to his death at the hands of Aaron Burr during their duel. Randall refrains from making Hamilton superhuman or flawless, but does center his piece on his contributions to America before, during and after the Revolutionary War. A treat for any Hamilton fan or those looking to become familiar with him."
3,CD skips,"It was a good buy as far as price and everything, however, the CD skips badly and mainly on my favorite song! It plays okay on most of the others. I've tried it in other players and does the same thing. Just not very good quality I presume, hence the cheaper price. Won't be buying anymore CD's from amazon."
4,WWII Video,"I love WWII ""Victory"" Weapons seeing how they are the genesis of our own US Space program. This video has some great footage of them."
1,Look some where else,"Sent these lights back for one reason, no wiring harness. called the comany with poor results."
4,I like this light,"Purchased this light about a 1 1/2 months ago and I like it. It was easy to assemble, it looks like the picture shown so no surprises there. It is a little stiff in the swing arm but I am sure with some use it will free up a little. I can recommend this lamp it is great for the price"
2,Not what I expected,This is actually a very expensive pad of paper rather than a book. It consists of a letter sized pad with a shoddy plastic template. I was hoping for ideas on agility course layouts. What I got was some rudimentary assistance in drawing. Not good.
4,Great Mini-series,"I honestly didn't know how well I'd like Peter Kraus outside of Six Feet Under, but I really enjoyed this little series. It was an interesting idea, and executed very well. Kevin Pollak plays a great villain. I really don't think that you can go wrong"
5,One of the Best mini-series ever!,This is one of the best mini-series I have ever seen! I love it and have watched it repeatedly; The folks at the Sci-Fi Channel have really outdone themselves with this one!
4,If you liked the movie,Find out everything you could hope to know about the making of this great adventure film and the effort it took to make it. Lots of fascinating detail.
5,Beautiful,These bowls are beautiful. They go with everything. They really are perfect for pasta or soup. Great buy!!
3,Okay,I am a 12 year old and i read this book. I think that the ending is a little bit confusing but I kind of get it....
4,Social Security is NOT a dead issue!,"A great read by an informed guy... The Bush administration is still trying to sneak SS ""reform"" under the radar. All it amounts to is a gift to wall street. As always, Conason is on point."
2,Still Dropping...,"First off, I love Sean Young (Bladerunner, Headspace) and John Savage (The Killing Kind). Unfortunately, THE DROP isn't a very engaging movie. The premise sounds interesting enough, it just doesn't play out well. Michael Bondies drives the car from San Francisco to LA, never realizing that he is transporting pure eeeevil in the trunk. Once he arrives at his destination, I was expecting things to really get going. Well, he sits in a parking garage, watching people stroll by, for what seems like an eon. Then, the badguys show up. Hooray! At last, some action! Yep, they run around the parking structure for yet another eternity! Savage acts menacing. Young is semi-mysterious, while looking beautiful. The only problem is that nothing actually happens until the end. I gave this an extra star due to the bizarre atmosphere and the scene where Savage is dealt with..."
3,Inconsistent dimensions,"I agree with the previous reviewer as you have to treat this material as rough stock.The dimensions are not exact and the width of my sheet varied from the front to the back.There are large saw marks on the edges which compound the varying degree of width.Overall, nice product - but needs additional milling to be properly used."
3,Need more help identifying spiritual gifts,"This is a good book to introduce you to spiritual gifts. It has an invaluable discussion of the components that come together to create how you should express your gifts (such as, personal style, passion, seasons of your life, etc.). However, the biggest drawback to this book is it doesn't help you actually identify your gifts. I finished this book still not knowing what my gifts are but did feel I better understand gifts in general."
3,This shouldn't be your only book on this subject.,"I very much enjoyed reading this book (which I actually listened to on CD read by the author). The second half, especially, is hard to put down. I almost regret reading the epilog, which describes what happens to Dr. Cook after his polar exploring is done. Very sad.I would have given this 5 stars, but I did some other research before writing this review. Based on several other sources, there seems to be a number of issues that Henderson does not consider. For whatever reason, he seems to have picked a side in this controversy, and doesn't address some of the material out there that would cast doubt on his conclusions. So while this book is an enjoyable and educational read, it is not an unbiased and thorough summary of the question of who was there first.And by the way, it now seems likely that neither of them were there first."
2,Disappointed,"Like many of the reviewers, I read Urban Shaman and really enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, I devoured the book and had trouble putting it down. But Thunderbird Falls, was a big flop. It really felt that Murphy was wandering all over the place. There were pages and pages devoted to Joanne's journey on the spiritual level. Quite frankly, I found it totally boring. I found myself skimming large portions of this book. I also found the plot with the witch coven to be unbelievable and weak. I couldn't even find it in Joanne's character to get involved with these people.I was really disappointed because I enjoyed Urban Shaman so much, and really think that the character of Joanne Walker is a great one. I do plan on reading the next book. Every author is entitled to a dud now and again. I am hoping that Murphy gets her focus back for the third one!"
2,No love lost!!,"Ok,ok, ok! This story in my opinion is lacking in all aspects of a romance novel. The lost love storyline is what caught my eye because I love those type of stories, but as the story inveils itself, it was not much of a love story. But I am glad I read the story for myself to see just how the book was all about. Many a person had told me that it was not all that good, always be your own judge! I must say they were right, but I'll let you see for yourself!!"
3,"Strange, engaging. worth seeing","This is a film for those fans who are imaginative, creative, and have a hunger for the unusual.Visually this was really excellent--hooray for the DP--the editing, too, was very good. The story was a little weak as was the dialogue,but I liked how the actors handled what they had to work with. Little trouble with sound now and then, but I think we have to plan on sound problems with low-budget films.Loved every minute and will watch it many more times."
4,"So far so good, a bit of work","Installed 4 months ago, so far so good. It was a bit more work than I imagined though. I only replaced the gear not the worm drive portion. Replacing the worm drive requires practically dismantling the entire unit. To replace just the gear I only had to dismantle half the unit!"
4,Found replacement parts in a pinch,"Our garage door failed, I ordered the parts and had it fixed two days later without involving a repair man. It could have been easier to change out these parts and the design is not good or the shaft would not have failed in the first place. However, it is nice to be able to fix this in an hour for $26 worth of parts instead of hanging a new one."
4,It Uses 'Self-Tapping' Screws,"Product worked great and a LOT cheaper than a new unit. :)The instructions weren't crystal clear, (especially the separate sheet explaining which different spacers, washers, etc to use) but not too bad. The parts worked fine and the door is opening and closing like new.Took me about 2 hours total, but some of that was my own goofs here and there and having an older unit than the instructions anticipated (bought way back in 1991).One thing for people to know... the screw holes that people are saying aren't threaded are that way because the screws originally in those holes are 'self-tapping'. So just slowly and firmly start screwing them in and you'll be fine."
4,gear and sprocket replacement,"The kit that I ordered was received promptly, and was exactly as described. The instructions were thorough and complete. I was able to do the repairs without having to remove, or drop down, the whole motor assembly. Being able to do the repairs with it in place probably saved me about an hour. The tricky part is the initial setting of the Full Open Stop, and the Closed stop contacts. Before reinstalling the chain on the gear, I made sure the motor was cycled to the closed stop position and the door was all the way down. Then I locked the chain into the door lock, and then installed the chain on the gear. This worked well for me."
2,Make sure you have chain not belt type,"2 issues: 1 - It was EXTREMELY hard to get some of the parts off of the motor shaft. Taking apart the device was straightforward enough, but this task took forever. Wound up having to use a metal file to smooth the shaft before we could put the new pieces back on. 2 - My machine uses a belt not a chain. The part number seems to be the same, but I saw no warning about this anywhere. Only when we were done did we see that the drive gear on top did not match our belt. We wound up using the old gear assembly and only replacing the internal plastic gear. This meant taking it apart again.It worked in the end, but was MUCH more time consuming than expected."
5,works great,Fast shipping working great so far.exactly what I needed. a lot cheaper then replacing the whole opener unit.probably saved me 300 dollars
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"This is a horrible book and terribly boring! The whole time you are reading this book, you end up wondering what these people were smoking as they were writing these essays. It seems that most of them were under the influence of hallucinogenics when they wrote these essays. In my case, I had to read this book in an introductory graduate information science course, and had no choice but to read it. My advice, do not bother unless you have to."
4,"Carolyn Blackman, congratulations you did it once again !","As similar to her earlier book, ""Negotiating China -Case Studies & Strategies"", this book is peppered with real-life cases studies and comments, in almost every chapter.Although I come from an Asian country; this book, nonetheless has provided me an intimate intricacy for the conduct of doing business in China.In particular, I quite like the 8-pages quick Reference Chart that provides a quick intro on the aspect of Chinese business scene, detailing the Chinese historical background and the recommended strategies to deal with them. The relevant chapter is also provided for quick reference.This is definitely one of the better book from the Down Under. I managed this just within just 1 day !"
5,An absolutely fabulous collection,"of course, every collection is subject to your own opinion of songs that should be included, but this collection I thinkcaptures the best of Billy Joel. Sure there are songs that could be included or songs that could have been left off, but your never going to have ALL of the songs on one CD, so I think this is your best bet. All of the classic Joel songs are included and some bonuses. This is great for someone who has all the albums on record and wants all the hits on cd. plus its 15 dollars cheaper than buying all his greatest hits albums and 20 dollars cheaper than the box set. A great purchase"
4,Great collection of memories,I don;t like all the tracks on this album but there are so many that I do that it is worth having for sure.
4,Lucky Joel!,"This compilation does a good job of gathering the highlights of Billy Joel`s career. As with all anthologies, you can argue about what songs should or shouldn't have been included,but nevertheless a well chosen and thorough collection. The most promising thing is the improved sound quality of these recordings. I really hope Rhino puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is way too expensive.This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!"
4,The Essential Billy Joel,"Yes this is a great collection of songs by Billy Joel. Although, if you have any other volume of his greatest hits, it isn't worth the money. And it's missing a few ""essential"" Billy Joel tunes, such as ""Big Shot"" and ""The Stranger."" If this is to be one of your first Billy Joel albums like it was with me, you should get it. But for a die-hard fan, collect his albums individually."
4,A excellent artist and singer.,This is a new copy I had to get because the part that holds the disk in broke. I have always been a big billy joel fan and this is a great album.
4,"Very good, but not the best Joel compilation around","I'm in complete agreement with the comments made here. This album doesn't add much to the already exhaustive list of Greatest Hits options for non-hardcore Joel fans. Unforgivable is the absence of ""Scenes in an Italian Restaurant."" But it can't be said that this double-album aimed at compiling the best of Joel is bad, as it is impossible to question the quality of his work. Only that you're really better off (if you don't mind paying a little more) getting yourself a copy of the box set 'Complete Hits Collection 1974-1997' which is far more comprehensive (has four CDs), and includes a CD entirely dedicated to live works intercalated with a ""Storytellers""-like explanation of the inspiration/background of some of his songs."
5,THE MAN!,"Joe Rogan is hilarious. Can't wait for the new CD/DVD coming our March 30!!! Should be hilarious. Love him on fear factor, he's definitely a funny dude!!!!"
2,strictly of interest to the historian,"John Taylor may be well worth studying, but this book is not the way to do it. I can't imagine why anyone would think of publishing this book again today. It was probably a great series of writings at the time, but it's long since outlived any usefulness, and it's hardly gained any historical intrigue."
5,Oxygen Sensor for 2000 Audi A4 1.8T,"My Mechanic says always go with Bosch First, and Amazon had the Best Price, and the same Part as the Original. I had to go to the car, and my Mechanic told me where to look for it to see if it Amazon's Part was the same as the Original, and it was or is."
1,well mark up your stove top,I bought the covers because I liked the color but I can not use them until I can find someone to smooth down the the bottom edge as it is very rough and unpainted. I'am very disappointed in them and I may just send them back.
5,A powerful modern classic,"Mythodea a substantial musical work. In 11 movements,it evokes powerful emotions and images, of mythologicaland space fairing proportions.The music itself is enormous. Vangelis has surpassed himself,and the fusion of contemporary with soprano, choir andorchestra is a rare pleasure. Vangelis fans will not bedisappointed, classical buffs take note - he writes thismusic essentially in real time!Although not breaking new ground harmonically, melodically etc.,it is a very original work. Accessibility does not mean lessoriginal or ground breaking. This work is a huge statementon huge issues, in a contemporary context.Above all it is a beautiful work. The singing of Jessye Normanand Kathleen Battle is heaven itself.In case it's not already obvious, I highly recommend this work!"
4,Not the best,"I have bought this album in Germany the day it was released a month ago.I have to admitt to be a little disapointed.The album, which is an opera, is in one piece like his album Mask, which was much better.Although the music is sometimes very beautiful with a symphonic orchestra and choir it get`s very boring after a some time.I got irritated listening to the high female voices.Is this is the new sound Vangelis is going on to?I do hope not!Annyway, for a real Vangelis fan you need to buy this cd but if you are new with his music, do not start with this album.The second track is one of the best on the album, which is typical the Vangelis sound."
3,"Good content, but make sure they all work","We got this as a gift last May for our son't 5th birthday. He enjoys it very much, but the reading (Aladdin) disk seems to need more RAM than the other disks. You must have QuickTime in order to use this product."
2,Disney 3-pack games,"Well, I am very disappointed because 2 out of 3 of these games don't work. We checked our computer settings and memory. We have an iMac OSX and it also runs OS9. Everything should be fine. It is VERY frustrating. I expect Disney products to be easy to use and good quality. But, at the same time I purchase this one, I bought another Disney Preschool 3-pack and NONE of those CD's work! Very confused and very angry. I wish I knew how to fix it."
1,You're Better off Skipping this one,I love Planet Earth and all the BBC nature shows on Blu-Ray but this one is in a league of its own. Really bad. You're better off getting any other program even if you see this one really cheap. The endless interviews are boring beyond belief. The HD nature footage is very sparse.
3,the man who told stories,"The New Yorker used to publish long, long articles. These accounts all have something interesting about them, but they seem about twice as long as need be. It's possible to skim along, pick up the problem, then cut to the diagnosis and move on. The accounts are just too painstakingly slow to actually read through, like they are being told to a not very bright ten year old."
2,A fascinating subject brought down by dull writing.,"Unfortunately for Berton Roueche, the gripping narrative of Oliver Sachs set too high a standard for medical storytellers. After reading four or five of these stories, one can't help but wonder ""where's the beef?"". Not only are the stories themselves rather uninteresting (what's so outstanding about an organ player with a hand ailment?), but Roueche's writing style wipes out the feeble grip the book has on the reader. It doesn't flow; rarely do you find a sentence with more than one simple idea in it; and strangely enough, both he as the narrator and his QUOTED interviewees use exactly the same pizzicatto narrative... In short, rather uninteresting, plagued with ungripping writing and an unexpected amateurish style for such a seasoned author"
2,Very superficial,"I thought that the dialogue of the Avengers was very juvenile; it seemed that Hawkeye, Cap, and Thor didn't like the idea that the JLA were well respected by their world. Rather than trying to solve their problems and work together like adults (as Scarlet Witch intimates), Thor unleashes a savage attack on Superman--and for what purpose? I am looking forward to Supes teaching a little bit of humility to the god of anger and hubris. Perhaps the comic illustrates the one of the common problems we readers experience in the real world: we fight with our fists rather than with our ideas. The storyline is pretty good, I would have liked to see the Martian Manhunter actually intelligently communicate with the Watcher. If I were part of the cast of heroes, I would have seriously questioned the story they were given by these demigods. So much for logic, but the artwork is good, except Aquaman appears with both arms in one scene and with a spear prosthetic limb in another scene--very sloppy."
5,Definitely a Must! My golf game thanks you!,"I have purchased all sorts of training aids in the past 10 years to somehow help my golf game out. I often thought of giving up the game because my lack of balance and flexibility. The Flexible Golfer program really addresses the need for balance and flexibility in the golf swing. After using the program for about 2 weeks, I have noticed a tremendous increase in my driving distance. I am actually hitting the golf ball about 30 yards further over the past few weeks. I have increased my overall golf flexibility and learned to stretch the correct muscles for golf. Thank you The Golf Trainer. You have made my body and golf game a huge improvement. Good golfing."
3,OK for Beginners,As a Pro Trainer I always like to see books aimed at the beginner - as this book is.Its a little light on content - so you will need more to supplement after a week or two.If you are just starting to exercise for golf - you may want to take a look at this one.Joey Atlas - Golfer's Athletic Performance Centerwww.OptimumFlexibilityForGolf.com
4,This is a good book to read to prevent golf injuries.,"Golf can be very stressful on the joints of the body. This is where this book comes in. It shows you how to add flexibility to prevent injury. If the the muscles and joints are stiff, injury is more likely leading to less golf enjoyment. If you really want a great book on golf instruction use the following:The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better by Patrick Leonardi. This book is so different from other golf instruction books because the stuff really helped me to get better. I didn't have to wait a year like other golfing techniques claim in order to adjust for swing changes. Leonardi's book gave me results instantly. Not meant to be bragging but now I hit the driver with more power. I now can get up and down more consistently. I'm also hitting both my long and short irons with much more accuracy. These two books are definite must buys."
4,Fear of caculated violence is not primary in this work,"I read Parker's Silent Joe, and am now working my way back through his books. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for tight plotting and suspense in the unfolding of the looming threat of a serial killer, but for the myriad of conflicting emotions that surround adult relationships, this book gets all stars. Parker consistantly pedestals his female characters, even as he draws their more reprehensible characteristics, a predisposition I cannot understand. I find most provocative his protrayals of men, how they relate to one another, their views of family and their place in their worlds. Several intriguing characters were introduced in this book, and while I am content to let the story of Russ and Izzy rest, I would wish for follow ups on some of the secondary characters, Chet, Marty, Karen."
3,"preposterous story, good story telling","This is my 4th T. Jefferson Parker book. I am reading them in the order they were published.Parker is good at characters, developing them, and throwing in the real thoughts and lack of confidence real people would have if they were in situations where crime has occured near them.What Parker has trouble with is the absolutely preposterous scenerios he puts his characters in. I know it sounds strange, but I believe his characters would say and feel they way they do in his books. I just can't believe anyone could end up in the situations he sticks them in.I'll keep chugging along and finish the rest of his books. I think as at miminum, he has a great vocabulary and uses it well."
5,A nice variety of tunes that showcase Bela's skill,This is one that offers a more classical set of songs and is a good addition to your Bela Fleck collection.
3,Mostly Old News!,"Both the Russians and Americans misunderstood each others' intentions in Afghanistan - the Russians thought the Americans were moving in, and the Americans thought the Russians were marching to the sea. A Communist coup took over the Afghan government, and the Russian Army soon followed to back it up in 1979.America made it a priority to help defeat the Russians (as they had us in Vietnam) - billions of dollars and weapons were poured in. American Stinger missiles turned the tide - they shot down three Russian choppers the first day deployed.The department Soviets left much of the war material, and after leaving the fighting continued - now in the form of a Civil War. The Taliban started with religious students from Pakistan, received important support from Pakistan, and took Kabul in 1996.The last information anyone has about Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan was 12/7/01 in the Tora Bora area."
3,"Yes, you can ""drop"", but you can't ""lift""!","This toy appealed to me because of the compact size, the colors, and details. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do much. The ""drop"" indeed does just that, and little else. I wish it were designed to also pick the cargo up out of the cars, because then it would be great. Even so, for the price, it is worth it -- it adds another little thing on the train table for the trains to visit. Also, it is almost worth the price for the very attractive red cargo and blue cargo car."
1,Bad Vivitar Camera,"The camera is the worse thing ever. All pictures are blurry, pray no one moves in the photo or it will definitely be a blurry picture. What's the use in having the sorry piece of equipment if the pictures come out worthless. I would never recommend nor buy this camera or brand again! The printer on the other hand has not given any problems, yet, it prints just like all printers."
2,Wow. Bad. Really bad like a flat tire...,"Do you remember that SNL skit with Chris Farley about the spoiled milk? The one where he drinks it, gags, nearly vomits and then drinks more? Then he tells his family about how bad it is and they drink it anyway? That's how I feel after having read the poor reviews--but I watched it anyway. I have to say I either have pretty low standards or a really high tolerance for bad movies (I've only ever walked out of two: The Money Pit and Joe vs. the Volcano) but this movie was just FLAT. It was almost weird how lacking it was in...anything. Clair Forlani is not a good actress--sorry, but she just isn't. She gives nothing onscreen but good face."
3,Nice,This is a movie that you would want to watch only once. I love the main actors and the idea of a romance between the cook and the critic was good but it was a little slow to develop. Also the relation with the ex was a bit confusing. I watched it with my sister and we both agreed that it was just a nice movie.
4,Coleman 4-in-1 matress.,The Coleman 4-in-1 Bed was so easy to set up and take down. I was looking for something that was 'high' off the floor. This does the trick just fine. I got it for the Hurricane season in case I have to leave my home -- SO FAR I HAVEN'T had to use it. In case Power is out due to the storm--the Battery operate pump will come in handy.
1,Scratched,I received this yesterday and it came horribly scratched inside of the case. It was unwatchable. We didn't even get to the start menu on the movie due to all of the scratches on the DVD. Sad really as I was really excited to see this movie. But I'm sadly disappointed.
4,A Traveler's Quest,"This story is about a young man named John Harrison, who had sailed out on ship to try and solve the longitude issue. The story is set in England during a dramatic time of era and the captivating illustrations spoke for themselves by setting a mood of that time of era. The illustrator uses water color and distinct texture in his illustrations. At first, I thought the story itself was a little boring because of the choice of font the author used. Unlike most picture books, the first thing you usually notice is how big or bold the font is. I noticed the text had very little fine print and blended into the illustrations. In other words, the text didn't jump out in front of you. Other than that it was a good story, and a great share part of history!"
5,My Favorite Chai Tea,"This is my favorite tea! I love the balance of spices - not too much of anything, not too strong, just nice flavor. Other brands of chai tea seem to be too strong, too bitter, or too much of one spice or another. Lipton Spiced Chai is just right; a nice flavor change from standard tea, Earl Grey, English Breakfast or fruit teas. I've just subscribed to this tea because I have been having a hard time finding it any more, and I drink several cups a day year round. I've tried most of the other brands, but don't like any of them nearly as well. I hope Lipton continues to make this tea!"
3,Misleading Picture,The picture for this product clearly shows three 1lb bags of dog treats. Instead you get three .5oz bags of dog treats. I only ordered this over the Bichon fries because I thought I was getting more weight. The product itself is excellent and they sent a few sample treats. I wish they would change the picture or make it clear in the item description how much you are getting.
4,This is a TRIBUTE to Modest Mouse...,"This CD is different from the others in the ""Pickin' On"" series because it includes vocals. The lyrics are easy to understand; the bluegrass picking is a fun alternative.I love the music of Modest Mouse and enjoy this CD when I'm looking for a lift. Don't buy it if you don't appreciate bluegrass music."
