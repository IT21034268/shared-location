5,A Feather In The Rain,"Mr. Cord has outdone himself with this book. This is a remarkable journey of learning, to accept the greatest loss anyone can bear and how to open up our hearts to a new and brighter love than we could ever imagine. Not only is he a talented actor and horseman but he has a gift to reach into our hearts and souls with his words. Thank you for daring to share so much of yourself with your readers."
3,"Excellent anime, great manga, so why the three star?","I'll tell you: When I got the first collector Eureka 7 pack, it came with a nice, large t-shirt that fit me great, not too tight, great, average size.So, I open up my box, excited for the next shirt... When actually what I pulled out was less of a shirt, and more of a circus tent!Don't get me wrong, I'm not a petite guy, but I'm not HUGE. I'm average. I hope the next shirt fits more like the first.As far as the series goes, it's simple. Everything BONES makes is gold. Period.Emotional impact of FMA+Mecha= great series.Characters, even side characters are fleshed out and likable. Renton's awkward crush is totally identifiable, and exceedingly funny.The whole world is a character, even. SCUBs, trapars, and the sport of lifting make this one of the most interesting and believable worlds in my anime experiences.GET THIS SERIES!"
4,What you expected...,It reads a bit like one of the Master's late Juveniles. I wanted it to go on for a couple of chapters.
5,North End Italian Cookbook,"I have used her cookbooks for 11 years. I have NEVER failed to WOW the recipients of my cooking when I use one of this lady's recipes. I consider hers to be my most valuable cookbooks, full of unique, interesting recipes. The personal comments she gives are very helpful in deciding which recipe to try for a given occasion, she has obviously put her heart into her books. I can't wait for more of her cookbooks to come out!"
2,Export Quality?,"I was in Peru some years ago, and brought back 2 boxes of Coca tea. It was packaged like 100 count boxes of Lipton, (as is the Windsor/Macmate). It was much stronger than the teas I have bought on Amazon, and I wonder if the Export Quality print on the box designates a weaker strength than what is available in country."
5,Good Coca tea,"I prefer the Air-Tight bag presentation, but the paper wraps are very useful when you need to keep some extra in your handbag.Great taste, good kick and no artificial ingredients."
3,one more suggestion,"i was kinda of looking for to opening thiss package as it was recieved almost a month before i arrived back home,to the point thankyou,,the only thing missing is a usb cable,,now mind you i'm learning ,,how am i suppose to sync the pc with the i pod,,please do not laugh,,,good luck"
2,AV cable does not work with 3rd gen nano,"Two stars for the two items that work. Great price for these items, and the home and car charger work fine, but my 3rd gen ipod nano seems to want a plug that goes into the data port instead of the headphone jack to play video on a TV. Hopefully someone will correct me if I'm wrong."
3,doesn't work with 2nd generation iPod,"This product is of okay quality - cheap seeming plastic, but appears to work. However, it does not work with my 2nd generation iPod. The description really ought to list this info..."
1,Cheap quality,"Thought i'd get more for the price they were asking for. Does not even come with a stand...the ball rolls around in the case if someone bumps it... When I first received the package, the product was broken. It took them over a week to replace it and they did not expedite the order although I'm suppose to get 2nd day air through amazon at no charge. Overall experience with this vendor was poor. Think twice before getting this particular product...think even longer if your purchasing from this vendor. Poor customer service skills."
3,Ok Read!,This book started off ok then got better. Every time it would catch my interest then it would fall off again. The authour was kind of all over the place. Its like the book starts off in the middle then comes the beginning of the book by introducing the characters and their history......once you got over that hump the book was fine. Not a bad read!
3,Difficult But Definitely Worth it,The premise of the book is good. The novel is well written. But the women as written by the author come across as bitchy. The only female in the story that acts reasonable and seems to be championed by the writer is a rather submissive Asian woman. I enjoyed the idea of this novel more than the novel itself.
3,A very different sort of book,"This book was an easy listen and held my attention. My only complaint is that it seemed to only brush the surface of the complex emotions boiling beneath. This may not be the fault of the author as this version was abridged and I typically avoid abridgements for this reason (and the fact that I hate to miss anything when listening to a novel).I found it interesting to read a book from the point of view of a character who cannot communicate with others via speech or writing and who has isolated himself from society because of his disability. I thought the characters were realistically written, especially Ryan, the wary child and his self-centered mother and liked the fact that none of these characters were perfect.I still can't figure out why the main character never bothered to learn sign language but then it would have been a different book altogether . . .All in all it was an interesting read."
5,"Throw your ""Bolero"" away. This is better!",I like every song on this CD. Trying to learn Italian to enjoy it more
2,"Sorry, folks: Bocelli is only a lightweight.","I WANTED to like this album, really I did. The problem is that Bocelli simply doesn't have the depth-of-voice that other popular singers (like Domingo, Carreras & Pavarotti) have. If you're looking for soft background music to dinner, this CD is okay. If you're interested in serious musicianship, stick with REAL voices."
5,Magical and heart pounding,"I heard this Con Ti Partrio selection at a wedding just yesterday. In fact it was the processional in place of the traditional Here Comes the Bride! I still get goose bumps..the music and the magical setting of the daytime wedding among giant cypress trees and beside a shallow creek, were memories I will never forget."
5,Fantastic,"I know that many opera professionals dismiss Bocelli as a true singer. I wouldn't know. But the main point is that Mr. Bocelli is turning so many people to this type of music. I used to listen to heavy metal all the time. I can't even comprehend why I thought for a minute they were good singers. I may not know opera, but I know that this cd has totally changed my music preferences."
4,Signore Manilow?,"After spending two weeks listening to this record almost non-stop, I've come to the conclusion that Andrea Bocelli is Italy's answer to Barry Manilow. Like Manilow, Bocelli's music is over-orhestrated, filled with predictable dramatic swells, sentimental and romantic to the point of being schmaltzy, and all of this is laid on top of a driving, insistent beat that is almost as irresistible as rock'n roll. Having said all that, however, I must confess that I love it. I could put Con te Partiro on an endless loop and listen to it for the rest of my life. It makes me think of Italy, the Sopranos, Bellagio ... three of my favorite things! Sometimes schmaltz is good, and Bocelli is as good as it gets."
4,Beautiful Voice!!,"I remember when I first heard The Voice; it was on a television concert that featured him singing with John Miles ""Misere"". It blew me away! I never could remember the name of the song and almost forgot about that television show until I bought this CD. The main reason I bought it was for ""Con Te Partiro"" both his solo and duet version with Sarah Brightman. I was when I heard ""Misere"" again, I instantly remembered the show and the feelings I had the first time around. I LOVE THIS DUET. Some of the others I'm not too crazy about. I prefer the solo version of ""Con Te Partiro"". The emotion he puts into these songs is fantastic. I shake my head when I read about the ""experts"" saying that he's not as good as Pavarotti or Domingo. Personally, I would love to have him produce a CD that contains some of the most well known arias from various operas. I'm sure he'd give them a run for their money!"
2,Not the real thing,"While this is a pleasant enough album of easy listening, Bocelli's voice is actually small and the tone can be a bit dry. He's definitely not a true operatic tenor and presumably needs to rely on studio technology in order to sing some of the songs convincingly. While he does possess some vocal technique, it's still far from satisfactory and he can only be regarded as a recording phenomenan rather than a genuine performer of distinction."
3,Another version,"I purchased this CD because I love the duet of ""Vivo Per Lei"" he did with Helene Segara ( on her CD, ""Coer de Verre""). Unfortunatly, it is better than any song on this CD. Fortunatly, because that version is so great, this CD still has its own merits. I agree that the duet with Sarah Brightman is much better without her. Strange, that recording has a better sound quality than the rest of the CD."
5,"Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em!","I bought three pairs of these sock for myself and three pairs for my wife right before our vacation to japan last year. They were shipped in record time and were exactly what we wanted. These socks are incredibly comfy and provide support all day long. At night, we washed them in the sink with a little shampoo and followed the other care instructions. By morning they were dry as a bone and ready to wear or pack in the bag. They are a great product!"
3,songs,"the blink 182 song is ""i guess this is growing up"". would someone please tell me who sings the song""im having a bad day, so stay out of my way""????"
3,"""not the Ottman we've come to expect""","Director Blair Hayes tries his best with this film, only to be dragged down even more by John Ottman's score...all twenty two cues are so short, two of them are over three minutes a piece, one is four minutes, but the rest are two minutes or less...not what you'd expect from the man who gave us ~ ""Usual Suspects"" (1995)...""The Cable Guy"" (1996)...""Incognito"" (1997)...""Halloween H20"" (1998)...""Lake Placid"" (1999)...""Urban Legends:Final Cut"" (2000), many I hold in high esteem with my ""ever-growing-collection"" of film music....Jake Gyllenhaal plays a young man with an immune system deficiency, his performance is the only good thing about this project...Gyllenhall leaves you with a lasting impression!Total Time: 39:50 on 22 Tracks ~ Varese Sarabande 302-066-283-2 ~ (2001)"
3,Not the Author's Best,"Found this book not up to my expectations after reading other novels by Jeanne Kalogridis. It was difficult to follow with characters' visions/hallucinations(?) and boring at times with excessive details. It did get better half way through. The Devil's Queen and The Borgia Bride were totally engrossing from start to finish. That style of writing is preferable for me. Despite my difficulty with this novel, Kalogridis is a wonderful story teller and I will continue to look forward to her stories."
2,Let down,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I was expecting something more informative in terms of historical reference and contemporary lives, attitudes, beliefs, etc. I found the writing increasingly simplistic and annoying and by the final few chapters was skimming rather than reading the novel, simply to get to the end. If the rituals and practices described in this book were properly researched and accurately described, fine and good, but as something that was supposed to be a picture of 14th Century France, I got no sense of that. It could've been written about any period of history. Not something I'd recommend to other readers."
4,Nice accident,"I bought this CD by accident. I listen to the first 2 songs and decided to get it without knowing what else was coming. I have no regret. It is a very modern mixture of jazz, franco-libano-magrehbian rhytms. It does not sound like any other CD in my collection."
1,too thin,"the pan is too thin comparatively even to a normal pan, not to cast iron pan. Grill ribs are too small. I was not sure if it would leave grill-marks on meat - I sent it back"
4,Not too shabby...,"Though this recording occasionally sides with sterility, enough passion is present from Freni alone to keep it exciting. In my opinion, Freni is spinto enough to handle the role of Tosca here despite not being a dramatic soprano, and her chest voice and highest notes are more than fulfilling. I imagine a Tosca having as fresh a voice as Price in her prime, and Freni has just that. Pavarotti is not my favorite, but he is tolerable here. The other singers are more than sufficiently idiomatic in their roles."
2,Bad sound quality.We,very very bad sound quality I can barely hear the stand up routine I don't know if it's just that particular DVD or that's how it was recorded it's bad sound quality. I'm hoping for a refund or a better DVD.
3,They Didn't Put It All Out There,"Pablo Francisco is a good comedian. However, this DVD is a bit generic in the content until the very end when he brings in his impression work. The payoff was too late after a majority of old and possibly unoriginal material. He should really stick to impressions as it's why I bought the DVD in the 1st place."
1,Long Live The Hellenic Republic,"The gov't of Skopie (FYROM) gives this clown (Mr Borza) money to write books about how Macedonians are not Greek. Sad, truly sad!!"
2,Expired....,"The ink I received was quite expired with 2008 being printed on the cartridge, and now printer won't print again. If you don't mind risking it, the price is cheap, but sometimes you get what you pay for. But it should have been clearly stated since the printer won't let me use it. Mine also didn't come in 'retail' packaging which should be the box, it was just in the foil wrapper.As an update they did promptly remedy the issue by replacing the cartridge quickly, so customer service is a +"
1,Needs an electrician,Not for average DIY. Needs electrician to install.. since rewires bell transformer. NOT PLUG AND PLAY. I returned.
3,"Works, but finish is not as dark as picture.","The finish looks almost black in the picture. In fact it is more brassy. This antique brass is noticeably different from the antique brass of my chandelier, which is mostly black. Nothing wrong with the strengh of the hook, though. Still, I was disappointed because the picture is misleading."
4,It's Absurdly American,"Being only vaguely familiar with 'Bored to Death' and totally unexposed to Mr. Ames' prose, this book was an unexpected joy to read. The novel's central premise is so silly, you can't help but laugh and it works marvelously as a comedic set-up. There's just a ton of humor inherent in having a hoity-toity English-affected manservant named Jeeves tethered to an everyday, overly self-regarding, alcoholic, pseudo-intellectual, middle class Jewish guy from New Jersey! So much fun. Ames' writing is top notch and it moves quickly. It's also interesting in that I think Jeeves might be a metaphor for the comfort alcohol provides to the perplexed narrator. This is a really inventive and enjoyable book!"
4,Fun Read...go for it...,"Once I got into the premise of a youngish, modern man with a butler, I really enjoyed this. Very human."
1,does not stick well and it broke after 5 days,"The sticky part is not strong enough, at slight pressure it separates. After 5 days the clip, the portion where the phone should slide in broke. Useless, went to garbage."
1,"Music Five Stars, recording quality 0 stars.","I bought a copy of this cd at [local store] last month, when I played it in my car, five of the songs were unlistenable because of what sounded like clipping, needless to I was very disappointed, I loved the music, so bought one [on line] hoping that my first CD was just a lemmon. When the new one arrived I was excited to finally be able to listen to this great CD....My excitment turned to dismay when the recording on this one was just as bad. Only one other review mention this problem, this leads me to belive that maybe there is still hope of getting a clean one."
4,mahler fanatic,This symphony is done very well with mahler being interpreted with much grace and feeling. The brass sections do not seem as strong as that found in Bernstein's interpretation.
2,misses the point,"The Mahler first is a lyric symphony, full of songs from the heart. But all Solti can find is the ""big"" Mahler sound, instead of the subtle chamber music that permeates this piece."
5,RCA TV=Awesome,First of all the tv has 720 lines of resolution which is better than 600. Thats all Iwanted to clear up.
3,An interesting but baffling book,"This is a very entertaining book. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of 15th Century Florence, with sheep grazing within the city walls. The author emphasizes that Brunelleschi solved the problem of spanning the Duomo without the use of scaffolding or ""centering"" in a daring, revolutionary way. There's only one problem with the story however: the author never explains what that daring, revolutionary way was exactly, and I am left scratching my head wondering what part of the story I missed. It's possible that we simply don't know how Brunelleschi did it without ""centering"", but if that's the case, the author never says that. I read this book twice in succession trying to understand this central, specific point, but failed to find any explanation anywhere in the text."
4,Needs more plates,"Very well written in colorful prose with lots of footnotes, but needs better illustrations, perhaps a color plate or two. The descriptions of the machinery the artist invented would have benefited from some precise illustrations. Some photos of the Duomo next time, please. Interior, exterior, and some close ups."
4,Concise very interesting,"This story was more than I expected for a book containing fewer than 200 pages. The story revealed architectural elements such as the load and force considerations required in its design and I found the events surrounding its construction intriquing examples of Florentine socio-economic life during the early 1400s. Obstacles such as designing the sophisticated ox-hoist to raise heavy stone to dizzying heights, invasions by the Duke of Milan, the recurring black plague, arbitrary pay cuts in the masons salary and shipping the Domes carrara marble precariously down the Arno river added dimension and depth to understanding the difficulties experienced while constructing the Dome during that era.If you have been to Florence, this fascinating story will encourage you to return and stand in sheer awe at the Dome's architectural brilliance again!"
2,Brunelleschi's Dome,"While initially delighted with the book -- it tells a great story about the personalities and construction -- I finished not really knowing the how the dome was constructed; what made it unique. The book could use more diagrams and explanations of the construction methods and, really, more character development. Given 30 more pages, I would have learned something from the book and known more about the people in 1400 Florence. Instead, using a web search engine for ""brunelleschi's dome construction"" I found my answer from several very good sites."
4,"James Scissom's Review of Ross King's ""Brunelleschi's Dome""","Length:: 10:00 MinsJames Scissom's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Fall 2012 Economics of Entrepreneurship seminar at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
4,Just what I needed on the Dome in Florence,"This slim volume contains a lot of detailed information - both on the construction of the dome, and on the politics and rivalries behind the scenes. It is well presented and makes for an absorbing read.The drawings of the unique hoisting equipment developed by Brunelleschi showed that he was as much an engineer as an architect.I'll be visiting the dome this fall and now have a wealth of information to make my tour more meaningfull."
4,Super-fun; the Perfect Florence Read,"Man I just LOVED this. Perfect for the visit to Florence. And quite a fast and easy read. Who knew it'd be so compelling to follow the rivalries, the pursuit of perfection, and the plain old puzzle solving. How to make that dome stand without supports during construction. So cool and engaging! Surprising the writer brought that to life so well. Grade: A-."
2,Very Disappointing!,"Several reviewers have commented that the book does not really explain how the dome was constructed without a wooden framework to support the bricks while the mortar bonding them together set and cured. I would endorse these comments. The author writes about the ""herring-bone"" configuration of the brickwork (same as everyone else) but I was not able to understand how this would support bricks whose bedding plane lies at a steep angle to the horizontal. One feels that a good diagram would do the trick, but the only diagrams in this book are archaic ones made by Brunelleschi's contemporaries, and are mostly of his hoisting machines. I was especially disappointed by this book because it was referenced in a teaching course as THE EXPLANATION, which it most definitely is not. In my experience, when an author is unable to adequately explain something, it means that he does not really understand it himself!"
3,"Nice, bit I have an issue","I agree with all the positive reviews here, the sounds is nice. I did notive an improvement in the picture with progressive scan with the component cables. I have a JVC 52"" rear projection HDTV. However, there is a glitch in the progressive scan, I'm not sure how to describe it, but it seems to glitch/freeze/spaz for a split second. Not sure what is going on, might be the TV, but progressive scan works fine with my Gamecube."
4,Worth you Money,"This is a great system for the money. The Good: 5 disc changer, 600 watts of power, and reads all my DVDs (at least in the time I've owned it), and it has a mode called Matrix that can turn even monophone sound into 5.1. The Bad: The equalizer only works in Stereo mode (not even with a CD), the DVD player is rather large, and the sound is not as customizable as I would like. The Ugly: The Remote has something to be desired and takes some time to learn the advanced features.I give this 4 stars because its a good system for your money. It plays my well-used DVDs (fingerprints and all) without skipping and is the simplest thing in the world to set up (took me an hour from driving home to playing Lord of the Rings). If your obsessed about the perfect sound, I wouldn't suggest buying this, but it gives great sound at an even better price."
2,Poor sound quality,"I bought this and had to return it because the sound quality is so incredibly poor. True, it's an inexpensive system, so I wasn't expecting anything outstanding, but this is barely one step above portable stereo quality.On the bright side it has all the features one could ask for, including progressive scan picture, five disc capacity, ability to play slideshows from picture CDs, play MP3s, the list goes on.I knew I was in trouble when I had the sound level really low and still got distortion with some of the sound field settings. And there is almost no fine tuning of the sound. No equalizer or tone controls and barely adequate fade and balance controls. Forget about cranking it up. The distortion and hollow base from the subwoofer make the system useless for those action adventure films I got the system for. You get what you pay for."
3,The Everything Reiki Book...,"This book is a pretty good introduction, but it seems more geared for someone who wishes to become a practioner. From the review I read, I thought it would be ok for a general overview of Reiki. Not terrific for the purposes I was looking for."
3,"Not bad, but not weatherproof, either.","This is a perfectly adequate thistle seed feeder, except that rain can and will enter the feeding ports, causing the seed to cake and germinate. Birds won't eat the result.If you purchase this inexpensive feeder, plan to hang it under shelter or to add a rain shield to the top."
5,simply useful!,"These chrome frames allow the license plate to show entirely, and they are easy to install. no flash! no bling! just simple and appropriate."
3,Not really a frame,"This item is just a cheap overlay (too small for a license plate to fit inside), a substitute, to take the place of the dealer's plastic frames. As such, it is just a dress-up item, slim enough not to cover up the state name or motto and the holes line up ok. It doesn't come with screws or caps. I believe it will be a temporary item, as I don't have too much hope it will last long before it starts to corrode. I'll be very surprised if it makes the winter up here in the Northeast. For now it's an improvement, as most people don't take a close look at your plates anyway, especially without a dealer's name on the frame. Too cheap to return, but now with hindsight as to their construction, I would have never bought them in the first place and gone for something more substantial.I will try to remember to update this review, as to its longevity, in a year or sooner."
5,All the songs your child knows from Playhouse on one disc!,"This is a great CD for any child who loves Playhouse Disney with music from Bear, Olie, Stanley, PB&J, Book of Pooh, and Out of the Box. I have to admit that I'm a sucker for the songs on Bear In the Big Blue House...whoever the composer is writes both beautiful and energetic music! As the mom of a 3-year-old who must listen to CD's over and over and over (you get the idea) again, I can honestly say that in addition to your child loving these songs, you will also not tire of this disc as easily as say...Barney!"
5,Thank you Mr. Oglesby,"Mr. Oglesby's book is one men of all ages should read. It is filled with inspiraton, affirmations, and advice in an easy non-preachy style. This is definitely a book that will be cherished, and read, again and again. A great gift for all the men in your life. Thank you Mr. Oglesby for this keeper."
5,Contra,This game is a timeless classic. I still love it after all these years and after all of the improvements in graphics and gaming.
1,Well.....,"She have a beautiful voice but some of her songs are stupid. ""It's ok"" and ""Pienso en ti"" are my favorites but in ""Embrujada por tu amor"" and ""Ya basta"" she sounds silly. ""Mil Besos"" booooooriiiing.. I can't stand ""Cobarde"" it doesn't make any sense. ""Higher""- are u trying to do ""Let's get Loud"" by Jennifer Lopez??. What kind of title is ""Rompe""????. ""Cuanto te quiero""- she sounds like a desperate girl trying to get some.....She can do better than that (i think).She's not an Alanis Morisette. By the way, How old is she 14 ??"
1,Old greed dies hard..,"Despite the fact that the country (not just the right, as in Reagan's case) practically beatified Roosevelt at the time of his death, and also despite the virtually unanimous opinion among historians that he was one on of the three truly great leaders this country has ever had, authors like Flynn just cannot seem to let it go. The anti-FDR/New Deal/Yalta smear brigade, fueled from the beginning by the same 'big money' that ironically caused the Depression in the first place, marches on to its own drummer, preaching to its own choir.If a man is measured by who his enemies were, then the legacy of FDR, only perhaps second to Lincoln, may rest undisputed."
5,Sills is so fantastic! The rest of the cast is great too!,"Sills is marvelous as the lovable gold-digger. The rest of the cast is great as well. The previous reviewer is incorrect in two statements he made. First, no aria of Baby Doe's requires intricate runs. Some require coloratura, but that doesn't include intricate runs. Second, Sills was a perfect vocal fit for the role of Baby Doe. A lyric-coloratura like Swenson or Fleming would not be able to surpass Sills as Baby Doe. Swenson is talented and is getting better. Fleming is getting worse and only wishes she could be half as good as Sills."
2,Grease-Style Wig does not measure up,"This wig did not look anything like the hairstyle that John Travolta wore in Grease. It also did not maintain it's shape after the first try-on and was to be used in a 3x event Lip-Sync production. I am sorry to say it was a waste of $$. So glad I grew my son's hair long, just in case."
5,The best Book Ever,This book was great. the charaters were believeable other than the fact they were from another world. This book is one of the best books i have read. the chapters went together well and the intro strung stuff together.
4,Craftsmanship almost at it's best,"RCA has been in business since the beginning and the RCA F32444 32"" TV is top notch with good picture quality but not the best.And more inputs than you can shake a stick at.This thing took me and another person to lift it onto the self so, It's heavy. It took allot of fiddling around to get the picture just how I want it due to all the options that the menu offered.Just set it up and tune it and your in business. Don't let the gurus tell you RCA is a [sub-standard] brand because they are right up there with the big dogs. I use to work at a TV repair shop and rarely did we see RCAs, It was mostly sonys and such.I just got the TV so that's about all I can tell you at this point. By the way, If your moving up from a smaller TV there is some getting use to a bigger screen to size and a small loss of image quality, This goes for all large screen brands."
1,it doesn't look like one that the photo,"In the photo look like little transparent violet color, but the seller sent me a white color, I dont like it white color. I will not be able to return it because this week was I received that it in Venezuela, and the return shipment is very expensive and troublesome. The next time they must be more careful in which they dispatch"
1,HD52W140 - Potential House Fire,"Check posts on Internet forums before buying. I have had personal experience. Check out the www.hometheaterspot.com RCA GE PROSCAN forum for details. This product series has known problems that RCA has not resolved, despite the apparent number of units failing."
1,Major Problems,"The actual rating is actually a negative-negative star not only for the D52W20 but also for the Thomson customer service. First, the product after 4 months from purchase, the monitor failed. The TV would not turn on and the on/off switch would go through a cycling phase. Sent it to be repaired and found out the HO Transformer is defective. After another 8 months after the repair the same problem occurred with the transformer. I come to find out that this is a well known problem with this model and Thomson thus far refuses to rectify it. Dealing with Thomson customer care is just real bad. Do not buy especially from RCA/Thomson."
1,Worst video ever,"Do not waste your money on this! Whoever reviewed before obviously did not watch it or is getting paid for positive review. It offers nothing. Amateur production, which is also renamed and released under many other names. There is basically nothing that you will get from this except poorer."
2,easy to follow dance steps.,"this video does not really provide detailed steps to follow but the steps are very simple to follow especially for the bachata dance. it has several choices from beginner to intermediate to advance which you can select. this instructional dvd is much better than the ""salsa dance dvd"" they also produced which has very complicated steps for the advance level and which no detailed steps are explained. i have no comments about the reggaeton dance section because i am too old to dance that particular dance and i never watched it anyway."
4,I Really Liked It Alot,"For starters, this young lady knows her craft. This book was very well written & has a good story line. So, I know she will be around for the long haul. Keep up the good work!"
5,Living with Drama!,"A Twisted Tale of Karma is a great book that leaves you on the edge of your seat. This book makes you realize that you are not the only one with drama, because Myra sure had a lot of it, but when you live with Drama there is always a bright side and a happy ending. Leka, Keep on writing girl! Ready for the next one!"
5,A TRUE TWISTED TALE!!!!,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS NOVEL. AMALEKA MCCALL GRABS HER READERS FROM THE FIRST PAGE, WITH HER EXPERT WRITING SKILLS SHE NEVER LETS THE READER DOWN. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!! IN THIS NOVEL YOU WILL MEET MYRA & MILTON THERE LIVES IS A NEVER ENDING BATTLE. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A REASON TO FILP THE PAGE. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ. THE AUTHOR IS VERY TALENTED SOMEONE CALLED HER THE PRINCESS OF CONTEMPORARY/ URBAN FICTION AND I SAY THAT TITLE FITS HER WELL. I CAN'T WAIT TO HER NEXT ONE DROP!!!!!!A NOTE TO AMALEKA :)YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST AND DON'T LET NOONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT. I WANNA BE LIKE YOU WHEN I GROW UP!!!LUV YA,VIRGO:)"
4,Very original!,"I've read every book that Alice Hoffman has ever written, and this one is different, even for her! It has a darker feel than my favorites (Practical Magic, older stuff) but it was a beautifully written book with the feel of a fairy tale."
5,Literary Lightning Strikes,"Alice Hoffman is one of my favorite authors and this book is just another reason why. Her characters are always so well drawn and have such levels of depth and often pain to overcome. And no one does obsession like Hoffman. What I loved about this book was that I was never quite sure where things were headed or how they would end up or even how I wanted things to turn out. This was a great read, Hoffman at her best."
3,Not the Alice Hoffman I'm Used To.,"Being a fan, I was excited to see a new book by Alice Hoffman out and that it was available at the library. This book, however, seemed kind of silly. There were enjoyable parts, but it was an effort to pick the book up and continue many times. Few of the characters or situations interested me very much. I hope first time readers won't judge her work based on this book. Some of my favorites were: Turtle Moon, Practical Magic, Illumination Night, Here on Earth, Second Nature, Seventh Heaven, and At Risk."
1,Vineyard USA failing,"After listening to this project, I've still yet to find any new Vineyard USA songs to use on a Sunday. The production is good but...where is the strong material? The UK and Canada Vineyard writers are mopping up the US as far as great worship.Recently I heard a song through the grapevine that really stands out. It's Chris Lizotte's ""I Will Trust You"" (soon to be released). Now THAT'S a great worship song. Keep getting those tunes out, and things could turn around for the states. Search harder and longer for those great songs! As a worship leader in the Vineyard, I'm finding more excellent material from independent artists like Chris Tomlin. It's a shame..."
5,A great book about a fascinating time,"Though maybe not as well organized as one might like, this book contains much absorbing information on the last days of the First World War. It starts by telling of the False Armistice, then on to the meeting in the Forest, the 72 hours before the signing, the events in Germany, the Kaiser's going to Holland, the signing, the last shots, and the celebrations. There is much poignancy, and little things reduced me to tears. The material is gathered from accounts of people who were there and numerous memoirs and secondary sources. The book also tells of fiction treating the events--for instance, Parade's End, by Ford Madox Ford (which I read 7 Sept 1984 and did not like). This book is an enjoyable book to read about a fantastic time: November 1918."
2,"""Celibacy"" and its allure","""Celibacy"" is first and foremost the unmarried state, particularly the state you're in when you've vowed never to marry. If you're honoring the vow, the presumption is that you are not having sex. Hence the common misunderstanding that ""celibacy"" means abstinence from sex. (And we all know how often that presumption can be wrong.)Stephen McCauley is a talented writer who, presumably, writes books that bring profits to his publisher. You would therefore think he would merit an editor capable of substituting ""abstinence"" for ""celibacy."" (A global search and replace would do.)Otherwise, I agree with many other reviewers: this book is not up to McCauley's previous books. Read one of the latter if you're new to McCauley; otherwise, be prepared for disappointment."
4,Nice page turner,"There's something I find odd about a cleaning obsessive-compulsive who has a thing for random sexual encounters; I feel like the two conflict on some level. But those are just some of the things that makes William a funny guy to follow.I found this novel very entertaining and the lack of in-depth sex details (a good thing!) helped me to keep my attention on the plot. The only thing that seemed a little forced was the need to date the novel a year after 9/11. Aside from a few political jabs at the Bush administration (a good thing!) and Edward's new-found panic attacks, there didn't seem like a need to keep us in 2002. I figured the disaster was what propelled William into his sexual philandering, but that didn't seem like the case either."
2,smells AWFUL,"This seat is very convenient and it's always in our car, but the smell is just really toxic and terrible. i thought it would air out but it's been over a year and it still smells like the inside of a plastics factory. 5 stars for usability, 2 for ""wtf! this is for kids"" .. use better materials!"
5,Exciting historical mystery/adventure,"I was given this book by a young friend who urged me to read it, saying that she thought I would like the real historical setting (Cicero's Rome) and the fact that all the characters but Aulus and his slave had actually lived in ancient Rome. My friend was right -- I thoroughly enjoyed this lively action-filled novel. It is well written, and the characters are empathetic and believable."
5,DELICIOUS SNACK,"I ordered these for my family, although I do not eatgummies since they stick to my teeth & the flavor isgenerally only on the outside.However, I tried one & really loved them! They didnot stick to my teeth & the flavor was greatcompared to non-organic gummy candy.THIS IS AN ORGANIC KEEPER!"
3,Blech!,"These have a rubber-eraser type consistency, and are either pretty flavorless (the red ones) or have an unpleasant taste (the yellow ones) that is NOT reminicent of fruit."
1,Necklace is too sensitive,"We had to return this because the necklace was too sensitive. My elderly mother wore it around her house to do chores, and the police were called twice by the Telemergency, unbeknownst to her until they showed up on her doorstep. I think the necklace kept flipping over and hitting against her skin. They need to make it so that you have to give it a hard press before it starts the dialing process."
3,Once programmed it works as described.,"I am pretty techie and I remember it took some effort to program. Somehow I got it and it worked for the 4 years we used it. I didn't want it calling 911 automatically so I was glad you could turn off that feature.Pros:No monthly feeWorksCons:Hard to ProgramOverall for 2007 this was a decent product, if you are reading this past 2012 there are better products."
1,Very Disappointed,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!I got this for my mother because she is falling a lot now. I sent it as a gift directly to her house. A neighbor helped her install it.IT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED!!! It advertises the range is 100 ft. It barely went into the next room!.I'd like to return it but she threw the box away.The only reason I gave this 1 star is because there are no negative stars.
4,works well but a little complicated,"I think that the telemergency pro-elite 700c with the wireless pendant it a very good product. As long as the person using it is able to know which button to push on the pendant and that the rather confusing directions on how to program the phone numbers can be followed, the machine does what it needs to do. After we were able to set the system up, the machine performed flawlessly. It just takes a little time to set the machine up but I am happy with my purchase."
3,set up not that difficult but...,"after reading the reviews below, i set aside the entire evening to install the thing. ended up taking a couple minutes. that said, i'm nervous that my grandmother will not hold the button long enough to activate. also, the automatic dialing process begins the system gets wonky - strange, unpredictable off-hook behavior."
2,Poor disk materials,"These Families of the World videos are great, educational tools. However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle. I looked at the back and the disk quality is that of a burned disk copy, not the professional grade you expect from a DVD purchase."
4,Gift for god daughter,"This doll is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but it is very cute and good as a small side gift for baptisms and christenings."
4,Birders delight,"Bonnie writes from years of birding trips to Churchill. Other fauna as well as flora are listed. Maps for easy location of sites as well as trail information is listed, including polar bears alerts. Especially useful: front cover graph, by month, of most likely to be seen birds. Up to date town/motel/rentals/tour with addresses/phone numbers is great. Don't count on colored photographs...there are few. Take your favorite North American Birding Guide along with Chartier's to Churchill."
1,One DVD $99.00??????,"After reading about how bad the quality is and the fact that it's one DVD, how can anyone charge $99.00 for it?Is it made of Gold??????I was under the impression The Wonder Years hadn't been released yet."
3,"Content is great, picture quality is poor.","The content of this DVD is great as you'd expect from any episode of the Wonder Years. However, the picture quality is poor. The transfer to DVD was obviously not done with care. Unless you're desperate, stay away from this one..."
2,such a story!!!!!,"this story is rather sad at some points.At one time the Indians had adopted a man's daughter and wouldn't let him see his daughter. That was heartbreaking. They weren't thinking,no one would want you to try to be there parent and you're not espcially if you big enough to know.Also i don't think some of the characters in this story are smart. they will not let their people ransom them.After being captured and forced to march to Canada they disapprove of being what they are and wish to be Indians. Anyway it is a good story if you're sensitive and and cannot bear to read about severe torture. Of course the captives in this story have not been tortured. Instead, they've been adopted into a Mohawk family."
4,Schiff gets at the heart of the music,"These performances are valuable just as are most of Schiff's Bach recordings: they offer an important alternative to Gould's highly idiosyncratic and personal treatments of this music. Schiff manages to uncover all sorts of structural, harmonic, and phrasing nuances that are so important in this music, and which Gould often steamrolls over. Schiff is also technically impressive, possessing a touch which is generally light, though often assertive and forceful. These recordings seem to me to elucidate a good deal more about these pieces than any other recordings available. Get the Gould, but get these first."
2,"Nice, but why so careful and boring?","Many will surely find Schiffs playing to be delightful, and it is, but he seems to be embellishing things to the point when things starts to either fall apart or be plainly boring. These minatures should, to my liking, be played more straightforward, but still keep a springloaded driving momentum they way Gould masters it. Schiff is nevertheless great and does a better job than for instance Hewitt, Sebestyen, Peter Serkin and Martins. Buy both GG and Schiff and you'll have much fun. Try Inventions 5,7,13, 15 and Sinfonias 8, 11, 14 and 15."
1,"Ugly vocals, Keith cuts up the ivory","Generally, I can't stand the vocals on this CD. They are really painful to hear. Without the lead vocal track, it would be an interesting album."
2,Nicolette - Wholesome,"Nicolette, I feel, has always been better as a guest singer than the main attraction, and I fear that this EP only confirms that suspicion. The original of ""Wholesome"" is as pop as blips can go, but her lyrics seem rather wan. Sure, the lady has pipes, but the mix sounds a bit heavy on the treble side, to where her voice can get hurt-y. Filewile strips out most everything in their mix except for the voice, the beat and an electro bass (the Electric Blanket Remix takes the same tack, though they add a melodic line). Elsewhere, Plaid adds in some steel drums for a slightly twitchier mix -- not quite up to their mix of her ""No Government"" years earlier. G. Rina offers a more interest time with ""Groovy,"" sending the Simon & Garfunkel song into a twisty space journey, while ""Stars"" has some dreamy breaks to back it up. Maybe it's all about Nicolette finding the right collaborators."
2,Crummy recording quality,"First track: Gee, this sounds kind of crunchy and distorted. Second track: Gee, this sounds kind of crunch . . .Third track: #@*@&%!Nope, it sure as heck isn't David Holmes . . ."
5,great game,"awesome game, helps memorization. My grandchildren love this game. Only problem is after a few years I can't get it to work again and I decided to go on line and found this site and the problem is it is expensive because I bought mine several years ago for only $1.00 and the Dollar store or Dollar General. I was shocked at the price now."
4,Great product,"We purchased this for a 12 hr road trip that we were taking with our 4 and 1 year olds. It kept them busy and they were even to play with it together in the car. I loved that it was durable and educational. Wish the box was a little more durable, but otherwise a great product."
3,The toy pieces are nice but the tote is not,"Encourages creative play; my 2.5 year olds really enjoy it and have found a number of ways to play with the toys in this tote. The tote is not very sturdy, however, and will soon be worn-out enough to throw away. It's hard for kids to put all the bits back in the tote so that they will fit."
3,It's too basic...,"Got this for my son for an upcoming plane trip. He saw it in box and wanted for me to open it.He is 2 and a half, and he was able to do all the puzzles in the matter of minutes. He was confused why there are so few stacking pegs and peg pads..? So anyway, all he does now with this set is to play like they are some sort of personal collections -- he likes to carry the pieces of puzzles or the pegs with him when he goes around the house. (one of the things toddlers like to do at age 2). The puzzles and pegs are too easy & basic for my son otherwise."
3,i like his flow,yes he does sound too much like pac and what have you not to mention working with the most over-rated rap artist of all-time puffy fluffy.but the man could tell stories and flow on different beats.but like pac vastly overrated.but like pac it's a tragidy cuz it would have been interesting to see what became of him as time went on.
2,Whoops!,"I accidently bought this edited version instead of the explicit version. The songs are pretty good but most of it is edited and about half the album is dropped from the explicit version! If you want this album, don't get this version of it!"
5,"flawless rhymes,bangin beats...only the notorious B.I.G.","One of our lyrical soldiers has passed,but this album +ready to die will keep him alive plus the love we have for the NOTORIOUS B.I.G...HOT album with butters tracks and heavy hittin lyrics makes this album a MASTERPIECE.Rest well B.I.G,we will all meet up with you in another lifetime,The way s#$t is going these days we are not to far behind....."
5,Greatest album from the greatest rapper B.I.G.!,This album is really impressive and the tracks and the whole style of the cd it'sself is original and it's bring to mind on how talwented this young rapper was and how great his words where with every breath he took.You kind of get to know how truely nice and versatile this rapper was and how good he was at his craft and what he did for the music industry itslef with his gold and platinum sale from other singles and albums.It's seems that everything that this rapper made is going to be classic and it's rightfully rightious for it too cause he really does deserve it casue this single is a hot track and i can't keep my cd player to stop playing this bassy and hardedge bumpy dance track as well as harcode track on the single itself.you should get this cd cause you won't be dissapointed and i'm sure you'll eventually start buying up more of his work since he is one of the most requested music rappers ever
5,This album is a classic.,"This is not no Eminem or no Nelly ...... this album is Biggie Smalls. A classic. This album came out, sold very well..... just like B.I.G.'s other albums. But this one is the best.With Bone Thugs N Harmony, Notorious Thugs was a hit. It was the first song i heard from Life After Death. Notorious Thugs was the best hit from this abum, but in my opinon i like Ten Crack Commandments the best.While fliping thrue songs, i heard the beat for it, and it brought my attention. so i stopped and listened to it, and i came out to be one of my favorite songs in the world. This whole album brought my attention. B.I.G. is an influence. He has brobably influenced over 20 rappers. Not just rappers. Any music really. There is about mabey 5 artists the perfect talent.... the perfect voice... and Biggie is one of those artists. I am from the west side, but i still got the same amount of love for east coast. Pleaz listen to this album. R.I.P. Notorious B.I.G."
1,The Pioneer Of What's Wrong With Rap Today,"Don't get me wrong, the first album is a classic, but with this one, it leaves me scratching my head. All this album is, is a recycles Diana Ross, other 70's hits album with mediocre lyrics and tired skits. The production is so sloppy from Puffy, Buckwild and others that it makes me wonder why this album was so cherished in the rap world. It pioneered what's wrong with rap today - money hungry (convicts) using old tracks made new again with dance and party beats. R.I.P. B.I.G., at least you can't make wack music any more."
5,I love this,"I love this album, still listen to it. He was great, very few songs need to be skipped over on this one."
1,disappointing,"Man this CD [is bad]. Too many superficial tracks; Playa Hater, Effin You Tonight, Another. No songs with meaning. Get something different like Makaveli the 7 Day Theory."
2,"Nice Try, Puffy....","Truth be known. BIG was NOT the king of Eastcoast hip-hop as much as he was credited for(or at least never on Puffy's label). The entire label is based on using premade samples from oldschool artists', that's not being original. Not only that, but lyrics lack substance horribly and serve for very little meaning. You can't consider yourself a king of hip-hop if all you're doing is biting off other artists' beats. Perhaps if BIG was under another label with better guidance, be could have easily been a much better artist, perhaps even be alive today."
1,abhorrent,"This CD is maybe worth $3, but certainly not the $22 it sells for in stores or on this site. Out of over 30 songs, it only has three that aren't so incredibly musically devoid that they can be listened to, and of those three one is a rip off of Slick Rick (but what do you expect with Bad Boy) and the second is ruined by the appearance of Puff Daddy. Don't get this."
2,COULD BE BETTER,I purchased these trim mouldings and put them on.I noticed they have small ripples in the finish and are narrower than pictured.I am not pleased with them and would not recomment them.Poor quality but typical for putco
5,Passion's Promise,"I felt the book was excellent!! I did not view the male character as a mama's boy; but loving, considerate, and sensitive to issues regarding his family and his new found love.I can't wait for the next to follow!!"
1,Ooh stick you Daphne and Celeste.......(0 stars for you 2!),"I don't know where to begin critisising this record! It's horrid! These girls obviously can't sing, can't write proper songs, can't be no 1...... I recommend this record to the mentally subnormal! If you love real talent i recommend that you listen to Mariah Carey's Heartbreaker feat Missy Elliot and Da brat."
5,"perfect, idiot-proof, bonus lighting level","Took 2 minutes. Clear instruction, comes with wire-nuts. If it goes several years without burning out, I'll be happy, which it should, since the unit in the lamp burned out after about 12 years.Oh, and you get 4 levels instead of 3, which is nice.***oh, and if your lamp was like mine, don't bother trying to remove the base, which is likely fused to the nut by now, you'll only strip the threads anyway. Just cut the wire and throw an extra nut on the ground.***"
4,"Tiny, works great","This touch lamp kit is tiny and fits my night table lamp with room to spare. My previous touch kit would randomly turn on the lamp when other lights were being switched on. Electrician had no idea why, and I think it was static electricity in the wiring. This problem is now gone with this new touch kit! I would have given it 5 stars if it had 3 light levels instead of 4; it's a bit much."
1,Broken after 3 months of use,"After using this dryer daily for 3 months, it developed a burning smell then stopped working. Not acceptable, especially for a heavy use small appliance such as this."
1,Ink Cartridge NOT working,"I have cleaned the printhead, aligned, and adjusted the linefeed. All to no avail. The ink cartridge will NOT work. It continues to print unreadable text. I have never had this issue with HP ink before, so I am wondering what the issue is."
1,Expired Cartridge!!,While the cartridge was new. It was definitely expired. I received mine on 6/8/2012 and it had expired in 4/2012.Still works but it's very shady for them to sell it as new.
4,Hp 88 Ink,this add was misleading. the picture shows an oem hp ink cartridg but when i got it in the mail it was a refurbished one. i was a little dissapointed about that. on the bright side the ink that i did get is really good quality and works well with my printer.
4,excellent,"I really liked this anime. A lot. Especially the music. It's so... haunting. So of course I had to get my hands on the entire soundtrack. Go get ""Key to Twilight"". Sometimes I just watched the thing to get the music.That's not to downplay the goodness of the anime mind you. It was good. The only thing that made me sad was the open ending of the anime. You have to play the vid game for the entire storyline. And that sucks because as my husband says ""I have no game power."" I had so many game overs I lost my passion for the game. I still don't know how it ends. -sigh-"
3,Could be better .,"Didnt really do much to my lips , it just irritated them .All it does is swell up your lips .3 stars ."
5,Great in combination with lip injection extreme,"I love lip injection extreme, and I bought this to use during the day. It works great to maintain the pout created by extreme, but I don't think it would work as well alone.However, together they are the perfect system. Minimal burning,very moisturizing, great value. Will purchase again."
3,Poor quality brush,"This item does what it says, i.e., plumps your lips, but unfortunately the brush that is used to apply it is of such poor quality that every time I use it, more and more of the brush strands come off and get stuck on my lips . . . not a fun task to remove them:-( For the price, I would have hoped that the manufacturer could have come up with a better brush."
1,waste,This product is a waste of money. It is way to sticky. It burns your lips and does nothing for plumping them.
1,Lip injection lip gloss,I thought that this was a giant waste of money. It did NOTHING for me. Save your money and your time by not buying!
4,Satisfied with pads,"Product arrived timely and in good condition. I have about 7 pads in use so each is laundered approximately once each week. Some fading of print has occured, but otherwise pads are wearing well."
5,The Case That Changed America,I do recommend this book because there is still racism in the United States of America today and many people need to stop because nobody wants to be insulted because of there race. The books plot was how people were treated back in the 1940's and 50's and gave me many reasons why not to be a racist. I would not like to read another book by Chris Crowe again because this book was extremely sad. This book is perfect for people that are trying to improve themselves and are trying to put themselves in someone else's shoes way back when.
4,A good read,Just a good story with a moral to it. You can keep it light or you can look further into it
3,A decent read...,"I picked up this book because it had a pretty cover. Looks can be deceiving...the story line is ok, the people hard to identify with. They are all the same, with the same thoughts and blah blah blah. Ms. Hyde really could have developed them better...and a boy changing the world because of one extra-credit assignment? Get real. Although the idea is a good one, the book could have been written better."
1,Horrible Writing Kills Story,"Pay It Foward could have been a decent book. It really could have. Unfortunately, the only people that enjoy it now are people that aren't completely literate.The writing is bad. There is no other way to say it. Anyone that passed high school english could formulate more coherent sentences. It seems like the author wrote one draft, put it on the fridge for a few days, and had it published. It is poorly put together, the characterization is weak, and even the plot is all over the place.You can tell the people that made the movie thought so too because they changed around the entire story so it would make some sense.Don't bother with the book. It is a waste of paper."
4,"PAY IT FORWARD review, by Nic","PAY IT FORWARD review, by NicPay It Forward, by Catherine Ryan Hyde, is a feel good story with a lot of substance.After being given a class assignment to find a way to change the world, 12 year-old Trevor McKinney creates the ingenious idea of `paying it forward'. He proposes that if he does good deeds for three people, and each of them does the same (and so forth) the world would most certainly change.I like that this story isn't saccharine-sweet. It shows the diverse problems of society as well as the good. I don't want to give too much story-info that might affect the surprises, twists and turns; but make no mistake, they are there!I rarely prefer a movie over a book, but in this case, I felt the movie was just a tad better."
3,"a real ""tweener""","I'm a sucker for utopian, or dystopian, novels. Looking Backwards, Brave New World, 1984, etc. Booksellers see me coming and hang signs out the window with either word. Ok, not really...This is a hard book to get a handle on. It's too mature for the ""young adult novel"" tag but it comes off feeling like one. There are stretches that are real page-turners and others that make you want to move on to your next book. At times I warmed up to the boy who is the main character and at times he seemed too over-the-top sweet/smart: kindof a Dr. Oliver Swift/Mr. Wesley Crusher thing. Overall I give it the nod for an original, clever concept that adds a dollop of hope into the world."
5,Another Noble Act from the Harrison family,"This is such a fine compilation, and for such a needful cause. It was nice to see that not only Olivia Harrison was an organizer, but ALL of the then wives of the former Beatles. That alone makes it noteworthy. The selections are the other noteworthy thing, and add to that the songs that George Harrison played on, makes this a must have for collectors."
2,Great Clock - Terrible Radio,"I've had this clock radio for several years. If you want to self setting clock, buy it. If you want a descent clock radio, keep looking. The self setting clock is fantastic and the dual alarm feature is nice. However the radio is absolutely terrible. It is difficult to tune because the tuning knob is tiny and it is impossible to to see the few station frequency numbers that are printed in tiny numbers on the dial. So you have to guess what station it is on and wait for the station to say its call letters. For some reason the radio will not stay in tune, so every two or three days I have to re tune it. The latest issue is the volume control which is cutting in and out so it is about to go.Life it too short to use something so aggravating so I'm going to replace this with a Sangean WR-2.Also, the sound quality of the Emerson is poor, but I expected that."
1,Buyer Beware,"While the product is terrific - I saw it at a friend's home, the product was never shipped to me by the advertiser."
3,Where's the Manual?,"Nice clock, with large letters. However, there was no manual in the box when I received it. With all of the buttons and options it was quite confusing. Hubby finally found and downloaded a 30-page manual from the Internet. Also, since we live in Arizona and do not go on Daylight Savings Time, it means that we now have to re-set our alarm clock every Fall and Spring. OK, so we're the minority, but there should be an option to turn the automatic DLST feature off."
2,First one was better,I guess it came down to why would I make Oreo cookies when I can buy the real thing? The choices in this book were very basic and not recipes for meals as the first one was. I would not recommend buying it at all.
1,poor replacement strap,"Vougestrap TX16G14 pin holes do not line up with the Casio G Shock DW 5600. Damaged my watch in the process. Now I will purchase a new G Shock with watchband that fits. Voguestrap replacement strap appears to be of appropriate quality, but the quality assurance for fit is not good. My G Shock is definitely worse for the attempt."
1,"not the movie, but a poor documentary","This is not the cheesy, fun blockbuster, but a documentary. Don't buy it as it is poor even for what it is."
3,Seemed too Slow,I have heard this done at a faster tempo and felt this one dragged in spots. It was well sung and I always love Gilbert and Sullivan's work. It included the dialog between the musical Pieces.
3,Robert Shaw/Atlanta Symphony Recording Far Superior to Solti,"Robert Shaw and the Atlanta Symphony recording of The Messiah by Handel is far superior to the Solti recording. Shaw's masterful approach to choral work is remarkable and demonstrates a superior understanding of vocal production. The diction and vowel clarity of Shaw's work with the Atlanta Symphony Chorus is head and shoulders above any recording I have heard to date. Additionally, Sylvia McNair shines as the soprano soloist in the Shaw recording.Although the Solti recording is adequate, is does not compare to the artistry of the choral master, Robert Shaw."
2,One of the worst ones ever,"Unfortunately, this recording can stay on the shelf. The orchestra isn't particularly good, and the soloists leave much to be desired, especially the contralto who has a vibrato that can take paint off of your walls. The chorus, however is quite good. If all you are interested in is the choral sections, this recording is wonderful, but as far as anything else is concerned, you're better off not getting it."
3,Fat Jon & Styrofoam - The Same Channel,"This seems like an odd combination: Styrofoam (known for his more abstract compositions on Morr Music) and Fat Jon (known for his soul-oriented recordings on Mush and Exceptional. When they bump heads on _The Same Channel_, the blend of Styrofoam's melancholy music (as on ""Generic Genes"") with Fat Jon's agile but gruff rapping and matches uneasily. I suppose, overall, the lyrics are the most problematic aspect of the album: both Fat Jon and Styrofoam sound similar on ""Bleed"" and ""Runnin' Circles"" -- tracks that are too alike to warrant being next to each other. There's a bit more romance to Jon's voice on ""Nervous Inaction,"" however, and some sunniness in both of their voices on ""Upgrade."" Jon's beatcrafting, however, proves a good complement to Styrofoam's delicate melodies, the foot-tapping fun of ""Space Gangsta."" And as upbeat as ""Upgrade"" is, the reprise at the end of the album is all moodiness. The results are interesting, if not entirely successful."
2,Perfectly dull,"This CD is a classic example of many of the newer jazz artists; technically very polished, but lacking any real feeling for the music. Dan is an excellent guitarist, and plays single note bebop lines with blinding speed and excellent clarity, but after several listenings, I always come away with the feeling that he sounds like a watered down George Benson. Perhaps given time Dan will develop a unique voice and a deeper feel for jazz - he has plenty of talent, it just needs some development."
5,the only true medium speaks,"I have seen them all--van prage, john edwards and sylvia brown, and NO ONE can compare to the real and true ability that George Anderson has. I saw him recently and had a reading, and he asks you to provide NO information (everyone else needs feedback in order to proceed) and without saying a word, my wife spoke through George to me about things that mattered to me. It was incredible and so is this book. I read the book and it sounded too good to believe. Guess what--his gift is even better in person. God bless this incredible man"
3,Book: lessons from the light.,"I did not like the book, it was not at all what I was expecting. The book was in good condition, but I did not like what it was about. I thought it would be a lot different."
5,GEORGE ANDERSON....AMAZING!,"My sister and I had a reading in the summer of 98 via phone with Mr. Anderson that changed my life. I was very cynical in the belief of life after death since the passing of my mother 4 years ago. I had seen countless psychics and mediums, and none impressed me at all. That is until Mr. Anderson. The only way he could have told us the things he did was if he was truly in communication with my mother, and I have no doubts that she was there.... George Anderson has reaffirmed my belief that there is more to this world and that there is indeed an afterlife. He is much more impressive that James Van Praagh, and I like Mr. Anderson more because he is less showy and has a terrific sense of humor. By all means read this book, it will change your life. If you've lost someone dear, it will comfort you tremendously."
1,I just don't buy it,"I bought the book because of :1. Negative review that one reader made about James van Praagh and at the same time high recommendation for George Anderson2. High reviews from the ""customers"".As much as I had enjoyed reading James' book, I found George's book boring and just don't believe those ""discernments""."
5,EXCELLENT!,Mr.Anderson captures all the emotions a person experiences while going through the loss of a loved one. I found his book captivating and unique just as he is to have been given such a wonderful gift to share with others in pain. I look forward to more inspiring books from him and I consider his books a must read for anyone experiencing the loss of someone they loved.
3,Fun game bad graphics.,"This is a pretty fun game for the classic hand held game system the Gameboy Advance. Although this game is pretty fun, it has pretty bad graphics."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"You should be aware that this film has an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. This mutilated print is pan-and-scan. If you want to pay for only 2/3 of the original film, OK: but you need to know you're being cheated."
2,"Very small, pink stones do not stand out, looks like little gray blob on ear.","I bought these for my mom, she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online, when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment.The entire earring is tiny, the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver, from not very far away at all, they just look like a gray blob, very hard to tell what shape. Not impressed, I suggest you look for something else.I will be returning these immediately"
2,"""If you like John Norman...","...you'll love Sharon Green."" That was the actual blurb on the back of one of the books. And on the whole it's not inaccurate. Yes, by the end of book five the series does ultimately redeem itself from a feminist point of view, but the endless slime one has to slog through in the first four-and-a-half volumes hardly makes it worth the while.On the other hand, if you like the Gor novels, you'll love this series!"
5,IonHub = A+ in my books,"After using the IonHub I am very happy that I took a chance on this product. I have taken 4 power cords that I frequently bring while traveling (MP3 player, blue tooth, cell phone and portable DVD player)down to one. It helps in hotel rooms where electronics out number the electrical outlets and in airports if I want to watch a DVD and charge my cell phone at the same time.I have also used in it my car for long trips so that I can power my Garmin GPS, cell phone and MP3 player all from one car outlet. It's small, light, portable and works. A++"
1,Boo,"I love 5.11 products (except for the price) but I've never found I jacket from them I like. This jacket is cut extremely short and while some people may like that it doesn't account for the super bulkiness. I bought an XL (which all the 3-in-1 jackets I've ever bought or tried on are) and it fit like an XXXL and its length ended at my belly button; not exaggerating. These things are built for 600lb midgets. I tried L and XL with both the 5-in-1 and 3-in-1, same issue. For the price, I expect perfection. I'll stick with North Face for my jackets; if you care the velcro holster made for these jackets still works in my North Face 3-in-1 and that was the main reason I wanted the 5.11 jacket. Functionally these jackets are awesome but I cannot figure out who they are cutting these for."
3,Not quite what I expected,"from the talented arranger Nelson Riddle. I do like this album but I must admit that this is the only time thatI wasn't really blown away by Riddle's music. And as much as I admire Miss Kanawa's talents as a soprano I don't think she really quite pulled it off. But still, compared to the music of today this is still like a breath of fresh air and I am glad I got this album as it fills an important gap in my collection of Mr. Riddle's music. His albums with Linda Ronstadt are much more satisfying but that shouldn't put anyone off from getting this album."
2,This book is 9 chapters long!,"Although, this book is geared toward younger kids, I wouldn't say it's geared toward ""younger readers"". I bought it for my 5 year old (who will be starting kindergarten in the fall) thinking it would be a much simpler book than it was. If you're not intimately familiar with Star Wars, some of the words will be hard for you to pronounce - something to keep in mind since you'll likely be reading this book to your child. My son was very distracted that the colors of Obi-Wan's ship and Boga were WRONG."
5,THE HOTTEST THING SINCE I FEEL LOVE...,"THIS IS THE MOST WONDERFUL SONG DONNA SUMMER HAS DONE SINCE I FEEL LOVE. THE THUNDERPUSS 2000 CLUB MIX IS FABULOUS. IT REALLY SHOWS YOU WHAT A TRUE DIVA IS. SORRY WHITNEY, MARIA AND CELINE - THIS IS A REAL DIVA. DONNA CHER AND LIZA ARE THE REAL THING. AND THE 'I FEEL HEALED' MIX IS FANTASTIC. THE LOVIE IS A HEALER LYRICS FIT PERFECTLY OVER THE I FEEL LOVE MUSIC. THIS IS WONDERFUL. THUNDERPUSS 2000 HAVE BROUGHT OUT THEIR BEST IN THIS ONE."
4,Good Unit,"I thought this unit plan was particularly useful because of its flexibility. You can run the whole plan with a class or take relevant parts of it, as the needs of the class dictate. I highly recommend this product."
1,Dont buy this...rather flush your money down,"I bought this. Worked the first year.Stopped working the second year.Fan runs..but no mist..and i'm out of warranty..If there were lesst one stars, that would be my rating..."
1,No go!,"I owned a previous model ultrasonic humidifier from Holmes which lasted for over five years and just recently stopped working. I liked the product. I decided to purchase this humidifier despite the number of negative revues. Unfortunately, I had a similar problem to others who claimed large amounts of water leaked out. Twice mine leaked much of the water in the tank onto the furniture and floor out of the lower back air inlet. It is not obvious what causes this to happen. I suspect the interior spring valve sometimes sticks.In addition, I agree with the many others who complained about the shape of the top of the tank that MAKES FILLING IT VERY DIFFICULT. This is one of those stupid designs made by marketing for its looks. There is no reason the tank could not be made to stand solid while being filled. I strongly recommend not buying it. Maybe they will get the message eventually."
3,Holmes HM495-UC works well.,Works well. Is very quiet. Wish it did not cause water accumulation when set above mid range. Would recommend buying this unit.
1,Poor quality,"Worked well enough while it worked; although, there were still issues with it. The mist doesn't travel far so it will soak the area around it. It was difficult to seat the reservoir in the base without getting water out. You do get the white powder effect too.We were ok with dealing with the negatives but the whole thing stopped working after just a couple of years, and it was starting to spring leaks even before it stopped working. We won't be purchasing Holmes products again. Very poor quality."
1,One Star Because There Is Nothing LESS Than One Star,"You will regret buying this humidifier!!!!!! After one season, the fan works great, but the heating element which produces the mist went out. This humidifier is now a $50 door stop!"
1,Worked for a year,"Bought this last year and it worked pretty well for last winter. I didn't like that you couldn't adjust the direction the mist went, it just went straight up and fell right back down, making the floor wet around it. Went to set it up this year and it has stopped working. The fan runs, but the ultrasonic plate won't vibrate anymore. I tried cleaning it, taking it apart, everything. I really thought I'd get more than 1 season out of it. Consider this a one season humidifier."
3,It looks good,"I purchased my Holmes humididier two years ago, the first year ever thing was good. This year the mist will not work. The moter works fine. I have tryed to keep it cleaned out at least once a week. I remember the man on HS saying if you have hard water don't worry about it just put a little bleach in the water and it will be ok. Some one called in and ask if it was necessary to use bottle water if your water was hard. He said NO. Well here I am looking for a replacement after just one good year. Just wanted people to know if you have hard water you should use bottle water."
4,"Great singing, little emotion","Birgit tears it up singing the role of Salome, but she sounds the same (which is not a bad thing) throughout. I wanted more a more seductive sound during her scene with John the Baptist, and for someone who was supposed to have come from one sick and twisted household I wanted a more strident sound. Probably the fault of the conducter, Solti, all in all great to listen to."
2,overmike,"I like to listen to an opera with balance between the orchestra and the singers. But the singers are so closely microphoned that I can't see it as being correct.The orchestration is Salome. Nilsson is also Salome. But I find her voice too bright. It is gigantic, but it has the tone of an oversize Roberto Peters. Also her edginess is a bother.I prefer Kirsten Flagstad."
3,Coleman Grill,"The shipping was okay, but was surprised at the actual grill. Not quite what was expected, as it is more like a stove than an outdoor grill. It really wasn't what we wanted, but is working okay. Overall, the Amazon shopping experience was okay."
2,NO,"Mine broke day after two months. Not good for any serious use. My guess is the regulator assembly needs to be replaced, which I'll try to do, but its not a really a real grill. And for $170 you can certainly do better."
5,"Coleman 9941-768 Road Trip Grill, Blue","We received our grill in time for Christmas but just opened the box last week. I must say, assembly was a breeze. So simple to put together. As we have not tried using it yet, we did see exactly how it worked this past August in Maine at a friends BBQ get together and were so impressed, especially with the WATER tray cleanup. After searching all the stores around for miles with no luck, we found Amazon.com had one at a terrific price. We can't wait for warmer weather to come to start BBQing in our back yard. If you want something EASY TO INSTALL, EASY CLEANUP, EASY TO TRAVEL WITH, this is the grill."
5,Great Camping Grill,"This has to be the best grill available. Camping friends have one and we were impressed so ordered one thru Amazon. This grill is fantastic. We put whole wrapped potatoes on the griddle side and they get done faster than in the oven. We also cook onions, squash, jalapenos, asparagus and any vegetable on it. It's so easy. We grill hamburgers, steaks, etc. on the grill. Clean up is easy. I clean it right after using it. I cannot tell you how pleased we are with this grill. The stand folds up and we put it in the bottom of the rv along with the grill. We try to use it every day for it is actually fun using this grill. Well worth the money and I cannot say enough positive things about it."
4,Smart Cookies,"Sandra's mom said she [the mom] was a smart cookie, but she meant it sarcastically, referring to her decision to leave school and get married young. An experienced teacher can always use this book in the classroom."
1,sandalias verdes,"Si bien las sandalias son muy lindas, me encanta su diseño, para usarlas son muy incomodas los nudos se ven por afuera muy bien pero por dentro lastiman el pie. Mi hija de 5 años no aguantó ponerselas mas de 10 minutos."
1,Useless underpad for wheel chair,"Useless! Waste of money. Far too small for use in the power chair. Picture shows that this pad is ""huge""...it isn't. I wish I would have sent it back for repayment!"
4,Children's,"Dean Morrissey does a wonderful job with his visuals and story lines. They tend to be geared more for the older child, but visual pleasing."
3,Almost...,"This disk isn't nearly as good as ""Lemon Parade""....These guys are bound to fade away very soon...Don't pick up this album, even if you want ""you wanted more"", just get the American Pie Soundtrack...."
1,AVOID - DEFECTIVE,"Purchased at the end of summer in 2007 for $500 and less than 6 months later collapsed. found out that warranty is only 6 months and doesn't cover acts of nature...it's outside!!!!! Parts are expensive and couldn't get a hold of the company - took 3 days to get through. I would avoid unless you can get it at a garage sale for a couple bucks...wait, that's a great idea - sell it at my garage sale....."
2,"if you hate the US and men, do i have a book for you","Let me start off by saying this author did a lot of research for this book. That's where my praise will stop. It's 110 pages of boredom. I would rather read a 110 page book on how to properly eat a banana then to read that again. Each page introduces 3 random people in a setting that is never talked about again for the rest of the book. The women followed in this book cleary have communist leanings, and the author goes out of her way to blame men, and the US, for all of the worlds ills. Teachers should not assign this book for college level reading."
4,bike hoist works just fine.,Put up 2 hoists for our bikes.Easy to install and easy to raise and lower the bikes.does the job.Hope the rope doesn't break and let the bike fall on my car.
4,worth the sale price,"I have used a pair of these lifts for about four years and just purchased more for my son. They have served well and are adequately constructed. I have raised and lowered the one that holds the bicycle I use most often several hundred times. I have paid from fifteen to twenty dollars for these lifts, and that seems to me a reasonable price. The fifty dollars asked by some bicycle retailers is not."
4,Amazon RACOR PBH-1R,This bike rack has helped me open up space in the garage. It was easy to install and easy to use. The automatic braking mechanism helps when lifting the bike and makes storing the bike simple.
5,Love it,This product is great; well worth the price. One thing that I would recommend is to place the pull cord on the seat side not the handle bar side as shown in the instructions and the promo pic. The rope gets tangled in the handle bar when trying to activate the locking device. I will definitely tell my friends to purchase.
3,Rope broke,"I've been using this bike lift for months and months with no issues. Yesterday the rope broke when I was lowering the bike. Nobody was hurt and nothing was damaged, but this could have been a bigger problem. The rope showed no sign of wear. The break was clean, as if a knife had cut it. No knife cut it. The rope must have been defective.Crazy"
4,Using for a Kayak,"I currently use this for a kayak that weighs about 45lbs.It works as advertised, the rope frays slightly and may be worth replacing eventually, however it has survived over a years worth of ups and downs of my bi-weekly kayak trips. Well worth 16 bucks."
5,Great space saver,I do not have enough space it my garage. We have 5 bikes and this one help me save space. I've bought two and the bike area becomes smaller so that I have more space for other things.
3,Works Fine,Installed in a few minutes and use it raise and lower the bike every morning. Going to buy 2 more.
4,Racor bike lift,"great product, I started making my own version, then found this one. It's not only cheaper than the one I made but it has a rope lock."
4,Racor Ceiling Mounted Bike Lift #PBH-1R,Great price compared to similar products I found on the web. Easy to install and works as advertized.
5,Racor Meets Expectations,I installed two Racor bike lifts in less than an hour. Both operate smoothly and with little effort. Excellent value.
4,Racor PBH-1R,"The Racor PBH-1R is an economical, well-made bike lift. Our need was to hoist a cargo container and it can sufficiently handle the 30lb+ of current weight. It was easy to install. The medicore materials used (lightweight plastic, etc) may prove to sketchy for constant up and down usage but just a guess since we have had no issues- the price paid made it a good value."
3,"Great episode, slightly flawed presentation.","This is a clever episode from the show's brilliant first season. Private eye Jim Rockford tries to track down a man who may have faked his death to grab a $400,000 insurance claim. James Garner already seemed completely comfortable in the shoes of Rockford, and there's great support from guest star Jill Clayburgh (who manages to look cute in a '70s-style afro).For diehard fans of the series, however, there's a rather egregious cut made of a crucial scene that shows how Jim gets out of a scrape. Viewers who haven't seen the missing footage will find themselves wondering what happened. It seems that MCA Home Video used a syndication print, rather than an original master. In sum, then, five stars for the episode and the visual quality of the print -- but two stars must be subtracted from the overall rating given the editing.""Rockford,"" by the way, is a series that cries out for a comprehensive release in the Columbia House Video Library series."
4,Pass test with both Sybex and Novell Press books,"I bought both the Novell Press and Sybex books for the NetWare 5 update exam and was able to pass the test on the first try. (I always buy a NP and a Sybex book, whenever possible, for each Novell certification test I take.) The Novell Press book was a little better, but if you have any experience with NetWare 5 and TCP/IP, these 2 books will do the job for you."
5,The Booster - an amazing debut,"What a great read, I couldn't set it down. Easy to read and become absorbed in.I related to the characters, I love Bingo and wish I could have metAlain, what a great couple! You feel as if you are a part of their world. Poor Shelly, looking to find love through ""the family"" and what and how did Jillian find herself in that position?I was so happy with the ending and that everything led to it, without itbeing contrived. Ms. Solow did a great job of tying everything together without it falling apart. I just felt sad when the book was over as I just wanted to keep being a part of it."
5,This Guys rocks to the soul!,"No matter what your taste in music Kirk will make you love jazz, especially if you love religious music! Enjoy one of the greatest families of musicians, especially his Uncle Peanut!"
3,Too concise,"This book is far too concise and sparse... for a more comprehensive version try James Huheey or Shriver,Atkins and Langford... definitely not for learning on your own."
4,Pretty good...if you know what you're getting into...,"One must look at this book from the standpoint of the authors. This book is written from a symmetry and point-group standpoint. Having met the authors, I learned that the symmetry and point-group chapter (3?) was written first, then everything thereafter came from that. Also, this was NEVER meant to be a comprehensive textbook. It's designed to be used for a 1 semester course. What is excellent is that the basics are taught really well (the point-group stuff, and the ligand-field theory chapter) and that there are literature references to almost all topics in the book. If you feel like you don't get it, this book faciliates extended learning by pointing the reader to primary resources. If you like learning and have a good prof, this is a good book."
3,Decent textbook,"This book is decent. Definitely more like an encyclopedia than an ordinary textbook, and certainly lacking in the example department. Otherwise, it does the trick!"
1,The worst college chemistry book I have read,"This was the worst college chemistry textbook that I have encountered. I have taken gen chem, organic, analytical, physical, biochem, photochem, and inorganic. This book was poorly written and extremely bland in terms of the pages. The sections of each chapter feel like they should be their own chapter in itself because the authors go on and on and on without stopping. And once you get to the next section, its a blunt start. There's little continuity between sections. Each page has little to offer in terms of supporting diagrams and tables. In addition, the examples given are not explained and consequently do nothing to help the reader's understanding."
2,Not as well rounded as I hoped,"Though I agree with other reviewers about the splendid Narnia book summaries, overall I felt this book was not written in a manner fitting a scholarly book. Nor did it provide provide the well-rounded symbolic interpreation I was hoping for. I'm not saying I could do better (and it did make me ponder several biblical sybolic ideologies) but in general, it seemed the same citations appeared throughout the book -- almost to the point of redundancy -- and book was too focused on biblical themes, not a ""guide thorugh Narnia"" per se. I was hoping for something with more rounded interpretation and meaning of Lewis' world."
4,Covers the basics,This product functions as indicated. Could be a small be better by have a more thorough cable testing feature. As a tone generator is is really helpful when tracing coax as it can pass the tone on the shield and not the center conductor.
5,A Recommended Buy! :-),"This is a really good deck.I received it in four days, shipped in 2.Looks great. The white pips add a sort of conformity. The backs are outstanding. They are pretty much a washed out version of the ""Riderback"" series.2 reveals, top and barcode. Handles awesome. UV500 air flow finishThe sides aren't chipping for me. I don't know how other people use their cards. I use mine for magic, tricks, and flourishes.I strongly recommend buying this deck of cards.Comes with...2 ad cards for ellusionist.52 cards 2 jokerscard boxpamphlet of other ellusionist decksThanks for reading!:)"
1,I got a gaff deck...WHAT THE HECK?!?,"I looked at the title, read the description...and i recieved 2 days later...i was super excited then when i open the package...it was a gaff deck....WHAT THE HECK?!?!..i want a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,too smooth...too mellow,"this cd is too smooth and mellow...this is the perfect cd to put on when you're about go out... and also to listen to in the car ride to the club or the show or the poetry set.fave tracks are ALL OF THEM but esp. ms. badu, india.arie, nelly furtado, eddie jackson (his song is too cute, too fly), lathun and ms. scott remix........you wanna go pick this up if you haven't already....hotep-jd in the chi"
5,"A Great, Quick Read","This was a GREAT CSI: NY read, and I don't even like the show!As always, there were two separate storylines:Mac and Danny are working on the murder of a young teen and both her parents, along with the disappeareance of their young son.Stella and Aidan are working on a case that seems to involve ritualistic murders -- while at the same time, someone is stalking Stella and wants her dead.A great, fast read!"
3,Good ideas for recipes,"I was drawn to Vegan Meals since it was aimed at recipes for just a few people. I am the only vegan in my house, and I found this to be very helpful. It gave me ideas on good, quick meals, as well as what to keep stocked up on in my kitchen and pantry.The downside of this book was that I found the recipes I tried to be kind of unappetizing. And one that I tried (something with potatoes and kale) had the wrong amount of pepper in it, and I ended up ruining all of my work and had no dinner. I think that in the future, I will have to try adding my own touches to the recipes to make them better for myself.The resources in the front and back of this book are very helpful. I found a ton of simple, quick, and delicious meals and snacks to try, many of which I use almost every day. I didn't try all of the recipes, but the few I tried I didn't like. So, I guess it's up to you to venture out and try these; after all, I could just have a weird taste in food."
3,The Panama Canal - A simplistic View,The Panama Canal (49 pages) by Elizabeth Mann is a well written book containing the very basic information about the canal. My disappointment is that the book was set in oversized type and every other page was an illustration. It was interesting and very easy reading. The book would be best suited for a pre-high school student.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM,"I bought this album because of all the hype surrounding They Might Be Giant's involvement in it. The whole CD [is not good]. I just can't get into any of the songs except Darlin' Alison, the TMBG track. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. Download the tracks ... if you must. I can't believe I wasted my money on such a horrible CD. Ugh."
4,So it Goes..,"I was never a huge violent femmes fan, but always respected Gordon's lyrics and music! This is a great cd with exceptional performances by PJ Harvey, Martha Wainwright, and Linda Perry. I especailly like Linda Perry on ""so it goes"", she gives it such a warm quality. Check this cd out!"
2,Advertisement for a love guru,"This had some good shots of naked people, but not enough and really boring to watch. A lot of the dialogue was bland as well. There should have been more sex scenes and older women in this too. They followed a pathetic single guy around and it was boring. He gets propositioned for sex the first day that he is ther by a decent looking woman who says that she likes his penis. Nothing happens that we see, except him crying and the old guru chanting some jive BS about things. Very hippy stupid. Should have been all about sex and nudity and nothing more. should have followed a woman around."
1,Useless,"This is a weak approach to a serious topic. Sufism is a deeply insightful path that requires knowledge. Yet, this book fails to even touch upon the surface of Islamic mysticism. It rather seems like the unintelligible ramblings of someone who knows little to nothing about the path. Save your money. Better spent on other books written by true scholars and philosophers."
5,Sublime!,"This exceptional recording is the best Turandot available. Sutherland and Pavarotti are truely outstanding in the lead roles. Caballe is at her most sublime. If you only buy one recording of Turandot, THIS IS IT!"
4,Great recording- supplement it with the Nilsson,"This is a really good recording. I think Sutherland is wrongly cast but it seems to work in the studio context. Pav sounds great (although only sang this twice live as his voice was too small). To really hear Turandot sung you must try Nilsson, whose voice was obviously vast (BTW: I agree with the comments about Nilsson's pitching which is often all over the palce- listen to her famous Tristan on Deutsche where she sings a quarter note below Windgassen at the start of the duet!!). Corelli is better than Pav on the Molinari Pradelli version, but this one is much better conducted and much better played and the choir does not have those awful screeching sopranos that you hear in the Rome chorus."
5,"The three greatest singers of our time, what can I say?","Boy, the operatic heavens must be overjoy to have this classic. I remember the young Pavarotti for his beautifully sung Calaf. And as the definitive Liu, you have none other then the greatest lyric soprano of her era, Monserrat Caballe. But the biggest surprise is the Turandot of La Stupenda. I know that she never sang the role on stage. But what comes out of my speaker is the most powerful, rich, and secure dramatic soprano I've heard from any Turandot, including Marton and Nilsson.This is an underrated Puccini opera with the most magnificent music and the most difficult vocal writings. But with the team of Sutherland, Pavarotti, Caballe, and Zubin Mehta at the podium, how can you go wrong? OH, and before I forget, this Turandot also has the best stereophonic sound that even rivals some of my audiophile demonstration recordings.The essential Turandot, in my opinion. No real opera collection should be without it."
2,Too much hype,"I do not understand all the hype about this set. No doubt the media have fueled the Pavarotti fire. However, the tenor from Modena will return to his actual size after you have listened to Franco Corelli in the EMI set. Enough said about Sutherland as Turandot -beautiful voice, but fish out of water. Caballe is at her prime here, though, raising my rating to a grand total of 2 stars instead of 1. Go get Nilsson/Molinari-Pradelli's !!"
2,A horrid soprano in the title role!!!,"Nilsson is the ultimate Turandot. Her voice is a hydrogen bomb dropping on a nuclear power plant. Sutherland's weak, anemic voice is a disgrace to all other recorded Turandots. Sutherland should take up needlepoint."
1,Only hype....,"What is so good about this? Sutherland's diction and phrasing is the WORST ever. This is NOT Italian but some mushy bla bla! Also, she lacks the laser-like power of Nilsson and the dramatic perfection of Callas. Pavarotti is a Nemorino who wants to be Calaf, Manrico, Radames and such. A LYRIC pretending to be a spinto! Caballe saves the recording with a sublime Liu and yet she is NOTHING compared to Olivero, Vishnevskaya ETC. Why anyone would prefer this over the live-recording with Nilsson, Corelli and Vishnevskaya is a mystery.....!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"The Facts Of Life,Great Pairing of Legends,Nice Buicks,somewhat funny,bad subject matter/a little immoral.","Bob Hope and Lucy are Hilarious,I was looking forward to this on Netflix but found that sometimes the film was not always funny.A Bit long and drawn out,the Buick hardtop and Buick Roadster are beautiful(I prefer the Black Buick hardtop.)Lucy is wonderful but not at her best.I don't like the story and the immorality but plausible seeing how opposite they are,not one of the best movies but overall enjoyable."
2,"Disappointed in ""Facts of Life""","Not your typical Hope-Ball movie re: laughs. Film is drawnout & without many laughs. If you need a fix for a Hope-Ball movie, try something else besides this."
3,Gets your feet not your heart moving,"After reading a British review of Wonderland, I was certain that the latest release would be a continuation of the brilliance of Us and Us Only. Wonderland is a good record, but not as genuine and from the heart as its predecessors. Us and Us Only continues to grow on me, but this record is very surface value (as is most electronica) and I do not anticipate listening to it for more than 6 months. Tim's Curtis Mayfield style vocals are a kind of novelty and work within the context of this record, but novelty is not a word I want to associate with one of my favorite bands. The Charlatans need to take a leave of absense from their Chemical brothers. Write pure rock n' roll songs and leave remixing to the DJs. Although,the beats on this record are pretty damn funky."
4,Book was Excellent,The book was in excellent condition. However it didn't arrive on time. Overall I like the service I got from this buyer and will continue to buy from this buyer.
3,It was alright,"After the first book Wifey the book just drags, i really didnt expect the ending, but it was just alright. i only bought it becausse it was a sequel. and it makes no sense on reading the first book and not finish it..."
5,Works and nice size,"Took this to the top of the Grand Teton and it worked just fine. I wish I can picked up a chapstick size as well, this is a little large to carry around all the time, but for a major trip this works very well because it can be used to protect nose, cheeks, ears, neck, etc. Great stuff!"
2,not the best soccer game,"Fifa soccer games are better then this...but this one sucks compared to the other soccer games!let me tell you the problems:graphics are horrible,announcer sounds like a fag,and gameplay is kinda bad.The good things are:controls are easy to learn,and i rented this game(thank god) so you should rent this game first trust me!"
4,Change Of Formula Following The Series,"Having read the previous books in this series (He Said Yes, He Said No) I was expecting the same format. The man meets a woman, pursues her and falls in love with her, she runs away and he finds her and marries her. He Said Now however did not go this way--Fitch learns he impregnated a woman 9 years earlier and after the mother perishes, he wants to give his daughter a normal life. He becomes intrigued with her guardian, Hilary, and to remedy the situation he marries her. They fall in love and in this book she gets pregnant within the story of the book unlike in the other novels we find out characters get pregnant. It's a quick read and the author's voice improves since her writing has more meaning."
2,Timid tiltings,"2 1/2Poorly produced, fizzled out bass-centric rock fusion suffers from dated collaborations attempting to appease multiple demographics and fulfilling none of them."
3,Doesn't fit older model doors.,"I unfortunately require an obsolete model replacement that fits into a slotted door, these are only available directly from Germany. Not too pleased."
2,Dissappointed,Instructions are poor and the last step puts the shine with a thin film of oil or something to look like your nails are polished.Wash your hands after and the shine goes away.
4,A lovely Rigoletto,"This recording is a classic and very beautiful. The highlights are definitely Pavarotti's vivacious duke and Milnes' Rigoletto. This is the best Duke Pavarotti ever recorded and even though he's lacking the sunny charm of di Stefano (The Duke on the legendary Callas-Recording) he sings the role incredibly well. Milnes was still great in those years, he sounded far better in Puccini and Verdi than in Belcanto. Of course he doesn't dig in as deeply as the unsurpassed Tito Gobbi (Truly the greatest Rigoletto of all time) but he definitely deserves his fame. Bravo Milnes! As for Sutherland, I think her earlier Gilda is better, by far. Here Sutherland sounds too matronly for a girl, also her middle has already this veiled, mushy sound. Still great singing but her ""Caro nome"" on ""The Art of the Primadonna"" outshines this easily. Not the best Rigoletto there is but a good one. Don't miss it AND the set with Tito Gobbi and the sublime Gilda of Maria Callas. Both are great."
3,Fun Game for All ages,This was a great game for all ages. Played over the holidays with school aged kids and relatives 80 & 90 years old. Everyone enjoyed the game. The one spin spot - Uno was a little challenging but we just adjusted the rules so the elderly could follow more easily.
5,its great but don't take my word for it,"I will save you my opinion on this one rather report on the playing of the Concertgebow.That orchestra is known to show their cold side when the conductor or soloist is less than convincing.This is one of their most ""explosive"" recordings I have ever heard."
1,wrong episodes in description!,i bought this dvd thinking the episodes listed are the ones on the DVD. I was wrong.this single disc includes episodes 6 7 8 and 9. not 10-18 like the product listing says.there is a gap of 9 episodes between volume 2 (this listing) and volume 3 which is now very expensive due to bandai not exporting anime anymore. all in all this listing is incorrect and you should not purchase gurren lagann vol 2 unless you want episodes 6-9.
4,good but not the best...,"This album is ok. but is not better than ""episode""(1996),""visions""(1997) and ""Destiny""(1998),songs like ""hunting high and low"",""a millon light years away"", and ""infinity"" are the best in this album.""celestial dream"",""freedom"",""glory of the world"",""mother gaia"" are nice.""millennium"" is not very good song,just the keyboard is amazing.""phoenix"" is just ok."
5,Gospel Goes Classical,"I had been wanting to order this CD for sometime as I was so excited to see these two performers come together. I was so excited when it arrived as promised,"
4,"Superlative composer-led performances, but not an entirely original composer's voice","The Lyrita catalog is back and this can now be found for normal prices, under its other entry:Alwyn: Symphonies 2, 3 & 5. See my review thereunder - and don't let yourself be ripped off by the internet vultures!"
3,"Moderately grainy, but decent","The 24 cards are as follows: all 12 from Les Mois (The Months) - Mois artistique et litterare (1898); Topaze of the Precious Stones series; Femme a la Plume (Woman with a Quill); Le Crepuscule (Dusk); Fleur de cerisier (Cherry Blossom); Exposition de 1900 (Exhibition 1900); Dessin pour un eventail (Design for a Fan); L'enfance (Childhood); Dessin pour un programme (Design for a program); 4 Moet et Chandon Menus.Overall, I was disappointed in the color clarity - Topaze and the Moet et Chandon menus seemed over-saturated and Fleur de cerisier seemed too light. All the prints are on the grainy side, as well - I would venture to say my color printer would do as well. I wouldn't say these cards are of framing quality, as I had originally hoped, but they are perfectly suited for sharing your love of Mucha with friends by mail."
1,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this tool from a friend and used it a total of three times. It is not efficient and it is a pain to use. The automatic feed is a good idea in theory, but in reality the bump and feed is the way to go. I would recommend taking the time to learn how to use the traditional bump and feed trimmer because in the long run, you will save yourself money and prevent the stress caused by the automatic feed's poor design. Also, I am not a fan of corded landscaping tools. I'm a service member living in Germany and I have to use a 1500 watt transformer just to use this weedeater. Additionally, I dislike the limitations of an extension cord. The cord limits my range and I am constantly forced to navigate around obstacles in my yard. I would much rather be able to be free to move about without having to worry whether I will knick the extension cord, costing myself more money and frustration to maintain a tool that doesn't perform well in the first place."
5,A brilliant effort,"Miller, generally considered the best young female criminologist in North America, has won several awards for this book. While there is some information from her dissertation in this, it is far from a published dissertation. Rather it is a breakthrough study in gender studies, and is absolutely essential reading for those in the field working with both girls and boys on the streets."
2,Not applicable to most girls in gangs,"This book is, in large part, a result of the author's dissertation. In an attempt to try to get something published and/or tenure, she compiled descriptive information about gangs in St. Louis and Columbus. While it may be interesting to a few in academia, this book offers no practical value to the gang problems we face everyday. Nor can it be applied to prevention/intervention programs in other locales."
4,Best of what I could find,"For years I used a brush with bristles all around and one side cut shorter for a stiffer scrubbing surface, but I can't find them anymore. I ordered every dish brush I could find with 360 bristles and this was the best. One irritating thing is the handle comes unscrewed every few minutes. Maybe it's a feature to use the spring for flexibility, but I haven't found how to control it.PROS: replaceable heads for less waste, 360 degree bristles, stiff bristles but not too stiffCONS: handle loosens too easily, washing something hot squashes the bristles permanently"
4,Pretty bendable but wish it were better...,The bristles are soft and it is pretty good on your wine glasses and on a decanter which isn't too tall or too wide. It may be hard to get some angles and I worry the metal rings may scratch the glass. We'll see how it works long term.
2,tHE DEAD YARD,THE BOOK WAS GOOD BUT i HAD TWO DISK 7's AND NO DISK 3. I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO SEND IT BACK YET. BUT I WILL SO I CAN ENJOY THE TOTAL BOOKwILLIAM lOWERY
5,Omg...,"So it's different. For sure from the first book this one is... i dunno, a little less internal if that makes sense? If you haven't read the first one: do so immediately it's brilliant, but also you'll still be able to basically get this book. This book is somehow sweet and yet dark! I really wanted to caps lock 'dark' but it's not like hideously disturbing it's just like: wow! reread. yeah, that just happened. adrian mckinty is basically a genius that writes such intricate detailed stories and i'm really diggin him currently, i could not put this book down. the story is great, the characters are so incredibly real, and again i said this about the last book but you will NOT forget this book ever."
3,flimsy,Not sturdy or rugged. It does not hold its shape. True to size but you can get a better one at walmart for cheap.
4,white hot,"Flux was my first foray into hard sci-fi, and it was not what I expected. I had tried to read a few others in the genre, but was turned off by the textbook-like narratives and lifeless characters, but Baxter does a great job of combining the science behind the lives he has created within a solar body with the humanity of a race of intelligent beings clinging to the layers of their world. I can honestly say that I was captivated by this story, and enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,A voice that cuts deeper than the night,"The lady I drooled over in Grease is still tops with me many years later. Olivia Newton-John will forever be engraved in the hearts of many with her beautiful-soothing voice. This CD covers the spectrum from her early innocent years as a country singer to the pop-goddess of the early 80's. For the casual fan, I advise her earlier work and post-Grease stuff. Only good stuff here."
3,Good but not the best,"I've been a long time fan of Olivia's and was very anxious in hearing ""Magic-Very Best of Olivia Newton-John"" CD. The cd contains most of her hits from the 70's all the way up to the late 80's but it's very similar to her ""Back to Basics"" album, which was released back in 1992 and that I enjoyed very much. Over 50% of the songs in ""Magic"" are in ""Back to Basics"", not to mention that ""Back"" contains newer releases.I do recommend ""Magic"" but I feel fans will surely enjoy the ""Back to Basics"" cd more."
2,"go for Callas, L.price or Caballe","For the maximum in emotional expressiveness go for Callas, L. Price or Caballe.Richard Tucker with Caballe is at his best. It is on Opera d'Oro.As others expressed- Sutherland is an incredible singer,just not this repertoire."
3,MEH...,"The movies themselves deserve more than 5 stars, however, the quality of the disk is lacking a bit. I haven't watched the Spaceballs feature, but I watched the special features and they worked just fine. The Men in Tights though, did not work as well. It skipped... a lot. I checked the disk over and over, and its clean as can be, so I'm not sure what the problem is, unless it's just a quality issue. I'm definitly sad about it and am just hoping Spaceballs will play without any problems."
3,"Fun, but no frills","This is a fun game, but not very deep. All of the modes of play are more or less the same, and the ""extreme"" versions of the alleys are not much different then the normal ones. The actual bowling is simple and easy to learn, though. If you like these type of games and don't need a lot of extras, this one is worth a try."
4,Well worth reading,"A competently written, understated, detailed account by a nurse assigned to the first military hospital in Vietnam. Interesting not only because her tour was early, but because Hovis was a Navy nurse."
2,Boring and too late,"Sutherland was the greatest soprano of the last 35 years. Her singing in the sixties and seventies show her miraculous voice. But this one doesn't. Get another Sonnambula. To comprehend Sutherland's greatness: Get her ""The art of the primadonna""!!"
4,A useful book on time-triggered techniques,"I found this book very useful. Despite the general title, Hermann Kopetz is mainly concerned with time-triggered techniques. This approach is becoming increasing popular with developers of real-time systems because it has been found to result in very predictable system behavior and, hence, can help to improve system reliability. This book was one of the first to be published in this area. It provides a considerable amount of useful information."
2,Poor courd set up on back will drive you crazy!,These are very nice and easy to install in window but the cords on the backgo through little plastic rings that then slip into ring holders on the back ofthe shade. When you put the shades up and down the rings come out of the holdersand the whole shade falls down. I had to finally use gorilla glue to glue therings into the holders and forbid anyone but me to put them up or down. Poordesign. But look good.
5,Very dark and gritty police crime drama,"I just finished reading this book last night and I am blown away by thisbook series. Each book is better than the last one and continues to buildon the story and the tension. The world Peace has created in this seriesis full of predators and victims but seems to be devoid of any heroes.There is one line on page 246 of the book that just breaks my heart;""and they say there is no greater pain than to remember in our present griefpast happiness but e will tell you the greatest pain is to remember in ourpresent grief past grief and only grief""I will be reading book four in the series directly and I will be reading allof David Peace's work that I can get my hands on!"
1,What the heck?,This is a terrible video. The drawing is amateurish. The animation is cheap. The English voice-over actors are pretty good. The writing is grade school quality. The storyline is faulty. There is even communist propaganda buried in the series! This is not an artistic work but rather a job demanded by a bookkeeper to make money and nothing more.
3,"It is good, but not so good!","I took the CPA exam on November 2000. This book helped me in some topics such as auditing, federal taxes (individual) and the theory of financial accounting and reporting. But, It lacks of exhibits and any good example that can help you to develop what you learned or to maximize the understanding. Some topics are covered too slightly. I had to complement it with the Wiley Review Outline and study guide. I took also a coaching and I found many discrepancies with this book and what was taught in the coaching, specially in commercial law. It is that, a study outline, do not base all your study on it."
2,A Lemon,"We bought two of these. My husband likes his, but mine skips quite often - and the on/off button broke off within a week! I'd avoid it. Who knows how long it will be before my husband's falls apart?"
5,Perfect Size for School Lunches!!,"I buy these to put in my son's lunch box. He loves them and they are a great, healthy, tasty, low-fat snack! I originally purchased these for my son's Pirate Birthday Party to go along with the theme. They have been a hit for our family ever since. We buy them every time it's our turn to bring a team snack, too!!"
5,snackville,"We purchased this product at a local supermarket previously,but found the only size available was a larger size we did not care for. This provided us with the opportunity to obtain smaller packages.050oz,which is ideal for us. The produce was shipped and received as indicated, and we just ordered our secount box."
3,"Classic album, mediocre tab","This is one of my favorite so of course I was happy when this book came out. But the tabs are (sometimes very) inaccurate, particularly in giving chord voicings which is an integral part of the sound. If you can, you're better off if you also track down Corgan's guitar magazine interviews from this period. They have Corgan's own instructions which of course are much more accurate."
3,Getting Children to Talk,"When it is time for straightforward talk with your children this book will help. It is hard to talk to your children about adult issues especially when you have some guilt. I would also recommend, 'Dear Judge,' (Children's letters to the judge). Read and spend as much time with your children as possible."
3,An Important Historical Document,"Once upon a time there was no Internet as we know it. The public got its information from the news media who in turn often got much of their information from press kits. This book and its companion volume are raw, unfiltered and uncommented reprints of the NASA press kits produced to provide background information to the media.When you see old videotape of Walter Cronkite or Frank Reynolds reporting on the Apollo mission 11 as it happened, chances are an original copy of these press kits is just off camera.The quality of the type and line drawings are crude by today's standards but that only adds to their charm and historical accuracy.I bought both volumes as a present for a space-buff friend of mine and I'm sure he'll be thrilled. I read both cover to cover before wrapping them but I didn't want to break the seal on the CD-ROMs so I can't comment on them."
1,Bufflalo Boring!!!!,"I hated this book!!!! It's just about 2 kids and they wonder from place to place. This book is about Jack and Annie who go to the native times. It's not that interesting. But the series is that they just have to point to the book cover and say "" I wish we could go there"". Then the tree house teleports to the same place. There is a woman named Morgan who sends them there to find things like ( the four M's. Or 4 gifts). Then of course there going to find it and return home but....... when they come home time hasn't changed a bit. They go home and sleep. If you want to read the worst book ever in the world pick up this book today and you'll hate it. But if you want a good book then pick up "" Magic Tree House #32"" or anyother book in the ""30's""."
3,Recall of semicircular toy bars,"I think this bouncer may have been recalled. I found the recall on the web by looking up ""bouncer recall"". The recall is for Kids II Bouncers with the semi-circular soft toy bar. It doesn't apply to ones with rectangular toy bar. Seems to be this one, but check for yourself just in case I'm wrong."
1,Might like it if we could USE it,"Bought the ABC and Green Eggs and Ham cds (they came as a set). Could not load GE&H on my hubby's laptop (running XP) without hanging, so we tried my desktop (running Vista). It loaded, and runs, but continues to hang on occasion. ABC is worse; we can't get past the letter B before it hangs. Both computers have more then enough RAM, OS are listed as compatible, etc. It gets one star 'cause we can run GE&H most of the time, and my 3 1/2 yr old LURVES it."
2,Disappointing.,"The description led us to believe that the game was much more interactive than it actually was. Our almost 6 year old was bored with it the first time she played it. The game reads the words on the screen and has limited opportunities to click on the screen for other words to appear. There were no options for reading each section and then having confirmation, practicing how to spell, etc. Overall, a waste of our money."
3,Magnify select parts,"Another semi-successful release from post-glory days, Magnification can still clue listeners into the lumbering giants these players once were when not shmaltzing it up in over-arranged new age sentiment."
1,What's the fuss about??,"I really don't know why everyone seems to be raving about this album. A group of old guys cashing in on a once highly regarded band yet again. Hey guys, buy a banjo and sit out on the porch and relax. Quite a tiresome release to say the least."
3,"Good, but not as good as The Ladder","This is a good album, but I really think The Ladder was an outstanding album. I like the title song and I like the orchestra, but I still wish they would rock a little harder. There are a couple of times on the album where they come so close to a harder sound (once on Magnification and I can't remember the other)."
3,"Their best in years, but not quite a masterpiece","(3 and 1/2 stars) The big news here is first that Magnification contains some of Yes's best work in many years -- not saying a lot considering the past few CDs, but this new one is a solid effort. Songs such ""Give Love Each Day"" have the complexity and wondrous expansiveness of the early days, while other songs (""Don't Go,"") have the sparkle of the 90125 material. Second, there's the substitution of orchestra for keyboards, an interesting experiment but ultimately an uneasy marriage that works better on some cuts than others. Steve Howe's guitar work throughout the CD is magnificent, as is Chris Squire's sinewy bass playing. I have a feeling I will get more from this disc each time I listen to it, but I don't know if I'll ever completely appreciate the presence of the orchestra."
4,Yes - in 5.1 surround...!,"First came scratchy mono vinyl discs. They evolved slowly into the pristine digitally recorded stereo CD's we enjoy now. If the greedy folks at the RIAA and major labels can keep their hands out of the cookie jar long enough I can see DVD-A and surround mixes becoming the next standard.I'm certainly prejudiced, but I think prog is an ideal showcase for this medium. I already had ""Magnification"" on CD but the difference between the CD and the DVD-A is like the difference between stereo and mono. Amazon.com's reasonable price and the bonus material are just... well, a bonus. This is a welcome addition to my music collection and my first audio DVD."
4,For the thinking vampire fan,"If you're a fan of Tanith Lee, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, or Anne Rice -- & especially if you also appreciate excellent dark verse -- this dual-author collection is for you. These tales & poems emphasize vampire psychology/philosophy rather than simple bloodlust, & are better crafted than much mainstream horror. This is an exotic reading experience for those who prefer stylish Gothic atmosphere & imaginative approaches to vampirism."
4,Engaging mystery,I thought the story was much better developed than the first in the series. Recommend starting with this one. Very engaging mystery
1,I hated it!,"As a child, I remember the adults listening to Brother Dave and howling with laughter. In a moment of nostalgia, I ordered 3 CDs-Brother Dave, Jerry Clower and Andy Griffith. Andy was even funnier than I remembered. Jerry was great. I found Dave Gardner's racist ""humor"" to be very offensive. So much so, that I threw the CD away. I was ashamed that I'd ordered it and embarrased at the thought of someone seeing it in my home."
4,Good,"These headphones have the comfort of a pair of $250 Bose headphones, but the sound of your basic Sony headphones. I highly recommend these headphones if your are looking for some very comfortable headphones great for internet surfing.. If you are looking for better bass and sound but with some comfort I'd go for the Sennheiser HD 205s or other Sennheisers."
3,Low Volume & Rather Large Size Compared To Other Headphones,"I have to agree with the person that gave one star and said the sound is really low. I compared to 2 other headphones i have and the volume is at least half of what the other two were. i was looking around for a volume knob, but there isn't any.the sound is fine, but you've got to jack them WAY up to be anywhere as loud as any other headphone i've tried.I've also noticed that (and i've got a fairly average sized head) these things could have stood to be a little tighter on my head, but they were as small as i could make them.You could certainly get worse headphones, but i think you could also get better headphones for the price. I think i picked up the ATH-PRO5V for around the same price a while back."
2,not what I expected,It delivers an ok sound.I was expecting a fair amount on noise cancellation unfortunately this headphone does not possess the capability. overall great for listening to certain genres.
2,Not worhty,"the material is not good quality, hard on the ear, sound quality is not good. I do not recommend this product."
2,Meh.,I own a Sony MDR V6 and purchased this as a gift for someone to use as an upgrade from using a regular earphone. I tried them on and was disappointed at the quality of the sound and the quality of the material. It doesn't adjust to the head very well and is barely an upgrade from iPhone earphones. I was expecting something similar to the Sony but was not impressed and returned the item.
4,Used For Recording,"I use these to record bands and such and they are plenty loud and dont distort at a high volume (im sure they would if you really turned it up on my firepod/firebox. At least for live recording and play back i find these to be more then enough. It really separates the highs and mids so you can get a good rough mix just from your head phones if you need to. Great for the price, and for doing home recordings."
3,failed reprise,"Flowers tries to transplant the model that worked so well in 'Crash' to this petty small-minded drama... and fails. The failure IMO encompasses several levels. A multi-plot drama like this requires super-precise script-writing, something that clearly did not happen in Haven. There is also a need for a larger, dramatic connecting thread - and the petty brutality and sordidness depicted in Haven did little to illuminate the superposition of greed, lust, inexperience, hierarchy, friendship and love (not to mention alcohlism and drugs) that rule the expat universe.The movie lacked DEFINITION, a certain inner conviction and consistency. It is a pale reflection of the tight brilliance of Crash, which now seems to have been ... a shooting star."
2,Ashkenazy at his worst.,"Listening to this performance is not unlike drinking diluted wine. You get the basic idea of what you are supposed to be hearing but everything is slow, the piano sounds harsh, and the melodies are played weakly. Just compare Askenazy's performance of the first movements cadenza to Rachmaninoff's own recording. Rachmaninoff is exiting, and he takes off toward the end like a rocket. When the flute comes in it is magical. Askenazy on the other hand plays slowly, and feebly. The base octaves near the end of the cadenza hardly sound. However, because of the slow speed it is easier to hear some details that might not be noticed at a faster speed. The only real highlight of this recording is the exellent sound quality."
4,Good,I liked the story. Scott was so easy to like. Maggie was also nice but it was not as easy to see why Scott fell in love with her. The ghosts were okay but I thought that they took away from the book.
1,It Was Terrible,"This Christmas I recieved this CD, and I popped it in the CD player in europe and I thought, ""Oh no! The european CD players completely messed up my cd!"" I have always thought that the cd player [messed] up the cd, mixing backrounds from songs together, and slowing it down, until now. Now, after visiting Amazon.com, I found out that I wasn't the only one with this problem. Then I realized that the title of the album wasn't ""All Mixed up,"" but it was ""The Whole Shebang."" I do NOT suggest buying the ""all mixed up"" because all it is is really weird versions of the songs from the original albums."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I listened to this cd in a music store earlier today and I was completely disappointed. I have the original Whole Shebang cd, which I listened to nonstop for the longest time. I couldn't stand to listen to the first 30 seconds of this one. So I decided to flip through the tracks to see if I could find one song I liked. Didn't happen. All's they did to change the songs was to add special effects, which made it sound space-age-like. And unlike the first cd, which had a good beat to each of the songs, this one was lacking. It would be impossible to sing along or even tap your foot along with this music. I think this cd was just an attempt to make money without having to come up with anything new. Very disappointed, ladies. And to all of you thinking about buying this cd, take my advice, stick with the original."
2,An appropriate title...,"Ladies, you dropped the ball on this one...There are very few remixes on this album that actually ""work"". They've taken a good album, taken its songs, and put them in a blender. The result is many of the original songs with music that doesn't suit their basic theme - the upbeat ""Before Me and You"" is not far more dark and played in a minor key, same with ""Dancing With Angels"". ""A Night To Remember"" isn't gritty or grisly anymore, ""Punishment"" is too hokey and twangy to be believable. Then there are the songs that are almost indistinguishable from the original. ""I will...But"" is an interesting remix. For the most part, it sounds as if the vocal track was simply lifted from the original song and played to different music. The lyrics and melodies don't really fit in the new remixes, many sounding as if the original album is being covered by a Seattle garage/grunge band, others with a certain ""No Doubt"" sound to them...All in all, the remixes need to be rethought."
1,Carl Craig ruined it,"It gets 1 star since there is no ZERO star. To be playing 'Kano - It's a war' and saying ""this goes out to those that hate war"" and a bit later ""no more bush"", I think he crossed the line mixing politics into the music I love. In fact, he talks through the whole mix. If he had shut up and focused on mixing, the mix could have perhaps come out better, but instead his mixing was poor, messy...awful. The music selection is really awesome, but Carl Craig's mixing trainwrecks plus his stupid Mcing just ruined it for me. I wished I had saved my money on this one."
2,Not too good,"Roswell:Cover-ups and Close Encounters is not the best UFO documentary out there. It is a bit good, but some stuff isn't. Let's start with the music. Good music, although it is louder than the voices of Jonothan Frakes, or anyone that was interviewed, so you have to listen closely. The re-enactments:were pretty good, although hardly in the show. The video of Pheonix lights at the end: best part of it all. It was a very credible video. I would only reccomend it to anyone very, very, VERY interested in UFOs."
2,Bad power connection.,Broke after only a few weeks.The metal connections where you plug the power cord into had bent which no longer allowed for the power to flow through it. I tried to bend it back into shape but ended up snapping it. I may solder the cord directly to the board if I feel energetic. Until then I'm going to try an RCA.The video also was not very great. The signal broke up a lot. I hadn't realized it was because of the modulator until I replaced it with a new one.
5,Great teaching aid.,"I teach Russian immigrants the English language for Grace Family Church in Carmichael California. I use this book and had my students use the reverse: Learn English the fast and fun way. The CD makes my job very easy. We have gone through the book three times, and each time I commend the author Thomas Beyer. There is a lot of humor in the conversations. Vocabulary is absorbed without effort. Any student of the Russian language would benefit from this book."
1,Poor Quality,"This unit is very poor quality. The metals are weak. The saw guide is made of pot-metal and broke the first time I used it. I found it impossible to cut a straight cut through meat. The Manual gives no manufacturer name or origin or phone number or means of replacing any parts. It looks pretty good, and is cheap, which makes it available to common people, but it really isn't worth the money. The Manual doesn't even tell the length of the saw blade so you can find a replacement. Something for post-industrial age third-world America. Junk! I'm only now finding on internet that it comes from Buffalo Tools, whoever they are. It is understandable why they don't put their name on the unit."
1,Dont do it,I got my com switch hoping to finally be able to use my fax without a bunch of messing around. Not the case. The switch does not work as advertised. I spent hours trying different configurations with no luck. My business partner has the same switch and his works fine. The company no longer exists to support it. I don't know if my unit is defective or just a rip off. Dont waste your time and money like i did. I am out the ~$250 I spent.
4,This album is pretty good..however,"I bet no one knows where Snoop got the hook from on the ""That's that"" song?Pull out your old ""Coming to America"" movie and turn to the beginning where Eddie murphy is getting a bath by his servants. Now you know we are getting desperate, when we go back and pick up old movies clips for new music.But I really like the song, and since music is my major, the first time I heard this song, I knew exactly where to go, cause I knew it was not a original.I thought that this was OK and entertaining for me, however I would not buy this for my children"
4,pretty solid effort,"An improvement over his 2 past releases. Producers include, Dr. Dre, Battlecat, Rick Rock, Timbaland, Nottz, The Neptunes, and more. There are a lot of guest appearances too. Guests include Nate Dogg, R. Kelly, B-Real, E-40, Damian Marley, Jamie Foxx, and more. Overall this is a pretty solid effort."
3,AVERAGE,"IT WAS ALRIGHT, NOTHING FANCY. I LUV SNOOP AND THIS ALBUM IS AVERAGE TO SAY THE LEAST. MAYBE 6 SONGS I LIKE, OUT OF 23 OR HOWEVER MANY, ITS A LOT. BUT HONESTLY SNOOP IS FALLING OFF, HE NEED TO GET BACK WITH DRE CAUSE THE BEATS, MOSTLY ARE WACK, LYRICALLY ALL HE TALKS ABOUT ARE HOES AND MONEY, SOME GANGBANGING UP IN THERE, BUT DAMN, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. NOTHING REALLY GOOD TO RIDE 2, SOME SONGS ARE DECENT, BUT WITHIN 20 MINUTES, I'VE HEARD ALL THE SONGS I LIKE AND ON TO THE NEXT CD. IF U ARE A SNOOP FAN, ITS WORTH THE LISTEN, HONESTLY I WOULD GET IT FROM MY LOCAL BOOTLEG MAN, NOT WORTH ALL THE MONEY"
2,Early Adams novel is disappointing,"""Familes and Survivors"" is Alice Adams's second novel, and it shows. The story follows two childhood best friends, and expands to include other couples that they meet along the way. There is a lot of sex happening in the novel. Adultery, and remarriage happen. The characters are flat and boring. The narrator is way too neurotic, and needs a slap to the face."
1,Inaccurate product description,"Be aware, When I ordered the item the description read: "" With INCLUDED attachments..."" THERE ARE NO ATTACHMENTS EXCEPT THE STRING TRIMMER!!! Don't expect the edger, tiller, etc. Somehow I wasn't surprised, but still this was false advertising on Amozon's part."
1,"avoid magellan products, buy Garmin","I have owned two Magellan GPS units, one for my car and one for my boat. Now I use Garmin products. There are two issues with Magellan: they are hard to set up and their customer service is TERRIBLE! Even with a supposed Warranty, dealing with them is a nightmare!"
1,Bad.,"I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled. After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad. I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one. If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star. Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad."
1,awful bars! an unpleasant attempt!,"i received the package early tonight and it was finely packed. despite that, these bars taste awful! I bet the chocolate cover is of the worst quality - no better than crewing wax; not even mention the god-knows-what that fills in it! how can it rank the first among all nutrition bars! i really want to rate it with no star if it's allowed!"
1,Tastes like cardboard.,The product has very little white chocolate and tastes like cardboard. I tasted one bar and threw the other nine out.
4,yummy!,"We've tried many different thinkThin bars and the white chocolate chip bars are the best! They can be a bit rich, but I really like the taste and texture. The best part is that they don't make my blood sugar spike and then drop, so these make a great snack and excellent lunch on days that I don't have time to stop and eat."
5,A wonderful product!,"This is absolutely the best-tasting and most balanced protein bar on the market!Yummy, creamy White Chocolate, gluten-free, sometimes only $1 per bar. Try it!"
3,Mediocre taste,"There are too many great tasting, high protein foods out there to settle. Most of the thinkThin bars taste terrific, but this flavor is mediocre at best."
3,Think Thin White Chocolate,"The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like this. I like the variety of flavors these bars come in and the convenience. The high protein makes it a good snack to tide me over until I can eat a meal. But it takes me 45 minutes to eat an entire bar because it is so sweet. I think I will stick to more natural snacks. I would buy these again though if they were on sale. I do appreciate the many products out there for people like me with celiac."
3,High in Protein,This is a high protein bar with a good flavor. I was only disappointed of the high content of sugar alcohol. I use it to satisfy my sweet tooth when dieting.
3,Zany!,"Interesting, to say the least. Also a little on the nutty side. Makes for interesting reading. Great for animal lovers.Enjoyed it on my Amazon Kindle Fire."
3,Well written but not hilarious...,"I am an animal lover. I was excited when everyone wrote that this book was laugh out loud funny. It was well written and insightful, but not hilarious. The pages kept turning but not enthralling."
4,Fun with animals,A light-hearted book about living with a menagerie of animals. Don't know how they put up with the shenanigans of the birds and animals. A fun read!
2,A lot of complaining.,"I love heartwarming animal stories, but this one struck me cold. It was a lot of negativity about caring for all those animals without the charm."
2,wordy!,I found this book way too wordy! I am an avid reader but mostly I just want to hear the story. I dont consider it a contest on how many words you can use to say something. I was bored about 1/2 way through it & didnt finish.
3,Interesting,"Bob Tarte has a wonderfull sense of humor and a great writing style. I really loved some of the stories. However, I was bored by the end of the book. At first I enjoyed the stories of how another animal was acquired but then I tired of it. I am more of a dog person. I guess I real ""bird & bunny"" type person would love this book."
3,A little dissappointed,"It's a cute story and I enjoyed his writing style, however, I just could not relate to having that many pets.. made me think his house is probably, how do I say.... not very clean."
3,Enslaved by Ducks,"Bob Tarte is an accomplished humorist. However, I found the chapters repetitive and also left me wondering,Who are these people and when do they find time to do anything other than obsess over their various birds?"
2,For animal lover? Not really.,"So many reviewers gushed praise over this book. Saying that anyone who loved animals would love it. Well...I love animals and I found it deeply troubling. A person who loves animals, wants them to be cared for by competent stewards which the author is definitely not. The author and his girlfriend purchase wild captured birds. This may have been legal at one time, but it was never a favored practice among those who care about animals. The author accounts his lack of knowledge about caring for animals. This is not funny. It is sad. The animals certainly deserve better than that. Readers deserve better than this. I could not finish this book."
3,It really is about ducks!,I found this story to be a chronological history of his duck/pet collection. There were few meaningful moments and one is left to wonder why his wife wanted so many pets. Understanding the motivations behind allowing their lives to be controlled by their pets would have been helpful.
1,dont waste your time,i have never encountered such terrible quality from a so called shop bought dvd it was very fuzzy in fact i have seen clearer pirate copies of dvds compared to this. the actual 'production'looks as though it was made in the 80's but has been copied to dvd to make it more up to date. the level of fitness required to take part in this is not an issue someone in traction could do it! it appears to me that she has filmed it in her front room and asked her friend to video it i have home family shot videos with better technique. i am very disapointed in this dvd it was a total waste of time and money i just hope others will read this before being cought out by purchasing it. now i find i cant return it just to add insult to injury
4,prelief is relief,This product is natural and has really helped with my urinary symptoms as well as my acid reflux!
2,It won't help if acidic foods don't exacerbate your IC,"This might be obvious, but if, like me, acidic foods don't cause or worsen your bladder pain, this product won't make a difference. Just make sure you've tried the IC (low-acid) diet and know it mitigates your symptoms before you buy this product."
3,Could have been better,"I remember most of these machines when they were new, and had hoped for a few more of them. I did enjoy what there was, but it leaves you wishing there had been more."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"This book is an excellent reference for the true, pure form of yoga. It is something you come back to again and again, and mark up for future reference. I highly recommend it!"
5,superb ! excpet couple of chapters,"superb book!postives:1. insights into everything it coverschess world, inights into a chess parent2. smooth reading3. the suspense in the last chapter itself is worth 5 starts4. honest expressions about his feelings and his ideasabout others5. the expression of the dilemma within him (or any chessparent) on where this is headed.negative:1. couple of chapters seemed boring (irrelevant) at times,but that could be me looking to get ahead with storyof him and his prodigal son."
5,Poulan Pro 6.5 HP rear prop. variable speed mower,I purchased this mower in Aug. of 2007. I finished the rest of the mowing season with it. It is really great. It is not heavy to operate. I have a yardman rear propelled mower with variable speed that is very heavy to operate. I like this mower so much better and I paid about $100 less for it. It listed at $480 and I purchased it for $250. I paid $350 for the yardman and don't like it nearly as well. The only thing I don't like about it is the cheap plastic discharge chute they put on a $480 mower. It doesn't stay on. It comes off all the time. Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase. I mow about 1/2 acre that isn't flat and I don't get tired with this mower like I did the yardman. I don't have to fill up the gas tank as often with this mower either. I would recommend this mower to anyone. I have been mowing grass for about 10 years and it is one of the better mowers I have used.
5,Sutherland is exquisite as Elvira,I love this recording and would recommend it to everyone who loves opera.
5,Styrdy and good looking,"This tea kettle is big, good looking and works well. I find the dome shape interesting and unique. The handle is comfortable and riveted well to the body. The ""Healthy"" in the name is meaningless; it just means that tea is a healthy drink."
4,Pleasantly lightweight handle,"Unlike similar units I've seem at those 'giant home stores', this one does NOT have a massive handle that makes it unnecessarily heavy. So it's good for camping/backpacking...for digging a tent trench, etc. I'm not certain why the ones at the 'giant home stores' need to be so heavy...this item intended for 'dirt'...not for breaking-up concrete."
1,Poor Quaility and customer service.,"This modem has some sort of problem, I am on my second defective modem. I returned the first to the store, and the second I sent directly to D-link. My cable supplier (Cox) told me they have found many of these modems to be defective. Nether one of them ever worked, they were both defective right out of the box. After sending the second one back at My expense, I am being told it will be at least 15 days after they received it before a new one will ship. I was told this after being on hold for over an hour and already waiting 2 weeks."
2,Not a good investment,"This cable modem stopped working in just 7 monthes. I bought it in February, 2010. It gave me lots of trouble starting in July- I kept having to unplug it, wait 10 or more seconds, and plug it back in to get it to function. Then in August it stopped working altogether. I replaced it with a Motorola Surfboard cable modem, and now I am good to go. I should've spent the extra $20 for the Motorola in the first place."
4,Reset every time you turn off your computer,"This product works great--as long as you leave your computer on continuously. Every time I turn my computer off, I have to restart the modem. No big deal--just annoying. Why wouldn't they test for something as simple as this?"
2,Not supported by Cox,"Not good for P2P, locks up frequently. Is not supported by Cox Communications any longer."
1,"Kept Disconnecting, Avoid this modem","I upgraded from DCM-201, bad move. This modem was hell trying to get it to sync with the Internet provider. I returned the modem and exchanged it and the problem was still there. They had to send a technician out here. Once it got going it kept disconnecting during downloads. Also during downloads this modem got really hot. I returned it for a refund.Avoid this modem."
4,Not so bad,"I updated firmware for using COMCAST cable.If you use Windows XP SP2, you have to stop firewall.Because DLink FTP Server cannot send Hitr252.bin file to cable modem.I wasted an hour to find this problem.Also Login ID is not ""admin/hitron"". (PDF manual was wrong)You should use ""dlink/dlink"" for web login.It works fine. That's it."
1,BAD!!! Support,"I bought this product several weeks before, and the technical guy in the store gave a upgrade disk, and since I have been upgrading this kinds of profucts all the time, so I just went home and try to upgrade it, but I was not successful, so I called the Dlink support, it's apprently in india, and the technical support knew nothing, and in bad attitude. But finally I found that u can not upgrade this product with cable connected. Anyway, my point is, if a company want customer to like their product, pay attention to the technical support. It's understandable to save money by hiring india people, but at least train them and make them responsible."
3,We'll see...,"I hope this review isn't too early. So far it hasn't been that effective. It's been a couple of weeks. Of course, it's not being put on soil, it's being put on the kitchen floor surrounding our cat food bowls. Perhaps that's the problem. But, it did arrive on time, just like I ordered."
3,Great product,"I used this in my garden with pretty good results for the first half of the season BEFORE insects were coming in by the thousands, now nothing on earth can fix that problem. I read you can also take this as a supplement but you should read up on that before swallowing it. It works best dry and should be reapplied after rain or watering. It works to cut insects' bodies up to dehydrate and kill them, so water softens the Diatomaceous Earth, therefore needing to be reapplied. Avoid getting it on your skin, you'll feel dry! It's easy to use, safe, and a fantastic alternative to chemicals."
3,Im not sure,I bought this for a natural way to rid my cat of fleas. Still has them even with dusting her every few days. And I keep doing it because other reviews were so firm and convincing that it does work. I have a flea comb so I am aware of just what is on her. That said. One lbs is a lot of product! This stuff would last me forever. I like the idea of buying the 50lbs and duster and dusting your yard.
3,A Very Disappointing Butterfly,"Everthing about this recording is wonderful, you could not ask for any better voices in the world. However, Herbert Von Karajan, whose work I love, at this point in his illustrious career thought that slower was better. And to me, his tempos completely destroy the vitality of this wonderful work. It is not sad or tragic, it's just ponderous."
4,Don't fill up ahead of time.,"This worked for me just fine. Don't fill it up ahead of time or fill it with much more fluid than you'll use in a day. The fluid evaporates out of it real fast when not using it, thus wasting the fuel. Some suggest putting it in a sealed sandwich bag after you put it out to slow the evaporation down a little."
5,It has cured my ailments!,"I, like most people, bought the tape & didn't touch it for several months. I did finally when I had a major migrane complete with stomach pain, etc. By the time I was done, unbelievably, I was fine. No symptoms & I felt great other then a little tired from normal exercise. Even though all this, I still did not use it again until I was very dizzy from a flu. Again, I was cured of the dizziness, but of course not the flu. I didn't expect a total miracle. I contined to use it during my flu & I fel more energized/better each time. It does take effort & like most, I can shy away from that. It was hard to at first to complete the warm-up and the 8 moves, but it's worth it. Definitly don't stop after starting the moves. Returning the Chi is VERY important or you might just feel tired. Take small breaks in between like I did. I'm going to buy all her other ones since this has worked so well. I am always so calm afterwards."
3,Not Ninja Material.,"If your into martial arts, and think this video is going to turn you into a Ninja with the death touch, your gonna be disappointed. It shows some exercises you do to improve your health and well being. It was the only video that I could find on the subject so I bought it. I tried a few of the exercises, and you can feel your chi flowing because of them, otherwise my video sits and gathers dust until I get more time to practice what's on it."
5,Brahms At Its Best,"First off, despite previous reviews, the sound of this recording is excellent. The piano has a rich, sumptuous sound, so perfect for Brahms. Mr. Lupu plays the Brahms with both passion and an exquisite touch. Comparing this recording to those of Van Cliburn and Artur Rubinstein, incredibly, Radu Lupu's is extravagantly superior in both interpretation and the sound of the piano. Lupu plays the inner voices in these pieces with such finesse, reminiscent of Horowitz. This is one great Brahms CD!"
4,Drive-ins and Carhops,"This is a novel based loosely on the author's experiences growing up in the 1950's and 1960's in Dallas. The story revolves around Macy, a teenage girl who is struggling to help support her impoverished family. She meets an 18 year old boy named James who becomes her first love. When Macy's family suddenly moves away, she loses contact with James. They never have a chance to say goodbye.What if, 30 years later, these two found each other again? Would lightening strike twice? Would he forgive her for running off without a word?I liked this book. It is a touching, bitter-sweet love story - one that will especially appeal to Christian readers. I'm looking forward to the author's next book."
3,Major printing errors,"Be aware. The current printing of this book has some serious typesetting problems. Nearly every page has ""garbled"" text where letters overlap. The publisher responded by stating: ""The book which you are referring is now temporary unavailable due to major printing errors."""
4,A damn good show!,"MATCH 1: INTERCONINENTAL TITLE: Carlito Vs Ric Flair - 6/10A decent opener, FLAIRly entertaining, with some hilarious skits with ric flair partying throughout the night.MATCH 2: Victoria and Torrie Wilson Vs Trish Stratus and Ashley - 5/10A good womans match, ashley takes a slight bump.MATCH 3: Big Show Vs Snitsky - 4/10Not a good match, at least they kept it short.MATCH 4: Kerwin White Vs Shelton Benjamin - 8/10A very fast paced match, should have been longer.MATCH 5: STEEL CAGE MATCH: Edge Vs Matt Hardy - 9/10Amazing. Match Of The Year Candidate.MATCH 6: WORLD TAG TEAM TITLES: The Superheroes Vs Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch - 7/10A pretty good match, hurricane takes a bump.MATCH 7: Chris Masters Vs Shawn Michaels - 8/10A great match, as we can also expect from Michaels.MATCH 8: WWE TITLE: John Cena Vs Kurt Angle - 8/10A great match with a really bad ending.Overall Event Rating: 7/10"
3,SHOULD BE OK,"Here are my predictions for the show!WWE Championship: John Cena v.s Kurt Angle- winner: Cena, but dont count Angle out just because Cenas set to defend over seas.Matt Hardy v.s Edge- 2 out of 3 falls:1st fall: Street Fight2nd fall: Cage match3rd fall: Ladder Matchwinner: Matt HardyChris Masters v.s HBK Shawn Michaels Winner: HBK with a ""great effort"" from Masters.Intercontinental Championship: Ric Flair v.s Carlito winner: Carlito will cheat to winBigshow v.s Gene Snitski: Winner Big ShowTag Team Championship: Tyson Tomco and Renee Dupree v.s Hurricane and Rosey winners: Tomco and Dupree because of Cade and murdoch.Divas 3 0n 2 match: Trish and Ashly v.s Torrie Candice and Victoria winners: Trish and Ashly.Its a shame but it looks like Shelton Benjamin could be left off the show!!! I would have liked to see him face Rob Conway! O well maybe he will!"
4,I think it is exactly what it states itself to be.,"I found the book to be an excellent source for the absolute beginner. It is not intended to make you an engineer but just open the door to a great program. I will be in search of a more indepth book,but without this one there would have been no need. Two thumbs up to Grabowski!!!"
4,Classic early 90's techno,"Classic early 90's techno.The songs still hold up, and some were unique for that music and genre. I loved it."
2,Poor Condition,"For some reason, a few pages of the book had been torn off when it came here (Page 32,56, and 78). I didn't realize that at first until I got to those pages. So annoying!!!!!"
4,the standard college text...,"This is the standard college text book for music theory specifically writing 4 part harmony. It has some basic music theory which applies to all types of music and goes into depth into a specific genre/period which is, as the title suggests, tonal harmony. I haven't finished reading yet but I noticed brief references to a few other forms of music in the back. I also learned in the first few pages why piano players who come from this school of thought have such a hard time charting modern music... most music majors have no choice and will be working through this book, just remember music theory is still being developed today so this 200 year old school of thought is not the last word, just a stepping stone."
3,return was not easy/ no info given online,"Box was nice, but small drawers fell out of casing when opened. (no kind of ""stops""). Vendor needs to list return info on amazon site, ratherthan having customer search around for email address and wait for vendors reply."
4,brief yet substantial overviews of subjects,"The author does a good job in presenting his views without being overtly offensive, although the matter-of-fact style may appear cold to someone with a differing perspective. I found the overviews brief yet satisfying for the fact that they contain a lot of useful, meaty information. One might expect a book whose purpose is to treat divisive issues to be written from more of a non-partisan stance, however that is not the case here. I did note however that the author has an eclectic educational background. From this I was persuaded that he is an open-minded individual who genuinely has a heart for the truth of the scriptures. Then again, if the book were written from a neutral point of view, you may never hear the true arguments pro or con for each position. After you read this book, you may wish to read a few more with different perspectives and compare them to see which seem to be more consistent with the scriptures."
4,love this case and all my daughters want it,I would have give it a 5 star if it wasn't so expensive. we had to apply for the amazon credit card in order to get a discount for a price I could live with.great quality and fits all my baremineral products and then some. the drawers pull out smoothly. I was surprised by the weight of this case very well put together. I also thought it would take up more countrer space but since it is taller than what thougt it's a great fit
5,This is just gorgeous on a vanity!,"I've been eyeing this for awhile, but was reluctant to order it because of the price. I finally caved -- and it is absolutely beautiful!As other reviewers have said, this is a very high quality product, so it looks very elegant sitting out in your bedroom or bathroom. The acrylic is very expensive-looking, and doesn't look cheap at all.I researched this before buying it, and I had read something on-line about how acrylic is more expensive than regular plastic, and I can see why. This has a nice sparkle to it.I bought it to hold my hair accessories and some makeup, and it looks lovely! It's a definite splurge, but it holds a lot and looks lovely doing so!"
5,Amazing,"Perfect for holding earrings. Sturdy and beautiful. This is a great solution to someone who has lots of jewlery and needs a place just for earrings. The drawers are not very tall, so other larger pieces would not work as well."
5,Fantastic!,"I had read the reviews and decided to go for it, I was wondering if buying a ""jewelry"" case was the way to go, I couldn't be more pleased. Not only did all my cosmetics fit ( some need to be placed on their side) it's great to be able to see what you need at a glance. The clear drawers are so functional and very easy to clean, the only thing that would make this better would be if the drawers had stoppers, because I have mine on the floor I have to make sure I tilt it back as I lift it to the counter, really no big problem, other than that I would say to you go ahead and purchase it, you will be pleased........"
2,"""Muzak"" like.","The reviews on this CD so far have been excellent: five stars (from both US & UK sites). Technically, the Caravelles sung very well: clear diction, in pitch, good ensemble, voices harmonized with each other, and with decent arrangements/accompaniments. But why does it only received two stars from me?The answer is rather simple: you get tired of the lack of inflection in the Caravelles' raspy-voices, as well as the same-tempo-in-every-song, very very fast. Some people might treasure the nostalgic value of this group, I found it rather excruciating listening to the CD from beginning to the end. I do like Easy-Listening music (Nelson Riddle, Mantovani, Peter Nero, Rogers Williams...), but not the kind that sounds so plain and resembles ""Muzak""."
5,Absolutely Beautiful Music,"I first heard of Scarlet through her workings with Bob Dylan, on the Desire album.She also played with Tracy Chapman, so I thought I'd give a listen to her colaboration with Tommy Eyre (the pianist who jammed with George Harrison and Joe Cocker).The album is great, the music is pretty soothing, to say the least.I'm already saving my Sheckels to buy another one of her albums for myself for Christmas.BUY the album, ya won't be sorry."
3,"DAMAGED BOX, BUT GAME IS GREAT!!!","THE BOX TO THE GAME CAME WITH ONE OF THE CORNERS BROKEN, BUT IT IS STIL USEABLE. THE GAME ON THE OTHER HAND IS IN PRISTINE CONDITION AS WAS THE BOOK. THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY IS EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE. IN ALL I WOULD SAY THAT I WAS LEFT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BY THE SELLER BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE BOX SHOULD AND WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INTACT. MAYBE I AM JUST TOO PARTICULAR, WHO KNOWS? EITHER WAY I AM NERVOUS ABOUT DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS BUYER AGAIN. B-"
5,Awesome Game! Comparable to Zelda!,"This game is the Zelda of the PS2. I bought this thinking it was a flop, the company went out of business but little did I know, this is one of the best adventure game I've played on the PS2. The painbrush control is the coolest thing about this game. It was too new for its time. I really enjoyed this game because of the story and the gameplay mechanics. It is very addictive and it keeps you playing for hours just fighting creatures and saving the village. I still haven't beaten this game but have played over 30 hrs so far and I have to say, It can beat Zelda any day, especially since it's on the wii now."
4,okami the next type of game,Okami is an exellent game to say the least. The unique brush stroke system works great with the rest of the game. The story is very interesting with a ton of unforgetable characters. Wonderful art and character designs.
4,Okami,My daughters had finish this game before I even bought it through renting itbut they still wanted the game and are still playing it.
2,Meh...,"I know people rant and rave about this game like it's the best thing since sliced bread. I just could not get into it. The concept sounded cool and the visuals are cool, but the fact that the dialogue is in some made up mumble is annoying. That fact alone is what made me stop playing."
5,Who knew it could be done?,"I read this in two sittings and couldn't wait to get back to it whenever I had to deal with something tearing me away (like eating). Somehow Ruvinsky has managed to weave together a mythological parable with a contemporary story of love and suspense. It's so hard to recommend books to friends, given everyone's idiosyncrasies, but I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't like this."
2,Thomas Brothers it Isn't,"I didn't realize that this is a map of only the major streets and attractions in Phoenix. It's just kind of a laminated version of a AAA map for Arizona for the Pheonix area (although AAA also has city maps that would provide all the streets in the city). I guess it's good if you're just going there to play tourist for a while, but for anything else, it's not useful."
5,very helpful,This map is essential if you don't have a GPS in the rental car or don't own one. We visit Phoenix for the first time and it definitely helped us out.
2,streetwise Phoenix map,this map was not for me. I didn't like the way how half the city is on one side and the other half is on the other. It really is confusing. You could probably get a better map by printing one out online for free.
4,Fascinating But Sometimes Difficult,"I read this book after reading Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle which I highly enjoyed. Psychology and the Occult is along the same lines as Synchronicity - it is the rare exploration of supernatural phenomenon by a professional psychiatrist. I found this book to be really intriguing - although be warned - it is a bit difficult and may take some time to get through, even though it is a relatively short book at under 160 pages of content. The author's professional discipline when approaching the subject, and open-mindedness is interesting. His assessment of events seems fair and he really delves into some strange occurrences. I would have given this book a perfect score if it was presented in a more approachable manner - although it is still very much worth reading."
4,GREAT!,"If you like Ricky Skaggs and Kentucky Thunder you will love this CD! One of my favorite tunes on this CD is 'Road to Spencer', great instrumental with Celtic overtones."
5,A must for a Young Music Enthusiast,"I bought this because I want my 9 year old niece to listen to it as well. When I saw the recent movie ___ in which the Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra is prominently featured, I thought it was time to buy the recording and listen to the whole piece. Britten and the London Philharmonic are a good combination."
2,kcr,"I found this book to be poorly reasoned. While the author claims to have well supported conlcusions, the vast majority of her conclusions do NOT follow from the research she cites.In light of the events at VA Tech in the last week, I would note that there was one individual who fit the profile of her book, but the reaction of the vast majority of students, both at VA Tech, and around the world, indicated what a wonderful generation of thoughtful young people are coming into their place in the world."
2,Generation self-centered and unstructured,"Initially I was excited by this book. As an anthropologist, the many differences between generations are a subject that never fails to fascinate. Unfortunately, while the author tosses out great statistics indicating fair research, she couches it all in an `I, me, my, mine' framework. This focuses the book not so much on a generation that may differ from those who came before but on the author herself, her education, her college years, and her friends. The overall impression is an unstructured book justifying why they themselves are having trouble with the joys and trials of living life.If the reader is looking for another whining confused confessional please continue. If you are looking for a book that may lend insight in to why the under 30 crowd do what they do then I would recommend that you read elsewhere."
3,12mm Timex watch band,The band was very nice. It was attractive and stylish. I recieved it in a timely manner even though it did not qualify for prime. It has already torn where it fastens to watch. zi may have ordered the wrong size.
5,Cute little sewing kit.,"I bought this tackle box to use as a box that holds all of my sewing stuff. It's perfect! I use the bottom area to store patches and extra cloth, while putting my needles/pins/thread in the top two levels. The only small problem is that there's no perfect place to put big scissors. I just put them in the bottom anyway though. It's not the most sturdy construction, but I have had no problems with it at all!"
3,A bit flimsy,"For the price, it's okay. Construction seems a bit questionable and I'm guessing it may not be waterproof because it does not appear to ""seal"". All in all though, this is an alright buy."
4,Good size and lightweight,"Nice little tackle box for heading out to the lake. The size works great for me and allows for enough storage for extras. However, I saw the 3-tray box on sale for $10.97 at Bass Pro today...just a thought if you want something a little bigger."
4,"it is elementary, oh yeah babe","I don't know what else can be said about this wonderful DVD. Everything you've ever loved about life can be found in Sour Grapes. Life has many wonderful surprises at each and every turn. If you are a fan of the kind of life I'm describing right now, then you are really in luck, because sometimes I don't even know how old I am. You love people who don't understand life, and Sour Grapes is a classic."
3,First time lisner,"This is my first taste of Tristania. at first i did not think I liked it much but it grows on you (much like Nightwish). it has death Growls of which i am not much of a fan but i have to say it works here better than it did in Within Temptation's album 'Enter' and the clean male vocals are wonderful (too bad there is not much of then. i'd like to here more songs with just him) the female vocals are nothing to rave about but are clean and good. my two favorite songs from the album are 'Wormwood' and 'Tender Trip on Earth' espeicaly the former. Wow. all in all i would recomend it to anyone who likes Nightwhish, Within Temptation or any like groups. just give it a chance. also if you would like to hear any full length songs before you buy the album go to [...] and put in the groups name and they will have a few full length songs you can listen to"
3,"OK, But...","A glowing, praise-filled biography of someone everybody seems to have loved, probably with good cause. If you were looking for details about Johnson's stellar climbing career, however, you will be disappointed: the author is clearly not a climber and seems to have little interest in that aspect of her subject's life. Also, the editing job on this book is terrible; it's full of misspellings and grammatical errors. I'd get it from the library."
5,"This is a great cd, the seller has quality items.",I purchased one of these and liked it so much I found someone else who was selling one so I purchased it for my niece.
5,Entertaining & Enjoyable!,"If you're into 50's & 60's music, this is the most entertaing & enjoyable books you will ever read. My only complaint is that it's so good, I can't put it down.Unfortunately, it's out of print, but it's still available from used book sellers.I would love to see a volume 2.The most amazing thing is that you see Divine Providence & the Creator's hand involved time after time in the way these songs became hits. Incredible!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I thought I would really enjoy this book as I enjoyed another one in the series but it was pretty lame at parts. The sisters are too watered down. They don't have their spunk or passion. They seem to nice and agreeable. Where is their spunk?The main problem I had with the book was the story itself. It was so ridiculous. I have watched other witch shows and read other witch books and this one is just too hard to swallow. The actual writing was poor. A high schooler could have written it. If you don't follow the show (I don't anymore) then you may find some of the details and terminology hard to understand. What exactly does ""orbed out"" mean?I am glad I got this from the library and didn't waste the money. I am not giving up the series however because I'm sure some of the other books are good."
1,Just an other biker flick,The dvd does not actually compare to anything. If you liked biker build off then this is the opposite of it
4,WHO SINGS THOSE SONGS??,"I LOVE THAT THIS CD HAS ALOT OF THE OLDIES... BUT!!! IT DOESNT HAVE ALOT OF THE ARTISTS NAMES AND THAT REALLY KILLS THE WHOLE VIBE OF THE CD,WHEN WE BUY THEM WE EXPECT TO SEE THE NAME OF THE ARTIST WHO SINGS IT; FOR EXAMPLE: ""DIAMOND IN THE BACK"" I LOVE THIS SONG; BUT I DONT KNOW WHO SINGS IT AND THATS A REAL KILLER"
3,Classic Go-Go,This is a collection of Classic Go-Go. There are only a few resent tracks in this collection. DC's best bands are featured. Old Schoolers will remember some of these tracks. If you never heard of or listened to Go-Go I would not purchase this CD but buy a Chuck Brown live CD first.
1,What about the issues of boys AND girls!?,"While I applaud all attempts to provide supportive advice to our young people as they navigate the path of adolesence, I have a hard time supporting authors who copy the writings and titles of a fantastic book TSM that came out on this subject in the late seventies. Get your own material!"
2,lenovo are a bunch of THIEVES,product broke within 3 weeks of buying... man on phonr said send it back cuz it was covered by warranty. i recieved no resonse for weeks. finally i called and they said it wasnt covered.... that it was due to negligence.... when it def was not. then they offered to fix it for $750. lol lol i brought it to an independent guy who fixed it for 200.TALK ABOUT A BUNCH OF THIEVES STAY AWAY
3,Mediocre...,"82 minutes only, not 178 as advertised.The music clips are interupted constantly.Not what I expected, For fans only,"
3,Description,"She'd helped to convict him -- but was he innocent?Andrea Meyers was on the jury that convicted prominent New Mexico stockbroker Lucas Hastings of defrauding his clients. She was never comfortable with the verdict, though; the case against him was just too perfect. And as an ordained minister, Andrea tended to believe the best of people not the worst.When Luke was released from prison, he came straight to Andrea's church. He came because there was an attraction between them that sizzled and crackled and drew them together. A dangerous passion that held no future. After all, what did a minister whose parish was her family, a woman who'd survived a difficult and deprived existence, have in common with a man like Lucas Hastings? A man who'd been born to wealth and privilege. A man she'd helped put in jail."
3,A mordern Goldfrapp,"This cd contains 12 pieces of music that have been remixed : 11 from the cd Supernature and one from Black Cherry. If you like Supernature, you may like this one more, or like it less than the original, but for shure this is not the kind of music Goldfrapp issued in the previous cds -A lot more electronic and dance music. Personnaly, I prefer the first album (Felt Mountain) and the last one (2008 : 7th tree) which contain beautifull and profoundly original compositions, including relaxing ones."

4,Like any old movie.,"Like any old movie, it's always better when you were a kid and watched it. Although it's not that bad, I remember it being cooler as a kid."
5,the Pistol,This is an excellent movie about the drive it takes to be successful. Pistol Pete was the greatest basketball player of his era and this movie details his drive for success.
5,"Haunting, but not intentionally","Although, at first sight, her work does not seem to be appealing, it immediately led me to read through these rather haunting stories. Her writing style is quite eloquent and inspiring. Different from other rather self-centered novelists (e.g., Dazai, Mishima, Natsume, etc.), she stays as a objective narrator in her work, and her structiring ability of plot is almost astonishing. Probably she is a natally most talented writer in modern Japan."
5,This book reveals much more than what you learn in College,I disagree with one of the reviewers of this book. The Everything New Teacher Book tells much more about 'the way it is'. It gives insight into what a new teacher will have to deal with politically and otherwise. It gives a view of education that doesn't always subscribe to what college of education professors think is true. I believe that it gives a much more realistic and even view of what teaching is all about.
1,"Its the going, not the getting there that's good!","Based on my ecstatic love of Abby Newton's ""Crossing to Scotland"", I was anticipating to be bowled over again by music recorded on location at what must have been some stunning acoustic sets. Underwhelmed at first, I have given the CD time and several plays... Still, it compares unfavorably to her prior CD. She's great anyway, but if you're choosing between two CDs, this is not the better one."
4,Another fine selection from the grill of Kermit & the gang,"Kermit serves up another fine selection of New Orleans-style funk-based swing. If you liked ""Live"" then this is a must have! Logan will love this one..."
1,Negative Review,"Very hard to put together. My child was 6 mos. when he started to use it and within a few days he had bounced himself right onto the floor! The ""knots"" used to secure the pouch to the jumper gave out. I am returning the product. I am unhappy with it. I have all Graco products and love them."
1,beware,i put my son in he fell right through! i thought i put it together wrong my husband came home from work ckecked it out he pur him back and boom hit the floor again. it is dangerous be weary!!!!!
5,We love it,"All my kids have had these things. They just love them! They bouncy and get their excersize and aren't fussy at all when they're in them.The only draw back is you have to have the right kind of doorway, and it makes your baby do the ""jelly legs"" thing when you try to hold them standing up."
5,One of the best things we bought!,"Despite the recommended age of five months, we put our baby in for the first time at just over two and a half months old (with a towel wrapped around him for support, the seat is pretty wide). He had been standing on our laps with support for several minutes at a time, and we thought he'd enjoy it. The first time we put him in he just sort of dangled there, the next day he moved his feet a bit, and by the end of the week he was jumping away! It became one of his favorite pasttimes.Because of the seat size and adjustable height, we were able to use this for months. You do have to have a doorway with molding on it to hang it from - we had to put ours in the bathroom doorway, but it was worth the hassle. It's very easy to put up and take down. You can hang toys from rings on either side, and there's a nice tray in front, too (not that you'd want to put snacks on while they're jumping!). This is a great product and I'm looking forward to using it with our new baby."
1,HAZARD FOR BABY,"I thought that this jumper would be safe, but it is not. I work at a daycare center where it is used almost everyday, until today when it broke with a child in it. One minute he was jumping, the next screaming because he had fallen to the floor. It seems that the straps attached to the 3 plastic clamps on the top broke off. Luckily he was OK, just a little scared. We called GRACO and they were surprised that it broke. I would suggest looking at other models if you are looking to purchase this one."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL PARENTS,This is the greatest item for our high-energy son. We have a very large doorway between the dining room and living room and it is perfect for him to go wild. I wouldn't recommend the jumper if you don't have a large doorway.
2,Only if you must put your baby down.,"I own this item, but never used it, as I am not a fan of toys that are used in place of human interaction or used to ""accelerate"" a baby's motor skills. All healthy children learn to walk, jump, and play without the aid of these toys."
2,ok,"I wasnt as impressed by this book i thought it would have more techical information, its sort of wishy washy, or more fluff"
5,Grandloving: Making Memories with Your Grandchildren,A complete guidebook to keep near at hand from the time your grandchild is born until he or she become a teen and even beyond. Practical suggestions for interacting with grandchildren who visit often as well as grandchildren who live far away. Chock full of fun activities. You'll get new ideas on how to communicate with grandchildren of all ages to create relationships that will last a lifetime.
5,In-depth look at NTFS,"This book covers NTFS at the byte level. It has tables and explanations that extremely useful for a course I was taking. I purchased most of the computer forensic books available but all the other books contained mere summaries of NTFS. This volume covers the nuts and bolts. Excellent book, need more like this."
2,Bearstone is BORING!,"I had to read this book for school and it was really boring! I mean, who cares about him climbing mountains? I reccomend this book for boys and not girls. It's a confusing book also. Where are his friends? Blueboy can't talk! Alright, it was OK."
1,stupid book,"this was a stupid book hence the name stupid book a boy named cloyd is staying with walter and a new friendship formed it was dumb if you have to do a report that is due in 3 days and you have to choose between a 7,998,654,123 page book on taxes and the 90 page book called bearstone for goodness sake choose the tax book. All the book talks about is an indian sitting there on his butt making kissing faces."
4,The Power Of The Bearstone,"This book really put the fact that being alone is not a good idea into perspective. The book did have somewhat of a dramatic plot. It was like a heartrate line, the suspense came and went throughout the book. The characters were beyond realistic. Cloyd had a problem with the red-haired man, just like people have problems with other people in the world. This book also had a real place as the setting which was very neat! The book showed that ""If you put your mind to it, you can do anything"". This statement is true because Cloyd wanted so badly to climb the Rio Grande and he ..............................WAIT why would I tell you?You'll just have to read it to find out!"
1,Game Freezes!!!!,"Do not buy, listen to everybody when they say the game freezes!!! It always does. Dont waist your time, and especially your money!"
2,Feeze King,"Despite all its fabulous features and graphics, the game freezes constantly! Don't waste your money."
4,Dog Pack,"Fits my 70 pound-ish lab well. She wears it on every walk and seems comfortable in it. I wish there were smaller pockets in the large pouches to carry small items like my keys. I put bags for cleaning up her ""messes"" in one side and she carrys the ""mess"" on the other side. I like not having to carry it with me!Seems durable. Arrived in a timely manner. Would prefer cloth like canvas instead of this material but this material probably will make it last longer. Overall, it was what I'd expected and it works well. I'm happy with it."
4,Pretty big for a small!,"Took it for our first hike it and it survived 4 hours through shrub and lots of mud! Started to shift as we drank the water and left it unbalanced. Did not seem to phase my dog at all. Idea was to tire her out, but I was the exhausted one at the end. She could have kept going! Glad I bought the small for my 40lb border collie mix, reviews were right about it running big. The small is pretty big. Can hold four .5L bottles of water in each side!! That's 4L of water! Can't wait to go back coutry hiking and know she can carry her water, food and bowl!"
4,Had this one for awhile,"I had this one for awhile and then over the weekend it broke. I'm not really sure what happened but I took a long 7 hour trip and on the way home I plugged it into the lighter slot in the car and... nothing. I was sad, because I really liked this fm transmitter. I had it for a really long time. The only thing that I found annoying was that if it didn't hear sound and I listened to quieter songs from soundtracks it would occasionally not pick up the sound and shut off. But that was only every once in awhile and most of the time it worked.I loved how it was easy to use and the sound quality was always pretty decent. Depending on where I was, I'd hear some static in the background, but not enough for me to degrade the review. I really liked this product, but I decided to go with the Aerielle i2i FM Transmitter this time.If that doesn't work out, I will definitely revert back to the iRiver transmitter."
2,Overactive power saving,"Takes a bit too long to power on when you start your car, and is much too quick to power off in the absence of a strong signal. Makes an awful racket when it's powering off. Not recommended."
1,Broken after 3 weeks of use,"U enjoyed this FM transmitter for almost three weeks, it stopped transmitting a signal one day."
5,HOW TO DISABLE THE AUTO-OFF FEATURE ON IRIVER AFT-100!!,"The iRiver AFT-100 is by far the BEST FM TRANSMITTER in the marketplace, with one exception....the AUTO-OFF FEATURE. There are over 700 reviews on this product at Amazon, and people rave that it is the strongest transmitter out there, and I agree, having tried many brands from Monster, Griffin, Belkin, etc.The only problem is the Auto-Off feature was driving me crazy as it would turn off in about 30 seconds with any kind of silence, low level in the music, or when I made a phone call, and then blaring static shot through my speakers. I was ready to move onto another solution when I found Greg Erker.The plans to do the modification are on his website, or you can contact him if you don't want to modify it yourself. He modified mine, and DISABLED THIS FEATURE and I'm thrilled as it never cuts out anymore! [...]"
1,Really annoying due to a fatal flaw!,"Although this device gets fairly good reception with a minimum of static, it comes with a poorly designed ""auto shut-off"" feature that causes it to shut itself off if it detects no sound for 30 seconds. Problem is, its idea of ""no sound"" and yours are likely to be quite different: if you're listening to something that's merely soft, or you have the volume turned down low, it interprets this as no sound, and shuts off with an extremely annoying, ear-splitting whine of interference. This happened to me over and over again, every 30 seconds, until I figured out what was causing it to shut off. On an iPod, the only way to avoid this is to make sure the volume on the iPod (not your car radio) is always at least 75% of the maximum, which can be difficult to maintain. Be warned: this is an extremely annoying flaw, and it indicates that the makers/designers didn't test the product well at all."
1,Does not work,I was replacing a irock FM transmitter and figured I would upgrade to this one. This did not even come close to the sound quality of my prior unit. I returned this and bought the irock again.
2,its OK..but shorted out on me!,"I am in Tampa, FL. I had this one for close to a year & worked out well...The best frequencies would be between 90.1 & 90.3 fm, but still got light static on these stations...particularly notable when listening to soft/quieter music. This also worked well with a portable DVD player I use for the kids to hear the movie through the car speakers...until my daughter accidentally kicked the power cord to the DVD player (for the record, she didn't touch the transmitter)...I heard a loud ""pop"" & all went off, but guess what?...instead of my DVD player shorting out (which was fine), the transmitter no longer works. The display won't light up any longer and it won't give out a signal.Word of caution, be very careful with it, its SUPER sensitive...whatever you do, do not unplug while its doing its job cause I guess you might end up with a very light paperweight."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","I've had this product for about a month now. I can't say it's as fantastic as many other reviewers seem to think it is. However, it does the job. So far it works consistently like it's supposed to, but the sound quality leaves something to be desired. I am plagued with frequent occurrences of static/distortion. While this doesn't by any means render my music unlistenable, it does get annoying. Also, it doesn't quite fit into my lighter far enough so it will occasionally lose power after being jostled. That being said, I guess it will have to do. However, in the future I don't think I'll bother with transmitters anymore. In retrospect, I wish I had had a modulator installed instead."
4,FM transmitter works well,"Bought the transmitter for my daughter to use in her car. She has used it alot and is quite happy with it. It has a good sound quality, picks up MP3 player signal well, no problems finding blank stations. Auto-off function was a bother so I used the website instructions to bypass the function."
4,Works just like it says (mostly),Pros: Full range of stations to pick fromWorks well most of the timeCons: Every now and then it goes wonky. Don't know if its because of my mp3 player or maybe that if it dosent transmit anything for a while it autoshuts off (or something like that). Easy remedy: re-plug it
1,Reliability is TERRIBLE,"The product failed three times in one year. First, a fuse failed. iRiver replaced the fuse, but I had to pay shipping. Then the unit developed static so badly that it was totally unusable. iRiver replaced the unit with another unit. The new unit also developed static within the first four weeks. Don't buy this model. It's a piece of junk. Get something else that works."
2,Quality issues,Worked great for the first months but then it start producing crackling sound. I can hardly hear the transmission now. Online support is non responsive.
2,Awful and most unreliable,Spent 69$ and could not use it for my Honda civic 2002 but did work in my new vehicle.Spent more then 20 hours just trying to make it work.
1,Find something else...,"I used this once, and it worked for about 15 minutes. I was making my way out of the Twin Cities area (about 15-20 minutes out), and it didn't work for me at all. I tried to tune it multiple times, but nothing came through. As I came back through that same area where it did work for a short period of time, and used the same channel, it STILL DIDN'T WORK! I'm going to return it and find something better. I wasn't satisified with this product."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes when I purchased this product. But the sound output it gives out to my car's FM is ""MONO"" and not stereo. I have tried changing the channel to several different ones that have no other station on them but still get the same results. I would not recommend this to anyone who cares about audio quality. I was not expecting CD quality from this but at least I was expecting stereo FM quality. This thing produces more like an AM radio signal that is mono.The only thing good about it is that it has compact design."
1,Poor Warranty,"Be careful when ordering this! The one that I bought from Amazon worked fine for a few months and then the wiring must have developed a short in it because as I move the wire around, the audio goes to different speakers. It's gotten pretty annoying and I've replaced this with another device from a different company. A removable audio cable could have easily avoided this problem.The warranty period is only for 90 days which seems absurd to me -- so be careful."
1,No support,"I bought the iRiver because of the great reviews it received. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same experience. Mine stopped working after about three hours of use. I understand that maybe I just got one that was defective or there may have been some simple fix that needed to be done, but I'll never know. I tried getting support from iRiver, but that didn't happen. I sent an e-mail and received no response. I tried calling their support line, found out they no longer have an 800 number, then spent 7 minutes on hold - long distance of course. It was just a bad experience all around!"
1,W.....T.....F...?????,"Alright, I got this and it was on time... actually early. I was really excited and the next day I was going out to get something so I decided to try it out. I plug it in the cigarette lighter plug and hook up my new ipod. I turn it on because I heard you need to have the ipod running for it to work. When I push play, nothing. Nothing. I try the buttons on it. Nothing. It does not turn on. It did not even work. I am extremely disappointed with how cheaply this was made. It feels like there is only the plastic casing there and it is hollow. Piece of crud, this thing is."
4,"Great, not perfect.","I am very happy so far with this FM transmitter. Biggest problem is the auto shut off of 30 seconds, it could be longer. One minute would have been much better, but you get used to it. I have found that putting my mp3 player under my sun visor allows the wire running to the FM transmitter to be raised up allowing better quality and drops to no static. Signal seems to be strong enough to overpower weak broadcasts, locally in the St. Louis area I've been using 92.9 with great results so far."
4,Very nice,I got this for my daughter for X-mas and she loves it. It does have static at times but overall worth buying.
2,it does the job,"This is a neat little device but has some quirks. I thought it was unique to mine but after reading some other reviews found it is not mine or me. To use it after the first time you must go through a song and dance to get it to work. When I first turn it on I hear nothing. I unplug the reciever and plug it back in, now I hear everyother syllable. I then shut down the entire system and turn it on again then it works delightfully. No matter what I do this is how I have to do it each and every time to get it to work. There is no known upgrade for this issue yet. Other than that I love the fact that I can drive and listen to my audio books."
2,Expected better,"Sure, this is easy to use but after a few days it has started turning itself off and frequently gets interference from the radio. It would also be nice if this weren't for car use only."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst piece of electronics I have ever purchased. It shut down after about one minute of use and didn't send a signal to the radio anymore. I had to replug it in again for it to turn back on, only to have it turn off in about a minute again. Not only did it do this but it also had a very weak signal. I had it on FM and tried every blank(static) station I could find they all sounded the same. They sounded like a weak AM station and I had to turn the volume up almost to full in order to hear it. I know there are quite a few good reviews out there for this item, don't listen it's a trap. You are much better off sticking with CD's. Luckily Amazon has a good return policy and that's what I'm doing right after I write this...Returning a truly pathetic attempt at technology."
1,It does work but.......,It works but it sounds like a distant radio station. It cuts out and just isn't worth the money. For the same price you could buy a cassette deck and adapter and get far superior sound.
3,"It works, could work better though.","I bought this device for my ipod based on reviews I read on CNET that said it was the best in its class. As far as being able to plug it in, set the frequency and get it to work, it works fine. The sound quality is a bit muffled though, too much bass and not enough treble. It would be nice if there was an ipod specific model that incorporated an ipod car charger."
1,Junk! Not worth a penny!,"This product would seem to operate extremely poorly for less than 3 seconds and then would stop working. I would advise anybody to look for a different transmitter since this AFT 100 is a hunk of junk! In reality it should get NO stars, but this program does not allow for that!!"
5,Best I've tried,"I've owned atleast 4 different brand FM Transmitters. This is by far the best sounding, easiest to use, & best looking. All the other brands were either rotary adjustment or fixed presets. I am in the Seattle area & there aren't alot of unused frequencies. My last unit had 5 presets of which only one was not in use by local radio. I've used both the AFT 100 FM Transmitter & an cassette adapter. I can't tell any differace in sound between the two. Thanks for listening"
1,Worked for 5 minutes,It worked for 5 minutes. Then it died. I've tried all frequencies but get nothing but static. It appears to be cheaply made. I can recommend the Griffen Roadtrip.
4,iRiver AFT 100 works as well as can be expected,"This product works great! I have yet to use it in a city, but in the suburbs it works fine.The packaging and literature were a little cheesy, a plain white box obviously not intended for this product and photocopies of the instructions, which were perhaps not entirely complete.Those of you who experience distortion: TURN DOWN THE VOLUME ON YOUR MP3 PLAYER!!! The distortion may not be from radio reception, but too much output from your MP3 headphone jack. When I first got the iRiver, it distorted and I was initially disappointed, but when I turned the volume down on my ZEN Vision, it worked perfectly. There was nothing about this in the instructions.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
4,iRiver FM transmitter,"I've had no problems with interferance with this unit which is the common problem with transmitters.With 3 presets it's very easy to switch frequencies.The bad part is that it's hard to view the LCD display from sitting in the drivers seat, you have to face the display directly in front not at a angle."
5,Excellent sound quality,"Everything I hoped for.Easy to use, full frequency range & a great match to any quality MP3 player."
1,Don't Bother,"If you're looking for a product you have to replace after eight months, then this is the item for you. It does basically what it says it does in terms of broadcasting. The fading out when it doesn't detect a signal is more of a problem than I thought it would be (I had read previous reviews); soft songs or live music really cut out. The biggest issue for me was the quality. The wire for one channel eventually failed to deliver a signal after eight months, which meant that the device thought there was no signal at all, and so stopped transmitting. This is too expensive a product to be disposable on a yearly basis. I did contact iRiver about the issue, but they don't back their product after 90 days."
2,Cheap worthless [...],"Works great for me with my iRiver H320. Had it for 3 months and had no problems with it. UPDATE: After 3 months and a day, it died for no reason. Warranty expired, no way to fix it, my money gone."
3,OK in the country.,Product works OK for audio books and that is when you are able to find an FM site to use. Many urban areas don't have an empty FM spot to use.
4,Satisfied,"For the price this is an excellent item. The sound quality is excellent most of the time, with only minor hiccups from time to time. Overall I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product."
4,Nice product,"I previously purchased another FM transmitter that I had to return. I switched to the iRiver and I like this one much better! It has decent sound, and this device manages to power over most of the static you get on unused radio stations so it's not much of a problem when you're traveling unless you come within the vacinity of a strong station. It has a full scale of stations that can be used. The sound isn't going to be as good as it would be if you tied your device directly into the stereo with a cable, but it's still pretty good. I would guess that it rivals most any other FM transmitter that I've heard and is as good if not better. I also like the compace size. I have a Creative Zen Vision M that I love, but my car stereo doesn't have the connections necessary to support hooking any MP3 player in with a cable, so the iRiver satisfied my needs just fine. I've been using it 3 weeks now and am going to hang on to it."
5,Just what I needed,"The iRiver FM transmitter works just as advertised. I just finished a cross country car trip with my 2 kids and we were able to listen to music and audiobooks from my daughters iPod. The signal is good and I like the fact that it will work with any mp3 player, not just an iPod. I highly recommend this product."
3,A nice ending,"This book followed in the format that young adult literature should obtain. It was interesting and would be helpful to many young adults. It is geared more towards the male gender, but even as a female, I found it interesting. It was taken form the perspective of a more popular kid who picks on the underdog, but has a change of heart. It has a nice ending without being too sappy."
5,"A calm but craving book to read, great entertainment.","A boy who everyone calls Crash finds that one day a boy named Penn Webb moves in down the street. Crash decides to ""pick on or torture"" him because Penn is everything that a normal kid isn't. But when Crash's grandfather is put into the hospital because of a stroke and Webb sends a note to him, Crash reads it and starts to feel guilty about how he tortured Webb for entertainment and pleasure. Through guilt, Crash discovers what Webb is truly about. Crash soon realizes Webb is as normal and even more giving than anyone he has ever known."
5,My Favorite Book,"A boy they call Crash was six and he thought his new neighbor, Penn, was weird because he only had one toy, lived in a house that was once a garage, always wore dorky buttons that said ""Flickertale"" or ""Peace"" on them, and was a Quaker and vegetarian. When a new neighbor shows up in the summer of sixth grade named Mike, he immediately becomes Crash's best friend. In school they play jokes on Penn and tease him. Crash falls in love with a girl named Jane. She doesn't like him because he's so mean to Penn, who was on her CHEERLEADING team! A sad thing happened to his grandfather. You should read it to find out the ending. This is my favorite book. It is very funny and it took me only three days to read it, I never wanted to put it down!"
5,The Junior of Praise & Worship,"Byron Cage Is Prince of Prince and Worship, I call Micah the Junior of Praise and WorshipMicah' has that voice, and his style of Praise & is Worship is Electrifing, excuse spelling, i've gone 2 another level of praise listening 2 this cd,My favorite Praise Song's are ""We Lift You Up"" & (""Holy Visitation"" sounds like a reminscent of ""War Cry"" but still is an awesome song)My favoirite worship song on here is ""Another Place"" all of the vocals are excellent, I mean this def have you in another place in the LordThis CD, is def a A Fresh Wind, A Fresh Sound, and A cd that will become a Praise & Worship Classic for years 2 comeGo out and by"
5,Sony quality in this product.,No frills quality charger. Long lasting batteries. Great combo. Recommend highly.
2,"Charger ok, but not the battery","I bought this pack from another online store. After using more than 1 year, the battery power seems to be not as good as before. Getting a chance to use Energixer, I can tell there is a big difference from the 1st day of using both. Engergixer can stay longer. After half year used, and no sign of any degrade in power capacity."
4,Power charger does not equal rapid charger,I just got this a few weeks ago to charge batteries for our digital camera. Haven't used it much yet but it looks like it works fine.My only issue is that it takes 6-7 hours to charge the batteries. This isn't really a big deal for my home use but it might be for others. There are rapid chargers out there that charge the batteries in an hour or two.Also this unit doesn't indicate if the battery is already charged. Its a pretty basic unit for a pretty basic price. Just fine for basic use!
1,Batteries Won't Charge,"I initially charged these batteries for a full 8 hours, one more than the instructions required. When I put them in my camera, my battery light started flashing immediately. I tried the other pair, and they were not charged enough for the camera to operate. Thinking I hadn't charged them enough, or properly, I plugged them in again, this time for 3 days. Same result upon inserting them into the camera. I didn't try to shoot with them; perhaps they would have worked. But even if they did, I wouldn't trust them, and so I am returning them to Amazon. Caveat emptor! There are many fine reviews, and lots of people have had great luck with these batteries and charger, however, I am not one of them."
4,good so far,The product was as described and is working perfectly. I haven't had any problems thus far.
4,Sensacional!!,Equipmaneto de primeira e muito bem desenhado. Recomendo por ser rápido na recarga e de confiana!
5,battery charger,"absolutely a fantastic price with the batteries included, charges fairly fast so ya always have charged batteries ready to go, prompt shipping"
2,There is no way these batteries are 2500 mAH,My two year old sanyo eneloop batteries hold a charge longer and don't self discharge nearly as fast as these batteries. I would recommend something else over these. I purchased the charger with a set and an additional set. In my opinion it was a waste of money. My Lenmar R2G batteries and Sanyo eneloop batteries hold up much better.
2,"Slow charge time, doesn't shut off after batteries charge, batteries died in less than 2 years","Takes several hours to charge. It doesn't shut off after batteries charge, so they get very hot. There's no indicator to tell if the batteries are charged or dead. Batteries died in less than 2 years and I only recharged them maybe once a month."
4,Charger works great / batteries dont last :(,"I tried the charger and the batteries and i am very satisfied with the charger. However, batteries that came with the charger didn't last so much. I wasn't able to use them for more than 30 minutes in my digital camera (Olympus F300).Anyway i didn't expect more from what I paid for."
2,"Batteries ok, charger device = crap!!",If you charge the batteries with other charger device than the included here they work nice. This Sony charger really sucks!Impressed that Sony made such a bad charger device :( Not recommended!!!
4,Great comic book fun...,"This book is one of the DC Hero ""Which Way"" books (similar to Choose Your Own Adventure) that was published in the 80's. You are given control of Supergirl, and your choices determine what happens in the story. The storylines vary greatly, traveling from Camalot to Wonderland to outer space. Superman and several villians, including Braniac, make appearences. This is a fun book for Supergirl fans, and I would recommend picking it up, if you can find it."
3,play at low volumes only...,"...what can you expect, at just 6 watts RMS on the satellites and a measly 17 watts for the sub?Fine for rudimentary gaming, computer sounds, and other undemanding content. But hey, you get what you pay for."
4,Simple & easy to install.,"I bought this at a friend's recommendation and it's been great. Used a sawzall to cut the hole and did a kind of a sloppy job, but the outer rim is wide enough to cover minor cutting errors.One note is the door has a sliding lock mechanism. Fine if you have the door leading outside your home and want to control when the cat can leave. If you install it inside only, as I did, I suggest popping the lock off as the lock can engage and trap the cat if the step directly on it before pushing the flap."
1,DRMP3P01 MP3 Player,This item does not contain the correct drivers for Windows XP. Tried to locate the drivers from the company but the website is not accessable. Tried digital research technologies home page - page not found. The company was bought out by IOM holdings of Nevada but that was not help either. You would think someone would check their product before sending it out to market.
5,Great stuff here,"Short and simple, Stan's ""The Big Heat"" is great music.""The Big Heat"" is a no brainer obvious reflection on those boring days in Mojave Desert's Barstow when Stan read crime novels. The haunting keyboards and background vocals of the title track are as much a stand out feature of this CD as is the whimsical and calypso-esk ""Rio Greyhound."" ""Camouflage"" has a distinct CW McCall ring to it. Dated to be sure, ""Camouflage"" is a bit out there even for this Vietnam Era troop but it's worth a spin. Listen to the bonus track, ""Foggy River,"" to see the effect listening to Johnny Cash had on Stan.A true piece of art, ""The Big Heat"" is a most worthy addition to your new wave era collection."
4,A real woman,"If you are looking for a book that tries to analyze Patsy Cline from a woman's perspective, read Margaret Jones' biography. If you want dirt and hack writing, read Ellis Nassour. But if you want to know Patsy Cline, read this book. Patsy wrote it herself with a guiding hand from Mike and Cindy. Patsy tells us in her own words what kind of a woman she is and she shares her dreams and disappointments in a way no other writer can touch.Mike and Cindy let Patsy tell the story, intruding long enough to clarify a point or identify an obscure reference."
5,Forget those negative comments....,"Those negative comments are pathetic, at best. This score is wonderfully tense, and NOT AT ALL like ""The Four Feathers"" (which really made no sense in terms of comparison). The cold, atmospheric nature of this music really draws you in, and is both unsettling and highly enjoyable."
2,Not recommended reading,"OK, I'll admit it. I picked this book up because it was written by Tabitha King, spouse of that ""other"" horror novelist King you've undoubtedly heard of. The premise here is a familiar one--a sex-crazed genius develops a shrinking machine. Hence the title.What a disappointment.It's not a bad book, I suppose, but it's not really all that good, either. I strongly suspect that without the connection to her more famous husband, Mrs. King would not have found such a wide audience for this particular piece of work. While that may sound harsh (and even somewhat trite, considering she has a significant fan base of her own), it's true. This book is a mess, and King's obsession with below-the-waist issues (do we really want to hear about our heroine's meunstral cycles?) are almost unbearable.Don't waste your time on this one."
5,This is an awesome CD!!,"Hey there I just wanted to add my review to this and thanks for reading it!Now lately I've been into harder stuff (Think Lamb of God, Avenged Sevenfold, Unearth, God Forbid.. that kind of heavy metal) but this CD has hit home with me! As a fellow guitarist, Mark Tremonti hit it on the head with this cd.. I love how he has hard, heavy riffs and especially the shredding!! And I'm so glad that Brian Marshall is back! I've missed his bass lines..This CD also has something for everyone.. Heavy songs, slow songs, in between songs.. It's perfect!"
4,I like this album,"I'm a fan of a lot of Creed's music, and when I heard about this album, I went and checked it out. While they are not Creed Redux (which is a good thing, they have their own sound), Alter Bridge does have a similar feeling to a lot of Creed's ballads. The vocalist here, Myles, is better musically than Scott Stapp, hands down. Scott's voice was good for Creed's lyrics, but this brother Myles can WAIL, man. I like the heavier guitar emphasis, and my fave tracks are ""Find the Real"" and ""Broken Wings"". I also like ""In Loving Memory"" and ""Watch Your Words."" There are no really weak tracks on the album IMO, and I'm willing to check out their later releases."
3,Not bad,"Alter bridge a replacement for creed!? I think not. While the music is on par with creed, the interpretation by the new singer is not. His vocals are not as strong as stapps and neither are his lyrics or melody. Leaves me wanting creed to reform. Please!Hopefully stapps new cd will quench my thirst."
3,Average,"Overall, the album lacks diversity both lyrically and musically. I was highly disappointed when I got this album and only one song stood out to me which was In Loving Memory. The overall mood is rather solemn, if a person likes listening to that sort of thing. I do love Tremonti's guitar use in songs like Metallingus, Broken Wings, Find the Real, and The End is Near. That part of the album is swell. Myles Kennedy can sing as well, especially in Burn it Down and One Day Remains, but in songs like Open Your Eyes, the ""ooohs"" are a bit overdone. Overall, the songs I can tolerate are Burn it Down, In Loving Memory, Down to My Last, Watch Your Words, and Shed My Skin."
4,Bridging the gap,"I am not a passonate music fan. I don't listen to just one thing. Somedays I will play Mozart in the car and other days I will rock out to Country. I was a very unlikely fan of Creed. I reluctantly went to a CREED show with some friends and was moved by the adoration of their fans. I then bought the CD and loved it. Then they broke up. Nothing since Creed gave me the chills until AlterBridge. At first I wasn't that crazy about the singer on the cd because I was expecting the low baratone sound of Creed, until I saw them live. WOW! I have a real appreciation for the band. I especially love the bass lines. The cd is great but a live show is AWESOME!"
3,Give them time.....,"No, it's not creed but it's not horrible. I would much rather have Scott Snapp but Kennedy actually does a pretty good job considering he's not the best singer out there. Creed has always been a great band to me so when Scott left I was shocked but Alter Bridge is a fresh, new ""take-off"" on creed. The album really isn't that great, only a few real stand-out tracks. The lyrics are probably the worst part about the album, no real meaning behind them at all. Mark sounds great on guitar and so does the rest of creed but in the back of our minds we all want Scott back. Since that probably won't happen I think we should just give Alter Bridge the time to mature, they'll come around after a few CD's. Until then enjoy this album for what it's worth, not what it could be."
5,Great Product!!!,"This is an Excellent shopping cart cover! After reading the reviews, I decided to try this out, and I love it! I can bring my son out shopping without worrying about the germs! :)"
2,The most anticipated ppv of the year?,"What was thought to be a great PPV was a bomb! This was one of the worst ppv's of the year by far. What was thought to have a huge impact on story lines and a new begining for the wwf was halted when the driver who ran over stone cold was still not resolved. The matches themselves were boring and pointless. The steel cage match was not up to edge, christians, and the hardys potential and I was real disappointed beacuse they did not show much of there skills. The main event was like an ordinary match on a smackdown episode. The outcome was also real disapointing. The only upside to this ppv was the return of stone cold steve austin after 10 months. Do not buy this ppv. Trust me!"
3,its nice i suppose,"if this card were to magically appear in my pocket i would be exstatic. provided of cours that i had a sony device. its small, it works, its durable, and there is a good amount of space on it.however, in the land of thing not magically appearing in my pocket, there are a lot of cons to this memory stick. for one, its exspencive. another reason is that its only good for sony products. yet another is that you have to use this little switch on the thing if you want to use it to maximum capacity. on the other hand this might... might, provide a usefull organizing tool for some.in any case, if your looking for a memory card for a sony product that you've already bought, then this is a good buy. but if your looking into buying a sony product let this card be a deterent (not a big one mind you, but if your down to two competing products, then i would say go with the other one)."
2,Boorum & Pease 66500J Record / Account Book.,"Boorum & Pease account and record books are excellent having an old-time cloth covering and tight (firm) binding. But their choice of paper is quite another matter. It is extremely thin and the ink from your pen bleeds through to the next page rendering it completely useless. This means that while one believes they have 500 pages at their disposal, they have in fact only 250 due to this problem of ink bleeding. Unfortunately, you do not know any of this until you actually attempt using a pen on the page's poor quality paper. But once the ink has bleed through to the next page, it's considered ""used merchandise"" and the vender isn't about to refund your money or allow you to return it. So, ""caveat emptor"" doesn't exist here because you cannot test the paper of this product prior to purchasing it. You can only rely upon the accuracy of the vender's description, which in this case, is in error. So. Beware. You have been warned."
4,Come To My Garden - 4.5 stars,"When I initially listened to this disc I was impressed by the lush production by Charles Stepney but was confused because it sounds nothing like Minnie's later work. Then I read the liner notes from her PETALS - GRTS HITS cd and discovered that she wanted a sound like the great Dionne Warwick/Burt Bacharach collabo and then understood where they were going with the project.For fans of Minnie Ripperton's work, this would be an excellent addition to your collection because it again displays her complete artistry as a singer. Her singing is effortless & beautiful without any hint of melisma that's so prevalent in today's r&b; music.My favorite tracks: WHENEVER, WHATEVER (love the horn solo & overall georgeous arrangement); LES FLEUR; ONLY WHEN I'M DREAMING (has a bossa nova arrangement during the intro that just sucked me into the whole song); CLOSE YOUR EYES AND REMEMBER and EXPECTING."
1,"Computed Tomography:Physical Principles, Clinical Applications, and Quality Contro","If I had depended on this book alone, I would not have passed the CT Registry. I bought this book originally and felt I wasn't getting what I needed, so I went to MIC and bought their course. That isn't perfect either, but between the two we had success. I didn't feel like the physics of CT was explained at the level that I or the people I was studying with could understand. I feel that this book needs to be more comprehensive. There was not nearly enough anatomy or how to figure dose, pitch, etc. Maybe it was just all over my head and I needed it explained in simpler terms. It is a good tool, but certainly not all the information you need to test."
4,CT physics text,"This text is very informative with lots of images to accompany the concepts, my only complaint is that it is very repetitive, it will tell you a concept is explained in a later chapter which is helpful but it will proceed to go on about the topic for multiple pages when you are not ready to learn about it yet, and will do that for multiple topics that come up and say the same thing and go into it for a couple pages in multiple chapters before you get to the chapter on that topic"
3,Bent peg on first use,"Given these were six bucks and free prime shipping I can't be too harsh, but one peg is almost bent in half after first use. I won't be taking these camping any more."
2,Playing DVDs,"I have installed this product, didn't work, uninstalled and then installed it again. It works periodically but cannot depend on it to play DVD everytime.This is with Windows Vista."
2,What a Disappointment!,"Too much of the same-old same old here - too much bickering, not enough plot, and the coincidence of the heroine crossing the country and winding up on the hero's doorstep was just too much to swallow. There were also too many typos. My impression is that this book was written in a hurry and needed a lot more work, especially with the hero."
4,Review,i first heard their song elements of rhyme on a late night music video show and was absolutely blown away. they have fresh beats and the japanese rapper (Boss the MC)is incredibly smooth.you have to give these guys a listen
3,Where's the beef?,The breezy style does not match the razor wit of the immortal Miss Davis. I longed for more on the turncoat daughter and the gimmee mom.
2,What?,"What on earth (or in heaven above) is the point of this book? As an avid reader of books about religion, and one who has read and many without agreeing with the research, philosophy or sentiment espoused, I bought this one thinking it would be similar to the level of research and reflection found in the writings of Elaine Pagels (The Gnostic Gospels) or Karen Armstrong (The Battle for God) or even the Jesus Seminar (The Five Gospels). Instead, I discovered that the research -- and I use the term loosely -- is hollow at best, quackery at worst. The authors, under the guise of research, are foisting their own (and if you will pardon my saying so) whacked-out spirituality upon the unsuspecting reader.Beyond that, they do not even write well; the organization of this book is a mess.Thumbs down. With all the interesting, thought-provoking books on religion and spiritulality available, this is not a ""must-have"" for the home libary."
4,ITS ALRIGHT!,"hi ,Im Hermione and i like to write a review on the above book.its nice and ive bought it using the information they have given.though i would like them also to write out the summary of the book so that the viewers have an idea of the book since all the books are about vasco da gama{the bks that i ordered}.In all other respects the site is goodthanking youHermione{this is not only a name in the harrypotter bk but also my real name}{im from britain and love harrypotter}"
2,nice to look at; too small to wear,"The booties are great with this set, the hat on the other hand doesn't come close to fitting our nearly 9 lb little boy."
5,Attractive TV stand,"This is an attractive, well-designed TV stand. It looks as good as the picture. It is easy to put together and came well-packaged, which is necessary because the two shelves are glass. I have a 50"" TV on it. My TV has a pedestal, so it could sit on a smaller stand, but this stand is a good match size-wise for the TV. I'm glad I got this one.I bought it here on Amazon (from Crutchfield) for $200, although it appears to be listed now at $375. I don't think I would have got it at that price.The stand is designed so you can thread your equipment cables down the back legs, then slide a black piece of cardboard alongside the backs of the legs to contain the cables. I didn't find this feature practical. It's hard to scrunch the cables down enough to slide the cardboard down, and some of my cables weren't long enough to go the extra distance. If I got longer cables and had more room to work with them and more patience, this feature would make the stand look more tidy."
2,"interesting, but not music as I expected","I discovered Quintron recently. Loved Swamp Tech. Bought Frog Tape thinking, ""Cool, more of the same!"" Not. Most of this is not musical at all. I don't mean that in a judgmental way, I mean really: it's not music. Sound effects. Experimental noodling. Playing around with eerie sounds. The cover encourages ""Play on Halloween night!"" Okay, there are a couple of cuts that are actual music, and some of the sounds are interesting, but you're not missing anything there. The longest piece is an actual recording of frogs. This is really for the Quintron fan who has everything else of his. It's interesting, and maybe even fun if you're in the right mood or altered state, but I was expecting...music. None of that damn-it's-hard-not-to-dance-in-my-cube music. So I'm disappointed. But I still love Swamp Tech so much that I'm off to buy some other Quintron. Just thought you oughta know what you're buying."
3,Southwest Food?,"It's okay, but missing a couple huge areas--hominy (both white and yellow)and black beans. I can't imagine chile without either or both. Much less Mexican soups. Sort of why I bought the book in the first place. Also needs expansion in prickly pear cleaning and uses, and pretty thin in chili pepper ID. So I was disappointed. There are some goodies, and could help people in other parts of the country learn a bit about what goes on here in the Southwest."
1,right on the expiration date,Looks better on the picture right on the expiration date and rock hard.Not the stuff i used to get. Only a couple pieces of licorice in the bag more hard candy would not recommend it.
5,so talented,I really enjoyed this cd - especially Rainy Day. I put it on repeat all the time! I would definitely picking up this cd if you want to hear the future of song writing!
2,No editing at all,"I was disappointed with this video. The excercises were ok......not great, but ok for a beginner. If you are an advanced stepper, skip this one. Also, it was very annoying and a bit unprofessional to watch the numerous mistakes in stepping and cueing that occur during the routines. I would like to have seen those edited out! I also think the 3 instructors could have rounded out the toning portion with a bit of abdominal workout......they basically work the same body parts..yes, it's a killer on the legs and ""buns"", but not a complete workout. Overall.......I would pass."
3,Tammy Buns of Steel 2000 VHS Tape,I have just stated this tape and only got into the first 10 minutes when I decided to watch it prior to doing it. It is a bit fast moving and the steps tend to be more complicated than I am accustomed to but I feel sure I will be able to get through it after review. More for intermediate and advanced stepper I think.
2,WWE's lack of Mercy 2005,"This is one of worst PPV shows of 2005,if not of all 2000's.None of the matches were great or even pretty good.The worst match was Bobby Lashley vs. Simon Dean which was awful and that's saying alot.The only thing that the WWE fans will remember this PPV for is that it was Eddie Guerrreo's PPV match before he past on.NOTHING ELSE!!! I give this event a 5 and a half out of 10."
5,The GOD Experiement,I was very happy with the condition of this item and the amount of time that it took the sender to get this item to me. This item arrived in the condition that the sender promised that it would arrive in.
2,Science neither supports nor threatens faith,"I recently enjoyed hearing Dr Schwartz at a public forum present his experiences leading to this book. Contrary to his claims, those experiences are nothing like ""scientifically rigorous"" investigation. I applaud that ""he argues that faith and science are not mutually exclusive"", but really, no one could rationally argue otherwise. I read the ""summary"" chapter and found several false assertions about math and physics, so I read no more. It could be that many things Dr Schwartz asserts are true, but it's unfair to science and to faith to assert also that the former supports the latter."
5,kid likes them,we let our kids pick out the design to decorate the rooms in their new house. My son loves these - and they haven't damaged the wall at all even though he's moved them around a few times.
4,"ra-aaate, see how we rate","has the album vrs of shine, one remix of shine, and two non album songs. nice to listen to every once in a while. nothing to write home about."
4,Really nice MP3 player,"I already had one MP3 player but wanted a second one. Can't survive workout at the gym without one!This one is perfect for the gym. It's small, about the size of a small pager. It comes with a belt clip, so you can hook it on your shorts. It also has a leather cover case, which I decided not to use because the player would fall off a little easier during my workouts.For starter, you can't be the price on this one. Already starts off with 128mb of memory which you can double with a Smart Media card.I have found downloading songs to be real easy. The sound also good for a little player, plus it has menu options for the type of music you like, rock, jazz etc.The only thing I really didn't care for are the ear bud phones. But you can also buy new headphones more to your liking.Overall, a very good buy for the price."
2,"Some Good Features, A Lot of Bad",If you turn up the volume it will start to get distorted and a lot of the times it locks up and you have to take the batteries out when it locks up to turn it off.
2,I didnt have a choice!!!,"This modem has one advantage and thats the proprietory ReadDSL Technology used by Paradyne. Other than that its firmware, feature set and support are pathetic.If you are locked into connecting to Paradyne/Zhone equipment using ReachDSL this modem is what you need, otherwise try other brands like Netgear or Dlink for more features, better interface, firmware stabilty and online support."
4,Middle of the Pack,"Not one of Robert Earl's best, but certainly not one of the worst. One of those CDs where you really like a few of the songs (Snowin' on Raton, Going Nowhere Blues, Wild Wind), some are worth listening to, and a few are just not really necessary (re-make of ""Road"" with bad singing). Worth buying if you REALLY dig REK, but would not recommend if you are looking for a starting point. For that I would purchase West Textures, Gringo Honeymoon for a start. Those are A+ albums."
3,Robert Earl Slowing Down,"As a longtime fan of Robert Earl, I was admittedly eager to buy when I heard he had a new album out. I found that 'Gravitational Forces' had a little less appeal than a lot of previous albums. I'll agree that REK on a bad day is better than a lot of artists on a good day, but the passion that comes out in so much of his music wasn't apparent in the new album. I was a fan of the rockin' REK that used to drive college audiences into a frenzy back in Austin. It seems that he's mellowed out a bit. The storytelling is still there in force, but, for example, 'Road Goes On Forever' was better left alone on 'No. 2 Live Dinner'. REK is still a fabulous singer and songwriter, but this album was a bit subpar (but he still kicks...live in his older age!!!)"
5,Simply the Best,"I have been listening to this recording since my parents played it in the living room when I was in the single digits. At this point it is so profoundly hard-wired into my brain that it is difficult to be objective about it; but every so often I hear another recording of La Boheme and realise why I love it so much. The cast is superb and it has the raw, youthfulness that La Boheme normally lacks. Most of all, this is Pavarotti at his very, very best, and in my view no tenor can even come close."
3,Tripod nice.,I'm happy with this tripod except for the leg release mechanism: I wish I bought the model with the levers to release the legs instead of the knobs. The knobs take too many turns to release - it takes too long and it's awkward to release the legs. The levers are much easier to use. It also didn't come with a tool to tighten the nuts. I'm having a difficult time finding the correct tool. The only tool I found is too large and heavy. The other model tripod comes with the tool attached to the tripod leg. The rest of the tripod is nice. I wouldn't buy this model.
4,EARLY SOLO VAN,"I compare this version of early Van to theExtended Live series (though these are notlive performances). What I mean is that thesound quality is superb, but lacks any writingcredits (while there are liner notes and musiciancredits).The stand out songs for me include: Brown EyedGirl, (it has never sounded as crisp as this version)He Ain't Give You None; T.B. Sheets; Madame George;Chick-A-Boom; and an alternate version of BrownEyed Girl, though granted, there's not much differencefrom the master take.Though the other songs aren't 5 Star, none are dogsand you'll find the 76+mins. of music go by quicklywith little complaint."
1,It took for ever to get here,and the vendor didn't have enough information to track the item. The worst experience on Amazon ever. I will never buy again from this vendor.
1,unexpecting,Found some empty capsules in the bottle. This is an expensive vitamin how can it be happen with poor QC issue. I called up customer service and she told me to send it back and reorder. They can not replace another bottle for me. This is not my fault so why shall I pay for the postage to send this bottle back???
2,Did nothing for my acne,"I took Herpanacine for 6 months and although it seemed to help my hair and nails grow and get stronger, it did nothing for my acne. I took 3 pills twice a day, religiously and I still have cystic acne. Sometimes people review things and they are hit or miss with taking things as directed, but I am not one of those people. When I commit to something, I do it exactly as directed to really see if it will help and to my dismay, this did not. Perhaps for light acne, this may work better (their website sure does have a lot of positive testimonials), but there are very few favorable reviews on Amazon and from personal experience, I can say that this is not the cure to your skin woes...the search continues!"
4,Just comments on quality of games peices,"I just got this game in the mail, haven't played it, but opened it up to check it out. This is published by Rio Grande Games, which usually just oozes quality, but for this game Rio Grande went El Cheapo (and this game sells for $65 full price, one would think having better quality) . The card board(paper cut outs) are extremely thin (about 1/2 normal size), I'm always careful punching out perforated cardboard pieces so they dont rip, and one the the circle split into two pieces. The bag holding the cubes had been cut at the bottom so the pieces were free to roam in the box while the indented card board insert was already ripped and folded over. They only include two bags, one for all the cubes and one for spinners, luckily I have extra bags for organization. For some reason these bottomless bags, cut in the bottom, seem to be a trend lately, anyone notice this as well?"
5,Into Eternity do it again,"Into Eternity have long been one of my favorite bands. When Buried in Oblivion came out, I was simply overwhelmed at how great that album was. Excellent vocals, guitars, drums, everything was fantastic. The band then went through some lineup changes and got new vocalist Stu Block. I had the chance to see them live with him and was very impressed. When The Scattering of Ashes came out, I almost immediately decided that it was better than their previous efforts...and coming from me, that's saying something. Tim Roth is a musical genuis and he shines on this album as do all the band members. This album is easily one of the best albums of 2006. Check it out and if Into Eternity ever have a show near you, check them out live, theyre all really great and talented guys and deserve all the support they can get."
3,plano 757,"I am not totally pleased with this tackle box, one reason the top access allows anything inside to get so hot I had to dip it in the water before I could use it after burning my fingers. The second is the front door does not fit tight at the bottom when closed."
4,seems to be working,I take 1 tbs per day and have noticed a difference in my joint pain decreasing. only been taking 1 month so I'll have to see if anything else improves
5,Saw faster results than expected,"We had a bad flea infestation in the yard this summer. Sprinkled this product all over the yard and saw dramatically less fleas within the first week. It's now been exactly two weeks since the application, and this morning we walked into 'the danger zone' and walked away without a single flea attached to our pants...what a relief! The icing on the cake is knowing this was non-toxic so we were able to murder the fleas in the masses without doing my harm to the wildlife and other animals that hang out in our yard. We love this product!!!"
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This so isnt like the product is described at all. I have used Diatomacous Earth food grade before and it worked for everything. This stiff is useless. Its been well over two weeks and it has had no effect. Dont waste your money. You might as well fling flower everywhere, you would get the same results. Seriously buy another brand or something. This stuff does NOT work!!!"
1,D. E. is messy from the start,I should have known the price was too good. The package had product spilling out before I opened it. The box had powder all over when I opened it and it just got worse. The bag of D. E. had a clear bag over it but even that had product all over inside and out. It was a mess!! I had powder all over me just getting it out of the box and the clear bag off to try and get the inside bag open to put it in some other container. Had the bag not leaked I would have been happy but I think it would be worth to pay the extra for the product since I lost so much in just getting it out it would be more cost effective.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Kurt Busiek's Astro City is told from a slightly different viewpoint, some of the time. Often we are looking through the eyes of a normal denizen of the City rather than one of the heroes. This book introduces some of the important super characters though, and although homages to Superman, Wonder Woman, the Fantastic Four and others, they do stand on their own."
1,Game does not work,"They shut down the servers for this game and now you cannot play it even when you insert the CD into the drive. Don't play it, don't buy it. Save your money."
5,Ruby 6L6 GC MSTR matched quad,Well packaged. Each tube labeled with test number but did notmatch the box it came in. That's ok they were very well matchedand sound great.
2,Waste of money,"I have to disagree with everyone else here. Now just to make things clear, I am no newbie club kid who needs deep dark progressive to make me happy. But this album just straight up bored the hell out of me. It is absolutely nothing like what you would expect from a Deep Dish album. Ive lived through the 80s and have no need of a hyped up CD filled with remixes of our favorites from those days. Everyone is well due their opinions so if you liked the CD all the more power to you, but for those of you out there that are Deep Dish fans please listen to this first for it is not what you are probably expecting."
5,East Watercolor,"At no time in my life did I ever have the desire, let alone theability to paint a picture, except possibly a house.For whatever reason, I have the book and find myselfaddicted to following the easy steps the author has compiled.Once I had started reading chapter one, I found myself workingto the end of the book in one sitting, which gave me theconfidence that I certainly needed to get started with thepaint. After several mishaps, I moved through the book whilepainting and I gained even more confidence. Although I am justa beginner in the art world, I find this book easy to lean onso to speak in moving from one area of the painting to theother. I consider it a must for anyone wanting to get startedin the watercolor field of art. If it helped me, it certainlycan help anyone, even those of us who have trouble drawing astraight line."
3,No CD with VS add-in,"Just bought the 2nd edition and I was looking forward to the CD with the Visual Studio .Net doc'n plug-in, but when I received the book it didn't have the CD. I called O'Reilly and customer support told me that they had decided not to include the CD, and Amazon just has an old image of the cover (O'Reilly has the ""old"" cover image too then!).I had installed the add-in for other O'Reilly nutshell books (ADO.Net and Windows Forms) and found them to be useful, and thus I was disappointed that this book is not including the CD. Perhaps O'Reilly is planning to sell a plug-in for all of the FCL, and that is why the CD was pulled..."
5,Joy of Falling in Love With Songs,"I am having the joy of falling in love with one song after another on this CD. Kirsten Falke's pure voice is both beautiful and inspiring. The arrangements are so different that each song is fresh. I take this CD with me when I walk, and I find that I enjoy every song, and listen to it from start to finish. This CD is the perfect accompaniment for this time of solitude. When I listen to the CD at home, I find myself playing a song over and over again, and it is a different song each day. The songs resonate at deeper and deeper levels as I come to know them better. I have been playing this CD constantly for several weeks now, and I feel that I am just getting to know it. It feels like it is going to be an all-time favorite."
1,Save your money.,"I was initially pleased with the ease and low cost of this unit. But, as they say, you get what you pay for. In two weeks time I found myself constantly interrupting my workouts to turn it back on. It would just die, for no apparent reason. Sometimes it would last 30 minutes. Sometimes 30 seconds. I changed the batteries. I checked the menu options. It made no difference. For its replacement, I've paid more attention to the reviews and less to the price tag."
4,"Spectre, unicorns, etc.","I've read books 1 through 9 in this series, and found this one of the deepest and most entertaining of them. It attempts to deal with Starbuck's weariness with war as well as the weariness of the population of the 12 colonies being in the depth of a thousand year war. The telepathic unicorns did not turn me off and I actually thought Starbuck's connection with one of them was carried off very well. Spectre was also a standout. This character was fleshed out more than he was in the tv show (and even in that episode, regardless of how well received it was, Spectre was one of the best guest characters to come along in BG).The Larson/Thurston novels were by far the best. (The Larson/Goulart novels were terrible, the writing horrible.) And this is the best of the first four Larson/Thurston's. Thurston co-wrote some or all of the books between 11 and 14 also, but I haven't gotten to those yet. But this is definitely the best of the first four."
3,Camera bag tight for the C3000 camera,The camera bag included in this kit is pretty tight when you put a C3000 Olympus camera in it. I was rather disappointed with that.
5,Best on the market,"One of my hobbies is kitchen knives; a corollary is knife sharpeners. I've bought a dozen or two, and tried many more. This is the best of those I've tried. It addresses all the issues. There are three stones with three angles, giving the compound edge that experts prefer (this proves it superior to the carbide sharpeners, with a single angle). The stones are wet (water bath), producing a finer set of cuts, and a more durable edge. It's not motor operated, substantially reducing cost. Global produced a similar sharpener, but with only two edge angles, and has raised the price. My knives include Global, Forstner (Victorinox), Wüsthof, Gerber, Fiskars, and Brieto (my favorite, an extraordinary Japanese knife). All have superior metallurgy. With each of them, this sharpener has produced the sharpest and most durable edge. One of those technologically superior products that doesn't come along very often."
3,good but a little shakey,"The size and ability to have the mouse on the keyboard tray (rather than a fold out platform or on the desktop)is a plus, and there is alot of flexibility in adjusting the position. The tray is a little shakey when typing though, I think due to the center bracket design for adjsutments. It's a trade-off but a good value for the cost."
4,Wowie!,"So, I stumbled upon this band using Pandora and was glad. I love this sort of music, sort of arhythmic jumbled beauty, what they call math rock I guess. Obviously these guys are very talented, this is very technical stuff.My only detraction, which I don't even know that it is one or if it is just part of the uniqueness of the album (reflected by the female T names), but it can be hard to distinguish between songs. Also, there's about an 85% chance that your loved ones will not understand the music, they'll probably hate it. It takes a special kind of person to get Captain Beefheart, same goes for Yowie."
3,Not exactly what I expected it to be...,"The first half of this book is great for someone interested in learning what to expect before getting pregnant. It's easy to read and extremely informative. I enjoyed that part of it very much. Howevere, once you reach the center of the book the entire rest of the book is about infertility and ways you can get pregnant if either you or your spouse are found to have problems. I'm sure this book would become very helpful if that were to happen, but considering that I haven't even started trying to get pregnant...that part of the book did not interest me at all."
3,OK but confusing menu options,"While it holds a lot of MP3's and has good audio quality, the menu options are a bit cumbersome. For instance, if you want to see all your file folders you have to hold down on the navigation button and then somehow scroll with the left button. It's really hit or miss. Sometimes I can get it the work and other times I can't...gets a little frustrating. I understand that they want to have fewer buttons, but it's hard to scroll through the folders. Other than the buttons, I like the mp3 player...probably not the best option for someone who is starting out with the technology of an mp3 player because it's not all that user friendly."
3,"A nice dissertation, if you are ready to read one","The book is a doctoral dissertation, so it is quite dry, I have to warn you. However, it has some interesting points on classical Christian developments on sin and holiness, particularly in relation to different sexes. By introducing the category of gender into the analysis of Wesleyan-Holiness hamartiology, Leclerc connects patristic sources with the Holiness movement's conceptualization of `entire devotion'. She argues that not only did the female ascetics of the late fourth century, the women of British Methodism, and the women of the nineteenth-century Holiness movement `transcended' their limited female roles, but they also occupied their own subjectivity. I'd say it is an intriguing combination of historical investigation and constructive theological reflection."
2,Missing Parts,"I was missing the ""Seat"" and ""Seat Post"" parts when I received the package. I don't understand how a significant part like a seat could be missing from the box. I'm still waiting for the manufacturer Pacific Cycle to get back to me if they can send me a replacement part. Very disappointed with this bike."
2,Melt down,"I'm hoping I won't have the same problem as the other reviewer, but I'm dreading the worst. I bought my first one three days ago, charged it, loaded it took it on a road trip and it froze 10 min into the trip. I returned it today and got a new one. Here's crossing my fingers.....This first part of the review was written the first week of January. I guess the date of the post changes when you edit it.Further update 1/20/07 .... Don't buy this. It doesn't hold a charge at all. Dies within 1-2 hours at *best.* I don't even use it much and the display keeps fritzing out. I don't really care about seeing the images, but it doesn't bode well for what's going on with the rest of it.1/25/07 Well, the second one died about a week after I got it and that's it no more - I'll get something else. I can't seem to change my ""star"" rating any more, but I'd give it a negative value."
2,Rather disappointing,Creative was known for customer service in the past but not today. I purchased one of these only to find it is not Vista compatible. I had to restore my system from the backup disks after trying to install this. The system crashed frequently after installing it. Emails to Creative did no good. The device itself crashes about once every two weeks. I carry a paper clip to reset it in the case with it. All in all it is disappointing.
1,Be careful it's compatiable,"I bought this item for my very tech savy son. He downloaded the software onto his computer, which has Windows Vista, and Windows Media player 11. After several attempts he was never able to put any music on the thing. The product registration still won't go away from the screen of the computer after removing the software. I sent it back and bought the more expensive but more familiar ipod. He's not had any problem with the ipod. I don't know why the Zen didn't work. But I am grateful that Amazon took the Zen back and refunded the full purchase price. I give them 5 stars for that!"
1,Kathy,"Creative Zen V Plus 4 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Blue)I will tell you that if you say this product is 3,4,or 5*,Then you are evidently looking at the wrong product. This is the most awful product I have ever bought from amazon and I have bought a bunch. It is now sitting on my floor hooked up to the wall outlet and just flickering almost as if it was in its final death throes.. Its been hooked up to the outlet for several hours and it still is in red. I think its just about on its way to creative heaven. Unless you have plenty of dough and can easily purchase another stay away, it is poisonous"
2,Here's the Major Problem.........,"The software doesn't work, the computer doesn't recognize the unit... .these can all be fixed. I have had my Zen since October, and like everyone else I initially fell in love with it. I really loved the fact that I could download all my 2-year-olds music to make car trips so much easier! I loved the size, the Outlook sync feature, and the FM tuner.However, it does keep freezing up when you disconnect it from a power source. And this time putting a tiny pin in the reset hole to hit the hidden button won't do anything. It won't shut off, and it's frozen on the beginning screen- it won't go anywhere else, won't hook up with the computer, and repeated attempts to reset are not working.It's very frustrating to not be able to access the reset button- one reason I think I will be moving over to the tried and true Ipod. Creative really needs to work on this major design flaw!Don't buy this unless you want to be really frustrated!"
1,"Good at first, now very disappointed w/ 2 of them (mine and a friend's)","I researched this product pretty well, I thought, and bought one for me and one for a friend not quite a year ago. I liked the styling and features. I loved it at first and used it regularly, but treated it well (no banging). My friend just starting having problems w/ the volume going all the way to the top and not being able to adjust it. Mine kept stopping and saying something like ""rebuilding media library"" and then after 10 mins it would work again. Now I have the black screen and it won't restart. It did this for no reason. By looking on the Net I see that MANY others have had this same problem.I would look for another player. Very disappointed esp. b/c I thought buying an item w/ almost no moving parts would guarantee a long life of use. About a month ago I'd recommended this to a friend; now I feel guilty, like theirs, too, will collapse for no reason soon."
1,battery....ugg,"got it, returned it. I can't deal with a non replaceable battery. That's a deal breaker,..that's why I won't buy ipods. The Zen micro was perfect,..so I thought this would be an upgrade into gadget heaven. I use mp3 players constantly,..not only can U not change the battery when it runs out,..the thing takes FOREVER to charge! I am disappointed with Creative for this horrific error in judgement. Will get a sansa instead."
1,Constant connection problems,"This player has constant connection problems, and either the software or the player constantly freezes. I've tried resetting the player, and that unfreezes it.. Until you try to download again.. This is a headache, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it as a gift for anyone who doesn't enjoy spending hours on a computer trying to get it to work right."
2,"Music worked fine, everything else not so much...","This was my first MP3 player. Unfortunately didn't work out so well. I had no trouble initially getting songs on the player, the playlist feature worked well. Unfortunately, after about 20 uses, the sliding power/on off button came off. Because there's a tiny piece which connects inside the player, there was no way to reattach and have work --- so I had pay $30 plus shipping to send and have a new unit sent out. My second unit, I only maybe used a MAXIMUM of 10 times before the screen went black. I was able to remember how to ""navigate in the dark"" to get to my playlists, but obviously not very ideal. In lieu of sending back a third time, I cut my losses and purchased another brand.I had no problem with the sound quality or ease of use of this player -- actually my new player's sound isn't quite as good as this was. Based on my own experience, I can't recommend this player."
4,Changed My Life,"I've owned my Zen for 7 months now and use it everyday. I have it about half full - some music - a couple of audiobooks at a time - some photos. It has only frozen on me 3 times in all those months. I love the little size, the no scratch case and the ease of the software included. What I don't like is that I can't reorganize my files once they are loaded. Once in a while I'll misplace a song and I can't find it. Also I broke off the on and off switch when my nail got caught on it while I was exercising. I still can get it on and off using a pen - but I never did like that switch. I like the ""joystick"" better than the ipod navigation pad. I bookmark my audiobooks but I can't get it to rewind if I need too. Still for the $$ that I paid, its just what the doctor ordered."
2,Great...While it works,"I got the Zen V and I was very happy with it when I first got it, but after only 3 months the screen just went blank. I spoke to the two people who had the Zen when this happened and they told me that I am lucky it even turns on, because both of their Zens stopped working completly. I DO NOT recomend this product. An Ipod is the same price and from what I have heard a lot more reliable."
1,Creative Zen V Plus - CAUTION - DO NOT BUY,"Creative products are absolutely non-durable. This one broke just after first month. The display turned dark with faint red letters. Many people have same problem (search google). The product should be recalled. This is my second creative. My Last one was Creative Zen Micro which broke too just after first year so no warentee. Its headphone pin came loose. That too is suffered by many people (Search Google here too). Creative has only 3 months of labor warantee and products break so you will have to shell lot of money even if your hardware warantee is 1 year, what a trap!"
4,It's great -- when it works.,"I bought this item (rebuilt) almost two years ago because it had -- in addition to the standard MP3 player -- the ability to record ANY sound source through its Input jack. It served me well for a little more than a year, but then abruptly worked in play mode only. I've bought a second (rebuilt) unit to replace it, but it records maybe 60% of the time. I'm never sure it's recording a file, or just going through the motions. It's unfortunate that this unit is out of production, and only second-hand inventory is available now."
1,don't do it!,"Screen disappeared in the first 3 months...sent it in for repair after numerous support calls. Got it back with no further warranty, within the 9 months it failed again. Support would not honor the repair. Not a good product, not a good company."
1,acts really weird,It freezes. Couldn't even turn it off. I let the power run out then charged it and it started to work again.
1,Piece of Junk!!!!!,"Looks good, easy to add / delete songs videos photos etc, thats about the only good things about this product. Used it about 4 times since i bought it off Amazon, of the 4 times, it froze on me twice, once it freezes none of the functions work, cannot switch it off etc. the only way to get it working again is to reset the unit, which can be done only by a paper clip / pin (which is difficult to get on the subway or bus). Cannot return the product to Amazon as its past 30 day period, so stuck with it as long as it works.... thinking about contacting the manufacturer, may not have much luck there either.Remember to buy a box of pins along with this unit, looks like you will need it often."
5,awesome product,"I got my zen for christmas and it is the best mp3 player i've ever had. I had the Ipod nano for a year and the zen just blew it out of the water. Its affordable, durable, and has many features. I have a 4 gb zen for the same price as a 2gb ipod. Now that's a deal!!"
1,Not worth the trouble,"Despite an enticing price and feature set, the ZEN V Plus falls far short of competitors such as the iPod. Both me and my brother received a ZEN for Christmas about 2 years ago, and it wasn't long before the screen on mine died, and I had to send it in for warranty repair ($25+, even though the device was in warranty!!). After some ridiculously awful dealings with tech support, I got my player back, with a new screen. Shortly afterwards, right after the warranty expired, my brother's ZEN's screen died.I ended up getting an iPod the next august (as part of a special promo deal with my Macbook) and it really was worth the slight extra cost. I've had no problems with it (other than the shoddy included headphones) and it is really a much better product over all.Although there are some very nice features on this player, I'd have to say that due to the experiences I have had with it, and my brother's player, I will not be purchasing any Creative mp3 players in the future."
3,Review,"This player works but it crashes and needs to be plugged into computer to be brought back up with its reset button. Screen is hard to see in daylight and sometimes impossible to see. Sound quality is good. Case broke where lanyard is attached, I was shocked. I have to say I would not buy this player again along with the Ipod which I found this is not up to the task of being used in a mobile situation. I have an old creative zen big 40gb hd model that has out lived 2 ipods and now is still in better shape than this one. It still is working today but I do not have much hope for it at this point.UPDATE: This player is now dead as I had fallen asleep with it in my pocket with the headphones. It seems that one of the ear buds crushed the lcd while in the pocket. I am very displeased by this and it seems to me if you can have a cell phone last 3 to 4 years of every day use why can i not get a mp3 player last 1 year of intermittent use."
4,I love it!,"I first saw the Zen V Plus in Glamour Magazine, and thought, ""interesting, I wonder how it compares to the ipod"". My brother got it for me this past Christmas, and now I don't go anywhere without it. I love the size and how idiot proof it is...i'm not very smart when it comes to gadgets, but even the downloading cds on to it is childs play. The only downside is, the first time i used it, it froze on me and I had to wait for the battery to die to get it to work. Other than that, its great. And it hasn't happened since. Buy this product! Its worth every penny you spend on it."
1,Not a good experience,I had the Creative Zen Plus 4 GB less than a month when it simply stopped working and I had to return it.
1,Questionable,"Questionable functionality. Joy stick was frozen, unable to get it to release, don't know if unit plays, since can't access menu. Returned to Creative, replaced, second unit frozen also. Creative refuses to refund money, only offers support to continue troubleshooting. I am unhappy camper."
1,Another broken player...,"After following startup directions exactly, charging for the requisite 6 hours, using the Creative software installed on my computer, my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback. Today, when trying to shut it down, the entire device froze. Tried to restart it, followed the steps to reset it... no luck. Now, I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery. Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player.Also, a note to other potential buyers, the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand."
2,An apologist for prayer book reform,"Mr. Lee never bothers to explain why the Cramner version is so but simply assumes readers should agree with him. (I don't necessarily disagree with Prayer Book reform efforts, but don't find a compelling rationale here.) Our church book group was very disappointed in this book. It did not live up to the title."
1,"Philips is an awful, awful company",I had this TV for about 9 months when a buzzing noise started and the TV picture started blacking out. The TV was still covered under the 1 yr manufacturer's warranty. I had a Philips authorized service center look at the TV and deem that the power supply needed to be replaced. It has been a nightmare getting the TV back. My TV is basically being held hostage by Philips. The part is on back order with no end date in sight. They are the absolute worst Customer Service group that you could ever encounter. They give you nothing but canned non answers and are totally uncooperative and not helpful. I am still without my TV and it has been over 5 weeks now. Philips is one of the worst companies that I have ever dealt with and I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase this or any other TV from them.
1,Bad collection of poorly recorded pieces.,"This is a list of old and poorly recorded pieces from different periods of Rampal's career. Many of the original records sounded better than they do in this record, one wonders why. Different composers from different periods have been put in this record with no other rationale than being played by the same soloist. A very poor and confusedly assembled collection which does not make a favor to an otherwise remarkable interpreter."
4,GreenSense Diatomeceous Earth,"Product worked after a few weeks and the animals seemed happier. Killed fleas in the house over a period of three to four weeks without using on animal flea killers. I liked the product for it's organic nature and non harmful properties to my animals, children and home. A little hard to use in the house at first. I recommend putting it in places animals sleep, not everywhere as it gets in the air and makes a layer of itself all over everything."
3,"Big, Beautiful BBQ!","I have made slow-cooked short ribs in this a couple of times, and it is always fabulous!!The only negative thing about this is its size - it is HUGE! Make sure you have a lot of space to store this when it is not in use...it takes up a lot of room!"
5,WE LAUGHED,"Boy oh boy, do I remember this one. We didn't know what we were about to see when we went to the movie theater to see the T.A.M.I. show. There was Marvin, there were the Supremes, there was Smokey and the Miracles doing that crazy monkey routine and then there was James Brown. And then, we saw the beginning of a phenomenon the Rolling Stones. We didn't know. But, there was something about these guys. All we could say is 'Not Bad'. ""but did you see him try to steal James' moves"""
1,Big dissapointment!,"This seems to be a great idea with a lack of follow-through. I purchased the Heath-Zenith SL-6028-BZ along with an SL-6005-BK5 remote control. After replacing the dead battery that came with the remote control and installing the light in a very difficult location to get to, it would not operate at all with either the supplied motion sensor or with the remote control. After verifying the codes, I started experimenting and discovered that the light would operate if either the remote control or the motion sensor were activated within about a foot of the light. Needless to say, this defeats the whole purpose of having remotely located sensors or remote controls. Prior to purchasing the Heath-Zenith unit, I also have tried a similar unit made by Cooper. It worked for one day and then quit. Like I said in the beginning, this seems to be a great idea with a lack of follow-through. These are pretty simple devices, it shouldn't be too difficult to make them work too!"
1,Don't buy this player,"I recently bought this player, charged it and played the first song and it sounded great. That was it. The player froze on the first recording never to be used again. Do not buy from this company, their MP3 player is crap and so is their customer service."
3,Thanks for ruining it Amazon.,"I heard about this book in passing on a different site. I sought it out and read the review...it simply gives away the entire plot. WTF? Thanks for ruining it Amazon.Don;t you just hate that sht? It's the same as those stupid DVD producers who spoil movies by slapping a 5 second loop of iconic scenes onto the intro screen, ala Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. You know what...I need to go write a DVD review."
5,Wonderful,"Canetti's incomparable masterpiece is an inferno of dialectical confrontations-confrontations between the life of the mind and the slow, degenerate ruin of the modern world. Canetti's vision is at once hellish and comic. Kien, a brilliant Sinologist and lover of books lives only for his library and his work until he marries his crass house-keeper, a woman who systematically destroys him. Kien is thrown into a macabre underworld of hunchbacks and prostitutes in this uncanny metaphysical circus. Canetti's vision accounts for the strangely satanic character of genius, and yet is able to see the rise of the brutish fascism that was to envelop Europe. This is high modernism at its peak."
2,"Funny in places, but not in others","Carlin hasn't lost his bite, that's for sure. His interesting perspective on life provides many laughs, some of them quite hilarious. However, I found some of riffs unfunny, possibly at the expense of being overly preachy. Some people might argue that I just don't ""get"" him, but I do. I understand Carlin's shtick, and I've often found him hilarious, but it seems some of these bits just suffered from his pontificating too much for a comedy album. Personally, I look to Carlin for laughs, not social commentary (at least, not at the expense of humor), and in that respect, I think most anyone would be better served by any of Carlin's other efforts."
1,Carlin has become a bitter old man and is no longer funny,"I saw Carlin perform this material live is Las Vegas last month and was very dissapointed. No one in the audience laughed in the SHORT performance. The audience, myself included, was glad it ended as soon as it did. Even some of the material that I heard before and found funny, no longer seemed funny. He went way beyond being sarcastic. He was bitter, and hateful, and resentful. Save your money and avoid this album AT ALL COSTS. You'll thank me!!!!"
1,Don't waste your precious money,"Don't waste your money!This was my first listen to George Carlin's 'work'.All I see in this is an ingenuine attempt at satirism.This guy obviously got all the material for this album fromBill Hicks (who didn't sell out, unlike georgie boy here).If your curious, download some tracks and if you like it, but it.Just don't waste your money without trying it out first."
3,Paul McCartney - Decent Early 90's Album,"Paul McCartney has had a very uneven career over the years. He has put out some great stuff as well as some pure crap. This album is one of his better ones from the early 90's, although like most of his studio albums it does suffer from inconsistency. Some of this album rocks, some of it is cheesy, some of it is spacey, and some mushy. Paul is in fine voice throughout and the musicians were all members of his touring band so they worked well together. The really good stuff includes, Hope Of Deliverance, Mistress And Maid, The Lovers That Never Were, Get Out Of My Way, and my personal favorite Wine Dark Open Sea. The rest of the album is all ok, but nothing spectacular to my ears. Overall this is a pretty decent effort from Paul and although not essential would make a nice addition to anyone's collection."
5,Suv Shocks,The shocks works as advertised. My Explorer is more stable than with the original. This shock is great for top heavy SUV's.
5,Perfect,"This is the perfect holster for my Beretta PX4 Storm Handgun. I have had the handgun for awhile, but did not have a holster. It fits snuggly, but with a little work the firearm comes in and out with ease, but does not fall out. Great product for any PX4 Storm owner."
1,WAY Overpriced.,"Way overpriced for what it is. I'll buy Atlas next time. Also, this is NOT a toy, as listed by Amazon. Probably toxic."
4,Deodato's Final 70's musical installment,"This was Deodato's final 70's album and a very good one. It includes some amazing tracks such as ""Tahiti Hut"", ""San Juan Sunset"", ""Chariot Of The Gods"" and the title track ""Love Island"".This album includes performances by Earth Wind and Fire. this album is also very relaxing and takes you places far away when you hear it. You actually wish you were on that very Love Island that he's playing about. If you get a chance to get a hold of this album on CD definitely check it out. you will not be disappointed."
5,Amazing historical fiction,"I loved this book! Alexandra Ripley is one of my favorite authors, and she didn't disappoint with The Time Returns. Her history is impeccable, and her characters make you feel as if you were in Florence during the Renaissance."
1,DID NOT FIT,"The description was not correct- it did not fit the G-shock Casio watch as stated, it would have been good value if it fit."
1,does not fit g-force watch as advertised,i have a g-force timex which needs a special band. this was advertised to fit it but it does not...
1,It doesn't fit G-Shock!,A great deal isn't if it doesn't work! But now I've got a watchband that would cost more to send back than to just keep it!
3,"The band swings cat, but I can't get used to Bunkley's voice","Cat this cd could have been so much better if there was a different lead vocalist. However, his voice in ""Man With The Hex"", ""Caviar & Chitlins"" and ""Spanish Fly"" I think is appropriate and can get any club swingin'! I would like to see some of these songs sung by a different vocalist like, ""Lover Lies"" because I love that song but his voice isn't right for that song."
5,Great Product...,"There was 3"" Slatwall/Storewall already installed in the house we were renting. I had searched high and low for accessories with not much luck...The Home Derpo associates brushed me off like I had no idea what I was talking about. I hopped on Amazon and saw these guys. They are a very well made product...It is nice to see a quality item still being produced. I just recently moved and took these with us without the 3"" Slatwall/Storewall and screwed them right into the garage studs and they still work like they should. Great Product!"
5,Great Sci-Fi book,This book is a great sci-fi book. It has a lot of twist and turns. It kept me interested. I highly recommend this book.
2,Not up to Harry's standard,"Mr Harry ususally writes well crafted stories, but, this one seems just a little rushed, and much more implausible than his other stories. I realize that you have to suspend belief to a certain degree to enjoy technothrillers, but this is quite a stretch. The reason that the best technothirllers are so good, is because they have some degree of believability. This story just didn't have that. Many other reviewers have made the same comments that I would make, so I won't repeat them.I hope Harry's next offering is better"
3,Paperbark Maple Seeds,These seeds didn't grow trees. It's a shame because my husband and I wanted to grow this tree from bottom up and not purchase a full grown tree to start. We followed the directions for getting the seeds to germinate and then planted exactly the way as described. No luck - all 8 seeds we planted didn't grow even the smallest shoot. We were very disappointed. We've since bought a lovely paperbark maple and planted it around the outside of our new patio. It will look lovely in the spring.
2,Why so wimpy playing - we know you can do better,"I don't understand why Schiff gets relatively good acclaim for this recording. He certainly can do better, as he shows in his French Suites recording which is the best there is! He certainly plays less boring on this record than Perahia's new editions, but you should try Horszowsky, Feltsman or (of course) Gould before deciding to go with Schiff on this one."
2,Not for the novice!,"Poorly illistrated an much too much text for a relatively simple project. Not worth it's price. If you are a novice interested in basic cabinet building, I highly recommend ""Better Homes and Gardens Step-By-Step Cabinets & Shelves"". It covers everything from tools to lumber to construction and installation, including countertops and drawer construction. It's a MUCH better book than this one! Don't waste you money on this book!"
3,A good text for the intermediate woodworker,"This solid text describes a plan of attack for building your own kitchen cabinets. Cary describes some types of wood, planning the space, constructing some basic pieces, and finishing. However, it is not a complete reference for the beginner. Wood selection, an important step in cabinet making, gets only cursory coverage and types and uses of woods are not covered in detail. In addition, while joinery is covered well, actual methods of attaching (nail, screw, glue) were not described in enough detail for the novice.Definitely a good text if you are experienced in woodworking and want to tackle a larger project."
4,A very cool puppet,"I bought this as a funny gift for an adult, and he loved it. I wouldn't say it's very durable for young children, but as puppets go, this one is adorable. We actually knew exactly what we were getting before purchasing since we checked it out at FAO Schwartz in NYC last spring. I was happy to find it at a better price on line at Amazon."
2,Not really worth it.,"I was quite disappointed when I got this. What the description doesn't tell you is that it is all in black and white. The pages feel like it was just made out of some paper from your printer, not higher quality paper like all my other drawing books. Some of the images inside are nice and a good reference/ inspiration, but I wish I hadn't spent money on it."
4,Exactly as advertised. Just a little too expensive.,"The product is well built, light and very useful. It doesn't seem like they need to be as expensive as they are, but if the price seems fair to you you won't be disappointed. They come as advertised."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to upbeat, unique rendering of a variety of gospel songs performed by the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. As you can see by the selections shown on this CD set (2 CDs), several songs are repeated; namely, What A Friend we Have in Jesus, Wholy Holy, My Sweet Lord & Precious Memoris. I don't understand why these songs were duplicated on both CDs. I found the introductions and comments provided by Reverands Cleveland and Franklin annoying and unnecessary. I just wanted to hear the music. The highlights were How I Got Over, Amazing Grace and Wholy Holy. Otherwise, I wish I didn't waste my money. I learned my lesson though: Just because the artist is spectacular, doesn't mean the album is."
3,Dissapointing...,"I brought this cd because i lost my copy of the original amazing grace cd. But when i got amazing grace: the complete recordings, i was very dissapointed, most because my favorite songs on the original recording; Old landmark and climbing higher mountain, have been replaced by different versions, which does not showcase Aretha`s vocal skills as they do on the original recording. Although the packaging and booklet are great, i would much rather reccomend the original cd, at lest if you want to hear Aretha at her very best:)"
3,Old Books--New Title,"I love to read Nora Roberts. I have several of her books. When I bought Table for Two I expected a a good read. However, when I started to read it it seemed old-fashioned and out-dated for Nora Roberts. The writing seemed more like a Harlequin Romance than a great Nora Roberts. I then noticed that it was two of her old books that were put together under a new name. I was very disappointed. I really felt cheated because I thought I was buying something new."
5,Perfect for my Craftsman Snowblower,"This was the perfect replacement shear pin for my Craftsman snow blower. I don't often need one of these, but this four pack gave me the spares I needed."
1,Mediocre,"These spoons were mailed from San Francisco in packing that came directly from China. They were packed in Chinese newspaper rather than bubble wrap, placed in an envelope and put through US mail. As a result, one spoon was broken in pieces when it arrived. Each broken spoon deducts from the bargain and increases the cost of the remaining ones since there's no point in the hassle of returning something at this price. I was willing to overlook it, but since using the spoons I'm really not impressed. They're too small for ice cream, the thickness of the spoon itself makes it uncomfortable to place in your mouth because it makes contact with your teeth, and they have no significant depth for soups. They also feel like they'd break if dropped in the sink or on the counter. I'm not glad I bought them."
5,Great sound,"I bought this same model from best buy installed it with ease in a 95 Nissan pickup, I used the factory mounts and it all in and it worked great. Best radio I have had. Just need to put better speakers in the truck"
4,Good CD/radio but display not bright,"Purchased this unit on sale at Fry's for about $79 including installation for my wife's 2002 Civic. This relaced a four-year-old JVC player,that replaced a six-year-old factory player. Both had progessive problems that made them hard to use (they did not just stop working). We have had this unit for several months and my wife - who only uses the radio and (mostly) the CD player - considers it to be a good easy-to-operate radio/CD player. The only problem is the display which, at it's highest setting, is not bright enough to be seen during the daylight hours with sunshine. Otherwise it is a good player for the price."
1,Garbage,Receiver seemingly works when it wants to. Doesnt keep time. Runs extremely hot. Sounds pretty good when working. Maybe I just got a bad deck but I doubt it. Its just not a quality product.
4,Product works,This is my first purchase of this product. I purchased it to reduce the ant population around our house and to use as a dusting medium for my chickens. So far I am pleased with the results!
3,Good but Missing Over 1 Pound of DE,"After weighing the whole bag of Diatomaceous Earth including the paper bag and plastic bag around it the total equates to 48.7 lbs. What's that all about? The bag is missing more than a pound of Diatomaceous Earth. There was none that spilled out in the box that it came in so, where is it?"
5,DE Powder,I've used this powder for three years now and have found it pretty effective in eliminating insects that get into your home
3,Run one size small,"Unlike other Cobian flip flops that I own, these seem to run a size small. I have other Cobians in an 11, but had to return these to get a 12. Strange."
1,Did not recieve recording part of book,"When I ordered this book I was under the impression it came with some sort of recording either cassette or cd as an accompanyment to the book. In the first section of the book, labeled introduction on page 4; it says there is an accompanying recording. I specifically ordered this for the inclusion of the recording. So I am not satisfied with this transaction. Whether it is purposefully deceptive or it was an error. I am missing what I think is an important part of this order.Katalin Pecora"
1,OH PLEASE!,"Why oh why oh why does Kreskin continue to embarrass himself? Being a professional mentalist myself, I can tell you that not only is the material in this book poor, but Kreskin trying to pass himself off as the ""genuine article"" is hilarious. Not only is Kreskin himself a fake, but he is so outdated in his performing, that I have to watch him with one eye shut. I saw Kreskin on Regis and Kathy Lee performing a routine out of his new and he screwed it up. Then he did a ""real"" ESP effect and screwed that up as well. Regis just rolled his eyes along with 5 million viewers. My friend Pablo from Florida even caught on to how Kreskin did his ""genuine"" effect, and he's a plumber. I think it's finally time to give up Kreskin. It's not all bad though, I hear they are hiring greeters at Wal-Mart."
5,Beautiful vocals,"This CD is an hour of beautiful music, with Ama's amazing strong vocals. I loved it the first time I heard it and had to buy it. Do the same, you won't be sorry. It's great whether you like pop, folk, or soul."
4,Attractive,"I do not know what it is, but I just love this book. It has small paper size and I could carry it with my all around. It has a very deep understanding of the principles without confusing you with 100 acronyms in one sentence and it was the only book, which really explained to me what the erythrocyte sedimentation rate really meant.Well, I read this book a long time ago and I still look it up every now and then. If you like authentic things (not all these overcoloured texts), then you will love this book."
2,Very bad quality binding,"The content of the book is great for the most part. I have some issues with a few of the questions, but overall a great applicable text.The quality of the book is another story. Upon opening the text, the pages started to separate from the binding. I foresee them falling out in the near future. I paid well over $100 for this book, I expect it to be well made. Not something I could concoct with a piece of wood and craft glue."
4,more Amelia Peabody,"I have become hooked on this series of books about an intrepid Victorian amateur Egyptologist and her husband and son. I am particularly interested in the author's slants on feminism, racial equality, socioeconomic status and sexuality as well as the fascinating information on Egyptian archaeology."
5,"Ah, what to say about Spud and his Angel?","My sister knew the people who made this album. She used to listen to them practicing in their garage. She gave me the CD one day and told me to listen to it. It blew me away. And this was way before my eternal search for brilliant culture to feed on. This was really the start, though. It inspired me to try and find something like it. But of course NOTHING is like Sputnik and the Angel.#9 is one of my favorite songs. I just imagine rebirth through moonlight and being sent back down gently.Anyway, GET THIS!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I received this book as a gift. I usually don't read novels, preferring history, and nonfiction. So it took me awhile to get started on this book. Once I started, I was pleasantly surprised and quickly got pulled into the story. Unknowingly to me, I was reading a history book. This book really takes you back and made me feel like I was living in the forties and fifties. It's really well done and keeps you focused from start to finish."
1,Not for little kids,"This low rating is based on my perspective as a buyer for a 5 year old little boy.This book covers many aspects of Pokemon, including the cartoon. In a section where they are telling about episodes that were not televised in the U.S. they show a picture of big breasted females. As a reader of this book, you can't overlook this picture because the female with the biggest breast is holding her big breast. On another picture in the book there is a lady with breast so big that her face looks like it is off in the distance. The closeup is on her breast.[...] This book is not the best choice for young Pokemon fans."
5,CCG Player's Love This Book,"I always like these Pojo books on all of the collectable card games that are there now. It really helps to keep up with what's been going on and they're also fun to read. They pay good attention to all the cooliest graphics that make the games and anime really fun to be involved with. The deck advice is really valuable if you like to play or get into tournaments and stuff. The Total Pokemon book, like their other books, is really really comprehensive and I use it as a gaming resource book all the time. The best part is that they're great for gamers at ANY level, newbie and experienced."
5,greato,Order this thanks to the previous reviews. Spent a little more and was very pleases with product. Works great. Package came as expected.
4,Headset,"Headset has worked good so far, does not come with anything to stop you from breathing into the mic, otherwise it's worth the money."
5,Way better than the one that comes with the xbox!!,This works great! Glad a bought this to go with call of duty 4 :).
4,"Works Properly, Just Ugly","As a cheap headset, it works perfectly. I just don't really like the aesthetics of it. It is comfortable though."
3,Its very uncomfortable,It works well sounds good mic works well. But its really hard to not notice its on your head. Maybe i have an shaped head. But it is also oddly shaped.
2,Don't.,"I could hear through it just fine, but I had to shout to be heard, even though I put the mic as close to my mouth as I could move it."
2,Headset volume for listeners is too low,"I got this & had friends complain that though it was clear, the volume was way too low to hear. I returned it & got another one & been told it has the same issue."
5,Works great - great value,"bought this to replace the seldom functioning Microsoft headset that came with the xbox - this one works great and the price makes it even better. I purchased two of these, since the price is so reasonable. 6 months later, they are is still going strong, even one that my son tripped and stepped all over still works great after a little bit of duct tape to hold it back together. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this again, and I'm sure I will since my son leaves them laying on the floor all the time."
1,A complete waste of money,"This item worked perfectly for about 8 hours, then it died. The headset has a loose wire in it somewhere and connects intermittently. It was gently used by me only, no rough housing, no use by children, not dropped or otherwise misused.I found an old Uniden headset without a volume or mute control and it works perfectly as an Xbox 360 headset. I strongly suggest you not buy this item."
4,Good basic headset,After having and MS headset go out I went with this one. It seems to be sturdier than the MS versions. There are no frills though. It is just a basic headset. The mic might even be a little less sensitive than the MS headset. This is fine if you're playing a a loud room. But if you're playing at night and don't want to wake the family it doesn't seem to pick up quieter voices.Overall I gave it 4 stars and would easily recommend it. It is just a basic headset though. So don't expect anything different.
4,Nice quality headset - better than Microsoft's.,"After breaking 2 of the 1st Party Microsoft headsets, and [for awhile] thinking i could actually get away with not using a headset on live [oh how i was wrong] I decided to pick up this plantronics headset. The difference is amazing - first, it's cheaper, which is always good in this economy. Secondly, the headset feels like it's built better, and thirdly, the headset matches my black controller that i got with the 360 elite.There is only one minor downside. The controls for mic muting and volume control on the headset are a bit different - i think i liked the one on the MS headset better, but hey, i can get used to it.Great fit, great headset, only extremely minor gripes about it - how can you go wrong?Sure, it's not a turtle beach headset - who cares? i use this for voicechat, not 5.1 surround sound."
2,"Good build quality, poor mic performance.","Maybe the unit I received is defective, but I have to shout for the mic to pick my voice up. The headset is comfortable and fairly good looking, but the terrible mic makes it a failure. It's cheap for a reason, look elsewhere."
5,Great Xbox360 headsets for the price!!,"The is the 2nd pair I purchased. This one was a gift for a brother of mines because his regular xbox360 headset broke! But I love these headsets because its very comfortable on my head and they are more studier than the original xbox360 headset that come with the system. Plus, the sound quality is pretty good and friends that I play with online hear me very clear as if I was talking to them on a phone. They still think that I'm using one of those expensive headsets that cost alot but when I let them know how much I paid for these, some of them decided to buy one of their own and haven't been disappointed by the price and quality of these headsets online. Excellent job on these plantronics, your products hardly ever fail!"
3,flemsy,"This headset was okay. It did not last as long as I think it should of last. My 12 year old son got 8 months of use out of it, and it quit working, It was cheap though."
1,"works, but for how long?","purchased this headset 2.5 months ago. Worked like a charm with no issues (except for the mic pretty much has to be in your mouth to work, but not biggie.) Then in the middle of a session the mic quit working completely. Not sure what happened. The quality feels cheap and for the price you pay what do you expect. The sound works fine, but the mic is dead. The mic got light use (couple hours a week) as and was well taken care of.I will not buy another since this one bit the dust so soon. You get what you pay for, it's cheap!"
4,Much better than the Microsoft headset,"My Microsoft headset microphone stopped working after 7 months and my identical spare did not work out of the box (Microsoft did replace one with one that did work), so I swore off all Microsoft 360 headsets and went with the Plantronics X10 for Xbox 360. At first, it was a little snug but soon I got used to it. Works like a charm and all of my friends can now hear me loud and clear. I really like the volume/mute switch being inline because I can clip it to where I need it. At $14.99, this head set was cheaper than the Microsoft version. Hopefully, the Plantronics headset will last longer than the Microsoft set. I gave this headset 4 stars due to it's tighter than expected fit. All in all a better choice....so far."
1,Broke within a week,My son used it for less than a week. The ear piece broke off. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
4,Gamecom X10,"Not a bad headset for the money. Sometimes you have to talk pretty loudly to have others hear you, sometimes it works perfectly. Worth the price though."
5,Replaced original headset,"This product was cheap and works just as well as the one that comes with the xbox. No bells and whistles, just a standard headset. Awesome for the price"
3,Packed with Facts,I had to read this for an MA Archaeology class it is almost bogged down with facts but great if you want to learn the entire history of the development of archaeology.
3,"The ""Hollow Man"" Has Had a Solid Career.","This book is a companion piece to the ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game. I've played the game a few times, but I never actually knew there was a real 'board game' game of the game until recently. I figured that the book might help me learn a bit more about that wonderful actor, Kevin Bacon, and give me an edge over my croonies in crime the next time we play the game. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot here. The book is quite short and basically consists of a bunch of ""six degrees or less"" lists. The introduction by Kevin Bacon himself is interesting to read and so is the history of the game. The book also has a Kevin Bacon filmography that is rather informative. However, the book needs an update because Bacon's been in several films since 1997. This book is great for any fan of Bacon, any serious film buff, and anyone who likes to play the game. If you don't fall into one of those categories, don't waste your money."
1,Only for the Novice,"""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" can satisfy almost no one who knows the rules of the game. I'm deeply puzzled, in fact, why the book was written. Those who know the rules will gain nothing from it. The book does contain many lists that show how one can get from X to Kevin Bacon, but this information is found far more quickly on the web. Some of the lists in the book are not the most efficient, to add to the problem. Would-be-readers hoping to find a 7-degree or 8-degree Bacon number will not find one here, the only reason I can understand for purchasing a book on this subject. Perhaps it is a book that has outlived its time."
3,Pretty cool but contains at least one inaccuracy,"This game can be fun for people really into movies and the ""creators"" of the game have given us a pretty good companion book for people to check themselves. However, I found one very glaring mistake in the book. In the section about the Baldwins they claim that you can link Billy Baldwin to Kevin Pollak in The Usual Suspects and then to Kevin Bacon in A Few Good Men. Unfortunately, Billy Baldwin wasn't in The Usual Suspects. His brother Stephen was in The Usual Suspects. I'm a little surprised that no one has written about this in a review yet. For a couple of guys you claim to know a lot about Kevin Bacon, they sure screwed that one up. Other than that, this book is fun."
3,"Solti's Beethoven is too careful, but the CSO plays wonderfully","I'm surprised by the scorching reviews for this CD. In both the Beethoven Fourth and Fifth the Chicago Sym. plays beautifully and Decca's recording is clear and forward. Solti gives us traditional readings that are too cautious--strange from such a fiery conductor--but never less than respectable. In both works the tempos are moderate to slow. Solti labors too hard to shape the Andante con moto of the Fifth, which lacks natural charm in his hands--the line sags after the first eight bars. He could be much more abandoned in the finales of both works--listen to Karajan and Kleiber for how to cut loose here. Othrewise, given that Gunter Wand earns raves at Amazon for equally traditional and unimaginative Beethoven, there's no reason not to give Solti his due."
5,A must-have for Broadcast fans,"Being one who was utterly enchanted by their first US release, the compilation ""Work and Non-Work"", I was eager for anything else by this Birmingham (?) based group. Their latest offering, ""The Noise Made By People"" ups the ante with a more cohesive feel and sound. This CD-single contains one song from ""Noise"" (Papercuts) plus some great material available only on this release. Two are instrumentals: ""Belly Dance"" is dark and slightly silly (a terrific combo!); ""Dave's Dream"" bleeps and burps while the Siren calls. They're wonderful, but the real standout is ""Where Youth and Laughter Go"", with its jumps from the intimately-sung verses to the wordless, cavernous chorus. A song full of emptiness.I'm so glad I didn't pass it up, even though it costs a bit here in the States!"
3,good price... ok fit....,"Overall this is a decent aftermarket product for the money. However, the alignment to the body cavity isn't quite perfect and the harness boot did not fit the hole in the body at all. I ended up cutting the boot off of the old wire harness and reused it to get the proper seal.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4KA5C/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,Three words: Yu. Gi. Rocks.,"yu gi will never disappoint. whether playing his trusty dark magician or busting out the legendary slifer the sky dragon, one thing's for sure. yu gi is no fooolio!!my names mike and i'm 19 and 3/4 years old"
2,"Great for a few doors, but it wears out VERY quickly.","For some reason, when I'm trying to renovate an old house, all of the door knob holes are too small! For whatever reasons, the newer knobs require larger holes.... I've been remodeling ""mid century"" houses lately.Pros: It's cheap. Gets the job done. If you're drilling a couple of doors for your house, buy this one and then be prepared to just throw it away.- When you're using this, stop when you're halfway through the door and clean out the sawdust. Otherwise it'll stay clogged and just spin. If it stops going in, take a screwdriver and break out sections of the wooden plug.Cons: Dulled very easily. After about twenty doors, it has dulled, and doesn't work as well. It's slow and jumps around."
5,A Frighteningly Good Book,"I read this book when I was almost in high school, far too old for Francine Pascal according to the popular opinion at my school. Even so, I devoured it at home, loving every word. This book was spooky and chilling while beautifully written. The ending could use some work, for it left too much unexplained, but really there's no room for critiscism."
5,Haribo gummi bears,"The best gummi bear around, got hooked on these when I was a kid. At the time only got them at Marshall Field store in Chicago. As for price about the same as you can buy them at Walmart or Walgreens. They sell them in 5.0-5.5 oz bags for 94 cents ea.So three bags about a pound. (16 oz)"
2,the taste was not as good as I expected,"The bag I got seemed to be mostly lemon and lime gummy bears. The flavor was not as good as I had expected. Should be fine for kids, my grandkids like them OK but as an adult I was disappointed. But even the kids said they were just OK. I decided not to order them again."
3,Good but extremely stale,This 5lb bag will probably last 6 months because of how stale the gummies are. They still taste great but they are nearly impossible to chew. I portion out the serving size and then suck on them which I guess is a plus if you're dieting.
2,Meh,"I was looking for some gummi bears in bulk and thought I'd try these after seeing them get good reviews and was rather disappointed in them. They were soft, but seemed to be rather tasteless.I also noticed on the package list they contained Carnauba Wax. Even it's safe to eat, I find it really hard to eat something knowing it has the same ingredient used in car wax."
5,best gummibears ever,not to sweet not stickydont travel anywhere without themjuicy natural taste and the colors are all naturalhigh qualityTOP QUALITY FOR LITTLE MONEY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
4,Almost as good as the small bags you get at the store,"Another reviewer stated these are second only to the black forest ones, and while I like the black forest ones, I think the Haribo ones stand up to it. But I'm used to the Haribo and black forest ones in the smaller bags you pick up at the brick and mortar, and these seem to be slightly harder than those. But considering the price at the local stores for the smaller bags, the difference is well worth the savings.It's amazing how many fit into a 5 pound bag, too...Delicious and cheap, a wonderful combination."
5,Only buy Haribo!,"These are from Europe, and they are the best. Haribo are kinda tough to eat, but that's what makes them good. They are so much better than the kind you buy at Circle K. Buy in the 5 pound bag, and you will save money as opposed to buying from the Sweet Factory at the mall."
2,Gummi bears,"Haribo Gummi Candy Gold-Bears, 5-Pound BagNot as fresh as store bought. Very chewy and hard to chew."
5,DELICIOUS!,"I bought this bag of gummies for my boyfriend because it's his favorite candy. They were VERY fresh and extremely favorful! I didn't want them to get stale, so I sealed the bag after each time we dug into it. I also kept them in the fridge. The last one tasted just as good as the first one. Definitely a great buy!!!"
4,not large enough,"We all know that gummi bears are awesome. This bag, while it seems massive to begin with, once you start, this stuff goes really quickly."
1,Failed,"On a regulate day, I LOVE this brand of gummy bear. My new husband and I ordered it for our wedding party favor. However, by the time it's delivered it was allllll melted... I didn't know it's possible until a few weeks ago......"
1,not the originals,"these are not the originals they are produced in Hungary and not Germany and taste differently. There are not bad at all, but they are not the same as the originals from Germany despite the fact they are produced in a Haribo factory."
1,Horrible TASTE,This taste old and dry It is not like the fresh ones you get usually soft and some juice in it. Beware you might want a refund on this
1,Haribo not vegetarian,"Haribo gummies came up under a search for ""vegetarian."" They have gelatin in them, and so they are not vegetarian."
2,Would not buy again.,"I purchased this item in pink back in April, by May the hard drive crashed... I sent it back to the company for repair and I have been waiting a month for it to be returned. I love the unit itself but the customer service is the most horrible that I have ever received.I will not purchase another product from this company."
1,Horribly complicated to set,"This watch is beautiful. I have a PhD (big deal), so I thought I could set it. Wrong! All I really need is to know what time it is in my zone, not what time it is in Zanzibar. I could not even get it set for that! The instruction book was not helpful; as most instuction books are it was badly written. It did not define unfamiliar terms. I ended up sending it back, so I still don't know what time it is. Maybe I never will."
5,Simply the best,"This is the man that defined my, and many others' childhoods. The man that infused us with confidence in ourselves, and the strength to stand up and say and do things that weren't always popular (indicative of the fact that he wore PINK!!). The man was fearless in and out of the ring. It didn't matter who he was in the ring with he made them shine, and you always knew where you stood with the Hitman.He has since had his world turned upside down, from the premature death of his brother Owen, to his battle with post concussion syndrome and subseuqent stroke, and the death of his legendary parents, Bret has continued to conduct himself like a champion. Proving to the world once more, that he is the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be!"
2,Boring Self Important Ass,"Apparently if you're from Canada this will be the best thing ever shown on your television - or at least that's what Bret Heart would claim since according to him he is a GOD in Canada.Overall this video is just boring compared to other recent WWE videos I've seen. Because Bret Hart is such a self important ass the bite has completely been taken out of this making of this video since they had to have his permission on everything, watch the Ultimate Warrior video for example of what I'm talking about. While something like the '97 Survivor Series is covered, it only really gives Bret's side of the story while McMahon has very little to say - in other words it's just the same thing you've already heard a million times.The matches on the video are decent and if you're a big Bret Hart fan you're going to buy it just for that, but if you're not I'd spend my money on something else like the much more interesting Jake the Snake Roberts video."
4,Great read,"This book kept me up for hours at night. the story is interesting from page 1. this story is about the adventures of an orphaned boy named Taro , whose family was killed by the enemies of his father, who was a samurai. Taro is adopted by an army general, Lord Akiyama. the story is about his life as a servant and then his becoming a samurai and his adventures in battle and his friendships and losses.this is a must read."
3,The Samurai's Tale,"I think this was a ok book. For a 12-year old, we had to read it in class. It was sort of hard to understand, but still made sense. At first it was boring but got better during the end. It is about a boy named Taro. He is a samurai's son, until his dad gets killed by the lord's soldiers. They spare Taro's life, and let him live and work in the castle. He goes from different ranks, until he finally becomes a samurai just like his dad."
5,This toy is awsome!,I bought this toy to have fun and thats what i got it has so many different things that you can build with it too. I have many oreint expidetion sets but this one is my favorite!!!
1,Definitely NOT one of Neal's best...,"Neal's post-Journey work has been very impressive; however, the blues doesn't seem to be his forte. The singer chosen to head up this version of a ""band"" creates a feeling similar to fingers on a chalkboard. Can't really say what Neal was thinking when he chose him. Neal is, and has been, one of the finest guitarists out there. Although he did manage to pull off a few good solo riffs on this album, it is mostly disappointing. For good quality guitar playing, you would be better served with ""Beyond the Thunder"" or ""Electric World"". Those two are classic Neal Schon at his best."
1,This stupid thing gave me a headache!,I bought the video player watch hoping that I would look as cool as my all time favorite hero Dick Tracy. When I recieved my watch in the male I couldn't open the package fast enough. When I finally got it out and uploaded my movie into it I began to watch but the screen was so small I couldn't see anything on it. I squinted really hard and brought the screen up to my face so I could make out the episode of South Park and watched it until it ran out of batteries 25 minutes later. As soon as I lowered the watch from my face my eyes began to hurt very badly and nothing was coming into focus. After a trip to the eye doctor I now know to wear reading glasses when I watch shows on this battery guzzling monstrocity.
1,Missing parts,I have now ordered the pond heater and the deicer guard so I would have this s*** while I am gone for 10 days and I still don't have the required spring to assemble this crap. I am now going to have to make my own attachment. Don't order this junk.
4,"Light, Slim, Reliable",This stand works exactly as described. I have a slip case on my iPad 2 as well as the Leather Apple screen cover. This item holds the iPad securely in any orientation. Also the bottom legs hold the iPad high enough that you can charge it while it is sitting on the stand.
5,Awesome Stand for your Tablet,"This stand is really terrific. It is small, lightweight, and it doesn't require me to add a silly over-sized case to my tablet. It fits my Motorola Xoom (with thin gel case) perfectly. The stand is sturdy, and very adjustable. The Xoom fits in it both horizontally and vertically.The only problem is that you cannot really plug into the bottom ports while you are using the stand. Not a huge deal, as you can easily remedy this by flipping the tablet upside down. Most tablets should work fine like this, and you can use your ports normally.Five star product, and I am looking forward to purchasing other Arkon products in the future."
3,It works.,"I was skeptical at first when using it. The plastic notches just seem like they'll eventually wear out. I still worry about that but I guess if they do I'll buy another. After scouring the internet for a stand for a decent price, I settled on this one. And then my wife started using it all the time with hers, she sets it in and types, plays Sudoku, etc. So i started searching again and ended up on this one again. So now I have two of them. They don't blow me away, but are very portable, hold the iPad in very well, and are low cost. I don't think there is a better one, at least not for the price point.Edit - 4/6/12A year later and it's still fine. I don't love it, but it is definitely durable. No issues with the plastic notches or wear and tear."
5,"Super sturdy & light, no slipping","Amazingly sturdy with such light plastic and simple design (Don't worry, your Xoom is VERY SAFE on top). The velvety stuff grips the Xoom very nicely. No slipping around at all. The stand holds the Xoom half an inch above desk, which is pretty good for gaming purposes. It is very portable, but I'm happy with just using it on my desk. So easy to use too."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"This stand is perfect for holding up my Motorola Xoom, even with the silicon gel case around it. It adjusts perfectly to many different angles, from 90 down to 30. I used to use a pillow to prop up my Xoom, and it would slip down a lot of the times. Now I use this, and I can play all my snes games, as well as watch videos (can't wait for netflix to hit the Xoom market). The ports are still accessible, and it fits perfectly when folded up into my case logic carrying case, without having to sit on top of the screen, or behind it. I couldn't have asked for anything better."
5,Very nice portable stand,"I purchased this stand after reading the reviews. I love this stand. It's compact, light, and exactly what I was looking for. It holds the iPad very securely at pretty much any angle you want. Most of what I can say about this stand only echoes what others have already said, but the product was too good to not do a review. I wanted something portable and lightweight and this product fits the bill. I will recommend this stand to anyone looking for one."
5,Great Versatile Stand For My iPad 2,"Was looking for a veratile stand for my iPad2 capable of multiple angles in both landscape and portrait positions...with an Apple Smart Cover attached; sturdy enough to be able to type on without knocking the device over; lightweight and portable enough that I can carry it in my netbook-sized bag, along with my iPad; and, most importantly, inexpensive.I came across the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand. Read the reviews in Amazon and thought this was the stand for me. Ordered the stand and received it within 4 business days. Love it...everything I was looking for.The only thing negative I would mention is that it's a bit difficult to charge the iPad 2 when in portrait mode.....but, quite frankly, that's a non-issue for me as I usually have the device in landscape and, well, with the battery life of this thing, I don't often charge it.Since purchasing the stand, I've convinced two of my friends to buy one from Amazon. I highly recommend the Arkon Portable Fold-Up Stand."
5,Handy item for IPad,"I ordered this item to use with my new IPad. It makes using the IPad so much easier when doing facetime, playing games, looking things up, etc. I place the IPad on this stand when cooking with recipes I'm making and it's so handy!"
4,Cheap and works fine,"I use this with a Nook Color. After setting it up properly, it works fine in both portrait and landscape. However, there's not enough room on the bottom of the stand to charge the Nook Color when in portrait.I do not use this for travel. It sits on my desk and I usually put the Nook Color on it in landscape so I can easily charge it.A great product, but the soft material attached to the plastic stand to keep your gadgets from scratching is pealing off. I've had this stand for a little over a year.I would recommend getting this if you need a cheap stand for your tablet. In theory, it should work with most, if not all, tablets on the market. But I would be weary of the charging situation. You probably cannot charge your device while in portrait mode if the charger is on the bottom of your device."
5,Great product for the price,I've sampled a few different products and this one is definitely my favorite one based on it's price and versatility.
4,Good for the price,"This is a nice, inexpensive little stand that I use with my iPad 2. I wish the slots on the bottom were made a little differently as the iPad doesn't always seem steady in it. However, I have mostly used it with a silicone sleeve on the iPad and that could be the issue. Otherwise it is well made and a great buy."
3,Its Ok,"Its a very handy stand, but I find it too light, and as such it is unable to hold my ASUS Transformer at certain angles. Also when you press on the screen, it does not feel the stand is rigid, and the tablet will ""swing"", at certain angles.In most positions it works as promised.Overall, I am satisfied with the product and plan to use it, just not as much as I thought I would be able it.It is however the only choice for someone like me, who does not want leather casing for thier tablets."
3,"CAVEAT EMPTOR - BETTER THAN OTHERS - FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 2 7""","For a simple stand this is not to bad. I use it with my Galaxy Tab 2 7"". Adjusting it for your device takes some getting used to but don't hurl it against the wall. Take your time.This may seem like a lot of money to pay for a few simple pieces of plastic. That's because it is.Relatively speaking this is better than the two other I have tried. Both were manufactured by Samsung. The only one I have not tried is the:USB Docking Cradle for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0$28.99.This will probably work but I'm not in the mood to spend the $29.00.PAY ATTENTION TO SMALL PRINT AND ASK. If it does not say the Docking Cradle is for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 7"" don't go near it. Even so, the last one I tried was supposed to work but the base of the tab was too thick for the dock.One of these is simply a stand and has do docking capabilities. Actually that is all I was looking for."
5,Does the job,"It def works and does the job. Many different adjustments, ready to use out the box. But make sure it is on a stable surface, or it can fall easy."
5,Works Great for Nexus 10!,"Using this for a Nexus 10, and it works great! Lots of little adjustments, so I'd imagine this would work fine for a number of tablets. Would absolutely recommend."
5,Holds iPad 2 with gumdrop case,It holds my iPad 2 with the gumdrop case perfectly. Very sturdy and compact. By far the best stand i bought.
5,What a bargain,This is the perfect stand for the iPad and such a great buy. Plus you don't have to take your iPad out of its case to use the stand.
5,"Wow, it really works!",Most iPad stands begin around $49 and allow you one or two positions at most. The Arkon fold-up stand is dirt cheap and allows a seemingly infinite number of positions. And it works in both landscape and portrait. It's really portable and will meet almost any need you'll have for an iPad stand.
4,WOnderful,I put my ipad on it and watch movie on my bad .how nice .I love it very much .if you are bed ipad playier you should have one
2,MEH at best,"This may be decent to use on a flat surface where you have no chance of bumping into your device. I had gotten it to use as a stand for while in bed and I think it only alright.My biggest gripe is that it does not seem like they actually had an ipad when they designed this.It is highly adjustable, but the angles where you actually get good contact on the back arm is very limited. At 45 degrees it is ROCK SOLID. The back makes full contact. At a higher angle though, just the tip of the back pad touches the surface.So if you need to hold your ipad at 45 degrees this is a great device. At a higher or lower angle the back pad barely touches and the unit is a bit unstable."
3,Functional,It works fine - holds up the Sony Xperia tablet with no problem. I think the $14 price tag is a bit steep though.
5,Love it!,"I ordered this because I wanted a simple stand to hold my ipad while following recipes. I actually love it and use it all the time on my nightstand, while I'm traveling, etc. It's simple and adjustable and I don't have to take the cover off my ipad to fit. If you're just looking for a simple stand this is the one to get. It does hold your tablet in a vertical as well as horizontal position. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is a little challenging charging the tablet when in a vertical position. This is not a big deal for me."
1,Great while it lasts..which is 10 days.,"I was very Excited to get my hands on what seems to be a very versatile product. I really enjoyed it until i started to spread the legs and one of them cracked off.Pros: Great Idea, Many adjustable options for viewingCons: Cheaply made, Rubber/stickers on the bottom to hold the unit in place seemed like they wouldn't stay on for too long.I am returning the product & continuing the search for a good ipad holder. I suggest you keep looking as well."
2,Misleadingly titled,"The book's subtitle is ""A Czech History,"" but people looking for a general history of the Czech lands will be disappointed. Sayer focuses not on battlefields and parliaments but on art, literature and historiography. He either completely ignores or barely mentions such topics as the world wars, the Munich Pact and the Communist coup while devoting dozens of pages to poets, artists and critics. Thus, despite the rather esoteric nature of Czech history, Sayer assumes readers already know the basics. I guess a title like ""The Humanities and Czech Identity, 1620-1960"" wouldn't sell as well."
4,Civil War on Sunday,"Do you want to read a book that is fun and adventurous?Civil War on Sunday by Mary Pope Osborne is the book for you.First, this book can take you back in history to the Civil War.I learned about a famous nurse, Clara Bartow. She risked her life for soldiers on the battlefield. She cared for soldiers from the Confederate Army and the Union Army. The wounded were laid in wagons and taken to camp where they would recognized there relatives from the Union Army.Have you ever thought of yourself rather than others? In this book Jack and Annie face this lesson. I was reminded to think of others more than myself. Will Jack and Annie help the soldiers rather then getting out of danger? Do you think they will get home safely?This book is about history and gives good lessons. I suggest you read this book to learn more about history.By: Dayna Beatty 4th Grader."
5,Fun Book,"I really enjoyed going through this book. There is a good amount of licks from different styles and the integration of the licks into the tracks on the CD are really good. There is a nice variety of songs and some basic scale and music theory. The only thing that I don't really like is that the lead for the songs are placed on only one track of the CD. This makes it kind of annoying to keep going back and forth. IMO he should have split it up into sections but it's not that big of a deal. This stuff may be too advanced for beginners. If you are just the casual lead guitarist, maybe 2-3 years experience would be sufficient to play this stuff. Beginners should buy Texas Blues by Calva, it is much easier than this stuff. Overall good book and worth going through."
5,The Greatest of all Assyrian albums !!,"This is the best by far,I love every songs my Kinds got into assyrian music because of this CD.WALTER thank you !!"
1,NOT FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS!!,"Two seconds in and even -I- was lost. She at no point explains what any movement is. She just does it and expects you to follow it perfectly. There is no ""Step 1: Raise your arms slowly and step back. Step 2: cross hands over your heart... etc."" She just does it at full speed right off the bat.If you are an absolute beginner, do -NOT- get this. Go with Belly Dance for Beginners. She actually tells you what you're doing and, *GASP!* how to do it."
3,fun and a good exercise,"ive been using this for about a month and i have dropped ten pounds, it gives you a good workout and the new moves add some spice in the bedroom."
4,Nice Buy,"Bought as a gift for friends and I see them using these regularly when I am over, they seem to be holding up to wear."
5,"Absolutely one of the best new bands I've heard, great CD !",I've seen these guys live several times they are totally worth listening to. I highly reccomend their CD. Hard not to get up and move to. Awesome sounds !
1,DVD sucks!! SELENA ROCKS!,IT just sucks! no what was promised! Very upset. Seeing Selena perform made me well. Capitol records shame on U!!
2,Where Cam go?,"This is a typical graduate stage album for the high profile rapper....I guess after all the videos concerts trips around the world and gettin Oreily himself flustered, my man Cam turned into a one of those with so much food on his plate he can no longer relate. This is not like my man either. Can someone tell me wheres the real Camron Giles!? We waitin doggie....."
3,OK depending on the price,"I paid six dollars for this on amazon over the summer - it's probably worth about that much. My 4 year old (the recipient) lost interest in it quickly, while my 17 month old plays with it occasionally. Amazon is now selling it for $30 - definitely not worth that much!"
3,a major let down for tetris fans,"I have always been a fan of tetris I was lucky enough to get teh Tengen 2 player Version on the old NES before it was pulled in favor to the NES standard version. but my nes isn't that reliable after 16 years so i wasreally excited when I saw this set in the box. Most of the plug and plays are pretty good and the images looked like the original game I loved. here is the downside - joystick block is difficult to maneuver the pieces and is way too touchy, also this version lacks a standard simultaneous play mode only battle ( where your mulitple line sets are added to your opponents stack) or timed where you need to be the first one to complete a set # of lines. I wish I hadn't bought it. So I'll keep trying."
2,Too much dust in Minnie's throat,"The drawback to this CD/recording is Tebaldi. Her voicesounds dry, one-dimensional, wobbly, out of tune and forced.Though I liked the orchestra's performance I had to put thisCD in the ""give-away"" bin simply because listening to Tebaldi was so uncomfortable."
1,Do NOT buy!,"I was so excited to see such cheap batteries...well, you get what you pay for. I put 4 of these into my digital camera and about 2 pictures later, got the low battery icon.Tried 4 others, same thing.Returned these immediately. Amazon is great with accepting returns, but don't bother buying these. They are useless."
1,Waste of Money,Cheap batteries. They have a short short live. I put these in my mouse and they lasted less than a month. Even cheap store brand batteries last at least 2 months. This item gets a rip-off award from me. I'll never buy these again. I gave it one star because that is the minimum.
1,Not for the general reader.,"After reading a third of the book, I finally gave up out of sheer disinterest. The way the book is presented would probably be ideal for a student of network dynamics, or even a mathmetician. For an average reader like myself, it is far too detailed and laborious. There is very little entertainment value in the discussions that surround the occasional revelations. My suggestion: Read the abbridged version."
3,Too much information for the common reader,"The book ""Linked"" is very interesting and it is written so that the average person can follow it. However, the author describes every detail (it seems) of how he and his colleagues discovered the links, hubs, etc., and how they disproved past theories, etc. For some people, that's probably interesting, and even good for people who want to do real research and use this book as a reference. However, for someone who is just curious, there are too many mathmatical formulas and scientific references. I found myself thinking, ""Get to the point already."" Not recommended for the average joe reading out of curiosity. Too much information that the common reader will not care about, but a lot of information for scientists, mathmeticians, researchers, etc. Overall, though, a good read."
1,All that glitters is not gold!,"I was very excited about this book before I started reading it. By the first few pages I realized I wasn't going to get the detailed insight I was looking for. The author is not technical at all in the book, although his credentials lead one to believe that he will go into some detail. He boasts a lot which I thought was really uncalled for. The research stories are interesting but he doesn't give more. Novice level, for sure."
4,Networks everywhere - We are one,"This book's author explores networks that exist in everything from Hollywood actors to cellular proteins and lets us into the private (and unexpectedly exciting and humorous) world of mathematicians and physics professors. The 80/20 rule is described as it applies to monetary success by people, web site success with Internet traffic, frequency of protein use in cellular reactions, and evolutionary success of DNA mutations. Be forewarned, the chapter on network economy will not be calming at this time of recession unprecedented since the 1930's. The book drags a little at times. What I was most surprised to find is that I came away with feeling of being one with the universe; inexorably linked, networked, both a product of and an influencer of this world. Dude, Ooohhhhmmmm..... Ooohhhhmmmm..... Ooohhhhmmmm....."
5,Quite good approach to understand networks.,"Before reading this book, I didn't know that Networks theories are with us since serveral decades. I'm almost finishing it, but I couldn't wait to write something about the book; specially to recommend you to buy it!Barabasi work is really great. His redaction skills are as good that people without mathematics or science knowledge can understand and deeply learn Networks theory."
4,Fascinating Linkage,"Excellent read. I'm a systems engineer by trade and although the book is by no means technical, it really drove the ""connectedness"" topic home for me as the author showed how objects naturally connect and grow in both real and abstract terms. If this sounds interesting- you will enjoy it too."
4,a great intro to modern network research,"barabasi does a great job of bringing you up to speed on current networking stuff, really focusing on the great strides that have been made in the past decade or two from all sorts of fields. my only complaints about the book were that it's not technical enough, doesn't have enough technical pointers (citeseer is your friend), and really stops at ""hey, everything follows a power law!"" but that's appearantly barabasi's schtick, power laws and scale free networks, i'll have to look elsewhere for what the implications for that finding really are.overall, a good introduction for the curious mind, but not nearly technical enough."
2,Great until 6months after i bought it.,"Features are EXCELLENT!.. However customer service DOES NOT EXIST!!.. The display went out on my 6 months after i bought.. sent it off to denon.. Took 6 months to get it back.. I called multiple times and could not get an answer.. Went onto the website and filled out the ""customer service card"" and still no service.. I finally got a body and they said ""your unit is in service we will ship it out in a month"".. WTF.. It came the next day.. Interesting.. Bottom Line.. Customer Service for Denon does not exist. If you have any problems your SOL.. I sole mine on ebay.. DONT BUY IT!.. I paid $700.. And felt betrayed.. No more denon for me.. If you want a DVD Player get a apex ($80) bucks from walmart.. It'll play everything including burned CD/DVD.. This unit will not.."
2,"Interesting, but too deterministic!","The Tofflers have a valid point by stating that technology will play a vital role in the winning of wars. Indeed, cameras, computers and microchips today provide valuable input in the making of military strategy. However, one must remember that technology is useless when you don't have the men with the political willingness to undertake the risks associated with war. Doctrine, planning and human will are far more important factors in the business of waging war and defeating the enemy. Besides, for every technological breakthrough, there will always be flaws and weaknesses associated with such technology. A skillful adversary will always try to exploit those weaknesses for his own advantage. From this point of view, the Tofflers are too deterministic by putting their trust in technology as a determinant for victory or defeat."
2,"Interesting, but not good enough","Reading this book was rather like going into a 400 page Newsweek article. Even though the theory about ""waves"" can seem appealing, the authors fail to provide a theorical framework for the ideas they propose. Ok, so the wars of the future will be different.. so what?There's no explanation within the book that tries at least to determine what the causes of the future wars will be. It leaves the door open for any ""random"" cause to ignite a war.Anyway, I could say the anecdothic style of the book makes it easy to read, but if you're looking for a more in-depth text about wars and their future implications, forget about this one."
1,Not impressed,Nothing new. Doubt if it works. Don't like the way it's presented. Thought quite a waste of money.
5,I Just Lost 47 Pounds With This Book,"I started Jim's program from Flip The Switch back in May. Then, to take my program even further, I joined his web site www.jimkaras.com in July. Well, as of today, I am down 57 pounds and easily into a size 4. Me, Miss 16 on a good day, is now wearing a four.I totally believe in Jim and his plan. Do you know that he calls his web members every week? That is such motivation to stick with the plan and he is the best coach for your mind and body.Do yourself a huge favor. Start this program today."
5,WELL DONE,"Amazing first novel, very engaging and loaded with personality. Letts expertly manipulates the phenomenon of coincidence into a fantastic story.The horse content is spot-on; no one who hasn't mucked out a stall or galloped over the landscape on the back of a horse can write about equines like this. The horses sparkle right off the page right along with the people. And only a person who grew up around the rugged coastline of southern California can bring the Pacific, the Santa Ana winds, the wildflowers and the wildfires right into your head the way Elizabeth Letts has. Of course, being a nurse/midwife herself also helps with the accurate medical descriptions, and Letts makes the excitement and trauma of birth as real as it can be on the written page.The only thing I stubbed a toe on was a character that vacillates from downright mean to nurturing, and it seemed a stretch to call it tough love, but maybe that's just me. All in all a very enjoyable read."
1,CASIO A168W watch bought from Amazon,"The watch itself is as expected, the original CASIO product, no complains. However, I found the handsome wristband that comes with this watch when bought directly from CASIO (also as seen on the picture) is missing, and has been replaced with a much cheaper dull band. I've seen this watch bought directly from CASIO before, and now I think I understand why the same one on Amazon sells for less. Said that though, I still believe this is not being honest with the customer."
3,Love it but not well made,"I bought this fountain a couple of years ago. Within the first few months all of the clips holding the lights had broken. By the end of the first season the lights had corroded and no longer worked. The fountain still looks O.K., thanks to my patching the side when it got damaged from being blown over from the wind, repainting it each summer and storing it indoors seven months of the year. The lghts added a lot for me and I am disappointed that they lasted such a short time. I wrote to the manufacturer several times to see about buying a replacement light string but they never responded. So, it looks great from a distance in the daytime, but is not what I thought I was buying. I will grudgingly look for a replacement fountain."
2,Too heavy!!,"This dryer is average. It doesn't dry much better than other dryers. It weighs a TON. If you have long hair like I do, your arm will be ready to fall off after 10 minutes. If I try to dry my hair AND my daughter's in the same night it is nearly impossible. Do yourself a favor, and buy a lighter dryer!"
4,Great professional quality hair dryer.,"This is the first professional quality, more expensive hair dryer I've ever bought/used at home. It's very different than regular, cheaper ones you buy at the local drug store. It dried my hair much faster and the high heat resulted in a much more polished, smooth look. People sometimes think heat is bad for your hair, but in reality it's better to use a higher heat for a shorter period of time on your hair rather than a lower heat that takes longer.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it is quite heavy. But completely worth it."
1,Pulls back my hair,"Nice package, free miny oil buttle sample, nevertheless I feel is not what it offers, it pulls back my hair and it doesn't shine. About heating is not too good. I wouldn't recommend it"
1,BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer,"When my Vidal Sassoon dryer of 4 years needed to be replaced, I reviewed many -and ordered the Babyliss-- hate it! It is very heavy, awkward to use, not well balanced, overly expensive and does not get nearly as hot on hot as the Sassoon- and the placement of the cool button is terrible.Will be putting this in the Goodwill box. If you are a body builder- this may be ok- However, I think it is a piece of overrated junk!"
5,Awesome hair dryer!,This is a very nice dryer! It was very quick and powerful! Def. would recommend to a friend! Great buy :)
2,not good for straight/dry hair,"I was so excited when I recieved this hair dryer in the mail-I spent hours looking up reviews to find the perfect hair dryer, so I really wanted to like this one. Unfortunately, I tried this hair dryer 4 times, but just couldn't get myself to like it. I have naturally straight, medium thickness, color treated (dry) hair so I'm looking for shine/moisture and body in a hair dryer. This hair dryer gave me neither. In fact, I compared it to my old conair travel hair dryer (blew dry half my hair with the conair, half with the babyliss) and I found the babyliss side of my head to be much dryer with many more flyaways than the other side of my hair. The babyliss did nothing for my hair body either, and instead kind of gave it a weird square shape. All in all I would say that maybe this hairdryer works for people with curly or very thick hair, but if you do not have this hair type BE VERY WARY OF LISTENING TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE."
5,"Love, love, love this dryer!","I have had this dryer for many years and absolutely love it. I have thick, wavy hair that frizzes easily. This dryer straightens it like no other. After many years of service, the switch is going bad, so I'm here to buy my 2nd one. Love the power, super air force, heat, cool shot...everything about it. It isn't too heavy, or the nozzle isn't so long that I'm banging my head! Highly recommend it."
5,It's what you need!,"This hairdryer works so well, and it's not as loud as most do. Plus the purple color is so cute. Both I and my husband love it very much!"
2,I had such high hopes,"I'm being generous with my two stars. I have pretty thick, wavy, highlighted, long hair. This dryer just doesn't have the airflow needed to dry my hair without frying it. It does get hot (HEY! that's worth two stars, right?), but when not paired with powerful air flow, you're just baking your strands. I'm returning it. My drug store hair dryer works much better. I am SO disappointed."
3,good dryer but is broken after 1 1/2 years,I really like this dryer which I purchased in March of 2010. It has been taken care of and used everyday by only me. The price has gone up almost 10 bucks and now I need another one because it's not working. Is less than 2 years all we can expect from this? I would give it 5 stars as it's wonderful- but 1 star for durability.
1,Defective and Dangerous!,"I purchased this based on the good reviews it received. I used it twice, it worked great, cut my drying time in half. It is heavier than any other hair dryer I have had, but due to the decreased drying time...I decided to overlook the weight. Then, for the third time out of the drawer I was drying my 4 y/o daughters hair. Thank God I was drying the back of her head, because after about 30 seconds it made a very loud pop & shot out sparks that hit her in the back of the neck. It burned her, did not leave a large mark but again thank God we weren't drying the front of her hair -it might have hit her in the eyes instead!"
3,"Good at drying hair, but poor design","I own this hair dryer now for around 6 weeks. I have long thick straight hair, so need a hair dryer that will dry quickly (before I get bored).This hair dryer does a good job of drying my hair quickly. However, I find it quite heavy, and the button for the cold air is just where it is most comfortable for me to hold it, and so I often end up pressing this accidentaly. Also, the sliders to turn on and off/change heat settings are almost flush with the hairdryer, so if you have wet or slippy hands, it is not easy to move the sliders. I also find the power cord far too long for what I need (my outlet is right beside my mirror), and so it tends to just get tangled up in itself.I like this hair dryer because it does a good job of drying my hair. But I wouldn't buy it again, I'm sure there are other hair dryers that do just as good a job that aren't as inconvenient to hold/use."
1,parts are made wrong.,This would have been a fun model if the parts would have been made right.I CALLED MIDWEST PRODUCTS THEY ASKED FOR PICTURES OF THE BAD PART WITCH I ALREADY HAD PAINTED AND HAD PART OF IT PUT TOGETHER.THEY HAD DRILLED THE HOLES ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE MAINFRAME.THEN THEY WANTED IT SENT TO THEM.AFTER THEY GOT IT THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY WILL HAVE ANY NEW ONE DONE.
1,Unsatisfied,"I recieved my product timely after ordering. I was extremely unhappy with the product. The craftmenship was very poor. The wooden sections of the stand did not match in color. The globe itself would not remain in place on the stand. I would NOT recommend this product at all. However, the assistance I recieved in returning it and obtaining my refund was fantastic."
3,adequate for the job,"I wanted an inexpensive scaffold for the masonry work I'm doing at home and this one fit the bill. I've only used it occassionally so far, but will be using it more extensively as the walls go higher. It seems to be a decent product for the price."
1,Buffalo Tools and You,"I used to work the flea market circuit in the 80's and they were the most rot-gut tools you could buy. The packaging always had inflated pricing on it so you could sell it to your customers and make it look like they were getting a good deal. As I was selling them for a while, I took some home with me. Ratchets broke, sockets got striped, screwdrivers would bend and the tips would be ground down even when matched with the screw and not applying much torque. I vividly remember one screwdriver set had a retail price on it of $29.95 but cost me about 3 bucks."
4,goddess of desire delivers,"Before I bought the cd ""Symbol of Triumph"" I read the one and only review which basically said that the cd [was bad], but I went ahead with my purchase intentions and was pleasantly surprised. I actually searched for other releases by the band. If you like Celtic Frost, The Meatmen (newer), Mentors, Green Jelly (the heavier stuff)- than you should like Goddess of Desire. They are very heavy with a moderate, yet varied tempo, crunchy guitar with plenty of backbone. They are in somewhat of a 80's black metal time-warp, but who could ask for anything more? That era remains thee best by far. Goddess is thy heavy!"
4,Picture this,"Bought it for one song only, because I heard it just recently on the radio on 2012, did not know that this song was this old and was when he first started. Amazing how good he was back than and now. Worth buying all of his cds."
4,Seriouslly Funny,"This is coutry you can all enjoy. It is mostly more classical style of country, but Paisley is one of the more humorous songwriter of our time."
4,Great underwear,"Arrived on time and works exactly as i wanted it to. Wicks sweat and feels comfortable and supports. Deff order in a size up, i usually use Size M, but ordered a L and fit perfect"
1,"Briefs Great, Service Awful","When I received the briefs they were what I'd hoped for, however they arrived more than a month after I ordered them. The vendor, International Jock did not provide a tracking number or respond to my e-mails. Only after I'd applied for a refund from Amazon did the package arrive - without apology or explanation from International Jock.I'd recommend the Bike briefs if you like jockey style, sweat-wicking underwear (they run small in size). But find a vendor other than 'International Joke'."
2,Crashed already,"The player would be acceptable were it not for an annoying defect of the DVD player, which re-plays every 5 secs or so. It is, of course, under guarantee, but the logistics involved in taking advantage of this from here make it impracticable."
1,"This camera is horrible, don't waste you money",This camera is not worth the $20.00 that I spent for it. The pictures are blurry. You can't made out what so of them are half of the time. Don't buy this camera if you are looking for quality good pictures.
4,Surprisingly good!,"If you're looking for spectacular, prize winning photos, you aren't going to get it with a pen cam. However, we use this camera extensively in our lab and in the field for dental prosthetics. For analytic photos and (in the case of my frequent goofing off) spur of the moment snapshots, this is a good product for the price. Nothing pretty, no fancy settings, just point and shoot. Good camera for a kid or for someone who isn't hallucinating that they are the next Ansel Adams."
1,This Digital Camera STINKS!!,If you are looking for a digital camera that work well. Than this is not one that you are looking for. The product might be cool and portable. But please do not buy it! When I might 2 days ago it was $30 but it was on sale for $20. So I bought it and I almost open it. But if I open it I won't be able to return it. So I went to see some reviews on the net. And found out it was a stinking digital camera! So be like me and don't buy it! Unless you can get it for free. Aim me at Animeprincessx2 if u have questions!
1,to slow,"My goodness - could this book have dragged anymore than it did? The pacing was too slow. Mariel was priggish, missish and out there pious which led her to be very judgemental, which was not a very nice characteristic in her. Edward seemed almost too slick to be likeable. So there you have it - neither was very easy to like therefore not an interesting story."
5,"great ppv,except for gm match","ok survivor series was very entertaining, butwut the hell is this tna crap. tna is yeah,very good wrestling,but they wrestle twice a week though,wwe wrestles almost wrestle every single night. so tna can put more on the line in 1 night. wwe has more than wrestlemania also, royal rumble is awesome,survivor series has the ss classic match,by the way raw vs sd,awesome match.....and then there is summerslam which is like a mini wrestlmania. so if tna can get past a 1.0 for ratings and mayb bring some trouble for wwe like wcw did then cool, another wrestling war.and believe it or not.but history will repeat if there is a war."

Great wrestlers and i can't wait for this match and build-up"
1,Old edition.,This was not the edition that I was looking for. It was an edition that was released in 1997 and contained solutions that did not match to problems that were in the Calculus book. Waste of money. Don't buy it.
4,Correction to skeptic above,"As to Maltin writing his material, the author was all of 19 when he assembled this book: I don't think his allowance covered ghost writers. This was the first film book I ever purchased and I still refer to it now and then, a solid effort filling a hole in the literature."
4,sturdy,Love the whips - This is my third set because I keep forgetting the cold temperature of the butter - sometimes I'll stick very cold or frozen butter in the bosch and the whips don't like that. But these are great!
5,Couldn't believe I found it!,I couldn't believe I found this! I have looked for years! I even tried to contact scholastic to find it! They couldn't! Great job!
2,not very good... at all,"I had been considering purchasing this game for a while. Then I saw it for half price and picked it up.I don't think it was worth it for half price, so it definitely isn't worth it for full price.Now, I like snood. It's a fun little time waster. But I was really hope for some improvement from the web game. There doesn't seem to be any though.The biggest let down is that the dual screen's features weren't made use of. Gameplay takes place entirely on the top screen. Only the d-pad and A button are used. While you're playing, the bottom screen just says ""Pause?"" The bottom screen is also sometimes used to display scores, or a picture is shown, but otherwise is useless. The touchpad feature isn't made use of at all.The music and graphics are nothing special. They aren't awful, but again, I was expecting more for a DS game.If you want a good puzzler that really makes use of the DS, try Meteos. It is a bit pricier, but is well worth the extra money."
2,Exactly what I expected: Not much at all.,"I bought this game knowing quite well that it was subpar. It was an ironic purchase meant to get a few laughs amongst myself and others. In that regard, the game met my expectations."
3,Overrated. Subpar for Gordon Liu,"I heard over and over again about how good Dirty Ho was, how it was a classic, a must see. Well, I finally saw it and it was terrible. So why did I give it 3 stars? The two fight scenes in the middle of the movie, with the wine connoisseur and the antique merchant, was probably the best fight scenes I've ever seen. Besides that, the movie was horrible. The plot was stupid. I still don't understand why they were trying to kill Gordon Liu when there were at least 10 other brothers. Maybe I missed something. The fight in the windy tunnel was so bad I skipped ahead to the next scene.Dirty Ho is worth a watch for the two above mentioned fight scenes, but other than that, avoid at all cost!"
4,Decent release for a so/so sequel.,"This is a review for the DVD itself, not the film. I was a bit skeptical on buying these films because they're MOD, but I was quite surprised at how well these DVDs were put together. I just finished watching Part 2 and I'm not disapointed. The video quality is decent for the most part, with a bit of glitches every now and then, I'm satisfied with the results. The audio was decent, too. It was just extremely quiet and I had to turn my TV up to 40 as opposed to my usual 18. The special features aren't phenomenal, stuff I've seen already when I got the flick on iTunes, but they're entertaining for those who haven't seen 'em. I just wish they had added the behind-the-scenes that MTV had. I would definitely get this DVD (if you don't mind paying 15 bucks for a burnt copy)."
5,Unbeatable at the price,"This machine has it all - available under $$$ too. Shop around and you'll even find it under $$!Key points to consider:Region free with just a few remote keypresses. Can also select a specific region, in case an RCE encoded disk gives you a problem.Plays NTSC-PAL and PAL-NTSC (PAL widescreen gets a little stretched if viewed on NTSC TV, due to limitations with the ESS chip they use, but this is not a serious problem by any means).Auto-sensing 100-240V power supply - take it anywhere!Add to that a digital DTS output (not optical, but hey!) and you have an amazingly high-spec machine for a fraction of the cost of its competition."
4,Great DVD Player,This player looks sleek and capable of playing NTSC discs on PAL TV. Region hacking is possible. Ideal for a gift to someone special living in India.
3,Great for the price,"I can't complain too much. I got a little more than I paid for and that's the good news. The bad news is that it took forever for me to set it up and I'm very good at reading instructions. Also, that guy who put in his review that you could hack into this thing and make it multi-regional forgot to warn people about the smartchip in recent dvds that won't play if your dvd player has been messed with. Also, it takes forever sometimes to read certain dvds (like 5 minutes)."
2,"Poor quality, very flaky",Picture freezes. Audio/Video sync is lost. Very slow response to rewind and forward commands. Choppy action. Overall very poor quality product.Only good thing is the picture quality. Much better picture quality than apex. Otherwise apex is much better.
2,Cheap and Frustrating,"Bought this from [local store] based on the low price. What a disappointment. The remote is terrible. Very poorly designed and after few months remote stopped working. Too bad there was no manufacturers code available to use universal remote. Ocassionally CD tray doesn't open.Picture quality was OK.Overall, very frustating. Never buy Daewoo again."
1,"After only 4 uses, mine's not working.","Well, I got my new DVD player and I tested it with a DVD, CD, MP3 over the course of a week or so......and on the 5th try the tray won't open. The screen normally says ""no disc"" when you turn it on, but mine is blank. I've tried to get through to Daewoo with no success so far. Maybe mine was a lemon. Who knows. But since it's within the 30 day return window, that's what I'm going to do.....Return it. Too bad because the features are great, sleek looks, fantastic price, but a brand new unit should work better than this."
4,"Good, feature-rich DVD player","Although I'm not wild about the profusion of manual controls on the unit (almost all duplicated on the remote), or the oddly slow response time on that remote, this DVD player is a great deal for this price range."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED!,"Please be aware that this sewing machine is all plastic and it does not perform as it should it's been less than two month and I can't get the machine to saw anything well, I think mine is defective now I don't now what to do or were to return it."
1,Buyer beware. This is not your mother's Singer.,"Buyer beware. This is not your mother's Singer. They sold it off years ago and have used the name to sell cheap and poor designed sewing machines.Not happy with at all. I have used it 4 times in 1 year, very light repair stuff. Now it is totally unusable I have tried to contact Singer many times by email and they tell me to call between the hours or 9 and 5 Monday through Friday while at the machine. This is very hard to do when you work for a living. A local repair shop said it is the poor design of the bobin assembly and needs to be replaced, but doesn't recommend it because the replacement is just as badly designed.And like many of the other reviews a Singer repair shop is not close at all."
4,>>*^*^ Pandora of Athens^*^*<<,"It was a great book I thought. It talked lots about her feelings, and than this guy changed her life just like in ""Pharoah's Daughter.""This other guy named Socrates he ends up going to jail i did not get that part in the book.But it was a pretty good book I sayby Tyra"
3,Instructions would be helpful,"The Archos Jukebox Player-Recorder is a great piece of hardware that is almost unuseable for lack of user-friendly software to drive it. It looks sharp, feels great in your hand, and has a legible display, but after spending 5+ hours trying to figure out how to use it, I'm ready to give up! The instruction booklet is inscrutable and I still have not been able to organize and play the songs I've copied to the disk. Take a lesson from Apple and make it EASY for human beings to operate. Otherwise its just an expensive doorstop."
2,Archos buyers beware,"The thing worked great for a year. The recording function did a great job transfering a bunch of vinyl to mp3, and the sound was good. Then the AC adaptor cord broke. Couldn't just use a Radioshack replacement, so I gave ARchos another 30 bucks for their version. Then the power started crapping out for no apparent reason. I've tried new batteries, new software and everything else, including Archos customer support, which is absolutely non-existent crap. Now the thing only runs when plugged into an AC outlet, making it rather useless. Archos buyers beware!"
1,Look at another product,"I guess some poeple have found a lot of happiness in this product, but I have had a very poor experience. I've gone through two of these. The first one began malfunctioning a few months after I got it. When I went to email Archos, they never answered. Then I tried their customer support phone number and finally got through after about 5 tries. I succesfully returned it, (which was hell in and of itself), and the Archos poeple gave me a new one in the mail a few weeks later. It came with about 7,000 fragmented files. When I managed to recover them, I was unable to delete them. I was also unable to remove any mp3s that I put on the player. I dont even try to turn it on anymore, because it takes over a minute to turn on, and if it gets hit in the slightest, it restarts or freezes. I wasted 300 dollars on this."
5,James Lee Burke's Trip to the Dark Side,"The Dave Robicheaux novels by James Lee Burke have always had a spiritual component --see IN THE ELECTRIC MIST WITH CONFEDERATE DEAD-- but in BURNING ANGEL the supernatural darn near takes center stage with the presence of a real, honest-to-gosh no-doubt-about-it ghost. I loved the series before...now I'm really hooked."
4,Nice Book,"This is a nice little book to take with you wherever you go. Although it was a little worn, it was still in pretty decent condition. Recommend it for those interested."
3,Beautiful Norma but.....,"In this recording, Sutherland is splendid in her vocal achievements, but where is the Norma's soul? In the last act, where are the force and the dramatic voice and interpretation ? Caballe and Callas interpretations, were more completes. Norma is one of the most difficults roles of all, because is very important a great vocal quality, and the force of a dramatic soprano. Horne is a great Adalgisa, one of the most important performer of this role. Alexander is the worst Pollione of the discography. Very ugly voice, very bad vocal technic. Pollione is a very important character in this opera. And the Oroveso is also the worst of the Discography. Bonynge is a ""rutinier"" director, the orchestra seems as a band. Great directors in this opera are Muti and Serafin. This opera recording is beautiful, for Sutherland and Horne, but very superficial, with very bads Pollione and Oroveso. The Sutherland record with Bergonzi, Siepi, and Horne is better than this recording."
3,Ok Machine,"I just got this and bought it for the Aiwa reputation and reasonable price. The Q sound has an echo effect which is kind of anoying. What I am most disappointed about is that there is no good bass sound. I own 2 other Aiwa stereos which are bigger and more pricey but boy do they have bass. All in all you get what you pay for. If you want better sound, spend more $$$. Aiwa is a great brand to consider but maybe not this model."
1,12 NOT 48,There are only twelve laterns in this kit not forty eight. Plus since the luminaries are sold by target they are not eligible for super-saver shipping.
1,wanna-bees,"Boring, choppy songs which are nearly indistinguishable from one another. If you are looking for something fresh and new, this is not it. Instead of buying this album... go buy Hot Rocks."
5,Pleasently surprised,"I took a shot of this no-name TV and have only been pleased with the results. I just bought another smaller version (32). I also have two other name brands (Pan & Samsung) which I like and work well, but honestly I like this TV the most. It seems to have the best picture in HD and especially on the regular/normal mode TV of the group. It has the same codes as a Zenith so maybe they are the same, which I cannot say with any certainty. What I can say from my experience that I am very happy with it after 6 months. The price point is only a bonus, the quality seems to be there whatever the price."
1,Died in two years,"Just a quick warning: while the features/price of Olevia are decent (except the finicky remote), this is the very first TV I've owned in my 62 years that has died; and in rather short order - two years. Apparently (?) the capacitors on the power board have problems so the set stopped powering up - and mine is not an isolated incident (Google ""Olevia power problems"").Pretty big ticket item to be worrying about repair bills two years down the road - and hefty to be lugging to the electronics shop.I'd stay away from this brand."
3,Too good to be true?,"I have seen some amazing prices on this tv for a while now at amazon being sold by other members, some as low as $375. This just seems a little ridiculous to me that someone would be selling a brand new tv for this price. Has anyone run into this before? And if you bought from one of these sellers, did you receive the tv as promised or did you have any problems?"
5,"CUBA 101 , A REQUIRED COURSE.","THIS IS A COMPLETE STUDY IN GREAT DETAIL, OF WHERE CUBA HAS BEEN, WHERE IT IS NOW, AND A VISION OF THE FUTURE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE FORBIDDEN ISLAND. SOMEDAY I HOPE TO VISIT CUBA, THIS MOVIE HAS HELPED ME PLAN FOR THAT DAY. IT IS NEW AND UP TO DATE."
4,An Awesome Band!!!,"I have just started listening to the Groovie Ghoulies, and they are an awesome band!!! They put a whole new spin on rock music with fun lyrics and songs that you will want to hear over and over and over. Though I would suggest ""Travel's With My Amp"" over this one...this is a good cd that would be good in any collection."
3,My Review,"It's a bit insane that sewing machines no longer come with covers.This particular case is a little on the cheapside material-wise,but will probably hold up if you're not putting the cover on & pullingit off constantly, as the clasp seems a bit flimsy. The handle, seemsfairly solid & sturdy enough to last, but is not the most comfortableone I've ever used. The case is roomy enough to fit a machine & a fewextras. This could also mean that your machine will be clunking back& forth inside if you aren't very careful to hold the case upright, ordon't 'pad' it a bit.This product deserves only an average rating. If sewing machinescan't automatically come with their own covers, then the onesavailable for purchase should be a little bit better in quality& made to last...It's very sad they aren't."
2,what the doctor may not tell you about prostate cancer,The information in the book seems to be outdated based on other book I received from you.
1,Not very informative,"You can find more information by visiting the web sites of major hospitals such as Mout Sinai, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Johns Hopkins etc. and then looking at the expertise of each doctor. Since I am in NJ those were the most convient yet my final choice was Hackensack University Medical center because of the procedure I chose and the skill of the surgeon which was equivalent to the one at Mount Sinai."
2,It's Deceiving!!,"I thought this product was great at first until I had to use the thread. It looks like it comes with a ton of thread, it's deceiving. There is very little thread on these spools, one sewing session on something that's not tiny and you'll be out buying more. I loved it as a storage case, but you'll definetly be buying more thread!!"
2,Out of date...Many bogus agencies listed.,I found many of the agencies listed were out of date. This book does not differentiate between the legitimate agencies and the bogus agencies & schools that are simply out to rip you off! There is no rating system on the agencies listed. Looking for an alternative.
3,"Good info, lousy packaging!","The information contained in this book is good, and great for beginners, but the packaging isn't the greatest - photocopied pages in a binder (mine fell apart after flipping through it once).The best advice I have been given is to just TRY! Don't rely on books to get you discovered or think that they will be a magic pill. YOU have to get out there and see what opportunities await. Internet resources such as PlusModels.com are full of great info (and free)."
4,Finally a sheet who is fitting my colgate 2 in 1!,"I bought a Colgate 2-N-1 Innerspring Crib Mattress for my daughter's crib, and I have had difficulty to find a fitted sheet who fit this mattress (51.6 x 27.2 x 6 inches).Those sheet fit the mattress, they are tight but they fit. They've shrinked a little bit after I've washed and dryed them, but they still fit.They're not super soft, but my daughter doesn't seems to mind."
3,quality is little less,It is a very pretty light shade of colors. The thread count is not as I expected but we will be using these as spares. I think I will stick to the name-brands from now on. The over-all quality is a little less than I thought it would be.
1,Misleading Description,"This product arrived today and I was not pleased when I opened the box. There were not one blue and one white sheet as described. Instead, I got two blue gingham patterned sheets. This I don't mind so much, if the sheets were of good quality - these do NOT feel like 'high-quality 200 thread count cotton.' They are very rough and scratchy and are almost sheer when held up to light. What I received is something I would expect to buy from a dollar-type store and I will be returning the sheets."
5,Tremendous Bang for the Buck,"Sessler paints a clear picture of each of the American V8 engine families during this time period. He presents the strengths and weaknesses of each design as well as their specs and histories. Even the novice reader soon knows why certain engines succeeded (e.g. the Chevy Small Block and Ford's 385 series Big Block) when others failed (the Ford 312 and Chevy 409), as well as which of the ""Off-Brands"" are good (Buick's 455 and the AMC 401 for example). I wish he had included more specs like bore spacing and engine weight in his data panels. Likewise I disagree strongly with his assessment of the V8 engine as ""For all intents and purposes dead and gone"". There have been a number of new V8 designs introduced since 1974 and some of the old designs are going to be around for decades to come. Overall however it is hard to think of a motor book that gives more bang for the buck than this one!"
2,Practical not so practical,"What's wrong with this book? There is no thorough explanation of the concepts of cryptography, he just starts off taking shotcuts and with code examples that are absolutely not mature.I have a theoretical background in cryptography, but often had to read the text many times over before I could understand what the author was trying to say.This is the starting point for a practical guide on java cryptography, an introduction, but by no means enough.I would have considered giving it 3 stars, weren't it not that het appendix A on Base64coding, another topic that the author doesn't treat, is completely missing !"
1,lightweight machine good for lightweight jobs,"I bought this machine a few years ago but just pulled it out now to make a few tutus for my niece. I've already gone through 3 broken needles. Tulle is not a heavy duty fabric by any means but once you try and gather some material for layering, the needle breaks.I'm sad to say that this was a bad investment. I would have rather paid more for a better machine."
2,What was I thinking?,"Probably the worst TV special I've seen. I ordered thinking as a child that this was really something to see, but was sadly reminded how disappointed I was then.Definitely, not worth it."
2,Look elsewhere,"This book was not good. It was conversationally written and thus easy to read, but if you are really paying attention and trying to learn something, you will notice inconsistencies and places where the chronology of events is not clear.For example: the Due Obedience Law is passed (exempting low-ranking soldiers from prosecution for dirty war crimes, as they were following orders). Next paragraph: ""Despite government actions favorable to their interests, the officer corps remained unrepentant."" Next paragraph - a group of soldiers protest. Next paragraph: ""The Due Obedience Law followed."" Huh?And that is just one example... one chapter was so jumbled I couldn't even follow it. If I could do it all over again, I'd choose one of the other histories of Argentina."
4,well written and strait to the point.,well written and strait to the point.Only the Falkland's war is not well covered a little more information would be nice.
1,Did not work.,I ordered this item 2 times and both time it did not work. The first time the CD would not play and the second the radio did not work. I gave up.
5,"I'm waiting for a Special (DVD)Edition of ""NIGHT MUST FALL""","For Christ's sake ! When we'll have a DVD version of this classic film? Enough of blood , bad taste & illiterate screenplays! ""NIGHT MUST FALL"" deserves a Special Edition DVD ,with commentaries by one of our distinguished film historians ( like Rudy Behlmer,for instance)."
3,Not What I Expected...,"Tonight I watched this movie that came on cable tv... it looked like it had a lot of promise. Not to say it was terrible or that no one would like it, it's just that it is kind of strange.... A little melodramatic too. Rosalind Russell is wonderful, as is Robert Montgomery in the main character. It was a pretty good movie... just strange and scary. Overall good, but think it over before you watch it... leaves you with the chills... lots of murder and suspense. Not Hitchcock like, but more just plain old scary. Just wanted to warn you... don't watch it alone in a dark house! :o)"
3,Helpful but not essential; there's better info online,"With a game that's the size and scale of ""San Andreas,"" you need every bit of help you can get. And this guide offers bits of help -- maps, captures, hidden features and, most importantly, an overview of the story and each mission so you'll know what to expect.Most of the time the guide is great at telling you what you'll be doing... but doesn't offer much advice on how to do it. And, sure, part of playing this game is figuring stuff out for yourself. At the same time, this is a GUIDE and too often when I was repeatedly struggling with a mission, I'd flip to it in the book and get no help at all.There's a wealth of better material online for 100% less than the guide's considerable cover price (my favorite is: www.bellaonline.com/gaming/w/sanandreas/). However, my computer is two floors above where I game, so... I keep my hard-copy guide by the TV and every so often it helps out."
2,Wrong where it matters most,"The whole reason I bought this guide was for the horseshoes,tags,oysters, and photo ops. Well first off I found mistakes in all of the above. The photo ops are completely off 100 %. The horshesoes are all wrong on the map and a couple of the descriptions look like they just photoshopped a picture of a horseshoe onto another picture and made up a spot. If your gonna make a buisness of doing books like these hire someone to double check your info at least. Not to mention the lack of real in depth info on how to really pass any of the side missions. Like someone before me mentioned it almost felt like they just played through the story missions and wrote down what the game already tells you. I just wanna say thank you Brady for wasting my 20 Bucks. Spend it well, I didn't."
4,More a hintbook than a Strategy Guide,"The book was excellent but for those who have a PC would prefer theX BOX hints also have hints for PC. The light was shining on those who had X BOX not a PC. It does not suggest any of the schools which makes it difficult for those who have trouble, lets say in driving school."
5,Great guide to a classic game!,I found this to be quite helpful in assisting with playing the game and even finding different things on the map at large. I also love how it was quite colorful and designed like a comic book of sorts. It is highly recommended for anyone who plays GTA San Andreas!
2,"Other, better resources","I got this book from my library to check out the recipes it offers. I have to say, I was less than impressed - I'm glad I didn't buy a copy. If you want to reverse diabetes, I highly recommend Eat to Live by Dr. Joel Fuhrman or Reversing Diabetes by Dr Neil Barnard. Both of these doctors recommend vegan eating plans to cure what ails you. I have been carefully following the plan laid out by Dr Fuhrman and in 3 months I brought my A1c from 12.2 down to 6.1, WITHOUT ANY MEDICATIONS. The neuropathy in my big toe is gone. I have never felt better."
3,Mud Soap,"This soap is by far the best I've used in awhile. I'm not a big beauty buff, and don't usually buy $10+ dollar bars of soap. I bought it because I developed a nasty case of psoriasis on my shins. It seems to be helping slighty, but I have yet to see it make a real impact after using it for a month now."
3,Expectations were too high.,"Firstly, I'll say my rating is based on my expectations.The product itself seems to be good quality, and I like the particles in the soap for exfoliating the skin. It smells fairly nice, and is good as an all-over body bar in the shower.With that said; I was hoping this mud bar would be more like a budget ""Wonderbar."" Unfortunately, it severely dries out my face, and I would not recommend it for those with sensitive skin."
3,"Meh,","Bought this from Walmart as an emergency serger, just for temporary use. While it worked allright, I wouldn't buy it for regular use. I have a brother serger as my main machine, which I find infinitely easier to use, and more consistent. The singer machine I found extremely hard to thread, and very noisy and rattly sounding. It did do it's job, but it wasn't great. Affordable though. Meh."
2,I wish I had read the reviews. I never would have bought this book.,"I am very disappointed in the book.The first half is nothing but the woman whining on how everyone picks on her. Exhusband,lawyers,judges and child welfare. Plus she tells us she had a crush on Maurice Gibb from the BeeGees.Who cares.Her point in doing this is to show how her life was like before the dog came along.over80 pages . I could tell you the whole 80 pages in a couple sentences. She had a bad divorice and trouble getting her kids back because of bad lawyers.I have a 2 legged chihuahua and was hoping to read about how this woman helped her dog. well I didn't. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Not about a Dog,"Isaw the dog on a talk show on TV, so I thought maybe I would purchase the paperback the dogs owner wrote. The book really isn't about the dog at all. I realize the author needed to give background on how the dog came into her life and how she came to show the dog. But 90% of the book is dedicated to her hatred of her ex-husband, her hard luck life and what a hard ball woman she can be. I am all for womans rights and the need to fight back, but I bought the book to read about the dog, not about the womans personality."
2,I Wish I Would Have Read the Reviews!,"The other reviewers hit it right on the mark ~ this book uses the ploy of an amazing story about a dog to sell a book that is poorly written about someone's messed up (and yet still not interesting) life. The author goes off on everything that is wrong in her life and how it is all her ex-husband's fault but no one sees it . . . hello, I picked up the book to read about the dog! I don't know how this book ever got published in the first place. Save yourself the time and look up the dog's inspiring story on the internet and skip reading this author's poorly written ramblings."
3,"Good Picture, Poor Sound","The picture is excellent, the Television has lots of features, however, depending on the luck of the draw, the sound may [disappoint]. I bought this TV a year ago and ended up reselling it, due to poor sound and Samsung's failure to correct the problem. As James has stated earlier a buzzing sound develops in this TV. i brought it into a Samsung Authorized Repair center and they said they fixed the problem. However, when I brought it home the problem re-emerged 5 minutes later. I still think Samsung makes a great tube and I would imaging the newer version of this TV has fixed this glaring defect."
1,Windows 2000 : A Beginners Guide,"This book is NOT designed for beginner's.The layout is confusing and fussy! It has not been written for beginners in mind or even those who have some basic idea of networking and of operating systems, like myself. You may find this book useful perhaps as a reference guide only.Want to learn about Windows 2000? - pay the price and sit a tutored course and be led by example as to what the OS is about!, your money would be better spent.Maybe it would be easier to understand if it were not written in American?"
5,This is my favorite,"of Natalie's writing books. I think it is especially good for those who edit themselves as they write. Natalie gives you permission to write badly. You can always clean it up later. She encourages us to let loose and and get it down on the page. And if you're blocked, she offers lots of ""try this"" exercises."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER*,"I had to read this book for a creative writing class, my junior year in high school. After reading this book, I have lost all respect for my teacher for just asigning us to read it. I cant believe anyone who is interested in writing could believe this woman, who clearly knows nothing about creating writing! all she did was force herself to talk about not forcing your writing. i even ripped out pages of this book because it made me so frustrated and mad to know that books like these can even get published! NEVER READ THIS BOOK IT IS A DISGRACE TO ALL BOOKS IN THE WORLD AND WRITING IN GENERAL."
2,Disappointing,"I really tried to like this book. It's not poorly written or uninteresting but the name dropping and faux modesty become tedious. And that's too bad as he obviously has some stories to tell. He so badly wants to appear accessible and yet every anecdote shows the naivete of the super-rich. Does he really think it was his charm and skill that provided him with these opportunities and successes?We tend to dislike in others what we dislike in ourselves. I think he sums himself up perfectly when telling us, on the eve of his consecration, how he feels about St. Paul: ""Although he is my patron saint, and I find his theology profound, I have never really liked Paul's personality. He seems to have been something of a misogynist, and although he spoke as if humble, he boasted a bit much about his sufferings for Christ, or so it seems to me.""Couldn't have summed up Paul (Moore) any better myself."
4,As Much Fun Now As When I was a Kid,"I grew up with this book and never knew of the others in the series. Seeing as my daughter loves dogs I had to buy this when I saw it in this new edition.An opera singer has moved into the house next to Harry's. The singer practices all day long, singing loud and high. Harry does not like this sound. Harry tries a number of ways to get her to stop. These do not please his family. But finally, a good way is found and everyone is happy.As a parent, one of the things I like about this book is that it is clear that Harry is not being good when he howls, leads cows or a marching band, or other tricks. Although we want Harry to succeed, we also want it to be in the right and good way. This book knows the difference.I loved this book as a kid and I still do. My daughter loves it (hopefully my son will too)."
3,great treats for dog but...,"I have been buying these treats for my dog for some time but I'm honestly getting sick of the price increases...how about 2.00 per container in the last year.Anyway, the treats are not filled with a lot of junk and the glucosamine is good for your dog's joints. I recommend this product but I do wish they'd stop raising the prices continually."
4,Great Buy!,This 5-pack is definitely worth it. It's a great beginner set. The teachers make the videos interesting and easy to learn and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous. The 20 minute sessions make it easy to mix and match into a customized routine. I have been doing several routines for the past 3 weeks and found it easy and relatively painless to get results in my flexibility and muscles. I plan on buying the rest of the yoga zone collection very soon!
4,good in some,this is a good product for some. in some of my windows the lower pane just slide over the wedge ans couldn't really hod it tight in place. whether it is a problem of the width of my windows or the product I am not sure. but works on some.
2,Technical superiority; no selfness,"Great artists have been and will always be immitated. It is a pity that Mr. Volodos insists in doing so with V. Horowitz. Mr. Volodos has an insuperable power and execution technique, and should stay away from the ever tempting idea of being not only equal, but superior to Horowitz. His first CD (Piano Transcriptions) revealed that he had a great capability; in the Carnegie Hall Debut I was expecting something about himself, not more copying, which results caricaturesque. About the CD presentation, only the very, very cheap come without a booklet. In summary: disappointing."
4,Good enough but not hi-fi,"Remember that you get what you pay for. The SADX-950 is a good value, but is defenitly not an hi-fi system. The SADX-1050 will produce less harmonic distortion. On the other hand, if you do not plan to invest too much for the speakers (e.g. less than 250$ for the audio front pair), then this system should fit your needs. Note: requires an amplified subwoofer (not a passive one)."
2,Not one of her best.,"I love most of Lynne Graham's books and eagerly await new ones, but this one exemplifies and exaggerates her tendency toward wimpy heroines and unlikeable heroes. Hope basically did nothing but wait for Andreas to wake up; she allowed him to treat her horribly without standing up for herself. He was a jerk until the last page or so. And does every heroine have to get pregnant?"
1,Just bad,"I usually Like Lynne Graham books but the heroine in this book was very frustrating , she lets the guy insult her , treat her like trash and yet she still keeps on practically begging the guy to stay with her never standing up for herself only for a few brief moments at the end of the book. Like another reviewer said she was a complete door mat. Also I never get that feeling of real remorse from the ""hero"" for treating her badly."
5,Great southern gospel music,I ordered this for my mom for mothers day and she loved it. It is so hard to find chuck wagon CDs in stores. Was so happy Amoazon had it. She listens to it everyday!!
2,pox is no good,"I think that pox is a horrible game, unless u r interested in conquering the world usin alienz....pox is not fun, all u do is kill other enemies and build your own alien with parts u collect... tho, barely anyone has it, so there is no point in battling n e one, unless u buy 2 of them..."
1,Nightmare software,"If you want to subject yourself to the worst installation routine in software history, go buy Exchange 2007. We went through 6 complete rebuilds before finally throwing in the towel on the product.During install, you will have to install dozens of server components, roles, features, all by hand. You will have to use the Power Shell to script, edit the registry on multiple machines, prep the domain, the forest, etc.If the install fails, your active directory will be corrupt and you will have to use the server utilities to clean it out.Even if things go right, you are looking at an install that takes hours and requires multiple reboots.I can't even comment on the functionality of the product, since I became so frustrated I returned it."
2,Fanstel caller ID G99M,"For those of you who are interested in this Fanstel model, just be aware that paying a high price for an item does not guarantee it to be of the best quality. This unit I bought has a clock diplay together with the day etc. This clock gains 24 minutes every 24 hours, providing an incoming call does not recalibrate it when a call comes through from the central office. Hense, this Fanstel does not get my recommendation"
3,IT WAS OKAY,BOOK HAD A COUPLE OF BAENEFICIAL CHAPTERS BUT MOST OF IT WASN'T ANY HELP. iT WAS A WHILE AGO SO i DON'T REMEMBER MUCH
2,Pricey for what it does....,"Well, I bought this vacuum when it was still new on the market, and it was very pricey at about $300. It definately wasn't worth it, and probably won't buy another one. The vacuum fills too fast, clogs too easily, and isn't too sturdy. As a matter of fact, I'm now searching for a new and more sturdy vacuum. Yesterday, the electrical cord came out of the vacuum itself. If you are looking for a really good vacuum, this really isn't the way you want to go. It's very highly over rated. It does pick up a lot off of the floor, but it's really not worth the money if you want something that will last."
1,I hate this toothbrush,"This toothbrush drains the battery in 2 - 4 weeks. Also, the water get inside it. The replacement parts as expensive as the entire brush."
1,This Product should be Recalled - It will break in no time!,"AS many other reviews stated, the unit is not built to last.The snap on plastic bottom in the battery compartment will break even with the utmost care. Water and humidity will get in and zap out the circuitry - as well as shorting out the batteries. The battery cantacts are consructed of such soft metal that the pressure of the battery itself will stretch the contacts so they no longer make a connection to the batteries.My unit lasted a bit longer than some I've read here - 3 months.I liked the concept of not being stuck with a rechargeable unit which has batteries that cannot be replaced - unfortunatley this unit will need to be replaced many times over the rechargeable units (which have more power in the brush strokes than this unit).From all these reviews it is obvious that this is a defectivly designed unit, and should be recalled, discontinued, or perfected."
1,It is Junk,This was a waste of money. Yes it was powerful and good toothbrush for about a week. But it isn't waterproof so it stopped working. I can't believe they make toothbrushes such as this and not make them waterproof. It hasn't worked since the first week. Don't buy this item. Listen to the reviews. It will not work for longer than a month! It's junk!!
3,When it worked it was great,"Mine stopped working after a year :(I have bought altogether for my family and friends about 5 of these, three of which stopped working after various times.One recovered after it was dried out - I guess somehow a bit of moisture got inside, two however did not. I tried to keep mine dry since the beginning but... Philips - what the hell ! ? I would highly recommend it since I like everything about it (especially the fact that it is battery powered so you can travel with it easily to Europe etc.) except if it lasted."
1,Stopped working at 31 days!!,Bought 1 in December and it stopped working in January. Returned it and got 1 that stopped working in February - one day after the warranty expired. DO NOT BUY!
1,Don't buy it!,"I have owned 6 over the past 5 years. They don't last; which is sad, because I really like them when they do work."
1,Do not purchase this product,"This product is junk. I have had two of them and both of them failed. This is not a sketchy complaint. I am an engineer and, while some reviewers tell you to put silicon grease around the o-ring, I don't believe that is something a consumer should have to do when purchasing a product. I expect a company to sell me a product that will not break within a year. There are design flaws with this product. Unless you do not mind purchasing the same product every 6 months for clean teeth, do not buy. I will not again."
1,not rechargeable,This is NOT rechargeable. Do you really want to keep on buying batterries for this? Get a rechargeable one instead.
4,Great for travel,Good for traveling and battery operated. So far it's worked fine and have not no issues with a sonicare product.
1,Great Toothbrush Until It Stops Working...,"If you are thinking about purchasing this I would highly discourage you. My wife bought one of these and she liked it so much that she bought one for me too. Within about 4 weeks her brush began shutting off and eventually stopped working. I was hopeful that mine would last. However after about 4 weeks of total use, mine would cut off after about 10 seconds of use. Eventually it completely stopped working. It was not batteries or any other obvious problem. Both were defective. It most likely stems from water in the internal compartment. It was very frustrating. I would recommend going with an Oral-B or a more durable Sonicare. Don't get me wrong, when this thing was working, it really did clean my teeth well, but it quickly failed. Invest in a longer lasting brush!"
1,Disappointment,"I left my rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush behind on a trip and bought the battery powered Xtreme version. Now less than month later, it acts like the batteries are dead. New batteries don't make a difference then suddenly it comes on. Then it wont again. Right now about every 5th try. Like a fool I chucked the paperwork after 3 weeks since my other Sonicare was so amazingly dependable. But this product making me complete rethink Philips. Note to management: Step up to the plate and replace these products with ones that work."
4,Work fine for me..,"I am not sure how other reviewers used this, but I had no problem after 2 years. To be fair, I primarily used the toothbrush only on trips (I had another rechargeable at home), but my usually lasted a week at a time and I make these trips at least everyother week. Oh, I also brushed at least twice a day.I agree that the bottom cap and o-ring are not exactly the best, but I have no problem with water coming in. After brushing, I rinsed the whole thing and left it stand vertically. I am on my 3rd set of batteries now. For me, it was a $25 well spent. I like it because I can get battery for it anywhere. I would buy another when this one dies someday. The only thing this toothbrush needs is pausing every 30 seconds like its other models.11/16/09:3 months since my last review, my tooth brush died. I immediately ordered another one, same model. It came in orange color now and worked just as expected. I expect to use this for another 2 years at least."
5,Best sonicare brush I ever had-look after it!,"I've had mine for over 2 years and never had a problem, it works great and is excellent for traveling as you don't have to carry around a charger which doesn't work in some countries even with the right adaptors. The reviewers who complain about water getting into the battery compartment are obviously not looking after their toothbrush. You should remove the head after every use, shake and clean both head and handle which only takes a few seconds. I store the head separately and don't leave it on when not in use."
4,battery powered Sonicare,I am a Sonicare owner and bought these for my children as a gift. I wanted to see if they liked them before purchasing the more expensive models. They love them and are brushing their teeth more often and better now. The next purchase will be a rechargeable one.
5,Never knew,"I never knew that a toothbrush could make such a difference. I have been using regular brushes and the round shaped electric brush for years, this brush out cleans all those other brushed. I feel like I just came from the dentist every morning when I use it. I recommended it to several people I work for and I know that one has already ordered it for her family."
2,"Poor design, good idea","Good idea, but not designed very well. The brush goes too fast, the brush is too small and the hard plastic handle hits against your teeth, and rattles on them, if you don't have the angle just right. Also, when you brush your teeth normally, you turn the brush around and up and down; thus, water running out of your mouth, goes all over the housing which allows water to get inside the housing."
2,Buy an Oral-B,"I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes in the past but thought that theSonicare Xtreme Toothbrush, Battery Sonicwould be better. I did want a battery operated toothbrush for convenience.Rechargable batteries frequently would not work with this toothbrush. The off/on switch was very poor. Water, etc. collects under the toothbrush head (nasty). Toothbrush heads do not last long and do NOT clean as well as an Oral-B.I have replaced theSonicare Xtreme Toothbrush, Battery Sonicwith aOral-B Pro-Health Battery Toothbrush Precision Cleanwhich I love."
1,mine lasted 4 months,"It was too big for my hand. It sprayed toothpaste all over my shirt.My son told me about the the leaking problem so I always removed thebrush and rinsed it off and dried it and hung it on the wall inside the cabinet to dry.Almost exactly 4 months it started acting like I needed to change batteries.Then 2 days change batteries then I bought new batteries and it wouldn'teven turn on those .I emailed the company I purchased it from Sold by: HealthRight and their reply wassorry we only cover for 30 days try the manufacturer. That would have beennice if they would have sent me a number or email address, but nothing.SoI have 2 toothbrush heads I can't use and I know I will not buy another sonictoothbrush again. I'm thinking the Xtreme in the name stands for you are extremelylucky if the toothbrush keeps running."
4,Works good...,"I started using this product after my rechargeable Sonicare finally died (after four/five years). I have had this toothbrush for over a year and it works just as good as the rechargeable version. This unit is much more mobile because of the battery power, can be taken easily on travel trips, is cheaper than rechargeable version, and brush heads are easily found (best price at big warehouse stores).As for other review comments, I have not had any problems with water getting in the battery compartment."
1,The other reviews are right...,"It stopped working after 12 days. Sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No real time or money lost, except for the drive to the post office. But all of the other reviews that say this product won't work are correct."
5,A Song for My Father,"I did not know this album existed, WOW, I've lent it to friends, they also said ""WOW"". What talented fathers had such talented children, I smiled, I cried, I remembered and enjoyed!!! Grateful to have found this treasure."
4,Denzel and Wesley makes a woman beg for mo',This movie by Spike Lee demonstrates why he is one of the leading directors of ethnic movies today. His combination of Denzel Washington and Wesley Snipes was a treat for females of all ages. The chemistry they exuded was magical. This film had some of the film industry's best saxophone playing ever. The music was electrying and hypnotizing. The story was very moving and realistic as it follows the rise and fall of a musician and the people that come into his life when he's at the top and when he hits the bottom. An adult movie that will stay with you long after the movie ends.
1,mo better blues,I got the DVD's in a timely fashion but this DVD only plays on my laptop. I'm disapointed because it's one of my favorites and I was really looking forward to watching it on my big screen TV...
5,Built to last!,"We have 9 year old fraternal twin boys. One twin has autism. He has the mind of a sweet 4 year old who loves Thomas the tank engine, but is the size of a 12 year old weighing 90 pounds. We recently picked up a used 20"" BMX Boys Vertical Abuse Series Freestyle bike for our autistic son as the one he had with training wheels was just getting too small for him to ride. The training wheels arrived very quickly to us in Portland, Oregon from Niagara Cycle(out of NY). They fit perfectly on the new (used) BMX bike which has a tube frame just under an inch where you would attach the training wheels support brace. The training wheels are VERY SOLID AND STRONG and are built to last! They support our 90 pound son perfectly. He feels safe and confident riding his BMX bike. Thank you to other reviewers on this product, Niagara Cycle, Amazon, and to Wald! Keep up the awesome work!"
4,Great wheels,I bought these after my daughter's training wheels kept bending and she kept falling off of her bike. These wheels are easy to intall and are so sturdy! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is becasue one of the wheels had some sort of rust looking stuff where the silver was supposed to be.
5,Every Company Should Buy This Book,"I really enjoyed the way the author presented accountability, integrity, trust, and mission in a book that made sense. Not only that but the author defined each of these concepts in a realistic and business-practical way. Of all the trash I have seen from authors trying to bring a soft touch to the corporate scene, Marchica really nails it by speaking the truth AND giving us some guidelines for becoming the Accountable organizations we CAN be and SHOULD be. I wish someone had stood up like this long ago to show that accountability and integrity are right and necessary; not just for the sake of morals but because it's smart business. Every college student should read this. Every employee and leader should be train in these ideas."
3,Looks nice but wears poorly,"We loved the look of this Golden Harvest Cannes dinnerware--reminded us of being back in the south of France--but, disappointingly, they chip like crazy. We had purchased them as everyday dishes and we'll be lucky to get a full year out of them."
3,Updated review: these are not durable,"I needed new everyday dishes that could go well for entertaining as I don't have ""fine china."" I shopped all the kitchen stores, the malls, and catalogs, but these were hands-down the best value for the money.The plates are large, European-style, with a scalloped edge (gadroon?) and deep centers. There are no saucers, just large mugs. I got the burgundy color, which has a black accent on the rim and black spatters to give a rustic look. The bowls have large flat rims. They are made of a pottery-stoneware but seem rugged enough.Alas, these dishes are not durable. I lost quite a few plates to chips because the pottery is soft. These are inexpensive, so you could use them for occasional table settings, and they look nicely French Provence style, but for everyday use they are not durable."
5,Great Product,"I purchased these for my students to use in class because Amazon had a such a great price.As an English teacher, I can tell you the ""No Fear"" line has logical, accurate, and easy to follow translations of all their plays.A must for any student who struggles with Shakespeare."
5,Had to own it,A friend loaned me this book and after the first chapter I knew that I had to own it. Great book.
5,Great purchase,This was a great purchase of a CD I had been looking for. I received it in a timely manner and in good shape.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"Because of the title of the album, I thought it would be all of the music from ""Up in Central Park;"" however, only two songs from the show. All the rest sickenly sweet love songs from operettas. Put the album away, and now will await a rerecording of the original production."
1,Leaker,This Cusinart SB-5600 Supreme Super 600 60-ounce blender leaks. Don't buy it. Look for a better one. No sense in paying this much money for crap.
1,Cannot stand listening to this performance,"Time passes fast, and 1970 is a prehistorical age for this kind of music.I had the bad idea to buy this recording: Britten is directing this music disregarding his own annotations on the scores he adapted !! (I had to study them for a concert).But worst, soloists are singing in a terrible ""italian melodrammatic style"" (as we say ""with big potatoes in their mouth""). The chorus is too large, the tempo too slow, terribly slow. The brasses are untuned, the orchestra is not convincing at all.Dido and Aeneas follows the same destiny.Want to buy back my CDs :)?"
2,Not Worth The Money,"First, this set is teeny-tiny. I was a bit surprised at how small it was. My son loved it though, and began to play right away. This set didn't last a day in my house. All the little detailed pieces are now broken and even one of the astronauts. And my eight year old is a careful kid. I would look elsewhere before buying this again."
4,The Birdies Love This Suet,"I finally broke down and purchased 'a case' of suet when the cakes at the grocery store went up yet again. At first a case just seemed like a lot of suet, but as it turns out, if you have it on hand, then you use more.Now my winter feeders are busy. We get various Ladderbacks as well as Titmice, Chickadees, Goldfinches, Nuthatches, and once in a blue moon, a Pilated. So far everyone seems to love this suet --ok, not Pilated-tested -- so I'm happy.The cost is good, especially if you have Prime."
5,All great films,"These are Spike Lee's best work, with great plots and interesting characters, Spike Lee is able to make every race, color, and creed relate to these great movies. My personal favorite of the three was ""Crooklyn"" which is a film the whole family will enjoy."
5,A sweet and satisfying read,"Janetta, a city girl, is not certain that she will like visiting her grandfather in rural Georgia. She's never been in the country before and everything--including the mule--frightens her. Grandaddy, however, is a gentle man wise to feelings and needs of little girls. He soon puts her at ease by telling outrageous tall tales. Their relationship grows closer throughout a series of visits.This is a remarkably sweet--but never cloying--book. The book is a reprint of three previously published books, but the stories flow together so well that it seems as though they were originally designed to be one book. The chapters are short enough and contain enough pictures to encourage beginning chapter book readers. The characters are engaging and the stories are funny and frequently touching."
4,"Very Good, But Has Preservatives...","This coconut cream is a brand we buy locally. It is a brand we very much prefer, as we find it to be very good. It contains 70% coconut milk versus the usual 55% most of the other brands contain (and many brands do not even list this fact), so you are getting more coconut flavor in each can. The one big thing we DO NOT like is that it contains preservatives. This brand does not seem to be available without it; we checked their website. So, even though we like it, we are trying other brands without preservatives. This contains coconut milk--70%, water and potassium metabisulphite (E224). As yet, we have not been able to find another brand of coconut cream similar to this. We DO like that there are clear, easy to decipher, production and expiration dates on each can. Many brands do not do this. Hope this info is helpful!"
2,"Nice product, but not *that* nice","One day I bought a can of coconut cream at the supermarket, just to see what it was. One day, I got around to opening the can. It was thick n creamy, very yummy, excellent in my morning cup of cocoa chai, perfect for baked goods when moistness was needed. It went fast. Too fast. Now I can't find it on a store shelf anywhere in my town. Not even sure it was Savoy brand. But I was glad to find it here at Amazon. For $1.62 it's worth it to try and see if it's the same product that I liked so well. But $6.75 for shipping?! Not if I never eat coconut cream again. Even if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't pay $6.75 shipping for a $1.62 item of any sort. It's the principle of the thing."
5,Seife Strikes Again,"Charles Seife's books do more than just aim for that,""goshwow"" many popular science books do. DecodingThe Universe /has/ that but Seife will be able tosuprise even those of us that go directly to the Sciencearea of the bookstore.Decoding The Universe puts the idea of Information Scienceinto context with the rest of physics, from Einstienscosmology to the quantum world. Its done with a fun,light style that belies the depth of the subject, oftenexplaining things like Schrodinger's Cat or the speed oflight better than many books or television shows thatassume a general ignorance in the reader. Seife doesn'tbury you under numbers but he doesn't make you flip forwardeither as you bypass some simplistic explaination.Good stuff for those inclined towards science!"
3,A decent introduction for the unexposed layman,"A brave attempt to explain all of theoretical physics through the lens of information theory, without any math. Information theory itself is fascinating. Unfortunately, without math, there seems little point in the effort. The viewpoint is fresh, and the author is enthusiastic, but there's not much new material here. Most of the concepts were distillations of relativity and/or quantum mechanics that will already be familiar to a scientifically interested layman. If you can handle a tiny bit of algebra and are comfortable thinking numerically, then a better introduction is Pierce'sAn Introduction to Information Theory."
2,What use is a book which only covers IE4?,"The author makes clear from the outset that Netscape's version of DHTML is not even worth thinking about, and throughout the book displays his contempt for Netscape over and over again. However, for a web-developer, cross browser compatibility is very important, and this attitude is very annoying when trying to program a useful web page.I urge anyone who wants to be able to program pages that cater for everyone not to buy this book, and to go for one which covers all browsers."
5,I LOVE THIS CANDY!!!!!,I can't seem to find this in any store so i was very excited when i found it here. This candy is my favorite. Great product. Great taste!
5,gummy,"We just love this candy, and we live in a small town,and its only available here once in a while. Amazon was my last resort. It is fast and easy to just order a whole boxful, and divide it with my family. I haven`t met anyone who does`nt like this product,even my friend from Norway."
4,A contender!,"There is no ideal ""St. Matthew Passion."" But this one ranks with the best of 'em. ""Solti?,"" you ask? That's right: Solti. I've heard all of the other ones except for Klemperer's, and this one satisfies on a consistent level. Some of the others I only listen to one disc at a time; this one, all the way through. Not too fast, not too slow, not too solemn, not too sprightly. I guess Solti isn't known as a ""Bach specialist,"" but the ""Bach specialists"" whose CDs I own could learn a thing or two about making a satisfying recording like this one."
1,S....,"This is not an Emmylou CD. The inside cover summarizes her life and career, and says that the CD is a compilation of her favorite songs, but she is no where within earshot. She may have been present in the distant background, but barely recognizable if she is there at all. I don't understand why she would allow her name to appear on this album title and be used in this way."
4,Enjoyable and informative,"This book was very good. I learned alot about Tanzania's music history and culture but also about the way the music fits into and is made palleable by party politics and policy agendas. The CD was great as well, the varied singing styles were a good addition as were the interpretations of the lyrics. This book has helped to make me a fan of Tanzanian Taarab music. I also liked the fact that the author actually experienced some of what the other performers were feeling by becoming a member of one of the groups and singing with them. Good book overall, very descriptive."
4,Just started reading it,"I just started reading it, but it seems to contain much information on the subject. It is slow reading for me because she gives so many facts that you have to assimilate quickly in order to continue. The reason I bought this is because this culture is so very different than mine, I want to understand why these people think and do the things they do. I would recommend this book."
4,Kashif really tells it all on this extraordinary book,"I'm blessed I purchased this book earlier this month and tells me right here how I need to know and learn all about the music and record industry. This is a Extradordinary, more good-reading, more instructional Must for all Music lovers, listeners, musicians, singers, singer-songwriters, composers, producers, artists, and/or any1 that's real interested of trying out in the music biz. I recommend Donald Passman's book ""All You Need to Know About the Music Business"" 2 include along and recommendarily Quincy Jones' memoir along w/ others.I 'preciate the help of what R&B; and Music legend, artist, and producer Kashif tryin' 2 say. 'Preciate everything u talked 'bout this book. Enjoy it. It's very interesting stuff and u can't turn your back from it."
1,Black and Decker - Lost Quality!,"I purchased one of these blowers and it lasted one season. I made the mistake of getting another, identical blower. Bad move. It lasted about one season. I then purchased a completely different brand and it has run flawlessly for four seasons. Black and Decker used to be synonymous with ""quality"". This machine is a waste of money. I won't buy B&D again."
4,High back pressure,"This carbon filter does a good filtering job. However, it has extremely high pressure drop. If you expect to get a high flow think again. Good item if you don't need the water quick."
4,Water Filter,Seems to work very good. Price and the shipping was very reasonable. Seemed to also be the right size to replace the old one.
3,Box was toast; filter looks okay.,The filter arrived today despite UPS having thoroughly destroyed the box. It's a wonder the item arrived.Just hope the filter works: it's the most expensive one I've bought for my old under-sink unit.
1,Don't Buy This!,"Not only does this book have mistakes, but it is nothing like a real MCAT. The form of almost half the questions is totally different. Additionally, all the passages are either much easier or much harder than an actual MCAT, I thought. There were also a lot of questions I thought were either questionable or just plain stupid. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."
5,Heartbreakingly real and timeless,"This is a very powerful and moving film that, like most Billy Wilder films, gets better the more times you see it. The characters are free of cliches and completely believable. This film does as great a job as any I've seen of capturing addiction in all of its ugliness while also showing the hope to which those around addicts desperately cling."
2,Hasn't dated well.,"'The Lost Weekend' leaves a lot of fascinating questions unanswered - for instance, why wasn't Don 'Lester' Burnam fighting in the war? There are some remarkable sequences here, in particular the opera scene nodding to Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush', or the Kafkaesque purse-snatching incident. Throughout, Wilder emphasises the circle, the vicious circle, the noose, encircling even the narrative, ironising any 'cop out' move towards resolution, which, based on pure talk, has no solidity. This is one that will go on and on, ending only in death or madness.Still, this is Wilder's most overrated film, as dated in dialogue, assumptions and wearisome drunk hero as a Eugene O'Neill play; while the visual 'daring' now looks frequently risible. For a genuinely moving portrayal of a drunk, catch Melville's 'Deux Hommes Dans Manhatten'."
1,worthless because of the packaging,"The birds eat the stuff, the only reason it isn't a 0-rating.The ""easy-peel"" packages are totally worthless - 90% of the packages are sealed so tightly that it is impossible to open the pack without using a knife and getting greasy-gunk all over the place. A simple baggie would create far less mess, and be easy to open without requiring tools. The only reason I can think of to create such a lousy package is that they pour the hot suet directly into the lower tray of the pack, and thus save time at the expense of consumer annoyance.I will never buy a Heath-brand suet product again, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone but an enemy."
3,Update Please,"The book is well written, unfortunately in 2003.Approximately one third of the book is written for people with cameras based on video tape. With the migration to hard drive and now SDHC cards the portions of relating to tape, tape drive, tape library etc are lost on people with a whole different set of needs.Having said that, the sections that address issues of lighting, audio, camera handling etc are wonderful and make the overall purchase worthwhile. If the book were updated to cover digital clip management and issues it would be a five star purchase.If you do have a tape based camera I highly recommend the book."
1,Not the soundtrack,"This is a collection of hard rock stuff that was played briefly while the movie ran. This is NOT the soundtrack with all the dynamic sound and pulse raising music. I was so looking forward to getting this and driving the freeways. What a disapointment, don't buy this if your looking for the theme music. I've already thrown mine away."
3,Late review,"Was a good book for the time but way out dated. I grew up in the film/digital industry from 2000-2008 and i can say it was fun. Know this, the most expensive camera doesn't always make for the best pictures and the author misses this sometimes. I would sneak into weddings weeks before my job and take shots like my client wanted. this gave me time to work out new cameras, lens, settings, etc. It is very important to know your gear in your sleep. Weddings are too fast a pace to fiddle with your camera. Expierence is better sometimes to book smarts."
5,Love It!,"I don't mean to sound like a cheesy commercial, but this toothpaste has actually made brushing my teeth fun! The hot cinnamon flavor almost seems to tingle in my mouth, and the toothpaste is fairly easy to squeeze out without making a mess in the sink. To me, it's like chewing Big Red bubble gum that cleans your teeth! I'd never seen cinnamon flavor toothpaste before, but I now know that it's my favorite flavor, and I'm going to buy it again once this container runs out."
4,I'm still looking for blue food!,"I actually dog-eared pages as I read for things I wanted to go back and try. I ended up with 41 bent pages and some memorable experiences.""#94 Think about what other people are doing"" was a favorite one as was ""#22 Count to a thousand"".It is not life changing so much as simply life observing in a ""stop and smell the roses"" sort of way. I had fun reading it and think most people will be able to find something memorable if they actually try some of the experiments."
5,Making stories fun,My sister is using this to tutor my grandson - he is eight and has fun making up stories. Plus gives good practice on sentence building.
4,Gift for granddaughter,"She seemed to like it ok, but with so much going on at Christmas, I didn't see her play with it much. Maybe now that she's at home, she'll get in to it more."
4,Good for the price,"I've found the Cobra brand to be the best ""reasonably"" priced detectors out there. This one consistantly picks up our friends in uniform about 1/2 to a mile away. Not too many false signals. If you want LASR warning.... forget it. It's always too late no matter what you buy."
5,Complexity demystified,"In ""Making Things Work"" Yaneer provides the reader with an excellent, non-technical discussion of some of the more important concepts in Complexity science. Like other successful popularizers of science such as Carl Sagan, Yaneer has a gift for explaining difficult subjects in a way that everyone can understand. He then shows how these concepts can (and should) be used to address real-world problems such as the health-care crisis and education. It should be required reading for policy-makers and business leaders.For a more technical treatment, I'd recommend Yaneer's earlier book or better yet, take a course at NECSI."
2,Not all that,"It's ok, but when you click on GET PICTURES and click on one single picture, the entire folder just goes into the software program.The brightening-up-of-the-picture tool is real cool though.I still haven't figured out how to submit pictures to Ofoto.com yet. I have 25 free ones to claim, but their site is not navigation friendly."
4,It's a good book but...,"I found the PHP Black Book useful and informative, but it left me wanting a reference manual. It has some helpful code examples and a lot of great insights, but it doesn't give you the level of documentation on the functions you would need to write more complex code. Buy the PHP Black Book, but buy a reference manual, too."
3,Not bad but!,"I bought the book. I read the book and it is not to bad. The examples in there are good but not easy to read. When you look for a book with complete source code examples, then this is not the right book for you.All in all it has everything in it, but as I said it could be easier to read. So for starting with PHP there should be an second source."
3,not for all,"While other reviewers have lauded this book and it's question and answer format, I found it difficult to read, and understand. The question and answer format may work for some, but it is not for everyone. There were many sub-questions in the explanations that were not followed up on. As a novice to networking, I found a presupposition of knowledge of networking on the authors part. For an intermediate level user, who wants to know the nitty gritty of networking, it is great. For the novice... I am still looking."
3,Xavier Jamaux - Tokyo Eyes (Bande Originale Du Film),"Xavier Jamaux's soundtrack for the movie ""Tokyo Eyes"" ends up sounding like just that: a soundtrack. The tracks seem more like themes than actual songs, and that's a pity, because some of them, such as ""Hinano Loves,"" could have been beautiful if they had been extended. The album is rescued by a number of remixes at the end, including the wonderful ""Eye To Eye With You,"" which sounds like classic Bang Bang, Jamaux's other project. Zend Avesta put a dark spin on ""Bang! Bang! (You're Dead), and Alex Gopher turns ""Hi Love"" into a delicate downtempo track. But this album is too many appetizers, not enough meal."
5,Wow,"Such a wonderful mix of melodic harmony and pure primal rage, Reaches out and grabs you and refuses to let go, this is what its all about."
3,For nephew,"The toy got here on time and looked exactly like the picture. However, as most of the reviews stated, the button is a little hard to push... but not overly so that it is frusterating. it's fun and he loves it."
1,Be careful to buy a Archos who disregards a customer!,"I purchased a Jukebox Recorder 20 at the online shop of Archos Europe, but the product didn't work well. Problem is that batteries discharge spontaneously even though the switch is off.Therefore every time I turn on the switch, batterie level is empty state. The product seems to have an internal short-cicuit.I had been complainting this problem to the Archos service center by e-mail several times, but they had been ignoring me. I had no reply from Archos at all. So I recomend the one, who is going to buy a product of Archos by online, not to choose a Archos. You better choose a Nomad or a Rio that has same 20GB hard disk MP3 player."
1,If only there was a zero star for this piece of [junk],"I HATE IT SOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!! SO MUCH! It's such a worthless piece of junk. It worked great for about a month and I loved it then all it ever did was say HD Error and fry the thirty dollars worth of rechargable batteries i bought straight from Archos! Oh how I hate them and this product! I'm fourteen, i don't have a job it took me six months to save up for this, and now I'm just out of about 400$ The customer service is non existant! If I email them they tell me to call them, if I call them I get a menu loop. It's unfair. I'm just [out of luck] over, but lucky for you this happened to me first, so it DOESN'T have to happen to you. I know you hear about the ones that supposedly work but the wonderful people at Best Buy replaced mine three times even after their store warantee wore off, but they won't anymore. So I'm broke and I have a ugly looking paperweight."
4,excellent product,"This is a very good player. Some things I'm really liking:* Handles long filenames very well - it scrolls them back and forth in the display rather than cutting them off.* Linux recognized it - Debian (woody) recognized it as /dev/sda1, just plugged in the usb cable and mounted the drive.* Very good bass* Plugs into my car audio system* Comes with sample mp3's - I liked this because it meant I got to try it out right away* Has a built-in microphone - this means i can use it as a personal voice recorder and keep notes on it in .mp3 format"
3,Problems but Good for the Money,"After evaluating a number of different HD MP3 players, I settled on the Archos Jukebox Recorder with some trepidation based on previous reviews. I purchased a USB 2.0 card to give me extra ports to use with the Jukebox Recorder to take advantage of the abilty to upload music using USB 2.0. BIG MISTAKE. After downloading the USB drivers onto the computer, I could not get the device recognized on my computer using the USB 2.0 card ports, but could only get this recognized using the USB 1.1 installed ports on the computer. After getting through this problem (which took 3 hours and no help from Archos Tech Support) I found the player to work well. The headphones are junk and Archos should be ashamed to send them. But it is clearly worth the money in the amount of music stored on the device, ease of use of the menus, and ease of interfacing with the computer absent this 2.0 card problem."
1,Don't buy this machine!,"This is the worse electronic equipment I've ever purchased. Yes, it stores lots of files and you'll have a good portion of your CD collection on the tip of your fingers. But that is after you have spent a couple of days trying to figure out how to work the machine. You need to read the manual for little things like turning the machine ""off"" -- no joke! I can't wait to return it and get a different one."
1,Awful Case,"The case does not allow for full range of motion of opening the phone, and in addition to that the case does not allow for the camera shutter to be opened AT ALL. Do not purchase this product"
3,Fast Read,"Fast Read, not funny or it was it an assumption it would be do to his profession. Read it for a book club."
4,Hilarious!,"Not many books make me laugh out loud (particularly when I'm reading in bed at midnight), but this one did. Lots of fun British references that made me nostalgic for the year I lived in London. Definitly read!"
2,Really Lacking,"I had such high hopes for this fresh take on the male perspective. Mr. Commitment by Mike Gayle has been called the ""male Bridget Jones"" and, I was so hoping for that. But, I was really let down. I found this book boring, uninspired, and a big ole' bunch of nothing. I'm not really sure what the plot was, I didn't care about the characters. If you want a look into the mind of a man...check out ""Come Together"" by Josie Lloyd, Emlyn Rees. You'll find a deeper look into the mysterious world of a guy. This one will leave you feeling disappointed."
5,Perfect,Got it for my husband to set up in the house and he loves it. I would not reccomend it for a child because it will not hold out against place..it is JUST for looks :)
1,piece of junk,"Since the description on Amazon says nothing like this, we were surprised that the box the robot came in said ""not a toy! for display only"" or something like that. Since I'd bought it for my 3-year-old son, I was disappointed.I took the robot out of the box, gave it a single wind, attempted to adjust the arm just a bit, and the arm fell off. Impossible to put back on. Within 5 seconds of removing from a box, we had a broken toy.If you want to carefully display this and never really touch it, then buy it. Otherwise, run the other way. There's a reason this ""toy"" is so inexpensive."
3,Too particular,"I usually enjoy the Counterpoints series and Kenneth Gentry's writings quite a bit, but the points of view represented in this book were just too particular. My postmil friend was irritated that Gentry favored Reconstructionist postmillenialism, while I (being an amil preterist) was annoyed that the amillenialist presentation slighted preterism. I imagine premils will find certain segments also unrepresented.Though not a bad book, it's not quite what I would have hoped for a brief introduction to all three views."
2,"Good premise, but tedious execution","As usual, this Zubro mystery is well plotted. Also as usual, it is rather tediously written. It would seem the author was always instructed to give details, to carefully note the appearance of each character. What he comes up with is a detailed description of apparel for each character, from the top down: hair, shirt, trousers (or skirt), shoes. Colors, patterns, and fabrics are always noted. All very good, if or when these are noteworthy. But usually folks are wearing denim and cotton and etc., and giving these details imparts nothing to the reader.This is just a warning--I shall probably continue to read Zubro's books. But I only WISH he wrote a bit better!"
1,A Propagandistic diatribe.,I have this book. It is useful for exploring official Mormon racism circa 1960. The book reads like a white supremacist tract disguised as scholarship.
5,Outstanding,"In telling the amazing story of the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration, the author recounts her own search for faith. Her struggle and skepticism create a striking contrast that is moving and provocative. As someone who grew up in the church and drifted away, I often empathized with the author. It's as if I were experiencing her search firsthand."
3,Sharp TV - Quality of Picture and Delivery,"The quality of the screen (I'm using it as a TV) is not as good as my old 1987 bedroom TV. Other reviewers were pleased, maybe it works better connected to a PC? I've gone through the setup a number of times. Can't get a clear picture.It is compact and fits well on the counter top. Also, it was easy to setup.For delivery an appointment had to be scheduled so I had to come home from work for a 4 hour period to have this item delivered. This is the first time any service didn't deliver to my door and this item isn't more than usual orders."
5,The definitive history of UAL.,"This outstanding book is a must for anyone interested in the airline industry! Superbly written with fascinating detail and inside information, this book explains how United came to be and provides valuable insight into the forces that continue to shape modern day airlines."
3,New Venue for me,Just starting to explore mythology... this was recommended by a friend so need to reread a few times for true judgement
5,a classic,"What is there to say about Bulfinch's Mythology? The formatting is correct for the Kindle edition and it is the complete text. One note to specialists - he mentions the Greek names, but uses the Roman throughout."
2,Facinating subject,"It is a testament to the power that Great White Sharks hold over people that this book sells so well in spite of it's obvious failings. The treatment of the biology, ecology and behavior of the sharks is given short thrift, instead it's all about her obsessive desire to be with the action and to see one of the huge females (the Sisterhood) instead of the smaller 'mere' Rat Pack males. One gets the impression that her biggest regret at the end was not the fact that she caused Peter Pyle to lose his job, or did anything illegal, or nearly lost an expensive boat, but simply that she didn't see one of these bigger sharks. There are better books on sharks out there, and better books about scientists too."
4,A good read,"The author has a keen ability to bring you into story. A good sense of place and descriptions that lend a divorce from reality while reading. There were a few places that a bit of editing might have assisted, because it drags a little, but overall it is a fine book."
3,Fun read for a volunteer!,"I volunteer in the Sanctuary and have wanted to read this book for a while. It was a good, fun read. Interesting shark science and area history. I loved the map and figuring out where all the places were that she described. Not especially well-written but enjoyable. By the end of the book I was sick of the two researchers (very much ""guys"") and more than ready to get back to the mainland. I assume she was sleeping with one or both of them, since they risked their jobs to have her there and it was such a lonely, desolate place, but it was never mentioned."
2,A cure for insomnia,"The most boring book about sex that I have ever read. This book may have some helpful tips to spice up one's sex life, but I don't know what they are because I fall asleep each time I start to read it.Yawn."
2,"Fair in quality, and somewhat out-of-date","This is a fair, but not great book. There is a decent recounting of studies relevant to the topic of socialization of homeschoolers. For some reason, however, the last year covered is 1999, even though the book was published in 2004. I would guess that there have been more studies in the last ten years than the previous years, and that recent studies have been better designed on average. Also, the writing style is fine, but not great.I would say that if you could acquire this book used for a couple dollars or less, it might be worth acquiring if you want something to loan out to concerned friends/family. But, if you are willing to spend more than that, I would check outThe Well-Adjusted Child: The Social Benefits of Homeschooling, which I rate as 5 stars. Also, if you're looking for socialization information for your own reassurance, check out HSLDA; their information will be a lot more up-to-date, and free."
5,"If you are a fan, well worth it!","I would concur with the previous reviewer as to the quality and worthiness of this release. Prime 66-67 live Airplane! Very energetic and rockin'! The sound is not pristine by today's standards, but good for an archival disc of this sort. I wonder about the legitimacy of the release, however, since ""Come Back Baby"" is mistitled. I don't think the band would have approved that. It's available though, so if you love this group in their heyday, seek it out."
2,the band is great but the quaility is suck,"the performance of the band in this cd is very good,but the sound quality of this cd is bad,i would like to listen a better sound quality version......all songs seems came from one show,as all the sound quality are bad......"
2,REVISE THIS GAME!!!!,"My son got the game for the holidays, and really liked to play it until one part of the game. According to my 9 year old son, when you beat Peeves, he just stays where he is and keeps on trying to get you, and you're stuck in that part of the game. He thought it was so bad that he believed someone used a game shark on it when it was being made to mess up the game. He wanted me to tell everyone not to buy the game, unless they revise it."
3,Get GBC it's better,I got this game for Christmas and beat it with in days. I was shocked at the easiness of the game. I also own Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for GBC and that was really cool the graphics were bad but the story was awesome. It included things that the movie forgot and was a better game. U had better abilities and more of a challenge. This game was just simple a baby could beat it. I was expecting better because of GBA but I was very disappointed but it gave me a few hours of fun.
2,yikes,"i expected much, much more from this game. i thought that after harry potter and the sorceror's stone came out on gba, the makers would realize how horrible this game is. it starts off okay with a cute little intro to the game, but it just goes downhill from there. going up and down stairs is extremely difficult and quidditch is almost unbearable. there are many times when you have no clue what to do or where to go because there is no direction whatsoever. when i got this game, i expected a whole lot more. maybe the people who realeased this should have spent more time on creating a quality game instead of focusing on the quantity."
1,So aggravating!,It was really disappointed w/ it. You can't save unless you see a saving icon and the gringotts challenge is impossible. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to get really frustrated.
1,It is bad,"I didn't like this game because of the bad graphics, lousy sound, laughavle voices and frustrating game-play. Usually, game-adaptations, while not all that, mostly follow the story closely, and only because of that was I interested. Well see, that's the entire nature of the problem; it doesn't. Not once in the game did I recall an actual scene from the movie."
2,WAS cool for a while,"5/5 graphics. Good strategy game during boss fights. Minions are near impossible to kill, due to He-Man's only attack, which is way to slow. Buy this game cheaper, not worth 30 bucks."
3,Feels like an eternity,"The book covers the last 14 billion years or so, and sometimes it feels like it. It is a bit long-winded and certainly contains a lot of info that I doubt people really want to know. There are some compelling sections - like the U2 flights and the creating of COBE - but all in all Smoot repeats himself too much, and spends too much time on trivialities.A worthy read for those interested in cosmology, but not a stocking stuffer for the casual reader!"
5,Worth Reading,"This is definitely worth reading. It's short enough to be a quick, one-day read, or a reflective read -- at a few pages each night. It's something every Christian should read, just to familiarize ones-self with Brother Lawrence and his still-relevant conclusions about life after 40yrs of serving the Lord."
3,what it is,This is a Cd holder I'm writing this because a lot of people didn't know what it was now you all know.
2,What is this???????????????????,I think it's a coffee maker. You put an empty coffee cup in the round part and push down the top square part and it despenses coffee.
1,Should be worst class shoe polisher,"This is a piece of trash. The buffer ends are made of cheap plastic and the pads are so thin that it resembles a toy. When you put you shoe on it, the shoe bounces off of it. There is no way to make it buff smoothly over the shoe. You can't use any pressure or the spinning shuts down. After 10 minutes of use it shuts down because it gets to hot.Don't waste your time or money on this thing."
2,Cobra GPS not worth the price,"I purchased the Cobra GPS for my husband, and it won't even show the location of our new house. The elevation is different everytime we try to use it. It is difficult to use and doesn't tell you how to get somewhere. Use the money for a down payment on a different product."
2,very nice pump,"This is a very nice pump. Having the thermostat, timer and check valve all in one package really simplifies the installation. It's very quiet, consumes little power and does the job of bringing hot water to you instantly. One word of caution: this model requires additional items (brass union fittings) that must be purchased separately and are not cheap. A simpler solution is to buy the NPT or sweat model instead."
1,SUCKED!!!,read this book when it first came out can usually read a book in a few days. Oh my gosh terrible took for ever to get to the real deal DO NOT WASTE A PENNY ON THIS BOOK. HORRIBLE OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWW
1,TERRIBLE,"I just returned from Chile. This book was horrible. Maps were wrong. Prices, hours and addresses were way off. The section on the Torres Del Paine is absolutely worthless. I doubt their guide writer even went there. Buy the Lonely Planet guide instead. I ended up throwing the Lets Go away and borrowing a Lonely Planet guide from a fellow traveler."
4,"No rest for the bloody wicked, eh?","I really had fun watching this film. It is a horror-comedy of a higher standard. The movie varies from hilarious to grotesque. The comedy in this movie is derived from the killer being way over the top. Most you see coming, but some catches you off guard. The plot is very rarely on track, and this movie is VERY confusing. However, it gets 4 stars, because the death scenes in this are BRILLIANT on the budget the movie had.Cheeky comedy, mixed with horrific violence.Overall, a good buy."
5,I love it,"I was a bit worried about the reviews the mentioned how cheaply this is made. But mine was easy to assemble and install, it works and looks great, and I can see it on my back-up camera so if I back into something, that will be my own fault."
2,When it works its awesome,Bought this product a while ago and absolutly loved it... at first. I live in Washington and apparently this product is not made to stand up to the rain as after about 2 weeks it had standing water in it and shorted out. But while it did work it looked and functioned amazingly. If you live in a place where it rains however I would not reccomend this product.
5,Janet Baker brings a voluptuous sound to JS Bach canatas,"Listened to Baker conducted by Neville Marriner off and on for 10 days during WKCR's annual Bach festival, Dec. 21 -28. (KCR is Columbia U.'s college radio station.) She's as addictive as the music."
1,"Bad, don't buy it",Boring and cheesy. All the good reviews about this book are probably friends of this guy.
3,lid pops off,Its toothpaste. What can you say about a general run of the mill toothpaste? I prefer paste without fluoride and chemicals. Wont buy this again.
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I loved this so much! Susan is a really down to earth character, and Star is really great. Tara is a really 'perfect' snob for the story, too. I can't say how much I loved this heart-warming story!"
2,It won't stop leaking,"I just stated using this iron and I'm really disappointed. Ironing at the maximum setting with the iron real hot and using bottle water produced continuous and incredibly annoying dripping. The dripping still occurred with the steam off. Running the iron through the cleaning cycle didn't help either. The cleaning mechanism is pretty awkward as well, you have to hold a little lever for 1 minute in order to activate the cleaning cycle. If it wasn't for the dripping, it gets hot enough, glides nicely, and I could live being a little inconvenienced while cleaning it. I was expecting better quality from Rowenta, especially after all the positive reports."
4,Getting the job done,With this iron the job gets done without major effort and in an efficient way. The weight of the iron is perfect and the steam is well controlled. I am a very satisfied customer and is the second Rowenta iron that I own.
3,Good while it lasted,"I received this iron from my MIL for Christmas 2007. I had asked for a Rowenta that wasn't too heavy, since I have carpel tunnel. This iron worked good, but not great. I would have loved more steam. The iron died in January 2009, of course after the warranty period. To be fair, I do iron off and on for hours a day, six days a week, so if you added up the hours of use, it probably lasted a fair amount of time. However I have in the past used inexpensive irons that lasted far longer under the same conditions."
2,rowenta iron,I was disappointed to find a made in china label on this product.Could Amazon include this in the product information before purchase?The temperature control is difficult to turn.
1,Not worth the price and Rowenta name,"I've always used Rowenta steam irons but since they are manufactured in China the quality has decreased significantly. I've purchased the DX1700 in November 2009, it's now out of warranty andtoday the light on the left side of the iron started flickering, the iron is making noise and a burning smell is coming from the inside of the iron. I'm sure some wires are starting to burn out and it is now a fire hazard. The iron has been in use on rare occasions and still looks like new - it's not worth the price. Never again Rowenta."
1,fire hazard,"Purchased this from retail store 2 years ago for use in my winter home. Total months used 9. A week ago I noticed when plugged in the iron took a while to heat up then last night where the cord meets the base I heard a sizzle, saw a spark followed by a puff of smoke! Went online this am to research Rowenta problems/recalls and realized I was fortunate the iron did not burst into flames or explode. There is a limited 1 year warranty so I am out of luck. I would NOT suggest buying this iron or any Rowenta iron based on my experience and online horror stories concerning other Rowenta models"
2,rowenta iron,"the iron arrived in time and in perfect condition. but i have not been happy with it; the cord is super short, the rubber guard next to the iron catches and is not stable. i wish i had stuck with my usual choice of cheaper iron."
1,Over Rated - Leaks,This iron cuts on and off after 10 seconds of non-use. It leaks at times. I sent this iron back to the manufacturer and they sent me a new one. The new one did the same as the first three months later. Over rated for the high price of this iron.
1,don't waste your money,"On ""dry"" setting, iron continues to send out bursts of water, which can ruin some fabrics. Takes a long time to heat up and then doesn't maintain heat setting. One of the worse irons I've ever bought. Only good thing I can say about it is the retractable cord."
1,precisionsteam iron,"Never buy a REWENTA product. I have it for less than 3 years and I use it rarely. The non stick bottom sticks, the steam does not work and the ironing became lousy. Customer service is pathetic. I would rather buy a $20.00 iron and change it every couple of years than this expensive one. It was over $60.00."
2,Not worth the money,"I switched to a Rowenta from a cheapo brand a couple of years ago. This iron worked great for a while but now about 2 years later, just stopped turning on. I read other reviews and have found that this is a fairly common occurence. Very disappointed as I was expecting to get more time out of this iron given the fact that my Mother uses a Rowenta and loves it! Maybe she has a different model but this was very disappointing.Not worth it the money."
1,disappointed,"My iron is only about 2 years old. It has always leaked a little. That became progressively worse-until the last few weeks. The water started flowing out of the handle area if I filled it even close to the top. Mine also started shutting off on its own after a few months of use. Finally, it completely stopped working a couple of days ago. The iron looks brand new-like I never even used it! I'll never buy another Rowenta."
1,USED IRON SOLD AS NEW!,I was very upset to receive an iron that had water in it. The sole plate had hard water stains in the vent holes. The entire iron had sticky stuff all over.I could not believe Amazon would try to pass off a used iron for new. I did contact Amazon and the iron was replaced.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IRON,"I've never taken the time to write a review about a product ever. But I felt a duty to my fellow citizens to warn you about this iron. In short - DO NOT BUY THIS IRON. Not only is it the worst iron I've ever used, it's the worst product I've ever used.This iron stays on for maybe 10-15 seconds, then it shuts off and the light flashes red.The instuctions actually warn you this will happen. The solution. ""Shake it"". Shake it?! Are you kidding me? That's like saying you should fix your TV by kicking it. But the worse part, even when you shake it, it does not come back on. And when you shake it, water flies everywhere. I could go on and on with even more details about how aweful this product is but I do not want the makers of this aweful product to waste any more of my time than they already have with this iron. So, regardless of what any other reviews say, move on to another iron. Take this one off your maybe list. Do not buy this iron."
2,Don't buy this iron,"I have had the Rowenta DX1700 Effective iron for just over two years. This iron was amazing for the first year, heats up quickly, gets wrinkles out effortlessly, the steam feature worked great and it works with tap water. About a year later it started leaking and shortly after that it would turn off and cool down while the iron was in use. I take really good care of my things even so this iron quit working and started leaking after only a year of careful use. DON'T buy this iron! There's a good iron out there its just not the Rowenta DX1700 iron."
4,yoga nidra,"i think this is a good honest relaxation tape,it takes a long time from start to finish and if you are feeling a bit sleepy anyway its easy to nod off! I did start to find the breathing part of the tape a bit tedious. I started by doing it every daybut now i do it only twice a week,depending on my mind set sometimes it has more effect than others. I am not good at being told what to do but this guy is not too authoritarian, his voice is calm and there only to help focus you. I very much like that there is no tinkerly music in the background.!!"
1,Not my cup o tea,"I have been meditating for over 15 years. I did not particularly like this meditation. Way too much talk, difficult to follow, instructions too quick. . Definately not for the novice. Just my 2 cents"
3,Yoga Nidra Meditation CD: Extreme Relaxation of Conscious Deep Sleep,"The content was good, but the sound quality was bad. It sounded like a CD that was copied from an overplayed tape that lost the clarity of the original. One had to work hard at listening to get the benefit of the CD.The item was delivered timely."
4,Worked for me!,"I had only taken 2 yoga classes and listened to one other relaxation cd before buying this. I am not a friend of the author. I had jetlag from an 11 hour flight and couldn't relax to sleep. I gave my undevoted attention to this CD start to finish wearing noise reduction headphones. I did not fall asleep during the meditation like some reviewers. I DID completely relax, clear my mind of distraction, refresh my body, and experience a physical release of tension that let me fall into sleep 15 minutes later. NO LIE! Be a good listener with desire to learn and you will get something from this meditation."
2,Too bad I didn't read the user reviews first,"Like some others, I was expecting a high-def concert, with the soloist and orchestra featured in the video. To my surprise, I got what amounts to a cd with still landscape photos. Furthermore, my rather sophisticated sound system has so far only been able to elicit 2-channel stereo out of this disc. I already had half a dozen versions of Rachmaninov's Piano Concertos 2&3, and didn't need another. Likely my Vivaldi purchase will be the same. The product description should be up-front about the nature of this ""HD DVD"", which is little more than a cd."
3,Great Playstation 1 Game,One of my favorite Playstation 1 games. I still appreciate my PS 1 despite having a PS 2 and PS 3.
4,open the Magic in Your Heart,This game was great.And still is i get stuck on some parts but manage to get through.Nothing is reallly hard .It is way better then the 1st game.So i recomend u buy this game as fast as possible!!
4,Like being in a sonic war zone!,"The latest release by ""Alien"" Jourgensen starts exactly where the last CD, Houses of the Mole, left off. The only difference is that while Houses was a soundtrack to unrelenting antagoniziation of the George W. Bush regime, this one is the soundscape to an all-out war against him. Jourgensen has never been shy of his mistrust and utter hatred for the policies of the Bush politicians. On the Ministry essential, Psalm 69, he went after Bush Sr. with utter ferocity. However, that was nothing compared to the all out bashing that Bush Jr. gets on Rio Grande Blood. The beats are like rounds being fired at the highest velocity possible, while the guitar riffs (many courtesy of Tommy V of Prong) drop like explostive bombs throughout the album. Very fast, very pulse pounding, very sarcastic, and definitely not for people that voted for Bush. Really, the album cover says it all!"
2,Cindy Sheehan's Favorite CD,"I'm not a hardcore Ministry fan, but I have enjoyed a few of their CD's from the past. Sometimes I need to hear something with heavy industrial edge to it, and Ministry does it.I got this CD and I like the music to it. The lyrics however, ruin the album for me. I respect people's political opinions whether I agree with them or not. But this is kind of absurd. Even if I hated Bush, I would still find this type of propaganda annoying, especially in a band that I like to listen to. I'm not a Bush hater, but I'm not a Bush lover either, thats for sure.If you can get past the propaganda lyrics, then its not too bad. The music itself is heavy as hell. I suggest previewing tracks before buying. I would rate the music part of it at 5, but its not enjoyable due to the lyrics. I assume if you dont agree to this review you are a hardcore liberal with no open mind."
2,"Al is musical genius, however....","I have a number of Ministry's earlier albums, the last album I purchased was ""A Mind is a Terrible to Taste."" Then over the years my occupation and family absorbed most of my time, I stopped going to clubs (and I never watched MTV) so I stopped keeping track of a lot of my favorite bands.A friend convinced me to check out the 6/22/06 Ministry/Revolting Cocks concert at Harpos (Detroit). The music (without lyrics) was awesome and mesmerizing. Al is a musical genius. However, I was greatly disappointed in the relentless anti-bush, anti-military, anti-war, leftist message being steady rammed down my throat via imagry onscreen and lyrics. My reaction was visceral, but I forced myself to remain until after NWO was performed then I split. I do not share the politics of the left, and I will leave it at that. It is a free country.I will never attend another Ministry concert again in my lifetime, I will never patronize their cd's."
3,Paarfi jumps the shark,"I've been a devoted fan of Brust's work since about 1984, and I loved the first two Khaavren romances (The Phoenix Guards, and 500 Years After). But this volume stretches the Paarfi-device too thin, because so *little* actually happens in the plot. As another reviewer pointed out, this story could have been charmingly told by Brust in 50 pages. Even Brust-as-Paarfi could have told it in 200 pages! But in fact, Paarfi tells this story in about 400 pages. The diversions and circumlocutions that were so enjoyable in previous volumes have overwhelmed the story. There's too much filler, too much padding.A cooking metaphor might resonate with Brust and his readers. Suppose a novel were a bowl of Hungarian goulash. In previous volumes, Paarfi's style was like a generous measure of paprika; it colored the whole dish, and added a layer of depth and flavor. But in *this* volume, the chef seems to have dumped a pound of paprika into a single bowl of goulash. What would Mr. Valabar say?"
1,DM Cookbook CD ROM,"Book is OK, but DON'T BUY THE CD-ROM! I dropped [a large amount] for what I thought would be a worth-while ""self-learning"" course on Data Mining programming in SAS. To my great disappointment, I found that while Olivia had included the code (which you can type in yourself), there was NO DATA PROVIDED, making the code all but useless (can't run the models with no data!). I e-mailed her asking for some kind of a sample data set. She agreed, but after months of begging she provided nothing whatsoever. Don't make the same mistake I did - STAY AWAY FROM THE CD-ROM!!!"
5,I've been looking for a book like this for years!,"Finally, a book that thoroughly explains predictive and descriptive modeling in simple language. It discusses the importance of defining the objective as well as using quality data. Parr-Rud uses real world examples to detail methods for building response, risk, churn, and lifetime value models. She even includes several validation techniques that are not available in most packaged solutions. A very accessible book."
4,Important but repetetive message,There is little for me to add to the other fine reader reviews of this work except to say that I found it very repetitive. I am not sure that it could not have been a long article in the Atlantic or Harper's.I am not at all sure that there is much that can be done to preserve some of these minor languages in the long run but I do find it admirable that the authors have taken up the cudgel.
1,Poor Attempt,I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important. They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct. They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense. This book is not even worth being picked up.
5,"""The Hardest Work"" made fun!","The poet Rilke said that love is the hardest work there is. Unlike so many dry, or ethereal books on the subject,Jaci makes attracting and sharing love fun! Not only is her book fun however, it alos provide practical healing guides for one of the day's greatest wounds, the wound of lonliness.John Becker, PhD Psychologist and PsychotherapistSinglesandSoulmates.com"
4,Great to start with,"I read this book after reading the Foxfire book on blacksmithing in my quest to learn more. Bealer goes into great detail about techniques and tools of the trade. I would recomend this book to anybody interested in taking up blacksmithing as a hobby. A word of caution is in order here though; no book can teach you all of this skill. I would recomend, in addition to reading this book, locating a smith or a college with a blacksmithing course near you and talking to them to really learn the trade. That being said, this book is a great and accurate introduction to the art. This book is economical enough that even if you don't pursue blacksmithing as a hobby, you won't be out too much and will still have all of that wonderful knowledge."
5,"""Best Ever Civil War Account""",This book is a masterpiece. It is put in a great order and makes you feel like you're a part of this historic battle. I would recommend this to any history buff or someone who likes to read true history stories.
4,Excellent But,"I picked up the lotion at a store then found it cheaper at Amazon. However, the thick lotion I had bought before now was thin and it separated, like it had been frozen or left in a heated place. I am leary about ordering it again from Amazon and I will have to go back to my local store which is not convient for me to get to. If Amazon fixes the problem I will order again.I"
3,Great deal but not true to size,"The band fitting was okay for me but the size wasn't...as said by others, when ordering this piece, it should be half a size smaller than our usualsize. I'm a 7, hence should have bought a 6.5 instead."
5,"A dramatic and moving saga, highly recommended","Starring Academy Award winning actress Marcia Gay Harden in the role of Inga, Home: A Film by Mary Haverstick follows Inga, a mother with the soul of a poet at a crossroads. Her estranged husband Hermann (played by Michael Gaston) is bereft of emotional support for her in the wake of her recovery from breast cancer, let alone her passion for buying and restoring and house that reminds her of her childhood home. She shares a close bond with her eight-year-old daughter, and though she is troubled by her decaying marriage, she retains a strong spirit of optimism, as expressed in her own writing. A dramatic and moving saga, highly recommended; bonus features include deleted scenes, storyboards, and poems. 84 minutes."
