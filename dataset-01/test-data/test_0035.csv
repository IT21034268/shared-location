2,depressing,"This book was depressing-nothing light about it-the style of writing is different and visual but if you are in it for a story, it is a tough read."
2,Hmmm... I'm not impressed,"Well, I don't know what defines 'masterpiece,' but I didn't find anything particularly ingenius about this book. Nothing against the author, but, why does this child come back for Love? How lame... Wouldn't the average murdered child ghost come back for bloody revenge? I'll stick to my Tolkien and Crichton."
1,A CONTINUATION OF A STORY OF MYSELF,"....I used the book as a project for my high school multiculturalproject, and I expcted more out of such a hyped up and widely praised book. There haven't been many books that I've actually enjoyed, and this is definitely a book that I really did not enjoy. I would credit the sucess of this book to Oprah.... The only reason why I gave this book 1 star was that it was so pathetic I actually felt sorry for it."
4,Beloved was a moving and touching novel. Superb.,"The novel, Beloved, gave me a greater understanding of the inhumane treatment of the slaves during the 19th century and the hardships they endured after the war. Of all the characters in the novel, my favorite was Baby Suggs. She had a grasp on reality and wisdom which she shared with those in need. The character of Paul D. also struck a chord with me. All in all, this novel was delightful and a pleasure to read. It was a great contribution to American literature."
4,A compelling novel of sheer talent!,"As a scholar of English Literature, I was compelled to read a nobel prize winner such as Morrison. It was an outstanding piece of work and I am sure that it will be admired for many years to come. Recently I was priviliged to experience one of her lectures in Lausanne, Switzerland and it was very intreeging learning how she perceives her work, and how different it was to the sheer amount of critics who are unable to crawl into her complex recipe of thought and excellence. Beloved is, however a novel, for a reader willing to spend alot of time annalysing the deapth of her historical research and experience. It's a classic!"
1,Shockingly overrated.,"Beloved has been garnering accolades from so many critics - this reader has only one question : why? There is nothing exceptional about Beloved. It is pretentious, self-righteous, and sanctimonious. The characters are amazingly one-dimensional, and the self-congratulatory structure makes it almost painfully difficult to read. From a thematic point of view, it explores almost nothing new and lacks originality. Overall, an irritating novel which doesn't deserve a single measure of the superfluous praise it has received."
3,"Forget the plot, enjoy the writing","Beloved is an absolutely beautiful book...once you make the conscious decision that the plot is impossible to resolve, and stop trying to do so. This can be discomforting, since plot is the vehicle that takes us from one place to another, and since being lost is an inherent human fear. However, do not let the unknown destination deter you from a long, lovely drive."
3,Confusing Love,"Actually, I gave the book 3.5 stars because there were good points to this book. 'Beloved' is very confusing to read as it jumps around, however, it draws the reader in and is compelling. As the book slowly describes everyone, each situation merges with each other opening way for an epic novel.Tantilizing and scary are ways to describe Morrison's intriguing outlook on the lives of slaves. It would have been nicer if not so many stories were twisted into one. When I read, I prefer to drift into a netherworld, not think about what I am reading.This book is good but not spectacular like so many people think. 'Beloved' is a much better read than viewing of the film disaster, however."
3,Must read more than once!,"Well, where do I start? I thought the book BELOVED was rather confusing. It was very difficult for me to grasp certain parts of it. And it was not something that I wanted to read in the first place. Which made it less appealing while reading. The book did not keep my intrest, wanting to read more because there were times when I would be reading and I would fall asleep. If you are going to read this book you'll need patience to better understand what is happening, I would say that you have to want to read it in order to enjoy it. And it would probably help if you read it more than once."
3,Not a Book about Slavery,"Toni Morrison's Beloved is not her best book, but one in which she covers themes and a time period she hasn't written about before. Contrary to some , Beloved is not a novel about the institution of slavery. This is a novel about a woman and her family and the lengths she went through to make sure her children did not endure the horrors she did. This novel is also a bit of a ghost story which brings the supernatural theme into play. I think that Morrison's portrayal of the ghost Beloved was top-notch, making me wonder throughout the novel whether or not Beloved was really real. Although not one of Morrison's best novels, it is a terrifically written, thoroughly enjoyable novel based on a real-life person."
2,Confused,"This book has made me realize that either I am not quite literate enough or I do not have a mature enough appreciation or respect for great literature yet. Especially after the whole hype on this book because of the movie, I thought it would be great to read, however, I found it to be very difficult to read. Overall, I think that this book will only be appreciated, if it is read a couple times. I guess for you to appreciate this novel, you would have to really understand the time, setting, and circumstances that the characters in the novel at that time were faced with."
3,#10 ----Journal,I thought this book was fairly decent.Although it was confusing at times.It certainly is not my type of book. The story itself is very good but I would not recommend this to my friends or anyone else. Maybe when I get older I will appreciate this book a little more but for now I would say this book should be read by the older generation. It really isn't aimed towards younger folks. That is probably why the majority think of this book as confusing. I just would not go to a bookstore and buy this book. Other than that I would say this is a fairly decent book aimed at ages 25 and up. Try it out. You may like it.
3,This book was somewhat of a disappointment.,"I began reading this book thinking surely a Nobel Prize winner must be great, and ended up wondering if I'd missed something along the way. Though the general theme of the book became clear about midway, most of the fact presentations were disjointed and unclear. When the author switches to a little bit of what might be considered poetry, towards the end of the book, the reader is tossed into confusion. The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages. I wouldn't recommend this book too highly to anyone, and as far as Oprah's recommendations, I haven't yet found one worth it's salt."
2,"Not engrossing, not entertaining, not enlightening",I did not enjoy this book. Try The Color Purple instead.
1,This won a Nobel Prize?,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't get past the first chapter. It was dull, hard to understand and the characters were making no impressions on me. How does a book like this win such a great prize? Yes, Toni Morrison is a great author but really, why this book?"
1,Watch out,"This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem. If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality, try Clarivue."
2,"Learn a lot, pure frustration","The color theory behind this game/toy is great and one can learn a lot thru figuring out the layout and setting it up, but putting it together takes the fun out of it. It is pure frustration. Putting the little cubes together and trying to get them on the rods and twisting the cubes into place without keeping the rest in place is almost impossible.Unfortunately, I would not recommend it to anyone but a masochist."
3,Eh. Pretty but not worth the $$.,"Wacoal bras are lovely, it's true. And I owned one of this model for several years. The wire didn't break through the material, the lace didn't tear, and the bra generally held its shape. However, the silky material of the straps frayed and tore, despite all my efforts to treat the bra nicely and gently.Because the bra cost $60, I repaired it as best I could and held onto it for a long time - nearly four years - until it started to lose its support.But it had been a problem from about the first six months.I'll go with a nice Bali Satin Tracings bra - retails for 50 - 65% less and holds up for a loooong time. Not as fancy, maybe, but I need the support more than I need the floofy parts."
4,Great bra,"The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is that the straps aren't padded. Otherwise, this is a great minimizer. Especially nice for women who wear a small band size. It's pretty and isn't bulky."
4,Almost Perfect,"The book is everything I thought it would be and more! I bought the item new, however the book cover did have a scratch on it. This was disappointing as when buying something ""new"" you want it to be perfect. Other than that it was. Thank you."
5,Furniture: World Styles from Classical to contemporary,"A professional Interior Designer of 22 years, I also teach Interior Design at the University level. I am proud to require this as our textbook for History of Furniture. The photography, the selected pieces, the detailed information --- on-target! Students actually enjoy learning historical styles, all-the-while picking-up a little World History along the way. (Warms a teacher's heart!)The book contains elegant photos of furniture only found in world famous museums. Judith Miller has given us an up-close and personal look at seldom seen antiques, as well as more current pieces. Even the dedicated student would have had to spend years visiting select museums for just a peek. The quality of the research, the pictures, even the quality of the paper tells the reader ""something special is behind this cover"".All this AND, it's a gorgeous Coffee Table Book; worthy of a Christmas gift to that hard-to-buy-for person on everyone's list."
4,He's no Sean Connery but...,"Lazenby doesn't give off that suave tough guy attitude that Connery does but this in my opinion is still a great movie. It has one of the more original plots (not nuculear warfare), Rigg does a great job as the Bond girl, and OHMSS has by far the best Blofeld. Don't write it off because you like the other Bonds better give it a chance."
5,Splendid,"Many thinks that this one is the worst because of the presence of George Lazenby. But actually it's one of the strongest to date.Lazenby is no Connery or Dalton, but he's adequate in the role of 007.Former editor of Dr No to Thunderball, and second-unit director of You only live twice, Peter R Hunt makes an impressive start as director (unfortunly he never did any more Bond).Together with a screenplay by Richard Maibaum (based on Fleming's novel), Syd Cain's production design, Photography by Michael Reed, editing of John Glen and of course John Barry's excellent score, you'll have a film that collects all the best elements of Bond, James Bond."
3,fine.,"this was free on amazon movie hook up.its fine.nothing special.if i was a full on james bond freak im sure id love it.im not though.i mean im diggin me a james bond movie, but im not all about it..if its free its for me.including this."
2,One of the Worst,"And I thought Moonreaker was bad. God. Geroge Lazenby sucks. He's a disgrace to the Bond films. Sean Connery would have made this movie a thousand times bettter.Second, I never really got the plot. Blofeld is pretending to work at an allergy clinic? That's just plain stupid. Blofeld's actor was horrible too. The plot really never picked up until the end. The ski chase was cool. The bobsled thing was cool too, but Blofeld won't die.The girls were ugly too. And I keep wanting Blofeld to act like Dr. Evil.I'm starting to read the book. Frankly, I'd rather watch a movie than read a book. But, this is just a disgrace to Ian Fleming. Good thing he didn't live to see this. He would have died after he watched it anyway.The bottom line is: This movie is the worst Bond film. Avoid it. Try watching something like Goldeneye or Goldfinger."
1,This movie brings shame to the James Bond movies!!!!,"From bad acting, to bad music, to bad camera, to bad story, this is the badest film in the line, and also one of the worst movies ever made. It's so bad, it makes Dunes look like a good movie. George Lazenby is untastefuly casted to play James Bond. The fact that he didn't seem to be British was bad enough, but the way he was written made it even worse. If you are a true James Bond fan, you wont like this one. stay away from it."
2,Perfect except for one thing...,"Lazenby is awful. His imitation of Sean Connery just doesn't work. He's like a cardboard cut out being pushed through the movie. He is neither suave or dangerous His vapid grin annoys and his eyes betray that as an actor he didn't have any idea how to create an inner life for his character. I believe folks who rate this one highly are being too kind, reaching for what it might have been with a better Bond. Even Roger would have been an improvement.If you want a better more serious Bond go see Skyfall."
3,I miss the production quality of the previous Bonds,"This Bond plot has the potential to have a great villain, action sequences, and wonderful scenery, but there is something missing. It has that ""realistic"" production style that crept out of the '60's and dominated the '70's, and you didn't have to see that in the previous Bonds, and which made the previous Bonds more a joy to watch. The ""realistic"" look is OK for a film like the French Connection, the Godfather or a war picture, but it doesn't belong in a Bond picture. It's probably the director's fault, because the same production company made this one as the previous 5, so you can't blame EON productions."
1,Terrible Bond movie,"This has to be the worst Bond of them all! (The only reason I even have it is because I got the complete Bond set and apparently you can no longer get them individually).Here's an example of how bad and unbeleavable the story is:in one instance, he's seducing numerous patients at Blowfelds clinic, the next we're supposed to believe he's in love with Tracey? Give me a break."
1,You're better of with the VHS than the DVD,"I've been renting a lot of these Bond movies marked ""special edition"" and I've been running into glitches on more than half of them that make them unplayable. I think the studio ought to sever their contract with whatever burn plant they're using. Apparently the 21st century is not a good time to rent or buy a classic Bond flick on disc."
1,On Her Majest's service( Special Deition),I DID'NT REALIZE THAT THIS WAS NOT A SEAN CONNERY MOVIE WHENI ORDERED IT. VERY BORING AND NOT UP TO 007 STANDARDS
2,Mostly disappointed,"I've made 3 or 4 recipes from this book now - the only one that turned out was the caramelized onions, which were wonderful, but how could one screw that up? I had thought that perhaps my idea of what tastes good was just different from the author's, but after reading some of the other reviews here I see it's not just me.My expectations aren't usually all that high for crock-pot books, but Lora Brody has such a good reputation that I was expecting more than usual. I even tried one recipe twice thinking I must have made a mistake - it was worse the second time. Oh well.I was disappointed enough to be inspired to write my first-ever Amazon book review. I guess that's something!"
2,"smells like soap, not rain.",not at all what i expected. maybe the ones with the blue tips would be more what i'm looking for. these are not good.
5,WANT TO REALLY GET TO KNOW YOURSELF?,"THE BEST SELF-AWARENESS JOURNEY EVER!NO ONE CAN REMIND YOU ABOUT YOURSELF MORE THAN YOU CANBUY IT , USE IT , LIVE IT!"
2,Didn't fit,Will be returning these shoes after the holiday season. They are a very narrow fit and they do not stretch.
2,Not very well written or helpful,"This book confronts the reality that a difficult childbirth can impact a woman but it fails to help in any other way. The author focuses too much on the specifics of the difficult births featured in the book without doing a good job of looking at the bigger goal of helping any woman who had a difficult childbirth overcome the experience. I found it too hard to relate to the women featured - everyone's experience is different, even traumatic experiences. A better approach would be to take the focus off personal stories as anyone reading this book likely has replayed her own traumatic experience over and over and is seeking to overcome it rather than read a play by play of yet another bad time giving birth. I think a book about common reactions to a difficult delivery (such as anxiety) and how to deal with them would be more helpful."
1,The Last Temptation by Val McDermid,It must have been the wrong choice of Val McDermid's work. I must agree with one star reviews.The characters must have just landed from the moon and Special Ops guys use Swiss army knives.With McDermid's grasp of the world I have no more temptation to read her despite Mikael Blomquist (Stieg Larsson's character)read her books.
2,Far-fetched. . .,"The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic.Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias. Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to ""reveal"" the main undercover operation to the criminal. The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane. I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up. This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised.I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga. I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not."
3,It's okay,It's okay if you already like Tony and Carol from the TV show. There's not much to draw you in if not.
3,Reads more like a stand-alone,"This book didn't need to be about Carol Jordan and Tony Hill. They could have been replaced with any number of new characters created to fit a story that just didn't suit Carol and Tony well. Both the undercover and serial killer storylines were ill-suited to one another as the protagonists that populated them. It's not a bad book in a traditional sense, it's just a bad book for Carol and Tony."
3,"Average Thriller, At Best","I didn't find much in this book to recommend it. I thought the plot(s) unrealistic and the ending(s) silly. The book revolves around three lady cops and a male profiler -- based in England, Holland and Gemany -- all collaborating to bring down a crime organization and a serial killer, while they're at it. Just not very realistic. I must admit, the book kept me raptly reading, but by the time I got to the end, I felt it wasn't all that great a book."
3,Not the same color,"I bought this for my daughters nursery and I have to say I was a little disappointed. The pillow, the wall hangings, bumper, and quilt are made of fleece but you cant tell it from the picture. I'm not too crazy about fleece because it just seems like it gets dirtier easier. The picture frame and lamp are more of a peach color. And the crib sheet is a lighter pink than any of the other items. Its pretty but I just wasnt expecting the color and material that I got because in the picture it looks like everything is the same but its not. Next time I think I'm going to go to a store and actually pick out bedroom sets."
1,Bad purchase,"I ordered this book on the cheap , used good or used like new, What I received was a book club edition from the late 60's, early 70's. Many pictures were black and white . The color pictures were out of focus and very faded. I complained and my money was refunded. I put the book in recycling. I have no idea if current editions are updated. I would avoid."
1,a sad remake leave prince's stuff alone,prince does'nt let just anybody remake his stuff and after hearing this I can see why.
4,Very nice quality case with just a few issues.,"I bought one of these cases to take with me to shows, and after I received it, I bought a second one. It seems to be a nice quality case with just a couple of issues. The hinge was loose on one of the cases, which was no big deal. My husband fixed it fairly easily. The other issue was that there is no liner in them, and since this is a larger case than a standard jewelry showcase, the velvet inserts that are on Amazon are too small. I considered buying velvet and making my own liner, but I ended up using a cloth carpet material, cutting it to fit, and using glue to secure it to the bottom. It doesn't look all that great, and it would be better if they offered a velvet insert on Amazon to buy with this case. It is neat though that it is actually two cases in one, and I like that it secures with a lock."
4,80 Point Increase,"I used this workbook, along with the Kaplan verbal flashcards and the 2007 Kaplan Premier edition. I took the GRE 3 years ago without studying. I took it again this year, and using these materials, I increased my verbal score by 80 points (540 to 620!). The flashcards were the most helpful, as several of the words I learned showed up on the test. Study a lot, and you will do well."
1,decieving description,This is not an easy up unit it has to be put together every time.Putting the top on takes at least 2 people 10 minutes.The pictures show the top on the frame which is not the case. This same unit can be bought at Kmart or Target for half the money. If you are lokking for an easy up shade house look elsewhere.
2,Good while it lasted,"This item was good while it worked... We bought it for camping, as a bug-free dining room. The setup wasn't too hard, but you do need two people to set it up. I also thought the roof material was attached to the frame as it showed in the description, but no such luck. However... we set this screenhouse up on our back deck for use at a cookout. Fortunately the rain came after the party was over. We had the guy lines staked out off of the deck, pulling the roof taught so any rain would run off, but it didn't. It stretched the roof material into these little pockets which hung down inside of the frame and the whole frame collapsed. I'm fortunate that noone was in it at the time. It is bent and mangled beyond and repair. I have contacted the company, but based on other reviews, I don't expect much help from their customer service. I won't buy this again."
5,Tears it up!,"Was very pleased with the speed of delivery. I couldn't find this item anywhere locally. I guess no one de-thatched their lawn here in Florida. Antway, the product worked great. I ised it about 1.5 weeksago and the lawn is greening up nicely. I expect in two weeks in will be where I want it to be. Thanks for mking this product available to me......"
2,Not what its worked up to be,"I went out and got the CD on the first day it released after hearing So Sick and Stay- he knew which songs to release first. I am not happy I did. I am not feeling the CD at all. The radio keeps saying that it is hot and everyday I listen to it to see what I missed. I repeat Stay all the time as the other songs are not that great. I can tell which song he wrote for Mary because it is the same track as hers. Mirror is ok but the CD is not good. I would rather listen to my Marques Houston CD at least I like 4-5 songs on that CD. Like Chris Brown, this was a waste of money... Get the bootleg!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"This CD is just whatever. I wasn't really too impressed with it. Ne Yo can carry a tune, but he has no range and all of his songs sound the same. Maybe if there were real instruments being played instead of beat machines and synthesizers I'd be a little more interested. Anyway, this CD was boring and it was hard for me to listen to. Ne-Yo needs to stick to writing songs for other people. Skip this."
5,EXCEPTIONAL MUSIC THERAPY,"NEYO IS TO BE COMMENDED ON HIS EXEMPLARY MUSIC STYLE!! I LOVE HIS NEW ALBUM WHICH IS ""TASTEFULLY WRITTEN"".(SMILE) THANK YOU NEYO FOR GRACING US WITH YOUR GREAT STYLE OF MUSIC BECAUSE ""YOU MAKE ME BETTER""(SMILE).PEACE AND LOVE TO ALL,MONESHIA PERKINSFRESNO,CALIFORNIA"
5,THe Old Man's Boy Grows Older,Very nice old classic book. Received from bookseller promptly in very good condition as decribed.
2,"Great book, bad description","This book is a great read for any outdoorsman or anyone who has spent time with family in the outdoors. I have already read the first book ""The Old Man and the Boy"" and it was also great, I am only half way through this one but have not been disappointed yet. My only complaint is that the sellers description clearly stated unmarked and upon opening it to read I discovered that this book was in fact heavily marked as if by a child using it for a book report. There were brackets and side notes written on almost half of the pages. All I really wanted was to read the book but these do make it a little distracting sometimes, and it would have been nice to have a good copy to hold on to."
3,Blah.,"The older Tanner books were a blast to read. Had me laughing out loud. Tanner'sthe man."" This book has no zest, no fun, no laughs. But, it does have the blahs. Very much a disappointment."
4,Dahood's Risk,"I would like to temper Olaf01 statements about Dahood's well known work. Dahood does work deeply into Semetic philology, and while this may bog down the non-academics, he offers an incredible wealth of wisdom from this perspective. Often I was simply struck by the depth of his variant translations and readings of individual Psalms. For me, this is a strong resource to use along side of many other quality texts as mentioned by Olaf01. Dahood's takes some great risks opening himself up for brilliance or criticism. Either way, it makes for exciting and insightful comparisons among the other seminal texts."
2,not durable,"I purchased this product for my husband's birthday. Unfortunately, he only had it 2 days before an accident occurred in which the belt clip slipped from his belt and the player fell about 2 feet to our tile floor. This 1 fall seems to have wrecked the player. I might have done better to purchase a $300 brick. I am currently researching methods of somehow rescuing the player without paying the exhorbitant repair fees charged by Creative (since the warranty doesn't cover anything that isn't Creative's ""fault""--as if poor durability isn't their fault).I have heard that the I-pod can sustain several falls without severe problems, and if I had known of the Zen's poor durability before my purchase, I would have bought the I-pod instead. So: head's up if you're considering this purchase."
1,Unreliable player or just my bad luck,"Bought three (3) Zen Touch for Christmas 2004 (just a bit over one year ago). The disk drive one on went bad less than two months later. Creative Lab replaced it with a refurbished unit -- I hated that but had no choice.Now just one week after the one year part warranty hads expired, disk drive on another one went bad!!! It will cost $24.95 for diagnotics + parts to fix the player.It could be bad luck, but this is a rather disappointed experience for me (66% failure rate), so I think it would be fair to warn you all."
2,Ugh,"I read this series out of respect for his Marvel Comics work (was big into comic books at the time). And Lord, I mean Lord, did I regret it. The dialogue especially left deep emotional scars."
3,Handle these with kid gloves,"I have owned two pairs of these headphones and the sound is superlative. However, I would like them to last more than a year. Both pairs suddenly died on me, the most recent today (I'm shopping around Amazon for a new pair and thought I'd review what I had).The headphones do everything the manufacturer says they do. Outside sound is all but nonexistant while wearing these...a real marvel. The sound bears mentioning again. It's that extaordinary. Very natural sounding.Two pairs dying on me, while I'm being extremely careful in handling them, is unacceptable to me."
3,Great people but average product...,The etymotic people helped me greatly when I had one of my ER6's die due to a loose connection or break in the cord. They replaced it with a new one. The only problem is that the new one died in a similar fashion just 7 months later. It lasted about the same amount of time as the first one.I also mentioned to them that the 5 foot cord is FAR TOO LONG. I could put the iPod in a case and strap it to my ankle if I wanted to with that cord. I would pay extra if I could just get a three foot cord. I mentioned this to someone at etymotic and they claimed that people requested the longer cord. What do you think. Let them know if you want a shorter cord via these reviews.
4,Help Students and Help Your Program,We have a communication arts college program using portfolios for program assessment. This book guides students so they can prepare a portfolio for future employment and also prepare a portfolio we can use for accreditation assessment. Students are better prepared for job interviews. Faculty have the concrete assessment data we need to analyze student learning.
2,Does not fit all 460 cc drivers,"I purchased this cover to fit over a 460 cc driver. When I tried to put the cover on my driver, I couldn't even get the head of the driver into the base of the cover. I decided to try it on an old 360 cc driver, and it took about 5 minutes to get the cover on, and have it stay upright on that driver.It may be fun to look at, but I returned it the next day."
5,love the Butthead poodle golf club cover for my husband,Ordered the Butthead cover for my husband's birthday. We have a black toy poodle so he thought this was great!
1,Less useful than my tiny 1958 paper dictionary,"This dictionary is oversimplified. Many words have only a one-word definition. It may be okay for beginners.But worse, it is not properly indexed for the Kindle. It only has one index level, for the first letter of the words. Then you have to page forward, one at a time, to find the word you're looking for. An e-dictionary should be faster and more convenient than paper. This one is slower and more cumbersome.Even for the price it's no bargain."
2,BORING,"I FELT ASLEEP HEARING THIS SOUNDTRACK I HEARD IT CAUSE MY SISTER BOUGHT IT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING 2 BE GOOD AND I FELT ASLEEP!! THEN MY SISTER TOLD ME TO GO 2 THE MOVIES 2 SEE IT SHE SAID I MIGHT LIKE THE MOVIE BETTER SO I SAID YES AND IT WAS 3HOURS OF BORING!! I ONLY LIKE #1SONG WHICH IS ""AND IM TELLING YOU IM NOT GOING"" SO PEOPLE DONT WAISTE UR MONEY ON THIS CD!! I'D RATHER SEE THE MOVIE THEN HEAR THE MUSIC"
1,Never received item - terrible company to work with out of Poway,"I never received this item. This was the second time that they haven't sent an order. They are based in Poway, California. Don't order from them. Buyer beware!"
3,I didn't read it,"The book is well made. I got it because a teacher said so, then never used it. It looks like a decent book. I asked the teacher what to rate it out of 5 stars, she said 3."
1,what is life worth,"I received the book, which had a thousand ants and ant larvae in with it....I took pictures so you could see it....The ants actually ate the pages of the book....I don't know for sure, but almost seems like the book was in a warehouse or something for quite a while!!!"
3,"Tight, but too tall",I found this foot a bit too tall for my machine (it bumped the upper casing). I had to bend the tall plastic part over for it to work.
5,Great Classic Movies,All four of these movies are just wonderful. I was so glad to get all of them with one purchase. Also a great gift idea for anyone you know that loves old movies. However I am not giving these away!
1,This is the worst toy we own!,"This has got to be the worst purchase I have made for my son so far. It is a worthless toy. The mail doors fall off WAY too easily. The letters never stay inside the slots or the doors. I can never seem to find the correct tension setting for my son to actually walk with this toy. He does not even like it. The only thing he ever does is remove the door with the spinning yellow circle and play with it on the floor. Seriously, this is the absolute worst toy I have ever bought."
2,Dwell - How to live well in our post-apocalyptic future,I feel like dwell is showcasing the idea of how to live well in our post-apocalyptic future. This magazine is starting to depress me. Does everything seem grey with stainless steel accents? Modern living is quite warm...what's up dwell? I'm moving past glossiness into some real patina - I'm finding it better for my mood and my pocket book.
3,I'm Done With Dwell,"I have been an enthusiastic reader of Dwell for a couple of years. I liked it for it's focus on modern housing and home products. I have become bored with some of the content aimed at teaching readers about product design and commercial buildings. I am interested mainly in articles about modern homes, interiors, landscapes and furniture. I'm also tired of having environmentalism crammed down my throat. I'm not looking for a political viewpoint; just a good magazine about Modern homes. I'm going to subscribe to Atomic Ranch instead."
2,Dissapointed,I was so looking forward to receiving my NEW magazine DWELL. It arrived faster then I thought. With great excitement and anticipation I opened the pages and found......lots and lots of advertisements. I am SO dissapointed that I canceled my subscription. I Really wanted this to be a visual tool for modern/contemporary design for the average consumer. DONT believe ANY positive reviews.
2,I was expecting more!!!!,"I though that this magazine was awesome, but not,To many comercial pages, the content is minimun.....and is so boring......"
3,"Worth having, but not Cusco's best","Cusco made this album (as well as the album ""2000"") to be a soundtrack for a nature documentary. Most of the songs are pleasant background music, but not as interesting as some of their better songs. However, ""Unknown Paradise"" is a good upbeat song and ""Didjeridoo"" is fun and catchy. If you're new to Cusco, don't get this album; I would recommend ""Ancient Journeys"" or the ""Apurimac"" collection. If you're a longtime Cusco fan, go ahead and get it."
2,Disappointing,"A really disappointing DVD. I love John Lovitz. Funniest guy they had, but this DVD only has a couple of his best bits. Way too much other garbage mixed in with the few good parts."
4,There's always hope,Interesting and there are many who can relate to this situation. I hope other readers will recommend this inspirational book
4,Bishop Jakes Understands Women's Hearts,"Woman Thou Art Loosed is a comforting, encouraging and powerful. This is Bishop T.D. Jakes at his best. You don't have to belong to Bishop Jake's denomination and you don't even have to agree with his theology to enjoy and learn from this book. It really speaks to a woman's broken heart."
2,"honest, appeals to a specific audience","While I can see why so many people have recommended I read this book since I had a past with abuse, I found it a little chauvanistic and written from a man's point of view, but since the author is a man, that shouldn't be surprising. I give it a mixed review...helpful, but puts people into stereotypes sometimes. My neice has attended his church and was very blessed so maybe its just his expression through writing that put me off a bit."
3,The Literature Of Leadership,In reading the 1987 version of this title (there is a 1999 revision published) I am inspired to go back and read the classics that I read (or was supposed to have read) in high school. The book gives us a view of leadership through the eyes of classic authors. What I found disappointing was the lack of any coherent view of leadership or practical methods for implementing any of the lessons learned from literature. The author does provide business examples of the lessons illustrated in the classic literature. An interesting book to read but I came away without any new insights into leadership and how to lead.
4,best alone,"JFrusciante has got the best album alone, appart from Red Hot... The sound of his voice envolves you in an special atmosphere. He has as well an strong personality he transmits thru the lyrics and the music."
1,one star is generous,"Romance novels are supposed to have improbable plots and be written rather heavy-handedly. This book, like Rasey's others, raises (or is it lowers?) the bar for utter badness, in plotting, characterization, and writing, even in cover art. Her narrative stumbles along like it was dragging an anchor, and her dialogue reads like it was written by someone who's never listened to two real human beings converse. Perhaps if Rasey would quit publishing her own books and work with an editor . . . . One star is a generous rating."
2,Dissapointed,I am not happy with this product. After just one use there were cut marks in the board unlike the other 2 boards I purchased (totally bamboo congo and the totally bamboo kenya). There are no cut marks in these. I thought that this board would be the same quality. It is not. Disappointed
2,Nice for a few months.,"After a few months one of the 'raw bamboo' end pieces warped and started to separate from the 'steamed bamboo' body. Now it wobbles on the counter unless I put a towel under it. The grooved edge seemed like it would be convenient but all it seems to do is make the board harder to wipe clean. On the plus side, the surface has held up very well. I will probably replace it with a flat, solid bamboo board."
1,Nightmare to set up,"Not happy with this thing......it is so hard to set up that I had to go to the bathroom twice while doing it. Now I consider myself above average intelligence, but this is a screwy design. Nice concept, bad design. Camping should be easy, not frustrating!Signed,Frustrated and Pinching Off"
1,horrible construction and worse customer service,"QUALITY - JUNKCUSTOMER SERVICE - NON-EXISTENTset up is a joke, quality is a joke, and if you don't mind calling the factory in China for customer service than by all means, buy it. I love the Columbia company history bit..... founded in 1938....sold to the Chinese in 2004. It is a name only, owned by someone who is interested solely in selling a lot of junk, and a few unhappy customers is acceptable to them I guess."
3,Magnetic Photo Frame,I would have preferred a larger frame. I would like to have had one that was not blue. But it was as listed so I guess I got what I ordered. It was good transaction and fast service.
3,Oversized -- no kidding!,"I'm a bit overwhelmed by the weight of these pieces. A dinner fork or tablespoon weighs 2.5 ounces a piece! The other pieces are similarly hefty. That is a huge amount more than the Oneida flatware I am replacing--the same pieces of which weigh a mere 1.1 ounces each.This set is visually elegant, but every time I grab a handful to set the table or pick one up to eat with I wonder if I'm ever going to get used to the sheer weight.I imagine my grandmother would not enjoy using these at my home.6 months later: Our family is now comfortable with the weight of the pieces, though my mother instantly noticed the heft when she came to visit and did not like it."
3,silverwhere,"first of all let me say this, these are heavy duty. very good quality and quite heavy for silver where. only annoying thing is the heavy end is the handle. While that doesn't seem that bad the problem with that is when you put your fork, spoon, ect... on your plate it tends to fall off and hit the floor, but thankfully it sits 12 so you will have plenty of clean ones in the drawer to replace it."
4,Nice weight,"I like the shape and ""heft"" of the flatware...the only problem I have had with the set is that the knife blades become discolored in the dishwasher - I wish someone would invent knife blades that washed up like the handles!"
2,"Ok, but in theory only...","This particular author is a little hard to figure out... First, she DOES seem to have done extensive research, but then she destroys her credibility by making claims that Bill Clinton may have been Henry VIII, Howard Stern was a harem girl, etc. Her method of determining past lives is by having the reader analyze their interests in THIS lifetime... while I don't doubt for one second that the interests and themes of past lives DO carry on into the next, most of the phenomena she points to could be the product of forgotten childhood experiences.This book IS entertaining, though. It would be good for someone who is only exploring the concept of past lives for the first time, and its exercises are somewhat fun to do."
4,great insight & entertainment to those who are curious to learn more about their past selves,"this was a really cool book that gave alot of clues, insights and things to think about. it was written in a fun and entertaining way so that you find yourself flying through the book faster then you thought :) i have been a big believer in past lives and reincarnation and have read many books on the subject and i have always liked barbara lane. i had already had pretty good ideas of my own about my past life identities and she just kind of help shed some light on that and make it more solid. yes i do reccomend this book its a great fun way to learn more about yourself."
2,First time Maui vacationer,"This is not the best book on Maui. Most of the information on ""hidden"" places is not as ""hidden"" as the book would lead you to believe. It is available elsewhere (Frommers, Fodors, Snorkel Maui.) This guide is not easy to use, and doesn't have the nice pictures other books have. We bought 5 books before we went to Maui, and we brought three with us. This was not one of them because we got all of the same information in the other books or on-line."
2,OK book but not great,DO NOT use this book to find hotels or restaurants. It does have good beaches and things to do. As far as the hotels and restaurants it seems like they just took the promotion materials and re-printed them without actually trying the places for themselves.
5,Sound. Biblical Advice for Postmodern Parents...,A book full of truth and wisdom - very incisive about what we should be teaching our daughters and telling us how. Full of plentiful Biblical references to assure parents that they are providing a Scriptural compass.This is a must read! -- The Discerning Reader (@zShops)
1,Don't believe everything you read,"I bought these earphones based on all the great reviews. Wanted to experience music on my new ipod at a new level like many of the reviewers said I would. Absolutely did not happen. The bass was nonexistant even though I crammed those things as far I as dared into my ear canal. Which, by the way, it just a little creepy when you think about it. This can't be good for your ears! These earphones are going back to Amazon as fast as possible."
3,Good Sound but it takes a while,"The ER6 Isolator earphones definitely do isolate sound very well especially when you are traveling in an airplane. Having said that, it takes a good while to get use to the sound reproduction. I tried them first with the installed rubber plugs and no matter how much I tried I did not get a good seal (I must have abnormal ear canals!). Anyway, after much frustration I switch to the foam plugs and lo and behold they worked much better. If you want to get absolute perfect sound these are not for you but if you are looking for good airplane sound insulation and small earphones these are pretty good. Remember, you will not get top of the line sound but with a good seal you will get good bass response."
2,Not Worth the Money,I was disappointed with these earphones. The sound level was low and higher frequency sound seemed attenuated. The $30 Sony MDR-EX51 earphones I already owned sounded much better.
3,Bit naked,"Bought these after reading many of the reviews. I am not a big fan of the ""bass"" sound however these were too bright for my tastes. The sound has a naked feeling. It is missing body, fullness, etc. What's there is good, but the issue is what's not there."
3,Cute Doll,"This is a really cute little doll and I got it on sale for around $14, so I can't complain too much.I was so happy with this doll when it came in the mail right before Christmas, but when my daughter (16 months) opened this gift she threw the doll on the floor and didn't even look at it again. I don't understand why, because she usually really loves baby dolls."
5,My baby's favorite by far!,"My daughter received this doll from her grandma for her first birthday. She loves it! She has carried it around everyday for four months now. It's soft, cute, and durable. The ribbon did come out of the hair, and parts of the hat have come unstitched from the doll's head, but that's because my daughter hauls it around using the hat as a handle, and it could easily be tacked back on. The doll itself is still in perfect condition and she has been through a lot! Yesterday she got her head dunked in the toilet and I put her through the wash (light cycle) and the dryer (cool setting) and she looks as good as new! I was wary of washing her before because the tag says surface wash only, but I'm glad I read some of the reviews on here about washing, because they were right! She washes great. This is a great, high quality doll."
4,I Was There,"As the ""troublemaking older brother"" of this book, I was in and out of Edwards life. I witnessed many of the events described.Although I (the character Kevin) am a product of the mean streets and the dysfunctional family Edward so aptly describes, he rose above it all with an independent streak.This fine coming of age semi-memoir made me laugh out loud, hurt inside, and realize I am proud of the author.The depiction of the chief protagonist (Roberta) is so concise as to be eerie.Written in a stream of consciousness/flash back style, the book moves compellingly thru the trials and tribulations of a boy and then a man seeking answers to often unanswerable questions."
1,Irrelevant and unnecessary,"I hate to write negative reviews, but this book deserves it. Both the title, ""Programming for Linguists,"" and the subtitle, ""Perl for Language Researchers,"" are misleading. This book is really just another ""Perl for Dummies"" book, and not a very good one. There is no code here that is relevant to either linguistics or language research. Linguists who want to learn Perl would be better off with an introductory text from O'Reilly."
5,"THE VALUE, MEANING AND PURPOSE OF LIFE","The The Gift of Peace : Reflections by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin is a spectacular book on three levels:1) He shows how to die and find meaning in our suffering, and how to use it for a higher good;2) He shows how to live in relation to other people, even those who have wronged us;3) He shows us how to grow closer to God through prayer and meditation, regardless of what our ""God concept"" is.For these reasons, this book is for everyone!!!!"
3,"Great music, great songwriting... average sound","Format: Full Frame (4 x 3)Audio: LPCM stereo.Overall, this performance is stunning, and a must have for any Dan Fogelberg fan. His voice sounds higher and different than most of the renowned studio songs, and that may surprise some, but there's no complaint about its quality. The songs are so fine, that one can help but wonder why Dan has been so overlooked and underrated as an artist and songwriter. It's a pity that this is the only way that we can hear Dan Fogelberg on DVD, because they didn't put a lot of work on the sound. As somebody said it, this looks like a simple transfer from the VHS, a poor one in sound, and just acceptable in picture. Luckyly, most of the songs have an average sound, but the interview snippets and some of the songs have a very noticeable distortion. But it's hard not to enjoy the concert even having to go through the abscense of quality in the video. Come on, SONY MUSIC, is this the best that you can do?."
1,Not my taste,I don't care for synthetic music. The CD cover is very misleading. Notice the fine print that says Original Soundtrack played by global stage orchestra. It's a bunch of synthesized music. Don't by this CD if you want the original soundtrack music you actually heard in the movie.
1,Stinks,I wish I'd read the sole review on this. This CD stinks. It's all synthetic. Just terrible. I'd like to find the guy who recorded this and stomp on his toe.
3,Okay book,A good book but not outstanding. Sometimes the story seemed to drag a bit and I had a hard time relating to the characters. But I did really like that it was based off Russian folklore because I haven't read many other fantasy books that have done so.
3,"Great routine, horrible video","This is a really strange video. The instructor does not speak at all. There is a narrator, and she is often off on her cuing, so it's pretty confusing. But the warm up is really great, and really loosens me up. The ab routine is pretty standard, but it's good. I just would use this video a lot if the narrator was not so awful. It was good to watch a couple times, and now I can incorporate some of the moves in while I do other videos."
5,Perfect British Comedy,"I hesitated to watch this series since it couldn't possibly be as good as I remember it. So far, I've watched two episodes and loved them both. Comic genius is an overworked phrase but, it certainly applies to ""Jeeves and Wooster"".To get a sense of what great acting is about, watch an episode of ""House"" then an episode from this ""Jeeves and Wooster""."
5,Addictive,You can't just have one. Get them all. Fry gives a perfect performance and he's not hard to look at either. The other characters are too much fun too.
5,Can't go wrong with Kirsten Dunst,"I absolutely love this movie. Though i am biased because i love just about anything that Kirsten Dunst is in. I strongly recommend this movie even if your not a Kirsten Dunst fan for one simple reason, IT'S AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE. Is it shakespeare? No. Is it oscar-winning material? No. But if you just want to set down for 90 minutes and have fun and be entertained, than you can't go wrong with this movie, because it wasn't made under the assumption that it would win any oscars. It is a fast paced movie with great cheerleading scenes and a lot of cute girls. The plot is perfect for this kind of movie because the writers did't get all fancy with it, it's a simple plot. So I strongly recommend this movie, but then again, I absolutlely adore Kirsten Dunst, and you will too after you see this movie. I also recommend you see her latest movie ""Get Over It"""
4,A hot chick flick with not a bad story.,"What a great movie. I saw it with a bunch of guys and we thought it was half-decent. The story was pretty corny in some ways but it was very entertaining. The babes made the movie enjoyable for guys. Kirsten (not Kristen) Dunst is a true beauty. She is a very talented actress and I look forward to seeing her in many other movies. This movie, has a lot of Laugh Out Loud humor. I found many of the jokes funny (especially the male cheerleaders!). Girls, I think they love this movie. In the halls, I always hear ""I saw BUR!! It's cold in here. I say there most be some toros on the atmosphere! It'll be stuck in your head i warn. In the end, i think this movie is worth seeing. Girls will love it and guys will enjoy it. It's just the way things are."
3,Love/hate.,"I kind of love and hate Bring It On starring Kristen Dunst. Parts of this teen flick are clever and funny but after a few viewings of this film, you get pretty sick of all the cheerleading nonsense. Cute chick flick but fades with time, decide for yourself."
4,Suprisingly enjoyable comedy,"I saw ""Bring It On"" with distinctly low expectations, not being a big fan of teen films or cheerleading or sports, but ""Bring It On"" was a cut above the rest due to a fast paced storyline, and the always fabulous Kirsten Dunst. The Romance in the film was believeable and pretty touching and you may go away from the film with a new respect for Cheerleading, which this movie presents as a sport. There is tons of laughs from the ""spirit stick"" to some old fashioned ...iness. A fun flick."
5,dope,"This movie was Delivered to my House in 2 days. Super awesome and Not a skip during the entire film. Good condition and everything. I mean, simply, i Loved it:)"
5,Loved It!,"I loved this film! This is one of the best teen films since ""Clueless."" The film is about a national cheerleading competition. Unless you've seen one of these competitions on ESPN, you've probably never seen cheers like this. The cheers alone are fascinating to watch. The movie is also very funny and even a little romantic. The cast works wonderfully together. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this video or to recommend it to anyone."
4,"Funny, and cute...","But, WAY too stereotypical. Just try this teen flick. I think you'll like it. And any parent that isnt completely overprotective will let there 11+ year olds watch it."
1,BAD,"Put simply this movie is awful.Only in America would a movie this bad have been made.If this movie had been created in any other country the director,writers and producers would have beeen dragged out into the streets and shot.As for the cast you can't blame them,they just can't act."
3,A competitive edge to the teen scene.,"Unlike most teen flicks that are just about showing flesh, bad acting, and a predictable endings, this movie has a little more to offer. Don't get me wrong, it was also about showing flesh, just not as much as say ""Varsity Blues."" Of course there is male/female relationship thing, but this movie is about, you guessed it, Cheerleading. It is a new school year and the old Cheerleading Captain has moved on and in her place has chosen Dunst character to fill her shoes. Shortly after, Dunst finds out that the cheers ""Big Red"" has been giving them for the past 6 years have all been stolen from the Clovers down in East Compton. This starts a bitter dispute leaving Dunst and her squad needing a new act. After being humiliated at a State Competition, the San Diego Toro's are determined to come out on top. I won't give away the ending, but I was guessing until the very end. All in all the film was enjoyable and fast paced."
5,Totally Bamboo 6-inch bowl,"I bought this bowl to use as a salad serving bowl for two people and I just love it. Perfect size for salad or rice for two. I get many compliments on it. Even though it must be hand washed and dried, makes a great addition to any table service."
5,What about the music?,"Mitch Irish! 'nuff said. This man should be a legend. The performance of ""The Friends"" is the only reason I voted 5 stars. Haven't seen the movie yet, but I ordered it to see Mitch... I love him. I only dream he takes off the restraining order so I can smell his hair one last time."
5,The only cookbook I use,"I have had this cookbook for 2 years and it is the only cookbook I use. It is great for entertaining or just for yourself. In fact, it's so good I've often made a recipe for the first time when preparing a meal for guests (usually the biggest mistake of entertaining) but the recipes have all turned out great. No one ever knows it's a ""light"" meal either. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who enjoys cooking and likes to watch their intake for health and wellness. Most of the recipes are easy to make as well."
5,"Excellent, como siempre","Los Mismos continue to enchant fans who've known them over the years, first as Los Bukis, now with the addition of lead singer Pedro Velasquez, as Los Mismos.Their romantic sound of guitars, rhythms that make you want to dance, and beautiful harmonies is among the best of Latino music.This CD is definitely worth owning, and I promise you'll be singing along, even if you don't understand the words."
1,Paper Chase,I did not receive this CD. I received the wrong CD and I never got the correct one. But my money was refunded.
3,Good price for cheap quality parts,"Drill bits broke like matchsticks, didn't get more than 2 uses from them, so don't buy this for them. The extra drive bits are always nice to have, so if you're buying this for them, you'll be pleased.You get what you pay for."
3,nice case,Hitachi 728704Uhm well...The nut setters seem to work well and they have magnets. The case seems sturdy. The driver bits seem to be a different story however. I burned through all #2 square drives in lass than a 1# box of screws. Normally I would expect at least 1# if not 5#s (or more) of service from one bit. There is a reason they give you a lot of them. The case is useful however as you can replace the bits with higher quality ones. I haven't tried the drill bits yet.Overall an OK set I suppose if you get it at a very good price and don't use it much. I expected more from Hatachi tools.One interesting note: How often do you see a product come with disposable plastic cover screwed on to the case with a half dozen screws?
2,Disapointing,Bits are difficult to remove from storage and will not stay in the bit holder. Would not recommend.
2,RONG REFERENCE,"I received a rong item, the one you send to me , is similar but not the same in the picture.THANKS.El articulo que recibi es similar pero no es el mismo de la foto , es posible que se equivocaran en la referencia.GRACIAS"
5,Great Joe Walsh CD/Cassette With A Humorous Title,"THE SMOKER YOU DRINK, THE PLAYER YOU GET is a great CD/cassette that includes many classic songs, including, especially, the sports anthem ""Rocky Mountain Way"" and the midtempo rocker ""Meadows."" The album continues Walsh's direction from his James Gang years while pointing the way towards his work with the Eagles. While there's plenty of humor to be found here, Walsh is clearly no novelty act. Walsh's advocacies of sanctions against countries which convict foreign tourists for trumped-up crimes and increased funding for law enforcement/community policing make this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
1,A Drag to Watch,"After the first 15 minutes I knew that the best part of the movie had past, but I kept watching because I paid for it... I should have stopped. I Shot Andy Warhol keeps getting worse as it goes on. Lili Taylor is a bore to watch and none of the other characters are able to save the movie. This movie was just all around bad and a drag to watch. Pick another independant film if you're looking for something interesting."
1,"Horrible movie, even for a Warhol and Lili Taylor fan!","I've always been interested in Warhol and the Factory, and think Lili T. is a terrific actress. But the character of Valerie Solanas is such an annoying bore, with absolutely no redeeming or sympathetic qualities, that this is a real drag to watch. The reennactment of Solanas's play about turds (!!) was especially stupid and pointless. And the movie makes the Factory seem totally boring and Warhol totally talentless, too, even though I think they did occasionally do interesting work.As others may have mentioned, Michael Imperioli (Christopher of The Sopranos) has a small role, and John Ventimiglia (the restaurant owner on Sopranos) has a TINY and rather pathetic role as a guy who gets off on watching lesbians have sex! Makes you realize how many turkeys an actor has to be in before he gets into something good!"
3,Better than most SCI FI movies IMHO,"I've seen this movie a several times, and would buy the DVD. I'm not going to write a boring, in depth review, but I do like this movie. In addition to being a fan of horror films, I'm also a believer in respect for Native American sacred places and in conserving the environment, and those issues moved the action in this film, which made it more interesting than most to me. I've seen 2 different apparent release dates for this film on DVD here, but both have long since passed; I really wish whoever owns the rights would go on and put it out there, as I'm sure I'm not the only one who enjoys it. Plus, if the series Moonlight continues on, fans of the series' star, Alex O'Loughlin, might be interested in this movie as well, because he does have a featured role."
1,"First TV release, then DVD release, no Movie release :(",Just watched it during its premiere on Sci Fi. Now itll get the DVD release on June 14th. Not a bad movie but not worth the 25 plus dollars amazon wants :(
1,!!!!????,"Truly the most insipid, ignorant and boring dance music (techno or otherwise) I have ever heard. Save your money and dance to the dishwasher sounds instead. There should be a special concentration camp for non-creative slugs like this."
5,Vanilla Ice is an American Institution,"Vanilla Ice is the most ingenious musician of our century. He has influenced modern musical geniuses such as Radiohead, creed, Nirvana, and Smashing Pumpkins. The Poetic lyrics blend perfectly with hot fudge beats to make the perfect VANILLA ICE-cream sundae. And who can forget the ingenious lyrics like ""cooking MCs like a pound of bacon?"" It is sublime."
5,Vanilla Ice and Hammer--You can't lose!,"Cheesy as it is, this CD is a must-have for any fan of 90's music. Hammer and the Iceman were a couple of flamouts, but you gotta give them credit for the few hits that they had. Here's to more cheesy beats that everybody knows the words to!"
4,Great Great Baby; Can't Touch It!,"Ahhhhh, what a dream come true. Vanilla Ice and Hammer on one CD. This is the best joining of the forces since peanut butter got together with jelly. Imagine two of the biggest ""where are they now?"" flameouts on the same CD. Most of these tracks are from the glorious music year of 1990 when the wall was still up, stocks were down, and a young and rebellious Luther Campbell was banned in the U.S.A. What memories. The only thing keeping this from being five stars is the exclusion of Milli Vanilli. That would have been awesome. A trifecta of 90's has-beens.....although technically Vanilla Ice was a ""never was"" but it still would have been the best trio since Jack, Janet, and Chrissy. A must buy!!!!!!"
5,AWESOME,"OH MY GOD!, this album really gets by blood pumping. and that Vanilla--he's so cute. I wish i had that hair!!! If only I could get him to give me some of those dance lessons!! That and that alone is what i live for. I could hippitty-hoppitty to that music all night long. He's so DREAMY!!!"
5,A LITTLE KNOWN JEWEL FROM HIP-HOP'S GOLDEN ERA!!!,"I really miss this era when Rap made sense and did not glorify killing and degrading women. Unique is an excellent lyricist and Dashan's production (RIP) added a unique chemistry. I am glad to see this album re-released and I hope it does well. This album was the precursor for the X-Clan (notice the hat and black medallions) and was one of the first of the Conscious Raps, although there's something on there for everyone! Unique & Dashan deserve their place in Hip-Hop History!"
4,Bench Dog Push Stick,This is a very well built tool even though it is made of plastic.The docking station although a good Idea is just in the way. All together I give this a four star rating.
3,Cool tool,This is a nice tool to have for your table saw. I use it every time I cut small strips of wood and it does the job of keeping my fingers away from the blade.
5,Bench Dog 10-025 Push-Loc Offset Push Stick,"Outstanding, great item, works great on my table saw and router table. Package delivered on time. Highly recommendedand looking forward to new products."
2,Not As Funny As I Thought,"I do agree with the reveiw that says Athat this book is a ""Magical Work of stupidity"". I do also agree with the reveiwer who says ""Hilarious"". it is hilarious if you are the right type of person for the book. It isn't as funny as i thought it would be. I do not recomend it."
5,I loved it!!,"This is a wonderful movie. I loved it when Elizabeth (Judi Dench) asked her granddaughter, ""What is the best way to honor the dead?"". And the answer from this child...""Go on living"". So true!! The music was wonderful, I love all those old big bands tunes from the 40's. I will be watching this one over & over."
4,Judi Dench can do no wrong.,"No matter what Dame Judi does it is always marvelous. And to see Cleo Laine was a treat, and to hear her sing. Oooh la la."
3,A bit disappointing but worth the viewing,"If you are a Judi Dench fan and have collected all she's done, of course you'll jump to it for this DVD. However, it is so much more fluff than expected, one feels obligated to preface one's sharing with ""don't expect too much of this"". Although glimpses of past stars seemed more like walk-on tributes, it was enjoyable to see them again. Ian Holm plays his part as if it were autobiographical. Now that was fun."
1,not as shown,"item not backlit as shown. very hard to read. item returned same day i bought it, and bought different item."
2,"whats this, I haven't a clue to what that is!","I Don't like this item for the reason's because One { 1 } it is Nothing like what it is in the discription. Two { 2 } The Liquid Crystal Display is ALMOST Non Exsisant, and Thirdley { 3rdly } The Volume of the Voice Activation for when the telephone rings is so Low / Soft, that one can bareley Hear It.In my own Opinion, it's NOT, NOT Worth the Expense for this OR Anything else that Doesn't Work the way it is supposed to!"
1,JUNK>>>JUNK>>>>>>JUNK,"I agree with one of the other reviews, this appears to have a nice blue back light; however, it doesn't. Don't buy this piece of junk!!!!!!"
2,Kinda Boring,"I liked this game but just wish the levels would'nt look all the same.It got boring after awhile. Thank goodness it was quick to beat, otherwise I would of turned it off and forgot about it."
4,it'sallgood,this game is ok for your first game. It is kinda easy axcept for the bosses.They can be challenging and frustrating at times.I thought it was pretty cool because i like spongebob.i liked the weapons like the jellyfish net and you can always karate your enemies.i didnt like that you never got to do stuff with patrick or any other people axcept for getting weapons from them.and yes i know i spelled axept wrong.i am not tring to spell corectly.THE END
1,it sounds really good!!,I havent played the game yet but from what i have heard so far it seems like a great game. Thats also the reason I gave it only 1 star otherwise it would be higher probably. Im not really that sure if I want to but it yet but Im willing to give the game a try!
1,Why did they had to make a third one?,"Sorry ya'll but in my opinion, I thought Mighty Ducks 3 wasn't very good. It had a lousy plot and the acting was pretty bad. I thought it was a lousy sequel. I think they should have stopped at 2 because I liked the others better than this one. I can't beleive I wasted my money to see this stupid movie."
1,Cheap silly movie,"This is such a cheap movie. Its basically about three main guy friends, and their pathetic relationship with the same woman. She plays them for fools and when they find out that their all dating the same woman they resentfully agree to still date her at the same time....She basically uses them and they use women, etc.. Its a stupid movie and I would never reccomend it to anyone! I was quite happy when in the end they broke up their friendship because they were dating the same woman. They deserved it, however she also deserved to be punished for what she did!I mean how can you use people like that? Regardless of who they are, men or women it doesn't matter. Its too disrespectful and should be avoided and cheap junk hollywood content with innuendon, profanity, and etc... Avoid!"
3,Definitely Not The Jewel in A&E's DVD transfer Crown,"I was worried from all the negative reviews that this would be an unwatchably bad transfer. However, it had been so long since I'd seen this and I'd missed it so much that I took a chance and ordered it.I'm glad I did. I don't foresee this being queued up for a quality bluray transfer anytime soon. It is indeed a poor transfer and there is nothing special done for this '25th anniversary' edition. However, it is an acceptable version. Production values on this were low from the production's inception and its strength is entirely in its acting, dialogue and direction. If you have the attention span to overlook low production values, there is ample consolation to be found in the deft storytelling efforts of the cast and crew. Along with other reviewers, I wish it were remastered, but in lieu of an upgrade, this one will do."
5,stands the test of time,"First shown on PBS almost thirty years ago, the series still has great power and beauty. I never tire of watching it."
3,Is This the Complete Original Series?,"When the series was first broadcast on PBS, I had the great good fortune to view each episode twice, as the series was being aired on two different PBS Channels at the same time. The series was beautifully done. Years later, I ordered the series on Video cassettes, and much to my sorrow, I found that the episode, ""The Towers of Silence"" had been edited out of the series. It just happens that this episode is one of the few which I remember by name. Granted, some very disturbing things happend in this episode, but it was part of the whole. I would like to obtain the entire series, as originally broadcast, not a sanitized version. Before I risk buying another version of this series, I would like to see a list, by name, of each episode included in the offering. All of the versions I find for sale are of 8 episodes, like my cassettes. I want a copy of the entire series, warts and all."
3,enjoyable music but not little Joe's best.,"Nice listening music/ However there is nothing like tistening to the years past favorites such as Las Nubes. etc,etc, Little Joe your are still good ('Pesao"")"
3,"Not bad, but...","Tender is the Night is certainly a professional effort, however it is dull, it is a bit dense, and the timelines occasionally are confusing, making the first two obeservations even more glaring. It is a sad story, but one in which I found a chore to read for the most part. It seems to cerebral to conjur up the passion of a taboo love affair and the malaise of a dying one. We can't compare all of a writer's work to his greatest triumph (gatsby in this case) but since I read Tender is the Night because I liked Gatsby so much, the comparison is inevitable.Maybe I'm too young to truly understand this story or better yet feel it, but I have a feeling when I'm older I won't want to attempt another pass."
3,"Flawed, repellent characters trapped in their brittle lives","F Scott Fitzgerald's prose, sometimes brilliant, sometimes opaque, too often seeming to search for effect, manages to bring to life his unlikeable, brittle characters in their class-cocooned world. A disagreeable but intriguing book. Watch out for the anti-gay passage, two-thirds through - unempathetic and dismissively judgmental, to the point of being homophobic, even by 1920s standards."
2,the jazz age with the rich and glamorous,"I tried to read this because it's a standard of the American novel in the 20s. But I could not finish it. The characters are rich, spoiled, glamorous and fascinating to each other. But that's all. Imagine a novel length fantasy written for a Hollywood gossip magazine. That's what you have here.The writing is occasionally striking, but there is nothing in it that I want to read about.I think it was Hemingway who quoted Fitzgerald as saying ""The rich are different from you and me."" Papa's answer: ""Yeah, they have more money."" That sums it up quite well."
5,I once was blind..,"This was one of the most fascinating books I have read, everyday I looked forward to it. I was most impressed with Shermer's mastery of multiple and diverse disciplines, my IQ must have gone up a few points from reading such a well written and elegant tome. Its comprehensive style reminded me of Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" because it opened my mind to things I never considered and made me think. I find it difficult to point out what I liked about the book because it has so much to offer however I was moved as Shermer touchingly explained how he has found meaning in a world without god. I too was a Christian once and have gone though the same existential and philosophical struggles. I felt an intellectual and emotion freedom as I read of his appreciation in the awe of the natural world and his coming to understand his place in it as a ""homo sapiens"" or ""wise man"". Such considerate expression gave me a new understanding of what it means to be a freethinker."
4,Pretty Good,"The company shipped promptly and I received it within a couple days of ordering, so I am satisfied with the service. The product isn't bad either. It's sugar free so it's not amazing, but it helps make some pretty good guilt free coffee."
4,Very moving and (thankfully) Somewhat Dated,"This film is a wonder for many reasons: beautiful performances, sharp writing and directing, and SAD. When I first saw this - the sobbing in the theater was so intense that I thought I'd have to build an ark to get home. Now, Longtime Companion is still all of those things but a little dated. Advances in medicine haved moved us to a point where AIDS is not an immediate death sentence. Watching this film years later it does play a bit like ""And Then There Were None"" - but it still works. Watch it and remember if you lived through that era, watch it and be greatful if you did not."
4,Still Relevent,This moview will make you laugh and cry. It show that love and care that a group can give.
3,Worth having,"This is actually a 3 & 1/2 star album--better than average (3) but not really outstanding (4). For awhile I thought this would fall into the ""superb musicianship"" category but the songs save it from that bloodless fate. There are much better LL discs available but this one is worth having for the great tunes identified by some of the reviewers. Worth having even for the non-Lovett completist.Would love to see a NEW album of NEW originals ! A live a lbum a covers album and a greatist hits as the last three releases is fairly unsatisfying."
5,Lavender incense,"I love this incense. It is not overpowering, yet leaves the house smelling wonderful. Good to use after cooking strong-odor foods."
5,Fat Flush Diet,"I purchased this book along with the other books in Louise Gittleman series including the Fat Flush Diet, The Fat Flush Exercise; and the One Day detox Fat Flush.This journal is great and was a super price.I will probably purchase another one when this one runs out. I like all the suggestions it has as well as reminders for the rest of your life besides just the diet.Like how are you sleeping? What are your challenges? Weekly weigh-in and measurement.What rewards do you plan when you reach a goal. I have been using this for 8 days and find it very helpful.I have lost 2 lbs!!"
5,A Must Read for Anyone Interested in Serial Murder!,This book is the first book I always consult when beginning a new research project on serial murder. Hickey has done an excellent job evaluating previous research as well as conducting his own study. He covers a wide range of topics that are valuable to students and professionals. I highly recommend this book and look forward to Hickey's future works!
5,What a text,"As a writer, I am always looking for accurate information to pass on to my readers. This textbook goes beyond my expectations. It also debunks myths and gives global information on the subject."
2,French Food At Home,"I must admit that whilst this book is what I ordered, it is quite different from what I anticipated! Having watched Laura Calder's TV series which is called 'French Food at Home', I assumed that this book would have all the recipes from the series. Unfortunately it has not - it is still a reasonably good book but not what I had hoped for and is therefore a little disappointing! Also it is printed in a very cheap form, without any pictures of recipes and not even one of Laura Calder, and one feels that this book was very cheaply put together. I realise that the price wasn't very expensive although when converted into our NZ $$$ plus postage etc. it became quite expensive. Maybe more information on the web page would have helped - a picture of the book and a sample of the recipes! I do like almost everything that Laura Calder does so I will use this book, but it just wasn't what I was expecting!"
5,Oui! You Must Add This Recipe Book To Your Shelf!,"Laura Did it, another recipe book that is so enjoyable. She has shared withyou recipes that are new to your serving.Staral/Georgia"
5,Real(istic) French Food,"What a gift for those of us with neither the time nor the patience for classical French technique! From the ""helpful hints"" to the wry comments, this book makes French cooking a lot of fun, not just accessible. I have yet to make anything that disappointed even my finicky five-year old. And with the increasing emphasis on fresh, seasonal fare, this book has been a great source of ideas for things to do with (even more) tomatoes, corn, peaches, etc., etc. No matter your skills, or lack thereof, in the kitchen, you will find yourself reaching for this book again and again."
2,What A Creepy Program,"The concept is so good, but the execution is way too cute and over-produced and couldn't they have found a less terrifying host? Oh, and that annoying music! French food is a wonder. French Food At Home is a nightmare."

5,Little known Hemingway gem!,"I discovered this one at my local library -- donated in 1968, but never taken out! Great stuff -- Papa writes cleaner and with a whole lot less ""chest beating"" when it's his journalism. The preface notes that Hemingway re-packaged many of his reporting articles as fiction -- this is a cool selection of fishing, hunting, WWII, Spanish war -- take a look!Very fast shipping from the supplier, and exactly as described -- thanks!"
3,Incomplete version of book,"I have almost all of Nevil Shute's books in paperback, and I have purchased all of them on my kindle. I greatly enjoy and reread his books. I purchased the ""Vintage Classic"" kindle version of ""Lonely Road"". In the original there was a preface (4 pages), purported to be by Stevenson's lawyer, which provided additional information on the main character, Malcolm Stevenson and his life. This preface was an integral part of the story, but was missing from the Vintage Classic kindle version. There was no indication that this version was not complete. I am disapointed with this version, particularly at the price charged for Shute's books."
5,"""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"" is a delicious work.","Richard Yates was a brilliant writer of novels and short stories who was universally admired by his peers including--among others--Tennessee Williams, John Updike, and Phillip Roth. His novel ""Revolutionary Road"" was considered groundbreaking when it was published in 1961. Never commercially successful after that, Yates continued to write and taught on a number of college campuses including the University of Iowa Writing Program. ""Eleven Kinds of Loneliness"" is delicious."
1,Mars Gets Left Out In The Cold,"After the first several sections, Mars isn't mentioned again until the last several sections. Graham Hancock should have entitled this ""Lessons In Comets and Their Orbits"". No secrets between Mars and Earth were forthcoming. He threw in his usual spiel about the age of the pyramids, where they're located, etc, etc. With a dash of his precession theories. Not a very good book to read it you are looking for any relationship between Mars and Earth. A big disappoint! Could have been summed up by just saying, we're not sure if that's a face or not - end of book."
3,"Ok, but not great","This book starts out talking about the Mars face and other strange archaeology, which was pretty interesting. Then the author spends way too much time on comets and asteriods. It seems that the earth/mars connection is that not only did Mars suffer a blast from a comet but that the same fate awaits earth and NASA and the government are covering it up so as not to alarm the people."
5,TR 3 purched at amazon.com,Best paint restoration product I have ever used! This product brought the shine back to some old farm equipment better than I thought would be possible. I would recommend this for any vehicle that has lost it's shine. Some types of paint do restore better than others though. On one tractor there were several different types of metal that were all painted red. Some paints really came back red while others were definitely better but not as good.
2,"Oddly, Didn't work for my car.","After reading numerous satisfied reviews, I decided to go with Blue Magic TR-3.My car had been heavily oxidized, especially the hood which had been replaced after an accident.I applied this to the hood, carefully rubbed it off, but nothing visible seemed to happen.I tried this application for several times but to no avail.Personally, I would prefer conventional wax (Turtle wax, etc) over this product."
2,It Really Is Dated,"I finally saw this movie for the first time. Although it is not currently available, I requested it from my local video store and they were able to find a copy. I had always looked forward to seeing this movie and had heard a lot about it, but I was very disappointed. I totally agree with the reviewer above (or below?) who called it dated. I'm sure it was really powerful back in the eighties, but boy how times have changed. The performances are over-the-top and although it's based on real events, it isn't depicted believably. It's a good movie, but shows how times have changed so quickly in what passes as believable performances."
2,There are better books on this subject.,"I tried recipes from this book and they are awefull. Funky combinations that do not work. Some of the recipes are very basic and may appeal to people who do not like exotic or fancy food. For better recipes and recipes that offer more variety, flavor and flair, I like the American Diabetes Association Diabets Cookbook and Joslin's Diabetic Gourmet Cookbook."
5,What War is really all about...,"Marlon Brando (very, very young in this one) in his first major movie role really shines and shows us why cameras always loved him.Just a glimpse of his eye, and you guess what he's thinking.What an actor!The movie is a very short tale of a soldier wounded in battle, who returning home discovers that he has lost a limb.The real battle ensues from then on. Will he be able to survive the ordeal? Will he be able to still have a normal life among people?""The Men"" is an ageless movie, still valid nowadays as it was back then, in the 50's.Solid story, solid actors, straight storyline, non-obtrusive score, make this a tiny masterpiece in its own right.The transfer on DVD is astonishingly excellent, as is its sound. The Black & White image is crisp and clear.I can only remmond it to all the fans of Marlon Brando, as well as those who never saw him in one of his earliest roles."
3,Colorful Earrings,I purchased a lot of different earrings on this shopping trip and these were my least favorite when I received my order. They do have a lot of colors in them so they match almost anything in your closet.
5,Further Yugoslavia Question,"Norman Naimark, famous author of Fires of hatred (trad. also in Italy), with other expert scholars (Vucinich, Emmert, Fine, etc)fill with that book a historiographic vacuum about a complex and unexplored question. A little bit space should devote to medieval origins of the conflicts.In last analysis a beatyfull book."
4,Surprisingly sophisticated,"The style is a little old-fashioned, but the book is a surprisingly sophisticated, knowledgeable and even-handed account of Jewish traditions of magic in northern European communities in the late middle ages. An entertaining treatment of a subject that is not well known or understood."
4,Looks Great,"These tabs look great in the office, they are easy to put together and have an overall professional look. The only problem I experienced would have been trying to download the application you need in order to print the tabs. But once i got that figured out, the assembly was easy. I would highly reccomend these printable tabs to others."
4,excellent dvd but...,"I have used this several times.Her fat-burning workout is good especially the cha-cha and mambo part but only one thing, her cueing is off.Most of the time she is cueing you and she has already started doing the move. At one time, she cues you to do something but she does the other move. You will end up stopping for a while and catch the next move she does. The other workouts are just great if you've been exercising for quite a while. I like the abs workout most, its the best!"
3,Not my favorite,"There are good and bad things that I discovered about this DVD. I found the cardio portion to be short and the dance steps were hard to follow. I realize that it was meant to be low impact, but I never felt really challenged, other than trying to keep up! I liked the target toning segments. It was nice to have a choice of which area you wish to work and with what intensity. It makes it easier to do the workout everyday without getting over tired. I think that I will do a different cardio workout along with the toning section of this DVD."
2,try it if you realy like her,"I never use this DVD anymore - mostly because I hate Denise's style, all the sugary positive talk makes me nuts. The aerobic section is badly qued and I find it boring. The toning, while effective is realy based on the same old exercises we've been doing forever. The mind body cooldown is such a wild mix of styles you get nothing at all."
4,I delightful and quick read,"Great fun. Not much new information relative to her first book, but well worth the price and time. She writes a charming book."
1,A Nightmare,"I bought this phone through a supplier via an online travel site. This phone is an absolute nightmare to navigate. Now that most of us nowadays text instead of talking, the A70 makes it absolutely near impossible to do so. The phone feels cheap. What is worse is that depending on your provider, a phone call costs 2.00 USD or 80 per text! If you are considering using a phone abroad, do not get this. A piece of junk."
1,This CD is Offensive,"I like music of all types. I like to think I have an open mind. But, I found this CD to be distasteful and offensive. I would not recommend it to anyone. The only song I like on it is ""I Know."" This song is on the City of Angels soundtrack."
2,He's much better live,"I saw Jude open for Tori Amos and I was taken aback... he was really something else. Then I bought this cd and was extremlely disappointed, all the emotion and power in his voice was gone. Oh well..."
4,What a pleasant suprise!,"Now here I go out to buy this cd because the Rick James song was good enough even if the rest was bad...I put the cd in ....then..WHAM! Is it possible for a 40 year old man to be this excited about music? You bet. Here's Don MClean meets AL STEWART at both their bests, throw in a very hip 90s sensibilty and that's Jude. Don't miss this one."
3,"Cliche ridden, but worthwhile","Desert Hearts is a competent film, but its marred by stereotypical characters and a tendency toward melodrama. However, director Donna Deitch does a good job creating sexual tension between the two main characters. And the love scene is brilliant and achieves a genuine eroticism rarely seen in films. (Note the way the total absence of music heightens the sense of realism in this scene.)"
4,Sent to a Friend,I looked over the book when I got it. From what I could tell it's all that I needed it to be. But it wasn't for me. I got it for a friend of mine who needed something like this. And she said it has been very helpful for her. That's all I needed to hear.
5,this book was a lifesaver,This book helped me so much in my work. Easy to read and understand the cross reference is the bomb/
1,Doesn't live up to the title,"This book would be more aptly named ""A History of Microsoft Operating Systems: The Basics"". As with another reviewer, I had to have this book for a course I took. There is little discussion of universal operating system fundamentals outside of file systems. The vast majority of the book focuses on MS operating systems. They spend more time talking about Windows 3.1 than Mac or UNIX. You want a book to help in troubleshooting or solving problems with operating systems? Unless you're a computer system neophyte this book won't help you. On the other hand, if you know little about operating systems and would like to learn the basics of how they work and the evolution of PC OSs, this would be a useful book."
5,GOD THANK YOU FOR PSYCHE O!,"i didn't buy this here. i got it at the tower records here in atlanta...well....buckhead...technically...but even still, this cd is the best hip hop album i've bought in the last year, for SURE. the dj's on here are superb (you can catch their promo for samurai champloo on adult swim), the emcee is so dope its almost painful, and the production is perfect for my tastes. if you love hip hop, buy this now....also, get Collective Efforts - Trail Mix, here on amazon....also anything by Minamina Goodsong.....werd."
5,Classic comedy,"For anyone who has experienced the pretentiousness of academic life, this is the funniest book written. All new assistant professors should be given a copy."
4,This book has aged a bit but is still a must-read!,"I am 16 years old. I was required to read a book off of a list for my Honors English class. This looked like the best book to read. It has aged a bit, and I found some of the situations difficult to relate to (because I'm 16) but I absolutely loved this book. Make sure you get it!"
3,Wodehouselike.,It was OK. Worth the price. Good for a mindless relaxing read. It reminded me very much of Bertie and Wooster.
1,Not sure yet,"I haven't replaced my previous fliter yet to make a comment. But I hope it fits as I order 16x24 and I recieved 16x25x1, maybe that's the next something, not sure. But will submit after I am sure it fits and works. What I will say is that the washing only is appealing vs. having to buy more."
1,Does not seem to do any filtering,"After 3 months in furnace it was as clean as new, Rinse water had no visible dirt. There was nothing to indicate that the Web Plus air filter did any filtering"
4,read Arlo's review and do what's right for you,"It's a great movie and is my primary Thanksgiving tradition, but I'm not buying this DVD until the artist is happy with the whole package, artistic AND business presentation. I will just play my old VHS copy again this year and wait this one out. For those of you who want something tasty while you wait, check out the Arlo Guthrie/Pete Seeger double CD ""Together in Concert,"" because it's full of good feelings and great songs."
5,Can you really get ANYTHING you want?,"Come on now, who couldn't like this silly movie? A Christmas classic that will have you singing along in no time. In fact, I was singing this tune on my motor cycle (without a pickle) on the way to work this morning. Go figure."
4,The Desert of Wheat,"It is awell written story. I like growing things in my garden, and it taught me to love the land more."
3,Masterpiece? No. Good Music? Yes.,"""Electronica,"" for lack of a better term, is a religion; you're always in danger of offending the true believers. Hip-hop is similar in that an artist's ""cred"" is on the line. I take a different approach to my music: if it sounds good, I buy it; if it doesn't, I don't. Anyway, I have a vast array of diverse music, and Riddim Warfare definitely has its place. I enjoy the beats, the samples, the mood. I bought it. If you're drenched in one musical genre or another, however, you'll probably find that aspect of Riddim lacking; if not, give it a spin."
4,It came early!,it came much earlier than i had anticipatedwhich i thought was awesomethe item was working well
3,Works as advertised.,Pros:+Works as advertised.Cons:-Extremely overpriced for what is essentially a remote control. (Purchased at $~40)-Drains batteries at extreme rate (Had to swap twice over course of 3 months of light use)
5,60 years of poodle history--first-hand,"Huge, HB massively oversized 4to size, s/b priced to account for projected shipping costs, really exceptional breed history and reference by the Queen of Judges, Mrs. Nicholas; 525 pp, color and b/w photos, terrific early history of the breed (by one who was there) in the US, including rare history of Mrs Milton Erlanger and her famous black standard poodle, Ch Pillicoc Rumplestiltskin, and Blakeen Kennels, the Carillion dogs and more! NOTE: This book is hard to find, but not worth the over-$900 a seller is asking here on Amazon. How do they sleep at night?)"
4,A complete idea of international business,"I liked this book. I am doing the international MBA at Maryville University. The book is very complete and has great illustrations, graphics, and web links.Is a very interesting book, and I will keep it. But I think that although there is a chapter related to logistics, the book is not deeply mentioning import and export procedures and other custom and paperwork problems that international business faces."
5,Good to go!,"Perfect! Stores all my husbands RC Car ""stuff""! This is exactly what he was lookin for-sturdy, compact yet it has plenty of storage!"
3,It says XL but really a Med-L,"I am pregnant with twins and bout this about 13 weeks, thinking it would help my back and it was great when I first bought it, i specifically bought XL to grow with it but it didnt work out that way I am currently 19w and now have to get another belt."
2,interesting premise falls flat,"I was really looking forward to this book based on a review in the Wall Street Journal. The book begins promisingly enough but quickly devolves into a series of unrealistic, outlandish little episodes (some of which are amusing, hence 2 stars instead of 1) without any rationale. Lack of character development is the driving weakness to the book, undermining the credibility of every event. Having read the book, I'd be hard pressed to describe the protagonist's physical appearance, age, professional or personal history. Muddling matters is the 3rd person style of writing which actually 'feels' like the protagonist describing events in the 1st person. If you're looking for a good summer book, try something else."
1,Insincere Book,"Reading this book reminded me of lots of consultants I have met who state the obvious and then look around a crowded room expecting everyone to applaud them on their breakthrough insights and wisdom. The story of Yates, a futurist suddenly disenchanted by his own hypocricy, just did not do it for me, even if it had bits of interesting sarcasm and irony scattered through the text. Actually I liked the Marjorie character most,the Jo'Berg hooker. Human and even semi-believable. I could not say that for the rest of the book."
2,Dismal Futurist,"First, a confession. I am a futurist, so my reading of this book was not necessarily objective. Having said this, I did try to like the book. After all, it is publicity for my profession, and, as the old saying goes, any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name correctly. And the author, to his credit, does spell futurist correctly.The hero is unappealing -- self-pitying, morose, bitter, whiny. Not a good role for Johnny Depp. Apparently, as he looks back at a very successful career, he feels he was not honest. So he decides to become honest, and then he becomes even more successful. Right.The premise is not credible, and therefore the book is not believable.Arnold Brown"
5,I'll think of a reson later,"This is a song that is so carefully crafted and performed that you don't think there's not a word out of place-rather you think there's not a syllable out of place. if this song doesn't go #1, there's something wrong with the machine. The rest of the album is worth the money-that song is the product of the year. Thank Nashville that it got into the right hands."
2,Some scary scenes + outrageously sloppy impersonation = it's like a show based on comic books,"Some scenes are thrilling such as the one when the female ghost killed a man in his car in Pilot (Disc 1, episode 1). What annoys me the most is the sloppy impersonation carried out by the two brothers (main characters) in the show. In all 4 episodes of disc 1, they impersonated all kinds of people such as FBI agents, ATF, etc. They even used fake credit cards! And all they got was a slap on their wrists! This makes the show more like a comic book. Many times, it's so illogical that it's silly funny! There's no seriousness at all.The qualities are not even. Only 2 out of 4 episodes of disc 1 have some frightening moments. They're Pilot, and Phantom TravelerI finished watching only disc 1 of season 1. I did not watch the others because it's more like a horror comedy to me. This show worth watching once to satisfy your curiosity"
2,A lost opportunity,"A great premise, a bad show. This was given an opportunity to have a great main plot thread (like the aliens in x-files) and also the variety of threats appearing on each different episode. Plus, it would have filled an, unless I am mistaken, otherwise empty niche. But it failed. Why? Well, for sure its not because of lack of presence of the 2 main characters. It was bad directing and bad writing. Shame...."
3,The DVD has no English subtitles,"Love this show. No complaints about the content but the DVDs themselves have NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. There is only Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and spoken English."
1,under rated well writen and 1st rate acting,"well i bought this series and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is brillantly written, the acting is 1st class,and the actors of a standard that rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do mean they score higher than ten. i can understand its five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it out shines them all.If i could i would rate it 10 stars.if there is a secound series i will be buying it."
1,Try Super Stupid......,"This is another really stupid series that we have the CW to thank for being on.It's long, tedious, has no acting or point to it, and is nothing but more unhealthy cult entertainment."
5,Supernatural - The Complete First Season,I really love the Supernatural complete first season. It one of my favorite shows that I prefer to watch. Right along with Smallville which I got all of Smallville's complete season. I can't wait for the second complete season of Supernatural comes out. For I'll purchase it along with all of their complete season when they're available and the reason I purchased the first complete season of Supernatural that I can see the shows that I possibly missed while it was on TV
5,Supernatural Tv Series Still Exist,Not since buffy or angel I would never thought another series like this would be better and Supernatural is Better and love the slap stick humor also.
5,Too scared to sleep.....,"Oh my gosh....my boyfriend and I discovered this show on a local tv station November 2007. After watching the 3rd season we had to look it up and buy the first season. This is the best show either of us have seen in long time. Watching it on dvd is like watching a 20+ hour movie.It's full of urban legends, spooky stories and has a sense of humor. The cast is beyond excellent - especially Jared and Jensen as Sam and Dean...wow...you guys really make me believe that you are brothers. The writing is terrific...the directors are incredible. Everyone involved with making this series deserves to win awards. I have to say that this is my favorite show of all time and we are going to buy the other seasons. We hope this series will continue for many years to come and we wish we could give you more than 5 stars."
1,AVOID,really boring extremly bad just talking i putone star because i have no choice because it would be zero
4,Good Alt/Pop Chops!,I stumbled across this CD because the price. Not unlike some music out there but a little different too. A very good pop cd that is a good listen. And as you can buy it for $.01 on Amazon a No Brainer! Enjoy ;-)
1,James Dean Story overdone/... inthe 50s,"The background music & narration were 50's, coming across overly dramatic & by today's standards, stupid. Very dated & funny where it shouldn't have been funny. Should be updated by something a little more timely."
4,The most underrated band of all time,"This newest album by Knapsack will probably go by overlooked by mass media critics as most of their albums have been. But, don't let that let you ignore it. This album is full of lush melodies and harmonies ala Jawbreaker, Samiam and Jimmy Eat World. From opening track ""Katherine teh Grateful"" on to the end, you can hear the passion and honesty in the lyrics and the depth of their music. The fact that the album was produced by Mark Trombino doesn't hurt them either. Mark's a genious knob-twiddler that can make emotional magic happen for a band in the studio. Get this album, listen, rinse, repeat...."
2,Dissappointing; resultant Vedic chart not useful,"I was so disappointed. Not nearly as well organized, logically presented, or well-edited (no index either) as the author's ""The Complete Idiots Guide to Hinduism"" that I absolutely loved. Instruction sequence (and gaps) makes it difficult to complete even a simplistic Vedic chart. It has undefined terms, continual ""commercials"" for websites, unrealistic recommendations for daily practices, unabashed Anti-Republican political agenda, and poor examples of applying even a simplistic chart to real events of daily life. I SO loved the Hinduism book; I am so disappointed in this one. It's difficult to tell whether the author knows the topic and just had a poor editor and review feedback OR that she really doesn't know and is merely a believer in Hinduism trying to make a dime."
1,"Hmmmm, who wrote this?","I completely forgot reading this book until another Amazon reader wrote me with a question which jogged my memory. I read this book after finishing the complete dollanger collection. When I had previously read Garden of Shadows, I remember feeling as if the book had in no way been written by VC Andrews because of the wording and technique. Then when I started reading this book, the same feeling came over me again. I guessed the ending not too far into the book which is not usually the case when reading these books. I have to be honest. I found it boring and couldn't wait to finish it! Even my two teens who had both swiped the Flowers in the Attic series from me with delight, turned their backs on this book after a couple of chapters. I hope the rumor about a 'ghost writer' is not true. Read it yourself and see what you think!"
1,"love Charlie and Lola, but...","We love Charlie and Lola, and the book itself is very cute, however, when my daughter opened it for Christmas, it seemed like it had been used already. All the little pull tags were wrinkled and disconnected from the paper and Charlie's head was off. Also on the last page the planets were not connected. I don't know if this is a manufacturing problem or an Amazon problem. I have not found anywhere to ask this question...I don't think I can send it back as it has already been opened, but I do want Amazon to know I am disappointed in this item."
3,Okay.,"This video portrays the making of Bone thug's last album, ""BTNHResurrection,"" in a documentary. It also contains videos for a few tracks off the album, and a performance of ""Tha Crossroads.""The main problem with this item is that the tracking on the VHS is horrible. So if you truly want this, the DVD would be the better route to go.But it is worth picking up, for the documentary, as well as the extended version of the ""Change The World"" video, which is one of Bone's best videos to date."
3,"It was good, but it could be better","I've bought every single Chris Isaak album to date (including the ""Married to the Mob"" soundtrack!) I love Chris to death, but I'm sorry, he needs to hire a better lead guitarist. This guy is just not pulling his weight.I saw Chris play live again just a few months ago. Chris always gives it his all, and I enjoyed the show, but the leads were decidedly weak. Chris is a big enough draw that he should be able to employ top talent in his band.Two days later, I saw Dave Alvin and the Guilty Men play in a small club. Even though Dave is not a major headliner, he has absolutely outstanding musicians backing him up. They rocked the house until 2:00 in the morning. Best $10 I ever spent."
2,It's OK - not as good as Chugga Chugga Choo Choo,"I bought this expecting the same rhytmic verse as Chugga Chugga Choo Choo which we really enjoy reading. This book fell short and it is very choppy to read. However, the art is nice."
4,"Love the book, not this edition","My son loves this book, hence so do I. We read it every night. However, for a toddler his age (15 months), the board book he already had is much sturdier. We bought this one as a replacement in case the other one broke or got lost... That's how much he loves it. The first day we got it he got a paper cut in his finger, the next day he tore a page. It's adorable and bigger than the board book, just not age appropriate."
5,Best book ever for a little one who loves trucks!,"I had been searching for books for my two year old little boy who adores anything having to do with trucks, cars, buses etc. He loves to be read to but is pretty picky about the books he will actually sit through! He LOVED this book from the first time I read it to him and he brings it to me multiple times a day! Or... I will find him just sitting quietly ""reading"" it by himself! The illustrations are great (with a funny little story all to themselves about the bones the big truck was hauling slowly being taken throughout the book!) and the rhyming text is wonderful! The only thing I wish is that it came in a board book since I have had to tape a few small rips in the pages already from my son turning the pages too roughly. Other than that, I highly recommend this book to anyone with a little one with a love for all things with wheels!"
3,Slight Disappointment,"I had high expectations for this book based on other reviews and was disappointed. The ""simple rhymes"" were a bit awkward to read and not particularly funny. My 3 1/2 year old son (who loves trucks) enjoyed the pictures but quickly lost interest after only a few reads. In my opinion, this book is not in the same league as ""Duck in the Truck."""
3,"Dated, but interesting from a historical perspective","Dated content, but interesting for historical perspective of religion comparisons. Mostly 'western' religion comparison. For free, so nothing to complain about."
5,hypnotic,"You can't go wrong purchasing any Archers of Loaf album. There's a depth to the recording that encourages me to listen to it again and again. Archers of Loaf didn't reproduce an ""Icky Mettle"" sound on release after release. How bored would I be? How sucky would that be? If I want to rock out, I listen to ""Icky Mettle"" or ""Vee Vee"" or ""The Speed of Cattle"". With bands like that, you only NEED to buy one album for your collection. This isn't AC/DC or Jackyl. I suggest you buy ALL the Archers of Loaf albums. NO, I INSIST!!! That's what makes this band great. You will like them ALL. Don't overthink this, just buy them and listen to them. You don't need to RANK them."
4,The soul of the American pragmatic spirit,"For many this is this Letter of advice from Franklin to his son is the perfect embodiment of wisdom of American business success. For D.H.Lawrence however it showed the 'shop-keeping ' lack of soul, of Franklin and he mocked him in his 'Classic Studies on American Literature'.In this work Franklin creates and promotes the legend of himself. He is a great inventor, a fabulous pragmatist. He also tells the story of his own rise , and shows how hard work and going through times of difficulty with determination and strength are important.The work contains much of the kind of pithy wisdom Franklin made himself known with in America through 'Poor Richard's Almanac'It is not a full biography, and it of course omits many other sides of the mind and character of this complex genius."
1,65 tiny tiny stickers - deceptive picture and ad,"From looking at the picture and the title ""sticker roll"" you would expect 65 stickers that are round and of reasonable size. Instead, the top is a single sticker and the 'roll' is a single panel of many tiny stickers.I had purchased these to help decorate a b-day party - needless to say, not useful in the least and very expensive especially after shipping costs. Save your $$ and time."
4,The Knitted Farmyard,"Lovely book, but all the content I already had in Messent's book on knitting fantasy. I will pass this on to a friend as a gift."
3,Hooked not knitted??,"I guess I missed something. I thought the whole farmyard was knitted. However, the whole farmyard playmat is rug hooked not knitted. All of the buildings, people and animals are knitted, but the foundation is not. I was specifically looking for some ideas & patterns for the play mat. Grrr.The people & animals are cute but I am NOT going to learn how to hook rugs for one project. The photos in the book are beautiful. Haven't worked on a pattern yet to rate that.If you are looking for a knitted farmyard MAT look at Living Crafts magazine - 1st issue. I love that pattern but was trying to find a few more ideas to add to it."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"If it were possible for a movie to be rated negative five stars, I'd do it. This was so far past awful, you couldn't even see awful from where this movie was.I had high hopes for the movie since I like many of the people in it. However, the writing is so bad that the talent can't do anything with it.The collection of acting talent, unfortunately, is no more able to become a good movie than a heap of building materials is able to become a house."
3,Cronenberg's History is Better Than This,"I've got no problem with movie violence and there is plenty of rapid fire,neck breaking, high adreniline nastiness here. Well filmed and seemingly full of trhills and promise, this film falls in that it kills off the notable antagonists before we get to develop a good hatred for them,then adding insult to injury, director Cronenberg barely explains it at all with a convoluted real identity/past life yarn.Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall,a mild mannered diner owner in small town Indiana who's quiet life unravels after a violent confrontation with two armed robbers.Maria Bello wins as Mortensens sexy wife,Ed Harris places with a good faux Philly mob accent, John Hurt shows up but delivers a very unimpressive role as a heavyweight."
2,This movie fails mainly because of dialogue,The dialogue in this movie is very very dull. Its like the characters in this movie don't know what to say. Tom and Edie Stall are supposed to be a couple that has been married for 20 years? Joey and Richey Cusack are supposed to be brothers? Leland and Billy are supposed to be partners in crime? Jack and Tom Stall are supposed to be father and son? The dialogue isn't real or imaginative; just bad (or the opposite of original).
1,Don't waste your time,"The acting in this movie was just plain bad. I am a big fan of Viggo Mortenson, which is why I saw this movie, but the storyline just dragged and left me depressed; I still love you, Viggo."
2,"Too simple, dont really care for the characters","I was disappointed with this film, very messy direction and misplaced scenes. If you really p*ssed the mob off they would just come and whack you(at least according to most mob involved movies). Contained token subplot I would expect of a straight to video release that had no context in the movie. This movie had no identity if that makes any sense. One Sopranos episodeeasily beats this film hands down and doesnt rely on gore or full frontal nudity for cheap thrills. Good films rely on good casting. Had me hanging in to the end for the wrong reason, I was expecting something amazing to happen, all a waste of time. Expected better from this director. Save your time and give this one a miss."
2,Dissapointing,"I was really waiting to see this movie when it came to dvd cause I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters. I heard everyone say how great it was, so I figured it must be really good...I was wrong. This movie was a big let down, from the very awkward rape scene to the stupid ending. I just don't know what these other critics are seeing. I would have liked the movie 10 times more if the story was about tom and his family being part of the witness protection program. I just thought the whole thing with him trying to get himself outta the mob was lame. The only really good thing about this movie was william hurt, who had the best lines in the whole movie. But, other than that...the movie was lame."
1,So Weird...,"I was so excited about seeing this movie. It was so bad. The plot was ridiculous, the over-the-top sex was unnecessary. When the credits starting rolling at the end I sat there wondering what I had just watched. Silly is the word that comes to mind."
2,"Good Performances, Very Stupid Plot","I will say the performances in this movie, particularly by Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt are excellent. But c'mon, this movie is absurd. First, how can a ""hitman"" who has been out of commission for nearly 20 years somehow remember all these moves and execute them perfectly without a training regimine that would create at least some suspicion among his family?! Give me a break. This movie is ridiculous."
3,A Decent Film,"I haven't always liked David Cronenberg's work in the past, but this is a decent little film. My advice to any potential viewers would be to try to not learn too much about the plotline before seeing it as that really could spoil things.Although the film does show slightly too much gore for my tastes, it is nicely done and William Hurt gives an outstanding performance - certainly one of the most unique of his career."
4,1 word... Exciting!!,"Although Tom Stall appears to have a happy/ normal life with his close family, he actually has a violent history he is running from made known after becoming a local hero. This effects his life dramatically and now he must make things right.The story line in A History of Violence is downright awesome, mostly because Mortensons character is such a likeable guy you want to see him successful which definitly keeps you tuned into the movie. Also, great fight scenes and sex scenes will aid in keeping your interest peeked."
2,"Bad premise, but thought provoking","Willing suspension of disbelief is pushed to the limits in this movie. One has to believe that the cops can't put all these deaths together. One has to believe that twenty years of clean living make up for being a sociopathic murderer. When the movie ended it took a minute for me to realize how much the movie was manipulating me, wanting me to sympathize or even just empathize with this character, just because he wanted to be good. Well, just unlock all the prison doors, 'cause those guys are going straight! Honest! And one last gripe - I don't understand the necessity of the graphic oral sex scene. Luckily I was watching with my husband, because if it had been anyone else, I would have been uncomfortable, and I'm no prude. I give it two stars instead of one because it has made me think about our justice system, and punishment in our society. Any movie that makes me consider issues has at least some value."
4,I Expected More But It's Still Good,Too many times I've watched a movie expecting greatness and not getting that. I just knew A History Of Violence would be good but it only met some of my expectations. Although it will keep you entertained you might get mad at it lacking some realness. It may look real but trust me it doesn't look real enough and it goes on for the entire movie. For example when Tom saves his diner and the people in it he hits one of the robbers in the face with a pot of coffee and it's so obvious it's digitalized. Besides that and some other unneeded scenes this film is very good and it ends very well with a nice shootout. Viggo does very well with the fight scenes and gives you a lot of action without gun play. He plays this role really good because he makes you believe he's Tom that other guy.
1,2nd Worst Movie Ever,"The first worst movie ever is clearly 'Bottom Feeders' (1998). Underdeveloped characters, contrived dialogues, absurd sex scenes, and a complete lack of creativity yield a predictably lame movie. If you want to see a decent movie with the exact same plot, check out 'High Crimes' (2002) with Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman."
3,Very good movie but kind of short,Only an hour and a half so I has hoping for more Viggo to see.I would recommend.
2,one of the worst movies...,...New Line could ever offer...and im serious about that... i HATED this movie!!!and the ending was HORRIBLE!!!is in the top 10 worst movies of all years!!!!definately a waste of time... and money.
1,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"First, let me state that the acting was wonderful, but a movie is only as good as the Director allows it to be.That being said, I felt somewhat let down by this movie. It was slow and to me seemed as if some editor got cut happy leaving you with a bunch of small scenes that seem to orbit around their own sun in separate solar systems. I was also disappointed that they felt it necessary to drag out the sex scenes the way they did. I am not a prude by any means but they just seemed disconnected and over the top.I am very sorry that this movie was not put together better - it took the admirable acting talents of the cast, wadded them up and threw them in the trash, along with the $19.99 I spent for the DVD."
3,Above average production for a TV movie,"A new kind of virus breaks out at three different places simultaneously, each part of the U.S. military. In Germany, Mira Sorvino is working undercover buying a vial of a virus. When her own people try to kill her, she goes underground to find out why. Stephen Dorff is an ex covert agent now working as a medical researcher. He starts out investigating the viral outbreak, but is eventually pulled back into black ops work to find out where the virus came from and who tried to kill Sorvino.The Hades Factor is a good spy thriller, especially since it was made for television. It's a good looking film with an above average cast and obviously had a good sized budget. The story is interesting and the director keeps the action moving."
5,humanae vitae,"THIS LETTER WAS REJECTED BY MANY PEOPLE, SOME OF THEM CATHOLICS. HOWEVER, NOW, 43 YEARSLATER, IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS PROPHETIC. IT IS FULL OF PROJECTIONS OF HOW THE PHILOSOPHYBEHIND ARTIFICIAL CONTRACEPTION WOULD LEAD TO AN UTTER DISDAIN FOR PEOPLE'S LIVES,AND THESE THOUGHTS ARE VERIFIED TODAY BY OUR ABORTION-LOVING WAYS AND (IT'S ON THEWAY), EUTHANASIA. A TRULY TIMELESS WORK."
4,Great support,"I have a back injury while pregnant and was told by my Physical Therapist to get this support belt. It helps elevate some of the weight/pulling in my back do to my growing stomach. It is a little awkward to put on by myself, not sure if that is do to my back injury or the way the belt is made so it didn't get the full 5 stars. I find the belt easier to use when my husband assist me in putting it on. I would recommend this belt for any pregnant women who is having back issues while pregnant."
5,Best Ever!!!,"this CD is very enjoyable and creative, no filler songs, all tracks are oringinal, sexy, entertaining and fun. Best $15 ever spent on a CD. A+"
5,Work awesome look good.,I bought these for those times we forgot to get a set from Chinese restaurants. They are fantastic. I have been washing by hand. Very comfortable to use. So far so good.
2,Comparison shopping,"This movie has two things in its favor (thus, my two* rating): 1. Great outdoor scenery (on the seldom-photographed Indian Ocean island of Reunion); 2. The opportunity to see both its stars (Deneuve and Belmondo) in their prime and without their shirts.Otherwise, forget it.The 2000 remake entitled Original Sin is less talky, more suspenseful, cheaper in cost (at least on Amazon), has an American (as opposed to a French) ending, and also features topless (and bottomless) stars (Jolie and Banderas). The novella to which both movies owe their inspiration, Waltz into Darkness (by the same guy who wrote Rear Window), is better than either movie, and has the best ending (truly noir) of all. All three versions require a definite suspension of disbelief. As a couple other reviewers of one or the other of the movie versions asked: ""How could anybody (i.e., the Belmondo/Banderas character) be so dumb?"""
4,Some Mermaids are Poisonous,"This is another Belmondo adventure with our hero having to first wake up and then catch up with a beautiful adventureness, in this case a young Catherine DeNeuve. Fans will recognize the house in the snow suspiciously similar to the house in Shoot the Piano Player."
4,An Australian master,"I, like many, have been a fan of Peter Goldsworthy since 'Maestro,' and Three Dog Night did not disappoint. This is by no means an easy read, and it does tackle some difficult issues, issues to which some readers might take offence (see previous review). But to me, Goldsworthy's insight into his characters is the work of someone who is a master of their craft. His depiction of the Australian landscape is superb, and his prose, to me, is something to be admired.Goldsworthy is one of those Australian novelists whose books I always look for as soon as they are released - like Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Peter Carey."
1,Strangely still and static.,"There's not much interaction between the characters in this long slow-moving novel. The heroine, who is mute and deaf after an early childhood trauma, is cut off from her world to such an extent that the novel lacks all immediacy. Too bad, because the descriptive prose about Sicily is interesting; there's just a great lack of emotion."
5,The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Collectible,"I ordered this book for a Christmas present and just now ordered another one for another friend for a Christmas present as well, because of the excellent response in receiving the book (in two days!) also the packaging was wonderful and the condition of the book absolutely beautiful!! I would highly recommend Kristines book alley and will use them again, well, already did..smile. Claire"
3,It's a book.,"We didn't actually read this book. It was a donation for a library. We were happy to help. We've read other Shakespeare compilations tho, and even tho they are hard to understand (given the Elizabethan English), once you start... you can't stop! Good soap opera!"
3,"You can do better than that, mate","Steve Hackett was a brilliant member of Genesis in the 70's, and his chops were second to none. However on this album he's made a fatal mistake: vocals. Rather than embrace and improve upon vocals, he has apparently considered them unimportant. John Wetton has a tragic disinterest in the world as he drones the words without passion. Wetton seems to wake up on the occasional Asia tune, otherwise he appears bored beyond words to describe. Special effects for the vocals that Peter Gabriel would embrace are also uninspired. Brilliant 5 star music, brilliantly executed, except that the Wetton 2 star vocals crash the entire project. Worth having? Yes! Just adjust your expectations for the bored vocalist."
3,"Great Album, Truly Awful Remastering!","There is no denying that this is one of the greatest albums ever released in the history of popular music. The brilliant Sad Eyed Lady Of the Lowlands is worth the price of admission alone. I will not go into any detail with regards to the individual songs on this album, as others have said all that needs to be said and also much more eloquently than I ever could. The fault with this double disc lies not with the music but with the remastering. I do not have the luxury of owning SACD or 5.1 Surround Sound so I am unable to comment on these particular layers, but I can say that the CD layer is just awful. It sounds as if it has been recorded in a tin can. Be sure to have a pair of earplugs close at hand as those harmonica breaks are piercing! And where is Al Kooper's lovely organ work? It has been buried so far in the mix that it is barely audible on some tracks. Let the buyer beware!"
5,masterpiece...,"One of Dylan's finest, if not the finest in his vast discography. Blonde on Blonde covers more ground than ANY rock musician had up to that point (or after that, for that matter). What else can be said about an album that has the hilarious Rainy Day Women 12 and 35, the gorgeous Visions of Johanna and the biting love-gone-bad of Just Like A Woman? If you don't already have it, do yourself a favor and buy it!"
3,Pretty good for its time,"Given that most people who listen to Dylan consider him one of the cornerstones of Western Civilization, this review is for those people who don't care anything about that. This review is aimed at those who just have an interest in music of the mid 60s but have no need to worship anyone. Most of these songs are pretty good and he actually sings on a couple of them. Six of the songs should have been left off and he definitely should have hired a better harmonica player. Yeah, I said it."
5,Finally!,"This is the way to get Blonde on Blonde on compact disc. The original CD release boasted not only ugly, incomplete packaging, but pretty flat sound. This one sounds exactly like it should, and it comes in a miniature version of the original vinyl sleeve. Not to mention that this is one of Dylan's finest albums, his best (and most surreal) stab at folk rock and electric blues. Get it."
4,Woulda made a great single album,"Some great songs here ""I Want You,"" ""Just Like a Woman,"" ""Rainy day Women,"" and ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,"" some good ones ""Absolutely Sweet Marie,"" and ""Leopard-Skin Pill-box Hat,"" and some Ok ones ""Visions of Johanna,"" and ""One of Us Must Know."" But one whole side of ""Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands"" is overkill. ""Temporary Like Achilles"" is just a re-write of ""It Takes A lot to Laugh"" from Highway 61, 4th Time Around"" is an unfunny, musically tedious parody of the Beatles ""Norewgian Wood,"" and a couple of songs are just filler, ""Pledging My Time"" and ""Obviously 5 Believers."" This could've been a killer single album. But the best of this is as good as Dylan gets."
5,"It's good, but there's a multi-channel version coming soon","I recently purchased this SACD because it's one of my favorite albums. It's a very faithful reproduction of the stereo edition of Blonde on Blonde. However, Sony has recently announced that a revised hybrid SACD version will be coming in ""mid-summer"" with both stereo SACD and multi-channel SACD.As such, this disc is on the verge of redundancy and potential buyers should be cognisant of this when making purchasing decisions.EDIT - More on the SACD hybridThis disc (along with 14 other Dylan titles) will be coming to hybrid SACD on 16 September. The new hybrid will retain the original stereo SACD mix but also include a conventional CD version of the mix and a new multi-channel mix.To sample Stuck Inside of Mobile, pick up the limited edition version of the Masked and Anonymous CD. It's actually a hybrid SACD with a sampler of the forthcoming reissues."
5,Stunning,"To put it briefly, this is Dylan's best album and has, in my opinion, the greatest somg ever written: Visions of Johanna."
5,Ephimeral. Music can not be better than this.,"Blonde on Blonde in the greatest work of the greatest single musician the world has ever known. There are so many layers of meaning and the musicianship is so dense that it has taken me two or three years to fully appreciate what is at work on this album. Blonde on Blonde is an album you grow with. Each time you listen to it, you gain new insight into what the poet is trying to say, or you filter out one particular instument out of the mix that you've never noticed before and it blows your mind. Highway 61 Revisited is catchier and Blood on the Tracks is easier to listen to, but niether approach the complexity and perfection that makes up Blonde on Blonde. It is impossible to do this album justice with words. Get it. Listen to it."
2,I was disappointed.,"Unlike other listeners, I did not enjoy this CD. In fact, it made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't help but wish for Mr. Bennett to be singing his own standards.I've seen Jack Jones in person and have fallen for his cool charm, but he just doesn't deliver the goods in this attempt.Sorry."
2,This is a fairly decent jazz cd,"This is the first jazz cd that I have ever heard Jack do. I think he did a good job as far as his singing goes. I liked the song selection and Jacks' interpretation of the lyrics.The problem I had with this cd was that some of the arrangements I thought didn't work. I felt like this area could have been better. His pianist Mike Renzi, I thought, had a good touch on the piano keys.I think most people will want to own this cd. Please enjoy!"
1,Everything is a Present: Wonder & Grace of Alice Sommer Hertz,I bought this DVD after a great writeup in the Sydney Morning Herald of this wonderful lady who still plays the piano and puts on lipstick every day even though she is in her 80's or 90's. However the DVD didn't bring out all her personal details and was quite expensive for what it was.
2,Most difficult game ever made,"I bought this game because of one reason. I love Final Fantasy Tactics. Hoshigame does share many elements in FFT, but this game is extremely difficult. In FFT, I level up some of my characters to 99, and breeze through the game. But you can't do the same in Hoshigami. Enemies in this game are at same level as your highest level character. Above that, your facing two to one, or three to one odds. This game is so hard that I had given up. I had never reset so many times in a game since FFT. Hoshigami could have been one of the greatest title if it wasn't so difficult. I would only recommend this game only if you have enormous amount of free time and a hardcore strategy gamer. You can only beat this game if your'e an expert on strategy games. Which I'm not."
3,Just all right,"Calder is my favorite artist ever. This book captures many of his different styles of works, but it needs photos of his standing mobiles, such as Little Parasite. The book has only a couple photos of unspectacular standing mobiles."
3,I really dont like this book to tell you the truth.,To tell you the truth I really dont like this book because they kill bulls.See I really dont like bulls but I dont like killing eather so I dont like this book.Please if you dont like killing dont read this.
4,an interesting read,"Shadow of a Bull is a Newbery winning book written by Maia Wojciechowska.It's about a boy, Manolo Olivar, son of Juan Olivar, the best bullfighter in Spain. But, Manolo is afraid of bulls; he thinks bullfighting is cruel to bulls. Manolo has to fight his first bull at eleven. Everybody expects him to be as good a bullfighter as Juan Olivar, but Manolo's a coward, and he knows it.This book contains many Spanish bullfighting terms. This story is well written and always fascinating and interesting. This book often makes you think what you would do if you were Manolo and in his circumstances. When it is time for Manolo to fight his first bull, it is exciting, gripping, and intense.Overall, this is a wonderful book and I give it four-and-a-half stars."
1,Stick to brands you know,"My camera is a HP 935 Photosmart, 5.3 MP....etc.Im not quite sure how this happens, but the camera wouldn't turn on with the card inserted. Then it wouldn't turn off till I took it out.Since returning it, I have bought a Sandisk 512 MB card .....AAAHHHHH, working perfectly now. Maybe I received a damaged card...or not. My advice is to stick to a brand you know."
4,It Reminded Me of Me,"If I had not read Await Your Reply first, I probably would have rated this higher, but it did not quite measure up to that very high standard. Still, it was a very, very good book. Almost twelve hours after I have finished reading it, I am still shook up over the last chapter. I feel I may always be shook up over it. Although it did not induce the mouth-gaping moments that Await Your Reply created and I guessed correctly early on regarding one of the biggest plot points, it did have plenty of twists, turns and gut-wrenching moments.While this book may not have measured up overall to Await Your Reply, it did in some ways surpass it. I think this book will stick with me longer and make me reflect more on my own life: past, present and future. While some of the details of Await Your Reply are starting to fade from my memory after six months, I suspect that this book may last a lifetime.Maybe that is because it reminds me of me."
3,You remind me of me,"This book is full of depressing adventures that are sort of believable. I mean, some people do have a sucky life. This book is about generations of crap happening to the same family. Almost like saying if your daddy is a drug dealer, then most likely growing up in that situation, his kids will be too. This book is about Nora Doyle, and her son's Jonah and Troy. The boy's have a drug dealer father, who is a total loser. Nora is depressed, and suicidal. Written by Dan Chaon. It's hard to explain this book. Either you love it, or you don't. Although this book was dark, there's lessons to learn. This book is kind of depressing because it seems they just can't see daylight. Also, the characters jump around so much in the book at first, it's hard to bond to any one character. It does all fit together once you get to the end though. This book is worth reading and I do recommend you read it at least once."
1,Not Good,"This story bored the dickens out of me. The writing dragged on and on about subjects which were uninteresting and depressing. I agree wholeheartedly with R. Farmer. I am not a Pollyanna who only needs sunshine and smiley faces, but this was ridiculous. The characters were stuck in boring places with no desire to make things better for themselves. Talk but no action."
4,"Exquisite, Haunting Novel...","I had to consume this book in small bites rather my usual all-consuming ""non-stop"" style. I agree with the other reviewers that this author writes with an absolutely luminous style that transcends the hopeless and regret-filled lives of his characters. But I often felt mired in the quicksand of their lives, and struggled at times to find a reason to continue reading after yet another disappointment or dream unfulfilled. It isn't an easy book to read - either emotionally or structurally because of the author's style of moving forward and backward in the characters lives. Luckily he puts the dates at the beginning of each chapter , making it a bit easier to orient the reader as the story weaves between the characters. This book will undoubtedly be considered for many major awards - and the characters will linger in my memory in the days and weeks to come."
1,what a rip!,WHAT A RIP!Picture makes it look like you are getting bottles (vial) when they are actually just half pieces of plastic with paper backing! You can't reclose the perfume after you try it! I am really disappointed. Save your money and get a larger sample that you can ACTUALLY USE!
1,I wasted my money on this one :(,"I hate to leave such a negative review, but it seems all this author did was take the information presented in ""The E-Myth"" by Michael Gerber, and make it her own (and in an amateurish way to boot!).If you are a business owner who really wants to learn how to create systems so your company runs without you, then get the latest edition of ""The E-Myth Revisited"" and let a true pro show you the way."
1,Buy E-myth Revised instead,The book E-myth Revised covers more information and is 1/3 the price of this book. Maybe buy this book if you don't understand E-myth and just need it explained to you in different words. Very dissappointed and thought this was a waste of money.
3,"Ok Story, Talent Wasted","Never having read the original book, I won't comment on how this version compares to the actual story. Morgan Freeman gives a fine, if somewhat bored-looking performance, and the storyline is interesting, if not terribly inspired.The reason I (and likely many others) bought this film is because it contains the last film performance given by Jeremy Brett prior to his untimely death. Unfortunately, Brett's talents were wasted in this film - the man has only about a minute of screen time in an inconsequential role. Although his illness prevented him doing more, the question is why Brett bothered at all. Such a role is nearly an outrage for the man who gave us the definitive portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.Not a bad film, but not outstanding either. Good for Freeman, too bad about Brett."
3,Moll gets a bun in the oven,"Do you remember Rizzo from Grease? Stockard Channing? Here she is a madam who sells young Moll Flanders's virginity to an old goat. Come on Rizzo. But she is quite useful in the end. Moll Flanders is abused from the start, but ends up on top, so don't be afraid to watch the many perils and mishaps of Moll Flanders."
3,Watch the Alex Kingston version and then decide!,"Although this was not a bad movie, it is a horrible adaptation of the book. It really only touches on a couple of the situations that Moll gets into. If you really want to see a fiery and sexy Moll Flanders buy the Mobile Masterpiece Version that stars Alex Kingston of ""ER"". It is MUCH better!"
5,great!,I just used this book in my kindergarten classroom and they loved it! What a great way to introduce the abs's! The children really enjoyed looking for all of the pictures!
5,This book may become your child's favorite....,"The illustrations are detailed and helps your child to soound out letter soounds, along with searching throughout the page for everything that begins with A,B,C etc...Which can be challenging for mom and dad too. There is a key in the back to assist you. In other words, this book is fun for your child and the parent. Which is good, because don't be surprised when SHADOWBOXES becomes your child's most requested book. I just wish I coould get some of the pages in poster size."
3,Easy reference guide for conversation,An older booklet for which Amazon charges three times the cover price is a good reference for conversational Spanish and small enough for taking with you.
2,Just the basics,"I found The Easy Spanish Phrase Book a bit outdated with the suggested phrases. I purchased it along with the Merriam Spanish-English Dictionary hoping they would partner in a more affective way. I had hoped it would be more helpful, but truthfully it felt like I was in the dark ages of travel with some of the phrases choosen to translate. It's in great need of updating."
5,wow!,"Wow, This book is such a great value! I mean, If this book was priced at $12.99, it STILL would be a great value, but for $1.50, It's shocking. This book tell you how to speak basic spanish. The index is usefull incase you need to look up a certain word, for example '' window'', Just go to the index and they will give you a sentecnce and the word window in spanish. Great book and I recomend it to anyone who isn't very fluent in spanish and needs some help. This would be good for students who take spanish in school, it would be great with homework. I would suggest you buy this book before the price increases."
2,Not very useful for spanish class,"Sorry, but this just was not very useful for me. It was like $2, but a waste of my money. Didn't use it at all for my spanish class. I really don't recommend it if you are using it for a spanish class."
3,Not a good one for Kindle,"This is a fine, useful book, and certainly very affordable, but for me, language books and cookbooks are 2 categories that I just don't like in ebook form. When I'm learning a language, I frequently need to back up and review something that came long before--it's just not that easy on Kindle. Also, one complaint I have about this and other 'fast-learning' Spanish books, while there is ample practice on how to ask questions, less attention is paid to how to understand all the possible answers you may get to those questions. That said, it covers many different travel situations, and I have learned from it."
4,Starting out on the learning path of Spangish!?!,I know very little spanish and this book is a help in learning some phrases and asking some questions. It is very basic and helpful. Thank you!
4,spanish book,nice book this book is easy to understand and easy to learn phrases from. i could easily learn to talk in spanish.
4,Great phrase book,"I found this book to be a simple and basic introduction to Spanish words, pronunciation, and everyday phrases. The book is basic and userfriendly. However, it does not perform miracles - my Spanish phrases are still fragmentary at best."
5,"Indispensable & compact. And unbelievably, under a dollar!","This book was indispensable and it fit right in my backpack. I used this book, the Menu-Master for Spain and the Chile guide by Youman and Estep. These three were all I needed for two weeks in Chile."
3,Look but do not touch!,"My son loves Legos but if you're buying this for a child who actually wants to play with it, you'd better be prepared to fix it on a regular basis. For example, the movable ""head"" is attached to the body at the neck with ONE of their common pegs. This isn't one of those pieces that snaps and locks into position, rather, it's a press fit that is easily loosened by the slightest manipulation. That's just one example. There are many more. After spending the better part of the day after Christmas putting it together, I'm pretty disappointed with the prospect of partially reassembling it over and over again. Oh well, what do you expect for $100?"
1,NOPE.,"Don't put this on any rifle you intend to hit anything with. Will not hold zero. It's just a poor design. There ARE receiver cover rail mounts that work well, but this is not it. Texas Weapon Systems makes a great one for about $130 but you won't find it here. This might be a good option for an air soft AK, but if you are going to use a REAL rifle with REAL recoil and intend to shoot it MORE THAN ONCE find something else. NcStar is for toys, I've tried several of their accessories and consistently found them to be useless crap in the real world."
1,This Is Junk. Get a siderail.,"I'm not going to go into a 1000 word rant. I'm going to keep it short, honest and to the point. The 2 screws that are supposed to hold it tight strip out the stamped, that's right I said STAMPED screw holes before it even gets remotely tight enough to keep optics zeroed. They just punched a couple of holes in the rear and threaded them. If there were nuts brazed or tacked under the mount it may be a decent product but as is, they are worthless crap. Save your money and get one of the other mounting options because this one sucks. Any cover that mounts this way is crap. NC makes some good stuff but this is not one of them."
2,falls apart,"There was some modification needed to make it fit on my chinese norinco ak. The rear screws to tighten the cover need to be lossened for removal. I left those screws off the first time I went shooting and the cover moves around a bit. The cover gave me a scare because I removed the mag on the AK and a small part fell out the gun I freaked a bit trying to figure out what it was, turns out its one of the nuts tacked on the dust cover. I dont recomend this cover."
2,fits but thats it,"It was a hair to long so I filed it down just a hair and it fit but thats about it. After installing, it is pretty sloppy, you must tighten screws which means that it will be almost impossible for any sights to retain zero after you have to clean it. It looks good but dont think I will leave it on. I am going to get a side mount that was meant for these guns."
1,Ak Receiver Tri-Rail Weaver scope mount,This iteam was absolute junk. I own a romanian Ak and it did not fit at all.I dont know about you but its pretty crappy when you get instructions that you might have to modifiy the iteam you just purchased.I would not recommend this iteam very cheap and not worth the trouble.
4,great deal,Overall I am happy with this purchase. I had to do a little modification in the form of some filing but nothing major.
1,"unless you want a bloody nose, don't buy this","put it on my I.O AK, needed some filing in order to slide on my rifle as well as mounting my scope rings.right from the get-go, i had my doubts but i figured i'd give this product a shot.well after about 3 shots, i realized that the mount had come off and my scope was pointing high, hence the reason i couldn't see where my bullets were going. removed my scope but kept the receiver cover on to prevent smoke and stuff flying on my face. well after a few more rounds, the mount popped off and smoked me right in the nose, taking a chunk of skin off and made it bleed. i furiously emptied my clip down range, and threw this piece of sh** in the garbage."
3,The Rail worked with modification.,"The steel is much thiner than the steel you have on your gun now, it was abit out of shape. It had little screws in the back to snug it up so it wouldnt be so sloppy, i re-shaped the steel alittle with pliers and a vise and now it works great and doesnt need the screws. The paint on it is technicly black but it doesnt match a black gun at all, i taped off around the rail and painted it."
1,not for saiga 762 ak,didnt fit even after filing to try to make it fit waste of money should have got side mount rail
5,Better than I thought it would be.,This movie was a little bit before my time and if it wasn't for the fact that I had to watch this movie for school I would have never gotten the pleasure to watch it. The plot was excellent as well as everything else in the movie.
5,Well worth the money!,"Still my all time favorite movie, looks great in this release. The special features add a lot to this package especially where the actors, writers, directors do a running commentary throughout the entire length of the film. Incredible insights into the making of this and other movies of the era. Buy this instead of buying the movie only dvd. Pop some popcorn, grab you favorite beverage and get ready for a great evening of movie watching!"
5,Healing Hands of Time,I was very happy with the service. The album arrived a week before I tought it would. The albume is great. I am a Willie Nelson fan and this is a great album
4,A Summer To Remember,"I was sixteen,and just finished my grade school exams ( I belong to Bengal, in India) when I came across this exceptional book-I had read 'Shibumi', and 'The Main',both of which just bowled me over, and I had fallen in love with the style of Trevanian, a maestro de su genero, on every grounds! I fell in love with Katya, too--perhaps a little more than Jean Marc, who;s ideology made him a lovable character by his own rights--but my world became transmuted to darkness, in the oppressive summer afternoon, when I finished reading---I had grown up, and I was in love------the name Hortense, the name Katya----became the very centre of my being , at least for some time to come. A book exceptional in its poignancy, a must read for all lovers and madmen."
4,Just What I Was Looking For!,"I'm fascinated by different forms of divination as well as endlessly interested in food folklore. This little book covered both, along with so much more! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and look forward to putting the ideas in it to good use!"
4,Great read,"McEnroe not only captures his career, but his entire era - McEnroe, Connors, Borg, etc. His honesty is refreshing. This book together with Agassi's ""Open"" encompass most of the open era up until Federer-Nadal-Djoker. For players age 50+/-, a must read."
3,"an easy, pleasant, interesting read","This book by John McEnroe appears to be a pretty well thought out and balanced book. He seems to find a way to talk about the warts and all, even the good and very good parts. I enjoyed reading this and was always a McEnroe fan.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,tmj the real story,"I am a 36 yr. old female. I have been suffering with TMJ/DJD for a great many years - 22 to be exact. For the past 4 it's been hell. With four surgeries and 2 total reconstructions I am still living with horrid pain. When this book was recommened to me, I thought it would give me some answers. It did not. I was put off by how the chronic issue were not addressed. Surgery by an oral surgeon was not discussed. In my area of the country, dentists do not deal with TMJ, the oral surgeon is the main MD. Get your facts correct. The book was a waste of money."
2,Lethal Weapon Blu Ray Edition,"Bought this on sale, and was hoping this would include the extra scenes from the Directors Cut VHS and regular DVD releases. Well it does and doesn't. The menu has a section for additional scenes, but no choice to watch them in the flow of the movie. Also it's missing scenes from the directors cut, notably the scene where Riggs is dealing with the sniper. For a Blu Ray release this should have had all the bells and whistles that the directors cut regular DVD had. Now yet again we'll have to wait for another ""special edition"" version that will include the extras."
2,I LOVE Lethal Weapon...just not this copy.,"I'm a Blu-ray enthusiast, and a Lethal Weapon enthusiast. So, I was VERY disappointed in both the quality of the Blu-ray formatting for this (it looks like DVD quality), but what REALLY mad me upset is the fact that it's not the directors cut. I guess that perhaps it was a bit naive of me to assume that it would be, but come on, this is BLU-RAY we're talking about here! I was not impressed. Not to mention that the seller said it was in ""Good Condition"", but the spine and back of the sleeve was severely crumpled and torn. Had this been a good quality Blu-ray conversion, and it been the directors cut, I would have cared not regarding the crumpled sleeve. However, as it was not the case, the crumpled nature was the straw.P.S. I just checked on Amazon, and there's STILL no Director's Cut available. Until there is, I will not be buying any Lethal Weapon films on Blu-ray."
3,Despite the description this is not the Special Edition.,"This is strictly a review of the *technical aspects* of the Bluray version.The quality of the transfer to Bluray is so-so. The description on Amazon states this is the Special Edition which has the extra and frankly relevant footage cut from the theatrical. It doesn't.The audio is up to par but the transfer lacks the pop of a good session in the bay when it was done. Definitely tell this was not a ""hands on"" transfer.I don't remember if the original movie was 2:35:1 or not, but this Bluray version is 1:85. I know the rest of the series on Bluray is 2:35:1 so it's kind of a let down that it's missing from here."
3,Good 80's Cop movie,"Nothing amazing, but a good 80's movie. More serious than I remember. I think the other sequels being even better, more funny."
1,Don't buy this HD DVD Version,"I bought this HD Dvd version simply because I had spent heavily into HD dvd players;Toshiba(4 of them;no lectures please).I need as many HD dvd movies as possible just to make my purchases relevant(more the reason, because I live in Singapore).However, this disc is bad;nothing HD about it.Picture is sometimes ill defined and other times looks no better than an ordinary Dvd.Now that HD dvd is dead, wait for the Director's cut in Blu Ray."
1,HORRIBLE,"The benfit to this book is for someone who has never entered Manufacturing Mode in Pro/Engineer. It gives a light overview of NC Sequence types. The Exercise is to make a Plaque with Letters...This book lacks knowledge of interest to anyone with Pro/Engineer Design Experience. It does have enough information to Manufacture Parts or Organize your Process in a logical Fashion.Its not worth the 39.95. It lacks Pictures (Descriptive or Not) with the Lesson Material and the Exercises. The exercise parts are not realistic or useful to your learning.I would equate this book with a demo from PTC. Consider starting your manufacturing journey with a PTC course or Reading the PTC help. At least you learn the menu picks, the definitions, the process and work with exercises using curved surfaces."
2,Secret games 3,"The so called NR dvd you see above in not NR. If the racey seen were left intact, as in the true NR version, this movie is hot as it were intended by the producers. This R rated version is like watching an R rated version of a XXX movie. Totally worthless"
5,Awesome,"No time to say anything else, I'm off to the bookstore to get the next one.(Sorry Amazon, sometimes you just have to have something now.)"
4,Pretty darn amazing!,"This book is so good. A wonderfully inventive, enjoyable adventure. Endearing, unbelievable, and character-driven with a juicy plot. I can't add much to the reviews that have already been written. But Phedre was a surprising heroine indeed.My only con: the fabricated names for vikings (the skaldi), jews (yeshuites) and many other ethnic or racial groups was somewhat immature and annoying to me."
1,"Well, sado-masochists will love it...","....if you are not one of them, however, may I recommend something else? ANTHING else, in fact?There is something unduly sad about reading an author who might be a talented wordsmith if not for the fact that this is one long playout of her warped sexual fantasies. I don't demean or condemn this kind of literature; certainly it has its place among people who get off on scenes of cutting and abuse, rape and torture. How lovely. The involvement of children is quite disturbing to me personally, but again, I guess if you're into erotica, you will love this book. I just expect a little more high fantasy and less sexual leather fantasy from Tor. Perhaps they should rename the publishing house TORE."
2,Weird story,"Bad book- too much annoying go-at-it sex and violence, not enough of a real plotline to keep me interested, and how can any of you justify reading this book in public? It'll scare people. All three in the series have a chunky shirtless woman on the cover."
5,Kushiel's Dart,"I have to admit I was skeptical when it was compared to Dune. But it does not disappoint. Plan ahead to have plenty of spare time to read, because Carey has created a page turner."
5,"The Story of ""O"" meets Kim","This is a sumptuous, sensuous, sophisticated book; it's magnificent. Set in a beautifully-realized alternate history world with a truly interesting and workable theology, KUSHIEL'S DART is an intelligent erotic-political fantasy for adults. A marvelous, hate-to-put-it-down read."
2,I am underwhelmed,"Based on the ravishing reciews, I thought I was reading the new Great American Novel.Uh, no.It's certainly readable writing, and if you can stomach the sex, and the fact that the author uses S&M as her gimmick, than this book will probably fascinate you. It's a little like watching a train wreck at first; the first few instances can be seen as daring. After a while it gets old.Outside the sex there's little to recommend this book. I found the god imagery unimaginative and the character development lacking.I also want to know why Tor is marketing this as a debut, making everyone say, ""WOW! What a wonderful first book!"" when it's NOT."
2,bla!!!,"I kept seeing this book everywhere I went, it was always in the shelves of recommended/popular books so I figured I'd give it a try. I was terribly disappointed. While the story itself is entertaining and the world and culture Carey creates is fairly imaginative and beautiful, the language and narration describing it was bland. I kept reading solely to find out how the story would turn out. The narration felt distant and I had a really hard time caring about the characters. And for being a story about a courtesan in a society that is so open about sex, never was there a mention of birth control. We could have had a little more realism with a contraceptive ritual that would have fit in perfectly. But no, it's just a sex laden fairy tale."
1,not worth the time it took to write,"I love books... old, new, classic, modern... rare to find a written word not worth reading..Until now. Too many words describing nothing. The plots seems like it was thought of over a 12pk and as a way to link bad sex scenes.This is the unfortunate product that publishers are schlepping at us because we want sex and and something to make us feel like our own lives arn't that bad. The ONLY thing that is good about this compared to everything else coming from the fantasy genre is that is DOES NOT have vampires in it.There are some great historical novels out there that are worth every penny. Stick to those and save yourself from tedium."
1,0 stars for Ms. (Mary Sue) Carey,"I don't get the hype. It's wordy and flowery concoction of nothingness. Phèdre is little more than a Mary Sue wannabe. Mary Sue (Phèdre) does everything perfectly, says the right things, does the right things, and is in the right place at the right time at every turn of the book. The evil characters in this book fall all over themselves to get Mary Sue to bed and have a mind blowing (epiphany) orgasm, and is praised for giving them the best sex they ever had.I agree with the one brave reviewer who calls Ms. Carey on her over used flowery antiquated use of flat prose to describe a sex act, when the sex act is about BDSM. BDSM has nothing to do with romance or flowery prose.I hope the author will reimburse me not only for the 7.99 paid for the book, but for the 4 days that it took for me to read this badly written tripe."
4,"I like dry british humor, I think this is a hoot.","I haven't heard these cassettes, but I've read and reread all six books in this trilogy. I've always found them funny."
5,Favorite Trilogy,"Read it in 8 days, couldn't put it down. This edition contains 5 books of trilogy. Read it again, still loved it."
5,A very precise book,"This is a very good book. It is quite compact and does not waste time and pages on huge examples that would not make any sense at the end. The only issue, at least for me, is that it includes only the new features of the Sql Server. As a result if you are a beginner with SQL Server you need to buy an introductory book before you read this one."
5,The Tapping Solution - EFT,"I myself have tried EFT, and I can say that it works. This DVD is a must-have. Firstly, it shows you exactly how it should be done, secondly, you see for yourself the emotions come out of the people involved in this movie, and how it changes their life! Its quite moving, it actually brought tears to my eyes! We are not meant to suffer, and EFT is one easy solution that I find helps us heal from physical pain and mostly emotional blocks, which is why we get physical pain in the first place. It also helps with limiting beliefs and even just dealing with issues on a normal day to day life."
5,Tapping is amazing!,"I LOVE tapping. Every time I tap, I find healing within myself. Never has it been more helpful than losing my husband suddenly to brain cancer. I was told the day before he passed that he wouldn't make it through the night. Tapping helped me to keep releasing and be present with my experience. It's been 9 months now and I can honestly say, tapping has made the difference in how quickly I can shift my feelings. Thanks!"
2,"Not for me, and I'm a patient viewer","I don't mind slow-moving movies, or quiet, static stories (I was enthralled throughout by MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, for instance), but Babette's Feast did not stir me. I know that good acting may consist only of a silent glance, a raised eyebrow, a frozen gesture; but for me even these were lacking. Perhaps the author and director intended only for us to watch the isolated, inward, emotionally repressed community, and to reflect on its warning; but the movie did not imply or hint this. I'm sorry that I did not draw more from it."
3,"like french restaurants, this takes itself way too seriously","while two sisters grow old, their ""servant"" makes a big dinner. um, i know im not descibing it very well, but if youre interested enough to see this movie, youve probably already seen it."
4,not for beginners or inflexible people,"I'll start with the positive points of the video. I purchase this dvd because of the price. It was on $0.01+ S&H. Overall it was good for the money. There are eleven chapters and each has a different workout. Each workout uses the same actor in the same setup, a young woman in a gym. The young woman does the routine as the voice over explains. The music is calming and the voice over has a nice calming voice. I still gave this dvd high review because it is a great workout you can work up a sweat. Now for the negative points of the video. This dvd was too fast for me and I'm not as flexible as the actor. I think the dvd is older than 2001 as printed on the case, I think it may have been revised in 2001. If you look at you can clearly see."
5,Wally Cox was God,"This was a great early TV comedy. Wally Cox was Mr Peepers for several years, and this was the next series he had. Wally had wonderful comedic timing and this role seems made for him. Wally later became the voice of Underdog, and was on Hollywood Squares. This is well worth seeing, although it does NOT have the sexual references, violence and foul language so common in today's TV. It's just good clean fun."
5,Top 3 Best Gamma Ray Albums,"All 7 Gamma Ray albums are just amazing, it's soo hard to chose which one is best, but this one is on the top list. Also on the top 3 is probably Land of the Free, and Majestic. Each song is just amazing. Collect all the albums!"
3,In the middle on this one,"While I don't think this is a stinker neither will I be playing it all day long. I appreciate the authenticity of the sound but I wonder that the composers were so clinical in their expression. I kind of like the clanky tone, surely this is how it would have sounded live in a saloon or dance hall. I can also imagine the musician not having a long run on his gig without more emotion in his playing. If it's the only ragtime in your collection, well.... maybe this isn't the one; but if you're a collector of ragtime or the unusual, this is a must-have."
1,One more thing.,"Oh, and did I mention how loud it gets because of the vibration when you put it on a wooden desk?"
4,Good tackle box; some assembly required,"This is a good, large tackle box. As other reviewers have noted, it does not contain all of the internal storage compartments pictured and is brown, not grey. Also, the internal storage it does contain, both built into the box and the included removable containers, are not assembled - individual plastic tabs must be folded/cut and inserted into all of slots in order to create any compartmentalized storage. Not a huge deal, but a bit of a pain. All in all, satisfied. Holds all of my tackle with room to spare, and appears well made so far."
3,better look on internet than in life,not in perfect conditionI was upset to see some small scratches on items
2,A great handbook for a horrible class,"The handbook was great. It was detailed and built off of a rarely used class to give it lots of room to work with. It could have been done right. But the issues of power and balance were ignored.Compared to other classes the warrior starts powerful and grows weak. The mage and cleric starts weak and grows powerful. The necromancer starts very weak and grows godlike. The psionist starts powerful and grows godlike. THE PSIONISIST IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DM! The psionic spells (""abilities"") are more powerful than mage spells, they don't give one saving throws, and they go by a point system (giving a wider variety of spells, making them more powerful) This class unbalances everything. If you are a dm, don't let these characters in the game. My favorite world/campaign setting is dragonlance and I'm lucky because psionics don't exist on krynn! I found a reason to get rid of them! Woohoo"
2,Not for the beginner,"I'm building a sailboat, and being new to sailing, I was hoping this book would give me a fairly basic overview to rigging. Instead, this book is more a discussion for the intermediate or advanced sailor, who already understands rigging however is looking for a general discussion of best practices.I doubt this book would be of much use to the novice."
2,"""Pity, party of one?""","Kennedy belongs to the cult of victimhood. The book artlessly documents how her deliberate choices led to unwanted--but not surprising--results. She leaves college, employment, and marriage because she finds them banal. Declares it would ""be stupid to get pregnant"" when she isn't financially stable, yet goes off the Pill and has one child after another. A dreamer, not a doer, with delusions of grandeur, she only occasionally questions her actions. The title is a misnomer, and the book detracts from the plight of the real homeless without nets."
3,An interesting read,"I thought this was an interesting book. It is true that I felt she was naive and made many poor decisions. It did not seem to me that she wasn't in any dire straight and it was frustrating for me that she would not seek any financial assistance from her husband. However, it was good to know that she pulled herself out of homelessness without help (even though she actually `had a net'.) But, I did get the understanding that she is a loving mother because of her unwearied and tolerant ways toward her children. I got to see the intimacy that time can bring between a mother and her children. Selfishness is not what I witnessed. It takes strength and love to provide for your children and she took complete responsibility for them instead of shipping them away for someone else to take care of. She did the best SHE thought she could and it made for an interesting read."
5,It Can Happen to You,"I have just finished Michelle Kennedy's excellent memoir ""Without a Net"" and am planning on giving it to friends to read, especially the female ones. Bad decisions happen to everyone and Ms. Kennedy honestly writes about her bad decisions and how they led her and her 3 children to living out of their car. The United States, being a country that is wealthy, has just as many people who are hungry and ""living without a net"" and Ms. Kennedy writes a powerful story. For those of us with roofs over our heads and food on our tables, we should be extremely thankful."
3,I couldn't put it down!,"I waited 2 years for this book to come out! I read an excerpt from the book that was published in a magazine. Having kids myself and an unsteady income I could really see how someone like myself could become homeless. What I was dying to know was how she got out of it. Therefore, I was sorely disappointed when I got the book and learned that her way out was becoming pregnant and letting someone who had a crush on her take care of her.However, I couldn't put the book down. I read it in one day, staying up well into the night to finish it. Any book that has that effect is worth a read!"
2,A Cookbook For Writing HTML with Style,I bought the book hoping to learn how to create pop-up menus. I was disappointed in that respect. I did find it to be a nice guide for using style sheets for specific situations. Readers who do the homework and visit the companion website can pick up tips on getting things done. I would caution against doing everything shown. Many of the tricks require setting specific positions or heights or widths. Such tricks create pages that are not highly maintainable.
5,Top-shelf book on teams. A foundation text.,"Larson and LaFasto put their outstanding research into easy-to-understand language. The book is foundation reading for executives and team members who want to understand the key variables that spell success for teams. And it's an easy-reading 138 pages presented so anyone (5th grade reading level!) can understand their findings. I know the authors, and have the utmost respect for their scientific methodology and experience. We use the matching team/ leadership assessment and training program to help client organizations plan, build, and fix their teams. Really an excellent reader, and a foundation of our consulting practice."
5,"Great selection, excellent performances","This CD only contains a small selection of the terrific music in the original Star Wars trilogy, but it has many wonderful pieces of music, superbly recorded. There is a limit to what can be put on one CD, but the recording could have contained at least another 20 minutes of music. But it is still a fantastic CD.Highlights include:The stirring Fox Fanfare openingThe main Star Wars theme [which is Luke's theme]Princess Leia's themeThe Imperial MarchJabba the Hut's theme, which is a weird sliding tuba solo.If you only want one CD of Star Wars music, this one is well worth having."
5,Telemann in Hamberg,"The Suite for Huntings Horns & Orchestra is an amazing piece of music from that era, it sends tingles up your spine.The balance is also a great listen."
4,Foxy Brown Super Grit,There's some real baddies who deserve everything they get in this blaxploitation classic and who better to dish it out than super foxy Pam Grier and friends. Not as fast paced and a bit uglier than say 'Coffy' but still well worth a look.
2,Foxy Brown,"Wow, What a bad movie. The acting is horrible, and the fight scenes are totally fake. You can see the swinging arms clearly missing the targets but the victim winces in pain none the less. They must be wincing at what they know the audiences will see. The plot has unique twists, with a lot of cutting edge interracial scenes, but that doesn't do much to raise the movie to any serious level of quality acting or production.This is a bomb and I wouldn't recommend this one to a jail full of men who haven't seen a woman in years."
5,The best book ever!,I love this book and my daughter does too! The spanish translates beautifully. The text and story is quite entertaining. I highly recommed this book for babies over 12months.
2,What happened???,"This is one of the most dreadful books I've ever read. When it finally rained I felt like going outside and doing a rain dance. I dislike very few of C.Coulter's books, and this one is right up there with the bad. I've been trying to finish this book for about a month, that's how bad it is. Of course this is only my opinion. I'm being very generous giving it 2 stars."
1,Couldn't finish,I don't remember the last time I could not finish a book until this one. I made it about half way and just could not go on. Hoepfully her next book will be better.
2,Not Coulter's Best - Pass on this one!,"I was very disappointed in the much anticipated book. I had hoped for an exciting story about a curse and people in love. What I got was a time travel story with Witches, Warlocks etc... And a character who kept pulling one of the main characters back in time.I found this story confusing and disappointing. Not up the Coulter's usual excellent writing. There seemed to be parts of the story that were missing and that she had to force some aspects of the story to get things to match up. There were sections where things mysteriously appeared with no real explanation etc... At the same time I kept listening in hopes of being more interested.I recommend that you either look to the Legacy Series or read the Song series.Don't buy this one new. I'd wait until you could get it used."
1,"Stop, If you need this book for a class","This is the longest shipping time I have ever seen for a textbook. It says 2 to 3 weeks in the fine print. When I read it, I guess my eyes and brain corrected the ridiculous time frame and I thought it said 2 to 3 days. Now I won't have my book in time for class. My advice is read the fine print on this before you purchase. Barnes and Nobel is selling it for only a couple of dollars more, but you get it in a week, not two months."
4,This is one weird book,"Many in our book club liked this book, tho I found it very odd. A little too much fantasy for me. So there's that."
5,Wonderful prose; complex and tragic and funny all at once,"This is truly a remarkable book; buried beneath the rubbleof Soviet censorship for twenty years, then partiallyuncovered, The Master and Margarita is now restored to itsfull passion, power and sly, striking sarcasm.With a cast of characters that includes an enormous walking,talking black cat named Behemoth, several slightly prissySoviet writers (most of whom meet satisfying ends) and theDevil Himself, the book is all at once a comment on awriter's life under Stalin, a reworking of the stories ofPontius Pilate and Faust and at the same time, quite funny.I've only read a few books like this (The Sound and theFury was one), where the prose seems to burn beneath yourfingertips, propelling you to the end of the book. It hasall the bluntness and beauty and sly wit of the bestRussian literature. At one point in the novel, a charactersays, ""manuscripts don't burn"" -- what a relief that thisone didn't."
3,Criminally stupid,"LAST CALL is a Canadian-made crime indie written by and starring Phil Morrison as half of a dumbo do-wrong duo.There obviously isn't one good brain between Frank and partner Jonas (Junior Williams). When these two rocket scientists fall deeply into debt to a Mafia loan shark, they rob an after-hours joint, never realizing that the place is run by the mobster's daughter.""Last Call"" is available onDVD.Related item:In the hour-long documentary, SERIAL KILLERS: REAL LIFE HANNIBAL LECTERS (2001), Phil Morrison portrays Lechter himself. (VHS) (DVD)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.(6.2) Last Call (Canada-1999) - Phil Morrison/Junior Williams/Paul Amato/Donna Christo/Arthur L. Bishop/R.J. Dixon/Natalino Grillo/Dena Johnson/Ray Landry/Stuart McKendrick/Max Murray"
5,Your favorite band!,"I had the privilege of hearing the Red Elvises play in Reno, NV during the Rollin' on the River concert series this summer (2012) and one of their sayings ""your favorite band"" is very true for me now. They are awesome entertainers and I absolutely love their music. This is a great CD. Totally worth the price."
3,Give me more,"This album should be called ""Less Than Ourselves"" This album is all filler and no killer. This is just a capitalization on popularity. Their last album ""Heading for Tomorrow"" made an impression on the world and so they wanted to make a HFT 2 and did a real bad job at it. I don't particuarlly like this album, but I gave it a three stars just for the effort of coming out with something they thought we'd like. I own it for the collection and I won't be listening to it less than I have the first time."
1,SKIP IT,"If you have a friend who doesn't know Gamma Ray and you lend this album to him, he'll hear anything from this band again! THis CD was a complete mistake, horrible songs all over the place... I bet Kai Hansen knows that! Scrap this CD from Gamma Ray biography, and you'll have on of the greatest metal bands ever !"
5,"Ar, Matey - Buy This Hat!","A great product for the price. Soft and comfortable even for my extra large head. We used this one and the black one for a week long Scout trip on a tall ship. A no worry design, can pile stuff on it and the wire brim allows you to reshape as needed."
1,not good,IF YOU ARE INTO BRITISH COMEDIES YOU MAY LIKE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU ARE A JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME FAN LIKE ME YOU WON'T. HE IS IN IT FOR LIKE 2 MIN. AND SAYS ABOUT 5 WORDS. HE DOES TAKE OFF HIS SHIRT WHICH IS A PLUS. BUT I HAD TO HAVE IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY MOVIE OF HIS I DID NOT OWN.
1,Not a Van Damme movie!,For one the movie came out in 1984 and for two its not even a Van Damme movie. He plays a small five minute roll in a gay guy and the whole movie is in French. All though he does throw a few kicks into thin air after grabbing some guys wang. The movie sucks. The thew his picture on the cover and re-released it in 1993 hoping to make a few bucks.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this movie.,"I bought this video as a joke. However, the joke was on me when I was forced to watch it with the recipient. Unfortunately, this movie was NOT what I expected it to be. In another aspect, IT WAS WORSE. Not only does the movie steal from other movies, but its choppy, inconsistent in its scenes, and all together BAD. If I was in a movie theater I would have demanded a refund, and some TUMS, for the sour feeling in my stomach."
2,So much potential,"This film had so much potential.Think of the plot: a madman is threatening to blow up a nuclear bomb in Washington D.C. unless a group of brillant men and women can solve his riddles.They have until sun-up.Sounds like a nice thriller right?All night the bag guy asks questions and if the group answers correctly, they win points. They have to earn so many points to stop the bomb.The first mistake was casting Stephen Baldwin as one of the geniuses.The second mistake was writing a script that has almost nothing to do with the plot.Even Tom Sizemore as the villain couldn't save this low-budget fiasco.So much promise with nowhere to go."
3,The Way,"For the price I paid for this book, it was in a good condition. I would definitely order this again if I need too..."
2,I'm still not sure who did what and why.,I had a hard time maintaining interest in this book. I've read all of Ms. Perry's books and have never had this problem. It was difficult to keep the characters and their beliefs straight. However this book has sparked an interest for me in the Irish Problem.
1,Written at a third grade level,"This book provides almost no information beyond common sense. Topics include ""the file cabinet"" and ""the metal shelf"". There are many many other books on sales to choose from. Don't buy this one."
2,didn't last 500 tests,"I bought this recently, and always had problems keeping the batteries in. I had to hold the cap on the whole time for it not to turn off. The sensor also lasted much less than 500 tests. I have had the monitor about 6 months and used it less than 100 times, and now it wonk work until I replace the sensor. It was a lot of money for poor quality, but it did seem to measure alcohol level consistently"
1,Does not work at all.,I have used this product after having three drinks. I waited twenty minutes and received a 000.00 rating on two occasions. I plan on sending it back.
3,Okay,"Says it's accurate up to .01, but I'd say it's accurate up to about .02 at best. You must wait at least 20 minutes before your last drink or you will get wildly inaccurate results, which the manual states in its defense. I bought this as a party favor, but it's not real user friendly for that purpose. Great tool is your want to test if someone is fit to drive if they haven't had a drink for 20-30 minutes, but not real fun just to see how drunk your friend/guest is just for s**t's and giggles, which is why I bought the thing. Bottom line is that the device works, but is not as accurate as it states and it takes some abstinence to be ""accurate."""
2,"well written, but...","this story is basicly about how Ishi's tribeis killed, then a lady comes and finds an indian mumbling about, (Ishi), and she takes him back and teaches him English. The book has Ishi portreyed as a magestic indian, last of his tribe. Really, before the lady ound him, he was an rather stupid indian in moldy clothes lving off roots. Not the greatest indian story around. If you want a great indian story, try ""Troubles Daughter""."
5,A Likeable Jesus,"While this production sticks entirely to the narrative of Matthew's gospel, Bruce Marchiano presents Jesus as a Man among men, filled with the joy of living, who who LIKES people and is himself likeable, has a sense of humor,while maintaining a sense of his dignity and mission. This would be an excellent medium for introducing Christ to anyone who thinks of Him as remote and far-removed. Two thumbs up!"
5,Change Your View of Christ Forever!,"This movie is amazing!The 2 CDs in the set are an audio book by Bruce Marchiano telling the story of how he got the part in the movie and his journey to portray Christ as a man of great joy. The story of the miracles that happened during the production are astonishing! I would suggest that you listen to it before you watch the movie.The 4 hour movie will change the way you think about Christ forever. Jesus had 3 short years to share Himself with His ""children"" here on Earth. They were 3 years filled with love, miracles, and JOY! Bruce does an amazing job of showing Jesus as a ""Man of Great Joy.""I started out loaning my copy to friends, but the waiting list got so long I purchased 10 copies to give away to my family and friends. Now they all are sharing the movie with friends. I especially love the reaction from my non-Christians friends.... this movie will change your life."
3,simple plot,"not much of a story, plot is very basic. Pam Grier makes it three stars for her pretty face and hot body, which you get a few peeks at in the movie. I would just wait for it to come on tv and watch it, unless you can find it for a few bucks,"
2,GREAT MOVIE BUT.........,"My hopes for a digitally remastered version of Pam Grier's 'Coffy' were killed when I obtained this AWFUL mono DVD!! Yuck!! Don't get me wrong, I love the movie (& Pam!!), but this DVD should be destroyed ASAP!! The mono sound is no better than an average VHS tape, but the picture quality is fairly decent.I thought that I would see 'Coffy' with surround sound, but NOOOOOO!! The sound is terrible, so save your money & get the video tape (or wait for a PROPER DVD VERSION!!!)."
3,Disappointment but not disgust,"Overwritten. If a comma comes after an introductory phrase, please place it there. A run on sentence is usually extremely difficult to follow and understand when it's past two paragraphs long. Some of the language was indeed beautiful -- others portions of the book dragged...the best way to put it is ""it was like watching 1/4 of Days of Our Lives...and not really getting it."" AP students have to suffer so dearly for their intelligence...."
1,Return of the Native Review,"In this not so thrilling, spinetingling book, the three main characters are caught up in a love triangle. While the intro of the book is tragicly boring, taking a chapter and a half just to describe the heath. It's dialogue will leave you slumbering. The ending of the book will also make you think what the heck was this author on when he wrote this."
2,"Disappointing, Boring, Bare Film","I loved Hanake's ""The Pianist"", also with Isabelle Huppert, but this film was just plain boring. All of the deep anguish and philosophical statements Haneke may have been trying to convey were too vague, buried too deep in the long shots across foggy fields and depressed faces of traumatized people. The lack of dialogue didn't help the viewer understand what is going on. A much better movie on the topic of how humans deal with the shock and suffering of a near-apocalyptic event, set in the same beautiful natural context, is Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Stalker""."
1,They call this Off-Broadway?!,"I have never been so disappopinted and appalled by a recording in my life. I have played numerous shows on and off-Broadway, and I have no words to explain the sounds this recording captured. First of all the music is trite. The composer doesn't have an original idea in him. The singers were ok, except for a few that weren't even in time with the orchestra. The conductor is also billed as a mixer, and I must say that I hope he hasn't quit his day job. Everything about this recording is sloppy. How can someone market such a disaster?Do yourself and my collegues a favor: use your money to promote good theatre."
4,Photo Dictionary,It is a good product. Longman photo dictionary has a variety of vocabulary and pictures that makes easy to boost my Englisth.
4,Looking to learn Adobe Illustrator 8.0 ????,Adobe Illustrator 8.0 is a industry-standard illustration software package and if you are looking to do any type of design work you will need to know how to use it. I have found that this book will get you up to speed with Adobe Illustrator 8.0 without alot of work and time. Adobe Illustrator 8.0 Classroom in a Book book will show you everything you need to know to get going.
2,no viewing choice,How can anyone make a choice when you cannot see what the other designs look like before purchase. I would be upset if I were the seller and my customers could not view anything other than the pine cone design.I moved on to other purchases and I will bet others did the same...
1,Fools you into believing this is a smoke alarm,"This item was purchased and installed on Sep 2008, and stopped working slightly more than 4 years later, even though the product stated it is supposed to work for 10 years. It was over-reactive to cold temperature in the room (below 60 F) or hot humid air coming indoors during summer days. When food was burning on the stove, and smoke filled the entire house, it stayed remarkably calm and assured that such ""nuisance"" is not worth reacting too. What a waste of money!"
1,10 yr battery not really,Manufactured apr 2010 battery died apr 2011. Why was this highly rated by consumer reports?First Alert SA10YR 10 Year Lithium Power Smoke Detector
5,"""Don't be dumb"", said the crumb. ""Reissue!""","I loved this book as a child. I found a copy at my local library's sale, and came online to buy extra copies for my classroom. I cannot believe this book is out of print! I use it not only for rhyming lessons, but also for teaching contractions. My second-graders love it!"
3,Long,"This is a long book compared to other cozy mysteries. The many theories that were considered, rejected, reconsidered, rejected again, etc., made for some tedious reading at times as it seemed no progress at all was being made. I skipped through much of the ""rehashing"" of the theories and also through the long description of the attempts to decipher the letter as I was unable to follow the reasoning, maybe because I'm not that good at puzzles. Once the solution was arrived at, the murder was proved to be well thought out and executed, but getting there seemed to take forever. I see that the next book in the series is even longer, so I hope I can follow it along a bit more easily."
2,Tedium in time,"A puzzling murder where the time of death is crucial. Unfortunately most of the novel is wasted effort. If you don't mind being led down a garden path and then having a cream pie thrown in your face, you'll love this. I hated it."
1,pieces don't match,I purchansed several sets of this flatware. I have found some large spoons weigh 55 grams and some weight 48 grams and have a very differnent shape and feel. I have also found some small forks and small spoons also have a different shape and feel. Many of the pieces had very visible grinding marks. The difference seems to be country of origin. The pieces made in USA all match and the pieces made in China all match. In some cases the USA made were better finish and shape and in one case the China made were heavier and had a smoother finish. It is a real dissappointment that my set doesn't match.
2,Very lightweight,"Aquarius is too lightweight gauge metal, and looks ""cheap"" and not inexpensive. Disappointing purchase. Photo looks to be a combination of shiny and matte finish, but it is only shiny."
2,"KEYBOARD: = 3 Stars , COMPANY = 2 Stars","KEYBOARD: (3 Stars)This is the third KeyUSee keyboard I have purchased over the last few years. I love the size and the contrast of the letters. And, the ""Sleep"" key is located in a logical spot, (i.e. not next to the down arrow, as it is on another brand of large print keyboards).However, I have found that after several months of moderate use, the ""A"", ""Q"" and ""Tab"" keys stop working. While this may be due to a virus, it doesn't seem to affect my other keyboards.COMPANY: (2 Stars)Despite paying for ""Express"" delivery, the box took nearly two weeks to arrive. Also, the confirmation email did not contain a tracking number. When I left a voice message for the company, requesting a tracking number, I received no response."
3,Interesting to say the least,"In the begining I got this book only to read ""Beauty and the Opera"" by Suzy Charnas. Now, this was an um, interesting look at what might have happened if Erik had made Christine go through with the marrige she had promised him. Now, to do this Christine did not seem to stay in character, which I suppose was fine. She was not the meek little mouse that she usually is. And to live with Erik I suppose one would have to grow up. There is a lot of mention of Erik's face and what Christine really thought it. Also in this version Erik and Christine are well.. I suppose one can say, closer then they ever were. A good read for the very avid ""phreak"". Just another perspective of Erik and Christine."
3,Looks great but not practical,"Your Ipod looks great sitting on this heavy duty plastic tabletop holder. However, the plug just kind of hangs there when you unplug it. So if your not careful the plug falls back in the holder the feedthru opening and it's a pain to feed it back through again. So if you don't mind the small inconvience it does what it is supposed to."
5,Love it!!,This movie is sooo good. It is touching amd trust me you will cry! My best friend and I watched it back when it first came out and we couldn't stop crying. It's just a sweet movie.
3,no title,"Only gave it three stars, even though Christian Slater was wonderful - every woman's dream of romantic. But I had problems with why Caroline didn't insist he get a heart transplant. She heard the doctor; is she that stupid?"
2,Not bad,"The reason that I think this movie is not bad yet I only gave it 2 stars is cause I rated another movie that I liked better with 3 stars. Anyway. It was good but my complaints are #1: Christian Slater's haircut in the beggining. Whats with those little pieces in the back?!(I know that is not important but who cares) #2: The pace was very, very, very SLOW!!!!!! and #3: I don't think that Marisa Tomei did a very good job. Otherwiese it was interesting and sad. I think the only thing that saved me from not liking this movie is the fact that I am a die hard romantic. And I mean DIE-HARD romantic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Product Information,"What it doesn't say above in the product information is that this is the re-issue of an EMI/Virgin Classics CD originally released in 1991. It is therefore the work of a very young Leif Ove Andsnes. It is interesting to listen to this CD and hear the growth of the artist in his many later works. As far as I am aware, this is the first CD that the artist did under the EMI label. Andsnes' only work preceding this CD is a recording of Prokofiev's Piano Concerto performed with the Bergen Philharmonic and released one year earlier on the Simax label.Although Amazon is usually very good about giving the original release dates for material recycled by the recording companies, this is one of several instances where the product information is incomplete in the Andsnes catalog of releases."
1,riddled with mistakes,"I am a 1st year ph.d. student at a to 10 grad prog in econ. I thought I would use this book to brush up on really basic micro(I didn't major in micro in undergrad). On top of being confusing and badly written, I found 3 blatant errors in the first 3 pages. The other authors are right. This has to be worst textbook that I have ever seen."
1,Awful Book,"This book deserves a zero rating. As mentioned by others the book only provides even answers with no explanation, how extremely frustrating when you are stuck on a question. Waste of money. I was so disappointed I binned the book. Can anyone recommend a proper workout book in intermediate microeconomics?"
4,Movie review,"I got my iteam on time and watched it the night it came.The movie was different, but I enjoyed it. Although it was a rather short movie (like 90 mintues I think or something close)so that kind of sucked.Other than that it was job, the acting was good and I thought the plot was original.Some people may need to watch it a few times I complettly understand it, but if you watch the entire thing and pay attention you should get it.It has a surprising ending I did NOT see coming which made it even better (it's hard for movies to surprise you now but this one does)Overall Great, but kind of short.If you like thrillers and movies that make you think/ will throw you a curve ball you'll like this!"
2,Dark Harbor,"I love Alan Rickman so I bought this because of him. Other than Alan being in it, the film is a waste of time. I didn't like the drifter, the wife was only semi-nice, Alan was moping and the stop frame mushroom thing was stupid. All the important information in the film was delivered in blocks of dialogue instead of being slipped in throughout the movie. Between important dialogue the movie was dull and boring. Buy this if you love Alan Rickman and need it for your collection but don't buy it to see a good mystery."
5,Everyone's a Critic! 'Lucas' was Phenomenal!,"Reading many of these reviews after having seen the movie myself, I've come to the conclusion MANY seem to agree with: This was an amazing film, and those who criticize it are upset that they didn't think of the idea first! It was a 9-minute independent film, and yet wove through Star Wars, George Lucas, and Shakespeare in Love so slyly, that you must applaud Mr. Nussbaum, Mr. Dowling, and Mr. Levy for an amazing piece of cinema.To those who criticize, go ahead and nag! The people, however, have spoken, making it the most downloaded movie ever on the Internet, and I understand that Mr. Nussbaum is the talk of Hollywood as the next big director out of USC. Don't take my word for it - Read the Wall Street Journal, People Magazine, and the New York Times! If the biggest complaint is that 'Lucas' isn't long enough, it's a testament to the genius and skill of those involved. Bravo!"
4,"It's no ""Steven Spielberg's Movie""","I found it unique that a movie finally used every word and action of the script for a purpose. Even though this is an easy task for such a short, it is captivating beyond the first viewing. The story of the directors, Nussbaum and Levy, reminds me of Daltas and Westfall, who made ""Steven Spielberg's Movie"" after hailing from the same office in USC as the ""Lucas"" minds. I have to admire Nussbaum and Levy's short for its spin on the Star Wars Classics. What a great idea. Not only is Star Wars a legend we all know, but there are many a fan who go nuts over anything Star Wars. When you mix that with a quality short film, you just watch the money flow. If you liked this, you should check out Steven Spielberg's Movie."
4,loved it!,"Just received my DVD of ""Lucas"" and the other films and thought that Lucas looked much better on the DVD than on the internet. I especially liked ""Swingblade"" but how come no comments from those guys? Also, Film Club was good but I didn't get all the references. All in all a great group of films!"
1,Blissfully short - but still too long,A 30 second joke told over and over. You can almost feel thesmarm lapping around your ankles.
3,Not Quite the Sum of Its Parts,"There's much to admire in Anna McGrail's ""Mrs. Einstein."" The author has a good grasp of the major discoveries of 20th Century physics and their historical importance. She has created well-defined characters, and spun out their odyssey briskly. And she can evoke the feel of bygone times and places. It would seem that the ingredients for a superior novel are at hand.But it doesn't quite jell--except possibly as a female parable. As mainstream fiction, ""Mrs. Einstein"" shows its superstructure and premises too nakedly, and fails to develop a life of its own. For some reviewers, this flaw seems to work as a kind of magic realism, and to enhance the book's power. But the story and style are as romantic as they are realistic, and the ""magic"" can get grating at times, particularly at the end, with its sudsy sentimentalism worthy of a new YaYa Sisterhood. All in all, though, ""Mrs. Einstein"" is a clever yarn that covers interesting ground. I'm glad I read it."
3,Somewhat satisfied,"I bought this as a replacement bulb for my microwave and assumed it would work with my microwave's hi/low/off settings. Unfortunately, the bulb only allows on or off. When it's turned on it is only as bright as my old bulb's low setting which is pretty dim."
2,"Over-rated &#65533; OK book, but not deserving of the praise.","I found this book to be quite over-rated. The writing was simplistic and lacking in depth. Many people consider Hemingway's writing style simplistic, but there was depth of meaning beneath his unadorned manner of writing. Oprah has performed a valuable service for the public by encouraging reading through her book club. However, this book is like a good TV show. It may be 'good', but in the end it's still only TV. Also, I have a problem with the accuracy of the author's depiction of turn of the century Appalachia. He displays some knowledge of the area (poke is a local term for sack or bag), but I felt overall many details were suspect and lacking in complete credibility. For readers seeking a touching and more accurate picture of the time and locale, I suggest THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE by Forrest Carter. His account is true and the writing is exceptional, in a sublime way. It was a 1991 Abby Award recipient."
1,Total Flop,"It was a genuine disappointment, from the subtitle ""the story of a marriage"" you expect to read about all that comes with the package of sacrifice, hardship and victory, but it has nothing much to offer than any youngster already knows. You keep hoping for the clinch to come, but it never does."
5,A WONDERFUL SHORT NOVEL,"Actually, there is not all that much not to like about this novel. The writing is extremely well done, excellent character developement, flowing prose and a story well told and of hope. The author certainly did his research on this one and pretty well nailed the background of the time and place. I am not a great fan of The O's book club selections, but certainly had to agree with her on this one. Unlike the ""Spotlight Reviewer"" here, I do see why all the fuss was made over this work. It is good, simple as that. Perhaps I am not jaded enough or lack a certain level of sophistication, who knows. Now don't get me wrong, not everyone enjoys the same thing, the same genre, etc. but most folks can and do appreciate good writing and a good story by a good story teller. With this book we have that. Recommend it highly."
3,Too heavy on melodrama,"Gap Creek is a great story, but it's too heavy on tragedy, hardship, and melodrama. It ends on a slight uplift toward hope, but nothing in the previous too-many pages leads readers to believe things will EVER work out for Julie and Hank. There's some beautiful writing in these pages, but man, this author needs to lighten up a little on the pathos. What is it with these Oprah books that seem to celebrate misery?"
5,This book is a real eye-opener!,"Although this book had so many unfortunate incidents for these two young people, it makes you sit back and appreciate life. It teaches you not to take anything for granted. I would definately recommend it to anyone!"
2,Boring,"This book was a disappointment. I couldn't find a plot thick enough to hold on to. I kept thinking one would turn up with each new charecter that was introduced,but no. The characters outside Hank and Julie just seeemed to come,cause a little misery and go. I gave it 2 stars because, I did continue reading it, wanting to know what was going to happen next. Sadly,nothing conclusive ever did."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have come to look forward to Oprah's book choices every month - she has introduced me to so many talented new novelists. However, Gap Creek is not one of her better choices. While the main character, Julie, and particularly her deep faith and the comfort she finds in hard work, seems very real, none of the other characters are at all developed. Particularly empty is Julie's husband Hank, and the relationship between the two of them - I was looking forward to seeing this fleshed out, after all, the book is subtitled ""Story of a Marriage"" - but the interactions between husband and wife were very stiff and unengaging. At times the details about food, cleaning, etc.-- while enormously interesting -- threaten to overwhelm the plot structure. I think that Morgan did an enormous amount of fascinating research, but that he did not quite manage to write the book he had hoped to."
3,Disappointing overall,"Honestly, this book was boring. It reads like an instruction manual for how to live in the mountains at the turn of the last century. Particularly annoying was the overuse of he said, she said, especially when only two people were talking and it was obvious who said what. Hank was a verbally abusive bully. Julie didn't know him well enough before marrying him to see this side of him. I couldn't bear him and finally just skipped through pages to see how the book ended."
3,Ok if you are not looking for something too complex...,"I enjoy complex stories and this one is definately not. The idea of the story is quite good. A young woman in a time period set approximately one hundred years ago getting married and on her own for the first time. Encountering a lot of HARD times along the way seemed like a really good base for a novel, but did not pull through as a quick page turner for me. The dialog was really simple, which was a good effect for the setting, but the characters seemed very shallow and plain. Not too much development there. No schemes or abundances of intelligence. And the thing I enjoyed the least about it was the unhealthy relationship of the newlyweds. I have read much better, much more complex and interesting books."
3,A tragic story that has high highs and low lows.,"I found this story to be completely uplifting and exhilerating at times but I also found that it had needless discriptions and too much tradegy. The cover jacket claims that this novel is the ""story of a marriage"". However the main characters, Julie and Hank have only been married a few months throughout the majority of the book. Also, Hank hardly talked enough for the reader to see what kind of relationship him and Julie really had. This book has its defining moments but overall it lacked in defining its characters and the relationships they had with one another."
2,Very negative,"The writer, Robert Morgan, was able to describe things in such a way that I knew exactly how things were done. For example, I now know precisely how a hog is butchered. But the book as a whole was very negative. This young couple met with one disaster after another. Julie was a hard working, seemingly intelligent woman. But she kept making mistakes which caused some disasterous outcomes. And her husband and mother in law were such losers, it was hard to take. I mean, didn't they have any redeeming qualities that lasted? I felt very sad after reading this book. I would not recommend it, except for the exceptionally descriptive writing."
5,Marriage is not always about Romance!,"I loved this book. It is a gritty, realistic, gross, funny, touching, and loving look at the relationship between a young couple set against a harsh timeperiod. This should be a pre-marital must read for all young women who think that marriage should be all wine and roses! Might even cut down on the divorce rate!! :-) If Julie can stay with her husband and keep her head on with all she had to endure surely we can put up with dirty socks, hair in the sink, and too much time at the office!! Julie is a survivor through and through and I think that we can all find some of her in ourselves -- the courage to do what has to be done and to be happy with what we are given and where we are planted."
2,Big disappointment,"I have been a Robert Morgan fan since reading his collection of short stories, but I put this book down before I was halfway through. Although spouse abuse might have been acceptable in those days, Morgan didn't make it acceptable in my mind. I just plain didn't like or care about Hank. Eventually I found Julie tiresome because she just seemed to take his slaps and name calling in stride, going to on to scrub out one Aegean stable after another."
2,Oh Please....,"I bought the audio tape of this 'book' and I guess I'm glad I did, because if the book was anything like the tape - it was boring as hell! I would never have been able to finish reading the book unless I made a reservation at a sleep clinic! With all the books in all the world, if this is the best Oprah could do - ? I just tore up my membership card."
3,Masterful use of language but The Dollmaker is a better book,"I love Morgan's words but Julie's life was just too difficult and finally seemed not quite believable to me. I kept expecting some little ray of light to come into this story but it seemed every time life began to get a little better, another tragedy struck. In The Dollmaker there is similar hardship but somehow Arnow's characters are more fully developed and you feel that their strength will enable them to push on through it. I love Morgan's use of language but this was not a very satisfying book."
4,was a good read,I enjoyed reading it. I was written very well and the author kept me engaged. The characters had very real to life emotions and once I got into the book I had trouble putting it down.
2,Annoying audio,"I listen to a lot of audio books and this was the most annoying one I've ever listened to. Perhaps reading the book is much better, but since this is a review on the audio, I don't recommend it. The reader was exhausting and she said every single ""said"" the book had written. Example: ""I don't know"" Pappa said... ""But I think so"", I said. ""You must go"", Mamma said. ""Why"", I said... ""because it's the best thing to do"", Pappa said. In one paragraph she probably said about 8 ""said's"". I began to notice myself just concentrating on the ""saids"" and not the actual story of the book. Her inflictions, etc... UGG. After two CD's I couldn't bare to listen anymore. Sadly, the story was pretty decent, which is why I say to just bye the book and not the audio CD's."
1,Boo to Gap Creek,"I have read many books on the appalachain woman, this is poor. Julie should have knocked her husband up the side of his head with a spoon! He lied to her . He did nothing to help her and ran home to fetch his mother; who was the cause of all the trouble. No mother -in-law should force her pregnant daughter-in-law to butcher and lift large kettles of lard! This book is not worth the money paid to read it. The character development does NOT portray a true pioneer. It needs a rewrite to become a true depiction of mountain people. I suggest you read Follow the River / by Thom to know the hardships of the wilderness or the books by Allen Eckart instead. For a fun set of mountain people read anything by Jesse Stuart-now that's true mountain magic"
4,A Book Worth Your While,I enjoyed the way the author wrote and I enjoyed the story being told. It was fun to imagine myself in Julie's position. An inspiring book that took me far away from my everyday life and made me appreciate the conviences that I enjoy. Julie was a strong and likable character. Definitely worth the read.
1,Gap Creek,"This was my first and last ""Oprah"" book. It was well written - but way way too depressing - not one good thing happened to the main character (nor the others). I was given the audiobook and listened to it on my commute to work - I continued hoping that something pleasant would transpire - the book put me in a sad mood all week - thank goodness it was abridged."
3,Disappointed,"I am sorry for all the authors who have written really GOOD books but have not been chosen by Oprah as a recommended read. I found Gap Creek to be a thin story and inconsistently written. I found references to the Millenium, lipstick and foil to be out of place in a story taking place in 1899. Facts the editor should have noticed. Also, the grammatically incorrect speech patterns use in their everyday life were never used in the many prayers in this story. Mr. Morgan would wax-on with very detailed descriptions of the colors Julie was seeing during semi-dream/sexual sequences but never described Julie physically to his readers. A description I found myself wanting throughout the entire book. I was 3/4 through the book before I had that feeling of wanting to know what was going to happen next, but nothing really did. A lost opportunity to write something really special. Written on the reading level of a sixth grader."
2,simple book,"This book is so basic, so simple and almost too predictable. Not challenging in the least bit. Oprah could pick have chosen a better book to recieve so much hype! Nice story, but lacking..."
5,Innocence,"A wonderful book, culdn't put it down. Read it in one reading.The innocence of the young, not knowing what to do but then yet able to do it and learn from it.Hard lessons from nature and yet still able to cope. I would like to see some of the young people of today learn some hard lessons and be able to cope. Thank you for this wonderful book."
3,not as good as I thought,"This novel was not as good as I thought it would be. It's stuck between literature and commercial fiction. It's entertaining, but did not move me in any real way. For rural settings and hardscrabble lives, I prefer Cormac McCarthy, Larry Brown, or Eric Rickstad's REAP. No more Oprah for me, thanks!"
1,Hasbro throwing out the re-hash,"Hasbro is just tossing out old re-hashed star wars figures trying to cash in on a quick buck. nothing new or original here, just old figures tossed in with a new swoop bike... can we get something new for a change, or is this what the esecs at hasbro think we want?"
5,"More Monty than ""Full Monty""","Very humorous documentary of six working-class British men who are inspired by the movie ""The Full Monty"". It follows the lads in the weeks up to their big debut as they work out their routine and obtain national stardom. It includes interviews with the lads and their wives and girlfriends. Finally, toward the end of the film, they strut their stuff in front of hundreds of rowdy women. These blokes leave NOTHING to the imagination. You'll laugh yourself silly during their can-can number."
1,Can't believe how quickly the System Board went,"This computer was purchased in 2007 for my mom's 75th birthday. She almost never used it. Our family used it ""very little"". She died in February of 09 and I inherited it. I used it ""lightly"" from March until early September and it just died. Called customer service and they determined that it needed a new system board. This would cost about $250.00 plus repair costs because it wasn't under warranty. It would be cheaper to purchase a refurbished laptop. Really sad and gives me a very bad impression of Toshiba. I actually purchased a DVD player of theirs and it died in a couple of months. It was under warranty so I sent it back and got a new one. Again died in a couple of months. I'll pretty much stay away from Toshiba from now on."
2,Club Fun Table top Miniature Pool Table,"Overall a poor quality product for the price. After reading both the good and bad reviews, I decided to take a risk so expectations were already lowered.Cons: The workmanship of this item is very poor. It requires a bit of work to level the table. The legs screwed on with a little extra effort and when attempting to remove them, a bolt came off the leg and stayed stuck on the table. The felt was stapled with very visible stapes. The core material of the table was cheap fiber board (not even MDF) so that's why screws do not stay on. All screws holding the pockets were loose.Pros: The only thing I liked about this product are the balls and slightly curved cue sticks.Bottom Line: Look elsewhere for better quality product. After struggling with leveling the table, by removing the legs and sitting the table on a flat plywood board, I managed to have some fun."
1,unhappy with product and price pro,this item is a piece of junk..it came broken another was sent out and it also came in damaged..then when i requested a refund i was denied..price pro is a big ripoff....Club Fun Tabletop Miniature Pool Table Toy / Game
3,"OK for the price, but beware of the vendor","For a little 'toy' pool table it appears fairly well built. The balls and sticks are fairly good quality. However, be careful what vendor you purchase from. I bought from ""The Price Pros"" and the box arrived terribly damaged with excessive packing tape to cover all the rips and tears in the box. The box was also very wet. Additionally, one of the table leg screws was missing and one of the corner pockets was bent."
1,Beautiful for 3 years,"We installed this in our kitchen 3 years ago. Love the look. Just beautiful. For the last 6 months every time you turn on the faucet, water starts pooling around the base of the sprayer attachment.Also have had issues in the past with the sprayer itself. For me this was an expensive item ($400 if memory serves me correctly). If I wanted to service it every 6 months then I would have spent $250 bucks less and purchased a cheaper faucet.I'm disappointed. Don't hate it, but definetly sad."
4,"A ""Very Good"" purchase","Mr. Lopez is very good - as compared to excellent or superior. I enjoy listening to the CD. His style is quite pleasant.The copy of ""If I Had a Hammer"" is a club version; his original single was a bit stronger."
5,Essential Mother Teresa.,"This book contains Mother Teresa's reflections on spiritual subjects like prayer, holiness, forgiveness etc. They are classified under different heads. To the modern sophisticated mind her ideas may look nave and old fashioned, but her faithfulness to Jesus Christ her Lord was the utmost ideal in that life. And that is what raises her to the level of a modern saint. Her simple stories narrated with some sense of humor demonstrate her earnestness and zeal. Her simplicity and depth of faith are evident through these reflections. The book also contains an interview with Mother Teresa and a short biographical sketch. There is also a thought provoking forward by Fr Thomas Moore."
1,bauxite,decided not to keep the partner. Missed fact it is aluminum cast and smaller tan what I expected. Bought a rockchicker for $135 at local vendor. This will last my lifetime and my grandson's.
1,Painfully Bad.,"I think the target was comedy but the director and script missed the mark. Hurt and Tilly must have received no direction and worse script because they come off as zombies. The plot is about Hurt and Tilly's 10 yr. old daughter being chased by killers who know she witnessed them murdering a man. The killers are laughably incompetent....just not over-the-top enough. The movie is billed as a tense thriller. It is only tense in that you will squirm to see such fine actors look ridiculous in this mess. ""Home Alone"" pulled this off. Originally titled ""Do Not Disturb"". Good advice. Don't open this can of worms."
3,Time not kind to Quicksilver,Perfect example of how my memory of the music is vastly superior to the experience of listening to Quicksilver Messenger Service in 2012. The music --- firmly affixed in 1968 --- does not well survive time travel. Led Zeppelin it ain't.
2,A Real Review on NFL Gameday.,"NFL Gameday commercial says this game got good Defense? are you kidding me?the Cpu is so stupid on this game.i played this game on hall a fame level they can't check my reicevers,and my D-Back can't check theres,it's like that on rookie too.I never won a coin toss on this game yet.i might just have bad luck but come on,the play action fakes are stupid,you get sack every time just about and they do it so slow.,another thing when you running the ball you think you are going to out run them? are you kidding me they can hit you 5 yards away.the Graphics are good thats it,please get some new commentarys,like the sunday night Espn Crew,Hey 989 be the first to have 3 commentarys,Do something! I like how every time i run the ball with the QB he fumbles 90% of the time,its just bad gameplay,How could you make a Football game for like 10 years and still be stupid,atlease the ps1 version DeFence is better,and another thing they do the same tackles over and over again.A RENTAL ONLY"
3,"In the tradition of ""Animal House"", ""Porky's, & ""Road Trip..","Come along for the mis-adventures of Scotty & 3 of his friends, who decide to back-pack across Europe to find the woman of his dreams. If you enjoy a wild, care free,(and sometimes raunchy)Summer movie (even though it was released in February)you'll like this one. I'll have to admit, Eurotrip is DEFINATELY a guilty pleasure & may not be for everyone. Be forewarned....It's a movie about partying high school kids. Sex, drinking, loud music, sex......electric testicle clamps. WHAT???!!! Lol!Eurotrip was filmed on location across Europe (great scenery), & has cameo appearances by Kristin Kreuk (Lana from Smallville), Matt Damon, Lucy Lawless (Xena), Fred Armisten (SNL), & one of those chicks from ""Absolutely Fabulous.""...It's destined to become a classic in it's genre' of teen movies."
4,Entertaining movie!,"I am over 30, but I've always liked to watch teen movies, mainly John Hughes' funny stories. This Eurotrip is somewhat over the top, but the characters are caught so naturally in the continuous weird situations that you are obliged to laugh! Four friends go to Europe during summer. Scott's girlfriend abruptly ends their relationship and in his sadness he discovers the internet friend he has in in truth a beautiful German girl. Then, he flies to Europe with his best friend Cooper in search of his true love. There, the twins Jenny and Jamie complete the group! There are countless scenes stereotyping both Americans and Europeans, sexually and culturally speaking. It is not for all audiences as some jokes really go deep and beyond... but if you just want to have something to laugh and not ponder about it, this is the movie for you!"
4,Michelle Tranchtenberg Shines,I normally hate gross-out films so the only reason I went to see Eurotrip is for Michelle Trachtenberg's post-Buffy debut. I kept laughing throughout the film. There is very little gross-out humor. Its mostly sex and fish-out-of-water humor which is especially funny if you've traveled through Europe. I don't see how the film can be insulting to Europe because its a comedy. The only bad part was when they messed with the Vatican but the rest of the film was excellent. I cannot wait to buy the DVD.
5,Euro Trip DVD,"Great Price, Funny Movie, DVD Used But Arrived In Like New Shape, Fast S&H, Product As Described, A+++ Amazon Seller"
4,Tasteless and hilarious.,"Eurotrip is a tasteless and ridiculous comedy. It is about a group of 4 friends that go on a trip across Europe in order to find Scotty Thomas' pen pal girlfriend. The foursome goes through all kinds of crazy stuff and causes lots of trouble all the way from France to Amsterdam. The movie is raunchy, perverted, and stupid; but I really liked it. It made me laugh like a maniac, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you've seen any other National Lampoons films then you know what you're gonna get. Pure silliness, and enjoyment."
3,"Almost there, but it falls short","Fun, fun, fun. An excuse to jokes, and well done at that. But like all this kind of films, in the end is a conservative call for a united family and the one-girlfriend forever style of life of the Fifties. Self conscious, to say the least (""well, there you have your R Rating"") but with a bland hero and the tendency to abandon suicidal (and interesting) leanings and falls in the way of normalcy (Eastern Europe and the sisters, the Papal incident, etc). A little bit serious, longer and bolder, and this would have been an interesting satire."
1,Crap and a Half,"Imagine internet geeks writting a movie script in between their online porn and everquest, and you get a good idea of this movie. The jokes in this movie suck, the acting is poor, and the story makes no sense. Why would a guy fly to Europe to meet a girl off the internet? He would have to be a fat, old loser who cant get any here in the US. And ask yourself, would that internet ""hottie"" really be a lonely girl, or would it be another fat, old, balding loser? The only people who will enjoy this movie are nerds who want to see some nudity, but why watch a boring movie to get a couple of glimpses? A blind drunk monkey on crack could make a better film than this. Don't waste your money on this ""comedy."""
4,Fantastic Comedy!,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It was so unbelievably well made, great writers. I'm not going to get into why I love the movie so much for fear of divulging too much about it to someone who hasn't seen it as of yet, but take my word for it and see this movie. This is definitely worthy of everyone's DVD collection.As a side note, the unrated version of the DVD isn't all it's cracked up to be, and it's basically the same as the original."
3,It's average.,"I saw it and I laughed hard at a moment here and there, but someof the less tasteful and less well-written plot elements (such as the green fairy)left me feeling a bit offended that the writing was not consistent and took my good mood away posthaste.It was a partially-forgivable film,so I suppose it deserves a C.I'm just curious as to how this could have possibly looked any better on script?"
4,Kennedy kicks...!,Kennedy is the housewives choice of classical artist. For this reason I have often stayed well clear. But this a superb recording of my favorite piece of classical music. I used to have it on a budget Naxos CD - that has now been consigned to the bin - this is a great CD. - Track 3 is inspirational!
5,It does what it should.,It worked perfect in my 07 fit and came pre stripped as well. There isn't much to say about a wire harness but it does the job well.
5,Simple and works great,Inexpensive. Fits perfectly with the stock wiring harness. Quality product. Happy with the Metra harness but not the Metra dash kit.
1,feo,creo que es una porqueria ... de onda no? i think is awful.. eu o acho horrivelfacundo aguante Eduardo Galeano
2,Of interest to the curious,"Not much of anything happens in this story. Not much at all. No stand-out characters, either. This will be of interest only to those who are curious about the work of Charles Portis. Nobody else, really."
3,Entertaining time passer,"Chain of Command is an acceptable,delivering made-for-video action film.Once again,Roy Scheider plays the US president (in slimy mode here)and the plot is strangely more intricate and surprising than you might expect from such a film.Overall,this delivers the goods and is very watchable because of it."
5,Great Workout!!,"I love Tracie Long as an instructor. This is a great, fun workout, with great cueing and music. The background is in the grand mansion--as usual with the original firm workouts---nice. I was very pleased."
3,The Firm Maximum body shaping,"I've been working out with videos for a few years now. This video is a good workout but I didn't feal that I dot enough cardio workout with this video. It does work the upper body quite well. I have other firm videos, like the Firm Total Body which I always come away from fealing like I've had a good workout. This is definately for the beginner to immediate level."
3,WWF Attitude Hits Manchester!,"This event may have been a lot better if WWF Home Video actually showed more than one hour. Considering the fact that there were eight matches on one card, there could have been a lot more to this video. The event took place just days after Wrestlemania 14. The new WWF Champion-Stone Cold Steve Austin makes his first televised title defense against Challenger and WWF European Champion-HHH. The Undertaker takes on Kane in a rematch from WM14. The WWF Tag Team Champions-New Age Outlaws vs. Challengers-L.O.D. 2000. Cactus Jack vs. The Artist Formerly Knows As Goldust. Ken Shamrock and Owen Hart vs. WWF Intercontinental Champion-The Rock and D-Lo Brown of the Nation of Domination. Bradshaw takes on Marvelous Marc Mero. In a Country Whippin' Match, the D.O.A. take on the Godwinns. Plus, Jeff Jarrett goes one on one with Brakus."
2,Let down!,I was in the store today looking for a video to buy for 12 dollars. Because it was all I had so I pick this video up. A very disappointing tape for one Michael Cole and Kevin Kelly get the hell out of here. The only good match was Austin vs HHH and that was the only reason. Why I bought it don't waste your money. Letdown matches edited for example the Rock was about to talk and they edit it. One reason to buy it HHH vs Austin nothing more. If you know someone who has this tape just record that match.
5,"Awesome book, awesome price",I checked this book out at the library and had to have it so I looked for it on Amazon. I got it for 0.24 + 3.99 shipping. It is an expensive big hardback book! My son is only 6 and he is so interested in it. We learn 1 or 2 new presidents a week on days when he feels like doing a little extra learning after he gets home from school. It got him so interested that we had to visit DC to see the monuments and the presidents homes (there are quite a few in VA).
5,I salute this book for being great!,"My 8 year old son and I love this book. He reads it weekly and always brings me some new fact or story to talk about.Well written and concise overview of all the great (and not-so-great men) who have governed our wonderful nation over the past 230 years.Learn about presidents in easy to digest, short sections. Great for the youngster in your life who likes history.Super book.We own a few different books by ""National Geographic Children's Books"" and we love them all."
5,Very good book!,I am enjoying this book. It will give you a good glimpse of our presidents' lifes and dedication to our country. Highly recommended.
2,Ok but not the best,"I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products. My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter. The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment. She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest. Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside. It just doesn't rock much. I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it. The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set."
3,"Small item, not much fun","Turned out to be much smaller than we thought, sent it back, rocks but my guys would rather have something more interactive with wheels"
5,One of the best sci-fi of all time.,"These books explore the nature of unbridled humanity better than any other works of fiction I have ever read. I believe the real value of these stories lay not only in there entertainment value (of which there is plenty) but more so in just what excesses and horrors we people are capable of. Read Nazi Germany, The Inquisition, Adi Ammin, and then throw these and other cultures into space, let em go and you have these stories. If we ever get of Earth and settle other planets on any kind of scale this is what it will be like.... Then theres the metaphysics (or are they physics) of ""strange attractors"". I personally believe in strange attractors and so do you. Seriously these are great books, five stars, read em."
1,"Surprisingly violent ""love story"".","I am a great fan of Giancarlo Giannini. He certainly is very handsome and has a cute body in this movie. But I didn't see anything romantic or funny about a man slapping a woman around to ""put her in her place"". Neither did my husband, who said, ""He hits her like it's nothing"". I'm still trying to understand why he hits her and why she falls in love with him. Giancarlo does have a beautiful face though."
2,Not a good choice to learn about the French Revolution.,"Rude throws facts at you constantly in such a way that it is extremely difficult to get a clear view of what is actually going on in the revolution. The quotes are still in French and translated in the back of the book which is just an annoyance to someone who doesn't know French. He also references to many people, places, and things to remember all of their relationships to one another. Just Pick another book to learn about the French Revolution."
3,"Beautiful scenery, annoying protagonist","I enjoy Kinsolver's descriptions of Arizona but the main character, Condi, just kept on getting the in the way of the scenery. I never grew to care about her past or her tough life or her inability to fit in. She spends the entire book wining and feeling sorry for herself when much of her trouble is of her own making!"
2,bad read,"The novel is unsophisticated, vulgar and unenlightening. It follows of the journey of hapless and unappreciative twenty-something where she travels back to her hometown and tries to ""find"" herself. It is hackneyed material and reading about the way the main character thinks makes you cringe at the sheer perverseness of it all."
2,good...but not great,"The book was well written, but there was nothing extremely exciting emphasized, therefore making the book boring, making readers think something cool is coming up, but there isn't."
3,"Finr writing, but a bit tedious at times","This is the first Kinsolver book I've read. Initially I was blown away by her narration- how she described things and the way she set the plot fot the events to come. She is a geat writer. That being said, just past the middle of the book, the story began to drag, and the descriptions and some of the scenes seemed superfluous to the story. I found myself saying, ""Just get on with it, already."" Another issue I had with the story was the way things came together and fit sort of well; it seemed a bit hunky-dory for my taste, which led to me doubting the reality of the story.Overall, a decent read. And if you enjoy vivid descriptions that are many, and if you enjoy stories with fairy tale like endings, then you'll probably like this book."
3,A little boring,"I think this author is amazing. Her writing is fab, but I felt a little bored in places. I think the story was very predictable, but I did manage to finish. I am not recommending this one."
2,what's all the hype about?,"After a few people told me how much they loved this novel (""Their favorite book"", etc.) I gave it a try. There's not much to it. It is not particularly challenging, stimulating or enlightening. It's not that wonderful as a bland romance either. I just don't see it."
1,Were I not afflicted with the vagaries of maleness...,"... perhaps I would have appreciated this work. I simply did not. After a great deal of reflection, I conclude that this book is pure pulp trash."
3,Book,"This book was assigned for Summer Reading. It is okay, but takes the life out of you to write a report on it. With this idea, it was an awful book. Also, there are some sexual scenes in it which I would not recommend for the younger audiences. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who hates reading romance novels. It makes me shudder to think that I read a romance novel."
5,Very cute Bed,"This bed couldn't be any cuter. I ordered two of them for my twin girls and they both love their new beds. Now, when I say it's bedtime they follow me happily to their rooms. The first week, they actually said ""Good night mom... Shut the door."" Which I guess was their cue for me to leave. My one twin who I used to have a lot of trouble with at night, now sleeps much better. Even when she does wake up, she is easily calmed and goes back to sleep quickly. She seems to be more content in this bed over the crib. The quality and style of this bed is great for the price. I would definitely recommend. Also, I put both beds together by myself without hubby's help."
5,WOW,"I'm not much of a writer, so I apologize ahead of time for the brief description. My boyfriend is actually the person who made me watch the movie in the first place, and I fell in love with it! It's a perfect blend between a chick flick and a guy's sarcastic comedy. Every person I have shown it to (guys and girls alike) has enjoyed it. This is one of those movies that you probably never heard of, but need to see."
3,Funny Film about SEX,"I saw this movie on TV a couple days ago, it was ok. Famke Janson plays Kate, a woman who has had way too many failed relationships. The movie ezplores her life and her new relationship that she started with Adam (John Favreau). The movie is pretty funny in the first half, but as it starts to get [boring] during the end and the characters become unlikeable. It's worth seeing once."
5,marley shelton's best,"the way marley shelton looks in this movie warrants the price of admission...dennis hopper even says that if she gets away with murder she deserves it because 'she is so wonderful'...her long blonde hair, southern accent, and those hot summer nights all add up to an image she either outgrew or discarded, and it's too bad...because this is her most attractive role, on par with beauties such as carroll baker in 'somdething wild', lee remick in 'wild river', anne francis in 'girl of the night', and even marilyn monroe in 'the misfits'..this movie may not be as immortal as those, but marley shelton's look is."
2,"""I-need-a-you-nit....to-sam-pull-and-hold""","I can almost hear a German accent in this number--and I can see why it's no longer available as a mainline US release. The closest equivalent is Kraftwerk's ""Man-Machine"" album. I really don't know whether or not ""Trans"" is a nod to the early techno style or a parody of it--not even the K-bots themselves overdid the machine aspect that much (""Man-Machine"" with its vocoder vocals was the most extreme). I only know that versatility can be overdone--if Young had less stature than he has, ""inconsistency"" might instead be the word. Maybe it's because of his contract with Geffen at the time--he commented when he got back with Warner that they had a bias towards techno-pop. Myself, I expect Neil to be Neil."
4,Weirdly wonderful,"I thought this was a pretty daring project for Neil to do at the time, and in retrospect it sounds even better. This album was pretty close to genius with its electro vibe and songs like ""Computer Love"" ... ""Sample and Hold"" ... the re-worked version of ""Mr. Soul."" Definitely not your father's Neil Young. But that's what I like about Neil Young; he's not afraid to take chances, push the envelope, do whatever strikes his fancy, and often what his fans are least expecting. Me, I like that unpredictable style. Take this album for what it is --- a real departure from the folky and rockin' Neil --- but still a delight"
3,"Oh man, this is really scary!!!","This would be a really good album if you knew the musicians did NOT take themselves seriously. If they were just SPOOFING the whole nazi rigamarole, if they were just PRETENDING to be neo-fascists, then you could sit back and listen to some of these admittedly inspiring numbers and laugh away any nagging guilt you might have about your dollars going to support militant anti-semitism. But LAIBACH is (or aspires to be) the real deal, complete with swastika-emblazoned gonfalons, brown shirts and jackboots. This is really scary. Frankly, I find them hard to take seriously, given that they cover a QUEEN number- I mean, that's like Carl Orff making remixes of Petshop Boys tunes. But still...you need to ask yourself- should your money be going to support the celebrity lifestyles of people who might even POSSIBLY be promoting neo-Nazi propaganda?"
2,"bought five watches, three doesn't run","don't know how long these watch has been in stock, the battery runs out and it feels bad to have to replace the battery when you just receives it. especially when these are supposed to be gifts"
1,"Good service, not a good product","Good service but I was so disappointed in this product. When I read about it, I honestly got the impression that I would get new information and have a breakthrough, didn't happen. I would not recommend this."
5,My 11 month old daughter loves this toy,"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday and gave it to her early. She absolutely loves it, she gets a kick out of pulling up the hood and putting in toys and taking them out. I push her all around the house and make noises and she just laughs. I would recommend this toy to anyone considering buying it. The most important feature is the seatbelt, it makes me feel a lot better knowing she can't fall out."
5,Baby's First Car,"Buggy is great, the baby loves it. Easy to put together.When we got it it was missing an axle, but this was due to Fedex. There was a hole in the box and the axle must have slipped out. I bought a steel shaft at Lowe's and made one because it was received on the baby's birthday and we wanted her to have it that day."
5,She Wont Get Off!!!!,"We bought it for our daughters 1st birthday and when it showed up, she fell in love with it and loves being on it. We have a hard time getting her off. It's an absolutely wonderful toy because if she wants to ride but I cant push, her two older brothers can push her because its easy to handle."
5,Best present at the party!,I bought this for my granddaughter's first birthday and it was the best present there. Everyone took a turn taking her for a stroll as she waved with both hands to all of us...she loves it!
5,Adorable,"My baby girl loves her car, and it is very hard to get her to play with any other toy. She loves going around the block in her pink convertible rather than her stroller."
3,Pretty Pictures,"I got this book cause I figured it would help me prepare some of my plants for winter and spring, the ones that I'm not as familiar with. I don't know all of their technical names and this has proven to be a problem for me. I can't find the plants I need and I know that they have to be in there, but there is soooooo much information in there and there isn't a photo with each one so I don't know whats what. I have found some of the plants that I already know what I'm supposed to do with them and the info is very good. I just need to take the time I guess and go through it page by page but I really don't have time for that. On the bright side it does have pretty pictures."
3,Say Hey?,"I read this book a few years ago, and was both interested in Willie Mays not only as a player, but as a man. Growing up a baseball player Willie Mays was someone to idolize, and with the way he played, this was easy to do. What was most sad about this book was the fact that Willie ended up a great career having little money to show for it, and had to become a greeter at a casino to make ends meet. One can only imagine how much money he would command now, and how he would be set for life in today's current baseball climate. If A-Rod gets $25 million a year, than Willie would get much more. This book gets points for being an honest look at Willie's life, from his own perspective, and for that I aplaud him. If you like baseball, you will like this book."
3,Or your wad...of cash,"Hooo boy!Ladies and Gentlemen, I loves the techno.Once you start 'singing along', making that robot pig sound, it's only a matter of time before there's a soft spot for the old shtuff both in and out of context. Early KMFDM is a perfect way to test your affliction as, even for the late 80s, I suspect they were using 2nd rate equipment.This album is fun, to the point of hilarity even, but very much a one trick pony. The point, therefore, is that it's 'rarity' only serves the people hopping you can't find it and the rest of their relics for the price of any other old used cd.I did, and so can you."
1,THE WORST ALBUM KMFDM HAVE EVER DONE,"I love KMFDM they are one of my favourite bands, but this has only 3 good songs ""No meat-No man"", Don't blow your top"" and ""Disgust"". The rest is all instrumental and BAD at that.AVOID and buy NIHIL and ANGST as they KICK..."
5,One of the BEST books on spirituality!,"I have MANY books on spirituality,buddhism,science and Yoga,and this book was a purchase required for my Yoga teacher training. However once I started reading it I was really happy to continue reading!it just is filled with everthing nessisary in helping you along your lifes path.Based on Buddhim at it's core,however it is not about Buddhism or teaching you about it's phylosophy. The author uses his knowledge and understanding and life experiences to help you along your path. The book leaves nothing un turned, it deals with everything! i have many books and there was still many things in the book that touched and moved me dearly.I would certainly recomend this book to ANYONE,it is a great book for anyone regardless of their beliefs.Try it and you will feel thankful you did!"
4,Velvet Glove,"Kornfield's book is so soft-touch that it's very easy to miss just how hardcore and no-nonsense a practice he describes and advocates, and just how pragmatic it is."
2,Complicated Book,"For those of you who are lazy to mow your lawn, this book is not for you. It's thick and too complicated. I personally find the exercises between each chapters obnoxious. Go get Open Heart... by Dalai Lama, it's much easier read, very inspiring, and good glimpse into Eastern Buddhism."
2,Requires Opening Holes,I had a similar chlorinator that was made by a different mftr. I was disappointed when I received this one because it does not come with holes in the bottom part. You have to poke holes in it yourself so that the water can get in and the chlorine tablet can activate. This was no small task because there are about 30 holes that I had to poke and the plastic is pretty thick. The instructions tell you how many holes to poke according to the size of your pool. The other chlorinator that I had came with the holes already in it and it also unscrewed so that you could put in the tablets. This one is a little awkward because you have to pull off the bottom part then force it back on. Just be aware of this before you purchase it.
2,"Basically Uno and Skip-Bo, but no download play!?!?","So the game itself is what one would think it to be. Uno and Skip-Bo. No surprises there, and it seems to have present the game on the DS reasonably well. However, it does NOT appear to have single card download-play capability. This seems really short-sighted, particularly for such a simple game and is why I choose to give it so few stars."
3,"Fun game, but redundant tapping...","I like the game just fine, but you have to tap a lot of timies that seem unnecessary in order to move cards. And it doesn't always take, so sometimes you have to do your move over and over again. But the game itself is a lot of fun."
5,"The book is beautiful, very informative.","I found this book very useful, very well illustrated, as Bert Monroy describes his technics. He teaches methods that opened my mind to the power that Photoshop CS has. While he covers many aspects of the program he dos not indulge in the usual rehash of every photoshop feature, focusing on specific projects. His reputation for a graphics artist and teacher are well deserved. Wonderful examples, just enough detail to convey the point without beating you over the head. Included color photos are well laid out, his teaching method couldn't be better. The tone will particular instruct the novice or intermeadiate user, but everyone will find something of use here. If you are looking for blow by blow 'how to' for every feature, look at Photoshop CS Sudio Techniques, or the Adobe Class Room in a Book. I only wish this book had more samples, examples. If you can't buy it, hope your local libray has or will. Do this for its artistic voice."
4,Just like I remembered...,These are those same stories I remembered watching on TV as a kid. Funny how they stand the test of time. Especially the Lorax. Dr. S was way ahead of the curve on global warming!
5,Never ceases to amaze.....,"I grew up on The Lone Ranger, I would get up early every morning before school, wiggle the antenna to clear the picture up and watch the old black and white series. This DVD has a few extra, but I really did not buy it for anything other than the movie.I teach American Literature and each we year we cover ""Realism and the Frontier"", Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Jack London, etc. The kids do ok with these tales, but I try to make the end of the unit a little fun for them. I bought this DVD because I knew it was a good clean family movie, and it would give them some of the same type story from the unit.They all think I am nuts, standing in the back of the room, singing every word to the theme song. But once the film gets going, they love it."
5,"Kemo sabe means ""trusty scout,"" and not what you've heard!",Thanks for the most excellent service! The DVD arrived almost overnight...Love my Lone Ranger!! He's always there when trouble strikes!
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The old adage certainly applies here. If you're looking for a high quality product, this is not it. The handle is very flimsy, the wheel does not work too well in rough terrain, but if you are looking for an inexpensive tool to make some measurements on smooth surfaces, this is more than adequate."
5,Quality is A-1.,"As described, great product, got excatly as pictured. Would buy again. Quality is A-1. What else need I say? I am well satisfied."
3,Good basic glass replacement,"So happy to be able to replace my original broken beaker. I wish there was an unbreakable replacement, as this is the second time that I have broken one. Still, can't live without my Bodums!"
3,It works,It's a little bigger in diameter than the original and a very tight fit for the holder. But it does seem to be a thicker glass than the original and will hopefully hold up better.
3,Too thick...,"I got several packs of these as a gift, and thought they worked well enough. Then I tried the Pampers Sensitive wipes and have not gone back. Trying a different brand made me realize the Huggies were a bit too thick to get a decent grip on and I ended up using more wipes for cleanup."
4,A different perspective,"Dr McDowall has done a good job recording and writing the dialogues he had with his spiritual guides on so many complex and controversial issues. The book has answered many of the questions in my mind, but this in turn has raised many more questions. I find some of the answers difficult to understand, but they were obviously more meaningful to the author because I was not privileged to the background of the questions. Overall I find the book interesting and stimulating."
4,Peapod delivers,"Got this for my 22-month-old twins for Christmas, and they love it. They can use it together or alone, and at less than three feet long, it doesn't take up the whole family room. And I couldn't beat the price!"
5,Great price,Lots of fun to watch and loved the price. We have had some fun family movie nights with Bethoven and his clan!
1,Bethoveen 3,"I didn't like this movie. The original 1 and 2 were better. After those two, the dog gets annoying. Also, I liked the actors better in 1 and 2."
1,Efashions Solutions,This dress is cheap and gaudy looking....nothing like it looks in the photo online. Also the expedited shipping is a rip off...they charged $18.00 for what was Priority Mail...I sent it back the same way and the cost was only $6.20.
2,Horrible,Doesnt work. I threw it in the Garbage after a week. It varies day by day and never consistent. Dont waste your time.
3,"NOT REALLY A MUST HAVE, BUT GOOD.","GREAT WATCH, BUT BAROMETER, AND ALTIMETER,,, NOT THAT ACCURATE, TEMPERATURE IS AWAY FROM REALITY, YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE WATCH FOR 10 MINUTES OR MORE, IN ORDER TO HAVE EXACTO TEMP! SO IT IS A LITTLE ANOYING...."
5,3 in 1 - A Picture of God,This book has the clearest explanation of the trinity I have come across. It's easily understandable by children or adults. A friend showed me this book at our Bible study and I came home and purchased it.
5,My 3-year old hasn't looked at an apple the same since!,"This book explains the trinity in terms that my 3-year old has come to understand. What an excellent tool in explaining how God protects, what faith is, and the role of the Holy Spirit. I will be packing this book for his overnite trips to grandma and grandpa's house to use as a witnessing tool."
3,"A bit oversimplified, although that may be the point","Overall I like this book. I think the author does a good job of trying to take an incredibly difficult concept to grasp (the Trinity), and put it into language that children can understand. There are a couple things I wasn't big on - I think on one of the pages, it says something like ""Jesus came so we can live beautiful, happy lives"" or something like that, which is.....kind of true, I guess. But try telling that to someone living in a closed and heavily persecuted nation, you know? But overall, a good little book."
4,Enjoyed the reading experience,Nice little book that new just how to draw you into the story and make you not want to put the book down. Have already recommended the book to others
5,Great Intro to Susan Howatch,"I read this book 20 years ago and have re-read it several times since then. I was drawn in to the book immediately upon opening it. I have read every novel of hers except the Church of England series. I love her style in which she tells the story from each of the character's perspectives. Does anyone know if she plans on writing another historical novel along the lines of this book or Penmarric? I can't get into the spiritual clergy theme of her latest novels, much as I've tried, and am ever hopeful she'll write a new novel similar to Cashelmara."
1,A Walk in the Clouds DVD,"I am very disappointed in this DVD. It came new and was given as a Christmas gift. When this item was opened and placed in the DVD player, it was not able to be read. After investigation the dvd closer, it is a European DVD and not able to be played in American dvd players. This should have been disclosed in the description since all other dvds purchased through Amazon were as expected and this one was not."
4,CHARMING!,"Keanu is soooo romantic and of course extremely hot in this movie. The movie itself is full of romance, passion and excellent drama."
5,movie,"This is a lovely movie. Clean no bad langueage and everyone can watch and enjoy it. We are so very grateful to K. Reeves for making a nice clean movie...especially when everyone in Hollywood seems to think the world like bad language, raw sex in the movies they watch. Sure wish they would go back to the time when they made movies tha showed suggestive, but not expisit.You can watch this with any member of your family and friends and not be embarrased."
2,Watch it once and then throw it away.,"This movie, in my opinion, was absolutely terrible.The idea for the film had good potential, however it did not live up to any of my expectations. It was very hard to be drawn into the story when the characters as well as the plot were so poorly developed. However, this movie did have an overall good theme about family and love.All in all, I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good romance. However, you will probably like this movie if you are either really bored, or if you are part of the Keanu cheering squad."
4,"Fine movie, not so good acting","Great scenery in the movie. The acting is not great, but the story flows, so you end up rooting for love and happiness after all."
4,Good movie,"While Keanu Reeves belongs to what I call the ""Paper Bag"" school of acting (namely, that is, what he couldn't act his way out of) this movie manages a sweet charm all of its own. I believe that many people have discounted this film mainly because of its star (who before recently was known more for playing Ted ""Theodore"" Logan than Mr. Neo ""The One"" Anderson). While the film may follow the traditional story of two people pretending to be in love and then actually falling in love, it is told in such a sweet manner that it's hard to find fault with it. Even I find myself getting caught up in the emotions of the film. This movie is filled with humor, drama and in the end makes a nice romantic film. However, if you're looking for hard hitting drama, or extremely though provoking dialogue and plot, this movie isn't for you."
3,More of a Documentary than a Concert Video,"Wow - I'm only giving this DVD 3 stars! Why? Well, it's NOT because it's not well done -- it is. When you consider how old alot of the footage is, you have to give credit to the producers of this DVD for making it so ""watchable."" However, it just isn't what I'm looking for in a DVD. [...] What I really enjoy in a concert DVD is a recording that makes me feel like I'm AT the concert. (The Fourplay DVD is an excellent example of that. There they are on stage with feedback and mistakes here and there -- it's just like really being there!) The Thelonius Monk DVD is much more a documentary. Also, I took a chance not knowing exactly what kind of music this artist performed. It is an older-fashioned type of jazz.If you like older jazz (1950's), and you're interested in knowing all about this artist's life, etc., then I highly recommend this DVD."
5,calification,excelente.:!! compra a tiempo y segura..!! 100% recomendado..!!! la compra llego a mis manos sin ninguna novedad..! la caja nomas q estuvo muy grande..!! saludos desde ecuador..!
4,Punkdustrial.,"This is one of those collaborations that pretty much sounds like just what it is. Ian McKaye of Fugazi fronting Ministry. As a longtime fan of both bands just the thought is exciting. The songs are too. Basically just a 6 track Ep, it's enough...but not too much. Trait is a real sound of the times. I'm not sure I can sell this any better than telling you who's involved.This entire release and more is also found on the Ministry collection ""Side Trax"". Can't confirm that it's remastered, but it might be more for your money."
4,this had to grow on me,"i bought this a while ago and really wasn't into it, but i've been getting more and more into lately. part of the reason why i gave it a second chance is because ian is absolutely my favorite vocalist ever. he's not the best vocalist ever, but he's f***ing awesome.anyway, into the review part of this. this is super monotonous, but in a really good foot tapping sort of way. i was never very into ministry and i think that this sounds nothing at all like anything al has ever done. this is definately a complete about face for ian.""man should surrender"" absolutely had to have been the groundwork for QOTSA's ""feel good hit of the summer"" and there is nothing wrong with that as both songs are pretty damn good.for anyone that is a fan of embrace, fugazi, ministry, queens of the stone age, etc.it's definately not the best thing in the world, but if you let it grow on you you'll find yourself bringing it with you in the car all the time."
2,"no good fight scenes, so yeah it sucks and deserves a 2/5.","Robert clouse is certainly one fo the worst directors of all-time, I mean it only took jackie like 17 years to be in an american movie again. I have to admit that jackie himself is very enjoyable in this movie, and so is the great mako. But the direction he is under fails completely. The only scenes that I enjoyed were the nonfighting action scenes like jackie roller skating, or looking at the white girl showing some nice skin. But this is not why I picked this up, it said that it was gonna be a big brawl and it sounded like it was gonna be a tournament, but once again robert clouse can't even make a better movie than china obrien."
3,Good For Beginnings,"This was one of Jackie's first American movies.It was slow and very silly at times, but to anyone not used to Jackies style, it would seem like a great movie.Don't get me wrong , it was good but Jackie probably didn't have much to say in this one when it came to fight scenes.Too bad.I saw so much potentional.All the others Hong Kong stars are glad that they still have jobs,except for Sammo,And Yeun Biao."
5,Tested and Tried Methods,"I love The Lost Art of General Management. It is easy to read,great real life examples of tested and tried methods. His message is simple, his delivery style is very friendly, with a lot of experiential wisdom. Great for entry level management and up; and for all entrepreneurs. You will not be disappointed."
3,Handy for a low price,"The CD in itself has no interest outside the music contained in it. If you're new to Blitz or just wanna have all the hits together in CD format, this is great, especially at a low price. The songs cover pretty much all of Blitz's different stages, from the singles/EPs to the full lenghts, from the initial raw streetpunk/oi! to their later post-punk output. Maybe a better looking artwork (if you can call it as such in the CD) would have been appreciated, but having so many well-chosen songs from the glorious Blitz in a CD for a low price is handy and worth it."
4,Good but tough,"I rented this game to see if it would be worth the buy for my 4 (soon to be 5) year old and I would say that it is a good game but it can be somewhat frustrating because of the graphics in the dark background. In the garbage level and other scenes where the background is dark it is almost impossible to see what is there. We got around this by playing at night and turning off the lights. I might buy this, but likely used from a store that had a good refund/exchange policy."
4,BOO!!,I really liked this game. I am not much of a fan of the other Monsters inc. games though. I also liked the fact that Boo was involed in the game. The videos were very enjoyable but the game was a little hard.
1,Review,The Trim works great but it only sits there and does nothing. We have the Sharp R-530BS micro oven what a piece of S___. Right after the warrantee was gone it started acting up. Not stopping when you turn it off. Starting again when you shut the door. The clock never shows the right time when you can see anything.So now I am looking for a replacement. Any reviews on the R-530-ES? Hopefully I can find something since our cutout is for the Sharp RK51S27 trim kit. Or will I be stuck buying another Sharp every 2 years just because it fills the space?????[...]
4,Unique singing voice is memorable,"I love the unique singing voice found in Editors. It's almost haunting sometimes. They lyrics are great and the music has true feeling to it, I can tell these people put a lot of time into their efforts.This CD is great for in the car, at home while working, chilling, or whatever. The songs are all different from one another, but tie into the overall band itself well. None are really boring or stale. It really is a worth-while CD."
3,"why can't they all be like ""all sparks""?","4 out of 11 songs are bonafied head bopping hits: ""lights"", ""blood"", all sparks"" and, to a lesser degree, ""munich"" are so good, they'll be on my favorites list forever. The rest is garbage that I won't listen to twice. Furthermore, the sound quality is truly ""indie"" (as in less than perfect indie). Borrow both this CD and their get ""an End has a Start"" off their second and you'll have enough songs for a great E.P., but this one alone isn't worth my money."
3,No Gift Box,"This set is pretty enough, although it has a cracked effect on the surface of the plates and soy sauce containers that looks a little tacky. But if you are buying this as a gift, it may not come with the gift box that the description includes. Mine was just wrapped in cardboard and paper."
2,One Read Only,It's an old book as the cover and the pages are quite brittle. The book is already falling apart and I've only had it 2 weeks.
5,Ranks with the best of good versus evil fiction,"As author of Project 314, I have a deep appreciation for the way that Lewis pits good vs. evil. In his space trilogy, Lewis ranks with Stephen King (The Stand), and Tolkien's ring series in the way that he reaches deeply into his imagination to allegorize the moral dilemma of man. From a scientific standpoint he is ahead of his time. Imagine Lewis' amazement at the way we keep bodies alive today!"
2,Very disapointing,"I am a huge fan of most of C.S. Lewis' work. I had to force myself to finish this one. His view of life (esp in regard to the main female character) was SO offensive and sexist, I threw the book across the room several times. I wish I had never read it so I did not know how far his views on women and there place went. I guess according to him the largest sin of a women is to be independent and get a job. Give me a break."
4,Great storytelling,"C.S. Lewis does a great job throughout the space trilogy in communicating deep, complex ideas through fiction. He will always be my favorite author."
2,The Office - Season 6 (Blu-Ray),"Love the Office, however I am very disappointed as I cannot get the 1st disc in this grouping to PLAY! I want a DVD package instead, but can't bring myself to spend more money on it."
2,Bad acting - weak execution,"The reason I gave this episode such a low rating is because it had the potential for being genuinely funny. The overall premise is great, however, the execution is lackluster. I have seen the cast do a lot better job of executing their roles with lesser plots in episodes that were way more funny than this one."
5,"Office, #6","Our whole family enjoyed this season. Who wouldn't? For me,this was one of the best series ever on television. So funny,"
3,Ok episode,This is an ok episode and the only thing that makes it memorable is that it is one of the series' Christmas episode. Were it not for the bickering between who gets to be Santa this would be a pretty dull episode but the Christmas theme manages to save it.
2,Did You Drink The Office Kool Aid?,A short review....I think that anyone who rates this above three stars has not seen the first three seasons for comparison. I do hope that season seven does not end up like this. Ridiculous plots and Michael Scott a letch and out of control... This is not the Office seasons of old. Buyer Beware!
2,Watchable but cheesy,"This movie seems very dated. Some 80s movies still play well, but this one seems to suffer a little more from time than others. The basic storyline about a kid who uses his savings to help someone find her future is kind of cute, but the details of the movie are cheesy be it the somewhat unrealistic photography angle, the gratuitous 1980s topless scenes or the obvious lip-synching of Demi Moore. There's just something about this movie that doesn't quite click for me, but it's still not too bad as far as old movies go."
3,Knob broke off too easily,"This is a handy unit, but the knob on the top was poorly attached and simply broke off without much force and with no way to re-attach it. Other quality units have replaceable knobs held on with a screw."
5,What a cute movie!,"This movie has such a wonderful title to begin with--a great conversation piece. Although this movie is intended for children, its humorous and heartwarming moments touch everyone."
5,Definately Worth Buying!,"Let's see, this movie is probably the third movie that Hollywood has made about a giant reptile. But I like it. I was fascinated by snakes when I was littler, and I just snake videos. I always would watch snake documentaries on animal planet and I read a lot of snake books. I was truly impressed by Anaconda, and this movie rocked my world! I liked it when the giant snake was in the plains and Casper Van Dien was sending his men in there but it killed them all, including Casper. Some of it was discusting, like the two lesbians at the beginning, that was not appealing to me. But the rest was because sometimes the python would appear suddenly and make you jump. Buy this movie, without a doubt, you'll love it!"
3,Anaconda [Imitation],"Python is the mistakes that Anaconda made times 2. It flashes a well-known cast, which are not even on the screen for more than 5 minutes. Robert Englund isn't even introduced until about half-way through the movie and Jenny McCarthey dies within 3 minutes! The plot is just riddiculous and there is no blood at all. The Opening scene with the women was rather tasteless but original. Basically it is a st8 to video snake flick with no plot that is fun to watch.OVERALL SCORE:77/100Plot:13/20Direction:15/20Cast:16/20Special Effects:17/20Fun:16/20"
2,Low grade film tries and terribly fails.,"I was interested in this film's appearance, because of the genre and the fact that Casper Van Dein was in it. First, the supposed lead actor is only in the film for about 20 mins and is killed. He is supposedly a top agent but fails in combat skills. Second, all the actors were misplaced and horrible. Third, I didn't get one thrill or even a scare from the site of this fake CGI snake. Fourth, the cliche of the monster vs. man reminded one of a failure 50's film that flunked on all scales. Bullets can't penetrate his skin, but one swipe from a pipe makes it bleed? The unrealistic film's drama is laughable, because it is so utterly despicable!"
2,Could've been better,In my opinion this movie could have been very good at least in sci-fi standards. The special effects ain't that bad for a direct-to-video but the bad acting and some events that make little or no sense makes it hard to enjoy for me. EX: The python was able to chase down a motor vehicle but for some reason it could not catch up with two bikes or simply chose to give up the chase its beyond my understanding. Maybe my expectations for this movie were to high after having watched the sequel wich was not a masterpiece but I personally liked better due to the fact that the snakes look slightly more real and the military had a bigger role in it in a better setting in my opinion. I just tought it was going to be more similar to its sequel.
3,Five Narrators Too Many,"Although _The Rector of Justin_ is considered by many as Auchincloss' best novel, I didn't like it as much as some of his other books. It uses six narrators to tell the story of the Reverend Francis Prescott, D.D. -- founder and rector (headmaster) of Justin Martyr, a fictional school for boys in Massachusetts. The narrative structure seems contrived to me; Auchincloss used it better in later books like _The House of the Prophet_. You never get to know Prescott well enough to decide whether you like or dislike him, although maybe it is Auchincloss' intention to create the uncertainty. None of the narrators arouses your sympathy (the main one is just plain annoying), and the book has no trace of sentimentality in it. In Auchincloss' autobiography, _A Writer's Capital_, he says the character of Prescott is based more on Judge Learned Hand than on Endicott Peabody, the headmaster of Groton where Auchincloss went to school."
4,"Good, Not Great","This is a very good work of fiction centered on Reverend Francis Prescott, founder and rector of a New England school. What is most interesting is the way in which Auchincloss builds his main character through the words of others. This technique, surprisingly, gives us a full portrait of the man and his times. Despite such a solid character study, what keeps this book from becoming ""great"" is the absence of some larger American themes (class conflict, race relations, political tension, etc.) I found this to be ultimately a personal story without much beyond the person."
4,Great Manual,"Very thorough, and descriptive. This is the manual to get if you want to start tinkering w/ your Intruder."
4,great book!,Great book ...touches on about everything you would want to know to get started in the right direction. The rest is practice practice practice.
5,Jackie28,I was looking all over for this perfume because I have really bad allergies and this is the only one that I can use without my eyes and noise becoming watery!!!
4,Soft Socco touches my heart,"Socco really touches my heart with his hard-soft-split ways of being. I enjoyed very much reading Mosleys previous books about Easy Rawlins. But Easy never became my friend - he was always very distant, untouchable, hard to get to know and not very sympathetic. Socrates is a sad lovely personality that I want to know more about. I like the use of dialogue and expressions and the simple appreciation of life from the viewpoint of the ex-con. Please Mosley, write some more..."
3,"Readable, not great, 3 stars","A collection of stories (some are more like character sketches) is just not as compelling as a book with one story would be, but the main character is interesting and the book is well-written and not as bleak as it might be. The author likes his protagonist, and you probably will, too, an ex-con with a strong moral code and no inhibition about expressing it. Made me want to read the author's other books, so it can't be too bad."
5,I learn from Mosely,"A friend gave me Mosley's book Walkin' the Dog, to show me what good writing was about. Mr.Mosley not only drew me in, but I wished I had received Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned first, just so I knew more about Socrates Fortlow and how he arrived. I've since devoured the stories in both books, and made them part of my permanent collection of greats. Mosley is a prolific writer, who asks you to walk beside him through the streets of Los Angeles, eyes wide opened, and nostrils flaring, and if you dare to, take in the sight,sound,feel,and smell of the Watts ghetto. Mr. Mosley deserves acclaim for his effort and moreso for his extraordinary success in the creation of Socrates Fortlow, his friends and foe. Mosley is a winner. If you can't learn from him, you aren't listening."
2,Is this book about MP's work or Alma Gilbert World?,"If I could have found a copy of this book to preview before ordering I never would have bought this book. Far, far too many pages and current photos devoted to the landscape surrounding his home. And as I said before, Is this book about the landscape paintings of Maxfield Parrish or is it about Alma Gilbert and her ties to his life? This book was a disappointment to me."
5,A book you can't put down and don't want it to end.,Man of the Shadow is a riviting book that you just don't want to end. The story of Eagle and his denial to fully accept the beliefs of the People is a wake up call for us all. There may be a Trickster out there waiting to fool us all. I thought Eagle and the Old Man were as unlikly to get along as the Head Splitters and the smell cat. It was amazing they wintered together and didn't come to blows. All in all it was a great book and I can't wait to read more of the Spainish Bit Saga.
5,Interesting Movie,"This is a very interesting movie, not to mention Steve Buscemi directed it. I disagree and agree with Kenecia; prison is a miserable experience - BUT this movie is based off a novel, it's not a docmuntary, so ofcourse is going to be ""watered down"" and have some unexplaineble weird twist of an ending. Kenecia, you remind of those people who watch cartoons and say "" WHAT?! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!!!""But for others, i recomend this movie. It's worth the time."
3,"Great sound, Great pain..","(REAL NAME)I think these sound great for the money, like more expensive hdphones. I work in sound and was suprised at how nice they were, very warm and detailed. Also I was suprised and annoyed by the comfort of these : non existent. only way they worked to seal outer sound was to clamp them as behind the head style and look ugly. The cups and foam came off in a month more than once and the cable in the band's glue came out. Not comfortable for more than 30 minutes.What a let down, I mean behringer did a great job with these drivers but would have been done a better job selling them with out the headband!Good luck...Comment"
3,not how they appear,"they are uncomfortable, and smaller than they looknot very good sound, short cordyou can get a much better deal on seinheiser headphones, they are cheap and bettermy friend has some, i wish i had bought those"
3,the smiths,"Rourke and Joyce moved rather quickly through the smiths years. i would have liked to have heard more about the albums and songs. they dicuss morressy and marr in terms of artistic abilities, but never go into detail or provide and refershing new information. The commentaries by other musicians were bland and off focus. I found it very annoying when they they used this cinamatogrphy every ten minutes.This may sound like a negative review, but I expected more inside information from two members of the smiths who were there to see it all.phil"
3,Illuminated Touch Screen Sudoku Puzzle Game,Game a bit too small for a man's hand. Grid lines poorly defined and difficult to keep track of the game. Grids should look more like they do in the newspapers and puzzle book. Otherwise not bad but not the best compared to others if have seen since purchasing this one.
2,Terrible screen causes eye strain,"Sodoku itself is a great, educational game that anyone who enjoys puzzles will love. Unfortunately, this game is very poorly designed and manages to ruin the fun of Sodoku. The game has several problems:1. The screen is the worst ever! You can't see the numbers except at a certain angle, and the back lighting doesn't really work. This game will strain your eyes and give you a massive head ache.2. The stylus that comes with the game doesn't seem to work that well. I used a pen and that worked better.3. The game offers no way to check a certain square. The only error check offered is for the entire board, meaning if you make a mistake but don't want to reveal all the squares, you are out of luck.4. No way to notate squares. You cannot put a note for possible remaining numbers for any square. This makes solving tougher puzzles really frustrating.Don't buy this game. It is worthless. Save your money and get a book of puzzles. Your eyes will thank you!"
2,A backlight would make all the difference.,"I just picked this item up today and wished I had read the review on it first. To be honest, I really like the everything about it except the fact that it can be very difficult to see.A backlight would make this a perfect unfortunately,the eye strain isn't worth it and you spend more time trying to see than solving the su doku.Wish that someone from the company that makes this read this and take the hint."
4,Very handy!,This is my second one. The first one I had a little brat smashed it (while his mom did nothing to stop him) anyways....I keep it in my purse and pull it out everytime I have to wait anywhere. Sometimes I play at night too. Good for the mind!!
4,I love sudoku,This is my 3rd and 4th ones purchased! Easy to use. Easy to carry. I play it everyday! I wear them out!!
1,Straight to Goodwill,"The Amazon reviews suggested that this product would be good for persons with vision problems, so we ordered it for my mother-in-law. Phooey. The numbers are small, gray-on-gray, the backlight does very little, and both of us (with good vision) find it hard to read. I am giving it to goodwill immediately. (Too lazy to return it)."
2,"Excellent singing, but the sound is unlistenable","The reviewer below must be referring to a different recording, because this radio broadcast from La Scala under Fernando Previtali wouldn't be acceptable on a car radio, much less at home. The young Martina Arroyo and Placido Domingo sound glorious, from what can be made out through the dimness and murk. Further comments are pointless given that the whole thing is unlistenable. both artist have made excellent stuido recordings of La Forza, which should be sought out instead of this relic."
5,Front by Front ~ Front 242,"When Front 242 released Official version back in the mid 80's people thought that this would be the best ebm album of the 80's. They were wrong. Front by Front is the best 80's ebm record period. With songs like Until death (us do part), Headhunter ver 3.0 and ver. 1.0, and in rhytmus bleiben they created a true master work. The sound is much more complex then on previous albums, the vocals are getting better and better and the samples have exploded in quality. This is an ebm album not to be missed by fans of ebm or for fans of Front 242."
3,A seeker of power with a touch of beauty,"I'm on a mission to find a band that has the beauty of Enigma or Enya, yet the power of metal. Front242 has a splash of both, with just enough power to get the listener a little pumped up."
5,spiritual warefare,I so love reading Peretti's books. I'm inspired to pray more with the reality of the battle of good and evil.I got the paperback version of it cause I like reading it and having it look used.paperback was a great condition. Still intacted.
5,This is an ouststanding story about good vs. evil,This is a great book to learn about the evil forces at wotk in the world. The story highlights how we must be aware of evil all the time.
2,"Intriguing content, crummy fiction","Some have described Peretti's writing as a cross between C.S. Lewis and Stephen King. Maybe so, but he's not nearly as good a writer as either of them. I can't recommend wasting time with this as the fiction was poor quality. Instead, read Lewis's ""Screwtape Letters""The Screwtape Letters: How a Senior Devil Instructs a Junior Devil in the Art of Temptationfor a much better-written story detailing below-the-surface spiritual warfare."
4,This Present Darkness,I think it is something that will stay with you. It may show some people who don't believe we are in spiritual warfare the truth.
4,Character also seen as important,"Though I've grown out of my ""dramatic battles of angels and demons"" phase, I still think this is a good book for the young-adult set. Though Peretti's moral focus is not as strong as that of CS Lewis' timeless classic ""The Screwtape Letters"" Peretti does have an ethical framework that prevents his flashy storytelling from turning into dangerous sensationalism. For example, Pastor Hank (the book's protagonist) is a loving husband and father, the head of a functional family, whose sermons focus on topics such as marital fidelity rather than fire and brimstone. Evil is seen not only in witchcraft, but in child abuse and drug addiction. Pastor Hank's flock has no political agenda. They use prayer and church debate, not violence and partisanship, to bring about the final victory. If you're looking for some hard-core moral instruction, go with Lewis. Otherwise, this book is harmless fun for those whose spirituality includes some dramatic flare."
5,Excellent Writing and Gripping Story....,"Ok, I admit that this is the first book by Frank Peretti that I have read. I could not put it down. The story starts off with a bang and keeps the reader interested in this page-turning epic of a novel.I've never been a big reader until recently, and I have read seveal books over the last month. From all the reviews I have read about this book, I knew it would be a great read. I was right. This book defines true Christian Story telling. The biblical themes are as real as the characters in this story. I look forward to reading Piercing The Darkness, Peretti's next novel!"
4,"Great, but unusual.","This is industrial at it's best. Although not too musical, they are incredibly powerful. With powerful drum and bass beats and a vocalist that sounds like Till lindemann of Rammstein, this is a very unusual band that some have difficulty putting into one genre (ubl has them listed as punk- trust me, they are as far away from punk as one band can get.)"
3,Emotion Without Substance,"I extensively mark books that move me, motivate me, inspire me, and instruct me. I have virtually no marks in this book. It reminds me of the communicators who know how to play with an audience's emotions, but when they're gone, there's no substance. This book will move you emotionally, but it doesn't really leave you any better off in the long run.Fulghum has the gift of communication. He can tickle your emotions, but he just doesn't say much when he's through. His book is full of personal anecdotes. Nothing wrong with that, per se. A lot of storytellers have made a fine living that way. If that's what you want, escapism, then you'll find it in this book. It's just that Fulghum and I apparently don't have the same worldview or appreciation for the same things."
1,What Was the Point?,"I read this long story/book in about two days, upon completion of which, I said to myself, ""What was the point of that?""Not only was it not really a crime story, but it seemed more like a writing exercise for King and not a complete work. At the end [*SPOILER*], you still don't know if the dead man was murdered, what he was doing in Maine or how he got there in the first place.For all of King's explanations in the afterword, that lack of a conclusion really irks me. And apparently a lot of other readers as well by the looks of the previous reviews. My message to King would be if you're not going to deliver at the end of the book, then don't bother publishing it."
4,good story,"Although many times in the book they said this wasn't a story, it did a great job reminding me of what Stephen King does best,tell a good story."
5,"No, it isn't exactly a ""Hard Case Crime""","Noir fans are justifiably dissatisfied. They way I heard it, the guys who started ""Hard Case Crime"" approached King to write the foreward to a novel. He responded by saying, ""I have a book for you."" If you were starting up a new publishing venture and one the world's largest authors offers you a book, would you turn him down because it wasn't quite what your imprint was going to publish? Of course not. And they didn't. I, for one, am glad they didn't.As a librarian, I have had trouble trying to convince people who are not horror, or King fans, to read this, even though I am sure they would enjoy it. He has built up such an image of his work that when he writes something utterly horror-free it can't get a fair reading.For the quality of the prose, and the depth of the relationships between the characters, I have read few novels on par with The Colorado Kid. If King wrote like this more often, I would have read more of him."
4,What disappoints:,"Mystery itself, usually. At least if you want it to be told to you, or to watch it on TV. I can think of hardly any satisfying mysteries out there, just ones that titilate me into coming back to them. In that way they are comforting. Like Bigfoot. This novel is also comforting. What hurts is simply that it ends (can we admit that?), and that you want more (as does Steff), and that you have to once again say goodbye to a few more likeable King characters."
2,Terrible ending,"Um, there IS no ending to this book. The crime remains unsolved, and the reader feels his/her time has been wasted. No payoff??? Look elsewhere in the Hard Case Crime series for WAY better stories."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad, Just...There","I'm one of the few people who neither loved nor hated this book. It was better than Cell, but it was more like a snack than a real meal. I didn't care that he didn't solve the mystery, but I did care that he didn't give us more to interest us on the way.I hope ""Lisey's Story"" is more fleshed out than King's last couple of books."
2,A Story about Not Solving Mysteries,"Picking this up, I thought it would be about an old, unsolved mystery that is finally solved. Spoiler - nope. It never gets solved. The story itself is based on the characters and how they live and dwell on old, unsolved cases, about how they can never just let them go. As a character study, it is interesting. As a story, a bore. I was frustrated by the end, felt like I had wasted a few hours of my life and for what? An unsolved case to remain unsolved? I see what King was getting at, I really do, but it still failed for me because at the end of the day I want answers and closure, thats why I read. Realistically, sure, there are unsolved cases, but we read to get that certain closure we cannot get in daily life, an escape with an ending. Will this story stick with me? Absolutely, but in a frustrating way. Bleh."
2,Mundane Mystery Makes for an Easy Read,"I am willing to bet most readers chose this book because of the famous author. Stephen King is a very talented writer and that talent is minimally displayed in this book, although I have given it only 2 stars.King fails in his most important job of character development. All three of the main characters are immediately forgettable. I think King could have done better with developing his characters. Also, the trivial twists and turns are painfully dull.Reading the book is like listening to a long joke where at the end, it is not even funny and you feel as if you had been cheated out of the time you spent listening.However, if you are looking for 2 hours to kill (yes, I am a slow reader, so you can easily complete this book in two hours), the book maybe better than watching TV.Plot:Two Veteran Newspaper publishers in a sleepy town on the Maine coast tell a story of the most baffling death they had every investigated to one of their new promising reporters."
3,Just a bit disappointed,I love the Haven series on SciFI and had hoped it would be a little more like it. I thought it was too short and lacked the mystery I was looking for.
2,Disappointing (w/spoiler),I happen to be a long time fan of Stephen King and I grabbed the book as soon as it came out. But even Stephen King should give us a story with an ending. Even he owes us that.
3,"Intriguing story, disappointing ending","It's a mistake to bill this novel as a mystery. It would be more accurate to say it is an unsolved mystery. I gave the novel 3 stars (more like 2-1/2 really), for the interesting characters, intriguing premise, and good pacing, but the ending just falls flat. Writers of unsolved mysteries (think Jack the Ripper or Lizzie Borden) give the reader their theories or versions of events -- that's the point of writing about an unsolved mystery, isn't it? If you are a mystery fan or a Stephen King horror fan, you aren't going to like this book."
4,Poignant Mastery,"The voices are verily realistic. Their slang is captured with the author's skilful ear and concise writing. They are two gentlemen being attentive to their younger counterpart at a tiny news agency on a small island. The schooling is unique and the girl has to use all her senses to determine the flow and outcome of the mystery being told. Taking place on an island the rule differs from the mainland, the girl quickly realizes. She listens with great interest about two teenagers finding a dead man on a beach. Dave and Vince take turn narrating where questions from the youngest of the three are welcomed and duly answered. It is up to Stephanie to fill in the blanks alongside the reader. The lively banters in the language of the locals prod the storytelling forward with magnificent ease of smoothness. Mr. King has come a long way in capturing his audience's curiosity and this time it is no exception. Nevertheless, the ending might not satisfy a lot of people."
2,Intriguing but left unanswered questions.,I found the story to be intriguing but it left many things unanswered. SK has done better.
2,Somewhat of a dissapointment after waiting for this release,"This book was OK, but I found it hard to get engrossed in the story and the ending was somewhat of a lettdown. It's like wathcing a 2 hour movie with no ending."
2,"Come on you're a King, not a kid","I'm a long time Stephen King lover, but this little story there's rarely anything to love. The characters are very one dimentional. The muder if you can call it that is decribed with great detail which everyone should expect of King. And that parts interesting, but little else. The solving process is so repetive as if written for a child.The Cover to this book looks so good, like who is this raven haired beauty, she looks like she could cause some trouble but no!! She just solves a murder for a small paper that no one really cares about and is not that interesting.It's a short read that should take less than three hours, if your a true King fan your going to read it regaurdless of what I say, this is more for those people that have never read King because his books are too big, and they might see this and go I've always wanted to read a Stephen King, well don't pick this up get something earlier please. This is not King or Bachman by any means."
2,Disappointing,I'm a huge Stephen King fan but this one was disappointing. A whole book based around a single conversation. None of the fun suspense I'm come to expect from King.
3,Short story,The story was hard to follow and didn't hold my interest as a mystery should. Otherwise just OK for trips in the car.
4,Bring back pulp/weird fiction !!!,"Even though i'm in my 30's, i love pulp fiction! I grew up reading Howard and Lovecraft and through working in a used book store i picked up on Jim Thompson, Charles Williams, James Cain, David Goodis, Charles Willeford, and more.Even though this doesn't seem to be 'strictly' pulp (it's more in the weird vein), i still recommend the book and urge you to support the Hard Case Crime series."
1,Starbucks in Denver?,This book is dreadful. It's easily the worst in this series. It's definitely not a hard boiled novel.But someone please correct me. How can there be a Starbucks in Denver in 1980?
4,unusual and unexpected,"Fans of King expect chills and horror--that's not at all what you will find in The Colorado Kid. There is a mystery and a few chills, but mostly this is a story of human beings who are well drawn and so real, after reading their story I feel that I know them. Since I once lived in Maine, I know how absolutely accurate is their speech and manner. King tells us their story with love, in careful and endearing detail. Quite unusual and not what you expect, but really worth-while."
4,Good as always,Stephen King has a writing style that just seems so comfortable to me. This book was no different. I almost immediately liked the characters and the mystery being unraveled. I was disappointed with the ending but only for about 5 min until I finished the Afterword.
2,Boring,"This is a tedious novel. It's only 180 pages long and I still had to push myself to bother finishing it. This is really nothing more than a short story padded out to short novel length and that's one of its many problems: The central mystery is uninteresting. The way it is written, 2 old men telling the story to a young woman, allows for no real action or confrontation. The 2 old men telling the story are irritating and long-winded, having much difficulty coming to a point, there is no resolution at the end and no point in the story being told. This is not a 'hard-boiled' crime novel as the cover suggests.I'm not really sure what this book is besides dull. Stephen king is a wonderful writer and it's enticing to see him try a new genre, but if anyone else had written The Colorado Kid, it would not have been published in this series."
2,Writers block or just a block-headed writer?,"I gave this book 2 stars - not because it was a bad book, but because it's only about 2/5 of a book. The story itself was more a a local color character study, and an easy pleasant read. The problem is the story was about a mystery, and finished up leaving it a mystery. In other words, the story went absolutely nowhere.King doesn't follow his own advice. One of the aging reporters in the story explains that nobody wants to read about a mystery that doesn't have a conclusion - leaving a story open ended leaves people thinking the writer failed his job, and they'd be right. King crapped out on this one - although in his self-important preening he takes the view that he did it right. No, Steve, you didn't.So, you get a quality 2 stars for the 2/5 of a book. You want the other 3, then get back to work and finish the damn story."
2,What the...?,"This is not a hard-boiled crime. In fact there's not clear indication of a crime at all, just an unexplained dead person. And it's certainly not hard-boiled. The recounting of an unexplained death 25 years later by two senior citizens is more a study in quirky New England personalities than anything else.Also, it really irked me that characters living in 1980 refer to Diet Coke, BlockBuster Video and Starbucks coffee respectively two, five and seven years before they could have ever even heard of them. (maybe King couldn't afford hiring a fact-checker)If you're a King fan, you might like this. If you're looking for ""Hard Case Crime"" (as I was) keep looking, there are plenty of great examples of those in this series. (Girl with the Long Green Heart is great!)"
2,Two thumbs down,"I've been a Stephen King Fan ever since I read Carrie. I loved The Shining with it's big old hotel high in the mountains and the madness that took place there. The Stand was a novel of epic brilliance.King has said that he doen't mind going for the gross out, and that's what Dreamcatcher did for me - grossed me out. But still, there was a story, a tale of the supernatural - or at least the unknown.Then comes the Colorado Kid. What can I say? It left me flat. When I read a mystery I eagerly wait the denoument. I want answers, a brilliant explanation. With the Colorado Kid, all I got was more questions. At the end I still wasn't sure if the death involoved was accidental or murder.I think Dorothy Parker said it well: ""This book shouldnot be easily put down, it should be thrown against the wall with great force.""Come on Stevie. You can and have done far better than this!"
2,The Colorado are you kidding me?,"I can identify with all you rabid Stephen King fans out there, as I am one myself. Most of you would agree that the master of horror couldn't write something uninteresting if he tried. This book has few bright spots however, and none of the ""I can't put this book down"" feel that is common to most of Mr. King's work. It is short enough that readers should make it through to the end, but what is waiting there to reward them is no prize. Mr. King's popularity sets him into a unique place. He can publish anything, and book sellers and loyal fans will eat it up. Because of this, I think he is toying with his readers, as an experiment. What he hopes to learn by this experiment is beyond me, and I am not happy to have been a part of it. Read this book if you feel you must, or if you have read everything he has ever written, but be warned, it is not up to his usual standard."
1,expensive,"Works perfectly fine, but the replacement beaker costs almost the same as a brand new press. should have bought a new press instead and had a fresh plunger assembly to boot!"
2,still not strong enough,"Broke my 1st beaker banging my grinder on said beaker trying to get all the grinds out... #2 broke when I accidentally knocked the press pot off the counter. The beaker isn't strong enough for my style. ""Hey Bodum"" Just saying a thicker glass would serve me well."
3,"Love/Hate - Love french press coffee, HATE breaking these!","I'm on my third replacement beaker because these things are SO easy to break! I love the taste of French Press coffee, but I wish they would make these things a little bit more durable! The problem is, in order to get all the grinds out of the beaker when you are cleaning it you end up tapping the beaker on the side of the garbage can. Do this enough times and you will DEFINITELY break the beaker. I speak from the experience of breaking three of these things. You'd think I would have learned a different method of cleaning it by now, but nothing you do seems to get ALL of the coffee grounds out of the beaker. Oh well, I guess it's just something we will have to live with as long as we love French Press coffee..."
3,Ok-now how do you get the thing out?,"What am I missing? I have the worst time trying to get my beaker out of the plastic holder. I can't just leave it in, because stray grounds get stuck between the plastic and the glass and it looks ishy. Is there a trick to getting the glass out to clean? Everytime I manage to wiggle it out, I am prepared for it to shatter. I can't seem to find any info on how to do this the right way. Can someone offer advice? ThanksBodum Bean 8-Cup French Press Coffee Maker, 1.0 l, 34-Ounce, Orange"
4,Very Disappointed,"The replacement beakerI ordered was good but did not fit my coffee press so I sent it back w/all the paper work a week after receiving it..Then I get an email stating that so much was nonrefundable deductions with shipping, etc. So with a 10.95 item I was refunded 1.80! Had no idea that would happen. Not too interested in ordering again. Very upset about this. I could have kept the beaker and used it but wasn't a tight fit..not knowing that I am paying fees for something I don't even have!"
3,Just broke my second one in two months,"I give up. After breaking the first due to my ignorance regarding removing the grounds keeper, I replaced with this carafe. I just broke it trying to gently remove it from the stainless cage.No more- I am replacing with a Ceremony Beehouse Dripper."
3,Broke for no reason,"This was a replacement carafe. Our first one had cracked and eventually broke from tapping the tea pot on the edge of it. Woops!! So we got this replacement and it worked great for a while. We were really careful with this one after the experience we had with the first one. Well, after several months of satisfaction this one broke. For no reason. It was sitting on the counter in the evening time (had been there all day) when suddenly it just cracked. I heard it from the living room and knew it was glass breaking, so the first thing I checked was the coffee press, and that's what it was. So I bought a shatterproof coffee press this time because I am tired of replacing this carafe every couple of months. Hopefully the shatterproof one will offer me more satisfaction."
3,QC was off on this one!,"Ordered this as a replacement for a Bodum Chambord 8-cup press that I cracked. Verified that this is the correct part number for my press. Quality control must have been off on the one that I got. I followed the directions to replace the beaker for a Chambord (unscrew the frame and handle, replace glass, put back together) but the beaker is about 1/8"" smaller in diameter than the old one and doesn't firmly stay in the frame! I intend to swap the one I was shipped with a new one. I will update this review with the outcome. I really don't want to spend another $30 for a new press.===Update 09/05/07===Amazon sent me the replacement which was noticibly taller, but fit marginally better. After some very gentle and slight bending of the frame, the replacement beaker fit much better. After a few rinses of hot water (which they say loosens and forms the glass slightly... for what it's worth) the beaker was nice and snug once again."
4,Perfect fit,"Perfect fit in my Krupps press. As has been mentioned before, Bodum's beaker sizing is a little misleading. The 8-cup size is your average-sized press and means 8 4-oz ""cups,"" not the normal 8-oz cups. 4-oz is a pretty small cup of coffee; seems that most mugs are about 8-oz. So if you're thinking, ""I never get 8 cups of coffee out of my press, it's more like 3 or 4 full mugs,"" this is probably the right caraffe."
5,Perfect replacement at a fair price!,"We had our press for nearly two years before breaking the glass, and I was very pleased to find that we didn't have to pay for a whole new press! This fit perfectly in our 8-cup model and is just like the original. Good value!"
3,A little disappointing,"Dissapointed with this video. It has a lot of good stuff, but I don't think that it presented the BEST of Victor Borge."
2,Cynical and Pessimistic,"Where is the contemplation in this ""classic""?This book, though an interesting insight into one man's thinking and life journey, certainly did not seem to merit the hype it has received.It seemed very whiney and a little condescending, talking down to the reader. If the world annoys you, Vonnegut, work to improve it, or better, your view of it, rather than complaining to the world! Cat's Cradle seemed like an explanation of one man's depression and corruption so we could understand, even agree with him. I am certainly not saying the world is perfect, but if you are looking for a pensive and melancholy-toned book about its problems, I suggest ""Demian"" or ""Fahrenheit 451"" and others of Bradbury's classics. In comparison, Cat's Cradle is merely a collection of a cynic's complaints creatively assembled."
3,"Good, but I was hoping form more","The writing is very good and elegant and it worths reading the book only because of that, but the story is something else. The first half of the book is brilliant. That's the part which takes place in US, while the narrator is interviewing people related to Felix Hoenikker, the father of the atomic bomb. The book is full of interesting phrases and has a sharp insite into social life and relationships. But when the plot moves to the ficional island of San Lorenzo, the interesting stuff became rarer and rarer and what was intelligent and funny became dull and boring. Sometimes I had the feeling I started reading a certain book and finished reading a completely different one."
5,you'll either love it desperately or hate it desperately.,"cat's cradle, like all of vonnegut's books is a rather odd little piece of work. it's bitingly cynical, deeply depressing, and yet seems to convey a fragile sort of hope all at once.this book was written as a critique of what mr. vonnegut referred to as unethical scientists, people so concerned with what they might possibly be able to do that they don't stop and think what the consequences of their actions might be. it's rather effective at this in my opinion, creating a scenario that is silly and terrifying all at once.it's a harsh book, and some people will find that the almost fluffy humor grates with the dark premise and sometimes nasty characters. some people will love it deeply as it showcases vonnegut's ability to hate what humanity is and yet care what becomes of it at the same time.even if it turns out to not be your thing it's probably worth the read."
5,Big Vonnegut fan - my favorite,"I've read all Vonnegut's books. This was the first one I read, and it's still my fav. Breakfast of Champions comes close, but this book is still his masterpiece in my mind.Anyone who sees this world from the half glass empty principle will love this book. I laughed out loud repeatedly - Kurt just cuts through the crap and writes the most basic concepts of life at point blank range - he really knows how to make us see things for what they truly are.I'm not going to bore you with what I got from the book or what you're supposed to think. I think that what makes this book great is that you'll get something out of it no matter what your belief structures are or what your background is. Read this book and decide for yourselves."
3,"ok, but lacks the fun of his other sci-fi novels","There is much less humor in this Vonnegut novel than in many of his others. The characters are also less interesting than those that apppear in his other novels and plays, though there are some that reappear such as the God-guru Bokonon. I just found this novel kind of wierd, and then the apocalypse was sudden, etc. There are many of Vonnegut's typical themes: socially inept people (""losers"" in the glitzy American sense) who gain positions of influence/power in obscure places and try to do good, banal science that started out inadvertantly and became very deadly, and speculations about how people should treat eachother. It is an odd conglomeration.Tepidly recommended."
3,Not sure where to go from here.,"Good, not great. Bought Slaughterhouse-five. Unsure if it's worth reading. Pretty sure he covered everything he had to say in this one."
5,One of the best scifi's ever,"I first read this book in Jr. High, and have read it several times since. It has been one of the most influencial books in my life. It's a great read, fascinating in many respects, and blends politics and religion, which makes it still as relevant today, if nor more so."
5,Superb,"This is one of the most eudite and insightful books ever written on the topic. Shows how the modern mind has become so thoroughly currupted by Calvinism. The topic is still relevant to-day but since the book was written decades ago, current events could not be cited. To get the full effect from the author's thesis the reader has to read Pat Buchanan's ""The Great Betrayal."""
5,Inspirational Chess Movie,"It is a great movie to help inspire students to play chess, but would have like to have it in DVD."
1,Too slow!,"It is filmed at too slow of a pace. I don't think I could actually walk that slow if I tried. I can put it on fastforward, but then I lose the sounds and the music. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,not very pleased,"Not pleased with his product. It says ""LARGE camera pouch"" but even a medium camera (Panasonic DMZ 18) will not fit into it."
4,I do not normaly read mysteries...,"I am delighted to have encountered this book, which I received as a gift. I do not normally read mysteries and pulled this from a stack of ""when I get to it"" material to keep entertained on a recent business trip that was just too long to read work-related ""stuff"" from my PC or PDA.Ms Feder's writing is crisp and plotting tight... and the characters authentically demonstrate the coastal Connecticut milieu which still makes my skin crawl after 25 years of residence. This was a ""ripping good yarn,"" and I look forward to actually purchasing her further works."
3,It's an ok bag,Self weight is more (even though its lowest on the market).Can't be used as cabin luggage because half allowed weight in flight is bags weightBut it's a strong and good bag for other usages.
3,Handy Travel Bag,"This High Sierra travel pack is well made and very sturdy. The handles are padded which is nice and the zippers seem strong. I like the compression straps to cinch things up when you finish packing. The bag is ideal for a short trip, but the interior space is rather limited as the bars from the pull handle take up some of the interior space (as with most bags). I have not used the backpack straps yet, but think they will be handy at times. Overall a nice bag for a short trip."
1,"""Infononsense"" is more like it ....................","Such a promising title is turned into such a waste of time. It amazes me that the author of a good book like ""The Maths Gene"" could immediately follow it with utter rubbish like this. He seems to have been beguiled by praise and attention.With maths he is on solid ground. With language and information he is drowning."
1,High School Band Recital,"I purchased this CD based on (1) It's price (2) the other review Iread. With all due respect for the other reviewer, I would be embarrassed to put this on for a party, dinner, etc. I really wanted to like this CD, but I just would not recommend it. It sounds like the corner neighborhood band, or a band at a local lodge event. Save your money....I'd buy one of the many 'Ultra Lounge' CD's...I think you will be much happier!"
3,Alright,The movie was pretty good I only bought the movie because it was for an assignment so I didn't really get to enjoy it. Overall the movie was pretty good I don't have any complaints to make.
2,Martin Scorsese is responsible for...,"...several important classics in the moviehistory, but it's even hard for me to give this movie 2 stars. Only because of good acting, and some visual ""events"" of the production I give it 2 stars. I hated ""Gangs of New York"", but this was bad.Personally I didn't find it the least bit of interesting, but the problem (the main problem) that made it even worse; ""The Aviator"" would never end! Watching it with some friends that thought it was ok, well, I had to finnish it.I will never, never watch this movie again! Never!"
4,A surprizing success.,"My sister dragged me to this movie and I was all 'who wants to watch that goofus leonardo dicaprio in a howard hughes suit' but the movie worked. By the middle of the picture I believed di caprio was Hughes and I was rooting for him. Kate Blanchet looks more like the fish in 'Shark Tale' than Katherine Hepburn, but she does a fantastic job sounding and acting like the old girl.You won't learn much from this movie, but it does make you curious about the life and times of one of our more eccentric citizens. The performances and the direction are superb. The one thing I would change is casting that goofy Alec Baldwin as the head of Pan Am. He seemed a little farcical in an otherwise serious film."
5,Amazing movie!,"I knew nothing about Howard Hughes before watching the movie, and I think this movie did a good job of introducing me to this historical figure. DiCaprio did an amazing job, his acting talents never cease to amaze me! Wonderful movie!"
1,Lousy portrail of Howard Hughes,To portray Howard Hughes as an crazy idiotmakes no sense. He was a pioneer in aircraftand aerospace and didn't get there my osmosis.In real life he became a strange recluse afterhe was disfigured in a airplane accident were hewas the test pilot of a new plane for the military.He bacame addicted to pain drugs after the accidentand died a recluse. The movie in typical holywood fashionmakes him out to be an idiot from birth and ignoresthe contributions for technology and medicine thathe and his companies were responsible for. They donot even show the Humana Hospitals that he was responsiblefor or anything on the Glomar Explorer.. There are about30 minutes of strange behavior which dragged on and couldhave been covered in 2 or less. Save your money ...the aremuch better movies out..Bob
2,WAY OVERRATED.,This had to be a slow year for the Oscars . The movie is slow paced and DiCarprio is hardly a good actor .
3,"Great acting, average movie","This movie is worth seeing becuase of superb acting of Leonardo Di Caprio. For a past 2 year he's been establishing himself as one of the important actors around. His performance in ""Catch me if you can"" was brilliant, but in ""Aviator"" he surpasses himself. His acting is superb. Especially in the second part of the movie.In general the second part of the movie is much better. The first one is kind of boring and you don't know where it is heading to. Second part is interesting and acting wise and directing wise it is even more thrilling.As far as the movie in whole, it is nothing special, so 3 stars at maximum. Di Caprio can win the Oscar though."
4,Milk and Airplanes,"Well-done, well-acted film, but WAY too long. Good overview of Hughes life as a young man and the beginnings of OCD. Apparently his mother taught him as a young boy how to spell QUARANTINE, told him of all the diseases, and that he was not safe. If that hadn't happened, we're led to believe, he would have been just fine. Perhaps a genius when it came to airplanes, just couldn't get it together in his personal life.This film could have been a lot shorter, OR it could have been more complete in Hughes' biography. Overall, interesting."
2,Not Worth the Hype,"This was a very choppy movie. I understand that Mr. Hughes was a busy and complex man, and that the movie spanned years of his life, but there was a serious lack of continuity. Events jumped from one time period to another without clarification, events and issues were left unresolved or briefly hinted at then dropped, and the end felt particularly abrupt. Not what I'd hoped for in a highly acclaimed aviation movie."
3,The Aviator,"Good job of props, casting and acting however this movie tends to trivialize the life of a great man. I felt it should have spent more time on his vast acomplishments and less time on his physical/mental ailments which only became apparent in his later years, not early on as the film seems to suggest. I know, because my Grand Father worked with him on the HK-1 (Spruce Goose)."
1,Not the origional artists !,"I bought this CD as a memory of my youth and the great one hit wonders.However,I was very disappointed to find out this is not the origional artists,but,rather,another studio group(Hit Factory) trying to sound like the bands.I deeply regret this purchase.Ask seller first if this is with origional artists or a cover band.Do not buy this CD !!!"
5,"Good Pack, Bigger Than I Expected!","I ride a bike a lot and use this pack instead of a bike bag for carrying everyday stuff like bike repair kit, reading glasses, wallet, etc. as well as a faily large digital camera and my ipod. With some packs of this type I've had problems with the clasp on the belt popping open when I'm riding, this one is nice and solid and has stayed firmly closed. I also like the way the pack feels on my waist, it's very comfortable and tends to dissapear after a while. The water bottle holders are useful althogh I only use one the other one tends to end up with a snack shoved in it. Overall construction seems very solid so I'm sure I'll be using this pack for several years. A lot of pack for the money!"
4,Enjoyable Too,"Thought it would be much more heavy and academic. Is an easy read without dumbing down. Great for getting you going again if youhave ""fallin off the wagon""."
3,Difficult to read!!,"I do not advice non native English speakers to purchase this book, unless you want to use dictionary to figure out every second word! I just recently finished reading Documentary Storytelling for Sheila Curran Bernard, that book is readable, the writer there is demonstrating her knowledge in the subject of the book, but the ""ranter"" here is demonstrating his knowledge of English word's.But that's just my opinion."
4,"Good, cheap, easy to use.","For someone who had never wired a bonsai before, this is more than enough, and good enough to do the job. I still have most of it left after several months. Good, cheap, pretty easy to use."
4,Plain and simple...,"My Sins, My Sins, My Savior brings the reality of ones spirituality to light. Mr. Jeffress take basic biblical entries and connects them to the spirit of man; the spirit that causes man to struggle between good and evil.The book highlights, if Christians realize that a man is born into sin, he/she can also realize that the Son of God can release us from the bondage of sin. Jeffress illustrates this as he references biblical text such as I John 1:7. Our faith in Christ will facilitate our freedom sin.Mike Jeffress offers Christians a very simple and plain text that can accompany both personal and group bible study options.-LC"
1,Unbearable sound,This live performace is without doubt one of the most intense and moving of all Tristan recordings ever made. But in this particular issue the sound is unbearable with distortions in all climaxes and at all higher notes. Try to find another issue.
1,I need to know this song.,What's the techno song that plays when Jennifer and Jackie Chan are dancing after they come out of the underground pool lab and is still playing when Jennifer gives Deatrix the tuxedo?
2,1 track missing on the soundtrack,"What about the sexy song that played in the hotel bedroom scene, where Mia Cottet was seducing Jackie Chan...What is the title of that song????????"
3,A typical read!,I thought this book was a little on the boring side. The events were preditable just like the end. There was really no exciting parts. The only conflict between Zach and Abby was that she couldn't be accepted in the white society.
1,Ludicrous,"CD/abridged/Thriller: This was book 18 of the Dr. Alan Gregory series, which I had never heard of. This book read more like a cheesy Patterson book. A bloody body is found dead in a theater and it looks like the killer may actually be a group of people enacting the murder on stage. Some may be watching the murder while masturbating; tho outlandish. Alan is brought to the scene and asked to help the police with a profile. Of course, Alan gets in over his head looking for the murderers. Just....skip it."
2,No way the killer fits in this one.,"I enjoy Mr. White but this one just doesn't cut it. Every book requires the suspension of disbelief but this time he asks for too much and then he doesn't deliver the goods. We're to believe that this particular killer could lift a dead body up and dump it into a cement mixer? Or that this killer is strong enough to suspend one of the victims from his feet with a sword? Not to mention that all this fancy and bizarrely sick killing is done by someone that has been otherwise a model citizen up to now? The psychology just doesn't match. Not buying it. I could go on and on about the other implausibilities. The least of which is that this killer had all this time to slip off unnoticed to do all the killing given their role in the story. Come on, Sam would have noticed. I can't believe this one got by an editor."
3,Kinda cheap but so is the price.,"I have a very big couch and needed something that would cover it completely. This did not do the trick and strings started coming off immediately. It's a cheap blanket but what can you expect for $20. I had to get another couch cover, but I'll keep this too."
5,It Works,"It's cheap, it's sturdy. It's blue on one side and black on the other. It's a good buy. Now Im going to see how it washes."
1,Something very weird about these blankets,"These blankets are rather industrial looking, but I knew they would be. On a positive note - my dogs like them and the colors are acceptable. I bought them because I have been looking for couch protectors for a long time, and most that are made specifically for dogs are very expensive.What I can't stand is that these blankets are made in China (not mentioned anywhere in the description) and they are disintegrating in the wash. I've washed them multiple times, and each time there are wads of very fine fabric dust all over the dryer walls. I have to wipe out my dryer with damp paper towels each time I wash one of these. Makes me wonder what type of toxic dust is being emitted every time you touch one of these. I am going to dispose of them and buy a couple of the expensive throws made in the U.S."
2,Moving blanket pretty ugly,"By the image you would imagine the possibility of getting a somewhat attractive blanket. Don't count on it. I'm glad I only ordered one because it is pretty ugly. Probably will last a long time for a pet blanket, but I was hoping for something attractive enough to throw on a sofa. Not so much. The one I got is dark brown on one side and pieced together 3/4 brown and 1/4 pale blue on the other with rather an ugly seam and a bright electric blue trim. I will keep it as it's too heavy to send cheaply. Live and learn..."
4,Old school meets new school with a groove,"I love this disc. I got it as a gift from a friend who went to the CD opening party and I haven't taken it out of my player yet. Rocky, bluesy and great slide work on this and I love the singers voice. Like I said before its where old school blues and rock come into the new millenium. Great driving music!"
4,A long awaited Goblin soundtrack.,"For once, those who think that they know everything are actually on to something. I agree fully that this is an excellent soundtrack. It was unavailable for too many years. Cinevox has done an excellent job of putting this CD together, including the full score, alternate takes, and sound FX. This is what Goblin's all about. It is dark, scary and melodic, something that cannot be said for the movie that this score was written for. If you can trust me, a green fan of just 10 years, then don't hesitate! Buy this CD right away. If you need better credentials, then there are fans out there with 10,000 light years of experience who are FAR more qualified to present their opinions. Just ask them!!"
3,Wait for the new one,I really like this artist's work. Especially the work he's done in the past few years. This book might have been better if it contained the artwork alone however.The writer is not the artist and makes dozens of references to artwork which is difficult to reference because there are no page nos.associated with her descriptions or the art she's talking about isn't even in the book! There is also no index..so good luck. I hope Targete plans on a publish a new collection of his art soon as he is very prolific. Hopefully the next one will be better organized and self narrated.
1,Have not Reccived Them,"I have yet to reccived tham so I can not review tham till I reccive them.Thank you, Robert Butz"
3,Good title. Maybe I will stop French -bashing.,"The French are to be pitied. Lots of rationalization for losing the war. They did lose their war. They just ended up on the winning side. Lots of rationalization why their army lost to a smaller, inferior force, why there was so many colaborators& the fiction that Vichy was anything but a puppet-state. On that note it is to Britain's & the United States' shame that they ever acknowledged it's existence or it's leaders. The alternative was to recognize the only man among boys, namely Charles DeGaulle. A son of a bitch to be sure, but recognizing him eariler would have saved England & the U.S. a lot of grief later. De Gaulle does not forget & does not forgive...ever.This is all history. A painful & depressing movie (perfect for Woody Allen's character). I was embarassed for the French.I recalled a line from Catch 22: ""It is better to live on your knees than die on your feet."""
5,Amazing. This film will astound you.,"I have watched other films/documetaries about WWII, but this film gives you the story from a unique angle - from the point of view of the French people who were under occupation. We hear accounts from people of all walks of life, describing their situations and circumstances and how the events affected them. Some contradict others, but taking the movie as a whole, you get a pretty accurate account of what life was like.Highly Recommended.The price of the DVD may seem a little off putting, but unfortunately, due to its limited availablity, it seems the only way to see it is to buy it. Do what I did, buy it, watch it, then sell it on."
1,law school entrance essay prep,"There was nothing unique about this book. I bought 4 different books to help me write my personal statement. They all said the same thing with the same insight. Talk about plagarism. They weren't word-for-word, but the gist was the same.Save your money and buy only 1 book!"
4,Works as described,Works very well. If your going to use it a lot then purchase the all metal version. There is some wear and tear on the plastic.
4,a bit abstract but sometimes useful,"Although this book was often a little too abstract for me, it was nevertheless not completely useless. For example, I especially liked Bonder's treatment of difference. On the one hand, he emphasizes the value of being able to honor the differences that are part of nature. But at the same time, Bonder notes, rancor can arise from ""a lack of sensitivity when expressing our differences in others""- a betrayal of harsh truths, or a tactless overemphasis on difference."
1,Go for the upgrade,"This basket was just what I wanted. Unfortunately, it was packaged poorly and arrived damaged. I sewed twine all the way around the rim for reinforcement, but pieces of straw still keep falling off. The varnish is uneven, part of the basket is unfinished and part is a yellowed varnish. The leather straps seem old and dusty particals keep coming off in my hands. I'll be surprised if it lasts more than a few weeks. Go for the upgrade! This is junk."
2,Don't Be Fooled,"If you are looking for an alternative rock CD like Good Charlotte, this is not the disc for you. ""Fool the World"" and a few other tracks are good, but the rest are horrible hip-hop songs. They sound like a cross between Eminem without the swear words, Will Smith, and an extremely tiny bit of Linkin Park. This disc is also very short, only 38 minutes long. I would much rather reccommend Good Charlotte for an alternative rock CD, or Linkin Park for a hip-hop/heavy metal/rap CD. Don't be fooled by Good Charlotte's endorsement for this CD. The only reason they are endorsing it is because Benji and Joel are singing background vocals on 2 of the tracks. The CD was really a disappointment. Please don't be fooled."
1,A real hoot!,"This CD collection is one of the most bogus seen. Gothic music? Industrial music? Maybe; but this one seems contrived. Fanatic fans will find it okay, but this one left me cold. Maybe TKK should work longer on their stuff, and perhaps listen more to the master: Trent Reznor."
5,Quick draw,"I am happy that the product arrived and was what I expected. The picture is not clear whether it is a true double draw holster.I tried it on and was able to get it set up quickly. A picture diagram to show how to adjust the holster would be nice, but I managed without it.The holster is a solid design and should last many years. It fit me well, and has a the ability to be adjusted in or out to fit small or large frames. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,I'm in double love with this rig!,"I bought this with a couple other shoulder holster rigs from Amazon. I already have tactical vests with cross draw rigs on them and two drop holsters by UTG also from Amazon. I love this rig the best. I'm going to modify it with a couple extra magazine holders. It fits my Heckler and Koch USP .40 S&W I just bought last week extremely well. I plan on buying a second gun for the off-side. I can shoot left handed but rarely practice it. I'll have to work on the double cross-draw though. I will say none of the rigs I bought at Amazon were cheap quality. I liked each one of them, but this one is my favorite! Any rig that can easily hold my USP, my Taurus .357, my 1911 .45 is worth the money."
1,BEWARE!!! NOT AN E.L.O. ALBUM!!!,"For some reason, Amazon has mistakenly listed this as an ELO album. It is NOT. This is an album by ""ELO, Part II"" the band of ex-members and non-members, playing the songs of the original group. Jeff Lynne, the composer, arranger, singer and guitarist of all the music of ELO, does not appear. Buyer beware!!"
5,Las Vegas Season 2,"I searched for this item on Amazon, because it was pretty expensive at all the other major places you would go for DVD's Target, Best Buy etc. Some places didn't even really have the season, or had random people on the front that didn't fit with the first season. I was really pleased with the speed of the delivery and the product when it was delivered. It was nicely wrapped and packaged so it wouldn't be damaged. Thanks!"
4,Great Show But Different Music,"First thing, the DVD set does not have the Elvis music that opened the show when it aired in the US. That really takes me out of the feeling of the show to be honest with you. It's not a deal breaker, but it isn't good.The show focuses on a fictitious Las Vegas casino and the main characters are all employees. The biggest focus is on the security angle, but there are other angles to it as well such as problems with the entertainment, trying to keep high-stakes gamblers happy, etc. The show is fast paced and very well put together.If I had to pick out some things to complain about, at times they get a little too happy just showing this or that celebrity that I really couldn't care much less about. There are also a couple stinkers of episodes, but I mean with what 23 in a season that's bound to happen. I also think ""Big Ed"" is a bit old to be the physical tough guy they put him as in a few episodes.Even with minor nitpicks, the show is great and I'd highly recommend."
3,Not as good as it seems,"We purchased this product to help organize my son's Star Wars action figures. And for the most part it was good. But we had a hard time with the sizes of many of them, and the latches came off easily as they were hard to open. Also, not all the dividers stayed in place well and we had to glue them in."
5,Looks like it'll be dull--it's anything BUT!,"Where was this book when I was writing my first three novels? Halfway through this book, I threw out everything after chapter two of my current book (and I had 13 chapters already written!) and started rewriting feverishly. Powerful stuff. If you haven't read this book, you probably don't know enough about how to write captivating scenes and what to do with the characters AFTER the scene is over. I only put this book down long enough to apply what I was learning. It's worth every penny. A heartfelt wish Jack Bickham had written much, much more about the art of writing..."
3,narrow focus,"The book covers good topics, but only addresses communication in the workplace. It needs to cover personal communication skills too."
2,Erroneous Valuations.,"The monetary valuations of Salt & Pepper Shakers in this book are virtually useless to either a collector or seller. I have never seen a book so totally unresearched on both pricing and product description. The majority of the photos of the S&P's do not describe the material utilized in their construction, so one is left wondering if they are looking at plastic, metal or other material.No person interested in Salt & Pepper collecting should buy this as their first book. If you do, you'll be in for a big surprise when you try to buy an S&P that has been valued in this book for $12, but is belling for $48.For the more seasoned collector, it does have some decent pictures, but is more or less a rehash of better produced S&P Collecting books.If you've been collecting S&P's for over 6 months, you'll realize that this is a piece of utter tripe; execpt for the photos of the S&P's."
1,Not pleased,"This was the first book I bought on Salt and Pepper Shakers. I didn't find it helpful at all. Unless you just want a collection of S&P books, don't waste your money."
5,Pure Krall,"Unlike some of the other reviewers I loved the ""new"" sultry, Diana and her offerings. This, however, is probably much closer to the ""true"" Diana Krall than some of those offerings. Unlike the current crop of rap ""stars"" (making millions with their celebration of poverty), artists like Diana Krall,Jane Monheit, Tierney Sutton and Cheryl Bentyne actually KNOW the music - both theory and performance.Krall, in addition to being a fine pianist and a top-of-the-line vocalist is also actively involved in arrangment and composition (as are the others mentioned above). This performance is one of the best, carrying that atmosphere and sense of presence that only a live outing can do. Once again, the melding of her voice and piano with the band says it all- arrangements are crips and never ""wandering"", her rather odd intonation is near perfect.The album improves on repeated listenings as all good recordings do."
5,Very Enjoyable and that's all that matters...,For those reviewers trying to compare Diana Krall to people like Sarah Vaughn... forget it!!! She's not Vladamir Horowitz or the Pope either!!! To give her a low rating based on that is absurd.This is a very very good Jazz band and Diana Krall swings. She plays well and she does an incredible amount with the voice that the maker gave here. The album is very enjoyable to me and it's a good place to start if you want to hear Diana Krall.Is she great? That question is so subjective and who cares anyway. One reviewer suggested that calling her great was disrespectful to the great Jazz singers. Popular singers like Diana bring attention to Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn and Sinatra etc... People start with Diana and move backward from there... 5 stars from this reviewer!!!
5,Really good...,"This album really flows and swings. Very enjoyable. I am not thrilled about the last two songs. The Billy Joel song is OK. Not sure about the other one. Still, the live songs are just great. I heard this CD before any of her other CDs. I really like this one better than the studio CDs - not to say that the studio ones are in any way bad. This one is just really good."
3,DIANA KRALL LIVE IN PARIS,"I GENERALLY DO NOT LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES,, IT SEEMS TO TAKE AWAY THE REAL SOUNDS.."
5,Diana in Rare Form,"This is a very great record that demonstrates Diana's vocal prowess and clearly demonstrates she's more than just a pretty face. Her performance of ""The Look of Love"" really does stand out. She also shows that she can improvise with the best of them. Can't get enough of this CD."
3,Different views of jazz,"Bought this because I was buy up cd in this genere. A little up beat for my taste but still good. Her skill is obvious, I dont know if the songs and voice is exactly what I expected. I would accept this gladly as a gift."
3,Should have been cross-referenced,I'm glad that someone tried to do a thorough burial of the Bible the ultimate work of fraud and deception. I wish Graham had cross-referenced Mises of Syria. I've been looking high and low for this figure and can't find him anywhere. Anyone can help me on this one? A web-site or book besides Graham's.
4,A courageous exposure of biblical mythology,"Graham does a fine job here of indicating how the bible is really not so unique as many people--Christian or otherwise--might believe. Virtually all bible stories, from Noah's flood to Christ's resurrection, have antecedents in the mythology of ""pagan"" peoples. While these similar myths don't prove that the stories in the bible are not historical, we should ask why a universal, omnipotent god--bent on providing us with salvation--would allow his son to preach doctrines so much like those of his contemporaries and forbears. Can't god differentiate his product from the offerings from other religions?In any event, Graham exposes biblical mythology in his ""Deceptions and Myths of the Bible"" in a manner that is at least entertaining and at most eye-opening."
4,Know your Mythology!,"Though this book offers no reference to the author or a bibliography. If you are a student of mythology you will see where he stands. The truth is sometimes hard to swallow. Exspecially if your life has been controled by Fear and Guilt. The bible offers to many contridictions, and its history, for the most part is incorrect. Now if you were to gather most of his footnotes you could make a bibliography of your own. Or if you are not a lazy couch potatoe, you can read the other myths, some that were written 100 to 1000 or more years before the bible to see the correlation. The bible was written by the had of man, with greed and focus on the material world. Once Humans make the decision to Love, we can end this 2000 year old hypocrisy."
1,Don't bother,"This book is poorly written, poorly argued, and poorly documented. It would serve the author well to consider the following statement: Assertion has no truth value. He asserts his points with poor backing."
3,Where did he get the information,"I wish he cross-referenced this stuff. I'm trying to find out about Mises of Syria and can't find any records anywhere about this alleged person, as opposed to Sargon of Akkadia."
4,He's dreamy,A wonderful CD with some of his old classics and a few I've never heard before. Brook Benton makes each song his own.
4,"If the production was just a wee bit better, it would get 5 stars","Pros: Amazing songs, amazing band, FANATICAL crowd, and everyone is in top form.Cons: The mix/production is a little bass heavy and missing a little high end at times.Overall: I have purchased this cd twice! It was stolen from me once, and it was quickly replaced. ""Darkside of Aquarius"" is pure metal."
1,wrong boot,"This ball joint is the right part number..But the boot seal that came with it is too small..Can't force it past a certain point, won't seal all the way down..Would not buy again.."
3,"Funny and engaging, if not Woody's best","This comedy caper is by no means among Woody Allen's best, nor the most consistently funny, but it nevertheless entertains. Allen and Ullmann manage to make the central characters warm enough to engage our affections.Often it is said that Woody cannot do physical comedy, but there are some delightfully amusing moments herein that belie such a criticism, such as Woody's bungled attempts to sneak upstairs at a party to commit a robbery without being noticed."
3,Woody Lite,"Small Time Crooks is Woody Lite, well worth a three star rating. It is a fun little movie with some very engaging actors including Tracy Ullman and Hugh Grant. This is good fun, if not memorable. It hearkens back to the older Woody movies that are fun for the sake of being fun."
3,Sweet but no as sweet as cookies !,It was good but I have seen better actors better cartoons and also I have seen Woody Allen act better . I LIKED IT BUT NOT MAJOR. SO I GUESS I LIKED IT SO-SO.
2,Small Time Results !,"Even the genius of Woody Allen couldn't save this weak story and even weaker cast. Anyone who has the slighest dislike for Hugh Grant will hate him at the end of this film in which he play his usual whining pompas Englishman. Just when this film is starting to find it's feet it has a stupid twist that would work if it was the slighest bit funny - it's not. In all, Woody is just some amazingly talented and his body old work is great enough to let this one die a quiet death. My advice, wait until this DVD is reduced in price or buy it at auction so you won't feel like you've done your money !"
2,This has to be Woody's worst effort,"As a big Allen fan, I expected the usual amount of laughs...about 1-2 every 5 minutes. This movie provided maybe 3 laughs from start to finish. This is my first review ever in Amazon, but the film was bad enough to compel me to post this to prevent anyone to spend money on this. Rent it only if you are really compulsive to see every Woody Allen movie. Very slow and predictable. You were warned."
4,Excellent story telling,"Everything was engrossing about this British story with lots of suspense where it was impossible to guess the next scene. Thomas Hardy deserves the credit for this captivating tale. The cast and filming were excellent in the best British tradition. Only criticism was that sometimes the English/Scottish accents interfered with following the story, hence only the 4 star rating. This was definitely not a low cost production as often experienced with American TV. I thank Amazon for making this available since missing it years ago on Masterpiece Theater. Also a good buy considering the length of the production."
2,So-so,"This book is full of motivational speeches and brand promotions, but light on actual training advice. As a former competitive swimmer, I noticed that some of the advice in that area was actually wrong, so I started wondering whether biking and running sections have errors too."
3,Triathlon Training,Arrived in promised condition. Not crazy about the book - the exercises and guidelines are helpful but Mr. Harr's writing style is too reminiscent of a high school gym coach.
2,Not very verosimile.,"It is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by Roger Moore' performance. Her's good for a dandy, in the continent, but in this film he is not convincing at all. He is verry debonnaire, like he is just sipping tea in Great Britain.Thus, the film becomes stiff and you don't believe it. The other actors simply try to do something, like a farce. It is a pity to see the great Richard Burton in such role.Eugenia Lizalde"
4,"Longish, but great fun and action packed...","Just curious, though, how you release a 30th anniversary edition of a 1978 motion picture in 2005. Must have missed that math class..."
1,Family Love,"With all respect to Sir Roger Moore, wich i feel a profund admiration, i have to say that this film was not what i was expecting.Like a mother who always find nice everything that her childs could do."
3,Dick A,This was a book with a frightful prediction. What happened in the 15th and 16th centuries could be expected to happen in the 22nd century. Evangelicism could take over and a new pogram will happen. Allerts your scenses to a real but underground world about you.
1,I do not recommend this.,New HeadBlade Sport -The Ultimate Head Shaving Razor!I did not find this item easy to use and it did not properly shave my head even as I replaced the blades. I tried holding it from several angles and moving it different ways across my head. Nothing worked. It got a few spots and left others with stubble or longer.I ended up discarding it and going back to my Trac II razor.
2,Ouch!,"I've been using a Turbo Mach 3 for years, and came across this... Being careful to follow the directions, I never could get a really good shave without repeated and repeated passes. It did work well to remove a chunk of skin a couple of times, though. In the end, I'm back on the Turbo... If you're thinking of buying one, I'll sell you mine!"
1,Worse than the original.,"I've used the original headblade for years (once a month)and I've been very happy with it. The stupid wheels on the tail end of this ""improved"" model reduce your directional control and, because of the vibration they produce, reduce the sensitivity you get from having the tips of your finger guiding the blade. You end up having to run the blade over several times to get it completely clean.With the original model, I rarely cut myself. I cut myself twice with this version. I tossed it in the trash halfway through the shave.They should fire the product engineers that decided it would be a good idea to make this thing. ""I know, people will buy it if it reminds them of a sports car."" Is that really true? I hope not."
2,"Trying something different is okay, but...","Trying something different is ok, but what happens if the old stuff is better, simply that? ""Melissa"" & ""DOn't Break the Oath"" is Mercyful Fate. Now, without Michael Denner, Timi Grabber and Kim Ruzz, it Bris a band which lives sorely upon Hank Shermann's virtuosity in the guitar. And returning to satanic lyrics is something so stupid to do that's hard to understand why the band (or King Diamond) choosed to do so!!"
2,"""9"" Doesn't Compare With ""Oath"" or ""Abigail""---Sorry!","Wow! Another Mercyful Fate album! Cool! I put it on! Hmm! Pretty good songs. Lyrics and vocals . . . the same as ever. One problem. Something's missing and I can't put my finger on it! Maybe it's the lack of Michael Denner? Maybe not! I'd like to say I think this is great, but I can't. On the other hand it doesn't TOTALLY bite. Sorry, but this one can not be comparred to ""Don't Break The Oath"" or ""Abigail."" (If you are out to buy your first Mercyful Fate or Diamond album, I'd start with one of those and skip this one.)"
5,Stuck in the 80s?,"Any so called MF fan that says this CD sucks is just stuck in the 80s. This is a GREAT metal album. And for newer fans like myself who aren't as into the falsetto singing, this record has the perfect balance."
3,Of course it's not Mellisa or Oath. That was almost 30 years ago.,"I've been a KD/MF fan for 20 years. I buy anything these guys do because I owe it to them for all the pleasure I've gotten from their work since my high school days. ""9"" isn't a strong release. I actually like In the Shadows and Time. And King's last few solo albums were weak. But, still, these boys haven't let up for over 20 years. I'm just thankful for any effort they put forth at this point, and have no problem shelling out less than the cost of a 12-pack of crappy beer to hear some new songs about Satan and baby's blood. Let's all remember, KD has got to be over 50 by now. Thanks, King!"
2,This is NOT the MERCYFUL FATE fans know and (used to) love!,"A very disappointing album in my opinion. This band has little in common with the original band. That's my first complaint. My second complaint is that the lyrics and songs are really lame. It doesn't totally blow chunks---there are worse albums. But, is far as MF is concerned, I can't think of one that is worse!! (Maybe ""Dead Again?!"")"
5,A much needed book,"This is an excellent book. As a storyteller I know the impact that stories can have on kids, and this book fills a need that many storytellers have for a thoughtful discussion of stories that teach moral principles. As a parent, I know the importance of a moral education for our children, and this book provides an example for any parent on how to use stories to discuss moral issues. The Norfolks provide stories that can be used in a character education program or read or told to your own child, an account of their experiences in using these stories in character education programs, and a discussion of storytelling's role in character education. Definitely worth buying!"
5,Outstanding!,"This book completes Catton's trilogy on the Army Of The Potomac. Catton covers the army from late 1863 to Lee's final surrender in April of 1865. Like his other two books, Catton is full of information and the book it quite entertaining to read as Catton's style is descriptive, but gets to the point. Catton covers the introduction of Grant and how the army changes command structure and the pursuit of Lee is pressed. Battle coverage of the Wilderness Campaign, Spottsylvania, and Petersburg was very interesting. Catton's political coverage of the Lincoln administration helped bolster the book to add further insight. I had wished Catton had covered more of the Cold Harbor battle although his coverage of Sheridan's Cavalry operations was fantastic. Anyone looking to understand the Army Of The Potomac owes itself to read this book! 5 STARS!"
2,No Life,"1987's Life is the worst album in the vast Neil Young catalog. Despite being reunited with Crazy Horse for the first time since 1979's brilliant Rust Never Sleeps, Life is a real bust. The sound is bogged down by weird effects and overall, most of the sounds are simply bad. ""Inca Queen"" might well be the worst thing he has ever done. ""Prisoners Of Rock & Roll"" and ""Midnight Vacation"" save Life from being totally without merit."
4,The shocking Miss Pilgrim,I enjoyed having a woman's perspective on the early Hollywood Era but found the writing style a bit dry. Still a worthwhile read.
2,Expensive and they clog,"I've used the brown unbleached filters before which worked better. These fit well but I've had a problem with them becoming clogged in the bottom of the filter and not letting the coffee drain into the pot. It sits there like a little coffee pond. The repetitive clogging at the bottom makes for a much stronger pot of coffee than I usually prefer. It's also a pain trying to fumble with the filter to get the water to drain out. Tried different grinding and coffee, but get the same results. I didn't have this problem with the equally expensive brown natural paper filters."
5,Just great!,My son who received these filters say they are perfect and help make the best coffee ever. Thanks so much for making them.
5,Smoothest Coffee Ever,Over the years I have had just about every coffee maker there is. Until now the brew I made was great. That was until I found the Chemex coffee maker. Now I can't be satisfied by any other method. I'm addicted there I said it. Those filters do such a great job of making a delectible nectar of roaster heaven that I can't stop making coffee.
4,Subtle delight,"This album's dreamlike flow is probably not going to win any instant converts, but give it a chance and it will insinuate itself into your psyche, and you will find yourself taking delight in its many subtle charms. Similar in feel to some of Lucinda Williams' later albums, it is more poppy, less bluesy. It is also more experimental, but not overtly so: The way a high-top is suggested in the drum rolls in ""The Circus Song"", the cool -- as in a wisp of peppermint -- guitar break in ""Without You"", the bodhran opening of ""Reel Me In"". There are layers and details here that will reward repeated listenings with increasing appreciation for what Richey and her producer, Bill Bottrell, have crafted."
3,where is the real kim richey ?,"i know that the real kim richey is being held hostage somewhere and this imposter is being allowed to release music using kim's name - first album was jangly country sort of - second album was a little more introspective even a little bit melancholy - third album was, what i thought would be her turning point heading back towards her first album - now with rise she goes further down into the pit of self-exploration and leaves behind the catchy choruses and heart-felt verses we were so used to - i saw her open up for trisha yearwood without a band & she played so well - her voice was angelic and she even played severeal new songs which i havent seen appear on this new album - she must have scrapped what she had to that point and started off in a new direction - i can only hope she heads back to the place her first & sceond albums came from or i might not be buying the follow up to rise....."
2,Hi.,"my name is Kim Richey and I want to be just like Morcheeba. Nevermind that I used to be a cross-over country/pop artist, I think I'm going to venture into trip-hop now."
5,A Really Cool Record By A Really Cool Chick,"This is another work that is praised by people with taste and panned by people who never learned to spell.If you know which is your group, you'll know whether to buy it.As Kim once told me, the baby is a little bigger."
2,RISE ACTUALLY FALLS,"Being a major fan of Kim Richey and of all her previous three releases KIM RICHEY, BITTERSWEET and GLIMMER respectively, I could not wait for her new release. What a massive dissapointment. I agree with one review that said NO JUDGES is the only standout track on the cd. I agree completely!!! The rest of the album almost put me to sleep......I was planning my grocery list, etc while listening to it..usually she captivates me, this cd is junk....her voice is incredible but the songs are sorry to say, trash.....Bill Bottrell did a huge disservice to her....I hope next time Kim goes back to doing it all on her own! That is where she ""RISES"".....better luck next time!"
1,One of the most boring CD's I've ever heard,"How could Kim Richey have a recording contract? This is the most boring CD I've ever heard.Each song sounds the same, which is hard do to when the music changes.It does have one use other then as a coaster. If you put it on before you go to sleep. It's an excellent sleeping pill."
2,"Not standardized, and Amazon is sending out used items","I tried to use this to replace a Schlage deadbolt since Kwikset is a name I know and this particular item was much cheaper than any Schlage product. However, it did not fit since the locking mechanism was longer than the Schlage. I did not have any tools to drill into the door and therefore I was out of luck. I ended up buying a Schlage deadbolt from a hardware store and paid three times the cost of this.To top it all off, Amazon sent me a USED product with scratches all over the deadbolt from apparently being locked and unlocked hundreds of times. At least someone got some use out of it."
3,Ok. Could have been built better,"The size seems right. I like the small space divided.However, some dividers sit loose- I think it they could have been fit tighter."
2,Neil Young's Eddy Arnold album,"During this period of time, Young went through a febrile episode of trying to be all things to all people. Such as a 'Fifties rocker (""Everybody's Rockin"") and a Kraftwerk clone (""Trans""). What I'm hearing in this album reminds me of a number of Eddy Arnold singles my father owned when I was a kid. Young even brings in a fairly faithful imitation of Hugo Winterhalter's orchestra as it backed Arnold on Dad's old 45's. This is most noticeable in ""Wayward Wind"". There's only one problem. If you've already excelled in two other styles--the pre-grunge of the Crazy Horse albums and the mellow but pointed commentatator/ folkie--taking on other styles might not necessarily be such a good idea. Versatility from Neil Young when we're expecting him to sound like Neil (not Eddy, Buddy or Ralf und Florian)is a mixed blessing at best."
1,his third worst,"Dissapointing. Young can play just about any genre well and country is no exception. The reason is: you believe him. He's not faking it. On Old Ways, he sounds like he's faking it. He sings these cover songs like he's at a kareoke. Worst of all, he sings with a twang that is equal parts irritating and laughable. Maybe that was his point--showing the world he didn't care. This album does kind of come across as an inside joke. Buy this album only if you're a Young completist. Otherwise, stay away. Trust me."
4,Old Ways,"Neil always sings songs about love and friends. This is a nice easy country album. Relaxing and truthful. I am a 62 year old woman who has followed Neil since day one. I like Neil so much that I recently bought myself a guitar, mandolin, harmonica and a clavinova (electric, acoustic, computerized piano) and am learning how to play his music. I love it all. Rock 'n' Roll Gramma!"
3,Good for price (economical) but flimsy (you get what you pay for),"Personally, all I needed was something to store my heels and flats and this worked just fine. If you're planning to hang anything bigger than an average woman's shoe (eg., tennis shoes) then this isn't the product for you. Although I was worried upon reading other reviews that the shoe rack broke within the first day/week or so, I think mine will hold up given the light load. Overall, I'm satisfied."
1,Falls apart - save your money,Easily assembles & easily falls apart. Does not last. Rack attaching to door hooks always falls off.Making entire rack fall down. This and shoes falling down = danger for little ones. Do not buy!!!
3,Nice background music (and Track Listing),"This selection of Christmas songs done with a twist of jazz is fun and adds a nice backdrop to any Christmas season.Amazon doesn't seem to have a track listing... so here it is for your pleasure. Please note many of the songs have vocals but some of the tracks are instrumentals only.1. We Wish You A Merry Christmas*2. Santa Baby3. Merry Christmas, Baby4. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen5. Silent Night*6. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas7. Cool Yule8. Away in a Manger*9. The First Noel10. O Little Town of Bethlehem**indicates instrumental only."
5,"Tight lyrics, interesting production",This album was one of the rawest I've heard in years. The production was astounding. Check out their other album South Central Thynk Tank!
2,Overhyped,"Abstract Rude has certainly gotten better... the lyrics and production on this album are awful. If you want to hear him at his best try, say, Codename Scorpian (w/ Moka Only & Prevail) or Who Framed the A-Team? (w/ Aceyalone). The only saving grace of this album is the ""Inside your Eyes"" which is powerful and moving..."
4,Hot Cd,"Judith after her first Hottest Band In Town release,obviously enjoyed that so she decided to do another one.This is also very good and her voice sparkles here.This is a style she felt comfortable with and you can tell that by listening to it.Her voice fits into this style perfectly.Its interesting music,but i must say its not usually my style.I was just curious to hear some of her solo releases after she left The Seekers.It amazes me that her music here is far different to what was on the charts at the time.Proves that she wanted to do music that she liked.Its a very good recording and worth getting."
4,Ugg Ascot review,I've purchased Uggs before but I got these as a gift for myself. They fit great and are of much better quality than other slippers that I've purchased.
5,I'll always have a pair...,"I'm late coming to the Uggs party, but I'm a loyal customer now. I presently have three pair of Uggs. They're fantastic, especially if you're looking for comfortable, stylish footwear that's consistent with the minimal/barefoot philosophy that says you need to wear shoes that let your feet do their own work.Fabulous quality. And if you've never had your bare feet wrapped in shearling, you're missing out.I agree with those who say that the men's Uggs tend to run small in the slippers and large in the boots. Keep that in mind if you're a half-sizer like me trying to get a proper fit in a shoe that doesn't come in half-sizes. (I'm normally an 11.5, but wear a 12 in Uggs slippers and an 11 in Uggs boots.)"
1,UGG Australia (china) Men's Ascot Slippers,"You can't even get sheepskin from Australia, what kind of world are we living in. I am trying so hard to spend lots of money online....at Amazon. But everything is from china, and the reviews show quality is bad and prices full retail."
5,"Cozy comfort, warmth and practical","Ordered these for my husband for Christmas. Don't think he has taken them off since. The fit was accurate to his size (14), and comfort great. I especially like the sturdy sole as he likes to wear his slippers out on our patio or out to get the mail and the concrete has been rough on other slippers he has previously worn. Both he and I are pleased with the slippers and the delivery was as promised."
5,"cozy, cozy, cozy","I bought these for my spouse for xmas this year. We are keeping the house colder to reduce heating costs ... this was just the ticket for keeping toes warm and snuggly! I was thrilled with the price, the quality of the produce, and the speed of delivery; my spouse was thrilled with the comfort, the fit, and the warmth!! Thanks!"
5,best slippers!,I bought this slippers for my son and He just loved it! He wants to wear it all the time!good buy!
1,My Dad Like Them,I bought these for my Dad and he seems to enjoy them. It's difficult to determine if he's just saying that or if he really does though.
5,"Best slipper, and UGG sells the sheepskin insole separately","This is the third winter with my UGG. I've been wearing it only inside our home. It's really comfortable and warm and everything, as other reviewers already wrote.It's also nice to know that, if the sheepskin insole wears out, I can buy a genuine replacement from UGG.Apparently UGG thinks of its own products as something that should last some time, not some throw-away-in-a-year-or-two type stuff. That means something to me."
5,Great!,"My husband had been having a lot of trouble with his feet hurting. I bought these for him for Christmas and he has loved them. I bought a nine which was too small so I had to send them back and get a 10. He said he doesn't like to walk in the house without them now and his feet have not been hurting, YAY!"
3,The slipper size is inconsistent with normal shoe size,"I bought these slippers for my husband who has a shoe size of 11. The size 11 slippers do not fit him, he could not even get the bridge of his foot in. They do not have larger size, so I ended up returning them. We were disappointed, because they look so comfortable and we were looking forward to them."
5,Outstanding Product,"Perfect and cannot wait to give them to my son for Christmas...They came just as ordered..It is such a wonderful andpleasurable experience when a company gives you a great product and great service.I will definitely purchase another pairagain,,,hank You"
2,Altama Jungle Boot,"Boots are ok, I am very hard on boots. and the front of the sole is easily worn and will begin to peel off the boot with everyday use. not impressed with the size 13s i recently bought."
4,A different and authentic perspective,"I picked up this book at a used book store not really knowing anything about Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I loved this book. It was an interesting point of view, one I truly enjoyed, perhaps more than if it had been from EBB herself. The book is long but did not seem it; it did slow down just a tad in the end, but I have nothing but good things to say about this book. The author really captured the language of the time and it was excellently written. If you like historical fiction, I highly recommend this one."
2,Lady's maid needs a dr phil wakeup,"Dr. Phil is right in that you teach people how to treat you, and that is the lesson this ""lady's maid"" needs to learn. She spends the whole book letting her famous employer deprive her of a human existence (the dog has a better life), whining all the while but rarely taking the necessary steps to ensure a life of her own. Or even believing that she deserves a life of her own. She's mostly content (whatever her whining) to bask in vicariously living through what crumbs her employer throws her. I lost patience with her very quickly. What little she learns is mostly too little and too late. As for those who say ""this is how life was for maids -- sure, for some. But they aren't the ones worth a novel. I can't recommend this book at all. I do recommend ""Not in front of the servants"" which is a fascinating description of true life tales ""in service"" that doesn't involve hair shirt flagellation."
3,Text too small,I have to use magnifying glass. The content is great since it's one of the all time great works on the subject of Christian contentment.
4,good for what it is,"I actually own the original release of this album, so I am not aware of any remastering that Jack Dangers may have done. Now, this is the first release from Meat Beat, however, it is not a true album. What happened was there was a fire in their studio and they had lost everything that they recorded. They still had a deadline to make so what they did was take four of their best songs and basically did a remix album with them. This is a good album for what they had to work with. This definitly shows the raw talent they have. Meat Beat is one of my favorite industrial groups because of their innovation and fusion of musical genres. This is a great start for those who are interested in getting into MBM or for those who are interested in where they started."
2,Inaccurate,"The packaging was cheap like other people said, but even though the box was smashed up, I got it in one piece and it worked. The only problem is that it's off by about 6"" in 20'. That's piss-poor accuracy, and I have to use a correction factor to get ballpark numbers. Spend the extra money on a better product."
2,Worked for about a week then stop!!!,"Poor product, the meter stop working after first week, then the handle just broke. very poor product, very poor..."
5,Awaken to Superconsciousness,"This book offers a thoughtful, creative, and practical approach to meditation as a practice and as a way of life. Obviously based on wisdom of a high order and drawn from a distant past, it is at the same time relevant, intelligent, well written, and even humorous. It is very inspiring and shows the writer, Walters, to be a person of sensitivity and realized wisdom."
5,"Lights, Camera, Sex",This was an excellent autobiography. I am waiting for her second book.The pictures were a nice addition.
3,"""Theres a lot of dead tape on that one."" quoth my mother-in-law","And she was right about that one, that's for sure. This release by Australian comedian Billy Birmingham (aka The 12th Man) is a reimagining of the This Is Your Life format of show, and is actually an enactment of what such a show would be like if it was based around Australian sportsman and TV commentator Bill Lawry.The format allows Birmingham to introduce many of the same characters he has entertained the Australian public with for years and his ability to mimic voices and inflections of these well known Australian identities is quite uncanny. However the humour just isn't there on this one, the idea was OK, but the execution is quite lacklustre. It is, at once, both boring and unfunny in sections. And it faded from the charts but fast.Not to mention that this release would be totally lost on non Australian audiences. And again, it's The 12th Man so you probably don't want to play it in front of your grandmother."
1,Good for a while....but....,I thought I had gone to wine bottle opening heaven using this gadget. It opened bottles with very little effort for several months. But then it slipped the gear and is completely unusable. This time I'm going to pay a little extra to get quality and a warranty.
5,This band keeps getting better and better.....,"I love this new album. I've been waiting for a truly hardcore album to come out, and now here it is. And the best thing about it, the lyrics aren't crap. Thats the hardest thing for me is too find hardcore bands that have good lyrcis instead of hate filled poison your soul lyrics. This album is freaken awesome. For Christians and nonChristians a like. If you've heard this is a Christian band, don't pass this album buy just because of that. Or there older albums either. Their lyrics don't force you to see them as a Christian band, but just as a band that speaks from their hearts. This band brings a new dimension in hardcore music. They also bring something far more important, truth about this world we dwell in. Check it out, you won't be dissappointed."
5,Nice selection,"Weitzer's collection spans a wide range of issues from the need to do more research in this area, to legal debates, to international support services. Contributors include Wendy Chapkis and Jacqueline Lewis. Weitzer is careful to include a variety of perspectives concerning sex work, from those who celebrate paid sexuality to those who believe receiving money is recognition of being someone else's property. He also has a nice list of recommended readings, although it's only two pages."
1,Wrong book sent.,I order this book it was said to be a Chilton's it was Hayes. And to top it off it was for a truck
4,An exciting experience if you can tolerate the sonics,"I can't imagine that radio engineers could have botched the sound this badly--it fades in and out drastically, which is more irritating than the prevailing fuzziness and lack of solid highs and lows. So this must have been a radio broadcast taped by an innept amateur. Even so, the solo voices are caught better than the orchestra and chorus. If you can tolerate that aspect, the rest of the performance delivers an exciting night at the 1966 Salzburg Festival.As the other reviewers have noted, Ghiaurov is in splendid voice and uses it to great dramatic effect. The rest of the casting is first-rate for a live performance. In the pit Karajan conducts with his usual mastery, and the vienna Phil.--what you can hear of it--plays wonderfully. Altogether, if you pretend that you are listening over the radio to a vivid live event, the results are very satisfying."
1,Be careful,"The music is predictably gorgeous, but the quality of recording is very poor. The sound fades in and out as the characters move around the stage, and is fuzzy in the extreme registers. Don't think you are getting a bargain."
2,Easily Neil's least essential album,"This is perhaps the only neil young album I can think that I can honestly say you shouldn't bother with. It's still neil, so its not all bad (the stand out track , hippie dream, is excellent), but the overwhelming majority of these songs just flat don't work. The biggest thing this album has going for it is its low price. Since its so cheap, its almost worth picking up just to satisfy your curiousity. Just don't expect it to be a constant fixture in your daily listening. If you want to check out neil's experimental period, you're much better off checking out trans..."
2,Neil Didn't Even Try On this Album,"With the wealth of talent Mr. Young has it is disapointing to see it wasted here. Can this be real? That's what I thought when I first listened to it. I thought maybe this could be a ""golden Turkey"". It was not. It was a poor,poor effort. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because this album finishes my Neil Young collection. I only with this album would have had something feesible to it. But it lacks."
2,Press To Play,"It does not matter whether you use computers or synthesizers or not. It is the songs which should carry things. It this case, aside from a couple of exceptions, things just don't happen."
1,not impressed,"I was eager to try this cleanse as I did my research, and was impressed with the reviews provided by other users. However, after only two days of taking the supplements, I have had constant headaches. These are not due to the lack of caffeine as I do not drink this stimulant on a normal basis. I have changed my diet to help with the cleansing process, but haven't noticed too much of a difference. Also, the pills from the third phase must have some sort of sleeping aid in them as ten minutes after I took it, I could not keep my eyes open. This sounds good in theory, but the idea of putting something in my system that forces me to go to sleep makes me a little nervous. Anyway, maybe you'll have better luck with them than I did, as it seems other people have found them helpful."
4,"Good "" Don Carlo"" of the former years","Really enjoyed this performance of Don Carlo. I have many recordings of the work and I prefer the 5 act version in either Italian or French, but this performance with the usual presentation of that period is a great one for the voices represented. Christoff and Gobbi give outstanding performances and Stella give a very committed performance and she is in excellent voice. The orchestral sound is not what we are used to today, but the digital mastering does bring everything clearly into focus. The voices are never overwhelmed by the orchestra as is the tendency of many current recordings. My favorites are the Bergonzi, Tebaldi, Bumbry, with Solti at the helm and the French version under Abbado a close second. The Alagna in French under Pappano is also very interesting too."
5,The Best Yet,"This is the first book in a trilogy about the end times described in the bible. Having already read other end times fiction, I can recommend this series as the best out there.Unlike the more popular end times fictional series, these books were written for readers who want to think. Character development is three dimentional, rather than flat. Science is carefully joined with end times prophesy for a very chilling, but realistic feeling.If you are looking for ""cotton candy for the brain"", these books are not for you and I would point you towards the ""Left Behind Series."" If, however, you prefer fiction for the intelligent adult, then these books are just the thing for you.One tip...buy the second and third book in the series together with the first book. You will not want to have to wait for the remaining two books to arrive once you finish book one."
4,Very intriguing religious fiction,"I liked how the author used real biblical facts and combined them with a little sci fi. You can't stop with this one, you must read the entire series. It is worth it."
4,Defies convention,"All three of the Christ Clone trilogy books will peak your interest if you're into theology or science. The age old debate of religion vs. science is a hot one, and James BeauSeigneur does an excellent job of raising questions that interest many of us. Don't go into this expecting a typical view of the Bible and religion. If you keep an open mind and realize it's one man's interpretation and imagination, you'll find it an excellent read."
5,"well researched, high tension, extremely creative","James Beausigneur combined christian mythology about the apocalips with the best of espionage, thrillers and science fiction novels. He researched the basis (on for instance the shroud of Turin) very well, which makes the story even more believable. And he carefully unfolds the filosofical and political implications of the cloning of Jesus at the end of the 20th century. He has a good eye for the historical and biblical facts and the way the international powers of today work. It's a must read. Unputdownable!"
4,Great End Times Book,"This book is masterful. Having just finished the Left Behind series, this is a nice change on the same topic. It's a wonderful end times novel, based (in the first two chapters) on acutal facts. Beauseigneur intrigues readers with his very apt combination of science and religion. Although it gets a little tedioius in the exact description of happenings at the United Nations, this book will carry you through and leave you hungry for the next. I can't wait to receive the second installment."
1,"too short, soft metal, fragile finish","Although I was careful in my attempt to assemble the rack, the dark finish got scratched and the soft metal threads kept mis-threading and stripping. When I finally got the rack assembled (with only a few threads remaining to hold one of the pieces in place), I hung a bath towel on it and the ends of the towel rested on the floor. My towels are over-sized. Small bath towels would probably work. I returned the rack."
5,Amazingly beautiful,This is music at its best! Would recommend this to anyone who appreciates quality music. Loaded it to my computer so I can listen at work.
2,Dissapointed,"I saw some reviews about it, I read some info...But I am still dissapointed.When I tryed to open his legs, they broke. (they are not metal as shown on picture, they are made of some kind plactic)Two legs broke even without forceing it to open.Now I am using it as ordinar flashlight but still not as good as any other. Light flickers (2-3 times in 5 seconds) and has very short range.Next time I will buy Larget Stanley tripod. Hope theyr quality is better."
4,Stanley tripod flashlight-keychain,"Works as advertised, but pretty big for a key chain in my mind. Uses LED's. It is handy if you need a small light source pointed in one spot but nobody to hold it. I got it as a combo offer with it's larger version which I like alot. Would reccommend it you need a small light source."
1,Mini tripod flashlight poorly constructed,One legs fell off the mii tripod within the first hout I had it. This rendered the tripod function useless I should have returned it but that would cost too much. I would not buy product again
1,not as shown in picture,"The product i recieved is not the product shown in the picture and is a all plastic.I have the large version and like it so i ordered this one, but it is crap, fell apart in my hands right out of the package."
2,TOO SMALL,EXPECTED THE FLASH LIGHT TO BE BIGGER. DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU EXPECT ME TO WRITE 13 MORE WORDS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
2,Not what I was expecting.,"The flashlight is very cute, but when I tried to put it on all I got was a very very faint light. Turns out 2 out of the 3 batteries exploded and that's why the light wont work. Now, not only have I paid 6 dollars for this flashlight, I have to go to the store and buy new batteries. This is why I rated it so badly, I mean if you pay for something to come with batteries and ready to work it should be so."
3,inferior book binding,"I just received this book from the United Kingdom. I am now starting a class in Greek, so can`t consider returning it because it would have to be returned to paperbackshop.co.uk Ltd in the UK. The book binding is coming apart, as well as a shiny steak down the middleof the book cover. Very disappointed in the outer quality of the book!"
4,One of her best,This is in many ways a typical 'faith based' love story. A true believer falls in love with a non-believer and through many life tossed elements the non believer is converted. This is true of this book and many of the travails are unlikely but what makes this book is the nice way of the non believer despite a lack of 'true faith'. It has a connecting book A Strange Proposal that is IMO not quite as fun.
4,Investing is War,"The war analogy is excellent. To win the battle for investment profits you have to know yourself and know your enemy. This book shows you how the enemy thinks and moves. You can't take on the heavyweights on their turf, you have to pick your spots to attack."
5,I love this one!,I prefer this over the old 1970s Scooby Doo Mysteries! In this one the monsters are real and it's actually as silly as the Adams Family but silly in a good way! It's old school cartoons at their finest! The newer scooby doo series seems rather dull even with it's better animation!
4,Loved it!,"I have been anxiously awaiting this book because I LOVE this series...I will admit that it is not AS great as the preceding books but the book is still a great read! I raced through this book, laughing out loud and sometimes even crying. I too hope that Kinsella continues this series, just so I can see how Luke Becky and baby get along!! Love the author, love the books, love Becky!! Great buy"
2,Repetitive,I read all 4 of the Shopaholic books and they seem to just be very repetitive. You can basically predict after the first book what the main character will do. But I still got through them all and though they were cute.
4,A whole new shopping world for Becky,"Becky Brandon takes shopping to a whole new level in this book in which she shops for her unborn child. Her philosophy is that on one can ever have too many prams or too much baby equipment when preparing for the blessed event. Becky's husband Luke is excited about the baby too, but he is also very distracted with his business affairs. And speaking of affairs, Becky is quite convinced that Luke is having an affair with her obstetrician who just happens to be an old girlfriend of his. As usual, Becky's friends are very supportive of her, and her mother-in-law is insufferable. This book is light reading and has lots of laughs but it does show that despite her self-centeredness, Becky does have a maternal side."
4,Can you love the book but hates the heroine?,That's what append to me averytime a read something about Becky. I love the Shopaholic series but I really can not understand how can a man put up with her. :)
5,Shopoholic and Baby book review......P3 and R4,"I thought that this book, Shopoholic and Baby was a wonderful and extremely funny book. To read this book you probably should like romance novels. If you do not like teenage girl books you will most likely not enjoy this funny but romantic book. For me, this book had a great sense of humor. The story of this book is set in England. Instead of strollers the people from Britain call them prams. I thought that was unique since it is so different from the word ""stroller"". Over all (on a 1 to 10 scale) I'd give this book a 9.5. I loved it! Maddie"
3,Becky and a Baby?!,"Having just read ""Shopaholic and Sister"" before this and ""Mini shopaholic"" after, this book was probably my least favorite of the three. First off, I felt like Luke Brandon was not acting the way I had imagined him to be from reading the earlier books.In this book he seemed a weaker version of himself. But, I see how Kinsella has developed him from the earlier books--just not the way I imagined. I was disappointed in that I thought Kinsella could have done more with the idea that Becky was having a baby and been more creative with it...but I still enjoyed the book! The character of Vienna was described wonderfully! But, I was disappointed in the ending of what happens to her character. See what you all think and enjoy!"
5,Can't wait for the next one,"Good audiobook, love the accent. Becky didn't do as much shopping as she usually does, but she definitely got herself in the some tight situations. Can't wait for next one."
3,Least Favorite of the Series,"I love love love love love Becky Bloomwood Brandon. She is funny, stylish, whimsical, outrageous, caring, outgoing, and so many other things all in one little person. I have loved every single Shopaholic book, except this one. It was a decent book, but by comparison, I thought it was a little dull and flat. I also felt like Becky looked very foolish for the majority of the book and that Luke almost belittled her. I know they are supposed to be flawed characters, but it felt like a departure from who they had been in the previous books. Maybe I read too much into it all."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"After the boring ""Sister"" chapter of this series, I was hoping that Becky would get back to shopping like the maniac we all know and love! Alas, it was not meant to be. Instead she focuses too much attention on the ""other"" woman in this story and it fizzles out. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I came away feeling very disappointed."
4,much better than shopaholic and sister,"hey shopaholic fans! this book was fantastic, had me laughing outloud and i finished it in no time, didnt want it to end though. im looking forward to the next book!"
2,"I did not like any of the characters, which made me not like the book","Since I am pregnant and I have to take a lot of bed rest, I was hoping to read something fun. I forgot to read any of the reviews before I bought Shopaholic and Baby.I like shopping and playfulness but I also like adults communicating as grown-ups with their partners. I like to read about honest relationships and I guess, the ""games people play"" bore me.The main character, Becky was super selfish and immature. And everyone else played along with her shallowness. It made her adventures sad, not fun nor funny.I would not recommend this for readers, who would like a bit of cheering up."
4,A Fun Finish!,"This was very cute - a nice finish to this fun series. It wasn't my favorite of the five, but it wasn't the worst either - strangely, I think it is the first one that I liked the least. Still, it's a fun series and reading it has been a great way to usher in spring! I will keep an eye out to see if Kinsella continues this charming series any further!"
3,It was only so-so.,"I really enjoyed the first two books of this series. But honestly, I think this storyline is tired. If you are looking for a quick fun read, you have found it. But don't start this book hoping for a deeper hidden meaning, because this series has officially reached its shallowest point."
1,Poor kindle version,"There are plenty of free electronic versions available of Typee. But I decided to buy this one anyway assuming that the time spent by the editors on the footnotes and on combining several editions of the work, would be worth the money. But to my disappointment, this Kindle edition is just a scanned version of the printed book with OCR software applied to it. The book is not divided into chapters, there is no link between the footnotes and their location in the text (I didn't manage to figure out what the numbers of the footnotes actually refer to) and there are frequent OCR errors. If you want to read Typee on your Kindle, there are probably better versions available than this one."
3,More local color than adventure...,"Yes, it was a fun read, and my rating reflects not whether Melville succeeded in what he was trying to do - rather, my rating is a reflection on my enjoyment level.The imagery is beautiful in this intensely pictorial novel. The scene where the narrator's Polynesian ""girlfriend"" acts as a sail during his canoeing jaunt in the lagoon is one of my favorite mental snapshots, not only from this novel, but from American Romantic literature as a whole.But, just when one is relaxing into the somnolent atmosphere, Melville gives us pages upon pages of breadfruit recipies as well as detailed descriptions on the manufacture of tappa. All very informative, and in keeping with Melville's intentions in writing this travel novel, but these passages turned me off a bit.His next novel, Omoo, is laugh aloud funny, and a superior adventure novel to Typee."
2,An unhappy blend of romance and history,"I opened The Ice Child expecting to read an historical novel, informed by the abiding mystery of the lost Franklin expedition. What I got was a warmed-over romance novel, ridden with cliches and purple prose, its characters about as convincing as pasteboard puppets. It's too bad, too, since the parts of the novel actually set during the 1840's when Franklin was underway are quite decent -- McGregor could have written a fairly compelling historical novel, but instead has produced a mashed-up mini-series. Readers looking for a fully mature historical fiction drawing upon these themes would do much better to pick up Andrea Barrett's Voyage of the Narwhal, now in paperback."
2,Obsolete,"This is a civilian reprint of the 1983 ST31-91B. The issue version with it's waterproof pages is a collectors item and not worth much else. Both versions are now very outdated in much of their treatment and management of illness/injury. Frankly when I first got the book in 1983, I didn't find it's sparse outline presentation of information very useful. You can find more current information, better presented in some of the newer books on Wilderness Medicine"
5,His spirit lives on in the music...,"SDQ 98 has become my favorite album associated with the late and truly great Doug Sahm. My discovery of Doug Sahm's music went backwards from the Texas Tornados to his earlier solo and Sir Douglas Quintet work. SDQ 98 has the best of the Doug Sahm sound. Blended genres--rock, blues, country, tex-mex--it is all here in some of the most melodious work Sir Doug has ever done. Joined on this one by his long time collaborator Augie Meyers, his son Shawn and alternative country pioneers the Gourds, the songs on this album will make you appreciate what a talent we lost when this music legend left us. His spirit, however, will live on in great recordings like this one. If you were ever a fan of Doug Sahm, the Sir Douglas Quintet, or the Texas Tornados, you must have this album."
4,CLASSIC INDUSTRIAL GEM,"I had only heard ""Now is the time"" (which isn't on this cd) before buying this one, so I was taking a chance....And I scored tuff! This is a great cd, especially if you like early WaxTrax stuff."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"I ordered a CD titled Maximum BBC, sight unseen, prior to its release date, and got sent this piece of [garbage] instead. There is no music by the band on this album; instead, it's an audio bio narrated by some obnoxious British woman telling you a story that you already know by heart, full of the writer's opinions and negative, sarcastic remarks about the U.S., all to the tune of the same boring repetitive backing music that was obviously created on a synthesizer workstation and is quite tedious to listen to. The only Who material present consists of some excerpts from old interviews that are poorly reproduced and hence barely intelligible. I'd give it a zero if I could."
3,Larger than life hero battles men and monsters,Good read for young and pre-teens. Larger than life hero battles men and monsters to win the woman of his dreams. Far from one of ERB's best works but this one does avoid the the outdated racial and class sterotypes of his more extensive and popular Tarzan and Princess of Mars series'.
2,Dollar Store Quality,"Okay for a kid. Nice pattern but the camoflague pattern sells at the dollar store. It's ok looking, just cheap quality.Not horrible, but not great."
3,Mixed,"The first tape was broke,so I actually didn't get to listen to the tapes, but the seller has said he would refund the money."
1,what a helpless and hopeless movie,"VERY artificial emotions. you see poor Sandra crying and pretending to be sad, and it doesn't move you one little bit. Even Gena Rowland wasn't acting like she usually does. It's not worth watching it. keeps draaagggging on..."
2,WEAK,"The story really dragged. I kept waiting for the plot to develop but, much to my dismay, it didn't. I really expected more out of Bullock. I found watching grass grow to be more interesting."
3,A second chance at love.,"Hope Floats is a slick and soapy romantic drama. Sandra Bullock is great in this film but I just could never get into this film. Directed by Forest Whitaker, Hope Floats is about a wife and mother who decides to go back home again after she finds out her husband is cheating on her. Gena Rowlands and Harry Connick Jr. also star. I like Bullock's vulnerable but assertive performance, she is so under-rated. Hope Floats sank for me, but you if you like chick flicks then give this one a try."
2,This movie just does nothing.,"Maybe I expected way too much from this movie. I loved the previews, the actors, the music. Then when I rented the movie I was totally disappointed. This movie is just ""there"". Nothing special. I wanted to laugh, I wanted to cry, I wanted to feel something for the characters. Nothing about this movie touches you anywhere."
3,Not a bad movie!,"If you're at home on a lazy Saturday and need something to watch, put in this movie. While the actors do not command an Oscar performance it was a good story with a good ending. This was the first movie I saw with Sandra Bullock and I've been a fan ever sense."
1,Different Zone Coding a problem,"I did wonder if we'd be able to play and view these two DVDs, which we sure wanted to have for ourselves.But being in a different Zone Code in Australia, we are having a problem viewing them!!!We had no problem, with all of those ""Deadliest Catch"" series, so expected the some run with these!!!!But that wasn't to be, obviously!!!!We may have to look at buying another DVD Player, that will accept your different Zone code!!!!So there you have it!!!!! But your service, was ""next to none"" and we won't hesitate to acquire your services along the way, but will need to be more careful, of what DVDs we order, in the future!!!!!We could be interested in the ""Ice Truckers"" series, but it depends on the Zone coding!!!Your sincerely, Louis Jones..............."
5,Tear Jerker,Enjoyed this movie. Didn't know what I wanted to watch and like Sandra Bullock so choose on a whim. Wasn't disappointed.
1,One of the worst movies,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sandra Bullock plays a clueless, unintelligent woman. Harry Connick Jr. plays a hick. The dialogue is terrible. The daughter character is one of the least likeable in movie history. Skip this!"
3,OK but could have been better,"Sandra Bullock is in this movie which automatically makes it worth watching. I guess the thing that bugs me is that nobody wants to let ""Birdie"" (Sandra's character) and her daughter heal on their own and find her place as a single mother. Her mother immediately pushes ""Justin"" (Harry Connick's character) on Birdie, and does so relentlessly throughout the movie, despite Birdie's reluctance. Justin comes off as a too-persistent cornball. At one point in the movie, Birdie's mother even chastises Birdie for not snatching Justin while she can, saying that she only has so many ""chances"". I found that pretty pathetic. Of course it had a happy ending which is good, but I just think they should have let Birdie be Birdie!"
5,"sexy, emotional, love story","Connick was very sexy here. handsome too. the story was slow, but i guarantee you, you'll fall in love with it. i cried somewhere in the middle. love me too, Connick."
3,Good filter when modified,"Bought 2 of these filters about 4 years ago. Lid is poorly made and difficult to replace. Carbon filter pads cloged quickly and were discarded after first use. White pads lasted for one season and fell apart after repeated cleaning. Replaced pads with other media-a/c filter and 1"" thick foam padding. Placed bag filled with lava rock over the filter. This increased filter capacity and extended cleaning period for pads. Recently replaced lava rock bag with with 2' x 1' pad of green Matala filter material. I discarded the lid as it wouldn't fit. Filter works great for small pond or quarantine tank.This filter is somewhat expensive for a plastic box with some pads."
3,It was good enough for any Laurie King fan,"Even though the first book of the serie was absolutely the best of the lot, finding the fourth one was a thrill as I am sure it was for any Laurie King fan. It was a bit tedious and it seemed to me the story would not start quickly enough but it still proved interesting enough for me to recommend it."
3,Another Error If you have 1st Edition,To help those still using the first edition like myself there is another error on page 513. They have b as the answer and it should be a.
2,Basic Watercolor Techniques DVD,"While there are some good tips on this DVD the overall quality is rather poor and the run time is fairly short. I think a better choice for the beginner watercolorist is Julie Cohn's The Dance of Watercolor - Beginners and Beyond. She gives detailed information on the use of water, paint & color. And her DVD is even less expensive than the Basic Watercolor Techniques!Do yourself a favor and order Julie's instead."
1,DOA: dead on arrival,"I don't know whether the batteries were dead or the flashlight itself was defective but the unit was dead as a doornail right after being taken out of the package.I have sent it back to Amazon, and I hope I get a refund."
3,Not Durable and Too High Priced,"While I loved the features and brightness this light lasted only about 10 months for me. For the $15 price I expect more. Keychain flashlights are wonderfully convenient. As an alternative, I recommend such simpler, less costly ($8 to $9) and more durable lights as theGarrity LED Key Chain Liteand theGerber 0-4 Highbeam, Silver, Light White Bulb, 22-80023."
3,The red is a little strange,"Everyone should know, this is RED. The light is RED. I didn't actually realize that when I bought it. It's actually not bad to use. It's easy on the eyes and if you're just using it to poke around a bag or to try to light your way to a bathroom at night, it definitely does the trick. Also, it's really small so great for light packing."
1,Do not buy at this Price,I love sonos but this listing appears to be for the ZP80 - an older sonos model and originally sold for $350. The newer and smaller ZP90 is $350 and the newer ZP120 with integrated amplifier is $500. Go elsewhere to get this awesome piece of kit.
5,"Oxford edition has wonderful notes, and is great to read","It seems to me it is more helpful to rate and review the edition than the play itself, and this edition is superb. Along with the other Oxford Shakespeare books, this one has outstanding notes that are presented in such a way as to be easy to glance at while reading without breaking rhythm too much. I have found that each time I think to myself, ""I don't quite understand,"" there is a note on point that sets me back on the right track. There are also high-quality but very accessible essays and background information provided after the text of the play.Every time I'm going to read a Shakespearean play, I look for a version in this series; it is certainly worth a couple extra dollars or the frustration of reading from different page numbers than classmates if you are reading for a class."
3,"Good ""crankin'"" album","The bonus cut is ""Texas Blues"" from the 1972 Mar y Sol festival in Puerto Rico (which I also believe featured Cactus). The guitar solo is incredible, bringing to mind Grand Funk at their noisiest, most repetitive and overblown, and best.However, the ratio of mellower to rockier is higher than on the first Nitzinger album. If there had been more songs on this album like its best (""Eartheater,"" a real high energy wind-up tune), this would easily have been one of the top 5 hard rock albums from 1973.The band is great though, and John Nitzinger was (and perhaps still is) a great rock and blues songwriter."
1,Arizona Raiders,"This is the worst western i have ever seen.I have been to high school plays with better acting.In the first five minutes you see a cavalry unit ride in flying a 1960's infantey guidon. I can't believe they paid the actors in this movie,I was embarrased for the the cast.After the first 20 minutes i had to turn it off."
1,Me estafaron,"Le compre 2 unidades, de las cuales me llego una pieza dañada y la otra pieza no llego, me enviaron un tubo de aluminio, le envie un correo y no me han respondido, no recomiendo que compre a amazon.com tengan cuidado."
5,CYBERAKTIF IS A MASTERPIECE!!!,"What do you get if you blend Front Line Assembly's ""Caustic Grip"" and Skinny Puppy's ""Cleanse. Fold and Manipulate"" (minus Ogre's roars and snarls!)? A DAMN GOOD ALBUM. Each and every song has it's own special sound and this is truly one of the best in the ""industrial"" albums category. This is a must have for both fans of FLA and SP. Songs that really speaks are ""Nothing Stays"", ""House of Pain"", ""Road Kill"", ""Paradiessiets"" (my favourite track!). Check it out!!!"
3,Just OK,"When I was in the later stages of my ""Skinny Puppy"" phase, I started buying all the side project CD's I could find. Most of them are just OK, including this one. I still love ""Nothing Stays"", but the rest of the CD is just OK."
3,Nazi spy thriller,"This was MacInnes's first thriller (and first published novel as far as I know). It was written during WW2, but it is about a spy adventure the summer prior to the invasion of Poland. A husband and wife team get recruited to check out a spy chain that has become suspect. At first things seem to be going well, but then they get identified by the Nazis and must flee for their lives.Along the way they meet an American journalist and a British student, each of whom has their own reasons for wanting to strike a blow against the Nazis.Many of the elements used in the story are typical of MacInnes's later, more polished, work. However, the story is more of an action-thriller than the romantic character-based thriller novels that MacInnes eventually became so good at writing."
3,An Old Thriller,I think I would have given a higher rating in 1941 when it was written. I think that the intervening years has made me a bit more demanding of credulousness and good character development. Such weaknesses would have been forgiven--or unnoticed--as long as there was action. And there was action!
2,DX really should be x-ed for this!,"Typically offensive WWF ""sophisticated adult sports entertainment"" that McMAhon would defend. Mocks adults, authority, and any semblance of ""pro"" in wrestling that these atheletes could represent ... lousy immodest and arrogant characters. Partial matches - edited. Frustrating as usual. Indecent for kids. Offensive to traditional values. Photo quality was fine. That is all that was fine!"
5,One Word: Funny!!!,"This video is too damn funny! I got a sore side from it! Any DX fan will love it. If your looking for a match, though, you'll have to buy another tape. In my opinion it's still one of the best."
3,You've Heard This All Before,"If you have been reading books about spiritual life and transitions for some time, you will probably find that when you read this book that you have heard this all before. Arrien quotes the usual source materials from the bible to Native American sources. Although Arrien says the eight gates she talks about come from ""world tales"" and ""perennial wisdoms"" I felt she made them up in a kind of arbitrary way. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I could do without the little gnomes making comments at some of the thresholds and gates. The book's physical presentation is quite nice, with an attached satin bookmark and excellent photographs. There are questions and assignments at the end of each section for further contemplation. Perhaps because this book was pieced together from a Sounds True tape series it does not have the depth and continuity I would have hoped for."
5,Wonderful -- Just that little kick you need when you need it,"I love this beautiful little book. It gives me just enough of a start to a really good little prayer -- then I take it from there. Light-hearted, just pure and simply delightful, this book has given me both real joy and relief.Thank you!"
2,Not quite 2 stars,"This book did not hold my interest. The plot was thin and there was way too much thinking. I found myself skipping through pages and pages. While there was chemistry between the hero and heroine, the conflict was flimsy and they had almost no time together before deciding they were in love. They spent a total of two short meetings in his office and two days and a night together."
5,Commonsense,"I don't know how I auditioned before this book. For any high school or college student going through program or emphasis auditions, this book is essential. And even better, for professional auditions, this book is a handbook on how to do everything you will need to know.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to be enlightened."
3,decent flick,action move . Cage is ok. acting so so as you might expect from a Cage led cast.entertaining ....just not that memorable
3,FAR FETCHED,NICHOLAS CAGE SHOULD HANG IT UP HE LOOKS SO BAD .THE MOVIE WAS JUST TOOOO SILLY .TO BE BELIEVED PERIOD
4,Pretty good movie,it was interesting and kept you wondering what would happen next. I probably watch it again soon.I did think it would be a little better.
4,Have popcorn ready,"Pretty darn good. Some language a bit rough, but ok for most pg13 or older. Need to pay a bit of attention to the cast, as the movement is fast enough that you can get a bit confused. All in all, a good time to be had by all. If you don't use the pause button, you will miss a couple of quick quips."
2,As in my money was stolen.,How does Cage keep getting hired to make movies? For every good one there must be at least 5 or 6 stinkers.
3,Not bad,"not a bad movie, Nic doing what he does, has some decent twists, the desperation he exhibits drives the flick forward"
1,Only if you are REALLY bored!,"Rediculous plot, terrible script, predictable, unoriginal, zero sex appeal, a few sub par action scenes. It did hold my attention through to the end, but I still find myself very disappointed that I spent money to watch this."
5,Nicholas cage fan,What can I say. It's a good movie with an exciting plot but it really doesn't matter because Nicholas Cage can take a bad vehicle and turn it into great entertainment!
3,I've heard this `sound' way too many times before,"The Good""M367 (Out of Our Hands)"" employs an infectious repetitive riff and deep, soulful vocals to draw you in. If that riff doesn't get you jumping, then I don't know what will. ""After the Rain"" is a blend of clean arpeggios and driving distorted riffs. Vocalist Richi Uzzi's chorus section is both powerful and moving. ""Selfish and Cold"" starts of slow and mellow, but builds to a strong chorus. The riffage comes at you heavy and hard on ""Undone."" Revelation Theory closes up shop with the acoustic track ""Over the Line.""The BadThere's not a great deal of diversity from song to song. Plus, they sound a lot like Sevendust (and a few others) with less BOOM.The VerdictThe songs on Truth Is Currency are good, but I've heard this `sound' way too many times before. Revelation Theory may have a chance, but they really need to find their own sound, rather than follow their peers."
4,A nice train and railroad video,It makes a good video for me and my son to watch together. Good for people can't take a Rocky Mountaineer train in person right now.
5,da best,"It's the best jungle reggea compilation, worth the price for prizna and demolition man's Fire alone. The rest of the songs aren't as exciting but still make your head move. FAT JUNGLE CD"
3,"Fine book, poor format",I love this book. But I don't like the format this edition is printed in. Large and thin. Makes it feel almost like a kids' book.
4,Good story of hope and faith,"I was sent an advance copy of The Way Home, starring Dean Cain (remember Superman?) and Lori Beth Edgeman. It's based on a true story about a boy who goes missing and a town that rallies around the family to help.The movie is geared towards a Christian audience and tells the story of hope and faith in the midst of a tough struggle. I wish it could have been geared towards a broader audience and reach more people with a great message, however.Nonetheless, if you have a chance to check it out, there's a message about priorities and how a community should come together."
4,Good Movie,"Randy Simpkins is the man who has his priorities confused, work always ahead of family. This comes back to haunt him when he leaves his small son alone while he checks his email. His wife Christal, who I did not enjoy as a Christian wife and mother, is negative, and rude, always seeming very put upon. Once they realize that little Joe is missing, Randy panics, while Christal is annoyed. The whole town comes together in prayer and as if it was everyone's little boy gone missing.Heartwrenching to watch as a parent. Good reminder to keep God's gifts to us as a priority always."
5,The Most inspirational movie i have seen in a long time,"This movie starring Dean Cain is based on a true story. Its about a little boy who disappears near his families secluded home surrounded by forest. Randy, played by Dean Cain, is a father obsessed with work. His wife asks him to keep an eye on two year old Joe so she can get the bags for a much needed family vacation. When she comes out again Joe is missing. The community and surrounding counties come to search for the child.This movie touched me in so many ways. I laughed, I cried. I would recommend this movie to anyone but be warned dont watch this with out kleenex handy. It truly is an inspirational movie. This was well written and well filmed. And be sure to watch the epilogue while the credits are playing."
3,Typical Missing Child Movie,"Most of this movie was what I thought about with regards to a Christian based missing child movie. It didn't really have anything unexpected for me. I'm a mother and have even periodically misplaced my children or they wandered off and it's been scary. Glad I always quickly found them.The movie has a great message of faith, God, coming together, community, miracles. I guess I just expected those things and got them, which made the movie average for me. However, it's still a good movie and worth watching.-----------------------------------------Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

4,Great pick.,For some reason I tend to shred most regular picks very quickly. This pick with the nickel plating lasts a long time. Also gives a nice sound.
2,"the product came damaged, and the lid did not fit snuggly i had to return it","not very happy with the product, had to return itit was dammaged too, not likely to buy it again"
3,Its ok,"para el precio es bueno, el mismo color, la talla exacta, no muy buen material, excelente servicio, muy lindo diseño, por lo que para mi esta bueno"
3,red tolite monster,Its really funny and works but dosnt fit well on the tolite unless the tolites perfectly round. It also leves red marks on the tolite and the suction cups dont work to well
2,Hold up to One Pound - description wrong,"The descriptions for this item here on the page state anything from 8lbs to 1/2lb as the weight held by these suction cups. Ignore all that. The correct max weights are 1/2 lb for the small suction cups and 1 lb for the medium ones. There are no large suction cups included in this assortment, only small and medium."
5,Did the Trick,"I bought these to replace the suction cups from a radar detector windshield mount. The old ones just weren't doing the job anymore, and the radar detector company wanted way too much for theirs. So, I tried these little guys, and they work great!"
1,NO SUCTION!,ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION AND WILL NOT HOLD ANY LIGHT WEIGHT ITEM TO SECURE HARD TILE. DEFINITELY NOT A SATISFACTORY PRODUCT~!!!
3,Very small and do not hold that well,"People were right about the size - it is much smaller than the image would have you believe.I tried using it on the tile in the kitchen, it will fall off after a few days... Not the best product but it's OK..."
2,Review,I bought these last year to hang a few things in the shower. They were terrible. Even the cups with out anything on them would only stay up a few days.
2,very small,"these are disappointing. too small for what I needed.maybe i didnt read the description, but i put em in the trash."
3,Still have the scratched copy,"I still have the scratched cd from the box set like quite a few people here. Ended up buying a second, normal copy. Great music, poor packaging design whoever came up with that holder. Those aren't prints, just printed cards really."
2,Kick Ass In College,"I read Gunnar Fox's book from cover to cover when I got it. You'd think maybe I was starting collegenext year or something, when actually I've been out of school for decades. I just wish I had been able to havethis kind of advice years ago. Gunnar spoons out highly-educated tips in small, easy-to-take and understand doses.I will make certain my grandchildren read this before they leave for college. In addition to great advise for the collegebound, there are great life and career guidelines in this book as well.""PB, Roanoke, TX"
4,Nice!,"This book was really good! Gunnar's sense of humor and practical advice really made me think about college. If you know of some1 who needs some help in college, this would certainly make a great giftI only have 2 complaints that prevent this from being a five star book:1.While humorous, its a bit unstructured and its difficult to fully harness the advice. You really need it to settle in2.I dont like how Gunnar litters the pages with his seminar material. It just feels like a get-rich quick scheme.Overall, don't go on his website to order extra materials for college success. This book will suit most just finePersonally, I found two books to be more helpful: ""How to win at college"" and ""how to become a straight-a student"" both by Cal Newport. Just look at the near-unanimous five star reviews for both books!"
3,Warning CD-R format,This Diatonis DTS cd audio is on the CD-R format.To play it your DVD player or CD Player must supportCD-R.(Some Don't) You have been warned!
2,SPARKS LOWEST PEAK,"Though it is hard to give one of the greatest ignored bands a two-star rating...""Terminal Jive"" is probably one of Sparks' most unlistenable albums. ""When I'm With You"" is a good intro to the album...danceable, rhythmic, & romantic. But, the rest of the album sounds a like score for some made for T.V. soundtrack. It is not what's expected as a follow up for the ""No. 1 Song in Heaven,"" disco-rated Sparks, yet humorous & ball-sy. ""Rock-n-roll People in a Disco World"" reveals the album's theme, but album sounds flat overall. For Sparks fans...there's a few here you'll love & the album's worth purchasing. In fact, it's great to see the album availble in the U.S. for the first time ever! But for newcomers, this album is no go. Don't let this rating distract you from the #1 band in heaven! Sparks will have as big as a following as Led Zeppelin as soon as people stop listening with their eyes and start listening with their ears again!"
4,Atmospheric techno,"Beyond Thee Infinite Beat is an album of originals and dance remixes of tracks from Towards Thee Infinite Beat. The Dave Ball remix of Money For E is more spacey and the voice samples sound more eerie, whilst the Jack The Tab remix brings the Catalan vocals to the fore; this is my favorite of the three versions.The original version of S.M.I.L.E. is followed by the Greedy Beat Syndicate remix which includes the funny vocal sample ""just one hard boiled minute"" in the effusive instrumental blend. The original of Bliss is followed by the scintillating Andy Falconer remix and the atmospheric Short Sharp Taste of Mistress Mix.Horror House appears in two versions: the original and the remix by DJ Sugar Ray which sounds more techno than the first. The beautiful, evocative I.C. Water becomes primal and urgent in the Evil Eddie remix. The DJ Global remix of Stick Insect is another highlight of this album of atmospheric dance oriented music."
1,Pleasant,"""Cruel as the grave"" as well as ""the queen's man"" are mysteries you find the answer before the end of the book. They are easy and fast reading historical mysteries.I highly recommend Dorothy Dunnett, ""The house of Niccolo"" and then (not before) the ""Chronicle of Lymond"".Of course, one shall also read ""The name of the rose"" (Umberto Ecco)."
5,Let The Mixshow Begin!,"This is one of those types of CDs that is a must have for driving long distances. I say that because it will make the time do one of two things: stand still or fly by. In a word, this CD is - ""groovy"". From start to finish I always get lost in the groove. The track selection is great, and the transitions are flawless. There aren't any favorite tracks here for me, simply because they fit just nicely. This would make a great purchase...and pay no attention to the age of the CD. Some things are just timeless!"
3,Little to mellow for my tastes,"to many good vibes, I like a little hardcore in the mix , moving a little slow"
1,waste of time,"This movie got more confusing as it went on. The only reason we kept watching was the excellent cast, which was wasted on a rambling, pretentious, faux arty mess. Four simultaneous and overlapping plot lines with four families is an invitation to chaos, and they fully take that opportunity. Lots of intriguing possibilities but nothing really develops into coherence - reminiscent of Bergman's ""Scenes from a Marriage"" in its bleak, unrelenting despair. Like other reviewers have noted, the sudden happy sending seemed false and grafted on, suggesting that the movie makers had the same trouble we did in figuring out where all this was going."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND...",buy the book instead. The book is tremendous!! Well-written and engaging. The movie is a piece of garbage. It's agonizingly obvious the director had absolutely no idea what the hell she was doing. AM Homes should sue!
5,Great Condition!,I ordered this book for a Senior level Pediatrics course. It came to me in perfect condition! Very satisfied with this purchase!
5,A moment in time . . .,"MacInnes captures perfectly the atmosphere and energy of late 50s London. His writing has energy and wit. This book is more than fifty years old, but sounds more vibrant than then majority of contemporary writers. Don't be influenced by Julien Temple's lackluster movie. Check out the source."
1,Even worse than Race and Revolution,"For anyone interested in reading this book, or anything else by Gary B. Nash- please consider that these are the works of a revisionist, apologist, and anti-American ""historian"". I refuse to even sell back his books to my local used book store. They are simply placed in the garbage where they belong. There are so many fantastic historians out there. Don't waste your time, your money or pollute your mind."
4,three cheers for the eighties,with yeah the band perfectly combines the authentic wannadies-rochsound with the synthesizers which made the eighties. This light-hearted rocksong will brighten up your most miserable day.
1,To old,The figures and the forecasts are old and/or inaccurate. Some of the arguments are not logical and the grouping of countries and/or manufacturers is not comprehensible
3,Disappointing but I'm glad I read it!,"I found this book to be extremely readable and engaging but also frustrating and not quite believable. I was unsure where journalism was in evidence or memoir or just poetic license. The structure of the book was also confusing with several narratives and seemingly important events abandoned and never resolved. In the end, I found the book disappointing and rather simplistic. The title itself was also misleading as I thought the book would be about an individual who spent a year living with a community of nuns. Instead this was a frustrating combination of fiction, memory and (doctored?) interviews.Despite all that, I would have to admit: I'm glad I read the book. As a lapsed Catholic also searching for something greater than myself and our consumer culture, I identified with many of the author's feelings and was intrigued by the personal discussions of prayer, a calling and vocations, and the role of the church."
2,Misleading Title!,"I got this book because as a post-Vatican II Catholic, I wanted to know what type of life nuns had. I never went to Catholic school and my parish really never had any nuns present. To date, I still don't know! This title is very misleading. The author did not chronicle a year in the life; she took anecdotes from various nuns of their personal experience with their vocation. Also, one should be warned that the author is a lapsed Catholic with some bitter feelings toward the male hierarchy of the Catholic church that she has not resolved. Most of the anecdotes in this book are by women who left their orders because they were dissatisfied. Overall, the book was well-written and kept me very interested, but I believe the title is completely misleading and will cause more people to buy the book than normally would have, myself included."
4,7 page paperback !,"It seems a good book that so many people already bought, but it should not be a 7 page paperback. Can anyone tell more about it?"
3,"Cute outfit, too short",the outfit is really cute and everyone loves in on me but it is NOT long enough to be a dress. I have to wear khaki shorts under the dress because it's basically the length of a shirt.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL BEATLE FANS!!,The Fab Four is by far the best tribute band ever. They are all perfectionists in their portrayals and extremely talented. These Christmas CD's have some very clever arrangements and I think the Beatles themselves would be proud of the Fab Four's efforts. I purchased several CD sets last year for friends and family; they make great Christmas gifts.
1,"I'm totaly agreed with him ""Huuuuuuuuuge""","Please do not waste your money on this helmet, it sits high on your head and looks huge...the helmet too bulky...I'll add one more thing; (the size not fit me at all, its too big, I used to take XL from all other brand but not that one.RegardsGhassan"
1,Gave it away,"Caught too much air under the sides, putting strain on the strap, and therefore my neck.The strap is awkwardly positioned pretty far back on the helmet, making the strap ride on the throat instead of under the chin.Not comfortable at all, I gave mine to a buddy, who doesn't wear it either after the first ride with it on.Get a skull cap, these aren't good at all.They look goofy as well, due to the overhang of the sides. Makes the helmet look huge and your head look small. Pretty goofy."
2,German Half Helmet - Matt Black,"The helmet is really nice looking. The only problem is that no matter who we had try it on, it sits so high when worn that it looks totally goofy, so we are just going to put it on display and forget about wearing it. That is disappointing."
2,Runs SMALL,"I went on the sellers website and used their measuring chart which said I was a medium. However, when I received the helmet it was too small and sat way too high on my head. I plan to return the helmet and have since purchased one somewhere else, and I AM a size medium, I just think their sizes run small."
1,Spaceballs,Get this helmet if you want to look like lord helmet in spaceballs. NOT DOT APPROVED. Just a sticker.
1,not receve anything,l order 2 items l only receve 1 item l did send an e-mail to the company jafrum international and tell them my item code-115matt l did not get it but l receve my item code-sb1pu very fast l order on2007/07/03 they said that was ship on 7/3 and that take 7-21 days to get it but still did not get anything yet l like to solve this problem but jafrum do not cooperate with me this is my first time l order from amazon if l do not get this problem solve that will be the last time and l will go back to e-baythanks in advanceItem Code-115Matt :Matt Black DOT Approved German Style Motorcycle Helmet
3,I love the helmet but seeing someone crash made me rethink it.,"You can not beat the deal on this helmet, I got it for riding my ATV because I'm a more casual rider and I am no longer inclined to do things that will get me killed. It is very comfy, It's cool looking but the last time I went riding with my friend we were going down a hill that was not that steep at all and he rolled end over end with his ATV landing on his back and his rack smacking him in the head. He had a full faced helmet and it had seriously deep gashes in it when all was sead and done. He should not have survived the wreck and had he been wearing a helmet like this he wouldn't have. I wouldn't wear it on the street or on the trail after that."
1,Total Mushroom Head (Made in China),"From the reviews and description this seemed to be a different helmet form the ""Made in China"" one offered by most vendors. Do not be fooled. It is exactly the same and it gives you 100% mushroom look. Returned it."
2,Rage against the recycled,"I know that this is mearly a single containing a few songs, but I can definatly say that this is not rage against the machine's finest work. I only have one question. What happened to the days of the b-side? Many bands decide to contribute a rare song that would be somewhat new to a single. Instead Rage Against The Machine compiled a few live tracks and called it a day. When I bought this disc I really didn't expect much. I merely collect rage propaganda. I do appreciate their live sound, but I really do need something new and interesting to listen to because ""the battle of los angeles"" just wasn't all to great. So unless you're a die hard rage fan I wouldn't suggest this single, but if you are, good luck collecting all five versions of this single. You'd better stick to amazon.com if you want them all....."
4,Kudos to iBooks,"Poul Anderson has only been gone a few years, but already most of his extremely long list of novels and story collections is out of print. iBooks deserves praise for reviving one of Anderson's best characters, Captain Sir Dominic Flandry. Anderson was a pillar of science fiction from the late 1950s into the 1990s, and the Flandry books--part of the larger Technic future history that includes the van Rijn/Falkayn series--were from his strongest period.I read these stories as a kid and later as an adult and was impressed by how they grew with me--lots of bold adventure, but some serious musings, as well. Flandry is a very modern character, in some respects, with sophisticted tastes and inner conflicts, but also very much a man of his corrupt and decadent time.If iBooks perseveres with this series, then the best Flandry book--and one of Anderson's best--should be out soon, ""A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows."""
4,Just what my husband wanted!,My husband loves to graft his fruit trees and was so happy to get this as a present. He really liked the double blades. He looks forward to some successful grafts with this garden tool.
2,Not nearly as good as Seven Ways,"This is a decent cd, but it's not nearly as mature, listenable and fun as his later Seven Ways is. PVD's more recent stuff is really getting good and makes this one seem dull in comparison."
4,One of the Meistros of Electronica,"This CD is purely awesome! Paul van Dyk is definitly the godfather of producers. I am not a huge fan of non-mixed Dj CDs, but this is one exception! PVD, brought goosebumps to my body with ""For an Angel""! This song is deep, sufisticated, beautiful work. Trance has never seen a better man. If you are not a fan of Trance, PVD will change your opinion in no time! Get this CD."
4,Excellent album from beginning to end,"This intruigingly melodic journey through music exemplifies PvD's ability to mix in sensational DJing ability and his penchant for great track writing. It starts off very slow and dreamy, building its way up and down at a steady pace, the way DJs are supposed to. Often we'll find an artist seemingly assemble a CD randomly with their tracks, where a slow and sensual groove can become a banging wreck the very next moment. There are no such problems with this CD, featuring the infectious single ""For an Angel"", and also includes a more dance-oriented remix at the end of the disc.I refrained from giving this album the magical 5 star rating because it wasn't quite as good as ""Seven Ways"", which is a masterpiece among masterpieces in the electronic music genre."
5,Great Service,I was really pleased with this book. It was in excellent condition and arrived on time. It's great doing business with booksellers like this. Thank You!!!!!!!!!
5,Schooldays,Nicholas Nickleby was a distant memory from my own school days: what an unexpected pleasure it has been to 're-aquant myself with this book.
3,3 1/2. A good early effort,"The important thing is to know that this is earlier Dickens- thus, not as good as some of the masterpieces that came later. I enjoyed this at times and found the comedy exceptional. However, sometimes the novel veers into outright sentimentality. The hero and Kate are overly perfect. I am not saying anything other critcs of Dickens haven't already said. What makes this book supremely fun is the assemblage of characters and the ridiculous situations. Mrs. Nickleby made me laugh out loud. Read it and see the beginnings of Dickensian greatness."
4,"Small, nice quality",Perfect nightstand sized book. Love the convenience of not having a bulky book cluttering the area. Great nighttime read; would love to have the whole set.
5,The Teachings of Don Juan,great fiction or reality! spellbinding and captivating. Castaneda takes you away into a world of fantastic imagination.certainly worth reading again.
2,The journey begins--on the wrong foot.,"In this, the first and most uninspired of Castaneda's early books, he seeks a man who knows something about hallucinogenic plants. He finds don Juan, who indeed knows a lot about such plants, including the fact that they are (only) minor aids on the path to becoming a ""man of knowledge."" Unfortunately, Castenada doesn't figure this out, doesn't understand what is going on, and generally gets scared and confused by the mess he's gotten himself into.Readers are often encouraged to read Castenada's books in order, and that certainly makes sense, but this first one can (and should) be safely skipped."
3,NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY,"To fully understand,if possible,the teachings of Don Juan one must suspend all preconcieved notions of what is real.This is true,if you follow the readings,even if you believe this is a fictionalized account of many different conversations the author had with different people.The lessons taught still hold true in most cultures;that a well trained and disiplined mind will allow a person to see things others may not."
1,Worst PUA book ever!,"The title makes it seem like it was a condensed version of how Don Juan seduced bitches and a guide as to how the modern man could do it (minus the being dragged into Hell part).If there is a law against false advertising, this author and publisher should be thrown into prison."
4,Good book but the true author is an indigenous from Mexico (Puebla),"When I read this book in 1979 I found the 2 big parts in this book do not fit to one writer. Thinking, if it is meant to be that I find out about it - it will happen. Almost twenty years later, someone mentioned that a man whom I knew already would have written many books which are well-read in the world in many languages. These books would be published under the name Carlos Castaneda. Since that time I have a different connection to the man who is the true writer of the books. In case you are able to read Spanish and have a chance to travel to Mexico, here is the book's title written from the author about the situation he had with Castaneda: ""Cuando sea grande..."" Since this poor author had to do all himself, the book does not appear the way readers from North America are used to, but it is well worth to be read."
4,Modern Myth,Anyone who's familiar with the process of writing knows that Castaneda fabricated Don Juan. I'm not going to argue that was the reason why Castaneda shunned media since his thesis was based on a fictional and/or composite character named Don Juan. Nevertheless this book provides an important account of ancient trance rituals and drugs that enhance hallucination BUT it totally misses the point that one does not need magic mushrooms to be drunk spiritually. I recommend this book. It is far superior to Celestine Prophecy and most New Age books.
3,techneq for hair weiving,What is it actually mean.How it is look like.How long it is there.In future any problem occured or not?

4,Nice lounger.,"This is a very durable lounger for the pool. We purchased two of them and they are very comfortable. Only thing I wish is that they had a cup holder built in, but even so it's a great lounger for the price."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this ring based on reviews ...it was ok. Interesting though, I have received several compliments on it. The stone is certainly large enough; but I though the band was a bit on the chintzy side to support a stone this big. Certainly worth the money - as long as you have realistic expectations. You get what you pay for."
3,It's Okay,"I like the ring, but I am not 100% happy with the color. Blue Topaz is my birth stone and I LOVE the color online, nut it is much lighter in color in person."
5,Beautiful & an amazing deal!!,"I Purchased this ring as a birthday present for my mother, it's her birthstone.I was a little worried at first about buying jewelry online,but when I opened the package today I was sooo happy that I did!!! It is Beautiful and i just can't wait to give it to my mother!!!Bottom Line:Yes I would definitely recommend this!!!!"
3,South Park - Gift Pack 5 (Volumes 13-15),"This set was not what I expected. It was not the normal episode by episode that the other ""Gift Packs"" used. This was the ""Chef"" and ""Mr. Hanky"" tapes. The 3rd tape has ""Chinpoko Mon"" & ""Rainforest Schaminforest"". While all are good episodes, they are not in order of appearance on the TV series. Quite disappointing."
2,Cheaply Made,"I had a pair of these IZOD Chino pants that I bought in a department store about a year ago that were well made, using good, thick cotton material. I wanted another pair just like them and I couldn't find them in the store, so I found them on Amazon and ordered them. They are not making the pants with the same material, they are cheaply made out of some thin cotton material. I usually do pretty good ordering through Amazon, but this time I didn't."
5,Perfect for going to dinner,"I bought these pants for my husband. He says they're extremely comfortable, and they look great. They're a little casual for some office settings, but they're chinos--that's sort of what you'd expect. My husband has three pairs that he wears almost constantly."
4,"Long, but well written",I enjoyed the story and found myself staying up late into the night because I wanted to find out what happened next.
4,"Great music, terrible transfer.","There is absolutely nothing wrong with this music. It's great stuff. But I'm afraid Varese records did an awful job in the tranfer (in my copy, at least). The trumpet breaks up quite a bit on the first track, and there are some unlistenable parts where the sound distorts. Therefore, get this music - for it is magnificent - but get the more expensive Jazz World reissue instead. That'll save you some grief."
2,An Easter Surprise in My Basket,"My sister got this cd for me and put it in my Easter Basket. Is it too late to exchange it for some after-holiday halfprice Easter chocolate? Does Amazon even offer that? If not, for now, my copy is now listed over at Half dot com. I want my chocolate, even if the ear is broken off, it'll still be a better deal."
2,The Neverending Story,"This could be the sound track, being the never ending record that it is. It just keeps going and going and going. Does an Energizer Bunny proud. It's like a broken record, only after a while when it has nothing new to say, you sort of just tune it out. It also sounds like it lacks sincerity, it sort of sounds like it's trying to follow a formula, and as a result it's really predictable from one line to the next, so it comes off sounding a little shallow in quality.Once it was out of my cd player, i found it difficult to ever want to play it again at any point, because it's just long, you find you're just waiting for it to end after a while. It's sorta forgettable, like one of those cds you see a year from now in the cut-out bin at the record shop, and you see cover and vaguely remember it. The sound is just very generic at best."
2,like it,I like this product alot . They're not what I thouhgt they would be in the fit feel. But they are still what I liked
5,understandable highest level science with cultural backg,"The book covers a broad field - all parts in close connection with the others and its background in modern science and historic cultural connotations. The theoretical aspects are merged with lively explanations. Readable for the non-specialist, understandable for the average science-educated and meaningful for the specilaists, both in physical systems science and in philosophy. A top-notch guide through this topic of multidisciplinary novelties."
3,Full but turgid catalogue of complexity phenomena,This book is an extremely well-informed cataloguing of the many areas of human experience in which self-organisation and complexity phenomena play an important role. However the writer's style becomes very heavy as a result of transferring German constructions into English - so much so that I was forced to skim read many sections.
1,BUYER BEWARE: This Is Not What Is Seems,"This is NOT ""The Very Best Of Trini Lopez."" Rather, it's a collection of songs he recently re-recorded. The production quality is poor, he has minimal back-up, and his voice is, sadly, a minimal reflection of when he originally recorded these songs 30 or more years ago. Go with something else, and avoid this one."
1,don't buy this,"I bought 2 of these 1 for home and 1 for the office. I wish i could return them. this calculator doesn't work very well and I have made so many mistakes with thisI have lost confidence in their accuracy. Adding 16 numbers in a column on a tax form 6 times( you know add it then check it) I only got the same answer twice!!! and that turned out to be a wrong answer!!Division has similar fun results. I suspect the processors are faulty, And the battery is not replacable so it a throw-away!"
5,a must read,this book draws you in to making you believe that you are right there in the midst of everything. Malachi wrote this book as if he took everyone around him along during his journey.
4,1 dollar more may save you a lot of work,If you have an alternative buy an oil filter that has the nut built in.like the K series You wont need special tools and may avoid the terrifying prospect of crushing the old oil filter while trying to take it off. I did not give it stars because I did not research the cleaning capabilities.
5,Look At Mother Nature On The Run.....,"Harvest may have been bigger,but ATGR is a deeper ,more introspective album.Certainly inspired by his tenure in CSNY,their influence is as prevelent as his was on their Deja Vu album.Besides the classics(the title track,Southern Man,Don't Let It Bring You Down)there are acoustic nuggets(Birds,I Believe In You)that would've enhanced the somewhat schitzophrentic Harvest.For those who are only Harvest fans,give ATGR a listen and you'll feel you have stuck it rich."
1,Great album - Horrible mix,"I can sum it up in one sentence: The mix is so poor, you can barely hear the french horn solo in the title track! Find someone who has the original disc, burn it and listen to this wonderful gentle simple album."
5,A true heart of gold,"The great thing about Neil Young is that he continues to adapt his stype and try new things. Don't get me wrong, this is still clasic Neil Young; just Neil Young with a bit of a different twist like during the days of Crazyhorse. If you're a true Young fan you'll definitely come to appreciate the sounds of his acoustic on this album and that old twang in his voice."
2,Remastered Sound was a disappointment,"This has long been one of my favorite records and I was excited about the new master -- his recent Live at Canterbury House is pristine -- but I found the sound on this very muddled -- I thought my speakers (B&W; 703) were blown, or my Rotel 1069 pre amp -- but it sounds the same on another amp, in my car. The Loner sounds better though...As another reviewer said, I'm not sure you can tell much difference."
5,One of my favorites,"I have a longer review under the album ""Stolen & Contaminated Songs"". Obviously a lot of overlap between the two albums - I have always preferred Love's Secret Domain."
2,Spin & Marty,I only gave this 2 stars because I was incorrect in my thinking this was the original series. I bought it for my husband and he wasn't impressed with it. Had I looked closer at the description I would have realized it was a newer version of the old series. Just thought I'd write this review in case someone else was as quick to purchase.
4,Spin and Marty a pleasure to watch!,"It is a pleasure to watch this video; it had everything in it: action, comedy and tension. A realy family video"
3,A decent sequel to a true classic,"The best thing about HENRY 2 is that it keeps the same monotone pace as the original. Though slow, Henry 2 features some truly horrifying moments, and fans of ""Seinfeld"" will be thrilled to see ""Brody"" the bootlegger as the title character! A must see for fans of the original."
3,'High Jack - Politics Of Ecstacy' (Wax Trax Records),"This isn't an 'actual' six track mini CD or even a maxi-single as this Amazon posting implies. It's a various artist [actually a collection of Psychic TV aliases] - a six song indie release that (some of) us wasn't aware of. For the prices, it's okay - as I sort of liked the one Psychic TV song that does appear on this disc ""Tune In, Tune On"" and the Pearl Neckless track ""Rapid Bliss"". It's been a long time since I heard anything on the Wax Trax label. For the current asking price of $1.05 here - you can't go wrong."
3,They're all bad?,"Don't be mislead by the tag line, this film doesn't feature party all night college students (it's set in the fiftie's for one thing). Jamie Lunar goe's to college like her perfect sister before her so she won't be cut from her fathers will. Once there she falls for roommate Alyssa Milano's boyfriend Brian Bloom (Alyssa herself is on Jamie's blacklist for showing her up in class). Jaime then sets out to win Brian for herself, while making Alyssa's life a misery. This is a well acted film that fans of the actors will enjoy, everyone else should rent it first ."
3,A Good Soundtrack,"The only reason i'm writing this review is to ask, what's that music played during Roy's and his daughter's dance on the night club. I think it's an 80's music, but i can't remember the name of it. Well i dind't bought the soundtrack, so im not sure if it is on it. But for what i heard in hte movie, i'm sure i'm going to buy it."
4,Learning map & compass,Very good basic map & compass course. Formal training in the military gave me a good working knowledge and the confidence to use it. This book will help instill those same principles.
5,A fundamental source,"Used this book back in the Before Time, when we were first learning map & compass techniques. I regard it as a necessary first step in learning to use a compass productively. Haven't seen anything quite as good for learning the basics."
4,"Good coffee, but rinse them","I have had my Capresso coffeemaker for several years now and have used these filters from the beginning. One caveate with the fiters ... rinse them for a minute before installing them. You'll be surprised at how much ""charcoal dust"" comes out!"
4,Pretty Good,"This game has very cool graphics. it is fun to play, but can sometimes be boring. If your child does not like bowling, don't even make an attempt to buy this game. But, if they like or love bowling, try it out."
1,Was defective out of the box,"Upon opening, sharpener would not work at all. It comes with three AA batteries which is nice, but not if the batteries are corroded. Tried replacing corroded battery, but it still would not work. Returned product and will not replace."
4,"Few chapters are good, few are not about ISAPI","I used chapters 9-11, they are very good and useful. I think there are few more interesting things. I do not know why authors put a lot of info about IDC, ASP and other junk in the book about ISAPI. Also, I'm not happy with Delphi framework chapters ."
5,A Beautiful book for any reader,"This beautifully produced and elegantly written book taught me an enormous amount about a subject about which I knew little. While it is very intellegent and erudite, the author takes pains to make her fascinating subject matter accessible to non-academic readers as well.It is a wonderful investment and you should put it on the top of your gift-buying list for any friends, male or female, who are interested in art, in women's history, France, or just generally improving their knowledge. Every page is packed with a wealth of information, but the reading is exciting and stimulating and not weighted with pedantic language.The well-chosen portraits are illuminated by the text. This is one of the best book investments I have ever made. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to all readers."
2,Why is there only one F@&!$n' song?,"I am trying to find a specific CD, and I can't do that when I am told that there is only one song on the CD. If, however, there really is only one song, then I apologize. If not, I would like to be informed of the other songs, or why there is only one. There is also another one with untitled songs also by Ice T. THANK YOU"
5,One of Joel McCrea's better pics,"Joel McCrea still doesn't receive the credit he is due as an actor. BORDER RIVER is one of his better Westerns, with solid direction, good acting, and a good plot. The VHS copy is fine, and let's hope it will find its way onto DVD."
5,WOW,"These guys never seem to amaze me. I bought their first album because it was suggested by the salesman who is a DJ and music afficionado like myself. I asked him, ""what is good, chill, and ....,"" before I could finish he gave me the CD and told me to buy it no questions asked. I haven't looked back since. Now with Gran Riserva, words can't express the feelings and visualizations one gets while listening. Just like the title says. Like an expensive liquor only a chosen few get to truly experience. Where those who don't understand the love put into such a bottle or Album would quickly dismiss it as electronica or someother misnomer. This is art at its best."
2,Undeserving of it's reputation,"The album seems to be on a lot of ""must have"" lists in the ambient genre but it fails to live up to it's own reputation. The music soundscapes are dated and incohesive. KLF does not stay on target and they're all over the place as if they couldn't decide on the concept for Chill Out, if it was ambient or techno. Poor choice of dialog and audio samples makes it at times irritating, and an excessive amount of country influence used which takes away from the electronic space ambient feel. Some of the sound design is good but for the most part it's uninspiring and plays out as a demo CD. For ambent techno music of this style I'd refer to The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld for a better starting point."
5,One of a kind,"I wasnt much into Ambient....until i heard this little gem from the KLF.As one reviewer said it best, you can't put into words the experience of listening to this CD.Do yourself a favor : switch off the lights, take a portable CD player, a nice hot coffee, open a window, lie down on the bed, and listen..."
5,Really good,"I really like the product, and it got here really fast too, thanks for everything.I would definitely recomend it"
4,Satisfied,"I was quite satisfied with this product. The box was a bit bent but that's ok because that was mentioned in the description of the product and most other Majora's Mask games that were listed didn't even come in the original box. I was also happy to see that it came with the game guide booklet and my boyfriend (it was his Christmas present) was even more happy to see that it had some codes already writen in the back. (: So, I'm a happy customer. Thank you!"
2,SUKS,"I dun know, maybe this game is good, i just dont like b-ball games idn but this game is easy. Its not challenging, its just like... you know how basketball games are. Maybe it is good... the part about the bling...i dun know decide for yourself. To me its bad cuz its easy. A real good game is Def Jam Fight For NY now thats a real good game."
4,C-R-A-Z-Y,This is by far the best game ever. The moves the dunks the bling bling the off the hook cars and the ladies the awsome cribs . Beats any basketball game on the shelve this game deserves 13 stars
