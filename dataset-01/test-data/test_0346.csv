4,Length misrepresented,"I saw this live when I was a teenager. Two of my idols - I couldn't be happier when I saw this release. It is a wonderful memory of the two royal ladies of musical theatre and I am happy to have that. My quibble is that this DVD is listed as 120 min. The actual material, including credits is short of 30. This is vast misrepresentation. I mean, I knew they didn't perform for 2 hours, but list it in the description as such instead of the actual performances' length, and the DVD itself states a 27 min. length. I'm sure those of us who bought this would still have bought it at any price. I just feel cheated by Amazon's description. Shame on you, Amazon."
3,It's rather short.,It's rahter short. I was hoping it would be longer because I have another Dr. Seuss board book that is longer (Dr. Seuss' ABC's)and my baby enjoys the rhthym of the language in that book. He likes the fish that slide on this one and he asks for me to read it but it doesn't seem long enough then he moves on to other books. I
5,One of the essential film noirs,"The Blue Dahlia is a quintessential film noir, one of the great films that defined the genre. Army men return from World War II to find their wives drunk and cheating with scumbag jazz club owners. Whether this film has not been released on DVD in the U.S. is quite curious, considering almost every film noir has been burned onto DVD in various collections of the genre. My guess is that Turner owns the film, and hopes to air it only on TCM, or the potentially racist comment in the film has people worried. There were racists in the 1940s, and denying it by not releasing a film is pretty silly."
4,Another blast from the past,Wonder What happened to this group Yes it was rock and keybords and kinda simple only had on hit but was a goood one
5,What a great blast from the past,"I enjoyed seeing this album again on cdnow. I went to school with the lead singer "" Ric Jacobs "", at the time his name was Dick. He was my best friend in those days and we used to sing folk songs in his basement in Downers Grove, Ill. Buy this and you will not be disappointed. BTW, i saw the band 4 times. They were the intro band for Hall and Oates, the did 50 shows for them and what a party it was. Thanks Ric, and thanks to the band for the memories !"
3,An album lost in the 80's...3 1/2 stars,"Remember the video to ""You Don't Love Me Anymore""? One of the guitarists featured a mohawk haircut. Boy, are those days history. Dreamin' is Easy was a cool song too. I just recently purchased this cd for nostalgia reasons, but in listening to it I had forgotten just how good some of the songs were and how great some of the guitar playing was."
1,Domestic violence is not acceptable.,"This book started out improbable then went from bad to worse.The heroine's father is verbally and emotionally abusive but she feels she must tolerate it as she loves him and is sure he loves her -which he doesnt.Hence, she gives up the man she loves TWICE for her father who treats her as worse than a slave!Not acceptable!No-one should be feel guilt tripped into tolerating in a situation of domestic violence and his book deserves one star due to its promoting this very mistaken view."
2,"Great, except for the MAJOR PLOT WEAKNESS","Let me give you an overview of why I threw this book againstthe wall (other than the overuse of pet names and directaddress and, oh, lots of other things). Take a man, assumablydistinguished looking. Blue eyes, thick hair, bod todie for. Stick an eyepatch on him, and go to bed with him.Go to bed with him a lot. Okay, now let's have him a yearlater without the eyepatch. My gosh! It must be anentirely different person! Uh...no. I think the authormust have horrendous vision and/or perception problems if shethinks this can play."
1,Was wrong S0uthern Comfort,Was not what I wanted. I could not watch it because it contained things I do not believe in. Yuck
3,Early days,"This is a compilation of early Queen, Larry Lurex (a nom de plume for Freddie), and Smile, precursor to Queen. This is obviously a 1995 bootleg imported from Italy, but the laws there were more lenient on this kind of release (I also have a gray market Genesis pirate from there) before the EU came into play. The Lurex tracks are slowed down (an official solo Mercury box set corrected that). ""Mad the Swine"" fades in, unlike the legal 1991 B-side release. ""Earth"" was redone by Tim Staffell on his recent solo album, ""Amigo"", with Brian May guesting. Smile seem to dominate this album. At first, I assumed this was a normal album, but I had a lot to learn. This is really for experienced fans. Now I have a tribute show to get to."
3,"Good, but not all that I had hoped for.","I had high expectations for this CD, but it wasn't all that I had hoped for. It does, however, grow on me each time I listen to it. My favorite song on this CD is definitely ""Exercises In Free Love"". It is the operatic sound that I love to hear from Freddie. ""The Great Pretender"": It is not the Platters, but it is good. ""Time"" and ""In My Defence"" are the type of songs I normally associate with Freddie. I love to hear him sing slow songs. His voice is absolutely beautiful. The other songs are disco. They are upbeat and fun, but I think Freddie can put his voice to better use. If you love to hear Freddie sing, try ""Made In Heaven"". It is really good QUEEN in general."
3,If anyone should mess with these songs it should be Queen!,"This album was a tremendous disappointment to me. I was extremely glad that I hadn't passed up an old copy of ""Mr. Bad Guy"" to buy it. I do enjoy the title track, Time and In My Defense, but the rest of it sounds like over-produced house music. For better versions of songs from ""Mr. Bad Guy"" see Queen's ""Made in Heaven"" album. The ironic thing is in the liner notes for ""Mr. Bad Guy"" Freddie thanks Brian, Roger and John for not interfering. If only the would have interfered with this album. Remember: IT'S NOT FREDDIE'S FAULT!"
5,Very effective product,"I removed a number of decorative stripes on my van and was left with a stubborn adhesive residue that wouldn't come off easily with alcohol, turps or solvents. This product did it in a matter of minutes - you spray it on (it gels and doesn't run off) and then scrape it off with a plastic scraper. Everything came off immediately with no damage to the paintwork. Amazing product and well worth the money. Just note that one can doesn't get you far - I removed two 2"" wide stripes around the car and one can only did one side!"
2,Another Overrated Product By 3M,"I bought 2 cans each of both this and the 3M Woodgrain and Stripe Remover to use to remove the woodgrain from a late 1970s station wagon. Despite the highly toxic smell, neither product worked well and performed far worse than aircraft stripper I bought at the local auto parts chain store. Despite following the directions explicitly this product actually removed very little of the adhesive. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,"Cute doll, horse has issues.","The doll is adorable- purple in her hair, a darling 'princess' dress, pretty face. BUT - the horse has some problems, the doll can not stay on the doll unless you hold it on, and the wings do not stay on- and the horse is not too cute imo. My daughter rarely plays with the horse due to the fact that this pegasus can't fly because of his 'broken' wings. If you get it on sale buy it, otherwise get a My Little Pony!"
1,A misleading set,"This set comes with two of the most commonly known and respected tarot decks: Crowley and Waite. However, they are printed on mediocre stock and are quite small. This can be useful for an on the go, not easily missed deck should the cards be damaged but it also makes the symbolism of the cards themselves difficult to appreciate. The backs of the cards are also a disappointment, made easy to tell if a face down card is reversed or not. This destroys the sense of overall discovery when one has some idea of what to expect on that alone.Additionally, the book is highly misleading. This oversimplifies Tarot and gives horrible advice- such as ignoring reversed cards. Susan Levitt may have meant well, but her advice runs completely counter to trying to learn to truly use the cards.Final advice: save your money. For what this will cost you, you can buy two full sized decks- one waite, one crowley- and get a more sensible book in the little pamphlet types they put in for basic divination."
4,German classics put to metal,"Well, I don't know if these are actually classic German tunes or not, but they are sure fun! Makes you feel like you're part of a crowd with steins overflowing and everybody singing along. Tom's voice is in great form and you can tell he really enjoys singing these songs."
1,Not a very good product.,"Got one for one of my toilet tank, I needed to bent it in order to make it working on mine. It's not strong enough, the handle is almost fall off after several uses."
3,Little trouble with the recipes,My Croatian husband has a little trouble getting these recipes to come out right and he is an excellent cook. Some of the ingredients are difficult to find where we live (in the States) and sometimes the instructions are unclear. He made that rum cake recipe and it just tasted like pure rum. The cake was beautiful but tasted awful. The recipe for the crepes is delicious though!
4,Useful but be careful,"This is a savior if you have Plasma/LCD and a projector at the same place and you want one source to get displayed on to two places, but be careful if you have two displays that are not of the same quality i.e. high standard projector that can display 1080/24P and TV that can handle 1080i only, the display get forced to the lower resolution. You can get higher resolution but it is not easy and it is annoying process."
3,"'Modified to fit your screen.""",How could MGM release a fullscreen only version of a film at this late date? I'm afraid that this lovely film is too obscure ever to be re-issued in the correct aspect ratio. I hope I'm proved wrong.
2,Very Disappointing,"Have been looking all over to find a decent cd with more than 10 songs on it & then imagine my surprise when i found this cd & the price starts out at $33 & change. I like Sylvia & was looking forward to getting this cd until i saw the price, NO cd is worth that kind of money when it's barely alittle over 10 yrs old. Sorry guys NO SALE from me....."
3,"Eh, its ok...","Giving it 3 is alittle bit of a gift... I am a complete tech geek and like this laptop because its affordable,and it can do all the basic things i can throw at it. I mostly use this computer for internet and mp3 management. Point is, buy this computer if you dont use a laptop for much or want a simple affordable laptop to just layback and skim through your fave website or jam to some tunes. And thats why tech tv gives this a 3... out of 5. lol"
1,too much crashs with web-oriented applications,"It has a good speed in terms of price, but it is not reliable system and just too much crashes...and display(it is bright but not clear) isn't so good compared to other brands..."
3,"NICE LOOKS , BUT get extended warranty","This laptop looks very nice, but has a clumsy feel to it.It worked really nice for first few days, I also bought a nice case for it, while leaving work it "" softly "" fell over on its side, while all bundled up in the case. I hade it standing flush against the desk on the floor, the it tipped over on to its side. the next day, I tried to power it up, the green led came on, but that was all that came on, I reaturned it to circuit city, and bought a toshiba."
2,Rating: About 2cc out of 10,"Wax was 10cc founding member Graham Gouldman, who not only penned many of that band's classics but composed mid-60's Top Ten hits for the Yardbirds and the Hollies; coupled with multi-talented U.S. singer-songwriter-musician-producer Andrew Gold. The result? Mike & The Mechanics. In other words, an unchallenging, generic 80's pop sound from a collaboration that looked better on paper. (All that talent, and there's a song called ""Alright Tonight""?!) Maybe Andrew and Graham were being mutually gracious to the point of cancelling each other out. There are a few moments where the potential is realized (""Only A Visitor"", ""Ready Or Not"") and only one tune that hints at past glories (the whitebread faux-reggae of ""Rise Up"" recalls ""Dreadlock Holiday"", but without the sense of irony). Renaissance does a nice job of repackaging and continues to delight collectors like yours truly with thier wallet-friendly ""2-fer"" reissues, but in Wax's case, the music itself is a letdown."
2,This is not horror.. Is a romance story.. Good if you like this kind of movie,For Fullmoon fans this movie is good. The movie is not about 100% horror; isn't the beauty and the beast either. The movie is about a modern princess who did not know about her future as a princess. She felt in love with the wrong guy but later she would be saved by the good one. I did not enjoy too much the movie; not my kind. Burn your copy as I did before is too late. I prefer puppet master and demonic toys. This could be good for people who like some kind of romance and passion in horror movies.
2,Not widescreen,"Amazon lists this re-released version of MERIDIAN from Full Moon as widescreen, but it's not. It's the same old full screen print and it looks *slightly* better than the previous versions of Meridian that were released, but you can barely tell the difference. So, if you were expecting a remastered widescreen super duper special edition, you'll be disappointed. Also, if anyone's interested, the only extra feature is the same Full Moon behind the scenes featurette from the original release. As for the movie, well, it's a weird softcore version of Beauty and the Beast with Sherilyn Fenn and Charlie Spradling, which is either a good thing or bad thing depending on what you're looking for."
4,Ed Wood Special Edition DVD,Great Johnny Depp film ! .... Of course ~ WHAT Johnny Depp film isn'tgreat !?!
2,ed woods,"This rating is for the movie only the service and quality was excellent, but I hated the movie! The worst Johnny Depp ever made!! Ed Woods movie"
5,Finally!!!,One of my all time favorite Tim Burton film is coming out on blu-ray. I can't wait for this movie to come out.
3,Okay,"I have to say, I really liked this when I saw it in a theater, and I rented it for a friend. Well, my friend didn't like it, and I have to say, watching it the second time with her, it seemed quite slow, in a way it didn't seem in the first viewing. So it's not a good movie to see twice, I guess. But it's quirky, and funny, with a performance I didn't expect from Johnny Depp, since his persona is that of a brooder. But here he plays comic stuff well. And I really liked the tolerant, humane philosophy it projected, summed up in the exchange between Johnny Depp and one his crew: ""Ed, you don't judge people."" ""Of course not. If I did, I wouldn't have any friends."" I wish more people in this life had that attitude!"
3,My review of Ed Wood,I think this movie was okay. Nothing great. The acting was good. I found Sarah Jessica Parker's character extremely annoying. Johnny Depp was terrific and so was Martin Landau. I fell in loooooove with Vampira. OMG was she soooo sexy. Patricia Arquette was really cute and I liked her character a lot. Overall a good movie but I didn't mind it ending.
5,Excellent film,"Beautifully acted. Inspiring in its message that dreams count, even if you are not able to fulfill them very well."
5,Where is this fabulous film?,"I watched Ed Wood with my father last summer and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. It is one of those movies that is brilliant both conceptually and dramatically. Johnny Depp is always wonderful, and the sense of humor of the film was refreshingly sophisticated (much too rare in contemporary films.) We laughed so hard we cried.Don't you think Bela did a wonderful job improvising with the motorless octopus? I need to own a copy of Ed Wood! This is my appeal to the powers that be - PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS FILM! Piper Silverthorne"
4,A Great Picture of a Legend who made unforgotten bad ones,"Famed director Tim Burton directed Johnny Depp in their second collaration, the biographical Oscar winning triumph; ""ED WOOD""the story of a director's unforgettable passion for movies and his dreadful vision on directing movies and how his awful films have still been a inspiration. Martin Landau brilliantly and terrifyingly portrays the legendary Bela Lugosi, which got him the oscar for best supporting actor. Sarah Jessica Parker as Eddie's girlfriend Dolores Fuller. One of the most extrodonary biographical films among ""Chaplin"", ""the Aviator"" and ""Cinderella Man"" Johnny Depp's second best film after ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Everyone is very good. Johnny Depp fans see ""ED WOOD"" if you haven't. A Film of a young man whose has stood the test of time as the worst director of all time, but hes honored for his dreadful filmography with Tim Burton's triumph."
3,quick ship,good product but I had to sell it to some one that had an older machine. mine is a windows 7
1,One dimensional,"Larry Summers was Sheryl Sandberg's mentor. A lot of female faculty defended Larry Summers. If these females were not obtuse, they must have good reasons to explain their positions. The book does not describe or explain them."
2,A good story that's far from accurate,"The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the top stumble once in a while."
5,Duffy does it again,"For anyone wanting to get into music that is extremely accessible and yet vastly underrated, this is an album for you. It has been way too long since the release of Music in Colours, and I was wondering what happened to this 80s wunderkind...but he has produced a very balanced album with some great tracks, and the hallmarks of Lilac Time (great lyrics) and catchy Britpop melodies are stronger than ever. It was certainly gonna be difficult to follow up on Music in Colours given the great combo of Duffy and Nigel Kennedy, but there is no doubt in my mind that this album is as good, if not better. Certainly recent involvement in writing songs for Canadian band Crash Test Dummies shows through. A definite buy."
1,"Great artist, Horrible teacher","I understand most Gnomon DVd's are geared towards a more professional audience;However , this DVD is particularly useless. It starts out REALLY bad with things like: ""ummmm ummm I have no idea what I'm going to do...ummm"" He doesn't really give any useful hints as how to help out with your own designs. It may deliver but I got WAY too disappointed at this DVD to even bother finish watching it."
4,Camp Chef Sport Stove,Looked all over and Amazon had the best price. This stove is well made and easy to use. Quick and hassle free set up. The only drawback is its short so you bend over when cooking on it(but I knew that when I bought it from the description).
4,Flame on!,"Bought this as a camp stove. It is POWERFUL! Boils water in 3 minutes. Works best with the diffuser plates. Not too heavy, but uses the large propane bottles. The latches on the side are made from typical cheap Chinese pot metal, and you may have to bend them into shape to get them to work properly, but, this is a minor detail. This is an excellent stove, and , if it has a fault, it would be that it is too hot for eggs, or other easily burned items."
2,"Not Great, Not Horrible","OK, it went straight to dvd and basically it's a rip-off of Goldie Hawn's film, ""Private Benjamin"", but it's not really horrible and there are a fews laughs. As for Jessica Simpson's acting, well it's no worse than her singing. Faint praise to be sure."
3,"It was full of errors, but overall, an okay watch","It was okay overall, there were some part where I was scratching my head going ""What? That doesn't happen in basic"" and etc."
4,Good...realistic,"Good film...realistic. Some might be off base, but not entirely unbelievable. Jessica Simpson does a wonderful job with this plot."
1,Obsolete battery,"Given the problems that other reviewers have reported with this battery jamming in the camera, it should be avoided. Sony appears to have replaced it with the NP-FM500H. The FM500H is compatible with the Sony A100, although the A100 can't display the InfoLithium information. The new battery has the additional advantage of being less expensive."
1,Sony Bad Batery,Amazon has to look into the Sony Brand Battery NP-FM55HThere is a major problem with some these batteries they do fit into the camera. If one forces it into the A-100 DSLR you can not get it out.The Camera has to be returned to Sony. Someone has to get to the bottom of this Sony Problem. You should stop sales on the Battery until Sony corrects the Problem and removes the defective uunits from the market.
5,Creative Labs PCMCIA Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS Notebook,"This sound card is awesome. No more clicking, poping, or anything from my speakers. They put out a great deal of power, and great set of utilities that help choose sound stages, equalizers, THX settings, speaker settings, etc. It also comes with your green,black, and tan cable splitter to use 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, and also 7.1 speakers. I have the Logitech Z-560 4.1 THX certified speakers, and they are awesome. Plus, you get a cool little sticker.Con: because the great deal of power comming from this card, it generates a lot of extra heat, before my laptop didn't get too hot, but since adding the sound card, it gets noticeably hotter. But don't get me wrong, this card is amazing."
5,excellent alternative,I have a laptop with original sound card mother board malfuntioning. The PCMCIA and sound blaster Audigy 2 ZS is a suitable and more powerfull alternative than replacing the whole mother board to solve a audio problem.I am satisfied with this less expensive problem solver.Thanks and regardsGustavo
3,It's good but please NO MORE orchestral albums!,"Performed by an orchestra as a one-off charity event, this album shows how easily Queen's music can be turned into orchestral music (some say it already was.)This is an edited version of that concert (originally performed in 1982) and there are several versions (much more complete) that exist.Some sound rather good as in the case of ""Flash"" (backed by a choir) and others that could've been left off (""Under Pressure"".)""Love of My Life"" makes it out as the most beautiful reworking of the bunch.Not a landmark album, nor original as this same orchestra has given other band's music the same treatment. This is just a curious little jewel in any Queen fan's collection."
4,"No stripes, but still a very nice comforter set for the price!","Like the other reviews, I noticed there were no stripes as there appear to be in the picture, but it's still a lovely comforter. The design is nice, the stripes weren't important to me, so no big deal. The edges of the comforter and the shams are nicely finished with a thick burgundy cord, giving the whole set a nice edged look.We use it on top of our regular down topper instead of using a duvet. The shams are very nice and I like the matching bed skirt. Since we're using it on top of an already thick down comforter, I purchased the California King size for our king bed, and it fits great. Overall, a great value for the price I paid."
1,Goes against so many medical professional's advice.,"Far too rigid and almost impossible for many mother's to follow. Babies don't ""know"" they need to be sticking to her routines. As shown by the reviewer before me, many in the medical profession do not agree with her ideas. I did not know before I got this book this woman doesn't even have any children of her own. And what I really find disturbing is the fact that she threatens websites in England with legal action when they criticize her methods. To me that shows that she's worried that her methods won't stand up."
2,Not useful for me at all.,"somehow i don't like the cry out and tough schedule on little babies. i do think there need to be some routine, but all babies are different. we need to find their schedules by following their own schedules. i don't think this can be achieved by reading this book.whenever my baby cries, i know she is in need. if i impose routine on her by not going to her right away, she will feel insecure, and that insecurity can add up.one time i tried to have my husband takes her to sleep and she cries and cries for 20 minutes, finally falling into sleep. i was relieved at the beginning. but the next morning when she woke up and saw me, i saw the doubt in her eyes. she was only a couple of months old!! since then i don't want to force her to do anything. she does not have an absolute fixed schedule, but she follows her own routine well. that is good enough for me. i am happy if she is happy."
5,it works,"We tried this book as a last resort to get our 6 month old to sleep through the night. I was against it due to the reputation for letting babies ""cry"" BUT that's not what its about and also with a minimal amount of crying within 2 days she sleeps from 7pm to 7am plus 2 naps WITHOUT the pacifier, so we conquered 2 problems at once. The routines seemed counter-intuitive at first (wake at 7am, back to sleep at 9am and 12.30am again), but they fitted in perfectly it seems with the natural biorhythm of a child her age. I find the feeding advice less, particularly since I'm still breastfeeding and 3 times per day only at this stage is less than what she needs (wants?). Viva Gina!!"
4,Wait a minute...!,"Gina Ford has been pilloried for her approach on child-management, but think about what her books are: they are guides for people who need guides to parenting.When I was alone in London with my first child, my husband and I had no local grandparents or friends to give us advice. Gina Ford's basic routines gave me an idea of how much sleep a baby needs, how much food they require and how often they eat, etc. She goes to great detail, is indeed a bit fascist, and doesn't say a word about the (very important) emotional needs of children. She is, after all, writing as a maternity nurse, not a parent.There is nothing better for parents than to ignore books and just use common sense. That said, I still use her basic routines for naps and mealtimes now that I am a comfortable, relaxed, Mother of four. Many of my friends have a copy of The Contented Little Baby on their shelves to use as a reference. Take what is useful from the book and ignore the rest; it is not a bible!"
3,The new contented little ADULT - it's about sleep!,"The main purpose of this book is to have your baby sleeping through the night asap. To achieve this, it is recommended that the routine be followed word for word. This is unnecessary in my opinion and thank goodness for that because the routine is strict and not at all flexible.I stick to the feeding times in the book at that's about it and at 3 months, my daughter is sleeping through the night. The rest of it is unnecessary. I bath her whenever I feel like it, she naps during the day whenever she feels tired. I take her out whenever the spirit moves me. I only make sure she eats at the times indicated by the routine and that she gets no more than 4 hours of sleep during the day and this has been enough for her to sleep from 10.30pm through to 6am every night.So don't get discouraged if you find it difficult to stick to the routine. Just stick to the feeding times and you should have success."
1,Harsh and insensitive,"If you are more concerned with making YOUR life easy than you are with raising a happy, healthty child then this is the book you want to read. It is overly concerned with how to make a baby fit into your life, rather than teaching you how to raise your baby with compassion and kindness. I would recommend The Baby Book by Sears and The No-Cry Sleep Solution by Pantley instead."
3,This book is too rigid in practice!,"I was so motivated to put my son on a sleeping/eating schedule, and so that's why I bought this book. I agree with what the author is teaching in this book, however, in practice it's too hard! I think this book will be great for stay-at-home moms in that they can follow the schedule of feeding/sleeping times, and it also depends on the baby. I'm almost a stay at home mom working only 3 days/week (12 hour shifts) and my husband works M-F, and, even If I put my son on a schedule, when I'm at work, my mom takes care of my son; and she's unable to follow the schedule or even my husband when I have to work on a Saturday! Also, my son in his early weeks of life up to now (he is now 5 months) has always been a very light sleeper, sensitive to his environment and who cat-naps throughout the day ; therefore, a rigid sleeping routine never worked for him!"
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"A lot of the stuff Gina says is 'common sense'.The schedule she sets out is pretty rigid, but I know people who've managed to follow them more or less (usually there's only 1 kid in the household). Mainly, Gina doesn't really take into account other factors affecting the schedule: going out with grandparents for lunch and/or dinner, playdates with other babies, how older siblings affect the parents' ability to abide by the schedule, or even just being loud and constantly waking the baby, etc. She makes it sound so easy, but when your 6-week old is wailing non-stop when she's supposed to be 'drowsy', do you let her cry her lungs out, or are you going to pick her up?Admittedly, her methods have worked for many people; but at the end of the day, Gina's not there with you in your house when your baby acts up. You just have to use your own instincts to understand how to best cope."
4,Babybook review,very informative and helpful. My nephew had used the book on their baby and she is proof the method works. I purchased the book to give to my neighbor who is expecting their first child in January.
2,Better do what she says - or else!,"Although this book contains lots of great advice, the author's tone is somewhat ""matronly"" and can be a little grinding. I think this book would work better if it wasn't all written in the 1st person.Another minor gripe is the inconsistancy of her treatment of ""experts"". Sometimes she'll start a sentence along the lines of ""Although some 'experts' recommend... I find that"", whilst at other times she will say ""Studies show that..."" and use the information to support her view.I guess if you are (un)lucky enough not to have any fussy relatives around to tell you how to bring up your baby, this book will make sure you don't miss out on that joyful experience.I'm sure she knows what's worked for her, but we found a lot of her advice to be impractical to our personal situation.Worth a read though - so head to the library... :)"
3,Creepy but not a lot of meat to it,"This is one of the most suspenseful, scariest movies I've seen in a long time, maybe ever. On the other hand, it suffers from a lack of plot. Why is all this happening? Who is the truck driver? Why can the character of the mother succeed in saving her children once, but not twice? Why does the main character have an off-screen child who reads the opening and closing (and pretentious) voice-overs? What are the rules that allow the ghosts to be solid sometimes and ghost-like at others? I don't know, and eventually the lack of plot hurts the movie. It feels incomplete and you'll be scratching your head -- albeit from behind the couch with all the lights on."
2,It had potential,"I was so excited to receive this book in the mail but was saddened and disheartened by its representation of the Mormon faith (I know by writing this some may get the book simply for that.) I feel that the authors would have written a far different story had they actually spoken to a member of this Church. Whether or not they believe as we do, this people's history is integral and closely entwined to this country's. My hope that those who read this realize that the information listed (regarding the basic beliefs of the Mormon religion) is false and distorted. And while I cede this book was not written for those seeking to know more of this Church, I am disappointed because I know some will close this book and it will become all they've ever learned of it. I encourage you to carefully consider purchasing a book that contains this false information.This fact alone made me put down the book... Thus I cannot review any of the remaining content."
5,WILD BILL HICKOK,"James Butler Hickok (a.k.a. Wild Bill) was the most notorious man in the Wild West. A gunfighter, gambler, civil war spy, Indian fighter, peace officer, Hickok was said to have killed more than 100 men but the real total was closer to 10. Widely recognized as the man, who won the first classic gunfight on the streets of Springfield Missouri in 1865. He was shot dead in Deadwood South Dakota ten years later. This DVD explores the man, the myths, and his legends like nothing else you have ever seen."
2,Don't expect great value for your money,"My son likes the way this costume looks but don't expect too much for your money. The ""helmet"" is made of material and doesn't look too realistic. The material used for the costume is cheap and the edges are not finished like a piece of clothing should be. It is what it is."
3,"An ordinary Disney coloring book - not sure what they mean by ""Super""..","This is a nice enough Disney coloring book with all of the Cinderella characters included, but it is a standard-sized coloring book - roughly 50 pages or so...not one of the SUPER sized books that I've purchased before that must contain around 300 pages. So, I'm not sure what the manufacturer means by Super, but anyway, for $5.00 it's a good deal and keeps my four year old girl occupied."
4,Modern life,"A fantastically concocted farce. A fifties-clad sexually attractive, aimless, partying nerd with horn rimmed glasses and no hindsight is manhandled by his lesbian mother and her hot blooded lover. They teach him to accept his place as father/brother at the bottom of the totem pole in the family.For viewers/readers not familiar with Icelandic movies, many are made but few appear outside Scandinavia. Iceland has the highest litracy and readership rate in the world, and the highest rate of book publications. Historocally, since settlement by Norwegians (and some Scots) avoiding kingly rule in the 9th century, Icelanders have been a highly literate and democratic society. See the more modern books by Haldor Laxness, e.g., or Snorre Sturlasonn's history of the kings of Norway (written in the 13th century). [...]"
2,Boring and a big disappointment,The movie had no plot. What a sorry love story if that is what is was. The dancing was okay but don't get it if you think you're going to learn some new moves. The actors and actresses were not attractive at all. I guess they were considered good looking in the 80's.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this because my teenage son and his girlfriend loved Take The Lead and were interested in learning more about latin dancing. The dancing is marginal but the dialogue and acting are TERRIBLE! We couldn't watch it after the first 20 minutes - even the teenagers who, quite frankly, are not the best judges of acting!"
5,A Five Star Masterpiece,"Its difficult to find all the right words for a film score that literally can bring you to tears. That is the result of a brilliant and moving composition of a reacurring main theme thoughout the soundtrack. Rarely do you find music of its kind that has the ability to tug at the heart strings in such a way as in Portman's score to give you a feeling of inner peace. With haunting overtones of Asian flavor, to experience the melodious themes of The Joy Luck Club will prove to be a rewarding experience not to be forgotten. BRAVO PORTMAN!"
4,Title Page Holders,"The page protectors are just right for the 5x7 format used in teaching. They are ideal for use as a divider for each lesson without having to create ""tabs"" that can be time consuming and cumbersome. Excellent!DK"
2,Poor mounting design,"Nice tools, but the mounting design is poor. Not made for all bike seats.Fits neither of my bikes because the mount (fixer) is not adjustable toseat rails. It will only fit one configuration. How many seat designs arethere? Hundreds? Come on guys, even a WOMAN (me!) could have madea better design! I'm now carrying the thing around in my bike basket!Patooooy!"
4,Great Inexpensive Solution - tough to open the top!,"These are a great product except for one small flaw. The plastic sleeves stick together so tightly from the factory, that they are difficult to open up the pocket for insertion of the sheets. (thus, I give it four stars.)Everything else is great! Clear, clean, easily dispensed boxes. Inexpensive, and exactly what we needed. Thanks!~jewels"
1,Challenging,"I found Peak States of Consciousness very challenging to read. Way to much science for the average reader.I am open to alot and found the whole conception trauma a bit too much to believe. Wow, I hope that's not true. Birth trauma I get."
4,Fun!,"My son received a pair of these as a gift for Christmas a year or two ago. They were such a hit that my daughter had to have some of her own to play with him. They love to slide around the carpet and play all sorts of games they make up. The skates slide around on carpet very nicely. The only problem we have had is that my son's skates are starting to crack. If they crack so badly that they are unusable, we will have to buy another pair. They have so much fun with the skates that it would be worth it to replace them."
4,Sock Last Longer With These,"My daughter received these as a gift, and she's used them several times. We both wish that she had more long hallways or open spaces to really test them out, but overall she seems to enjoy them. The big plus for me? A lot less sliding around in socks!"
1,rip off,this is a total rip off. may as well put some plastic bags over your feet. will probably work better.
3,Disappointing Follow-up to the First Perfecto Breaks,"The second (and I believe the last installment) of Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Breaks (short) series has Rennie Pilgrem mixing it up.Despite this album being an obvious break beat set also, that is pretty much where the similarities between Pilgrem's and Lee Coombs' (very successful) series premier end.This album holds truer to being a mixed set. Track transitions are much longer than Coombs. Pilgrem also went with more recent (for 2003) track selection, but unfortunately chose to fuse tracks on two seperate occasions (tracks 10 and 12). Never been a big fan of track fusion.The end result is an average break beat album that is much more edgy compared to Coombs, and consequently, much less fun.3/5 stars for this one."
4,Natural High - Bloodstone,My husband was very pleased with this product and with the speed with which everything was handled. We will definetly continue to purchase products through Amazon.Com in the future.
2,natural high,"very disappointing when compared to ""go on and cry"". song selection is very poor. ""natural high"" is really the only worthwhile song on the cd."
3,URBAN slow dance.,"If a book can grab me within the first 50 pages, then I'm hooked. With URBAN ROMANCE, it took a little longer to get the story going, but because I paid for the book, I decided to keep going. It definitely got better, but it would have been better to not spend so much time on slow introductions of the major players. Sometimes, that can wear the story down quicker than a three course meal. Still, a good book"
3,great concept but...................,This is a great idea but it is made very cheaply. The mesh razor cover bent and I got scratched really badly.
1,What a piece of garbage - cut me to shreds........,"Are you kidding me? I thought the price was a good deal, but boy was I taught a lesson. First off, the thing weighs about 10 lbs or something like that. #2, the thing is made pretty cheap and noisy. #3, The handle is too small for me and I can't reach my back more than the back of my shoulders. #4 These daggers of a blade cut me up horribley when I tried to shave my chest. I looked like I was in a fight with a bear. #5 It took about 50 sweeps in each spot to shave my hair off. #6, No way would I put this thing on my face. #7 and most importantly - I am pissed and I want my money back. It doesn't deserve the 1 star I am forced to give by Amazon."
4,Razor V3i,i jusy bought the v3i and i liked alot the only poblem i had with this phone is that is a little fragil.Besides this it a very good and cool celular phone and i recomend this for to anyane who want to buy a phone.
2,Beauty but no brain,"I agree with the other reviewer that this phone stores the same contacts multiple times. i.e. same name with cell, home, work and email address would be stored as 4 different entries. So now if you have 100 contacts stored on your phone with four different numbers(cell,home,work,email etc), there will be 400 entries stored in your phone. and if you have to browse through then there are 400 entires to go through. Very very annoying feature.Did Motorola ever tested this phone before releasing. I guess not. What a waste of money. I am giving it 2 stars only because I am able to make phone calls with it!"
1,WHERE IS ALL THE MUSIC,I want to know where all the music that was in the movie? I was very disappointed. Not worth the money or effort.
3,Not so tuff!,"We thought that an industrial strength Ball would do the trick for my dog, but she was able to chew through it in about 10-15 minutes."
4,Rated G? No way!,A good film and indeed timely in regard to the Elian case. But for the life of me I can't imagine how it received a G rating. There is one scene in particular in which the two boys have been beaten up and striped naked and I mean totally naked with everything showing! SOUTH PARK was rated R due to some bad language. Can someone please explain this.
5,This movie knocks on the door of your emotional side.,"I thought that this movie was outstanding. To me this movie doesn't compare with the Gonzalas Case at all. This movie shows the love between a father and his sons. The father goes through a great deal of trouble to insure that his children would have a better life that he couldn't provide for them. In the end, he realizes that it's not the love for a better life that the children want, but it is the love of their father. This movie made me think about my own family and made me thankful for what I have and at ease about the things that I don't have. I definitely would not recommend it to little children, because I don't think that they would understand it and it has profanity, but it is a superb PG-13 movie. Two Thumbs Up!!!"
3,"Eh, Okay","The first issue I have with this book is the quality of the figures. Some of them are fuzzy/blurry as if they were copied and pasted at low resolution. The little CD icon is really fuzzy. I feel that for such a high cost book, the quality of the figures should be higher. Also, there is no glossary. There are words in bold, but no glossary to look them up it. This really irritating and a personal pet peeve of mine. Also, I feel that the text itself is not as clear or well organized as it could be. For example, the alpha and beta designations of sugars is never properly explained. In general, this book is acceptable, but there has to be a better book out there.Also! Grisham and Garret are the authors of TWO biochem books. Double check before you order. I accidentally ordered the wrong one the first time."
1,Worst biochemistry book ever written.,Taking an intro class into biochem I found this book very hard to follow very vague and basically lots of big words were used to confuse me the reader. I hate this book with a passion and feel that lehninger accompanied by any biochem review book is worth your money if this is required in your course tell your proff about lehninger the gold standard of biochemistry.LEHNINGER is the only way biochem should be taught.THIS BOOK SUCKS
4,His Eye Is On The Sparrow,"This version of ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow"" by Lauryn Hill & Tanya Blount is the best I have EVER heard. It will give you goosebumps. I'm going to buy this CD just for that song."
4,Molly's thoughts,"My mom bought this for me for a replacement Christmas present. (I got the Quik Clik House for Christmas and it broke RIGHT AWAY and I was very sad and mad, then my mom read the reviews about it from other people and I decided I didn't want a new one.)I like to play with Lila and her horse because it's cool how she fits in the carriage and you can ride her around in it. The clothes are really cool too. I have the boy in the ski shop set too and I like to play with them together. I just turned 11 and I still LOVE Polly Pockets!"
5,Beautiful bracelet.,I love this little bracelet. It is so cute and it feels really comfortable on. I have received lots of compliments. Great price for a good product.
1,Probably the most expensive pen in the world to operate!,"These pens write well as long as they have ink in them. Unfortunately, they use ink at about the same rate as a fountain pen, and each refill costs about $3 each. Mine last for about two months of very occasional use. I'm glad that Cross discontinued these items and I urge everyone who reads this review to avoid them."
2,Not worth $70 IMO,"I'm sorry I don't think this is worth $70 IMO. When I got this in the mail I was shocked. It is so lightweight, it's like something you could have made yourself. There is static as the other reviewer stated, but that only happens to my hair when it's really straight after I've flat ironed it. When it's real straight my hair is more thin, and this brush will stir up cradle cap. However, when my hair is thick in it's natural state, this nylon brush does not go through to the scalp like they say it will.I have a $5 Goody nylon brush that works better than this. The only difference is that the teeth on this brush are closer together, whereas the Goody's teeth are a little wider. But the Goody is heavier and appears more durable. Also, it is a pain trying to keep this clean. They give you a smaller cleaning brush that works quite well, but you can't get this brush wet or have natural hair oils left in it. I won't purchase this again."
5,"Unrefuted, Unrebutted","This book has stood the test of time. Despite all the carping of the Clinton Crazies, none have been able to factually refute what's in this expose. A pity more haven't read this, since Lyons' voice in the wilderness has accurately skewered the ""accuracy"" of one of America's icons, The New York Times. Had everyone been paying attention, the Starr investigation may have wound down much sooner, and Wen Ho Lee may have been spared being called a traitor based on the usual inaccurate, slanderous reporting of the Times' Jeff Gerth.The anti-Clinton comments in these reviews are, in hindsight, kind of funny. One writer couldn't wait for Ken Starr to tell us the real truth about Whitewater. Well, he has, and he was forced to admit that there was no scandal there after all. The other anti-Clinton comments are notably lightweight, since they in no way even attempt to factually refute this book.Because they can't."
5,Wonderful book,"I was given this book as a child. It was already very old then. The stories are wonderful and the illustrations are superb! In recent years, I decided to try to find another copy, so I've been on the lookout; then I saw this listing. I was overjoyed to find a copy of my beloved book in such wonderful condition and at such a great price. I'll treasure it!"
2,There's no ATI Mobility Radeon 7500,"Contrary to the technical data presented here, this product does NOT ship with ATI's Mobility Radeon 7500C video board. The video board is instead ATI's Radeon IGP 340M, which is based on an old Radeon technology (for a comparison between Mobility Radeon and Mobility Radeon 7500 see the site tomshardware.com). For those interested in playing new 3D games, this is a no-no. Besides that, the system comes with a poor selection of cheap softwares and games, which in the end eat up 7GB of your hard drive. The fan is also particularly loud and annoying. The only + goes to its sleek design."
4,Worth every penny!,"I must agree with Dave from Oregon. This laptop is great! ... The only gripe I have is the fan. It's a bit on the loud side. I don't notice my friends with DELL or IBM making this much noise. The screen is clear, the keyboard is responsive and the quick buttons at the top of the keyboard eliminate steps as well as room on the Taskbar or desktop. I just wish they put hardkey DVD controls on the front or side (volume is there). Overall, a great machine for the money!"
4,"Neat, Clean Book.","This book is not bad at all. A comprehensive guide to many techniques which I hadn't ever even heard of. Though the lack of photographs is slightly..offputting, the drawn images somehow seem clearer and add neatness to the book. This is a book that I would reccomend to new and and slightly more advanced knitters, though nothing more. The patterns involving the skills you've learnt from reading the book are simple and mostly for children. Buy this book if you like clean, streamlined things, easy to read and understand tutorials and how-to's and aren't really looking for a pattern book.Simply put, this is an exellent book for beginners, though the pattenrs are slightly plain."
4,It was a good book with new ideas,"The book was a gift to my friend, she knits all the time and reallly enjoyed learning some new things.....and liked the book. I will send it to my other knitting friend.......maybe, just maybe I will get a pair of knitted socks........Enjoy!"
3,Not my favorite,"Very informative. However, I bought the Crochet School and it was photographs. I had read a review that this was too. It isn't. Not my favorite book."
3,Holiday story,We got this DVD after seeing a preview on another DVD. The cartoon graphics were not as expected and the story did not keep my son's attention.
5,An enduring favorite,"Absolutely love these guys! I've been a huge fan since hearing Chris Cornell's Euphoria Morning and making the connection. Eleven was pretty much the backup band for that album, in case you missed it.It's pretty amazing though - musicians generally love this stuff, but the general public doesn't seem to get it. Oh well..."
3,"Good, but not his best swing...","Don't get me wrong, this is a good recording by the absolute master! But, if you are looking for a more rockin' time look elsewhere (in Brian's catalog, of course!). If you are a big fan, buy this. If not, buy a later Setzer Orchestra cd, & work your way to this."
3,The grieving process,"Walking on Water was critically acclaimed upon its release in 2002 in Australia. It focusses on a range of individuals who are all linked to a friend who has died of AIDS, assisted by euthanasia. However, the euthanasia does not work, so one of the friends (Charlie) helps the process by placing a plastic bag over his head. This, of course fuels much friction with the remaining friend's, even with Charlie himself who now has to live with the guilt of what he has done.Walking on Water has moments of brilliance, but overall it is not the masterpiece I had been told it was. I found it difficult to care for any of the characters, and at the end of the day, that was the director's intention (I think)."
5,Into Another is Smooooth,"This is one of the most relaxing, passionate alterna-rock/indie/punk records I own. It's absolutely an essential, if you can track it down. There is just something about this band- mellow and desperate at the same time. I normally don't like anything that could be cast under the rock heading but... just wow."
5,"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy",This book does a wonderful job of taking the scientific information available regarding nutrition and puts it a format the lay public can easily understand. Very professional.
5,Solid advice for weight control and healthy nutrition,"Before selecting this book, I reviewed a number of publications. The other reviewed publications had a whacko ""feel"" about the great results their programs would deliver. This book sounded solid (backed up by Harvard Medical School) and the book lives up to its billing delivering sound nutritional advice. I recommend this book highly."
4,Great Advice,"Finally! A book with some real information I can use to make my diet healthier and remain easy to follow. I only take off a star because a lot of the information was repeated over and over and over. The book could have easily been slimmed down 100 pages without losing any content. I also appreciate the sample menus and recipes in the back. Overall, I think everyone should be forced to read this book- our collective health would be much better!"
5,"Simple, Common Sense Nutrition Advice and Guidelines","This book was recommended to me by my doctor when I asked him some questions about nutrition. I quite enjoyed this book and most certainly feel it was worth my while. There's not much that's mind-blowing here, there's no easy or magic secret to good health, but it spells out proper nutrition clearly and concisely and does recommend some foods you may not know of or consider, like quinoa as an example. The book is based on years of research, and I have no doubt that anyone's health would improve by following the advice in Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy."
5,healthy nutrition review,thouht it was well written and contain a lot of information about eating right that can be applied to ones life.
3,A Thoughtful And Academic Read,"This book does a good job of delineating the factors in planning and practicing the consuming of a healthy diet and nutritional principles. It most definitely have an academic flavor, and is the type of book that you would want to pick up to do research on the subject of health and nutrition.Overall, I found the book informative interesting but not necessarily riveting in the detailed explanation of dietary factors from one chapter to the next."
1,You have to be rich to buy Epson 4000,"FACTSWhen the ink jets are not clogged in works great.I spend more money on head cleanings that I do prints.Buy a few extra maintence tanks, you'll need them.Eight of the the big cartrages will cost you only 800 dollers !The printer cloggs overnight so If you dont print every day you will have to clean the heads at least five times. and as you know cleaning uses lots of ink.For conveince just send Epson the # to your bank account."
1,Get the right formatted DVD,"Before selling a disk to someone in the US when the product is sold from outside the US, it might be helpful to inform the buyer about different settings/formats for DVD players. I can't access the DVD because it was coded or designed for a different country's DVD player. I realize experience is the greatest teacher, but it's annoying to spend money on a product I can't use.My advice: don't buy DVDs from a foreign source or read the fine print. I'd love to watch this movie, but alas, I have to find the right formatted one to be able to view it."
1,no help from customer service,"Being a new grandmother, I am not familiar ith chilrens' toys and books. I bought this because of the name touch pad, but apparently my daughteer said she needed something special to show or use it and didnn't have it, so the bopok was useless. I tried to write customer service to find out what was lacking, but got no help."
4,fun hair accessory,"These hair sticks are pretty and practical. I ordered the red, and the color is a true and semi-transparent red with a frosted or matte finish instead of a shiny crystal finish. The center stone is an AB crystal. The prongs are very sturdy. I bought five hair sticks, and they hold my long, thick hair in a perfect bun without other pins. The prongs are not long enough, in my opinion, for only one or two hair sticks to hold long, thick hair."
1,TOO SMALL,I read the reviews saying this would fit my car and it was great. it turned out it was 2 inches to small for my 97 accord SE. Don't buy
4,Great Map! Best I've seen...,"I have been to Beijing 4 times and took this map for my last 12 day visit. It was GREAT! Got me to all my meetings, Olympic events, and even my native friends were loving my Map! If only they could do more maps on every district in BJ, but then you would need a book. Worth every penny I paid! Thank YOU."
4,"great shoe, but not for me","Great shoe, extremely light weight. Unfortunately, not the correct build for my biomechanics. If you are a smaller runner without pronation trouble or prone to injuries, this would be a great light-weight trainer."
2,Mr. Bean fans will be disappointed,"Yep, yours truly is a big Mr. Bean fan, but I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. The plot is pretty dumb, but there are plenty of dumb-plot movies that are well made. This one is not one of them. From the very beginning you'll find yourself disappointed by the acting and the editing. This is one of the films where things just don't flow. There are very few truly funny moments. Even the bathroom scene where JE dances to the camera-in-the-mirror feels trite and stupid, not funny. Maybe as a big Mr. Bean fan I was expecting something half decent, and as a huge James Bond fan I was expecting a comedy that properly insults the real 007 series. On both counts, I was let down tremendously."
1,Bad Quality,"This was listed as used but very good condition. Unfortunately, about 30 minutes into the movie it became unwatchable as the disc was clearly damaged. Amazon were excellent in their customer service refunding me the cost of the movie and giving me a shipping label, but it cost me almost the price of the movie to buy a new padded envelope to return it even though postage was paid (I hadn't kept the packaging it came in - too trusting I guess!)"
2,Silly British Humor,"The British try to hard to be funny in this movie. While the storyline kept my interest, the humor was too juvenile for me. I would not recommend purchasing this movie unless you get it for $4.00 or less. When the movie is over with you just feel like it was a waste of time."
3,Lightweight Bond Spoof,"This James Bond spoof, headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson, was okay....a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection.......but it's worth a rental.Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill, a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs. Both are likable guys.John Malkovich plays a Frechman here and his accent is pretty good. He seems to be always playing strange roles.There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film. Except for a very funny toilet scenes, much of it isn't that memorable. Just a lightweight hour-and-a-half of entertainment."
1,Don't Bother - 1 star because negative stars not available,This movie is not worth the time spent to watch it. If you wish to see why then watch it and you will understand.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen...,"I saw this movie with a bunch of family and friends at a theater in Brandon, Florida. I like lots of different kinds of movies and can find something redeeming in most. This wasn't one of them. Unless you really get into toilet humor (no pun intended) or are a pre-teen (see toilet humor), or maybe like torturing small animals (and this movie made me feel like the animal), it is a total waste of time. There is nothing creative or unique...and little that is funny. To compare it to Austin Powers is a farce. The trailer was funny and promising. Unfortunately, that's all she wrote."
3,A mediocre movie by an excellent comedian,"I am a big fan of Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean). I have seen his TV sitcom and his stand-up comedy shows. I hate to say that this movie fell below my expectation gauging from his past movies/shows. There are a some hilarious moments at times, but some of the comic scenes were predictable. Mr. Atkinson's movie usually start with him being a silly and childish character which would got him into some sticky situations. But he always ended the movie by solving the problem with his unique, smart, creative, and hilarious way; in other word the Rowan Atkinson's way. That is one component that I feel was missing from the ending of Johnny English."
5,Johnny English!,"I will be truthful I had my doubts on this movie. So I passed it up in the theaters! BIG MISTAKE! Johnny English is what english comedy is. If you thought Austin Powers was a brillant spoof on spy action flicks, you haven't met the one true class act of comedic spy action, Johnny English! Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean, Rat Race) delves deep into his already huge portfolio of comedic appearances and brings out the best of what a spy comedy is. Other credible talents are Natalie Imbruglia (singer, actress), John Malcovich (Con Air, Being John Malcovich) etc. Johnny English is a perefect comedy.. and just to note, my favorite scene is when he has his partner Bough play the contents of the DVD he confiscated! You wanna know what is on it... well, watch the movie!"
1,Didn't work for us,"We live within a 10-25 mile radius of all broadcast towers in our metro region. After reading so many positive reviews for this product, we decided to give it a try.Our results were nowhere near what others have experienced. The only time either analog or digital broadcast signals were available for viewing was with the unit turned off. It was only able to pick up about half of the stations, which is significantly worse performance than traditional ""rabbit ears."""
2,fastest return ever,"i bought it on sale with my tv at sears for 20 bucks. when i got it home i hooked it and went through the channel scan operation at least 30 times!!! in ever part of my room, i even balanced atop 32""lcd tv and i found 3 channels!!!!!bottom line i had an older version along time ago and it worked well in town, but if your more than 20 miles from any tv tower forget it. pony up the dough for a real good out-door antenna."
1,Philips antenna,"The antenna I received was not the product number I ordered, so maybe the opinion is skewed. One tech support call said it was probably the wrong antenna; the second said the number had been changed but the antenna was the same. In any case, it was totally useless. The TV would pick up only one or two channels when the antenna was plugged into the wall, even if it wasn't connected to the TV itself. Furthermore, tech support said I needed to aim the antenna directly at the broadcast tower for each channel (within 10 degrees), and that I had to rescan the full channel range every time I changed channels. I said that was ridiculous, the response was ""That's what HD is like."" I've gone back to the cheap antenna that gets everything but 6 and 12, and am considering a roof antenna."
2,JUNK!!!,"I used to have one of these until today. With this antenna, I could get a maximum of 2 HD channels (actually both were from CBS so really 1 channel). I just bought the Terk HDTVa amplified indoor antenna today, and guess what? 10 channels!!! I think that's every channel currently being broadcast in my area. And I live 33 miles from the towers. That should tell you everything you need to know."
1,Broken out of the box,"The power connection to the power supply was out of line and recessed so far into the housing, you could not connect the power to the antenna. Works fine for HD channels without power, but did not amplify hard to receive regular channels. Won't be factor come Feb. when everything is HD."
2,dissapointed,Too much money for the poor performance provided.It doesn't really boost the indoor signal.I wish I didn't spent so much in it.
2,Not that Good,"After reviewing this product on your website and reading other reviews. I thought i was purchasing a great product. But to my surprise..it's not that great at all. And on top of that, I brought (2) and one of the antennas had a broken connector..(beat that). So to anyone interested in purchasing this item..please reconsider."
1,marilyne las vegas,"This antenna was a dissappointment. I used it on a non-hdtv. I have an unobstructed path from Sunrise Mt. where the tower is. I live about 1 1/2 miles from the base of the 4,000 ft. mt. I tried many things, but each channel wanted a different setting, and even then nothing came in very clear. I bought a Terk TV5 and couldn't believe how great it was. The Terk TV5 is the best antenna I've ever owned."
1,worse than Radio Shack,"Like other reviewers, I found the signal came in better as I was removing it: Reception cleared up when I pulled the power plug! Have gone back to my $10 Radio Shack antenna, which is very good in cold weather. I'll ""make do"" next summer and until DTV is mandatory."
2,Bad performance,Bad performance with very frequent drop-offs and long signal interruptions in city – close to signal source. Ability to maintain uninterrupted signal with Phillips antenna worse than with a $30.00 RCA antenna.
3,Best performer in my difficult situation,"I've been given the unenviable task of setting up several ATSC conversion boxes in the non-cable-wired rooms of our large house. One, in particular, is the kitchen which is on the ground floor. It sits in between two other houses and even by the windows there is no clear line of sight to the sky. Analog reception using a set-top antenna is static and noise most of the time. I'd tried the Silver Sensor, Antennas Direct DB2, and an old amplified Terk that looks like a bowtie lying flat on a spinner. None would reliably get more than 3 of the dozen-or-so ""local"" (8 miles or so) channels. The Philips only misses 1 of the ""local"" channels and is touchy on one more. The ability to rotate and tilt the UHF element is key, as you can usually fiddle with it to fix up a channel that is breaking up into digital noise."
2,Ineffective,"Out of 14 available digital signals in this area, this antenna picked up 4. It has been returned."
1,i got used item,"it supposed to new item, but i got used one... amazon sucks... the first time i buy at amazon, n it very dissapointed"
3,Not as good as the movie,The music does not stand alone without the movie scenes. Yet it invited one to rediscover Pablo Neruda's poetry in its historical contest
2,About Schmidt - Take me to the movie - PLEASE,"All I can say is I was dissapointed. I mean, am I supposed to like this man? He seems way too self centered, too indulgent in his own pity to bother to see how much he has/had going for him. Also, can someone wake Mr. Begley up and let him know that all these women throwing themselves at Schmidt at one time or another ends up being ridiculous?!! Just wouldn't happen. Maybe if Schmidt were Mick Jagger or something we'd find this slightly believabale. Begley may be a good writer, (dialogue esp.) but i would much rather watch Jack on the screen who atleast brought something likeable to this character. I would do an about face before I read another About Schmidt."
3,Entertaining and Fun,"I enjoyed this book about a retired lawyer who's wife recently dies. The majority of the book deals with the man's loneliness and how he fills his days. It is quite entertaining.It's not the best book I've read recently, but it's fun. There is really no plot and nothing is resolved in the book (maybe 'cuz there's a sequel), but I would still recommend it when you're looking for something light to read."
3,Amusing... but not much,"Wish I'd listed to ""A Class Act"". I was probably expecting too much but this book was a big let-down. It's not particularly funny. And I, too, didn't care for some of the lines passed off as humor. I didn't care for the of drawing style either. It's not a total cat-astrophe but it may be the first book I actually sell."
5,Good Music!,"Is this vintage Queen?....The answer is no, but it doesn't have to be vintage to be great. MIH is mainly soft rock songs mixed with some pop elements. I like every song on this album, and you can't even say that about some of Queens best efforts, It's very consistent from beginning to end. My favorites are ""made in heaven"" The last vocal performance from freddie ""mother love"" roger talyors sublime ""heaven for everyone"" and freddie's last written song ""a winter tale"" is simply one of my favorite songs ever, very moving. It truly is good music."
5,For hardcore Queen fans and those that never liked them.,"My recurring thought when listening to this CD is that Freddie Mercury died far to young, as he obviously had much more to give the music world. This is the best album that Queen has produced. I have listened to this CD every week since buying it in 1996, something that I can say for very few others. There are no weak tracks, and my favorite song seems to change on a regular basis. ""Too Much Love Will Kill You"" and ""Let Me Live"" are Mercury at his best. This last effort rivals any of the Greatest Hits compilations, and will go down on my list of all time favorites."
4,Thinking differently,"Through eight simple rules, I learned not only how to do business differently, but how to see business differently-to think in a way that maximizes the innate resourcefulness of everyone I lead. The book is especially useful to those whose jobs demand constant creativity and innovation."
2,BUY MAHAN KHALSA FIRST BOOK,"If you like something serious and practical I recommend you buy the book that MAHAN KHALSA one of the contributing author of previously wrote LET'S GET REAL or Let's not play. Its a much better book and more precise. Even better, get the audio tape or CD read by Mahan. I gave this book a real 5. businessThink is a real waste of money if you have read Mahan's first book which I rated a rare 5. I am real fan of FranklinCovey books besides other best selling books."
4,"Perfect transaction, fast shipping","I bought this use book, doubting myself, but it came out perfect and fast, it got to my apt before the Christmas gifts. good quality and transaction."
4,helping young children flourish,"A good addition to the attachment parent's library. It is a relief to understand that temper tantrums are not so much about children ""controlling"" parents as trying to get what they need. Attention is a legitimate need."
5,"Papa, can I have 3 pills tonight",Addictive and fun. Good for exploring color combinations...although my son just wants to put all the colors in.
4,Haunting as the movie!,"If you love the score then listen to Sarah Brightman sing the theme song on her ""Time to say goodbye"" CD. Called ""Noone like you"". It just grabs your heart and soul and takes to your new heights."
5,Carmen,"She DID sing Michaela. And it's said that she also did Carmen. But if she did, she was completely miscast. She also did Aida, live-recording of her Aida is...interesting. Anyway, Sills rules in the French rep, esp. as Manon."
2,Not what I was looking for...,"My favorite perfume for many years was Woods of Windsor Lavender Eau de PARFUM...I have asthma and many scents really bother me...this one did not, and I always received favorable comments when wearing it. Now I can't get the PARFUM...I tried the body spray AND now this Eau de TOILETTE, and THEY ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SCENTS,and unfortunately, THEY BOTHER MY ASTHMA! I don't mean to malign this product; I'm hoping that someone who reads this can direct me to my original favorite, the Eau de PARFUM. I don't know why they stopped making THIS particular product, but THIS girl really misses it! Funny, you'd think the scents of lavender would all be the same in the parfum/body spray/eau de toilette, but some ingredient(s) are either left out or added and the result is markedly different. Thanks for ""listening""..."
2,Unhappy with pen,This pen will not write smoothly and continuously. It skips or simply won't write at all. I've even tried a new ink cartridge and keep getting the same result. Disappointed to say the least.
3,Janes Vintage Aircraft,"With 460+ aircraft this anthology is very comprehensive and will no doubt fulfil the need of someone who wants descriptions of the class of aircraft presented here.The operative word here is ""descriptions"" and while this is invaluable in showing what the aircraft looks like and in listing the performance statistics, it does not, however provide the main thing I was hoping for. That is a three view drawing which could be enlarged by the purchaser of the book to assist in the making of models, static or flying, and in the creation of aircraft for use in the various flight simulator programmes.For what it is, a compilation of aircraft photographs, it is an excellent buy. For what I was hoping for, it leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Flipp - self-titled (Hollywood Records),"What ever happened to this novelty-grunge band? I remember this self-titled CD by Flipp - aren't they the band that wanted to release this CD with a Who cover of a sedate version of ""My Generation"" and Pete Townsend flatly refused to give them permission to even release it? Believe they played the song during their live sets just to spite Townsend. Tunes here I found most inspiring were ""I Wish I Was A Planet"", ""Another Boring Day"", ""Schizo Boy"", ""Slag"" and the rocking ""Half A Brain"". Line-up: Rynn Arens-guitar & vocals, Freaky Useless-bass, Bennett Salvey-organ and Kilo Bale-drums. To picture what Flipp is like onstage, try to imagine Cheap Trick on a off-night with Johnny Rotten as the guest frontman. Sounds smashing, doesn't it? Might appeal to fans of Less Than Jakes, Groovie Ghoulies and Johhny Socko."
2,Disappointing...,Perhaps I've heard it all before or maybe he is too reliant on Lap top computers to get him through the next album but there is nothing new here.. No where near as ground breaking as other albums. But then again he churns them out like hamburgers at McDonalds. Buying them all starts to get stupid after awhile. Chickens and sheep mixed into the usual sonic shriek. Been there done that.
1,"Don't waste your time - a bore, confusing & unbelievable",Barely could finish the book because it was written so badly. Character development is a zero. Story line jumps all over and just isn't developed. Pick almost anything and it'll be better.
5,Great Great CD!!,"This is a CLASSIC!! A must have for Lennon fans. My personal favorites are Jealous Guy by Collective Soul and Cold Turkey by Cheap Trick, although all are excellent! The blokes who gave this CD a bum review don't know what John's music is all about. Buy it!!"
4,My Life: The Presidential Years Vol. II (Vintage),"As a fan of Bill Clinton, I enjoyed this book about the political workings that happen in the back ground."
1,Don't be tempted by the price...,"I like Coby electronics but this mp3 player really bad. The screen is really small and pretty much useless and it is crooked inside the player. The plastic construction is very cheap and will scratch easily, battery life is bad and there is a reason that there is a reset button on the back, it WILL freeze up a lot. Sound quality was actually decent I just wished they could have made the whole thing a lot more durable."
4,Nice brush,This is a nice silicone brush. It can hold the sauce and can be put in the dishwasher it you want.
5,A Must Read for the struggling Christian,"""This is a book you devour from cover to cover, and pass on to others. This is a book you will quote in your daily conversation. Storm was meant to write it and we were meant to read it.""This is Anne Rice's forward and is the absolute truth.After reading this book, I found the things that Howard Storm claims Jesus said to him, to be totally in accordance with scriptures as well as very true to what I have been feeling in my own heart. It made me realize that we all have our path to God and they may not all be the same. That path is wider than a fundamental approach would have us believe.I can't really explain this, but you must read this book. It has brought me back to my church. No church is perfect, learn as much truth as you can from the Bible and your teachers, then let your heart be your guide. This book can help show you how."
5,Great book for a good price!,"I really enjoy this book! I plan on keeping it forever! Amazon was the only place I could find it because it is out of print. The used copy was what I expected. I paid $13 something for it. It did have some highlighting of random passages and a crease on the cover, but was well worth it overall. It is incredible all the environmental stories and essays this book has! It introduced me to some writers I have never heard of that I really enjoy! A must for nature lovers!"
5,Excellent Retractable Leash,"I read the reviews and hoped that since the positives seemed to outnumber the negatives, this would be a quality product. I purchased both a small and a medium Flexi. This review applies to both. It is in comparison to a Pet store purchased retractable leash.PROS:The retractable action feels solid and works smoothly.The plastic feels high quality, thick and heavy duty.The webbing portion is plenty long enough to be able to keep the cord fully retracted and still hold your arm comfortably at your side while walking, with your dog at your side. But not so long, that your dog can run circles around you ;-)Made in Germany printed on the leash and the box. If it was made in USA it would be perfect, but I'll take Germany over China any day.Is not cheap plastic that breaks apart when your dog breaks free to chase a squirrel and drags the leash over concrete and through the woods. (like the store purchased pet store brand did)CONS:I cannot think of any."
5,Best option I tried so far,"This is a very good leash: strong, practical, easy to operate (big buttons), safe (has reflective details).I prefer this one over the shorter version (16 ft) because it gives more freedom for my dog to wander around in places where he can't (unfortunately) be unleashed. I use the leash with a 22 lbs Lhasa Apso and am very satisfied. The only downside is that it's a little bit heavier than the shorter version - nothing that bothers tough."
5,dog owner,"Flexi Large Retractable 26-Foot Classic Long 3 Tape Leash, BlackI have used the Flexi Large tape Leash for many years, since the tape leash became available. We live in the country and you never know what kind of varment might catch our dogs eye while on our walks. The tape leash is stronger than the cord leash and provides a safe way to walk our dogs; while the 26' allows them room to explore and do their business."
1,Not as good at the cord leash,I had the Flexi Large Cord leash for 4 1/2 years before having to replace it when it stopped retracting. The cord never frayed regardless of what it rubbed against. I purchased a new Flexi Large Tape leash for my dog and it lasted 4 months before the tape leash started to fray. I would not recommend this product to anyone else.
5,Michael Jackson's Alter-Ego Biographical story.,This movie is actually supposed to show you what Michael Jackson's life would've been like if he was REALLY White.
1,hmmmm,"haven't seen this movie, and don't intend to. a movie about a special boy who is misunderstood and has super powers written and directed by a convicted child molester just doesn't appeal to me in the slightest. It was rated as one of the top ten worst movies of the year it was released, I will rely on that."
3,It's OK,"The movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I could see where the jokes were but most of them weren't funny. Mike Ditka is the best part of the movie, he played himself perfectly. The parts where the kids played soccer was pretty good but the overall film was OK."
5,will ferrell is hilarious,This moive is so hilarious. I can not stop laughing will ferrell and robert duvall. are the best phil weton (ferrel)starts to coachs his sons team. phil macks a bet with his dad (duvall) you will have to buy the dvd. to find out what the bet.
2,Liver cleanse,I did not have good results with this item. I took it for about a month and really didn't see any difference in the way I felt. I felt sluggish while taking it and it never got any better.C Lotridge
3,concerned,"Hi,I have been taking this product for about 6 months now and decided to do some research of the ingrediants. Black nightshade (whole plant) is one of the herbs in the liver care.It is believed to be very toxic in the body. Does anyone have any info on this that takes this product?"
1,Did Nothing for Me,I had blood tests taken and my AST & ALT (liver enzymes) levels were high. I ordered LiverCare and began taking it as instructed. I was also taking Milk Thistle as per the instructions. I was taking these for approximately 45 days when I had my follow up blood test. My results actually got WORSE. I will continue to take LiverCare until my next follow up (or the bottle runs out) and update my review then.
3,um i have no idea,"I have no idea if this was working or not, i didnt feel any different but if the price is right why not?"
5,It's real deal,I have tried so many liver support products with no success.This product works like a gem. I could feel the effect within 20 minutes taking this capsule. My suggestion is to start with one a day and increase to 2 a day after 1 to two weeks time.
4,Very popular in my country.,"This item is quite popular in India and is a good source of liver protection, Its encouraging to note that westerners have taken onto this. but there are a few things you must be aware of1. This is not an instant cure or even a cure for that matter, don't be disappointed if you do not get quick time results, this takes time.2. Continuing your lifestyle of alcohol and red meat and hoping this would act as a protection will completely reduce this to a placebo effect. You must not have alcohol and no red meat for the course of these tablets (knowing that most westerners cannot live on a vegetarian diet, i recommend you stick with fish and at best chicken). You must eat at least one fruit a day or a glass of fresh juice in lieu thereof, preferably for a month following the course of these tablets.If you do these , the enzymes level will naturally come down which will be well aided by these capsules.Good health!"
4,"If you love the radio program, you'll like this.","I'm a huge fan of Keillor's Wobegon radio stuff, and the stories here were mostly as good as the ones on the radio. But it loses a little not being read by him. His voice is so good and his story-telling so engaging, I missed that a little. But being familiar with his voice, I could ""hear"" him reading it anyway."
3,Packaging issues,"My experience with these cashews is similar to all other reviews.. thought i'd be lucky and not have problems but two of the containers arrives with the seals broken. Some of the cashews had come out into the packaging box (the six containers are sealed again within a larger box, not the amazon shipping box). I decided to keep them because they looked so good. So far i've only eaten one of the open ones and while they are very tasty, you can tell they aren't as fresh as if they had been sealed. Not sure if i'll buy again simply because i'm not happy with the packaging."
5,A glimpse at some hidden knowledge of Prydain,This book contains few short stories that go more in depth into some of the stories of Prydain. The story of Eilonwy's parents and Dallben's story were especially enjoyable. I would recommend this to those that have called Prydain home at one time or another.
4,The story is fun and moving--a must for adventure lovers,"The High King was an excellent way to wrap up Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles. The novel is a fantastic adventure and mystical drama combined with a sweet touch of romance. The most phenomenal feature is how the story depicted the value of true friendship. This is seen in the presence of the selfless farmer, Coll, who proved to be a great asset to the comrades in a time of great danger. The storyline is entertaining and moving, and it will hold you in suspense until the end."
2,BEFORE THE BIRTH OF TARAN WANDERER,"Fans of The Book of Three--rejoice! Alexander presents us with 6 short stories set in Prydain (part Wales, part Middle Earth), before the actual triolgy begins. We pre-meet some old friends, which is always fun. Some of the tales are grim while others are whimsical, but all are woven with Alexander's skillful charm into a tapestry of myth, sorcery and dreams of valor.As the author explains: ""Popular demand makes a splendid pretext for a writer to do what he always wanted to do in the first place...inspired by Welsh legend..."" A delightful read for friends of Taran and Co.-- an excellent introduction to children of all ages who have yet to meet The Friends."
3,"Moderately interesting, particularly for Hornblower fans","This was a moderately interesting real-life account of a British sea captain contemporaneous with the Hornblower books. As such, it makes for an interesting comparison between fact and fiction, and, as the author says, sometimes the former is even more extraordinary than the latter.The author doesn't fully prove his case that Hornblower was based on Gordon, though there are some striking parallels. The most notable one is that Gordon came up the Chesapeake as a commodore with a small fleet very similar to the one that Hornblower led into the Baltic. (What the author finds suspicious is that Forester wrote a naval history of this period that glosses over this incident, perhaps due to the similarities with Hornblower.) The author uses footnotes and an introduction to point out other points of commonality.As I said, moderately interesting, particularly to a Hornblower reader, but not particularly a page-turner."
4,Not Bad,"Pretty good collection of Trojan dubs.(Amazon take note: you seem to be only offering CD #2. Where is#1?)The only quibbles I have with these two CDs are:I would have preferred more vocal-free tracks.As is, about half the selections on both CDs are vocal-free andexcellent. Laswell shows good judgment, for example, in selectingtracks like Throne of Blood and Fist of Fury.My other slight problem: Those familiar with the original Trojan tracks might wonder...where is Laswell's presence? On the Bob Marley CD (Songs of Freedom) Laswell's touch is very evident...but on these CDs...you have to wonder: what did he do besides just select tracks?However, if you program for the vocal-free tracks on both CDs,it's a nice little dub excursion."
4,Good stuff,"Ok, it's expensive. However, it smells great, makes my scalp tingle, and my hair feels great and looks healthier. I'm trying to grow my hair out and read an article about how a certain celeb uses this shampoo (I'm embarrassed to admit that I went off a celeb endorsement). I use it sparingly because it is so expensive, it's safe for my color treated hair and not tested on animals. If you can stomach the price, it's good stuff. I will probably reward myself with the Peter Lamas olive oil conditioner, it's also not cheap."
1,HORRIBLE VOL. 2 ...,More of the same hokey muzak kind of cd with just awful sax playing by alleged musicians who did well to remain anonymous.
1,Hans Zimmer is the worst film writer ever,"This music is not stirring, evocative or powerful. It is trite, banal and unimaginative. The whole style derives from a frankly naive grasp of classical harmony/orchestration and sets a new benchmark for film compositional mediocrity. John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith and Bernard Hermann proved that film music does not have to be simplistic for ordinary people to be moved by it. I don't understand why Zimmer's abysmal score writing (perfectly exemplified in this movie) is indulged at all."
4,A glimpse into their awesome chemistry!,"I regularly go the Blue Note here in NYC and got the chance to see Michel Camilo live on this one night. I didn't expect to see what I saw! I've always known how awesome a pianist Michel Camilo is but when I saw Tomatito, I was in awe of Tomatito's technique. I was about 10 feet away from him and I couldn't figure out how he was getting all those beautiful sounds. I was so anxious to get the CD but everywhere I turned to didn't have it. When I got it, I was a little disappointed. Just a little... When I saw them live, THEY WERE 10 TIMES BETTER THAN ON THE CD, if you can imagine that! The CD doesn't do them justice but it comes pretty close."
1,BEWARE OF FALSE IMITATIONS,"KRAPOLA!BUYER BEWARE, THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK RECORDING TO THE VERY COOL MOVIE BY THE SAME NAME.I FOUND OUT TO LATE BEFORE I COULD CANCEL THE ORDER.DON'T BE FOOLED !"
2,"Good for pre '85, Poor for 87-89","I actually felt ripped off. The book is advertised as '65-'89, it should be -'85. The system I was looking for wasn't even in the book! It mentions later models as generalizations and too many things are missing for the mentioned years. If you have a pre '85, get it, if not: forget it!"
3,Its another Haynes manual,"The manual required a lot of photos to do the works and a lt of photos are missing, no sequens"
1,OVERPRICED AT $1,This book is useless. The photos are very poor quality and do not show enough to be usefull. Get the factory manuals or one of the other 911 books. There is insufficient information to sucessfully complete any serious engine work. For that matter I don't beleive I could do a tune up given the information in this book.
1,Useless,"I bought this book with the hope I could perform some of the maintainence on my 911. I was not familiar with the 911, but I had done many repairs on previous cars such as a tune up, replacing an alternator, starter, power steering pump, and master cylinder. This book doesn't give enough information to do any of the above. Buy the factory workshop manuals if you want to work on your 911. They are expensive, but worth it."
1,Cheap quality...,"You'll be better off, looking at you local Wal-mart, because this was very cheap for the amount I payed for it..."
3,Only hardcore Lady Death fans will want to collect this...,"I wasn't completely stunned with the movie. They could have done certain things with it. But overall, this movie just lacked what I wanted of a Lady Death movie. I only got this movie just to see what it was about & for it to go with my Lady Death collection.Sadly I am disappointed with this movie. The animation wasn't what it was cracked up to be. I would only recommend this if you're a hardcore collector of Lady Death. But rather than unwrapping it and seeing this movie, keep it sealed. It's not that great."
1,the worst of the worst,"the box art is fantastic... but the film blows... my friend got this DVD for free at best buy.... gee i wonder why it was free.... it sucked.... it is disguised as an anime with frickin awesome box art but it is trash in disguise.... countless attacks to christianity and all things sacred in anime... like good graphics, voices, and a story line.with names like cremator it totally blows.... lol..... not even worth getting as a free copy.... we caved half way through and put in something else.... full metal panic was a better thing to watch on halloween.the company that put out the animation is like korean or something.... well any how it is definately not anime.... and it really sucked.... you will benefit better by cleaning your closet than watching this film."
1,Ughhh,"I just wanted to add to everyone else, and say that this movie sucked if your a fan of the comic or just someone who like more adult animation please skip this movie. The animation is terrible, and the voice acting is craptastic. When the devil is speaking you cant even hear what he is saying. The audio on his voice is way lower then the rest of the cast. The frame rate on the animation is so pore that sometimes the characters look like they are moving in slow motion. I am a fan of the comic and I can say that this movie diserves a 1 out of 5."
2,Hell Hath No Fury . . .,"Director Andy Orjuela drags us to Hell, where the Devil's minions rebel and bikinis are the only protective gear you get. Based on the comic by Brian Pulido (who co-wrote the script), the film centers on the daughter of a Swedish warlord--actually Lucifer in disguise--who challenges her father after taking the rap for his rampage on Earth. One of the movie's selling points (besides the obvious) is the solid plot that it could've had. But Lady Death spends so much time sword-sparring, sleeping, and dragging around severed heads, that it makes her hour-and-a-half run feel much longer. Add to that the stiff animation and endless bloodshed and by the film's climax, you just stop caring. It feels like you've lost years of your life, and that's how I'll remember this.This film contains graphic violence and is recommended for mature audiences only."
1,A Documentary is anything,This is more of a documentary than a movie. Its like a really really really bad version of Spring Break Videos. remind of of E!'s Wildon episodes with out the fun stuff ha
2,"Definitely gay fiction, and a very slow read.","An entire tribe of gay men? And all so the author could have one gay man in love with the hero? Please, things don't have to be real, but they have to be realistic, and that just isn't. The rest of the story is ok, but slooooooooow."
2,No the Docs best,"Ususally the Doc Smith books are bad science, good fiction. And I REALLY wanted to like this book, as I think of myself as a fan of pulp sci-fi... But this was just SO bad I couldnt find anything redeeming about it. The science was of course badly dated, and embellished badly, even for the time it was written in. The fiction was wooden and uninteresting. The dialogue was so over wrought with gitchy dated phrasing as to make you reread some parts to figure WTF he was talking about. OH! And I think I got my fill of ""All X"" (or some minor variant) by page 50, but it didnt keep it from showing up 3 times a page till the end. This was so bad I found myself skimming and just trying to get it over with. Unless you are a hardcore completist, and E.E. ""Doc"" Smith has gotten on your radar or authors to read everything of, go ahead and skip this."
5,Great Movie,Great movie about the USA's first soccer team in the Olympics. I don't know how accurate the historical aspects of the movie are because I didn't know of this little bit of history until we got this movie.
4,The Miracle Match,"Excellent, heartwarming story of underdogs doing the impossible. Sorry I missed it when it first came out a few years ago."
3,"Good, but could have been better","I think that all the leads did a great job, but the problem with this movie was in the final game. Unfortunately, the practice games that they showed throughout the movie were more exciting than the big game with England. I think the movie did a good job in relating the state of soccer in this country at that time. Also the friction between the East coast and St. Louis players, and then the ultimate bonding that created a good team. Worth seeing."
2,Rehashville,This is a rehash of the comedy tour movie...most of the material is identical. It doesn't even have the extras the movie had. Bill's set was almost exactly the same as the movie. Buy the movie and the 3rd DVD. This was just a way to make some extra bucks off suckers like me!
2,Only for people not familiar with these artists,I was SO looking forward to this DVD's release. I'm very disappointed.The material from Bill Engvall and Ron White is all on other albums and DVDs from them as individual comics. The Jeff Foxworthy seemed to be new though. I'm not familiar enough with Larry the Cable Guy's work to know if his was new.And the end is much shorter and not nearly as funny as the group work they did at the end of the first BCC show.
3,Not Good At All,"Nothing Compared TO The FIrst. Only Act Worth Watching WAs Larry ""Git r done"" The Cable Guy.Ron was to much of his old stuff.Bill was just not funny.Jeff seemed like He didnt wanna be there as he has performed better.Not Worth the buy. May wanna put this on your rental list."
4,"Dosen't shine like the first one, but still good for a laugh","Not NEARLY as good as the first one. But still good for a few hearty chuckles. The opening in the tour bus was the funniest ( to me) I was hoping that remote control fart machine would once again come into play, as that was without a doubt, the funniest part of the whole first film.Ron White was kind of lackluster this time, but Larry the Cable guy REALLY shined. Jeff foxworthy and bill engvall were VERY funny, but not up to their full comic potential.All in all, a must-see.Definately worth $13 bucks."
5,Wonderful panties,"I loved the panties. I can't stand those that don't come up to your waist or fall down over your hips. These are lovely, feel great and fit great. Thank you."
5,WOW - What A deal,"Arrived super quick and is much better than I could have imagined. It is one of the best deals, for the money, I have ever purchased. Priced right, works great, good looking, durable. highly recommend this lamp with table attached."
5,I love this book!!!,This book is great because it has candid photos of Grace Kelly just doing what any normal person would do. Like fixing a sandwich. This book is a wonderful picture book of her life.
5,"Compact, versatile--worked great in Europe and in China!","We bought the APC Universal Plug Adapter last year when we went on a Europe tour, and it worked perfectly in Holland, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, and England, letting us plug our (110/220 switchable) devices into the wall outlet--especially the cell phone and digital camera battery chargers and the iPod charger. It's very compact. THe only challenge is to figure out which ""Transformers""-like way to arrange the parts to get the one that fits the outlet you're looking at.We liked this so much we bought one as a gift for a friend going to India, and he said it worked great there too, so we recommended it to my brother as he headed out with his family last month for a tour of Europe. And then we took it to China last month and it worked perfectly in Hong Kong, Taishan, and Gwonghou (Canton).Completely recommended!"
3,Don't Pretzel My Buttons,"This is a really nice color, a light beige with hints of peach or tan depending on the light. If you have very fair skin, it won't give you much contrast. I have a hard time with brushstrokes showing: I have to apply thickly in order to get a smooth coat."
5,Soft Leather Gloves,I bought these gloves for myself. The leather is SO soft and pliable. They're very attractive. The cashmere lining is very nice & soft. A tag was left on them from Saks 5 Avenue with their price. Oh my!! I got a good deal from Amazon. The seller's sizing chart is very accurate. These gloves fit me perfectly. I'm very happy!
5,Whats the diff?,Whats the difference between the batman beyond the movie and return of the joker two packs. One is $14 the other $17. They both look like they include the same items. Does one of them include the return of the joker uncut version? If so which one the $14 or $17?
2,Not a hardcover,I just received my copy today and it is a paperback book. The receipt and the listing on Amazon shows that it is a hardcover book. The price of $35.99 seems a bit steep for a 200 page paperback book. Just know before you buy it that it is not a hardcover book.
5,Does not run under Vista or System 7,"This is an old product that has needed updating for many years. It does have a clunky interface and needs a complete system overhaul. Nevertheless it is fairly easy to use and has a great selection of titles (all out of copyright, of course) and a limited search capability that is very useful when doing research in literature, history, religious works, etc. It needs to be revised so it will run under System 7 and Vista. I can't run it on my new computer and have kept an older one around just to use it. My alternative is to copy the books I really want to Word or some other text processor and save them that way as individual files. This would lose the search function, however, and is only a partial solution. XP Mode on System 7 is viable until 2014 when Microsoft support for XP goes away so don't expect XP to be in the next MS operating system."
4,In Response to the offended guy,"To understand Beenie Man and his music you have to understand the Jamaican culture. Homosexuality is seriously frowned upon by Jamaicans I know because my Family is Jamaican and I was taught that same notion. I am not saying that it is ok for people to murder others due to their prejudices, but he has the right to speak whatever he feels the same way that you have the right to express what it is that you feel. So FYI if you dont understand the music or the culture then just leave it alone!"
4,It keeps you on the edge of your seat,This was really a great mystery! The Characters were strong and suspenseful. Its has a really great plot. It made me thankful I'm not married or have I ever had to bear a child. If your pregnant you might not want to read this till you've had the baby. Thomas Altman has a very unique writing style its a shame he doesn't write anymore. He could have been the next Stephen King I like him better than Dean Koontz. I was worried that it was old enough that it might be outdated. But it certainly wasn't Whoever reads this book is in for a roller coaster ride from start to finish.
5,FUN,"I enjoyed The Wedding as much as her previous book, The Bride. The perky humor reminds me a lot of Elizabeth Peters and her books with the character Amelia Peabody"
4,"Enjoyed the book, but the audio is very disappointing!","I have never chuckled so much in reading a historical romance as I did with this book. I thought the nuiances were great, and the verbal banter entertaining. I was so excited about it, that I bought the audio. I was looking forward to an enjoyable commute to work. How disappointing the audio was. Though not advertised as abridged, when the tape arrived it was obvious that three hours meant abridged. In the tiny print, it was confirmed. Having an open mind, I began the tape. All of the little things that made this book so special were deleted. I can't imagine that Ms. Garwood approved. Buy the book. Don't waste your money on the audio!"
3,"Okay -- but way too ""modern"" dialogue","After reading Honor's Splendor, I thought I would try a few other Garwood romances. This one is okay, however, the hero and heroine talk to each other in ways, and using expressions that are way too modern. It requires too much suspension of belief that the heroine in the middle ages would tell her husband, ""we need to start over,"" talking about their relationship. Also, the hero is almost a caricature -- he is too manly, savage, whatever. So, three stars for being a little entertaining, but really not worth the 8 bucks."
4,4 1/2 stars for the humor and everything else that's garwood,"first off, connor is the least hero that i like in garwood's historical. besides having a low sense of humor, he has hardly shown that usual unconscious affection towards his lady love that garwood grants her chieftain/warrior/delicious-to-the-kilt characters. more often than not, he is rude and sometimes even indifferent to brenna.brenna, fortunately, is a very likeable heroine. her idiosyncrasies are so adorable.but what i really loved about this story was, of course, as the title says, THE wedding. that was simply an outright joy to read. the way the priest managed to bless not just the couple but the other warriors as well since brenna was walking in circles around him was hilarious.the other scene i could never forget was little grace's confession to alec. now that was a kid for you. she was absolutely adorable when she replied, ""i love you, papa,"" when asked by alec what really happened between jamie and brenna...lol..."
5,An Absolutely Fantastic Novel,"This novel is great. I could not put it down. I laughed with the main characters, I cried with the main characters. The novel is funny, emotional and I fell in love with all the characters. I have read this book twice and it just seems to get better and better."
2,Great for insomniacs!,"I bought this after reading the glowing reviews - I'm afraid I was disappointed. I'm sure it is through and would teach me German - if it didn't send me to sleep first! I'm not sure driving and listening to this at the same time should be allowed. All you hear is very dry and emotionless voices repeating words - a man says the English, then a woman repeats the German word twice. No hints on pronunciation, no cultural advice, no music, no enthusiasm, *nothing* except these two voices. You also need to listen to the tapes over and over again before you start to learn the words. However, I'm sure this would appeal to some people, and it is very through. Personally, I need a little more enthusiasm and joy in my life!"
5,Greatest Mix tape of the year,When I first poped it in I was like why would the DOC do such a thing. Most fans want a whole album. Then you listen to all the hits and find out that this mix tape in not like most. The production on this more like something you would expect for him on DefJam. I see Dead People is a true classic and Vol 2 should be just a great a CD.
3,Redman needs a new album. This dont satisfy the hunger.,"This ""mixtape"" is not enough for us real redman fans. Where is a new album from the funk doc. He should at least do another project wit meth."
1,fun..but not at all like utah,"As a non-Mormon who lives and works in Salt Lake City, this book does have a few humorous spots. But, on the whole, it is dull and predictable."
3,Smell like kerosene,"I order a supply of shop-vac filters every year or so. The last order had a strong kerosene odor. Glad the filters stay in the box which is in the garage! I gave this product a 3 star rating due to the strong kerosene odor. I do like using the vac to clean up messy jobs like dust after remodeling projects, especially the dust left behind from sanding sheetrock."
2,"""Wrinkles"" if rinsed",This filter is advertised as wet and dry with minimal wet pickup. What they did not say is that this paper filter will wrinkle if you vaccum wet places. I do not expect this filter to last much as it quickly wears out everytime you rinse it.
3,vac,"Whats to say? it came on time, it fits my vac, its a back up filter for when the original get clogged"
5,Good stuff.,"Very good quality filter....I use this to vacuum out our wood-stove, and it has held up very well. It still works, even after it is clogged. If you blow it out, or throw it around outside, you can re-use it over-and-over."
5,filtro,Buen producto. Es original y no tengo niguna queja. Cumple con las condiciones para lo que fue hecho y no hay ningun reproche de mi parte
1,This filter is junk,"Filtered OK when dry. When I tried to rinse it, it disintegrated. The paper just seemed to dissolve. Very disappointed especially considering it is a name brand. I will not buy this filter again. To replace it, I bought a shop vac ""ultra web."" More expensive, but it seems a lot sturdier. We'll see how it holds up."
5,Dope Beats and more,"This is the long awaited CD by Ge-ology himself. The CD is tight, there are many joints on here I've heard before, but it's refreshing to hear the two songs by Vinia....Overall I give the CD 5 stars for it's ability to head your head nodding in the car esp. if you are driving a long distance. Highly reccomend."
5,A user friendly book,"This is a really nice book, to get you started in wine appreciation.I also bought a Perfect Sommelier, because I wanted to taste the wine as soon as I bought it, instead of waiting years for it to be cellared. Use Google to search for it.The book really helped in locating some of the many varieties of wine that are available today. I love the 'Dummy' book too!"
5,Dark humor with a smart commentary,"This is more than a comedy; it has something for everyone, especially those who like to see certain sacred cows get poked. What are the sacred cows? Our wonderful government, our media, the sci-fi genre itself, filmmakers with big heads. Also I liked this movie because the people making the movie within the movie may be jackass obsessives but I love them for their heart. They're pursuing their dream, doing what they love. I really grooved on the Soul Coughing music on the end credits.Ray Wise is a standout; he can't do anything wrong. Good movie! Lots of laughs."
4,Mike Always Made Me Laugh More Than Joel...,"... and that's why I was surprised to see Mike after buying what I thought was a Joel episode. It's funny as hell (as usual), and Mike is a little funnier to take than Joel. Mike always puts on a kinda ""confused with his surroundings"" attitude. He comments on the movies because he feels the whole situation is bizar. Joel just has an attitude like instead of breathing oxygen up in space he's breathing weed 24/7."
4,"Quite Funny and ""I'm Peter Graves.""","I discovered MST3K late and got hooked on it and then it was cancelled. So, I have started my DVD collection of the episodes. ""Beginning of the End"" is a very good one to start with.The DVD contains the MST3K version and the original, uncut version. That is very nice to have. The picture is clear and there are no problems with the disk at all. There aren't many extra's, but I wouldn't expect many for a TV show on DVD.The episode is quite fun to watch. There are many funny comments and events that happen on the film. The first major grasshopper is excellent. Despite being a ""cheesy"" movie, the acting is not bad, compared to other films in the MST3K series. The ""in between"" skits are also quite good. The movie script for the life story of ""Peter Graves"" is absolutely side splitting.I have several other episodes on DVD. If you are just getting started, start with this one."
1,Wrong Size for Z730!!!!!,"The adapter advertised to fit the Z730 does not. However, I did get another free adapter for some 52 mm close up lenses that does fit onto the camera at 39.2 mm. After careful review and looking closely at the adapter for the DX7440 which looks in the picture to go from 39.2 to 37 mm I ordered it and hopefully it will fit. Amazon needs to correct this error.Tad"
1,Wrong item received,"The lens adapter I received was the wrong size for the Z730 camera. I needed 37mm screw, according to the Kodak site, but the one received was much smaller. However, it was wrongly identified as fitting the Z730."
2,Based On Item Number.....,"If you check out the Kodak site, this item, Item model number: 1919125is the number they have listed for the Z760 Model. I rated it as 2 stars because it is unaval, and just what I need."
2,Why I returned my purchase.,I was not aware that this product was a 33 1/3 long play vynal disc. I thought it was a CD. Was there any indication on the site that it was what it turned out to be? Or should I have known by the presentation of the picture of the product.
4,Timber log jack,I haven't used the product yet but it seems to meet my expectations. The original shipment was missing several key parts but a call to the shipping source was sucessful in a reshipment and a complete product. Everything was done on a timely basis.
4,Pretty good read!,Like mysteries and crime books. Liked the 'twists and turns' in Night Vision. Have bought additional Levine works to read.
4,Very Amusing,"I love Paul Levine's books, especially this one and his first novel. Witty, opinionated in a funny yet relevant way, and has a good plot too! Try this book!"
1,Don't buy this product,"My mom bought a copy of this game for my nephew's birthday. We have not been able to run it and there are two VERY computer literate people in the family (not that installing software is very difficult these days). When you install it, it says a file is missing. We can't find the file on the disk. We e-mailed the company over a month ago and have not gotten a response. We have tried to call the 800 number many times and there is no answer EVER. Do not buy this product unless you want to spend $34. for nothing."
2,totally 80's infected,"alright, I'm a total Roy fan, however I was thoroughly dissapointed with this performance. For some reason the band felt the need to ""modernize"" all his classic songs, which resulted in 80's bastardizations of all his classic's. All the songs are altered to different tempo's to accomidate a different era, which I felt is ""oh so wrong""."
2,Good Show... Terrible Transfer,"I love Roy Orbison. This show sounded very good. However, Image Entertainment didn't properly transfer this video. Often times, you see color separation in the video and it looks very primative. Yes, it is a very old video but New West Records has done a much better with Austin City Limits transfers delivering superior sound and picture quality. It looks like Image Entertainment didn't work on this dvd at all. What a shame."
3,"Humorous, yet questionable","The content of Do Fish Drink Water? is largely quite entertaining, though its accuracy can oft be debated. Such references as the ""osmosis of saltwater"" (osmosis is singularly the diffusion of water, not salt) and other possibly incorrect conclusions detract from an otherwise amusing compilation of unusual questions and their answers."
4,Rock has a name: fastball,"This cd has a serious rock edge that only briefly surfaces in their later ""All the Pain Money can Buy."" And yet, with guitars blazing and drums booming, Miles and Tony combine to give us perfect harmonies and thougthful lyrics. A clue to the more refined pop that gives this band their power: ""Are you ready for the fallout"" both bitter and compassionate at the same time. I thought of Elvis Costello when I first heard it. This record is the power of fastball in its purest form. Please, no stage diving, these are musicians at work."
4,"Not ""Fastbally""","For those of you who were introduced to Fastball with their one-hit wonder, ""The Way,"" you may not like this album. This was released prior to them becoming famous, and they were more rock. There are some songs that are slower, but for the most part you're getting fast guitars and upbeat drums."
3,NOT the Ricky Jay one,"For all the Magic Dorks out there looking for the ""Story of Magic"" special that aired on A&E back in the 90s narrated by Ricky Jay; THIS IS'NT IT. Its a nice special and has a GREAT interview with Todd Robbins but it just happens to have the same misleading title as the A&E special"
4,Stethoscope,"This is a great little stethoscope. Gets the job done. Not to big or small, it is just the right size for my needs."
5,The only Queen set you'll need,This is the best collection of Queen hits. They are one of the most creative bands of all time. Their singles hold up well over time.
3,What's the difference between this and Classic Queen/Greatest Hits?,I'll tell you. 12 songs (six on each set). So it comes down to what you like. I'll take these six songs from Classic Queen:1. Stone Cold Crazy2. One Year of Love3. Tie Your Mother Down4. These are the Days of Our Lives5. Keep Yourself Alive6. Body Languageover these six songs from Greatest Hits I and II any day of the week:1. Flash2. Innuendo3. It's a Hard Life4. Breakthru5. The Invisible Man6. Friends Will be FriendsAny questions?
4,Great,"This hits album is of the highest standard shore its not Johnny Soper but what is, from Bohemium Rapsody to We Are The Champions onto the other side Radio Ga Ga it is pure genius, so many songs that will be remembered for years after the enevitable."
4,Essential Queen!,"Ya know ya gotta have it! All the best, all the faves, all the chart-toppers, all the sweetest sides from Queen's long reign. But for the loss of Freddie Mercury, they'd be cranking out more even today.This is a must-have for the die-hard Queen fan, an education for the casual listener and a fabulous introduction to the newcomer. If your exposure to this world-class band is limited to ""Wayne's World"" and a Mountain Dew ad, you NEED this album!"
5,Listen to it constantly!,I got this for my husband's birthday and we have been listening to it for the last month! I am glad I read the reviews and bought the 2 disk Best Of Queen and not the 3 disk version since many people thought the 3rd disk was not good. Since I bought the 2 disk one we are not dissapointed with any of our purchase.
3,Very late in arriving.,"Terrible custormer service. Would NOT use vendor again or recommend to others. However, music is fabulous."
2,Not a good compilation at all... Too many single edits!,"When you plan to make a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation for such a quintessential rock band as Queen, you can do it right if you include ONLY original, FULL-LENGTH versions! This 2-CD is filled with ""Singles""!!! Instead of it, save some extra money and get the whole Queen album collection... Being the case of this unparalleled Rock band, it is worth the price!"
4,"""i'm just a girl without apology, to you i am diseased""","i'd have to say, if i wasn't already in love with jack off jill, human waste project would take the third slot in my list of favorite bands. but they're right up there. my best friend spent a while urging me to download some of their stuff, but i procrastinated. eventually i got around to it, and the first song i heard was dog and i was blown away. the vocals are so powerful, and the lyrics are so raw. they're one of those bands that i absolutely love but no one's heard of them and they never get any attention. but they really are fantastic. if you listen to them and like them check of kidney thieves, jack off jill, the gathering, possibly my ruin and hole. if you like any of those bands check out this one. you get it. they're great."
5,easy and authentic,"Having lived in Afghanistan many,many years ago this book was a great way to fulfill my nostalgic yearnings. I've often thought of Afghan food as the ultimate ""comfort"" food, but since I had a cook while I lived in Kabul, I never personally prepared any Afghan dishes. I do however, know when something tastes ""right"" and everything I've tried from this book has hit the mark so far. Tashakor, Helen!"
2,Disappointed,"Reading all of these favorable reviews, I bought this book and couldn't wait to try out the recipes. The first one I tried making was the chicken kebabs which came out tasteless. I love Afghani rice, it is so flavorful so I tried the basic pilau recipe which came out bland and undercooked even though I followed the directions exactly. I am not encouraged to try out the other recipes after such terrible results. I don't think the author has really tested these recipes to make sure the measurements and instructions will produce the intended results. There are no pictures and the format of the book is bound more like a novel than a cookbook making it hard to refer to while cooking."
3,Reproductive harm???,"These look nice, but say on the back that they contain a product known in the state of California that is known to cause cancer and reproductive harm. Not nice when you are putting it on your daughter's bike the night before Christmas morning. Bah humbug.But, she loves them, and she is way past the age where she puts things in her mouth, so I hope we are safe."
1,Sucked,this movie was by far one of the worst i've seen in a long time.don't waste your time or money.
1,You must be kidding !,"The description sounds interesting. Unfortunately that is about all I can say since I am writing this review in 2004. The DVD Release Date is January 1, 2010, or in about 6 years. Why is this even being advertised ? Am I missing the joke ?"
5,Delicious!,"""Carmo, Hit The Road"" simply put, is delicious. Watching the film, you will find yourself seeing, tasting and hearing the experience so acutely, that you will need to watch it again to capture what you may have missed the first time. Mariana Loureiro's portrayal of Carmo, is magnificent as she navigates the edges of her character while giving the audience the privilege of watching her innate gifts as an actress- one who can emote great emotions from within you often without even speaking.My only regret is the lack of the director's cut- I wanted to hear the back-story of how the scenes were composed and how the director was able to take the audience to those back roads with such sensuality and artistic humor. From the music to the outstanding visual imagery, it is not surprising the critical acclaim that Sundance followers raved about- a must see."
5,One of the best!!!,"I HAD to give this CD 5 stars since it is one of the VERY FEW cd's I've bought over the past decade where I like every song (one of four actually, the others being AC/DC - Live, Weird Al - Bad Hair Day and Gravity Kills self titled album). I bought it when it first came out and still listen to it today. The songs blend well together and carry the emotion of The Crow legacy with them. I rate this album the best in the series."
3,Why does this have to include rap?,"First album was excellent (except for rage against the machine who I dislike). Heavy rock and alternative was all it gave you. Now we have a similar formula with 2 rap tracks added, my god why. Is it politically correct to add rap to a soundtrack where it has no place; if it is to hell with political correctness. Take off the rap and the album get another star."
3,Bought it for Korn,"Korn's track ""Sean Olson"" on this soundtrack does infact make this compilation buy-worthy. There is also great tracks from Filter, Bush, Deftones and the White Zombie song is so-so, but these are the only 5 songs on this 15 track (clocking in over an hour and 13 minutes) soundtrack that are listen-worthy. Eveything else is pretty gaggy, repetitive, annoying. Hole's cover of ""Gold Dust Woman"" again leaves Hole with the reputation of having one good song in history (""Doll Parts""). We have utterly annoying tracks from P.J. Harvey, Seven Mary Three, Linda Perry, NY Loose (who...?) and Pet. The Iggy Pop live track sounds like crap, to be quite frank. I think this soundtrack was intended to be a diversified compilation of artists, which it is, but is it a GOOD diversified compilation of artists? Well, without our fellow metal acts such as Korn, Deftones, and White Zombie and alternative rockers Bush and Filter you don't even have an album worth looking for in the used cd bins."
1,the parable of the christ,"This movie is a typical liberal feel good view that accentuates the goodness of man, and presents an unrealistic view of man. No dealing with sin or Jesus Christ or the need of forgiveness (by God). I wouldn't recommend this film."
5,Rare Find and Great Listening--Fantastic Beethoven!,"I had this collection on LP's years ago and they finally became unplayable after so much use... It took me 30 years to find this collection on CD. I was overjoyed to find this for such a bargain price. You will not be disappointed with this purchase! Quiet yet intriguing, good study or meditation music. Great for relaxation. Good variety from quiet to vivacious. The interplay between flute and piano is pleasant on the ears and the mind/heart. This collection reproduces the entire contents of the old LP version as I knew it 30 years ago--now with digital sound and the durability of the CD! Chamber Music at it's best--and an awesome Beethoven addition to any classical collection!"
3,Coromega for kids,"Received product quickly. Both my 6 year old son and 5 year old son did not like the taste. I am now finishing off the product and it is not bad tasting to me but it is marketed for kids, so I guess it is not a success in our house.My 6 year old is ADHD, so I am trying to find a high quality fish oil for him. We have been taking Lil Critters Omega 3's for years, but is has a low amount of DHA and EPA which is what you really want in an Omega 3. My kids are now trying Dr. Sears fish oil and kids strawberry & lemon flavor and the kids can take that right off the spoon."
5,No problem,"My 5 year old son has been very picky with other Omega-3 supplements in the past, however he seems to like Coromega."
4,Street Music By An Original,"These recordings are all that exists of street musician Eddie Jones' music. Playing a home made instrument akin to the African diddleybow, Jones' Delta inspired blues sounds primative and authentic. Jones shares this CD with another street musician, Edward Hazelton, who accompanies himself alone on harmonica to interesting effect. If you're wanting something original and authentic, this is about as unique as it gets."
1,Miss Labeled,It is more of a skit than a movie. That isn't the way a psycho responds to seeing people naked in front of him.
3,"Sotos is great, but he's no Bataille","As a sort of cultural compass that points to a very odd magnetic south, Sotos is fairly without peer. His earlier writings are by nature, more vitriolic; this book shows his matured writing style and personally I find it more disturbing than his former ""shock for shock's sake"" style. He's also lost some of the irritating ""serial killer fanboy"" tinge he had. Total Abuse should still be sought out though, to trace the course his writings have taken.When discussing the gray areas that humanity slips into, Sotos is perfect. I love his work, and though I love him, I see him as being closer to de Sade than to Bataille. Nothing wrong with that, however!"
2,Gulpy Pet Water Dispenser,"Terrific product,... convienient and versatile.But, the fold-out drinking vessel will readily break if dropped unto a hard surface, even from a short height. And, it cannot be repaired.I've contacted the manufactor, New Angle Pet Products, and got no response.They should offer replacement vessels, and redesign with a hard rubber material that will take impact,... we are talking dogs here!"
1,Poor execution of a great idea,"This was given to us as a gift and it is conceptually a great product. BUT I have dropped one of them twice and it is now beyond repair and headed for the recycle bin.The bottle doesn't stand up when you set it on a flat surface because the trough is rounded on the end. The belt clip is useless, which is why it dropped on the floor the second time for its final break. (the first time was just my own clumsiness) The plastic of the trough is SO weak, it broke after a drop onto a wood floor from waist-height.I agree - rubberized plastic, or the stuff nalgenes are made of would be the answer to the breaking issue. From now on, I'll just make sure I have a Porta-Bowl clipped to a Nalgene - it holds a lot more anyway."
5,Wonderful Book!!!,This book tugs at the heartstrings and leaves you wondering how something like this could happen. I was able to picture the events as they unfolded and feel the frustration that Dave Holloway must have faced. Some of the events were alarming and it's amazing that the Aruban officials were so blatant in their mishandling of Natalee's disappearance. I recommend this book to anyone who likes true crime. It definitely held my attention.
5,Wake up Call for All Americans,"""Aruba"" This is a well written story that all parents and their teenagers should read and realize that the laws in other countries do not protect or cooperate with Americans. I was amazed that the FBI could not do more to find out what happened to Natalie. This book is an eye-opener for all travellers and my heart goes out to Dave Holloway. I can hardly wait to read Beth Holloway's new book, ""Loving Natalie"" and hope this story stays on top of the news until she is found. Sadly, there is no ending to this journey, but there are lessons to be learned, as there are no fairy tales in this day and age. M. Newton, Los Angeles, Ca."
5,A Stunning Novel,"I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Mr Huggins. Then Iread Rora, and believe me I could not put it down. If there isany way you can obtain a copy, do so. You will be richly rewardedfor having read this brilliant novel."
5,"Great, The Suicide Machines BEST CD.","Horns make this CD great. Battle Hymns was OK, but minus the horns. This CD is a must for music lovers, notably HEY! ( track 5 )"
2,Returned it,"The biggest problem was that it only had two USB ports, and one of them was intermittent/broken on my unit. It also seems to run hotter than most other laptops. The loud fan is almost always on and interferes with audio and recording. I think the heat may lead to early failures and reduced reliability. If you do get this, test it thoroughly in the 30 day guarantee period.Other minor complaints are the heavy weight, and the lack of 802.11 wireless or DVD write features."
5,I love Amazon they are always so helpful the one to go to!,"I had been looking for Christmas stockings to make for my twin grandchildren and as always Amazon found them for me! They are awesome. I always try to look thru them first, they will usually find the item and at the lowest cost!Trish"
4,A good photo paper,"This paper print like what ever othe good cuality photo paper I have tried before.It print exellent and in both printer I have, one is a brothe and the other is an HP, and the cuallity is exellent; so. it make think that this paper is going to woer good with the rest of the printers."
2,Photo Paper,"First time purchasing this photo paper. It is very lightweight paper. The price was great! and you get what you pay for in this instance. If you're wanting a quality photo, I would upgrade to another level. I bought 2 packs (because of the price) and the cost to return was as much as the paper, so I kept both. It will eventually get used up. I'm sure I'll find a use for it, but it won't be for the photos I want to display."
2,Paper is too thin,This photo paper was a bit disappointing. The paper is quite thin and cheap feeling. Not suitable for printing pictures you plan to display or save for a long time. Used a bunch to print some bulk pictures whose use didn't require much quantity but with what ink costs it started to seem like a waste. Can't endorse these for printing up meaningful or important pictures but if you're looking for cheap paper for some purpose I suppose it could have a use.
1,Probably the worst paper for printing pictures,"I bought this paper for my Canon Pixma 4000 bubblejet printer with intention to print cd covers for my band's promo material... What a mistake. The result is so unacceptable - colors are too dark, ink is spilled all over the picture, there are some very noticable gray lines, that for a moment I thought something was wrong with my Canon. Luckily, picture I printed 5 minutes later on Canon Photo Paper was perfect, and led me to one conclusion - HP everyday photo paper is utter rubish. Avoid at all cost."
1,Unusable on Epson Stylus Photo R200/R300/R320/R500/R600,"Even though the package claims that the paper can be used with all printers it works very badly on the Epson printers listed above (I actually tested on the R200, but the others share the same ink and printhead, so the paper is likely to work badly with them as well).On these printers the ink forms little pools and the resulting prints look very grainy."
1,Do not buy this book!!!!,"This book is nothing more then basic System Administration and does not cover any of the Solaris 10 features.Honestly, the book does not represent itself truthfully and should have the title changed or the book pulled, it is very misleading.Save your money!"
1,I don't believe it,"I can not believe that the publishers are still promoting this book. Not only does it NOT cover some of the amazing features of Solaris 10, much of the content relates to earlier releases of Solaris and a number of the features covered no longer exist in Solaris 10.I felt I had completely wasted the money spent on this book. I was appalled at the content and lack of attention to just what Solaris 10 is. Very disppointed."
1,Just awful...,"This is the first time I've ever been motivated to write a bad review. But this book is just awful for Solaris 10. It's not a book on Solaris 10, it's a book on old Solaris. You'd be better off Googling your version 10 issues than reading this book. It will steer you off in the wrong direction. I agree with another user who suggested that the only thing the author did was a search-and-replace on the word Solaris and add a ""10"" to it."
2,Where's SMF?,"I bought this book because it was the most appropriate book on Solaris 10 that I could find at the bookstore. I am a long time Solaris system administrator, but I wanted a book that specifically talked about the new features of Solaris 10.I didn't know about SMF when I bought the book, but it's a pretty important feature that replaced previous methods of system management in Solaris. I just can't believe that this book does not even mention it. I see other people have complained about the same thing.I also noticed that the book did not give a good overview of the installation. I had to go online to look up anything I didn't know about in regards to the install since the book just didn't discuss it.I gave this book a two star rating because it's an okay general Solaris reference book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Not really a Solaris 10 book,"The author does not cover the new features of Solaris 10. He mentions zones in passing, never mentions DTrace, and his information on configuring services using inetd.conf is outdated (no mention anywhere of Service Manager and using it to enable/disable services).This is a Solaris 9 book with a couple of paragraphs added. A complete disappointment."
1,Inacurate and misleading.,I read throught this book looking for coverage of the important new feature 'Service Management Facility (SMF)'. This feature is new to Solaris 10 and critical to the intended audience of this book. I found no coverage of this topic and other areas of the book described things that would not work in Solaris 10 because of the new SMF functionality.I would warn anyone who wants to learn Solaris 10 to avoid this book until it is updated to cover the 'Service Management Facility'.
4,A Good Basic Primer,The book was basic but very informative. It got me heading in the right direction unfortunately Christmas trees can be grow faster and better in other states besides Colorado.
5,Eagle One 2081616 NanoWax,"I have used this product for quite a few years. I have a few motorcycles and cars and its ease of use and long lasting quality is a major plus for this product. Even in the winter, this product holds up throughout the season. I would highly recommend to anyone."
1,poor service life,"I have found nanowax easy to apply, but wil not buy it for the following reasons:-turns chalky on dark plastic after a few months.-refuses to bead water after only 3 months of summer exposure.if it can't handle the easy seasons, how can i expect it to stand up to salt and sand??"
3,Hard to listen to loud,"This by no means reflects the performance of this great southern rock group as ""Playin' to Win"" is one of better Outlaws albums. My title pertains to the so called ""remastered"" version. 95% of the time remastered CD's sound great but this really isn't one of them. The overall mix is very bright and the vocals at times become a bit much. This is especially evident during ""Cry some more"" and ""You can take it"". Low end bass is somewhat lacking throughout. Also, the first song on the album (Take it anyway you want it), is suppose to lead right into ""Cry some more"". For some reason, there is a 3 second gap between the two and the first second or two of ""cry some more"" are cut out.I waited a long time for this to finally come out on CD, but I think I'm going to refer back to the ""vinyl"" copy until someone else re-releases this again with a better product."
2,Skinner ignores consciousness.,"Skinner poses an interesting arguement, but it is confined the the operations of the mind. Unfortunately, western education boasts of the intellect and its various processes, while ignoring the most beautiful part of man, the consciousness. The consciousness is REAL not a concept to be tossed about in intellectual conversation, like many beleive. Take not my word on the topic but discover it for yourself. There are many books which address the workings of the consciousness, but I would personally recommend the writings of Samael Aun Weor. Start with Revolutionary Psychology or The Great Rebellion. While reading, be sincere with yourself, otherwise you are wasting your time. If persistent, one may discover the mysteries of the universe, including the other dimensions."
1,What a waste. Fortunately they were free!!,"I got them from a hospital, so I do not feel bad for spending lot of money for nothing. And it would be spenging a LOT of money for nothing. I am not gonna write a novel here ""this vs that"", because all those reviews say the same thing. Nothing new. I will tell you though that as a hot mom I am a huggies fan for 2 reasons. 1st they DO NOT leak (and I am saying thins using all huggies for almost 3 years now) and 2nd is that thay are safe for your child. They are no animal tested (all huggies products) and they are not soaked with chemicals. And now I just have a little information for those ""MOMS"" who knows it all. Papmers and Luvs are one the same brand - P&G (Procter and Gamble) so of course they will be worth nothing :)!!"
2,"Again, No U-shape Cut","When we ordered the swaddlers there was a picture clearly showed the cut. On the second day, the order was back-ordered. Then we got swaddlers without cut. Of course, now there is no picture shown on the website anymore. What makes it even worse is that they somehow was able to put a packing slip to Switzerland into my box.I have to return the order.The price is really competitive at 7.49 though."
4,great for the new addition,I love these diapers. No leaks here! They are so absorbant that unless you forgot to change your little one recently you can barely tell it's wet when you change the diaper (and since she cant feel the wetness it leads to less crying). The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that you have to fold down the top of the diaper to aviod it rubbing the umbilical cord until it falls off.
1,NO UMBILICAL CORD CUT-OUT! ADVERTISEMENT LIED!,"I was extremely upset when I received the package and their was no cut-out. I specifically baught these diapers because the ad said they were. Horrible experience with amazon! For all of those who are looking for the umbilical cord cut-out do not buy from amazon, for they do not have any! Their advertisement is not up to date!"
3,Know how big your baby is??,"I was just writing this review to remind you moms-to-be that some babies are larger at birth. This diaper is only up to 11 lbs. If you have a larger baby, they won't be in these for long (or not at all) Some stores will let you trade an unopened package of diapers without the receipt for a larger size, others won't. We ended up having to donate ours to a local women's shelter because we couldn't use them & couldn't swap them at our local store, but at least someone needed & used them. I would just advise to be careful how many of these you ""stock up"" on."
2,"Leaky, leaky, leaky","We bought in bulk...BIG MISTAKE. These diapers leaked from day one and our baby was well within the size/weight range. About every other day there is at least one or two bowel movements that this diaper just does not hold in... Baby is soiled up the back, on the legs and sides, never to mind the ruined clothes, etc. We are very disappointed with these and considering they are the most expensive ones out there, it is really displeasing. We have since used Huggies, Luvs and even the Babies R Us/Toys R Us store brand (at $5.99 on sale for a 40 pack compared to the $11 plus for the pampers) with excellent results-- I mean it - no leaks at all with the other diapers. What a shame that these pampers really stink!"
3,Disappointed.,There really wasn't anything in here that I didn't already know. It was missing information like samples of different forms and a DVD which you could use if you had the book.
5,Unbelievable value!,"This is one of my favorite CD's of all time. Excellent performances by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra of all of the classical works of George Gershwin. An incredible 140 minutes! The ""Concerto in F"" is one of the best I have ever heard. If all you know of Gershwin's serious side is the ""Rhapsody in Blue"" buy this and listen to the ""Concerto in F."" Its second movement is as thrilling as anything Gershwin has done. Great value for your money."
2,American Breakdown meets Traffic,"My wife got this movie as a Christmas present this year. We read the back and thought it might be good. Had a kind of Traffic-like sound to it. It played out like Traffic. Meet one character after another and find out how they're connected. Very similar except that there was no plot and only one of the story lines gets an ending in this film. Glenn Close being cast as the acting ""superstar"" should be the first giveaway that this was doomed for the $5 bin at Walmart. Save yourself the time and $1 at Redbox. Get something else. Even American Breakdown was more enjoyable."
5,Classic New York Story,"It would be hard to add much to the well-presented reviews that have already been registered here over the past two years. Nevertheless, because of the inescapable ""wow factor"" of the film, I feel impelled to toss in -- damn, what a fine piece of work. Entertaining in every way. Wonderful writing--the reader comes to care about and appreciate all of the characters in the piece. Great, attractive cast with consistently smart acting. And, unusual for a film that involves gay people, there was depth and dimension to their characters and lives. The story could only have been set in New York--or so this non-New Yorker imagines--but it does present a credible backdrop of sophistication that probably isn't matched in many other parts of the U.S.Wonderful film which I wish I had heard about a lot sooner."
2,Tour of Alaska,"It's a great dvd if you're interested in a tour of Alaska and acoustic songs of the Goo Goo Dolls. Very nice pictures of Alaska, its people and countryside, but limited hard driving music. A lot of interviews, meeting of different group members and Alaskan residents. Just beware it's more of a tour guide and pictures than a concert of the Goo Goo Dolls."
5,NY Loose Rocks,Product arrived in a very timely fashion! I was able to purchase this CD for much less than any where else!
3,too slow to rate a 5 star,"Illustrator CS2 is an application loaded with features, but it is too slow that after I execute a command I wait almost 30 seconds before anything happens. Oftentimes I click again because there is no hour glass or timeline to indicate it is doing anything and that usually ends in Illustrator not responding and hanging up. I'm use to Photoshop being so fast compared to Illustrator that I get impatient."
4,Great stickers..............,These round stickers are great for a number of jobs around the office. What is even better is using the Avery online templates to make printing as easy as writting this review.............
5,Redeeming the Time - Where Do I Begin? Workbook,I am leaning a new aspect of God's holiness. Everything I do revolves around the way I view His holiness. Thank you for writing this Bible study which God is using to reveal Himself to me.
4,Highly heroic tale of survival.,"This man was a true hero who persisted against all odds toavoid the fate that awaited so many others who didn't havehis determination or faith. I highly recommend it to studentsof WWII, as well as a newer generation who have never had toface such a terrible ordeal."
3,Nice,"I love the movie itself and I loved the soundtrack when I was watching the movie for the first time.. It is greatly done but the only problem is that the length of the scores are less than you can imagine.. You start to feel the music but it will end soon.If you have programs that you can add musics together, you can do this with it and make the length longer.."
1,waste of time,"I am using The American Pageant in my AP US History class and feel that my knowledge of history is not as good as it could be, and I am very underprepared for the AP test because of ""Pageant"" being my only source of the information.The book is frustrating. It uses roundabout language instead of giving you the facts (for instance, saying ""every elected occupant of the White House"" instead of ""every president""). It is very difficult to figure out what it is trying to tell you.The book is very biased, and is trying to be something it cannot. I'd prefer something straightforward."
2,Worst book ever,"This book contained many bad jokes and lengthy paragraphs and is probably the worst book that i have read. It does contain alot of information and is rather comprehensive for a high school class, but it makes you sleepy and forces you to take a nap, which is a waste of valuable time. It takes about an hour to read each chapter. It may seem that it takes more since the book is very boring and lacking any spark. Don't take me as a history basher since i love history and may major in history at college. The book is a very boring book and you can't really study for your finals with it since it is very boring and you will take a long time to read the evil book."
1,A good look into the liberal mind,"Wow, now I know why this country is in the state it is.This author should be ashamed of this work. No wonder why our youth in this country are so liberal.God help us all with books like this in the classroom."
4,"Good, but at times a bit wordy","I used American Pagent in my AP US History course. I enjoyed it very much. The writing was so interesting, that at times I thought I was reading a book. However, when I needed to get homework done quickly, I found that I had to read through too much commentary to find information quickly."
4,Roots Ragga........Calling ALL True Junglists,DOPE!Move Y'all.............I and I know the roots of jungle is Reggae.....blend and serve.....hot never chilled Ragga Jungle Lives!
1,Why did I buy this cd,"I'll sum this up in one word, CRAP. Even for a live recording it's poor quality. This should have never been released. I'm a fool for buying it. The cd is crapeola."
3,"Real World, please.","This book contains some nuggets of truth but overall I was left dissapointed. The book doesn't really help a woman balance her different hats of being a woman, wife and, mother, but instead provides some basic information regarding each. I think the author comes accross as ""perfect"" and is preaching rather than sharing from her own learning experiences. I was also deeply troubled by the idea that praying over your unborn child will guarantee a perfect, whole, and complete child. Not so in the real world."
4,"Very handy, both for studio and location","I purchased it in March 2008 and very happy with my purchase thus far. Inexpensive, compact, sturdy. The only reason I rated it as 4 and not 5 is that it's very narrow and you can't sit on it. Otherwise it would totally awesome for any long-lasting event like a airshow or reenactment, when you need to be above the crowd, but don't want to stand the whole day..."
3,Needs a way to secure lock the hand truck so it won't fall over,"The hand truck/ladder is versatile but can be dangerous as there is no way to lock the hand truck in the down position so that when you remove a load it can fall over easily and hurt someone or break something. There is also no way to lock it in place to be able to place your load on it. Once you get the load on it works fine, but removing the load is difficult. The ladder is awesome as well, but a little difficult to store because of the size of the wheels. I will keep it and try to find a way to lock the hand truck open with bungee chords."
2,There were only a copple of good songs.,"There are seventeen songs on this CD, and I only liked about three or four.The good points about this CD is, the limited songs I liked."
5,The Shag Review,"I had this CD before and have since misplaced it. I'm highly disappointed, so now I have to buy it again. It is a great, fun CD! You can't help but dance like they do in the movie listening to these songs."
1,I'm Warning You!,"DO NOT BY THIS CD! It has the dumbist songs you could think of. I am the biggest Austin Powers fan in the world (hell I even have Mike's autograph), the cd is horrible!"
3,Good for readers! Grade 1 or higher,"This game is good for kids who can read already. It teaches them to really look at the words and figure out which word is spelled incorrectly or is the incorrect one in the sentence. The game voice will say the sentence the way it should be. Then the child has to read the sentence again to determine which word is incorrect. When he/she clicks on the incorrrect word, it changes to the correct one. The cartridge IS VERY good. After going through the story to correct all the incorrect words, you get a key to unlock some games. I gave it three stars because the pen sensitivity on this game doesn't seem very good (although our Leapster is getting old -- it is a first generation Leapster). But then the other games seem OK with the pen."
3,"Things That Make You Go 'What the .......""","My five-year-old LOVES his Leapster Batman game and Pet Pals game, but found this Spiderman game to be very disappointing. He has played the other games hundreds of times and only played this one one or two times. He guards the other games very carefully, but has left Spiderman falling down behind the sofa. It's worth about $5 of fun and that's it. Batman and Pet Pals have paid for themselves over and over."
3,Not good and Not bad,"The video is for an advanced ""signer"", and not really geared for a beginner. Many of her demonstrations were too fast to and the explanations far too long. She is an excellent signer and teacher, but her method was a bit too fast for me to keep up with, and I soon lost interest and enthusiasm. The introduction part of the video is incredibly long, and I didn't make the connection that the songs were all going to be signed and explained first, THEN presented. I was confused. Overall, Rachel is excellent at what she does, fun to watch, and the video was professionally prepared - very polished. Nonetheless, I do not plan to buy any more from this series."
2,Sniper interview not training,"This video is not as good as the book. The training in this video is basic information, it does not really teach the ballistic challenges and how to compensate for them. This is a good video for someone with no weapons training."
4,"Waiting on Alphie, a welcome twist in the hitman movie genre","Very interesting and unexpected plot twist is worth the wait. Solid acting on part of principals. Excellent performance by supporting cast. Editing was well done, with photo sequence segue moving the film along nicely while hightening the dramatic tension."
1,Swingers definitely does 'not' swing ...,"While I usually agree with the prevailing ratings by our fellow Amazonians, and admittedly the 4.5 average rating was a factor in purchasing this video, it was a big let down. The two main characters in this movie were simply 'swinger' wannabes; one thought himself way cooler than he was, by far, and the other was a hapless complainer. My wife and I endured the first 45mins before I started fast-forwarding, first 30secs at a time, then 1min, then 2mins, then by chapters. It was just awful, from beginning to end. And for those of you hoping to catch a glimpse of a younger Heather Graham, you'll have to wait until the last 15mins of the movie. This movie may have been viewed as 'hip' 10yrs ago but it clearly has not withstood the test of time."
5,My Life - Incredible,"I wonder if I should be embarrassed that this is my life, but I can't escape that this entire movie is my life. I wish I was a cool as Trent, thank God I'm not as bad as Mikey. If you haven't seen this movie, do it now. One of the best of the 90s."
3,"GET A NIGHTLIFE, SWINGERS IS HILARIOUS","HONEST AND FUNNY COMEDY HAS MIKE,A DUDE TRYING TO WIN BACK HIS GIRLFRIEND AND THEN HIS FRIENDS LIKE TRENT,SUE,AND ROB PARTY DOWNTOWN AT BARS AND TALK ABOUT STUFF.MIGHT SOUND SIMPLE,BUT HELPED BY PERFORMANCES AND HUMOR TO KEEP ADULTS AMUSED.WATCH THIS FILM AND IT IS HILARIOUS"
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie was incredibly boring! There was really no plot, it had so many uneccessary scenes in it, and some of the actors gave me a feeling that the only reason they were in it was because they were doing it as a favor or because they were extremely desperate! The only ""money"" thing about it was the appearance of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy."
5,A guy movie that doesn't suck...,"Finally, a guy ""talk"" movie that doesn't seem like a chick flick that has been masculanized. This is one witty, funny movie that goes beyond slapstick to get at some real character developement while sticking true to the film's entertaining feel."
1,Good for a novice couple,I got this to read as it looked like there may be some interesting ideas to expandour sexual activities. I would only recommend this book to a couple who is new to sexor to those so afraid to try new things that you simply are having a hard time doing anythingbut missionary sex.In fact I am not sure the author has much experience at all. Nothing in this book is naughtyand I found the authors promotion of passive/aggressive sexual communication theoriesa bit repressed as well. This book takes little time to read as it's a small book and should wasteno more than 2-3 hours of a normal readers time.If you are a guy looking to be a better lover I would recommend you read a book about women'ssexuality or a book about lesbian lovemaking as you will have much better information on whatreally gets the ladies going. If you are a chick I wouldn't waste your time with this book as there isvirtually no information in there on pleasing a man.
4,Hauntingly beautiful.,"This is great music, with outstanding performances, at a great price.Seriously, the superb St. Louis forces on two well-packed discs for cheap?? Abbey is no Horowitz or Janis, but he is a sensitive musician with a beautiful touch and give haunting renditions of these works. Even though there are more thrilling 3rds out there, I find this one staying with me. The contribution by the St. Louis Symphony is exceptional, outshining a lot of the bigger orchestras: they bring freshness, stunning discipline, positively glowing string tone, and make music with Simon, not just accompany him. I guess I'd best sum up this recording as one to cozy up to rather to put me through the emotional treadmill. Both kinds of performances are necessary in my collection!"
5,a great COMPOSER,iF YOU LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC--YOU WILL LOVE THIS rACHMANINOFF....wE NEVER HEARD A PIECE WE DID NOT LOVE...bARBARA cOOPER----A rACHMANINOFF LOVER
1,A shame I even bought it.,"This game ABSOLUTELY STINKS!I cant believe I even bought it.Its nothing compared to digimon world 2 and 3.I hope digimon world 5 is like number 2 with the DNAing and all.HERE are the good / bad things about this game:Good:battles are ok.Bad:lack of characters.I have no clue how to get a champion or higher form.WAYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOO REPETITIVE, I mean every level you go to are practicly the same and boring.ALL of your attacks are called petty something at first till you get mega something.YOU CANT GET PEPPER BREATH OR ANY OF THOSE ATTACKS!The bottom line is DONT buy this game.P.S.There are many other bad things that make this game stink."
2,difficult,the game is so difficult in the beginning. you dui and die and keep getting sent back. i think it takes a certain mindset to handle this game.
2,a decent review for this game,"OK, i bet you've read all the other stupid reviews like... THIS GAME ROCKS! and THIS GAME IS THE BEST! and one about homestar runner, which has NOTHING to do with this. well, the combat style has defenatly changed, instead of you attack, your opponent attacks, you can attack as much as you want. but after a while it gets boring mashing the A button at your opponet. u have about 3 attacks to do which u would b stupid 2 do cause u end up close to the enemy, and if they touch you the deal damage.But i guess that 1 guy likes dying though. so after you raise your level to about 7 or 8, you can save leomon, which is the first level of the game. 1 good thing is that 3 other people can help mash the A button at your enemy, so rent this game before u buy it. and if u like it well... that's great."
3,More Matt Berry Please,"This series is a bit spotty. There are some funny segments but you have to wade through a lot of ironic bad humor. I'm a fan of Matt Berry and prefer it when he makes the jokes instead of Fulcher. If you haven't seen Dark Place, I recommend that instead. If anything, It is comforting that bizarre sketch shows can get financing."
1,What a disappointment! Don't waste your money.,"What a let down! This DVD is a major disappointment if you are a Trading Spaces fan. They showcased the worst of the room re-dos, and barely highlighted some of the best work, especially that of Laurie and Vern. Very few of their rooms were showcased. Anyone watching this DVD would most likely never want to participate in the show, much less spend their time watching an hour of it on television. Short segments with little entertainment value. Even the bloopers were horribly boring. I wish I could get my money back. For a better investment, buy the book. Unlike the DVD, it's worth every penny."
2,Super short footage!,This footage was sooo short and only showed highlights. The biggest disappointment was Ty Pennington was not shirtless in this DVD!
2,"Very, VERY S-L-O-W","This is by far the slowest partitioning program you could buy. I only have a 2 gigabyte hard drive and I divided it up into two parts and that took almost 2 hours. Anything that you tell it to do, it takes an extraordinary amount of time. I finally got tired of it and bought Partition Magic that takes only 30 minutes to do the same thing Partition Commander did. My Recommendation is to leave this program on the shelve and get Partition Magic that does the job in a reasonable amount of time."
1,BAD,"pictures of mice, and a suggestion to use pine as bedding! If you have rats you should know pine causes resperitory problems due to the oils and such in it. It's just not a very good book, and she obviously isn't very well informed on rats."
2,Lousy,"I hate to complain, but Susan Fox did not do a very good job with the book. The first chapter was (I think) usless encylopedia knowlage. The book was very vauge, most so in the part dealing with rat illnesses. Maybe this book would suit a beginner to the world of rattery, but it did not please me and really let me down. END"
2,I think that some of the textual work is odd.,"I think that some of the textual work, such as that on Hosea 4:15 and 8:2 is odd. It goes to some lengths to keep the text together. In upholding the integrity of the text, the commentary does some problematic things to it."
1,relay swithch,"The switch was not as described and did not work for me, I had to return all 4, and pay for postage."
4,Clicking sound solved.,"When I purchased this unit in early December I too was disappointed when I heard the dreaded clicking noise in all speakers as discussed by other reviewers here. I made a search of the internet about this problem and talked with Sony technical support a couple of times with no solution. They finally directed me to a certified Sony Service Center. I took the unit in and they diagnosed the problem as a faulty digital integrated circuit in the audio receiver. They ordered the part and repaired it under warranty, no hassles. Since I have gotten the system back it has delivered the satisfactory sound I expected from a mid priced system and thankfully no clicking noise."
4,Good starter system with drawbacks,"The system is a good starter system for home theater and is not hard to setup. There are 2 drawbacks that I see: the first is the volume peaks at 75 and there is nothing above that, i feel the system could put out more sound than it does at that level. The second is when using HDMI cables you still have to hook up digital audio cables for sound and this may just be my ignorance on the cabling but i thought that HDMI was an all inclusive cable. Other than that the system functions well right out of the box."
5,"Wonderful, acoustic McGuinn","Roger McGuinn was, and is, the very best of folk rock singers. On this record he tells, with his very personal sence of humour and self-distance, about his musical history. But even greater are the musical parts where McGuinn performs some of his many hits on an acoustic twelve-string. Especially in Daddy roll'em and the acoustic version of Chestnut mare (which i'd actually never heard before) he shows that his wonderful voice sounds best when there are no drums or electric guitars to destroy it. As a bonus, there are two new studio tracks in the end. The better of the two, May the road rise, is also in the live part of the album."
4,Good,"These dvds are an excellent buy for the DB, DBZ, or DBGT fan. This set holds the root to the story of the red ribbion army which comes up frequently through DBZ. seeing this set allows you better understanding of how and why it all started with goku versus the red ribbion army.the picture quality is tradional to the rest of the series so far. not anything spectacular. the sound is sub par. you feel like you are watching it straight from tv.but besides that it is fine and to a fan that is all that matters."
2,Hazy Mulch,"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel. ""The Hazing"" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value."
4,A fun horror flick,"This is a fun movie. I suppose I view the horror genre as split into two camps - true suspenseful horror and not serious horror. On the former, I have very high expectations; typically the primary redeeming quality of those flicks is in its' effectiveness in the emotional parts (making the viewer feel suspense, dread, fear, etc.). It has to be very good to be effective. This doesn't necessarily imply big budget, but it does presuppose a talented director. On the other side - the not serious horror, my expectations are dramatically reduced. These films are often horror light, but set within the a context that is horror-ish, but with a primary focus on fun characters (often young stupid ones), and usually with some comedic element interspersed. This movie falls into the latter category. If you accept that its not serious horror, you'll likely enjoy. Its low budget, but highly entertaining. Fun cast, relatable concept (fraternity initiation), acceptable dialog, etc."
2,unfufilled promise,"Starts out well, nice to have the added twist of a partners in crime, but the character development of the other killer isn't there;his psyche is only sketchily hinted at....I feel this book has been highly overrated."
5,Don't pass this one by.,"If there is another writer capable of describing a character in such complete, aganizing detail as to make you feel as though that villain is sitting right beside you, I have yet to find them. Mo Hayder has a sense of description that is so detailed and complete that it has made her characters leap off the pages and act out the book right in front of you.Mo has created a set of villains so vile and repugnant that at times I had a hard time reading the words, but the need to know what happened kept pulling me back in.We do not want to believe that things as horendous as the one's in this book really happen, but they do. If they didn't, there would not be the need for the word necrophilia. This story takes you to the depths of the human animal. To depths I never dreamed existed.If you want to take a wild, disturbing ride, jump on.And If you make it through, definately dive into ""The Treatment"".This book is amazing."
3,It was OK,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was so excited to get my hands on a copy, as a love thriller/mystery books. Unfortunately, I really wasn't impressed at all. At times I even felt as if I were reading a different book from the one mentioned in the rave reviews. It seemed to me that the characters were not well developed, and the plot dragged at points. It picked up at the end, but there was nothing amazing about this book. I didn't find it particularly scary or intriguing. I finished it because I had started it, and while it wasn't torturous, it did not come close to being on my list of favorite books. Silence of the Lambs should not even be compared to this book - it is an insult!"
2,Good Writing - Sickening Murder/Multilation Details,"No doubt there is a market for whodunnits that list every grisley detail of the sick perversions that serial killers visit on their victims. If that ""rings your chime"" then, this book is a mother lode for you. Too bad for me; I don't get off on that stuff. This is an excellent writer and the personal details of the hero's life are much more fascinating than the murder mystery. But all that virtue is buried under such horrifying, stomach-turning descriptions of bodies hacked, sliced, and violated in every way - that THIS reader lost interest. Who wants this garbage in one's mind? If you do, go for it. I pass."
3,"slow start, but strong ending","At first I had the impression of this being another ho-hum detective book with a marginally interesting serial killer on the loose, baffling police, etc., etc. and for the most part, it is. This book, based on the first 75% of it, deserves 2 stars, but after that, it got interesting. The main story didn't interest me that much up to the last quarter, but there's a side story with the main character, his brother, and the neighbor that really did, just freakish. There's also another smaller side story with Caffery (main character) and his current girlfriend that's just whoa, get counsiling. With these side stories Hayder really develops the main character, you understand him. It's then that I started liking the book, and the plot twist that I have to say I liked too. But mostly I read it for Caffery's character than what was going to happen to the 'bad guy'.In general, a good book, just took too long to get there."
1,Not worth the money,This thing doesn't work....I've had it for about 2 years and it just leaves streaks and it's pretty much worthless....I'm actually going to throw it out when we move
4,Mierda comes in handy sometimes...,"...especially for gardening! Actually, I bought this book in college, and it's great! I am a teacher with lots of hispanic students, and it enabled me to understand what vile things they were calling me. I could then politely tell them (in Spanish)how their mothers would enjoy hearing our discussion. It was very effective. My high school age daughter thought it was the most fantastically funny book she had ever read, and is now majoring in Spanish in college. And no, mierda is NOT our favorite word."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know is right on the money!,"This book was great! I have never laughed so hard when learning about Spanish. There were words and phrases that will definately come in handy. Even if you just want to speak in another language, so people can't understand you. It was wonderful! I got glances from Spanish people that wondered how in the world I knew what they were saying. I highly reccomend this book if you plan to go anywhere that Spanish is spoken."
3,Rarity w/ Cult classic appeal,"First start with the fact that this was a sountrack written and performed by the 2nd Blood swaet & Tears, after Kooper and gang left and David Clayton Thomas showed up. Second is the fact that the soundtrack included tons 'o dialogue to fill the space and finally add the fact that only two songs really exist, with as many soundtracks include..tons 'o variations on a single theme..which in this case is quite jazzy. The opening credits are purely instrumental and is the gem here. This one cut is worth the price of admission.Oh, and the cover art is my favorite view of Streisand..in some garb that came right out of Lili St. Cyr or Fredericks.This is better than gold, for someone will end up with the last copy and have a goldmine..they have re-issued the video and this lp is destined to become boffo at the box office!"
4,very sweet bedtime story,This beautiful picture book is filled with wishes that parents hope will come true for their children. Some of those wishes are I hope you will always be curious and I hope you will always be a part of a family. Reading this book to your child will let them know of all the love you have for them with in your heart. Wishes for You would make a great bedtime story for kids of all ages.
4,An engrossing read.,"Alien Chronicles is a good start to the trilogy. There were some slow chapters but I think necesary in order to set the stage for the next book. Although this is the first of three, it can stand alone. When is the sequal to be in the stores? I can hardly wait to see what happens next."
2,"Old cliches put into a new format, or not so new.","Slow begining. A bunch of stuff already done before. . .over all, I wouldn't say it's a terrible book, it was okay. This will not go down in history as one of George Lucas's greater creations, not even really in the GOOD catagory. It's just another book about a race of people who have slaves and one of them decides to break free from thier evil ways. I wouldn't recremend this to you people out there who like alot of space-faring action, or like anything face paced, because this is not the book for you."
4,Feiyue Martial Arts shoes perform well,"I have used the shoes for several Taiji classes and they perform well. I am pleased with price, performance and comfort. I recommend wearing the shoes only for Martial Arts classes, not for general outdoor use as they are not built for outdoor use such as jogging, walking, bicycling, etc. Get the proper shoes for other physical activities. The shoes should give a long life if used only for Martial Arts."
5,Sneaky Sneakers,I love these shoes! They're soft and comfy and I wear them EVERYWHERE. I got them to do Tai Chi but found myself wearing them all around. They're snug to my feet but flexible and the sole are extra grippy.
4,Martial arts shoes,"The shoes were exactly as the description stated. They are light and comfortable and perfect for Tai Chi. The only detail worth mentioning is that they run small, so I had to return them and get one size bigger. Now they fit just fine."
5,The best Kung Fu shoes!,"The best Kung Fu shoes! They are also great for light everyday use, but not supportive enough for heavy use (like jogging or rough terrain)."
3,Size Does Matter!,"I ordered these to wear during workouts (WiiFit, Tae-Bo, and Yoga). I ordered a 38EU, which should have been a bit small, if anything, according to the sizing chart. Not so. They are actually about a size (or 1 1/2 size) too big. It's a shame, because they seem to be nice, otherwise, and would be great for working out. Lightweight, and seem to be well made. I'm going to give them to my sister, who should be able to fit them."
4,Nice and comfy,"Just received my Feiyues. Laced them up right away and tossed them on. Turns out I'm not exactly a 46, but it isn't the worst fit I've had in shoes. I'll probably order up some 45s the next time I order something on Amazon. If they last a few months, they'll have been a good buy for the price."
5,Great Shoe!,"This is a great shoe. The only problem I have with the shoe and what not is that, since it is European, the sizing is really hard to figure out.Had to return a shoe once but the only reason I did was because of the sizing issues."
2,Cheap Shoes,"They work great for a bit, the curve in the bottom are a bit hard to get use too. They will fall a part very quickly. You get what you pay for."
3,Design Needs Improvement,"Feiyue states in their promotion that Shaolin monks and masters order this product. Indeed, the shoes allow your feet to grip the earth and serve their purpose well. But, they commonly come off your feet, the metal eyelets come off, the soles and sides of the shoes break open. The Masters use their leg wraps as stirrups to keep the shoes on. The No. 1 consumer shouldn't have to improvise on the product. It's been a long standing complaint that Feiyue needs to update their construction."
3,So-so,"Unfortunately this shoe comes in a medium width and I need a wide width for comfort. Out of the bag, it has a very ""chemical"" smell and needs to be aired out well before use."
5,"Oh, the details!","As the other reviewers agree, the presentation of this classic poem in the form of a scrapbook is wonderfully imaginative and skillfully done. I just wanted to put in a word for the rigorous attention to detail this book displays! Many of the ""artifacts"", and ALL of the newspaper clippings, included as adjuncts to the main illustrations, are fictitious. It is just barely possible, if you know what you're looking for, to recognize the signs of computer image manipulation--but it is also easy to accept everything as real. The yellowed newsprint (which is NOT a digital artifact) is a beautiful touch.For those who like a peek behind the curtain, Mr. Bing explains a lot of what went into creating the book in a foreword, acknowledgements note, and colophon (all skillfully integrated into the scrapbook imagery)."
4,Caldecott Medal Honor Book,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this book was named a Caldecott Medal Honor Book for this year. I actually haven't read it yet, but just based on the cover art and the fact that it's about baseball and it is an immortal poem, I've given it 4 stars. Perhaps when I actually get my hands on a copy I'll add one more star to that."
5,Not for the hobbiest,"If you plan to get serious about airbrush, buy this book. The author takes you from baby steps to mountain climbing. While there is a fair amount of time spent on seemingly non-airbursh topics like the fundamentals of perspective, shadows and drawing in general, the examples and exercises take the reader to the deepest part of the art of the airbrush. Well layed out and enlightening. The book could, however, benefit from the addition of more intermediate exercises."
5,Wonderful!,"This works great! Never again will I peel garlic by hand!We make a lot of Italian dishes, so we go through garlic quickly, I love how easy this makes getting to the good part!"
3,"Attractive shoes, well made, but narrow","These shoes arrived pretty quickly. I bought them to wear to the office, and they look good with slacks. When I opened the box to try them on, I could tell right away they were narrower than the shoes I had on. They cause friction over my 3rd and 4th toe, but it's not unbearable. I've worn more uncomfortable shoes than these. And I will admit that I have wide feet! Anyway, they are very cute shoes."
2,You have to be kidding!,This is nothing more than a big bottle of liquid soap. You are better off at the dollar store. I tried as a shampoo and it left my hair dull and dry...even though I diluted it a lot. I tried cleaning with it but it didn't do an adequate job. I tried it as a body wash but again it left my skin dry. I have now resorted to using it for dog shampoo! would not recommend
5,The best of Dragonball starts here...,"Yes, this is where the predominantly comedy/adventure ""Dragonball"" series begins its tranformation into its more action oriented sequel, ""Dragonball Z"". Also, this is where you will discover in full detail the origin of Piccolo, one of DBZ's most popular characters. The saga begins with the murder of Goku's best friend, Krillin at the end of the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai (AKA World Martial Arts Tournament). In a rage, Goku rushes off to avenge his fallen friend, but is unaware that Krillin's killer happens to be the most powerful underling of the evil Piccolo Daimao, who has been set free after years of imprisonment to turn the Earth into a living Hell once again! This DVD set contains only the first ten episodes of the saga, but it just keeps getting better beyond that. If you're a true DB/Z fan, I highly reccomend you buy this and the rest of the saga."
4,Oman,"As a student of Classics and Ancient History, I really enjoyed reading this book; it gives you a general perspective of Rome's Late Republic history through the characters and deeds of seven Romans. It is beautifully written. There are some few drawbacks, however:(i)Why Cato and not Cicero. Considering that Cato had little impact on the actual history of Rome.(ii)The author is slightly reactionary and his economic analysis lack objectivity when regarding the Gracchi, especially Caius.(iii)It was written in 1902 and therefore it is not provided with some useful notions that were acquired only lately.I highly reccomend it otherwise."
4,Outstanding Intrigue!,"Not only is the story intriguing, but so is Mr. Kallbacka's writing style. His style is fresh and unique without becoming gimmicky. The story pulls you in, and pulls you on, to the next page and the next.He needed a better editor. There are too many missing or inverted words. Also, a good editor would have caught the few historic errors in background information. (For example, although Alan Shepard was the first American in space, it was Neil Armstrong who walked on the moon in 1969. This is in conversation among characters, so maybe the mistake is intentional.) The editorial problems do not detract from the story, however.This book is an extremely fine accomplishment for a first time author! The writer is a master of the craft. The story is very, very good."
3,"Great Game, Horrible Price.","This take is the final part in the first .hack video game series, and personally, one of my favorites. But sadly, all of them are way over priced!! I was pretty disappointed and wait with feeble hope that someone will either sell one at a cheaper price or will change their price. Otherwise it is an excellent game and worth my time in my young teenage life. Hopefully it would be worth your time too if you wish to pay the awful prices. ^w^"""
2,Voice Not Loud Enough Music to loud,"I was really excited about this one, but It was difficult to hear him, and the music was to loud."
1,Wish I could give it a zero!,"After reading so many positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I never ate this as a child so I have no attachment emotional or otherwise to it. Luckily, my local Kroger still sells this item so I didn't have to buy a case of it to give it a try. I have to say I was really disappointed in the flavor. It wasn't really a tangy flavor but rather a strong and somewhat bitter flavor. The noodles were very sub par as well. My husband and children wouldn't eat this and I ended up making sandwiches for dinner. I would not recommend this product unless you have that nostalgia for it. Please don't order a case of this thinking you're going to love it only to end up hating it like other people on here have. See if you can find one box and give it a try."
5,My dogs love them,I have two dogs. One of them is a picky eater and totally unmotivated by food (much to the annoyance of dog trainers who have tried to use treats as a training tool with her). I have purchased other treats and found that I had to give them all to my second dog (who is in danger of getting fat!). Not Newman's Own Cheese Treats! My picky eater loves them and eagerly competes with my other dog for her share. Excellent product.
4,a great treat,I have 3 dogs( 28 - 45 pounds) who love the treats. Nice size to reward them. I take them with me when I travel to the beach or dog park.
3,Typos are Distracting,"The plot started out well, but the typos and editing issues were a big turn off to me. I feel that the plot of a book can start out well, but if there are several typos that it just pulls me out of the story and I can't stay focused on it.I do have to say, the cover is what pulled me in, that and this book was a freebie so I shouldn't complain too much. I just wish there was more depth over all with everything.If you can push through the editing issues, it's somewhat of a good story to read."
4,Always,"I'm not going to beat the dead dog like other reviews. It was a good story. If you like Harlequin type romances, I think you would enjoy it. Give it a whirl!"
4,Sweet Southern romance,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. I truly believe the cover doesn't do the story justice. It was really about a great, historic old Southern mansion and the secrets and lies of the family that lived there. It wasn't as long as most stories of this type and focused mainly on the romance. However, it was well written and I liked the tension between Cole and Elinor."
5,Very enjoyable free read,"This is an enjoyable free read,and yes it has a few incorrect spelling but not so much as it's not enjoyable. I really liked this book as it instantly captures me."
3,Always,This book needs some serious editing. There are so many hyphenated words that shouldn't be hyphenated that is hard to read.
5,This is a great book,This book is a great read. I could not put it down. I do think this book would make a great movie as well. It is a well written book I could picture every scent very well with the details that Carol Rose gave it felt like I was there. I will be recommending this book to all my friends. I am looking forward to reading more of Carol Rose' s work.. what a great writer!!!
4,ALWAYS.what a great change of pace,"Very good read, the characters seem as normal as any one else. I read it quickly because it's that good."
3,It was okay,The plot of the book was good. I felt that it took over half the book to really get going though. I had to make myself finish reading it.
4,short but sweet,A good concise read with clearly defined character rolls throughout. Nice read for those short moments where one can read without the depth
3,Ok for the price,"You get what you pay for. The socks were ok at the local mountains, couldn't complain, but I wouldn't take them to Aspen or bigger resorts. They stick to the leg pretty tight except for the toes, quite loose in there. Overall I like them with my snowboard boots and not so cold SoCal mountains."
2,Rocky and Bullwinkle DVDs,Great Rocky and Bullwinkle memories. Extremely happy with this purchase in every way! Hope Moose and Squirrel seasons 4 and 5 will be made available soon.Note: Due to a power failure during the data entering process this purchase received only two stars. We purchased all three seasons and they are all FIVE STARS!
4,SportBran iStep X Pedometer,"The concept for the pedometer is great. That is, a pedometer that allows you to keep track of your activity on a computer. The downside is that you are limited to the SportBrain Web site. It would be great if someone would produce a pedometer that has software that can be used on a computer without enrolling on a specialized Web site. Other than that, the pedometer is great."
5,WOW,I adore the film and could watch it over and over again and the soundtrack is every bit as perfect and charming as the film!
4,The Ghost and the Darkness,"Another one of Goldsmith's rare and truly amazing works of art. Listening to this score makes one want to go out and view the beautiful open lands of Africa with ones own eyes. Goldsmith's blend of Irish and African folk music is pleasing to the ears and further reveals his musical genius. This CD holds 12 tracks of good Goldsmith music then accompanied by 5 tracks with African and Indian chants. The final five may seem strange at first, but if one is willing to open up and enjoy the music, they can be a great experience as well."
4,The Greatest Gundam Game Ever,This Gundam game is the best. The new combat system and anime scenes from the series will really blow your mind. The best edition to the game is the many mobile suit to choose from. My favorite Gundam on this game is the RX-78GP03S. I recommend this game to people who loves Gundam and shooters. Buy this game now.
5,A wonderful book for beginning to intermediate drummers.,"This is a well written book with great advice. Having been a drummer for a few years, I thought this book would be a joke but was pleasantly surprised. Not only does the author cover the technical aspects of percussion (i.e. standard rudiments, rock and jazz grooves, tuning tips, etc..) but the interviews are wonderful too. It's a treat to get advice from a legendary drummer such as Hal Blain. Don't pass this little gem up. Michael Miller did his homework and offers great advice for the novice (I'm not a novice and learned a thing or two). Enjoy!"
1,Not good for two door BMW.,Definitely cool product for holding jacket or coat...until you put the seat back and it falls to the floor. Perhaps useful for a four door...but not for a two door. I would not purchase again.
2,just get an LED flashlight,"I got this since I had a smaller version of it that I liked. However, I now prefer LED flashlights as they are brighter, the LED basically last forever (unlike bulbs that break and are expensive to replace) and are very good on batteries. Skip this and put your money towards a quality LED flashlight."
2,Soviet quality,"The conductor has a nice touch, if uneven tempi, though you have to listen carefully. Sound quality is barely passable - the orchestra is in a can. At least they miked the cougher; you catch every throat clearing. Remastered to bring the best possible sound from back in the U.S.S.R.1 1/2 stars. 2 stars is generous."
2,Weak plotting and Didactic Tone,"I'd really enjoyed the series and movie, Noah's Arc, so I looked forward to seeing the director's next project. But the Skinny is a weak movie. Too many of the conversations revolve around sexual matters, as if young gay people have nothing else to discuss. The plot is generally not creative and does not explore some of the potential issues it raises. This should really have been several films: 1) an education film to inform young people about the importance of safe sex, of staying off drugs, of taking care of each other and practicing good hygiene; 2) a reunion pic about people who stay friends although they have moved on in various ways; 3) an examination of the class conflict and questions of promiscuity and fidelity in Black Gay Culture; 4)a rom-com about two friends who rarely get laid. Good idea to call it ""The Skinny"" because it's a mighty thin movie."
4,The Skinny,Great movie! Funny and well written. Hot cast! 2 words... Anthony Burrell! Def a new fave of mine. Makes me happy to see more movies with faces and stories like mine out there!
3,Countess Confidential,"After her father is framed for being the Wraith, a master thief, Claire is forced to go undercover, working as a lady's companion in the family that cast off her mother, in an effort to find the truth that can set her father free. A major snag in her plan comes in the form of Simon Croft, the earl of Rockford. He is determined to wed the lady to whom Claire is a companion, to fulfill rash promise. It is Claire who catches his full attention, however. She has no time for romance, or for anything that can interfere with her plans, but Simon is determined.*** Ms. Dawson Smith effectively uses prose to create a well written, multi-layered story. Though the romance is more the focus than the mystery, fans of both genres are sure to enjoy this. ***Amanda Killgore"
4,A Great Single!,"QED's ""LOve Bites"" is one of the best dance singles i have heard in years! Even though it is a re-make of def lepards song. If your a dance fan, DJ or a DJ thats a dance fan its a must have to your collection. With the sound of Lasgo and Dj Encore you'll love it! I know i do!"
5,Pretty good,I came across Greyboy while finding music along the lines of Quantic. Greyboy is very impressive. Mixes jazz with dope lofi beats.
3,so so,When I first found this item it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. They were a bit smaller than I expected but was giving them to an emergency room nurse and figured the size would be appropriate. The only dissapointment was when I asked them the next time I saw them they said the back broke off the first time they wore them. Guess you get what you pay for.
4,A decent average quality sheet.,"This sheet feels a little stiff when you first take it out of the package but it softens up a bit when you wash it. Don't expect an extremely soft sheet; it is about average, but, for the price it isn't bad. Also, unlike many people I prefer the cotton/poly mix in my sheets because they don't wrinkle nearly as bad as pure cotton.I would recommend this sheet to all but the most fussy sleepers."
4,He sold me on alternative energy but not on hydrogen.,Roy does a very good job of explaining hydrogen production and the various methods that can be used to create it. He also does a very good job of explaining the need for renewable energy and how it could have 'anti-inflationary' effects if we spent the money on that instead of wasting it on non-renewable fossil fuels that could be put to better use in manufacturing.Overall it was a good book and I did learn a few things reading it.I would recommend reading another book after this called 'The Hype about Hydrogen' that will point out some of the drawbacks to hydrogen.
5,summer favorite,"I've gotten load of compliments on these lights..the unit may look kinda cheesey in the daylight, but at night it really looks magical. Try placing it near a water feature so you get a reflection. The battery last a long time, I've gotten up in the middle of the night and the lights are still flashing. Be careful not to drop the base because it can crack, but otherwise it's pretty sturdy."
2,Needs some help -,"Didn't burn w/Nero 8 and any DVD's I have (DVD-RW, DVR-R [HP]). Other units I have worked fine. Does read DVD's & works for ripping movies. Still working on possible updates (bios, etc.)."
4,DVD RW CDROM,"This product works fine. The last DVD CDROM you sent me would not work on my slower PC. So it was a crap shoot to find out if this latest one would work, it did. You need to put in the description of the item what type of machine that it will work on. Also the install instructions might as well been non existent. You didn't tell me how to install the HP Drive on an HP PC."
3,Good Drive - Annoying Software,Drive work s great - the annoying thing is that you have to buy software to play movies.
2,Tried,"Unless you read the book, it would be hard to follow the storyline, where was Geronimo to account for the two Apaches in the Jail?. Josey Wales used the original percussion colt, too many mistakes."
1,For beginner's only,This is strictly for beginner's only!Video is very basic and moves very slowly. If it weren't quite so boring it would actually be comical in places.This shipping could also have been a little more dicreet. Video came in a sealed brown box but area where shipping label appeared was open and invoice could be shifted to the reveal the name of the video to any one who handle it and was nosey!I will not purchase another video of this nature from amazon again due to the shipping package.
3,good but gets lame,"Ok this show is a good show alright. I'm not taking anything away from it.These first 25 episodes of yu yu are good but they do tend to get boring. I would not buy this dvd if anyone plans on watching it over once or twice. But I do reccomend it for people who like the anime and like to watch it over and over again. I would definetly wait till the dark tournament box set comes out. A much better saga, better animation and fight scenes are way better."
5,Amazing concert !!!,"Such a performance, Travis on fire !!!. Great concert. It's a pity this band has been so ignored by the mass media. Neverthless fans know this group is fantastic. Fran's voice is outstanding, as the rest of the band. This is a pleasure, get it now !!!!"
5,The Lord's Supper is not just a ceremony,"It was as a Passover meal was concluding that Jesus took bread and grape juice from the table and began what has become what some call a religious ceremony. Mike Root points out that each time the meal of remembrance is spoken of in apostolic teaching and practice, it was done as part of a meal. Since every Christian is a priest, the author points out that ""the Lord's Supper"" needs no priestly intercession in order to be pleasing to the Master. Excellent thinking and writing is ""Spilt Grape Juice."" Many will be surprised by what is obviously taught in the Bible about our walk with the Lord Jesus. This book ""tells it like it is."""
1,NOT AS SHOWN,"The shoe you get is a different version of the persuade in black leather. The bow is made of patent and patent embellishment all around the rim of the shoe. If you google, you will find that version. The one pictured here is NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET."
1,Remnant,"I bought two Richard Brautigan books at the same time, and they both had the same problem: they were labeled ""New"", but had the the distinctive black mark indicating they are remnants. They were both old and dirty; a real disappointment."
3,Another Fun $1.00 DVD,"Cartoons R' Fun Volume 6 Includes:The Crystal Brawl (Popeye)Inki and the Minah Bird (Looney Tunes)Flatheads (3 Stooges)Hairbrained Barber (3 Stooges)Dover Boys at Pimento University (Looney Tunes)Land of the Lost JewelsThe 3 Stooges cartoons are pretty lame; typical poorly animated 60's television fare. The two Warner Bros. entries are pretty entertaining, although ""Inki"" includes one of the many potentially offensive stereotypes of the era. ""Lost Jewels"" is a fun romp and Popeye? Well, he's Popeye."
3,Just What I Looking For,This software isn't perfect but it certainly served my purposes for getting holiday cards out this year. The database was easy to use. The help menus were good but sometimes did not match what was contained in the pull down menus. I loved the label and envelope templates but they all omitted the salutation field (Mr. Ms. etc.) and I had to make my own which took some practice and know how. For what I paid for this software it was just fine.
4,Nice Set!,I purchased this set a while back and have used many of the bits and pieces that come with it. I have no complaints about the quality of the drill bits or other pieces. It is not top end quality but then you really didn't think it would be with the low price. This is sufficient for the average homeowner whe does work around the house from time to time. The box clasp broke about the third time I opened it but not really a big deal to me. It is now on sale for 25 dollars. Get it!!
1,"Corduroy's ""Out of Here"" should go exactly there","As an avid fan of acid jazz, I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that this band is labeled as such. Sure, it contains some elements of funk and jazz, but the overall quality of the music leaves a lot to be desired. Highlights of the album include the tracks ""Mini"" and ""Motorhead"". Those are really the only ones I enjoy. Unfortunately, the music could be tolerated if it were not for the cheesy vocals that dominate each song. They sound like they belong on a children's record. By the way, where are the horns? They could do nothing but help this trash."
2,not that good,Jams after a two inch cut every time.then you have to slowly work it out of the cut to clear it. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,Don't buy this,Don't buy this it only has like three matches. buy the dvd set it has like 6hrs of matches
3,Very misleading stop!,"Please stop giving previews of the dvd.If you must do previews then just rate it 3 stars nit 5! If the dvd is a total flop, like most from wwe are, then all these 5 star previews will be counted towards the average rating! Dont you get that?If you have to do a stupid preview than just rate it 3 stars not 5!"
4,great dvd,well i would like to say i really like this dvd. it has all of the greatest matches from the undertaker. im not gonna write a review on all the matches because i would just be saying what evryone else has said. but i would like to say that all of the matches were worth warching. the hell in a cell mayches were the best. the only thing that sucked was the packaging of this dvd. those a**holes packaged the dvd by putting all three dvds on top of eachother. what the hell were they thinking. they shouldve packaged this dvd the way they packaged the wrestlemania dvd. other than the packaging this dvd was very good and enjoyable. it was well worth the money. so if your a fan of the undertaker or just got into wrestling and u like him then buy this dvd.
3,"Fun at first, but doesn't hold their attention.","My boys just turned 5 and this was the first game they got for their Leapsters a month ago.They are both nuts about everything Thomas, but this game doesn't hold their attention. They played with it for the first week, but haven't asked for the cartridge again since then. It just doesn't seem challenging enough."
2,Very excellent picture of product.,"This is a one-dimensional one-sided plastic product, almost like a Halloween mask from Walgreens. The chain fell off immediately, it was destroyed in a matter of hours. However, well worth it for the pleasure it brought in those hours."
1,cheap/breakable,"I got this to complete a tinman costume. My 4 year old was very sad, as was I, at the poor quality."
1,"Very cheap, overpriced but it is a Halloween Costume Piece","What can you say about a little plastic clock that probably costs .10 to make, it is what it is but for a 4 year old who is Tin Man, you need to complete the costume. Go Tin Man."
1,Why didn't i read the reviews?,"I wish i would have read the reviews. the photo on the entry looked like the real thing, it is about as flimsy as a cheap paper plate. not sure i will even use it for our oz production."
3,IT DIDN'T SURVIVE THE WASH,"This Hawaii Warriors shirt was a gift for a special person. After wearing it one time, she decided to wash it paying attention to the washing instructions. The next time I saw the shirt, it was sadly very faded. I have to question the production of this item. Not only did I give this one as a gift but I know a couple of other friends who received this very same shirt. Will they know the pain of a faded favorite shirt? I am very disappointed in my purchase."
2,Not so sure,"I saw the series in Hulu but off course, over there there is too much comercial so I decided to buy this Item. I noticed that there was some material in hulu that was not being shown in the Amazon version . so I not sure"
3,great chill out music but lacking in dynamic,This is an interesting recording which uses traditional jazz instruments that have been 'electrified' to produce some fantastic drum and bass. However the music lacks in emotion and dynamic as well as group cohesion. The tunes are a little repetitive. However it is still an interesting and from a minimalist perspective successful experiment.
5,My son loves them!,"We bought this set for my son, as he is now 16 months old, and was getting bored with the rubber ducky that we had. We only gave him the boat and police car so far. He loves the police car. He likes to squeeze them, though he hasn't figured out yet that he can get water inside to squirt. I make sure after baths to squeeze out the water, to lessen the likelihood of mildew build-up (though I'm sure it will happen over time). He's played with it for over a month, and so far so good!"
5,Great bath toys,"My 14 month old loves these bath toys! I've had to scoot his bathtime earlier in the evening to allow a longer bath before bedtime and avoid him throwing a fit when I pull him out of the tub. He hasn't figured out the squirting part yet (for which I'm grateful--bathtime is messy enough as it is!) but he loves to run the cars around on the bathtub floor. Nice products, fun to play with! A real hit for my son."
3,Interesting enough but not practical,"This book is not exactly as the title suggests. It's a very academic, scholarly, ivy tower analysis of the criminal underworld. It's not a how to guide. It doesn't offer much practical information. This book is not going to teach you any street skills And, reading the book tends to be tedious at times. The book can be very dry reading. I will say that the book provides some interesting reading in parts but overall, I'm not sure if the book was worth the time and money."
4,"Subtle beauty, brilliance","Though I am generally someone who isn't terribly impressed with pop music which lacks vocals, it is so apparent that Christian Fennesz is a master of his craft who rarely needs input from that particular instrument. His use of guitar and laptop is so human and emotive, it's easy to see why so many artists (from the Junior Boys, to Ryuichi Sakamoto) are attracted to his work.It seemed to me readily apparent why My Bloody Valentine is frequently referenced, due to both artist's attraction to creating beauty in distortion and dissonance - just about every track has this quality (excepting perhaps final track The Stone of Impermanence, which feels almost like something from a different recording session)."
2,Must have been written by a 14-year-old boy,"Apparently written by a 14-year-old boy and animated by his best friend as an after-school project. INCREDIBLY overrated. Not funny, not clever. Horrendous dialogue sequences. I had been expecting something punchy, clever and sexy. Instead I ended up with one of the biggest disappointments in my DVD collection to which none of the aforementioned adjectives can be used to describe.I also just totally don't get it overall...is this an animated Web series? Why is the main episode here animated, while the extras are all live-action? It just doesn't add up.By the way, the ""XXX"" bonus feature (which is anything but...although it does have some actual nice-bodied women in bikinis) is far and away better than the main feature. I actually could watch it without fast forwarding through the whole thing."
3,Search somewhere else,"Being an intermediate-level programmer I was able to breeze through the first few chapters with ease. The text explains fundamentals fairly well and it gives plenty of examples.Progressing further into the book, past the fundamentals was quite a challenge. The chapter on pointers is poorly described, seemed rushed, with examples that are inadequately explained.This book is OK as a reference if you already know what you are doing. Otherwise for a good intro book to C++ I would suggest C++ How to Program by Deitel and Deitel."
1,Worst I've ever had,"This is the worst crystallized ginger I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. Rather like suger-coated wood chips in sub-standard packages. They might be suitable for boiling to make ginger tea but the flavor is nothing to write home about. I would avoid this stuff. This a much better product for a lot less money:Ginger, Crystallized - 5 Lb Bag / Box EachSo is this:Ginger Cuts, 5 lb bag"
1,A Kid In King Arthur's Court,"A Kid In King Arthur's Court is the worst movie I've ever seen! It is SO corny! It absolutely SUCKS! I would not reccomend it, unless you're into ""hardcore cornography""!-Aaron A."
4,Pretty good product!,"I ordered Proventure Greeting Cards, and I am pretty satisfied with them. There are alot of different card and letter designs to choose from. Also, you get some free new cliparts for your computer. I gave this product 4 stars, beacuse I was expecting a few more borders and designs, but there was a good number of them. There was enough variety of the cards to use for different, personalized cards, though."
4,A child of the self-absorbed,"The story never reveals if Helen is an only child, but her behavior suggests it. George is an only child, and when two narcissistic personalities collide, it is the children that suffer. Ruth understands early on that she is just another household piece to her parent's eyes. She takes it remarkably well, although I would never be able to forgive her parents' selfishness.Although the ending, what refers to Roddy, is quite abrupt and should have been worked out more, I found this a very satisfying novel. I did not enjoy Hotel du Lac, so this was a wonderful surprise."
3,one good movie,"Michael Keaton has been in some good movies and this is one of them. One Good Cop is more of an action drama than a ""shoot em/kill em"" type movie. It has a good story and you care about what happens to the characters. If you are a Michael Keaton fan or just like entertaining cop stories then this movie is one to see."
1,I think the cast n crew are writing previous reviews.,"I give the creators of this film credit for effort, but c'mon, it's just bad. The bikini girls might be eye candy, but oh my g-o-d, the dialogue and delivery is painful to watch. It's like the worst thing that could result from a Hee-Haw/Benny Hill union. Bad redneck slapstick. Bleckkkkk. Just awful."
2,Just terrible- truly awful,"I'm probably going to pile up another heap of unhelpful votes by criticizing this moldy oldie, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love older movies, but just just because something is in black-and-white doesn't mean it's a classic. While Novak and Harvey- like most old time movie stars- have a certain sophistication and maturity that is lacking in today's actors, this movie fails because nothing happens to their very uninteresting characters. A medical student falls in love with a lower-class whore, who betrays him and then comes crawling back several times. It was just excruciatingly boring, and the mental anguish was so intense that I had to turn it off even before its denouement, if there even was one."
5,It's about time!,"I have been searching the web for a copy of this AMAZING movie for years, and could not find a copy (okay, that wasn't on Beta, ridiculously over-priced, or required a translator to purchase)and FINALLY the distributor came to their senses and re-released this gem!This movie is, simply put, one of the finest examples of modern dance, with a quirky but telling story line, and a great cast. Say what you will about ""Chicago"", which is a fine movie in it's own right, but ""All That Jazz"" is sublime, and Ann Reinking proves once again why she was Bob Fosse's muse. No one has ever been able to interpret Fosse the way she can, and Roy Scheider is wonderful in his lusty performance of Fosse's alter ego.Let's hope that more of these forgotten greats start getting resurrected!"
5,"Moving, cynical and funny","This movie has haunted me since I first saw it many years ago when it first hit theaters. Heady, hectic, wry, dramatic, funny and touching, it is a truly unique musical."
3,Self-indulgent Mess.,"Can something be both aesthetic and tacky and the same time? All That Jazz, the semi-autobiographical move by Bob Fosse comes close. The film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for movie cliches without realizing it; the characters come across as one-dimensional, and the protagonist fails to arouse empathy or even pity. The saving grace of the movie is the choreography, though at times (like in the finale) even it wreaks with Fosse's ugly self-affirmation. For a superior over-produced mess by Fosse, rent Sweet Charity."
1,Waste of money,"I finally decide to buy this amazing series, and set down to figure out which ones I needed to buy to get the complete set. There was a LOT of talk about season 2 vs season 2.0/5, but absolutely nothing about season 4. Now since no one mentioned what episodes were in the season 4 package, and there wasn't a season 4.0 package, I rationally assumed that 4=4.0. Incorrect. 4.5 was created for some nonsense reason, since season 4 has ALL of the episodes on it, making 4.5 a complete waste of money. Don't buy this!"
3,Battlestar Galactica :Season 4.5,"I did not enjoy this season as much as I expected. It did wrap up most of the details of the series, except for the contradiction of Starbuck's two dealths. However, overall, it was too obvious an ending for it to be our earth. Really, in all the Universe that is not unique! I was diappointed."
4,Great Throw,This throw has beautiful colors and graphics besides being warm. It washes extremely well. Can't wait to get one with Dale's new number and colors.
2,It's o.k.,"This DVD was ok. Didn't blow my skirt up. left me feeling lonely, even depresed. Felt like eating ice cream with butterscotch. Also the the bikini's were itchy. Other then that this DVD did not have the quality I was hoping it shoud have had."
2,You need Courage if you order this medal!,"This was a disappointing purchase. The medal looks like something you purchased from the dollar store! I would not waste the money! If you are a collector, wait until you get free shipping; I sure wish I had!"
3,It's fine for a costume,"I recently was Prop Master for a Wizard of Oz production. I ordered this for the Lion (and the heart for Tinman, both made by same manufacturer). The medal is very thin plastic, there is really no ""back side"" as it's just hollow white plastic. Honestly, it doesn't look that great up-close. In order to use it for stage I hot glued a few metal washers on the back (to weigh it down, otherwise it was flopping everywhere) then covered the back side with some gold colored felt. I added a thick metallic golden cord so it could be hung around Lion's neck. It looked perfect from the audience. Probably fine for a Halloween costume, but certainly is not a ""collector piece""."
2,Cheaply made,"I had to replace the safety pin with a better pin to hold it up, cheap! Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap!"
3,To let you know:,"As a toy for a child, to recognize an effort in something to motivate him, is good, as a recognition for a friend or as a detail as friendship, is good too, but the one in the picture is too different as the product, actually in picture looks good, that was the reason why i bought it, so be aware of that, and buy it wisely depending of what you really want it, if its for a costume, as a toy for a child, or for a friend."
3,"Good movie, poor image quality","This is described in the title itself as ""enhanced."" No, it isn't. We were looking forward to see this old classic in a restored version. We must wait for something else."
4,"Wonderfully Done, Well Preserved","This is a great movie with great performances. Moreover, though, the DVD edition shows great ""tender loving care"" for its subject. The sound track is crisp and clear - no ""rising hiss"" or annoying back noises. They took this one frame by frame to restore it.The special features are great too. I learned much about how Walter Huston was recruited into this film, and how the leading man/leading lady combination dictated Rene Clair's decision to rewrite Christie (a mistake).For Agatha Christie lovers, and for fans of the 1930s. You get a better show than you probably would have in a movie palance in 1939! And reflect, too, on the ""murder in a teacup"" flava: people in a big house isolated on an island that looks like a miniature Alcatraz, cut off from outside communication, and they still dress for dinner...gotta love it."
2,"""LINDA GOODMAN""--Who bought the name?","in what appears to be a highly political move on the BANTAM front, a sweepingly general put-together of mostly vague to inaccurate planetary tables(aLMOST HALF THE BOOK) in a mass reading market already innundated with ALL the basics of astrology. i doubt seriously any real authorization was involved as its elusive and again vague explanation of c.b.'s (b.d.6-9-49?)acquiantance with M.A.K...ahem...only serious linda goodman ""fans"" should own a copy of this book.GAK! reviewster from the earthquake zone is write, to me. i bought this book two days ago and have spent two sleepless nights wrangling with its contradications.although the book love signs seems to still physically elude me periodically, the most important lesson gleaned from that has been that things are not always what they seem and people are sometimes too willing to believe whatever they are told. well, i better quit while i still have a head!"
4,A great oldschool baseball game,I played this game as a kid and I recently bought it to relive my childhood. This game is fun because it features special powerups such as photon ball which goes really fast and a heavy ball which often breaks the bat when pitched. This game is fun if you're looking for an easy game that is realistic enough but still has some cool features. The season mode and edit team feature are also nice for a super nintendo game.
4,Kraft knew how to get dramatic sound out of historic organs!,"As an amateur, a listener to Bach and not an instrumentalist, I cut my teeth on these old Walter Kraft recordings years ago. Sometimes they are very sober but clear, other times Kraft cuts loose. The greatest occasion of his ""cutting loose"" is not here: The Prelude & Fugue in e minor (BWV 548), the ""Wedge."" There are a few organists who have understood the dramatic possibilities of this 2-movement organ symphony (e.g., Virgil Fox). Like Helmut Walcha, Kraft plays the pedal trills in the fugue, at considerable speed, and escalates to full organ for the recapitulation of the fugue. (It's the Nyhoff/Johansen at Lüneburg.) I hope the entire series from the old complete Bach organ works will be reissued."
4,"Nothing fancy, but solid all-around worshipful performance","Kraft's style shows little flashy registration or displays of virtuosity. It would not be well-suited to most French music. However, he uses the principal chorus very well, and his playing is precise and solid which is well-suited to German music. In many respects it gives the feel of a Lutheran church service more so than a recital."
1,Vox Issuing the whole series,I understand that VOX will be issuing the entire set in their new masterings at their website Jay
4,"Great Fit, ok material","Got these unexpectedly over night, Amazon's shipping is amazing as always! Jeans are a great fit (36x36), I got the sand dune material and I really like the way they look. I'm 6'6 about 220 so they were definitely tight at first, but are stretching out a bit, which I was planning for. I really wish they had more 'stretch' styles and that they made a 38x36. I wonder why Levi's doesn't.All in all, a great pair of jeans and great service from Amazon. Will definitely be buying more.Cheers!- M"
3,Should have listened to my mom.,"Just like my mom always used to bug me about when I was a kid, these pants are a bit tight in the crotch. The rest of the fit is fine, but they don't fit anything like a similar pair of 511s I have (gray with a little bit of stretch). As a result, they look nice, but I doubt I'll be wearing them often since there just isn't enough room in the crotch for the legs to move comfortably. It's a shame, because they look pretty good."
4,Good Jeans,"Great jeans but beware that these will fade more quickly (or at least they did in my case) than most other dyes of these jeans.I wear 32x36 and am a pretty slender fellow, so finding jeans that I can wear can be quite the difficulty. Levi's 511s are my go to choice though, as they are long-lasting and well fitting."
2,Color Not Black,"Not BLack, but color is Grungy Blue popular with teens. Slight tint of wore out green.Mislabeled as clean dark black jeans. That is only complaint on these jeans."
4,very good,"Not much to say here, these are Levis, pretty much everybody knows about them. The price is pretty right and the quality is good. Actually just a tiny bit looser in the thighs than I was expecting, but I have very skinny legs. I would recommend, although I think a better choice would have been a dark blue wash, I didn't realize these were actually totally black."
5,Levi's Men's 511 Skinny Jean,"Good price, perfect quality. Very good model for young people. Gorgeous color. Classic zipper. I'm satisfied! I recommend to buy it."
3,Cheap,"Crotch blowout in front of 1500 people, no undies. I loved these pants, they look good and they are comfortable. Too bad they only lasted a month."
3,Nice but pricy,"These are nice jeans, typical good Levi quality. My son is tall & thin, 6'2"" 131 lbs and the 32/34 fit him good. But these are expensive! He has some Old Navy skinny jeans that are just as nice but only cost about $24. So that is what we will be buying from now on. These are not worth the almost $20 more. Only 3 stars because the price is so high."
1,Shoddy..,The waist was 3 inches bigger than the stated size and the fabric was fraying on any folded area... I'd recommend you get these in a shop where you can try them on since it seems they are really irregular.
3,Run 1 or 2 sizes smaller...,"Made in China. As all clothing made in Korea, Taiwan and China, these products tend to run 1 size smaller.I'm waist 32, ordered 33, it is still too tight for me (i know it is slim fit but it is way too tight). Returning it for a size 34.Quality seems OK, no weird smells. Noticed some tiny fabric balls formed in the fabric.Hope this helps potential customers."
4,Watch out!,"If U want to buy these jeans watch out for the size! The waist was ok with me, I am 30"" but the problem is in the calves! So if U have big calves, be careful because they are very thight in that part!"
5,Hip and cool for my 13-year old son!,"These are my son's go-to jeans! So much so, that we had to buy two pair! Levis, always a classic no matter what the trends"
1,"Be careful, they ship faulty clothes","I have various Levi's 511 33x30, and I really know how this size fits me. The item that was sent to me had a label saying it was a 33x30, but was really much smaller. So be careful, the ship faulty merchandise."
2,inconsistent sizizg,"I must've orderd a half dozen pair of livs over th past few months, and none of them fit the same, none of them made in the same country and none made here in the USA. I find it disappointing and problematic. I love shopping on Amazon, but this type of inconsistant fit makes it very difficult to shop here for levi's. Thank goodness Amazon will refund you gladly, but must caost them a fortune on shipping charges. Im still trying to find that majic fit."
4,Good Ol' Levis,"What can you really say? If you've owned them, you know they are great. If you have not owned a pair, I don't believe you!The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I've owned more comfortable jeans, but I have to pay the extra. Levis are always right around $30-40 on sale.Shipped fast from amazon so that was nice too."
5,Not too skinny,I was afraid to buy these as I thought maybe they would peel on and off. Not at all what was wanted. But they are just nice slim jeans for men with thinner legs. No more baggy leg pants. If you have heavier legs these would be skin on you.
2,i don't like it,the jean is coarse.It is not same as the real one in the speciality shop.And it is not fit very well
3,poor finish,"Astonishingly poor finish, and we are talking about Leevises. It came with a lot of strings and stuff, and the waist size in these skinny model is considerably small than in my 501's"
5,Drops Like Stars Tour Film,"This is a fun, inspirational film. Rob Bell tells it like it is with humor and much wisdom. The photography is amazing. If you like Rob Bell's books, you will love this."
4,yay happy,"it's good. danceable, yet, much more interesting beats and lyrics than the average dance music. plus, it's more catchy than some of his earlier stuff and his stuff with the blow."
5,Flame on you demon!,Oh Funimation- please dub this. The story is much like Soul Eater with a school for kids who rid the world of evil. I like how the brothers are brothers first and try to protect each other. The supporting cast of class members are fun to get to know. My favorite demon is the cook.
1,Should be in the fiction-horror section,"Well, I am not financed by any right wing think tank (but if there's a think tank out there that wants to finance me--right or left--, give me a call!), but forty years ago Ehrlich was predicting massive global starvation in the 1990's. Well, I went throught the 90's and I don't really recall that. If you're looking for a scary but fictional story, read Steven King...or Paul Ehrlich I guess. But let's not pretend that this has anything to do with reality."
1,2011 update,"""In 2005 the United Nations Environment Program predicted that climate change would create 50 million climate refugees by 2010. These people would be fleeing a range of disasters including sea level rise, increases in the numbers and severity of hurricanes, and disruption of food production."" As of today, these areas are showing the largest population increases in the world. Research for yourself ----- [...]"
2,annoying beep. did it's job?,"Had this UPS for several (3+) years. Worked fine but I guess batteries weren't mean to live forever.I had one surge that killed the UPS tho. The UPS just beeps annoyingly despite trying to plug, unplug, reset or charge the battery again. I'm guessing something shorted (UPS did its job and protected the electronics) and needs to be replaced? Just a guess tho."
3,Unforgiven,"Unforgiven1)Eight-man Tag team matchKane & Booker T & Goldust & Bubba Ray Dudley vs. The Un-Americans... I like it because the comdey action! 7/10 The Un-Americans didn't make it.2) IC titleY2J (champions) vs. Ric Flair... This match was good match but it is short match. 6/10 Y2J retrians the IC title.3)Edge vs. Eddie... Boooo! 4/10 I can't remember who was winner.4) ""Interoromotional"" Tag Team MatchBilly & Chuck vs. Rosey & Jamel... Billy & Chuck is my farvoite team so, the match are good. 6.5/105)World Heavyweight ChampionsRVD vs. Triple H (champions).... I liked it, oh, no... RVD was lose the match. 9/106)Women TitleTrish vs. molly Holly.... That boring match! 2/10 trish is an winner.7) Kurt Angle vs. Chris Beniot... I love it because this had lots of cool action! 8.5/10 ""Here your winner is Chris Beniot""8)WWE Championship MatchBrock (champion) vs. Undertaker..... It is like ""quiet"" match. that don't bad match. 8.5/10 Brock win and retrians the title"
3,"(Cry, Cry, Cry) Wheres Jeff Hardy?","None of the ppvs around this time featured one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, Jeff Hardy. Jeff is a main event wrestler, and Im' glad hes being used to his full ptential as a main eventer in tna cause he was never used right here."
2,2 stars for 2 great matches,"Wwe Championship Undertaker vs Brock Lesnargreat match,this match when outta hand at the end! a mustsee ...gotta see what taker did to brock at the end!!!angle Vs benoitgreat match ... must see!!! good movers,i like theend,must see!!!!!people but this tape just to see them matches..the rest was just dumb not good matches"
3,Unforgiven was as good as should have been expected,"This event was a very solid ppv with some excellent in ring action. The show starts off with a surprisingly good 8-man tag match between the Un-Americans and Kane, Bubba, Booker T and Goldust. The second match was a decent match for the IC title in which Chris Jericho uses some tricks to win over Ric Flair. Edge vs. Eddie Guerrero was another great match between the up and coming superstars. A ... interpromotional match between Jamal and Rosie and Billy and Chuck followed. In the first main event, Triple H defended the World heavyweight Title against RVD in an excellent match with some shocking interference from the Nature Boy. The womens title changed hands when Trish beat Molly. The match of the night was Angle vs Benoit. This one might have been the match of the year. A mat classic. Undertaker vs Lesnar was a brutal match for the WWE title. A disappointing ending to most people but I loked the idea of fueling the rivalry with a non finish."
5,An Excellent Read for Fans of the Genre,A very good compilation of stories. Mr. Means seems to have a particularly acute perception of the downtrodden and the seamier episodes of life. The author seems to be at his best--when he describes (in graphically illustrative language) the most despicable of scenarios. I like this book--because I like the grittier side of life. This author is very adept at capturing these dark moments.
4,"""Nord Nord Ost"" by Subway to Sally","For those who like rock music with a twist. Gothic and medieval influences. Good music, interesting lyrics and nice art work."
5,this product delivers,the megaphone worked perfectly. no complaints--other than those from people around us when we're obnoxious with it
2,balls fell out,"I purchased this somewhere else. I believe it is the same brand, but not positive. I just threw it out. I used it for applying sunscreen and liked it at first (I had high hopes), but over time (maybe 6 months) the balls fell out. I think that the sunscreen dried on it and then rolling it around broke it somehow. So maybe if you clean it out after each use it wouldn't happen, but for me that is a huge hassle. Maybe it wouldn't happen with a thin lotion. I am going to try to find a product that is just fabric on the end of the handle for sunscreen application."
3,angle it just right or scratch your back,"It works, but you have to perfectly angle it flat on your back. If you are off a little the sides of the circular applicator will scratch your back."
2,I bought two...,"I bought two, one for me and one for my sister-in-law. We have been swimming in a chlorinated pool alot. One applicator worked well, the other one has balls that get stuck and don't roll. I still like it because it does the job."
2,"Works Until it Breaks, but Breaks Easily","I feel like a sucker for continuing to buy the Roll-a-Lotion. They work well for the short time until they break. The roller-ball assembly is fairly durable, but its clear plastic lid, the screw-on part, and the handle base are all very fragile. Just screwing the lid back on the roller-ball assembly after filling it with cream causes it to begin cracking. Mine have lasted anywhere from three months to two weeks without breaking--no more than that, with one use daily at bedtime. I really wish they'd construct one out of higher-quality materials.Note: I've since tried the Hydas Body Care 2-in-1 Body Creamer with 2-Piece Handle, which is very similar, but much better constructed. I'd recommend it instead."
1,Roll-On Lotion Applicator,"I knew something might go wrong with this product and it did.. It states its not messy, boy were they wrong.. It was one mass of cream on a half of my leg, it was terrible and the plastic case that went over the spores of the applicator became hard and messy from the lotion staying inside the casing.. I dont waster lotion, too expensive, and I wasted a 1/4 of a bottle of good lotion that I just could of put on by my own hands.. But I just cant reach down to the bottoms of my feet or on my back, so I thought this would be something for me.. I was wrong.. But Amazon reimbursed me for this product and even tho it was only $2.00 and tax, they stated anytime I didnt like the product, I didnt have to send it back they would just reimburse me for it.. The money was back in my bank less than 3 days later."
2,Roll-A-Lotion Applicator,I found this product difficult - getting the lotion to roll off the rolling balls (ended up putting lotion on my hand and smearing it on the balls to apply; cleaning it was a pain; then the balls started falling out. *shrug*
2,Lotion applicator,Great idea but doesn't work very well. You are suppose to take the top off & load up the inside with lotion & the little balls are suppose to distribute the lotion. My husband & I tried it on our backs several times & it just doesn't work.
1,"Good idea, but cheaply made....don't buy!!","I loved this when I first starting using it. But it is very cheap. The sidewall where the head screws in broke in 2 different places, not even when I was using it. Just when it was sitting in a drawer! Back to looking for a decent applicator..."
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed wirh this product as it does not live up to its expectations. You and I both know how difficult it is to get your back covered! This procuct in my opinion does not allow you to cover this area. The design does not allow the lotion to flow out and provide coverage it gets clogged inside, not to mention the small balls that are supposed to spread the lotion fall out! Would not recommend this product."
3,"Good Idea, works ok!, bad matterial ...","You need to be carefull and not to use much force on it in order to last. It work ok for me, means you get some amount of lotion on your back's skin, however they're uneven and you would need to use your hands to rubbe to make it even. The plastic feel cheap and some of the balls were made uneven, therefore, amount of lotion came out ofcourse uneven. I wish if it is made in a better materials and I am willing to pay more for it."
5,Roll A Lotion is pure genius.,"Living in the northern US, the long heating season invariably leaves my back dry and itchy. A similarly-afflicted friend and I were joking around, speculating on how one might design an item to apply moisturizing lotion to hard-to-reach areas, and spotted this item online.I'll admit, I was skeptical about products like this. Are they effective? Wouldn't they be messy? Some offer replaceable applicator pads, but who wants to keep buying refills? Roll A Lotion has all of these concerns covered.Unscrew the floating-ball head and load in your favorite lotion, cream, gel. Apply.I've used mine for a couple of weeks, and it works perfectly. Nineteen rolling balls apply a nice even layer of lotion, no mess, no fuss. Thicker lotions work wonderfully; I use Curel. Keep in the shower for quick moisturizing after toweling off. To clean, remove the applicator head and rinse under the faucet.Your back (or any other hard-to-reach part of your choosing) will thank you."
1,Very poor Quality. Does not work well.,"I used one of these on and off for about 6 months. It is very poorly constructed. And it does not work well anyway. The lotion is not applied well. The balls do not roll very well. some of the lotion dries up and then the balls get stuck. I got frustrated with it and left it, but then decided to try it again. I was still very disappointed. Then a piece of the side wall just broke off. I decided then I've had enough of the crap and threw it away. I would not recommend this product it all. I wouldn't even want it for free."
2,Not too thrilled,"Although it works, I find that the outer edges scratch my back. And, you can not put any kind of lotion in it. You can't put a thick lotion in it or it doesn't come out very well. I also find that you have to keep the reservoir full at all times. Not impressed with it and I bought 2. One for myself and one for a relative."
1,Will not last long,"I bought this mixer about a year ago, lured by all the wonderful reviews and specs of the machine. The first 2 months it worked beautifully, I was super impressed because it mixed smoothly and quietly in little time compared to other mixers, and everything went right into the washer. After that period, the machine started sounding funny, it was still working so I thought maybe it was there all along and I didn't notice. Fast forward to 10 mos after purchase and the machine died, just turned off and that was that. I sent it to repair under warranty and it takes about a month to fix because the repair shop is in Detroit. I had a KitchenAid, never had a problem, I was stupid to sell it because I wanted a bigger capacity machine...I DO NOT RECOMMEND this mixer! I bought an extra warranty for it, but didn't use it since it was still under factory warranty, but given how long it takes to get a repair from Viking that was a mistake too."
4,Works Well,"Wife does some serious baking likes it better than 6 Quart Kitchen Aide, the motor and transmission are strong does not seem to struggle under heavy load"
3,laugh till you drop!!!,"this is one of my daughters xmas toys from santa. when she opened it she couldn't stop laughing, to her the noises it makes are well if you have watched them on tv you know what i mean. she plays with it everynow and then but when she does she gets some good laughs. It still looks new, but then again my little one who's 3years and 4 months takes very good care of her toys. the boobah has been dropped a few times (by me). And it there isn't much difference in the play or demo mode. but I would buy again just to see her laugh like that."
1,Do Not buy...Very disappointing,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday. It kept his interest all of 30 seconds. It does not do much, and it is very loud. Even when you put it on the floor to dance, it kinda of just shakes from side to side. We thought it would actually dance around or provide some type of entertainment. My son loves the show, but this was very disappointing."
3,Easy to read but not totally clear,"I belong to a group of people who are learning Mah Jong. We found this book to be useful, but incomplete."
3,Rudimentary,This is good how-to book but doesn't have anything in it to help you learn strategy beyond the beginner level.
3,"Not Bad, Not Great",For the most part this recording is fair. The Neapolitan songs are very well done and some of the arias from French opera were very nice. The big disappointment is Nessun Dorma from Turandot. In this aria Di Stefano is horribly flat on the penultimate high note that for many makes this aria so exciting. It would have been best if the producers could have found another aria for the collection.
5,Excellent Product,Glad to find this notebook here. Everything I needed for an excellent price. I strongly recommend this product.
1,HORRIBLE PAIN!!!,"WILL NEVER USE THIS AGAIN!!!!!! Used this on my 7 yr old after swimming and her compaining of water stuck in her ear. I put the recomended 4-5 drops in her ear and she WENT NUTS WITH THE PAIN!!! I have never heard her scream that loud! She was in SO MUCH PAIN that she could not be controled for a minute. I was finally able to calm her down and had her hold an ice pack to her ear to numb it.unfortunately I had to give any stars, because it should be negative!HORRIBLE!!!!!"
1,cold weather problems,"I waited till the weather got cold to really see how these shocks function. Weather under 25 degress causes these shocks to not extend and provide comfortable ride. Cold weather causes these shocks to not fully extend when weather is below freezing. Above freezing temps, shocks work well. Don't recommend for Wisconsin winter usage. Rough ride."
4,Thank you,"Once again, you have done a wonderful job in service as well as a wonderful product. These shoes are so cute and comfortable. Thank you again."
2,not as excepted,this book talks more about acupressure and how to use it but does not go into that much depth for accupunture.
1,Book I never received,"These vendors of Amazon are a joke. I have attempted to purchase this book several times, each from one of the Amazon Sellers. Each time, they confirm the order, charge my credit card, and then cancel the order. Yes, I do recieve the refund on my credit card, but what's up? Can Amazon do a better job of screening their Seller's?"
1,Item never received,"I never received this item. The vendor was contacted and indicated that his records show it was shipped. The vendor credited my account with the purchase price. I don't think that the ""Star"" rating system applies in this case."
1,PNY DOESN'T BACK WARRENTY,The fan went out so the card over heats. PNY tech support buy phone and email states there is NOT A LIFETIME WARRENTY for this product even though it states that there is on the box and under Technical Details on Amazon's page. I will never buy another PNY product.
5,Wow- good reading!,"Now this is interesting- the artwork, dazzling, the stories, amazing. White Wolf has a habit for sating the needs of the insatiable- they give us, in this black tome, an incredable myriad of info, myth, intrigue. Fascinating and entertaining, this one is a must have- plus, as a bonus, it looks stunning on the bookself. It is mainly concerned with covering the ancestory of the vampire all the way back to Caine, rewriting bibical passages to vampiric effect. If you like books that are very rare in form, content and quality, get this one- it's a tome any student and lover of Darkness couldn't unlive without."
4,OK for the price,"PROs: It fits, it worksCONs: Difficult to thread ends into the bar, difficult to adjust .I should have purchased a ratchet bar."
1,FRAUD,"this does NOT have VHDCI connectors. it has MD68M connectors false advertising. Also is not new, package came was already ripped open."
4,Good book and I would tell others to read it.,"A friend told me about this book . I got it because it was free. I liked the book, however, it was depressing at times due to the life of Othello. But, it had a good ending and I love good endings."
4,Literary club,Good reading. Book club literature. I enjoyed this book. It was worth the time reading. It thrilled the heart. Ok.
5,cry into the wind,Absolutely perfectly written! This book will keep you up at night! I could not put it down! It is very inspiring. Mrs Bach is truly one of the the best. I would actually give it 100 stars!
4,Thank you,Thank you for your continued prompt and speedy service which I very much appreciate and the reason I continue to order from Amazon.
5,Mesmerizing,"My mother told me many stories of her years spent during the Depression living in Oklahoma during the dust bowl days in a family of 12 children, and I thought no one had it harder than her family did until I read Othello's book. My heart went out to Othello from the very first line in her book. I cried when I read about her visit with her mother in the hospital and afterward when she innocently waited for her mother to return on Christmas Day. I railed against the cruelty and indifference of her father and couldn't believe that no one in their family would take the children in. I highly recommend it to all."
5,Very Good,"I'm am a Recreation Therapist at a behavioral health hospital and I use this book for a variety of activities. Very good for all the uses that are in the title: self-esteem, teamwork, communication, anger, and coping skills. However, while the book provides these great activities it doesn't supply the needed debriefing properties that are key for my line of work. Over all very good."
4,Nice book,"Great ideas for use...mix it with play therapy and wow!Assessment and Treatment Activities for Children, Adolescents, and Families: Practitioners Share Their Most Effective TechniquesCreative Interventions for Troubled Children & YouthMore Creative Interventions for Troubled Children and YouthCreative Interventions for Children of DivorceCreative Interventions for Children of Divorce"
3,Not the standard null modem cable,"I'm not sure what kind of cable this is -- it's not a standard RS232 db9 to db25 cable. The pinout did not match up at all. The pinout was (db9-->db25): 2->2, 3->3, 4->6+8, 5->7, 6+1->20, 7->5, 8->4. Standard pinout should be 2->3, 3->2, 8->5, 7->4, 5->7, 4->20, 1->8, 6->6. Needless to say totally wrong for what I needed it for and I decided rather than order another cable from somewhere else or attempt to send this one back, I'd just cut the cable in half and rewire it myself. Luckily it worked out, but definitely check what your pinout should be before ordering this. There's more than one type of null modem pinout."
4,Great!,"I bough it to take advantage of my blue tooth equipped Nokia 3650. I was done in 15 minutes. No lie. Seems to work seemlessly with XP. Note: The directions (I think) fail to mention that you have to reboot twice. I think it only mentions one reboot. That was the only hiccup I had. Apart from that, it worked fine."
4,Excellent camera at a good price,"I am truly impressed with the quality of video I get with this camera. It's small and easy to use, and at an affordable price. However, the battery that comes with it doesn't have much capacity, even though larger/extra batteries are readily available. The ""ho-hum-quality"" still-photo feature is a waste to me and seems inconsistent with an HD video camera (if HD is important to someone, so would be hi-res stills that they would probably rely on getting from a second good quality still camera). I would much rather they included the accessory light and an inexpensive carrying case with a strap instead of the snapshot feature, even if it were a little more money. I can't imagine anyone not wanting the accessory light and a way to protect the camera, so I gave it four stars instead of five."
4,Muy buena cámara,"La HV20 esta muy bien, todo lo que se escribe sobre ella es cierto. Tiene una calidad de imagen excelente pero recuerden NO ES PROFESIONAL. Aún asi se le puede sacar provecho con practica. Lo único en contra es que en condiciones de poca luz pierde puntos, ah, y la batería no es la gran cosa. Por lo demás muy bien. Y con algunos accesorios como el lente angular y una bateria con mayor capacidad mucho mejor."
5,Great camcorder,"I bought HV20 to replace my 7 year old Canon ZR25. It performs much better than the ZR25 under low light condition. The high def recording it awesome. You can buy a camcorder under 300 dollars, but I think the extra 400 dollars on HV20 is well worth it. I did not notice any motor noise, maybe my ears are not that sensitive. Right now, I export the HDV content as DV to my computer to burn DVD. Once the HD DVD/Blue Ray becomes abundent, I can burn the content in hi-def. Overall, it is a great camcorder."
1,didn't last long,"Camera worked well, but after a few short years it's door won't open. I sent it off to be fixed, but Canon says they no longer make the part. I'm wondering why they are stillselling cameras for which they have no parts."
1,Worthless- only fits specific car models,Dont waste your money like I did on this heater. I tried it on three different vehicles and could not get it to fit on any of them. It was to short to reach into the oil on every vehicle.
1,Piece of crap,I bought this for my Mercedes diesel when Chicago dropped to -10. I installed it in the dipstick tube and plugged it in- but all I got was a little bit of smoke. There was plenty of oil in the pan- but this heater apparently burned out within 10 seconds. After 5 minutes plugged in I pulled it out and felt it- the thing wasn't even warm. Don't buy one.
1,flimsy,"If you notice in the picture, it isn't pushed all the way back. When you do it flops in the back and the cabinet door hits it when you shut it."
3,For light weight items,"I planned to use this to store food sealer bags but they are a bit too heavy for this, I noticed it sags a little. Also, make sure you have weight on the top shelf over the rack's legs to keep this rack from tilting unevenly. It would probably be fine for aluminum foil (as pictured). Do not buy if you intend to use with anything heavy."
3,Not very sturdy.,"This shelf came exactly as described. I do wish it was a little more sturdy, especially in the back. The shelf grippers were bent when it arrived, but easily moved back into place. You won't be able to put too much weight on this shelf without it beginning to bend again."
3,MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE THIS,I drooled over this when I saw it posted several times on pintrest. So I was quick to order it without even thinking about measuring. That being said when I put it in my cabinet the door wouldn't shut all the way. I really like the product and wish it would fit so I just settled with putting this in my pantry instead. Just make sure you measure this before you order it.
2,Not high quality,Not impressed with the initial quality. When the shelf was received there were a few welds broken. I did not contact the seller since I liked the size of the shelf. I modified it to make it stronger and work where I want to.
2,Cheap,Mine doesn't look a lot like the picture. The metal at the top is cheap and can't hold the basket. It wobbles around. If it was sturdy it would be great!
2,cheaply made item. not very practical,"Even if you get your measurements correctly, the item doesn't hold up that well. The end started sagging quite a bit once you loaded it up with heavier warp like aluminum foil. Would not recommend getting this."
2,Not very durable!,"I loved this at first, but it lasted at most a month. I contacted the seller and they offered to send me a new one. Over a month later I hadn't received yet and ended up getting a refund since they couldn't tell me when they would be in again. I'd recomend against this and go elsewhere."
2,doesn't fit shelf,"This is a great idea for saving storage space, and it doesn't require you to drill holes in your cabinets like other wrap racks. However, it doesn't fit my cabinet shelves (about an inch too long) and they are regulation size. Just measure before you buy."
3,Wrong Measurements,"I would recommend that the seller update the measurements of this product (listed as: 12 1/2 x 12 1/2 x 5 1/4). It's actually 13 1/2 x 12 1/2 x 5 1/4, so too big for my cabinets.I give the product 3-stars anyway, because it is a sturdy product, came well-packed - my basket didn't arrive damaged like some others did. If it were the correct size, I would have used it - I'm a little short on space in my new ""kitchen""."
1,Horrible,This product is worthless. The basket I received is different from the one in the picture. The gap between where it should slide onto the shelf and hang is much wider than shown. It seems sturdy but when you put things in it becomes very flimsy. Hopefully you have a better experience than I had with it but I would not recommend buying it.
2,Not a space saver,"While it does its job, I found it to take up more space. I have those very large cabinets which go from the counter top all the way to the sealing (old school). The shelves are evenly spaced & are almost 2 1/2 feet a part. More then enough space to fit something. This thing took up 1/2 of my shelf (up to down). But it is solid and does hold."
2,frustrating,The Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All does not stay in place. It shifts very easily when removing items from the rack or putting items on the rack.
2,Weakened by selective ommissions and inaccuracies,"The impact of this work is greatly undermined by its inaccuracies, so numerous that clearly cannot be listed here in full. An example is the notion that Jews represented a majority population in historic Palestine throughout the last few centuries. Another is that Arab and British propananda have been more greatly at work that Zionist propaganda in skewing international opinion surrounding the current conflict."
1,Disappointed,Listed as capacity of 250 pounds...second time I used (Weigh 200 pounds) legs collapsed and deposited me on the floor...fortunately no injury...would say in an engineers safety margin weight limit should be about 150 pounds at best.Cane Sling/Seat
1,CD,"I was very disappointed in it, but I thik it was my fault because I didn't read it close enough. I think it was a waste of my money and time to get it because I will never listen to it."
3,Item not received.,I have not received this item yet. It is on back order. I had to rate it so put 3 stars. However sicne it hasn't been received I can't really rate it. You ought to take situations like this into consideration if you're going to do this sort of thing.
3,pretty good sequel to a classic.,"Lame that this inferior sequel is on DVD before the eerie original is.I know it'll be out sometime,but here's the first sequel.It's a decent story,but it seems TOO similar,and the creepy tone of the original is missing.Still,it ain't bad,and Terry O'quinn is great.The dvd looks and sounds nice and has alterate scenes and a commentary track."
4,Definately Worth Seeing....,"Hey there movie fans...If you've seen the Wonderful part 1 of this title, Stepfather, you wont be too dissapointed with this Stepfather II sequel.It brings Terry O'Quinn back with a good story line, after all, we all thought he died in Part 1 at the end but he didnt.and im not spoiling anything here people due to a PART 2 !!!!Basically like part 1 our infamous step daddy wants the perfect family, perfect house, and perfect wife!!! all is going 'oh so well' when..... well, you'll have to find out!All i have to say is that, this wedding scene ROCKS!!!!!It takes allot for my jaw to open with disbelief. Its a pretty good flick. I'd add it to your Crazy Stepfather Psycho movie list!enjoy! I'd like to hear back from any fans out there that seen this. FlaMiataGlenn@aol.comSoFlaGlenn"
5,Hilarious,The antics in this book remind me of things my son and nephew did as youngsters. I laughed with the turn of every page.
3,OK----Not quit his best,It`s an ok movie not Magnum`s finest hour. Too many of the scenes are choppy and not fluid. Maybe if the budget had`nt been $3.15 and the story line was a little more original. But who assigned me as a real critic!!
1,no hold rack,Unit not capable of holding door frame.No rain gutters on nre cars. Angle of bracket and length not well engineered. Unusable for Honda cars and CRV
4,Worked to go 3000 miles,Travled over 1500 miles to our Christmas destination and then back with this and the Rain X bag w/ no problems.
3,Adequate with limitations,"We purchased this rack to transport a Porta-Bote which weighs approximately 60#. The bars can handle the weight, but the clips which attach to the sides of the car above the window are inadequate to secure the bars. (We have a Chevy Malibu). The clips are too short as they come around the upper edge of the door opening. We had a similar rack from another manufacturer a few years back and the clips were much more substantial. To compensate for the flimsy clips, we ran ratchet straps completely around the racks, the boat and through the windows into the car to hold everything tight. The only problem is, when you run straps through the car and it rains, the water wicks into the car. We found out the hard way and lost some silk lamp shades in the process. Live and learn! Final word....they worked okay for the price and they worked better with a little ingenuity."
5,"Highland 2005200 48"" Black Universal Car Top Bar Carrier","Great carrier, great bang for the buck, works fine. Just remember it's universal... may not fit your vehicle as ""perfectly"" as you'd like, but it's going to work."
4,Pleasant surprise,"Given the economic price didn't expect great things from this rack however I was encouraged by the reviewer who had no place for J clips (me neither) and that a strap across the inside worked. I did the same thing and it works great with my kayak, nice and secure. Did have to glue the rubber pads on but that was no big deal. You do need to know however if you are travelling in rain, the strap gets wet and seeps down into the inside of the vehicle (hence the rating of 4 not 5) Other than that am very pleased, for me this works better than a permanent mount roof rack as I don't lose gas mileage when I don't need the rack."
1,Completely useless and dangerous,"We used these to carry a kayak on top of the car. About a minute after hitting 60 mph, the kayak fell off of the roof and into the middle of the highway. Thankfully there wasn't anyone right behind us, and oncoming traffic stopped for us while we removed it from the road. What had happened was the straps holding the racks to the roof had frayed and broke. They are made of cheap and inadequate material. We ended up having to strap the kayak directly to the roof."
5,Stress tonic exponentiated by Shilajit,"Product works as advertised. Yet, there is nothing too special about this tonic. Low potency organic ingredients made more effective by inclusion of a fulvic acid source - Shilajit.If you want the real deal, try to get the version sold in India - Geriforte, which includes all the bhasmas ( purified mineral ash complex) and used for all the published clinical trials.I avoid hot and spicy, too sour foods in meal when taking these caps."
2,Brittany's Review,"This kid he has a girlfriend and one day she calles him and breaks up with him and he is crushed. He goes and tries to change his image to get her back and she doesnt even notice. He even goes and gets his hair cut, she notices and doesnt even like it she thinks he is weird! She says that he isnt what shes looking for, she wants tough, mean guys. So he decides to go and join the lacross team! He works at it and he makes it. On the first game he goes and tries to get her to notice him and she does. The way that she notices him is when he goes in for the goal and he makes it but he gets tackled! And he breaks his arm, and everyone feels really sorry for him! So now he can't play on the team because his arm is broke. HE tries so hard to get her back but she doesnt notice him. The book was kind of boring and slow it, took me a week to get it done."
5,"Right Size, Nice Price","Yep, it's the right size alright. Same as what came in the box with my H.O.T. Magnum aquarium filter. (That one lasted over 10 years, so I didn't think I'd need to purchase the 3-pack of these...)Necessary as a pre-filter to keep the 'Micron' cartridge or media basket from becoming clogged too quickly. Very durable. Rinses clean and goes right back to work."
5,Last release but best sound,"Even though Iron Monkey broke up after this, I still love them for this album. To put it quite simply to explain their sound, you would have to imagine the heaviest Black Sabbath riffs made, and multiply them sixty times. The results are even heavier. The noise these nutters make is like a fist in an iron glove, slamming into your gut when the first song plays. Everything moves and glides with a maniacal genius hidden in it. The vocals are the only acqired taste, though; Johnny Morrows apopcalyptic indecipherable screams will curdle your blood and make your hair stand on end- he's that scary. Anyway, buy this if you love doom\crust\stoner metal, and stay the hell away if you don't know anything. Cheers."
5,"Must have Beethoven works, well recorded","I highly recommend these two CD's, especially at this price. Vox Box has some excellent recordings, such as this one. If you always thought there was more to Beethoven's symphonic repertoire than his symphonies and overtures, you were right. His incidental music is awesome. I LOVE the Turkish March from the Ruins of Athens, almost a symphonic equivalent of Mozart's Rondo alla turca. While my favorite recording of the Egmont overture remains Kurt Masur, these recordings are also very good, and the sound from the 1970's is still fresh."
2,Absolutely awful...,"This book is really only worth one star, but it got two only due to the fact that it is so much better than its sequel. The art is very cluttered and drab, the script horrible, corny and with many grammatical mistakes. The artists seemed to have a lot of trouble drawing the Odan-Urr character. The plot is stupid and pointless, the characters uninteresting, and too much time is wasted on plot points which really have no consequence. The Jedi are kinda wimpy whiners, and their lightsaber external power supplies were silly. The Sith were a bunch of stupid, bickering idiots, as were Jori and Gav, who desperately need to get a life.This is one of the very worst SW comics available on the market, and I recommend that you stay away from it."
3,Fair Book,Golden Age of the Sith is not the best Star Wars comic I have read. I recomend it to any Star Wars fan who wants to learn more about the Sith.
3,Nice cool drink - but not like Frappucino,"I love cappucino and in the summer frappucino. Based on the reviews I read here, I was tempted into trying these because they were much less expensive than Frappucino. they do NOT, however, taste the same or anything like it.These have a much stronger coffee taste. They would do in a coffee fix crunch - but I didn't find them to be anything I'd buy again."
4,Solid dvd,"This video contained just what I was looking for. I study a different martial art, but was interested in Wing Chun. I got this video to learn some of the basics and it does a great job explaining them."
1,youve got to be kidding,i have no idea what everyone else is taking about but this has to be one of the most over rated cheap and useless vidios ive ever seen
1,Go to a studio,You are not going to learn kung fu by watching a DVD. Spend the cash and go learn it from a professional; proper technique has to be learned from the start in order for a student to progress.
5,Wonderful Adventure!,I haven't read this book since I was very little. Perhaps 7 or 10. I remember getting it from the Troll Book Order club! Oh i couldn't wait to take it home. It came during summer as that was the last book order of the year. Oh i opened it up and could NOT put it down. It was so cute. Its about a witch that greets two girls and they go on adventures in the neighborhood on a pink bathmat. the witch flies upside down. Its a wonderfully charming story. I can't remember it all. i am 33 and I havent seen this book in years! I do recommend it! it's harmless and very sweet.
5,Excellent reference,"Easy to read and comprehend the basics of ""ZONE"" for living healthy and sugar free. All of the recipes I have made are delicious, and use products that are readily available in the supermarket. I cook a few meals on the weekend, and then have a lovely meal prepared when I get home from work."
1,Not impressed with these recipes.,The book arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. These recipes seem to have been developed by either someone who seldom cooks or has no imagination. It is not that difficult to stay within the Zone and still be a little creative. Better off experimenting on your own!
3,Somewhat Disappointed,Recipes in this book are not too exciting. The medical information in Sears books are always good and the book has some redeeming value because of it. I just wasn't pleased with the recipes at all. I regret purchasing the book. Should have checked it out of the library instead....
2,Book is OK,The best thing about this book is not the recipes themselves. It's the chapter on how to pick everyday ready-to-eat items found in grocery stores that will work on the Zone diet.
2,Well...I'm not sure about seconds....,"...because each recipe I've looked at so far all take at least an hour for prep time and cook time. And I'm not talking about all the ingredients your meant to compile...I'm sure the author means well, but these recipes are fairly complicated, and I am an accomplished cook. I can see where they would turn off someone who is not too keen in the kitchen. Also, each recipe is for four servings! What to do if I'm the only one on the diet?Luckily, I also bought ZonePerfect by Kristi Walker. Her recipes are for one and even come with pictures! Hooray!"
1,yuck,"The recipies in this book are so bland. Not only that, they are a lot of work for ONE serving of food! I really hoped to find some Zone cassarole type of food that could be reheated throughout the week. There is nothing like that. I made a meat stew that was practically inedible. For breakfast they had me using a food processor just to mash up some blueberries, which didn't make the dish taste any different than just using whole blueberries--but created a lot more stuff to wash! Most of the breakfasts are either omelets or yogurt & cottage cheese with different combinations of fruit and nuts. Big whoop.This book was a waste of money!"
4,Steamy!,"I liked the fact that they showed the realistic side of an affair...both the good and the bad. I also liked how they showed their interactions progress from one night stand to an actual relationship. Lots flof steamy sex scenes, however, it doesnt take away from the film. Chris Messina is hot :)"
1,The Five Million Dollar Book,"I think this book might be a tad overpriced. It must be really, really, really good. Really. (needed four more words to get to twenty)"
2,"Good item, listed incorrectly.","This DVD set did not contain the collectible sleeve pictured. Chobits is a great series, and I highly recommend it to anyone who will listen long enough, but I would not recommend buying this set from this listing unless you want to be disappointed."
3,Warm account of a cold dilemma,"The Test is a journalist's first-person account of what it means to live at risk for Huntington's Disease. The everyday experience of hundreds of thousands, it is difficult for most people to imagine, and Jean Berera has done well in humanizing what media usually sell as unimaginable. The difficulties that HD brings to relationships within a family are thoughtfully addressed. I didn't give this book a higher rating because I disapprove of the author's (or editor's) decision not to disclose his gene status until the end of the book, using it as a kind of nonfictional plot device. In my reading, the suspense that this decision inevitably promoted detracted from the author's thoughtful reflections."
2,What a bloody mess...,"As a diehard fan of 'Torchwood', Captain Jack Harkness, and John Barrowman, I found 'Miracle Day' to be a monotonous mess of a... whatever it was. I don't think even its writers and producers know what it was supposed to be. Were they trying for sci-fi/horror? Drama? Allegory?The only interesting piece of the whole thing was the fleshing out of Jack's character with a failed romance in his past. But even then, the writers had a terrific opportunity to connect it more clearly and importantly with the main plot, and they just screwed it up so terribly.And might I mention that Mekhi Phifer is just terrible? How he got a role in this project is beyond me. (Well, not really--thank you, Starz!)'Miracle Day' isn't worth owning. If you're a collector who hasn't completed his collection yet, stop with 'Children of Earth' and pretend that this bad excuse of a miniseries (which should have been half as long) never happened."
5,Torchwood is one of the best sci-fi series,"I loved Torchwood before and now with Mekhi Phifer, I believe it will continue to push its boundaries. You can take nothing for granted in this series. It can be heartbreaking and relentless."
1,"This is the way the world ends,Not with a bang but a whimper.","Torchwood: Miracle Day starts off with such promise. The first episode is undoubtedly the best by far and you keep waiting patiently through all the episodes for them to get back to that quality, but it never does. Sure they have you trying to figure it out only to do an end-run via flash backs to sneak in the answer around ep 7&8. Anyone who has ever taken a writing class can tell you this is a cheat.The miniseries does pose some great philosophical and social questions but they are buried in a boring drawn out story. This Mini would have been better even shorter. It's like they stretched a 4 part miniseries into 10. Dear Mr Davies, remember sometimes less is more.I do hope there is another series, which allows the show to redeem itself, because it would be sad to end with a whimper like this"
1,Crap,"The cast is fine, story is fine, but when there is more gay scenes then show its a little off putting. So anyway, one star it is..."
2,Doesn't fulfill the mission that is Torchwood,"I agree with those who say this was off target. The only thing that made it Torchwood was the name. Jack and Gwen were background characters in an American show. How anyone who has enjoyed the previous 3 series likes this as Torchwood is beyond my understanding. It doesn't have the Torchwood feel.The best way to understand what I mean would be to watch the previous seasons. Even watching only Children of Earth would give an idea of what Torchwood's mission is suppose to be about. It's hard to believe the writers of Miracle Day ever watched the previous shows. If you are a true Torchwood fan, don't waste your money if you haven't seen Miracle day previously. Find a way to see it before choosing to buy it."
4,Good Story,"I wish Amazon would add close captioned to their steaming choices, NetFlix in general has close caption, needed by all as people that don't hear well. Torchwood is a great series just wish I could hear ( or read) more of what is said."
3,Previous Series are much much better,"Product was instantly streamed perfectly.Series however was disappointingCompletely different caliber of writing/directing than previous series.Lost its ""BBC"" quality feel."
5,A New Twist in Torchwood: Miracle Day,This is a great series - a modern day Dr. Who with a twist of the X-Files thrown in. An interesting evolution of the Torchwood theme occurs in Miracle Day with the new but unanticipated involvement (or interference?) of the CIA.My only negative would be that the ten episodes in Season 4 are the last. No plans appear to be in the works for a Season 5.
2,Just Terrible,I have never seen a series goes from being great to abysmal so quickly. The script is dreadful. Captain Jack looks as if he can't say his stupid dialogue fast enough so he can retreat to the Kraft Table.
4,Good watch,"This season was not as good as the past ones have been. Even though the season was abbreviated, it was not spell binding as the past seasons have been. It is still a good show, just not up to the stellar shows in the past. Actors are still enthralling."
1,Spoilers!,To begin with the discs arrived with scratches. What I was able to watch was very boring. And with the star and the clown that made it beginning every episode with spoilers it just is not worth the money. Of course with all the skipping caused by the damaged discs I did not see it all. Maybe a lucky merciful break.
3,not bad,"The box says to drink daily but I have only had it a handful of times in the past 3 weeks. I felt no effect at all however my husband said it relaxes him and helps him sleep better. Neither of us have felt any change in our ""personal"" lives. The taste is nice and very light."
4,The Last Pure Black Metal Band,Gorgoroth may have released the last true Black Metal album. With departure of bands like Emperor Darkthrone and Mayhem and with bands like Satyricon and Enslaved changing their sound Gorgoroth continues to make pure Black Metal
3,"Good, but fails to compare to the old","First of all, a big FU to all of you Jesus loving, mainstream SOB's such as the previous reviewer. Satan will come and he will have your soul, count on it. Where is your god now??? Anyway, the standout songs on this album are Procreating Satan and Teeth Grinding. The others are just mediocre. Under the Sign of Hell will forever be their best album, and this could possibly be their worst, but still, in no way, is it bad. This is still 100X better than any of the mainstream crap you will hear on the radio or see on MTV. Hail to your dark side."
5,Jack Liffey Survives!,Thank goodness it's not Jack Liffey that's terminal! Here's a wonderful new book that takes us back to Jack's hometown. We even get to meet a family member of his that he's hidden up to now. It's almost impossible to put this book down once you start it. Be warned!
5,Good book to understand Rand and objectivism,A lot of great quotes and interesting info about Rand and objectivism. Gets to the spirit of her work!
2,For Objectivists Who Need To Be Told What To Think,"There are only two reasons to buy this book. If you are an Objectivist you can save yourself a lot of time and money by simply looking up the idea or issue for which you have no opinion and Rand and her grovelling ""intellectual heir"", Leonard Peikoff, will provide you with the appropriate one. From then on anyone who challenges you can be referred to as a collectivist, a communist, a fascist or superstitious and you will walk away from all arguments with a feeling of superiority. The second reason to buy this book is if you are studying psuedo-philosophies and cults of the 20th Century and want one book about Objectivism to reference. For the second reason I give this book two stars."
4,"Not as good as the first, but better than the second...","This wasn't as good as the first in the series, but it was a little better than the second. I know the author has already completed the series, so this is a moot point, but she really, really needed to get away from the virgin theme. In the first story, it was believable; in the rest, it's just a major roll-your-eyes distraction and makes the story just that much more unbelievable. The plot, characterization, and pacing was better in this one than the last, but the relationship between the hero and heroine still wasn't near as developed or believable as in Mackenzie's Mountain, unfortunately. The tension and action made up for it enough for me to give it one more star that I would have otherwise, though."
5,Great Nora Roberts book.,"I read all of these books separately before purchasing the book that contained all three books in the trilogy. This book contains the books Daring to Dream, Holding the Dream and Finding the Dream. I will read these books over and over again."
2,Don't Care...,"I ordered this book for my kids school project, even though I am a voracious reader, I don't care to know anything about mad man's crazy ideologies. But I digress, book order came fast as expected, which in typical fashion of teenager told me when the project was due in few days, so paid extra for 2 day shipping, and got it in 2 days."
5,A memorable read,"In my late 20s, I traveled solo to Indonesia. The day I arrived in Denpasar, Bali, I fell ill with fever, possibly a reaction to a typhoid shot. I took a jitney to Ubud (paid 10x the going rate, what the hell, it was my first day there) and lucked into a cheap bungalow. For the first three days, I did nothing but sleep and read this book. And I loved it, the characters, the exotic locale, the politics, it all comes together beautifully. I read it again several years later and it was still good, even when not having those weird fever dreams."
2,misleading! requires leappad!,This was a great deal..however I did not know it requires a leappad learning system to work ($60). No where in the description does it say that it needs the system to work. My twins (4) are very disappointed. We're hoping to find one at a local child's resale shop.....
2,Weird,"As I said above, weird. Oh, it is witty in some places, but the wit does not overhelm the weirdness. I still cannot decide weather I deplore this book or like it."
3,A one sitting read,"Why is this a one sitting read? Because if you set the book down you're apt to not pick it up again. Translation: it took me more than one start to finish the book. That is not to say that the book is all bad. Rather, some of the humor is delightful, even if read multiple times. For example, the attempt to reconstruct Mouldwarpian language has a glossary: ""dead end: a place where corpses were taken"" or ""fibre optic: a coarse material woven out of eyes, worn by the high priests of the mechanical age in order to instil terror among the populace.""Unfortunately, the life of the orator Plato, which plays off the Greek Plato's cave image, is not sufficiently interesting to cause this reader to care in the slightest what happens to him. Which is not to say that much does.Shall we said the conceit of this well-in-the-future allegory on our times could sustain a short story or perhaps even a short novella. But it doesn't sustain a novel."
3,"Full of very useful information, but a bit redundant.","Noguchi approaches the grammar topic in a very systematic way touching on many pros and cons to its instruction. At times, however, he gets a little trapped saying the same thing over and over which seems to take away from some other, less-developed pedagogy pertaining to this topic. Anyone interested in the 'grammar debate' will find this book full of theoretical and practical information, but they also check anything out by Mina Shaughnessy."
2,"right stuff, wrong provider","I ordered electrode gel to provide conductivity for my heart monitor's chest strap. this is a very large tube, one I cannot imagine exhausting even with daily use. However the tube came with a brochure from an adult sex toys shop and website. fortunately I was able to toss the brochure before my wife saw it. I dread what may be coming in my snail mail as a result of this purchase"
4,Good,I used it on my tens unit an it made the electrodes about 3 times stronger an the pads stickier
1,Too wordy,"The book seriously suffers from wordiness and repetitivness, this book can be sumed up with a few sentences."
5,"Eek the Cat on DVD, Please!!","Many people have been wishing and hoping that Eek would be released on DVD for years, so make them happy! I wish Eek the Cat would be released on DVD in 2009 or 2010, whichever comes first. Please release Eek the Cat on DVD, with no stalling!"
3,Cheap looking but functional,"These really look cheap in person, so if you are wearing these for a fashion statement, I suggest looking elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you are wearing them as slippers around the house like I am, then they are just fine. I actually like these better than the adidas brand (which I used to own) because the adidas ones have a smooth spot on the heel that displays their logo. My problem with this it that the heel is one of the spots that most benefits from the 'accupressure' spots. These sandals have the nubbly texture all over the sole. I like them."
5,"Right on the mark,.......","Professor Farron's book is packed with real-life examples and official policies of how 'Affirmative Action'- or as it is called, cloaked in it's new moniker, 'Diversity'- has had discriminatory effects on people like me who happen not to be 'a person of color'. His clear descriptive quote on Diversity and its subsequent effect is so full of self evident truth that the quote alone is worth buying AND reading the whole book:""Diversity is the most insidious and pernicious of all defenses of discrimination. The other justifications assume that discrimination is a necessary evil, a temporary expedient that is needed to produce a society in which race and ethnicity are irrelevant. Diversity assumes that discrimination is an unqualified good and that it should be perpetual.""I recommend this book to all, even 'people of color'- whatever that may mean!"
2,Better read another book or 2...,"This book barely covered half the questions I had on my exam today, besides the incorrect information presented. There were in-depth questions on USB configuration, Domain permissions, proxy server usage, plus the expected setup and network issues. I'm getting the MS Resource Kit tomorrow!"
3,Not too Bad,Superb acting although the plot is a little boring. The story tells about how one man can make the dreams of eight mentally retarded people come true. Act the play of Cosi. END
2,my item is damaged!,Hi i dont have a problem with th seller or the movie its great! its just that the case is cracked at the top on both sides and bent at the bottom can i get another one?
1,"Schubert Complete Piano Sonatas: Walter Klien, pianist","Volume 3, CD 2 is apparently identical to Volume 2, CD 1 according to the information my computer provided when I inserted the CDs. Actually, the music is different for these two CDs, with the exception that the last two tracks on these two CDs are identical. It is not possible to decide what one is listening to, since the music does not match the descriptions. Walter Klien is an excellent pianist; the recordings are of high quality -- what a shame that the labeling is messed up!"
3,good quotes,i thought it would be more technique based. but it is mostly wordage. found some good quotes throughout.
4,Pretty Good!,"Let's see... I had a friend who was murdered. I had no way to say goodbye to my dear friend, she was true and good, she left behind her two-year old son and husband. She was the last person I would've thought would get shot in her own home, it is unbelievable. There's no way to make sense of it. This book has some great insights, great ways of thinking. I never knew I could hurt so much, and I've been looking to see what people have to say about such tragedies. I'm not particularly religious, this book is good if you aren't into god, or even if you are, you can take what you want from it's passages, it has helped me. If you are going through grief, sometimes you won't want to deal with your it, I know that it is soul-crushing, and I feel your pain. But if you have a moment, in your stronger moments, in moments of repose and reflection, pick it up once in awhile, it can help."
4,"Must Reading If You Have ""Religious Issues""","When many of us were small, we were told that God is both all-powerful and all-loving. It makes sense, even to a child, that one or the other chacteristics makes sense, but not both simultaneously. God could be all-powerful and then phenomena such as earthquakes, cancer and AIDS would be ""divine retribution."" OR, God could be all-loving but not all-powerful, in which case S/He could only grieve along with us when these tragedies occur.It is Kushner's great insight to see that people who are caught in tragic circumstances not of their own making usually get stuck in some version of the same dilemma above. Patiently, and with great wisdom, he sorts through issues of God and grace. I'm a Protestant but I got more out of this book than years of Sunday School. ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"" may be a little oversimplified in places but it's a great place to start--especially if you're mad at God!"
3,God - a silent spectator?,"Herold Kushner's WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE has almost the same questions that I had had in my mind when I lost my beloved wife a year ago in an accident, when she was hardly 28. I found this life very cruel, ruthless, and totally meaningless. As long as sufferings prevail in this world, God has no role to play here. Only those who do not know what a suffering is in reality, and those who fear of losing their fortune (whatever little they have), end up prasing Him ""Kind & Loving"". Kushner's attempt to protect God even amidst the unexplainable sufferings amounts to ridiculing the pains of a sufferer. While I don't endorse H.K's ""God-protecting"" views, I respect him for his daring questions about sufferings and God's role as a lame-duck/silent spectator."
2,When Bad Books Are Written By Good People,"Rabbi Kushner is a fantastic communicator, and this book does not disappoint in that respect. The problem I have is with Kushner's solution to the problem of evil. He resorts to Aristotle's view of viewing God as impotent. This contradicts the Kalam Cosmological Argument as well as the Ontological Argument for the existence of God. It also contradicts many passages in the Tanakh.Jeremiah 32:27 ""I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?Jeremiah 32:17 ""Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you.Genesis 18:13-14 Then the LORD said to Abraham, ""Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' (14) Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.""The book may be comforting, but it is unbiblical, and it offers little hope that God will one day overcome evil."
5,When Bad Things Happen to Good People,Excellent! I gave this book to my sister who lost her granddaughter to cancer and she said it provided the most help of all. Thanks so much.
1,Don't give this as a gradutation gift.,"I was given this book as a graduation gift. Not only was I insulted; I was forced to READ IT!!AHHH!!!THE AGONYI felt like I was back in preschool having a old lady tell me how to be a ""good little boy"".Kushner here's some advice for you:Bad things happen to everybody,except when they happen to an SOByou think they deserve it."
5,When Bad Things Happen to Good People,"Harold Kushner is an excellent author. This audio cd is excellent to listen to in your car or when you are alone and too tired to read. It is so touching and real, you will want to listen time and time again, just to keep things in perspective, especially in this day and age of tragedy."
4,Very much worth a read,"Although I do not share Kushner's Jewish belief system, he asks the same questions we all have. Why? Why me? Why now? etc. While his presuppositions are different from mine as an evangelical Christian, I still think he lays out some worthy bones to chew on, making you think through your personal theology and ideas of who God is and just why it is that bad things happen to good people. Another book readers might want to look at is C.S. Lewis' 1940 work entitled The Problem of Pain. A comparison of the two authors, one Jewish and the other a Christian, might interest some who take this issue very seriously and are willing to stretch their own viewpoints."
5,A classic,"I've heard about this book for years... so often that I felt as though I had already read it. I imagined that I knew the book from what others said it was about. I read it a few months ago for the first time and I was deeply impressed. Rabbi Kushner's reflections are theologically solid and mature AND accessible. That's such a rare combination. If you haven't read it yet, do."
4,"A Good Perspective on Why Bad Things Happen to Good People and How to Handle it When They Do, As They Inevitably Will...","A serious yet sensitive look the age-old question of ""why bad things happen to good people,"" and ""what to do"" when they do happen, sending aftershocks and fallout throughout our lives.Reading this book won't keep bad things from happening to you and to those you love, but it will help you keep those bad things in perspective and focus when the do happen as they inevitably will. Life has to go on, in spite of the bad things, and this book delves into what has to happen for that to be possible.Great Sunday School read for those classes who want to ""think""--which few do--to think about and ponder the difference between what we say we beleive and what we really beleive.Better to read this book BEFORE the bad things happen than after, but even then, it could prove to be a great help in keeping perspective and moving forward to what comes next in life."
4,Great Packing Job,THe books arrived in great condition. I ws jsut a little suprised at how long they took to arrive but other then that all was well.
4,Needs to be reissued,"This is a an absolutely great dvd as far as the performances go. Unfortunately, the video quality is quite poor. The picture is often faded (the VHS copy has more color) and the sound quality is also pretty bad. It would be really great if BBC decided to reissue this set with better attention to video and audio quality as they did in Elizabeth R. I know that I would re-purchase the set if they reissued it."
5,BRILLIANT TV SERIES,"I am very interested in anything regarding english king Henry VIII because apparently my family in in relations with his third wife Jane Seymour. I remember watching this series when it was shown on TV and I can say it is fantastic! Brilliant acting,directing,atmosphere and costumes, make us relive that exciting era. There is a shorter version as tv movie, but the only way to go is the whole series preferably on DVD!"
3,Bad German accents,"I thought this was OK but have a few reservations about the actresses who played his wives. The woman who played Catherine of Aragon was not very believable and over-acted way too much when she screamed histrionically at being told of Henry's intention to divorce her. And the actors who played the German Cleves family (Duke and two daughters Anna and Amelia) had the most ridiculous accents, which only distracted from the drama. I doubt Ann of Cleves was as stupid as they portrayed her, but in this miniseries she comes across as almost mentally retarded."
4,Good but there could be more,"I wish there was more in this book about script formats and script notes then just what's funny and what's not. Many good points are made but the examples are outdated and focus on shows from the 70's and 80's, which may be tough for a younger reader to relate."
2,What a bunch of drivel - the reviews below that is!!!,"I never realized there are so many experts about the Regiment...and not one of them having served a day in their lives! What a bunch of panzies!This video is just one of many, produced by some nitwit wanting to make a buck. So what the heck does it matter what it's like? It's drivel.For or against, all of your reviews are nonesense!Good grief...you'll be asking each other what colour the boat house is next!"
3,Abit touchy feely for me,Seems to list some older research to justify the approach suggested and not include newer research that may not agree with that approach. I don't think the examples of peoples experience helps a great deal but may help fill out the book. I would have liked the book to be a little more practical. That said I think it was a helpful book for people who have already decided to take the approach suggested in the book.
5,Book Review Excerpts,"""Gaca's book makes a valuable contribution to the history of sexual ethics in antiquity and will be indispensable reading for all scholars and students interested in that topic.""--Virginia Burrus, Jrnl of Early Christian Stds""Gaca's ability to navigate confidently across both the Greek philosophical tradition and the Septuagint is as rare as it is valuable. An eye-opener."" --Kate Cooper, Times Literary Supplement (TLS), 5 November 2004, p. 14""Rich. . . .Gaca's detailed analysis of the several traditions, and her incorporation of the Septuagint, NT, and Philo in the argument, mark a significant advance over Foucault's analysis in The History of Sexuality. Indispensable to future research on the subject and should be in every university library.""--David Konstan, Religious Studies Review""With lucidity and a sustained examination of a synthetic Christian ethical concept, Gaca's fine book supplements social histories...""--P.W. Wakefield, Choice: Current Reviews For Academic Libraries"
2,So excited for a toy that my dogs won't rip up.,Overall the material is good but it was no match for my dogs. I have a 8 month old German Shephard and a 4 year old Boston Terrier. My German Shephard got a hold of the frisbee first and ripped the edge off. I figured this product would be much harder for my dogs to tear up than other toys but that is just not the case. I am dissappointed that it lasted less than a day when it was implied that it would last much longer.
5,"Harold Blumenfeld: ""Rilke for Voice & Guitar""","This CD set includes ""Rilke for Voice & Guitar"" by Harold Blumenfeld. The composer submits this review of the work by Donal Henahan in the New York Times. ""In Harold Blumenfeld's austerely beautiful 'Rilke', a cycle of three songs, soprano Rosalind Rees sang superbly, with a dulcet tone, unusual attention to dynamic subtleties, and flawless pitch. The songs, with the guitar softening contemporary asperities that a piano sometimes exaggerates, made their lonely, pained point with the utmost precision. The guitarist, David Starobin, performed with exemplary technique and great sensitivity as accompanist."""
5,Be Brave.,During the storm scene while Jay and Daisy's Ma was reading the scripture from the bible Daisy was clinging on too her Pa Jay was praying and there Pa was holding onto Daisy so tight .They made it through the horrid storm without breaking a single bone or without getting hurt even though the storm wrecked there house they were just glad God blessed them with a miracle .Like it said on the ad a story with laughter and faith.
4,Invaluable Russian Fiction,"I loved this book, it is so unique. Please--do not pick up this book and expect it to be like any other collection of short stories you've ever read. It includes 23 short stories and 13 extended monologues that are touching and insightful. They capture the heart of what it's like to be living in communist Russia in each of these stories (which of course, focus more on just living there). There is no parallel that I can think of to match this award-winning book for Americans, so I suggest purchasing it if you can find it, it is very poignant and informative."
4,RUTLAND FIREPLACE GLASS CLEANER,I use a heavy duty wet paper towel with some of this product. I rub it on and can see the residue on the glass come off on the paper towel. Turn the towel to a clean area . Apply another dob of product to the towel and clean another section of the glass. Continue this process until all the galss is clean. Then wipe it with a clean wet cloth followed by a clean dry cloth. It works quite well.
2,"NOT a murder ""mystery"" as such","If you are thinking about watching this movie, just be aware that it is NOT a murder ""mystery"" as such. Unfortunately, I got it thinking it was more of an Agatha Christie type story, and spent the entire time trying to figure out who really ""done it."" I was very disappointed when the typical twists and turns of a true mystery didn't materialize.If my expectations had been different, I might have enjoyed this movie more. The set design was superb, as was most of the acting and the dialog (although, without subtitles, the British accent was a bit difficult for me to understand at times). But, on the other hand, I might have been disappointed anyway, since the story is somewhat disjointed and I never bought into the relationships between the characters (the two mismatched lovers, the husband and wife, the wife and 'companion' etc.)The story might have been true, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie."
4,Sultan's Kitchen,"Very comprehensive book. Would have liked to see more photo's, always good to see how it's supposed to look. All in all a very informative cook book for turkish cooking."
5,Exciting odd time funk grooves in an improvisational format.,"This CD is an excellent introduction to Steve Coleman's musical brew. If you enjoy heavily percussive jazz with fun drumming; then this CD is for you. Gene Lake is outstanding as well as Steve, Reggie and everyone else. I recommend all of Steve's albums especially if you are a drummer, percussionist, or a contemporary progressive Jazz fan. Two Sticks Up!"
1,Never Even Turned On!,Received this product in the mail this afternoon. Could not even get the power to come on. Called tech support and they recommended returning it to Amazon.Update - over a week later I still haven't gotten a refund (expected but still annoying). I needed the drive ASAP so I ordered a Seagate FreeAgent. It worked right out of the box and is very quiet. It also has a 5 year warranty. So far so good...
2,Very Nice External Drive!,"This drive works great and is a bit slimmer than most models I have seen. The Sata capability really makes a huge difference in speed if your computer has a free external Sata port. If not, the drive comes with an adapter to turn an internal Sata port into an external with a faceplate that attaches in an empty PCI opening.Very fast and very functional!UPDATE: Shortly after warranty period expired the control board failed. I had to remove the drive and scrap the case. I bought a replacement external case (with no hard drive) and placed the drive in the empty case."
2,13 Months Then DEAD,"If you plan to use the drive as a backup, DON'T. It has been running fine for about a year now and then all of a sudden it started having problems... When turned on it would show up (USB) for an instant then go away and would repeat this for possibly 5 minutes. Eventually it would calm down and either be available or not until I power cycled it and the whole thing would start over again. The point of this is at under a hundred bucks you get what you pay for. It was a good backup until about a week ago. If you plan on using the drive as a ""working"" drive and you don't mind a failure (e.g. you've got everything on it backed-up) then caveat emptor!"
1,Barron's is Bull,"The book is pretty much useless. The one thing that will come in handy is its dictionary. The questions are badly written and confusing, and the answers don't actually vary very much. The reasons given for the answers tend to be little more than saying ""The author implies -repeats multiple choice answer-"""
1,Barron's AP ENglish worthless,"a la Conan O'Brien (in the year two thou-sand)I used this book. Read all the books in the class, a ton of poetry analyzed, what did it get me? A 3. Didn't even get credit at my U for it.This book (7 edition) is worthless. Just make sure the morning anouncements aren't blaring during exam time, like they were when I took it, and you should get &#62; 3.Also, get sleep the night b4, and stay really sharp during the reading of the passages for the multiple choice. If you can't understand the passage, move on to the next one fast and come back to the one you skipped after you've built some confidence with the others.good luck"
2,Can't use this camera with Windows NT,"Great camera other than the fact that you can't get your pictures onto a computer that has Windows NT. For Windows 2000, I believe a driver is available but there is now photo editing software support."
1,Beware with this camera or buy insurance,"I only had this camera for a couple of weeks before it died. I called Polaroid and they told me to send it back to them. That was additional cost to me. I was using the camera for Ebay which means I am unable to sell anything while Polaroid had my camera. I called today to inquire when I was going to get my camera back. They knew the model number before I even told them who I was. I had TWO Polaroid agents tell me that they have a lot of problems with this camera. If you do buy this camera, it does the job if you just want to put pictures on the internet. Is it worth the trouble worrying if it is going to break?"
5,Excellent service,The book is in the shape it was described and the shipping is very quick. Excellent service
4,Great textbook,"I'm a student in 9th grade. I once hated math with a passion, and would often take my anger out on the textbook. However, I realized it was the teacher who was not explaining, not the textbook. So, I bought this textbook and the Geometry textbook by the same author and taught myself the subject. I read, did the problems, and can honestly tell you I have a clear understanding of Geometry and the Algebra 2 I have learned so far. The textbook has many real-life applications and examples to help someone learn the subject on a personal basis. This textbook has made me love math."
5,"ONE OF OUR FAVORITE ""GUILTY PLEASURES""","THIS MID-'60'S FARCE PLAYS LIKE A SIT-COM: LUCKLESS REALTOR HOPE GETS HIS WIRES CROSSED AND WINDS UP ACCUSED OF MURDERING BLONDE BOMBSHELL SOMMER. HILARIOUS WISECRACKING DIALOG BETWEEN HOPE AND DILLER KEEPS THIS FILM ROLLING. IF FOR NOTHING ELSE, WATCH FOR THE OUTRAGEOUSLY HUGE HAIRSTYLES SPORTED BY SOMMER AND CO-STAR MARJORIE LORD. ALSO RECOMMENDED: ""EIGHT ON THE LAM"" WITH BOB HOPE, PHYLLIS DILLER, & JONATHON WINTERS."
1,"Yes, movies were this bad back in the 60's.","If you think the movies they are making today are bad, watch this one and you will soon understand that they have made bad movies for years. Horrible acting, dumb jokes, and a lame script. It's true, Bob Hope really was a pretty bad actor and his jokes were as cornball as an episode of Hee Haw. Now Elke Summer- easy on the eyes, so she almost redeems the picture. But not quite. Oh, and did I tell you the sound is in mono, lol. Another interesting point taken away from this movie is you see where 2 1/2 men got it's ideas from and where Charlie Sheen got his comedic style from- Bob Hope. Even the housekeeper that doesn't do anything except put down jokes and handing him another drink."
1,This is not the product in the picture,"The picture that you see in the ad is NOT what you will receive. Its definitely a bait and switch manuver. What you will receive is a cheap inflatable (who knows how durable) floaty. Sure doesn't look like that in the picture does it?If this happened very many times with Amazon I would quit shopping here.PS, you have to rate your item in order to submit a review....there were no zeros so I had to put in a 1 but I wish I could put in a NEGATIVE number!"
1,Boring,"I had hoped this book would have had great insights into a real rock band with great songs, but instead we get this lame repeating story about guys who (omigod!) have sex with girls! And it gets worse, sometimes they drink and even take drugs! In one crazy story, they went to a bar, and stayed really really late! It gets sad when you read on, how they love masturbating to porn. Picture the dumbest kid in high school trying to sound like he was older/mature.As to the insights about their music and concerts, Mr. Manning claims he forgot all that stuff?"
4,I passed with this book,"I have taken the EIT twice. The first time I was single with loads of study time and I used the Lindeburgh book. I failed the exam. The second time, I had limited study time unless I wanted to stay up till wee hours of the morning, which is hard with a young child. I got this book based on other reviews that it covered the basics in a user-friendly format. I was not disappointed. It was easy to follow, and although I studied for 6 months prior to the exam, I was able to maximize the 2 hours a day that I spent.And the most important part - I passed the exam!!"
5,Fundamentals of Engineering by Dilworth et al.,"This is an excellent book for the Fundamentals of Engineeringmorning and afternoon session (General Engineering). It hasoutstanding coverage of electrical circuitry and higher math-particularly differential equations. The coverage of thermois comprehensive. There are many good problems in statics,dynamics and fluids engineering. This work should cover mostof the material you'll need for the FE examination. I wouldrecommend studying the areas you know first and then spendingthe remainder of the time on weak areas. If time permits,hammer away at all the areas in the weeks preceeding the exam.Some of the official publications of NCEES contain good problemsets which frequently appear on present and future exams."
4,Good practice problems.,"I found two or three mistakes, but overall it provides an efficient way to review and practice the subjects covered on the FE exam. I highly recommend this book."
1,Overrates Monty Python's importance way too much,"This book claims that Monty Python inspired SNL (Saturday Night Live). Only slightly true. SNL's biggest inspiration was Rowan and Martin's Laugh In and even the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (both from before 1969 when Python started). Also, book claims Python inspired comedian Richard Pryor. Huh? Pryor had his own succesful comedy routine in the 1960's before 1969. Also, this book talks about not everyone liking Python as though those that don't are few in number. Probably more folks in the USA over 12 years of age don't like Python than do."
5,Kaplan PN,This is a excellent book which will help you develop stragegies when taking the NCLEX exam
3,Could have been much better.,"A few nuggets but I was disappointed. I was really looking forward to this book because of how much I liked E-Dogs book (Making the Final Table). It was not boring but there was a lot of puff and it is a short book. If you play a lot of NL cash games, then I would give it a read. If you have not read any NL cash game books or you only play tournaments then I would pass. Sklansky and Miller have a new cash game book if you want to learn the technically side of NL cash games. Also Super System 2 has a great section for NL Holdem.If your looking for chip tricks, I would recommend Rich Ferguson's video."
5,Heinrich von Biber,"In all the baroque era of music, I must confess, my favorite is Johann Pachelbe. BUT! Of anyone who come as cloce to Pachelbel, that would be von Biber. His is a very elektrifying performance and so very lovely to hear. Between Pachelbel and von Biber, they are the best of the baroque... With the acceptional addition of Antonio Vivaldi. VIVA LA BAROQUE!!"
5,If Your'e Reading This You're on the Verge of Hearing a Great Singer,"I think Carolyn Currie is one of the best ""unknown"" singers around. You almost certainly won't find her music in the ""big box"" or chain music stores. Though I'm not particulary qualified to be a music critic, I have been a big fan of folk, ballad and Celtic music for decades. Ms Currie's voice is uniquely beautiful-- rich and sensual, yet also a perfect match for the sad/haunting songs that predominate her work (and I can also strongly recommend her earlier CDs: ""No Heroes"" and ""Standing Stones""). She writes her own music and the lyrics are particularly poetic and often very moving. Aside from the the great ""3 Lady J's"" of folk music (i.e. Joan Baez, Judy Collins and Joanie Mitchell), Carolyn Currie is my favorite female singer."
5,Go Jason,My work cd always use to play Jason Mraz songs. I decided to buy the live cd instead of the studio cd because I enjoy live music better. I agree with the one review about the teenyboppers. I hate screamers. They ruin great shows... But what can you do. You can download a bunch of Jason live shows at http://www.archive.org/audio/etree.php peace n love -ash-
2,Don't expect comedy,"I saw this years ago and still can't forget how dismal and disappointing it was. While I understand actors want to stretch themselves and not always take on the same roles, anyone looking for a lighthearted comedy won't find it here. I don't agree it's gentle or heartwarming, although I'm obviously in the minority here. This isn't funny, it's merely drama and not especially quality drama either. I believe I donated it to Goodwill; hopefully someone with different tastes found it a good deal."
3,Useful,"This was useful for students who say, ""I'm done, now what."" It provides practice that is interesting and challenging, not just repetitive."
1,over 7 years and she hasn't finished the trilogy,I warn you not to buy this book becuase the story has yet to be completed. Very frustrating.I actually bought this book back in the middle of 2001. I couldn't wait for the next book. I loved it. Finally the 2nd book comes out in 2002 and I loved that one too. The problem is that it leaves you hanging. Where is the 3rd and final book in the trilogy? I wrote the author a few years back and she said it was coming.I say you should wait for book 3 to come out and then buy them all.
5,"Entertaining, Educational, Valuable","I absolutely loved this book from the first page. It's highly relevant to pretty much everyone, and has great examples put into situational context. Tannen does a wonderful job of providing clear, understandable information, in a witty and entertaining tone. This book helps the reader to understand how sometimes what we assume to be horrible misunderstandings are simply differences in how we communicate; even the slightest gesture can come across all wrong, and spiral a conversation out of control. After reading this book, I am much more aware, and this awareness has given me a curiosity to discover the communication styles of all my friends and family (probably much to their chagrin). It's a great read, both entertaining and useful, and I would highly recommend it."
3,Not the best recording of this.,"I much prefer the two Naxos-label recordings of Geminiani's Concerti Grossi. This recording seems a little slow and less inspired. But this one has Opus 2, 3, and 4, while Naxos has 2, 3, and 7."
1,Try to buy the original version!,"This version of this very beautiful story is totally ruined by explanations! It constantly explains what apartheid in South Africa was all about - as though the viewer was born yesterday! Talk about hitting the viewer over the head! Pathetic! Do yourself a favor and don't buy this version. If you can't find the orignal, read the book! Margaret"
5,A beautiful adaptation of a beautiful book,"I don't always like adaptations of books, but this version of Cry, the Beloved Country was beautiful. Although portions of the book were changed/left out, the spirit of the book remained intact in this movie version. I love the soundtrack, the montages, and the setting. It really brought the book to life in a powerful way."
3,Could be better,My chief complaint for this product is that it needs to be 3-4 inches longer. It took a lot of stretching to secure it completely but it did work....it's just a chore to secure it.
1,"Good product, sucky price","I made some delicious mozzarella chesse with these bad boys. They worked perfectly and arrived lickety split. However, I suggest you not buy these online unless you have absolutely exhausted your search locally. about a month after I ordered these I found the same product for $1.99 in my grocery store. It was in the section with the pudding mix. Also might be in the baking aisle. After shipping and everything, this box cost me almost 4 times more ordering it online. Just a word to the wise, grocery stores will order products upon request, so you might go that route if you don't need it immediately. Just a thought"
1,Too much sex and not enough substance,"But I guess that is what gay men want to read. As a Muslim, I was really hoping for more insight on Islam and homosexuality. Instead it's just the tales (many of which, the author notes in the introduction, are fake) of an oversexed man and his sex life. Probably most American gay men who have ethnic fetishes will find the book titilating, he does go into great detail of his sex life (ex. seducing the servents in his home, sex on vacation, when he moves to San Francisco). I on the other hand wish there was more to it than that."
4,A Tosca MUST,"With the many Tosca's available these days,this version still outshines most others...Zeani sings splendidly; with passion, intimacy, and involvement...Herlea is terrific- his voice matches that of a Zancanaro or Wixell any day...Cavaradossi is not Zeani's or Herlea's equal, but he pulls off a convincing portrayal and is never ""incorrect""...at this price- GET IT !"
4,Realism and Magic can get too mixed up,"It is pure, classic Rushdie, and therefore a delight to read! However, in the middle of the story, the occasional prosaic references to the real can appear to be out of place, imposed. On the other hand, some of the mundane narratives (that are not too ridiculous to be untrue, especially in the context of the region's recent history) are not so easy to separate from pure fantasy, unless one is very familiar with all the characters and their personal histories. But perhaps that's where lies the author's trademark. Buyers should be aware of the fact that the recent Picador edition is annoyingly full of typographical/editorial errors. Hopefully these will be taken care of in future imprints."
3,A customer's review,"Salman Rushdie wrote an intriguing novel when he wrote shame. There are several plays on the definition and the combinations of shame in this novel. Through his humourous personal commentary, glimpses of a larger political agenda can be seen coated with sarcasm. Overall, the book was not bad, although a little unclear at times. The reader should have background knowledge of the situation in Pakistan to help see the the comparisons of the characters to influentual people."
4,The Mario Vargas Llosa segment,"Vargas Llosa appears a month and one half after 9/11 and speaks against fanaticism and terrorism. He spokes about Peru's struggle against terrorist groups and about the U.S. action in Afghanistan against the Taliban. He has come however to speak about a new book of his based on the life the dictator Trujillo. He speaks of the great role Dictatorship has had in Latin America and his hope for a process of democratization there. He also speaks about his own writing and his involvement in the political and cultural realms. The interview is informative but Vargas Llosa speaks English in a quite pained and difficult way. He also despite being a writer of considerable reputation does not converse easily, or show great humor or wit.Therefore an informative interview but not an especially entertaining one."
4,Body Glove Scuba II Case for Motorola RAZR V3 - Black / Silver,"I did extensive research on cases for the razr. This one was rated well by others - and it is great. It is a lot slimmer than I expected it to be. My only concern was that when the phone is open, the case at the phone's hinge is floppy."
3,Fits too loose,"I've had other body glove phone cases but this one does note fit as snug as others for the razr, also is difficult to charge the phone with the case on it keeps on loosing contact because the hole is too small and the material too thick."
2,Not recommended,My worry buying this sight unseen was that it would not fit correctly. My fear was realized. The case does not allow the phone to close completely flush. I am looking for a new case I can try on first before I buy.
1,Body Glove Scuba Case for Motorola RAZR V3 - Black,"Nice idea, bad implementation. I tried to put it on my Razr, and as soon as I started sliding it on, it tore. The second one did the same thing. I gave up on them."
4,what I expected,"The Scuba II case for the MOTO RAZR is a good solid option to protect your nice phone. This case claims water resistance and is made of a rubberized material that seems to be very durable and protective. There is a plastic cover for both the internal and external display along with a plastic cover for the number part of the keypad. The belt clip for the case is well built and the case allows for normal closure of the phone flip lid. The slim profile of the RAZR is still preserved and only a little bit of bulk is added from the case. I won't lie... I gave the case a 4 star because the phone looks so much sweeter without the case... but I want my phone to be protected. Also, the cut-out for the USB mini jack (for charging and connection to a computer) is a little bit misaligned."
5,Great Product,"So it doesn't quite fit the charger plug -- just stretch the material to expose the outlet and the charger connects easily. Love the feel, great protection for the phone. Great product! Product received in minimum time. Highly recommend product and dealer."
4,I like it,"This cover is just what I was looking for. It fits great. I can leave it on all the time while taking pictures, charging, etc. I had a different cover at first that I had to remove for pictures. I haven't found a con yet. And it looks good too."
3,Once you put the phone it don't take it out.,It started to stretch after taking the phone out to clean it a few times. Now the top part of the cover will cover the earpiece and cut off the sound when I open the phone. It's ok as long as you remember that. Otherwise you will think your phone is not working or you can't adjust the volume loud enough. I hold the cover down with my finger when I'm using it.
1,Not worth a nickel...,I threw this thing in the gabarge as soon as I unwrapped it. It looks like it came from the dollar store.
1,DISAPPOINTED,"WHEN I CLICKED THE ITEM TO MOVE IT TO MY CART, THE PRICE WAS 15.44CHECKING THE CHARGE ON MY CREDIT CARD REVEALED THAT I'VE BEEN CHARGED 29.61WRITING ABOUT IT TO AMAZON DIDN'T HELP.AS FOR THE DVD ITSELF, THE COLLECTION OF THE SONGS IS REALLY FANTASTIC, BUT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE CLIP OR THE SOUND.VERY SHALLOW"
1,Good product,But what the heck happened to the price? I can see paying 24.00 but not 59. What in the world would precipitate a more than 100% increase in less than a month.
5,Annie meets the Godfather,"This is easily my favorite Stallone movie. It isn't a musical (thank God, Sly tried to sing in Rhinestone), but it has the same feel as Annie. A blend of slapstick confusion with a little ""who's on first"" type humor makes for a most enjoyable family movie."
4,Funny movie!,"I saw this movie for the first time many years ago, and it still keeps me laughing! To this day, I can't hear/see the word oxymoron without thinking of the line ""You're an ox and a moron!"" Although Sylverster Stallone is better known for his action roles, I've never enjoyed him more than as the mobster who's trying to go straight while also dealing with the craziness surrounding him. This movie has an outstanding supporting cast (especially Chazz Palminteri and Tim Curry) who pull off all the craziness like pros. It may not be the most sophisticated movie ever, but it is one of the funniest, if you don't mind a few cliches. Definitely worth watching!"
4,Great Movie,"With a great cast, funny topic and dialogue, this movie makes for a 90 minutes delight. Stallone, and his co-actors deliver in this movie like never before. A good buy."
1,My iPod Mini died with less than 5 months' usage,"My iPod Mini died with less than 5 month's usage. It simply refused to turn on; refused to charge; and would not be recognized by my PC after docking via a USB port.This is the 3rd time that this occurred. The first two times, I was able to reset my Mini. This time, no such luck.I owned a 3rd generation iPod. That thing was a clunker and had horrendous battery capacity, but I had no such technical difficulties as described above with my Mini.I also own an iPod nano. But that's just too new for me to recognize any problems. I hope I have better luck with the nano.Depending on how Apple treats me with my Mini with the warranty service and how the nano performs, I may STOP buying Apple MP3 players and trade onto a iRiver player."
2,"ONLY ONE PULL NOT ""SET of 4""","Very appealing for set of four but much less appealing at eleven bucks a piece. Get rid of the ""Set of 4"" unless seller genuinely is attempting to deceive the buyer ... hmmmmm. Purchased then returned."
3,review of the end of north korea,"korean peninsula was politically partitioned in 1950's korean war. korean war is often seen as democracy vs. communism, yet it is more correct to say christianity vs. non-christianity. us millitary was sent to korean peninsula to convert korean peninsula to christianity peninsula. all other wars that us millitary was involved in were from amreicans' desire to realize christianity world.as long as christianity and related religions exist tragedies never end."
4,it could have been better.,"the action was difficult to followdue to director attempting to make scenes very dark and forboding.The sex scenes were pretty rawand kind of took on a life of theirown.The character developement was average with what appeared to be anhonest attempt to get the audience to sympathize with the hero and his girl friend.The special effects were very goodand probably are what helped carrythis movie through some of the justbarely tolerable dialogue.I felt that it was as a whole agood attempt but with alittle better direction could have beena muchbetter film.But still worth watching for fansof sex,violence,and the sci figenre.4-3-11 this movie is now readily available on a double disc and blue ray from amazon. have not watched either version as i have a older dvd version that i bought years ago from a dealer overseas."
5,An Essential Reference for All Ages,"For those of us who are aging and for our children who need to know how to deal with it (and us), this is a superb reference to every aspect of growing older. It is comprehensive, with a wealth of additional resources; it is infinitely readable; and--best of all--the author understands and addresses the psychological as well as the physiological and logistical problems of aging and dealing with older relatives and friends. It belongs on the shelf next to the dictionary in every home--if, that is, you can put it down long enough to place it on a shelf. Buy one for yourself and one for each of your children--and then tell all your friends about it."
2,Warranty? We don't need no stinkin warranty,"I bought I version of this TV from a local big box retailer (the KP46WT510). 2 years and 11 days later, the covergence amplifiers blew out. Result, $400 repair, because it was 11 days out of warranty. If you must buy this TV, make sure to figure in the cost of at least a 3 year extended warranty with in-home servce."
4,elegant fun,"These cabinets knobs are beautifully cast and lend an elegant tone to my kitchen -- but, because theyare vegetables, there's a touch of fun, too. I can't believe the change they made in the look of my cabinets."
4,the real bukowski?,"The man seen in these journal entries is devoid of the bravado of the character he created, real or mythic, in the body of his work.There is a great deal of commentary on the writing process and the PC as a catalyst. Although this inisde look at the writer is not one of his stronger efforts, there are still moments when the words sing, and yes that nasty bit of nihilism that he managed to hold on to till the end."
5,pirate figurines,"The pirate figurines are durable, well made and are depicted well.I used these on a pirate ship cake and they are exactly what I needed to show action. I would purchase this product again should the need arise."
4,Not His Usual But....,"I do feel this is a lil musical gem. If you think it's elevator music then all I can say is you're not listening. Go to a Jazz club in any major city and you'll ""get"" what Prince is up to here. It's about the music, and the textures in music, not about what sells. This is Prince singing a love song to his art form, not to the ""fans"" and the record labels.I respect this.Doesn't mean I am not going to like Purple Rain any less now, but I can dig this too...I think a lot of people make the mistake of expecting an artist to do the same basic thing all the time. When he or she doesn't folks don't know what to think and because it's not what they are used to they trash it.This is pure Jazz...No, it's not your typical Prince funk but it's GOOD for the genre and there is nothing wrong with Prince going into it. He does it well, so why not?Morrighan"
1,'NEWS' is no new news,"There are now 4 PRINCE albums that [are bad] to me. 'LOVESEXY','GRAFITI BRIDGE','RAVE...' and now 'NEWS'. North,East,West,South is the meaning to 'NEWS',no lyrics,each song 14 minutes long. MADHOUSE was better than this (remember MADHOUSE? PRINCE's experiment to jazz?). I hate dissing my favorite artist since I was 13 (I'm 36 now) but if I'm buying trash,I'm letting it be known."
2,they aren't songs.,"It isn't bad... It just is kinda' rambling. This is obviously just a series of jam/screwing around sessions that are being packaged as songs. Again, it is interesting and isn't bad, they just aren't songs."
1,Horrid Recording,"I know this is inexpensive, but it's no bargain. The recording is ancient -- no depth or dimension, and appears to be in mono (even though the cover says ""stereophonic""). The heart of the piece, the choir, comes across as a hissy, sheet of indistinct voices. This is NOT a 1996 recording (in fact, there is no recording date listed). Buyer beware!!"
5,The Search for Nefertiti,"After I watched Nefertiti Resurrected on the Discovery channel I hoped that this book would be wrote. when I received my copy I did not want to put it down until i finished it. The author brought the 18th dynsity alive. You got to know the people and how thay lived and what that may have felt about the change in there lives . Great book, for anybody who loves history, even if you don't think it was Nefertiti's Mummy that was found.V. Cambron"
4,great cards,I've already bought these cards. Now I bought them for a friend and she liked them a lot. So great
5,Roommates,"This and The Cutting Edge are D B's best movies. They are excellent. I have owned them for many years as well as quite a few of his other movies. I watched roommates this morning for the first time in a few years. I had tears in my eyes as it neared the end. D.B. is truly an excellent actor, he talks in a way that indicates he is really enthused about what he is doing. These two movies are keepers. I wish he would make more movies!"
1,Don't buy,The hinges looked great but when I received them they were flawed. There was no way I could use them being so out of line. Sent them back for a refund.
1,Weasel Review,"Two kids, Molly and Nathan Fowler, walk throught the woods with a stranger named Ezra to find their pa caught in a bear trap. He was captured by a man named Weasel. Waesel had taken his gun. They take him to Ezra's cabin. The next day Nathan had to walk home to feed the animals. When he got there they were all dead. On the way back to Ezra's house he was caught by weasel."
2,Weasel,This book was a very interesting book. It had alot of adventure in this book that i really liked and thoght it was very interesting. I learned alot from this book and thought it was a okay book. I liked this book and wish to read another one like this.
1,Not for elementery school,I was shocked when my 10 year old 4th grader was telling me about this book they were listening to (on tape) in school. When he was telling me details about the book I decided to look the book up online. I am so upset. The acts performed in this book are disturbing. I would not recommend any child read this before high school.
1,Parody? No.,"Initially, this video seems like a skit from Saturday Night Live. The ""professors"" are paradies of themselves, and I've seen better acting from 2nd grade students. The video is boring and dated. And if I was bored with it, I can only imagine how much my eighth-graders would have been turned off. I would have given it ""no-stars"" but that wasn't an option. Other than that, it was fine."
4,Emeril's fry pans,"Emeril's fry pans are very good to cook with. The only thing Icritisize is, that the non stick surface lasts only approx. one year, although I never use metallic tools."
2,From NON STICK to STICKY,"Though this pan seems well designed, ..., this pan has become the stickiest! When simply making scrambled eggs the entire pan becomes covered with a thin layer of egg, that after the pan cools is very hard to remove. I have used oil on the pan prior to putting the eggs in, but the same thing happens. ..."
5,A must-have for any household with children,"This video brings the beauty of the book to life with beautifully illustrated animation. A poetic story of a fisherman and his beloved cat who save the village from going hungry one Christmas. This is an absolute must-have for anyone with younger children, cat lovers, or anyone who wishes for a sweet, poignant story of friendship, love, and sacrifice."
1,Disappointing,"Although purportedly a book of scholarship, it is not. The author criticizes alternative theories of Jesus from the presupposition that his own understanding of Jesus is the only valid one. He does not attempt to justify his own position, simply assumes to be a defender of the ""real' Jesus, while supporting orthodox Christian doctrine at the same time. He is oblivious to the obvious truth that the intellectual bankruptcy of conventional Christian doctrine leads people to search for new explanations of Jesus. Those who share his preconceptions will enjoy this read. Others will not."
5,The best I have read!!,"This book is very very good!! But I dont recomened it for someone under the age of 13. It is filled with suspence and passion, love and hate, innocence and, well, you have to read it. im not going to tell you the story!!"
1,Horrible Printer,"This is a terrible printer. I've never seen any piece of equipment that takes so long to get going - anytime you do ANYTHING (even just changing the cartridge), it rolls the cartridges back and forth multiple times, rolls the paper bar, etc. etc. until you finally turn it off and try again. It takes a good 5 minutes for the stupid cartridges to center and stop rolling so you can change them. Plus, it goes through a color cartridge before you've even printed what would be a roll of film. To top if off - the quality is poor - the colors are NEVER right. Look elsewhere for a better printer"
3,Not so great printer,"Bought this machine a day ago, am returning it, it is insconsistent in the quality it prints, it eats ink, and pictures are good, no great, but acceptable.Sounds like it is going to self destruct when it is working. I bought it because I thought I could use it directly wiht my smart media cards, I can, only problem is, the results, again, not so great, the software leaves much to be desired, I,ll stay with HP again."
4,Excellent for the Price!!!,"I have used all the top name brand printers. For home use this is an excellent printer. The colors are vibrant and if using photo paper the print is better than expected. I recommend this printer and Epson paper products. If you compare the quality of Epson products with other brands, you will see the difference and be more than pleased."
1,Doesn't fit Nokia,"I purchased this item for my Nokia 5100 series phone and was disappointed to find that it didn't work at all. The adapter seemed to fit snuggly to the phone, but the 2.5mm jack popped slightly in and out of the adapter so it couldn't hold a connection. I was never able to hear the person calling me to test it. Nokia owners, save yourself the shipping to send it back."
3,Great idea - quality?,"I'm on the phone a lot for business and this is great for leaving your hands free to take notes, drive, whatever. The only problem is that the reel and earpiece don't hold up. I'm getting ready to buy my fourth one the last eighteen months."
5,This woman and her band can really put on a outstanding show,"This CD is my personal favorite. Every song is powerful and moving, and It will have you feet pounding on the floor and have you ready to get up and ( from one of her song)... shake your rump! If you go see her in concert be prepared to stand up and want to dance. Both times I've seen her perform, groups of people are dancing. In one song she mentions her age, and this Cd shows that age has not slowed her, and for a woman of her age, (Sorry KoKo) she can easily perform as well or better than women half her age. I recommend this Cd with 5 stars because if you like the blues you will love this CD!"
4,Other Applications!,"I work with adults who have cognitive deficits, and this game has gone over well. The photographed animals make it seem less childish, and they open up conversation about pets, farms, and zoos. Great purchase!"
2,Not very literal,"If you are buying this as a direct delivery of the meaning of Dante's lines then you are wasting your money. At every turn, the hollanders seem to favour their own stale paraphrasing and apish poetry over, of all people Dante Alighieri's. Small bits of sentences cut or added, new words not in the original used here and there. After a short while it all gets very irritating for the student looking for a work that delivers a literal translation of the original as promised in the introduction."
5,Innovative!!!,"This movie is innovative! A lead actor with Down-Syndrome,(Evan is such a lovely young man!),passionate cast and crew with love for this project! 100 Monkeys created the score so don`t miss it!You didn`t need a lot of money to tell a great story..."
1,Oops!!!,"Whoops, were did the market go? People will say and believe anything when the economy is booming, but what now? We are on the brink of a recession, and people like this have their tails between their legs. Dow 100,000: Fact or Fiction, I think the answer to that question is the only certainty in these economic conditions."
1,What a difference a year makes...,"What pompous reviews by reviewers whom time has shown to be clueless idiots. And the book is of course rubbish.""this excellent book explains, in essential terms, why markets rise AND why they fall""""In a succinct and convincing manner, Kadlec summarizes the history of how the market is affected by such a policy mix.""""This book is a rare treat because it's written with a deep knowledge and appreciation of supply-side economics""""And Kadlec performs an invaluable service for investors when he questions the prevailing myth of market irrationality and ""bubbles."" Markets fall, he suggests, not because participants suddenly become irrational, but because they're burdened with irrational policies.""Yeah, right. How many people have lost money reading this garbage?"
5,our wedding cake toppers - AWESOME!,"I bought these for our wedding four days before the reception, we didn't have a bride and groom for the top of the cake. I decided to use these. They were delivered on time, in perfect condition and perfect size for the cake toppers! Me and my husband have a little inside joke about jack and sally so it was perfect for us. Now we have 'em on display in the living room of our house. They are a pretty fragile so I don't recommend actually playing with them. But super cute decorations =)"
2,Not the best for action...,"To be honest, you learn A LOT from this DVD in the direction of where the Z soldiers are going.Piccolo decides to fuse with Kami-Sama, Gokou leaves his home so the androids won't track him, and Buruma learns of another Time Machine!However, like many DBZ episodes, there's a lot of 'wasting' time in the animation. Lots of panning out and panning in. If you're into animation, this is NOT for you. If you love the DBZ stories, then this MIGHT be for you... what I find quite annoying is that they have to have 3 episodes in order to get from one place to another, whereas they could've done it all in one episode!Kurirrin again proves to be the guy with all the knowledge! Which is great - I love this character. But then you've got Vegeta who's annoyed he isn't the strongest guy in the universe so he goes on his usual rant...nothing we haven't seen before."
4,androids attack,I thought this video was cool but not as good as assassins.I love seeing Vegeta and Trunks as a super saiyans.I also liked the scene where Vegeta stood in the rain.Doesn't contain much fighting but still cool
1,Don't bother,"Although I thouroughly enjoyed the 1st book in the series, Dragonsbane, I would have preferred that I had not bothered with the next 2, DragonShadow & this. I doubt I'll bother with the next and there has to be a next - this one stops with out even coming close to answering any of the questions it raises. I'm afraid I no longer even CARE if everyone dies as is implied. If you MUST read it, borrow it from the library & don't waste your money on this disjointed, painful half book. By the time it was finished (and I use that term only because there were no more pages) I was hoping they would just kill off all the people in the book to get the torture over with. I am (or should I say was) a fan of Ms. Hambly but doubt I will bother in the future."
2,A tedius journey to destruction,"In this latest battle of our heroes, John and Jenny Aversin and the dragon Morkeleb vs. assorted really rotten demons, John finds himself in an alternate universe that resembles New York city taken to ridiculous extremes. The idea that a primitive man, even though brilliant, could function in such a strange environment seems farfetched. Close attention to detail is required in reading this work because things move so fast. The demons have the upper hand turning usual concepts on their heads. Don't expect a happy ending."
2,More of the same,"Those who were disappointed by the exceedingly sombre tone of this book's predecessor, Dragonshadow, will find this book more of the same. The ending, a cliffhanger, is disappointing; I would advise waiting on this until the next one is out, and then reading them both.Hambly has handled breaks between books with more grace: the touch of hope at the end of The Silent Tower, where Joanna betrays Antryg believing him to be something other than he was, but then redeeming herself by guessing the right password to the computer, or the transitions between The Time of the Dark, or in the Rainbow Abyss, where Rhion leaps into the Void but at least the reader knows that he survives.This is just a grim little cliffhanger of an ending. Wait for the sequel."
2,Mild support,This product is well manufactured and durable. It is for someone that only needs slight support. The plastic insert if flexible and serves little function.
4,Interesting and Informative,"Lindgren's ""WPT Making the Final Table"" provides in-depth insight into his style of tournament play. With many tournament strategy poker books out now, most of them provide very similar messages. Lindgren's book is no different. The message being: PLAY AGGRESSIVE!! and GATHER CHIPS EARLY ON! However, what makes this book special is not his ability to convey this message but with some of his additional sections, he helps prepare you for actually putting the money to good use and how to avoid paying more taxes than you need to. I recommend this book to any novice player getting ready for tournament play."
3,Just not that impressed.,I'm a true bigginer in airbrushing and I bought this book along with two others and this one just isn't very impressive. Its about as thick as a thick magazine and it really doesn't go into much detail. I only paid $3 for it used so i DO think I got my monies worth. I'm not dissapointed just not impressed. Could be because the other two books i ordered were just so much better. Big Book of airbrushing and Complete Studio Handbook. Most impressed by the Complete Studio Handbook from my beginners perspective.
4,Great Sheet For the Money,"Washes well. Does not shrink. Makes for a perfect ""guest"" sheet. I am pleaseed with the product."
3,Decent with some MAJOR problems,"If you haven't seen these then you don't know yet, but Funimation has changed EVERY SINGLE VOICE! All of them are different. Unfortunetly they are all also really bad. To make things worse the quality of the language used has also gone down hill. The only reason this got 3 stars is because it's Dragonball. It should get two or less if it were any other show. I suggest watching or buying the subtitled versions. Or even better learn Japanese, at least they don't randomly change the voice actors!"
4,"I loved it,But the voices arent that good.",This is a big step for fans that never saw it. Goku is the strongest. I loved it. and you will to .See how it all unfolds see how goku turns to a super sayin. If you dont start getting the tapes youll be sorry.
2,get the subtitled versoin you will do your self a big favor,"the subtitled version is way better, the sound effects could be better. I am a big dragon ball z fan and I am disapointed, voices aren't that great, expensive"
4,About time!,"Finally subtitled Dragonball Z is in the United States (except the three movies of course). Now the otaku of America can stop searching through fansub sites trying to get some decent Dragonball. This video isn't so great in itself, but in what it gives us. I think people should be treated to hearing what the voices are supposed to sound like. Goku is supposed to have a high-pitched monkeylike voice. Kaio-sama (King Kai) is supposed to have a deep, serious voice until he starts acting goofy. Vegeta is supposed to have a more regal voice than his tough-guy one in the dub. All I can say is I can't wait till the Super Saiyan episode is released on DVD. I've heard the scream from when Goku first goes Super Saiyan, and no dubbing will ever repeat it. One last note, I like that the subtitles change to fit the names (such as Kuririn, Yamucha, Muten Roshi, etc.) rather than the subtitled movies when they kept the names the same as the dub, though anyone with ears can hear different names said."
1,BLEEEHHHH,"MY GOD... The only way this could be worse is if they were still painting over the blood. EVERYTHING bad from the first 2 seasons are still here. HORRIBLE voices, droning emotionless music, and (the worst thing of all) CHEESY DIALOG. I mean stuff like ""I'm so strong because I eat healthy foods!"" and ""Well I hope you like my fist, because you're going to be eating it!"" DO NOT buy this crap. If you need your DBZ fix, get the manga by Viz, it is uncut, faithfully translated, and just great."
3,"Does the job, until it fails","One of these chargers came with our Canon EOS digital camera and worked great for a couple years. After a while ourCANON EOS D10 Lithium-Ion Battery 1200 mAh (BP511)seemed to be losing its charge so we bought a new battery. Same problem with that one. Ultimately we bought a newCanon CB-5L Battery Charger for BP511-BP535 Series Batteriesand it turned out the charger was the problem.The moral of the story is, don't always blame the battery. If your batteries are failing it might be the charger."
3,It works,"This works fine as a charger. The flashing system is easy to understand. My only complaint is how light it is. It's really thin plastic that would crunch if you ever stepped on it. It's just a charger, though. It does what it's supposed to do."
2,WhaT no instructions?,When I received the battery charger I expected it to work the same as the Canon charger of the same number I got with my Digital Rebel Camera. When I connected a BP511A battery pack. the indicator light turned from green to red. On the orriginal charger the red light flashed in three stages to give an indication of the battery charge state. In the new charger the light is a constant red untill it turns green when the battery charged. This made me think that the product was defective but I am not sure. The fact that the product is dispatched without paperwork or instructions is the reason for the two star rating.
3,An OK indie,"The story was OK. There were some funny moments. There were some intersting statements made on relationships and finding ones true self, but I've seen better indies."
5,"Worship at Red Rocks, a blessing from God.","John Tesh is a man after God's own heart. His love for God comes through on this recording, as will yours as you listen and sing along. ""You Are Good"" was recommended by Chritina Rasch and Prima Tesh, a great song to celebrate God's goodness. Enjoy both exhuberant praise and awesome reverent worship with all of your favorite contemporary Christian songs. If you liked ""Worship"" by Michael W. Smith, then you will love ""Worship at Red Rocks""."
2,Waste of Money,I bought the Blu-Ray version hoping for a great performance with excellent audio and video quality. What I got was a lackluster performance with poor audio and just average video. The KOL have great potential but the songs and musicianship need drastic improvement.
5,Kings of Leon,"I bought this for my son . I am an old hippie rocker from the 70's , but I must say I watched this with him and was quite impressed . They have unique sound and all play together well . I don't like todays music in general but this is an exception . These young guys from Jackson Mississippi sound awesome . The video quality is superb and the sound is great as well . I would highly reccommend this DVD to all music fans wether you are 65 or 12 years old ."
2,A great collection - but a misfire.,"This 3 disc collection of 40 works by Gottschalk has it's pluses, and unfortunately it's minuses. The pluses include the large number of works presented in a single collection, and at an unbeatable price. On the minus side, we are presented with performances which abound with wrong notes, some of which are very excessive and plain irritating (especially ""The Union""). Alan Mandel is obviously a fine pianist, and he is well recorded, but either was not given the benefit of multiple takes, or the VOX company elected to release his recordings without editing. After listening to these discs you will agree there is a case to be made for ""multiple takes/splicing/editing"" to produce the best recording possible. I cannot understand why the VOX label would release these recordings in this manner."
5,Superb work,"Mandel captures Gottschalk completely in this work. Every work is detailed well. I play much of Gottschalk, and Mandel's interpretation's are done to near perfection. I would dismiss the two previous reviewer's who talked about 'wrong note's' and other garbage, obviously reviewed by musical simpletons. I highly recommed this cd."
5,The review on the salmon swimming at another hit.,"Leftoversalmons record ""EUHORIA"" is the BEST salmon cd ever on a scale of 1-10 i give it a 12 if you even havent heard of them before get it just to know you have the best this one couldnt be better."
4,Very Fast,The installation was pretty easy. The software - B's Clip and B's Recorder took some getting used to but worked fine once I got the hang of it. I went to the Sony homepage and downloaded the latest revisions to the software - The site had good instructions and the update went smooth.I burned a couple of music CD's then saved some files on a data CD. I'm very happy with this burner. Make sure you buy high speed blank CD's because this recorder is very fast.
1,WORST Meat Grinder EVER!,"WORST Meat Grinder EVER! Does NOT grind. I use the blade with the largest holes, but it still clogs up right away. MOST USELESS item -- I WISH I could return this"
4,Perfect for venison,"Use once a year to grind my deer meat. Does all that is expected. You have to feed solid meat in individaul 1"" pieces for best cutting. Don't try to jam load. This is not for commercial or high speed usage. Other than that, it's a good unit for the price."
1,It does not handle dynamic disks,"And forget about technical support. You will keep exchanging messages with a program. If you get past the mail format, email adress consistency problems etc. you may be able to exchange messages with a human. I gave up after the 4th automated response said they will look at the problem."
4,BEAUTIFUL!,"As a Frenchwoman who spent last summer touring the Loire and its chateaux, I was a bit disappointed in this book. Had I wanted a book about French history, I would have bought a book about French history. I was looking for a lot more of the ""now"" and a lot less of the ""then."" The old black and white photos may delight some, but I found them a major disappointment. The chateaux, as they are today, are a glorious feast for the eyes; more up-to-date photos would have garnered this book five stars as far as I'm concerned. But all that aside, it is a lovely, over-sized coffee table book and one that should be ""required reading"" for anyone anticipating a visit to the Loire."
1,Not soothing,"There was no description when I bought this, but the cover looked very peaceful and serene. Wrong. Upbeat music, fast scenery changes, and odd little maps every so often in the corner to show where the footage came from. Might be useful as a travel lure, but not of any use if you want to sleep!"
1,Coca-Cola Commercial Songs: Super More,"I was so excited when I found this cd. Upon it's arrival, I noticed Japanese writing on the back of the label. Upon playing, all songs are sung in Japanese. I found no information indicating this at the time of my purchase."
3,Don't be an an absentee or permissive parent,"That's about all you really need to know. This book goes off in tangents that I don't agree with looking for examples, and doesn't lay out the examples of bad parenting behaviours, and how to correct them, in a structured manner. It all just flows so you would have to read every page of the book to find what you want. A lot of repetition too; the book could be cut in half. Even the Afterword: What Every Parent Needs to Know is not put together all that well. Maybe it's because it is written by an academic instead of street-level."
5,raise a child you can like,"it's too hard to try to fix things when kids are teens - children are NOT running the show and, believe me, they are disgusted by adults who let them.. they are terrified of having that much power. As much as they love getting what they want more often, they hate knowing they achieve it the wrong way - and they know it doesn't work with the rest of the world, which is Most Everybody Else except just 2 people: a weak mom and stupid dad.if you want your child's future husband or wife to like you, read this book! if you don't want your child to blame YOU for everything wrong in his or her life [and selfishly they WILL... and they won't be wrong, either!], read this book..."
1,Beauty & The Disaster,"What more can I say? The movie is absolutely hilarious as a comedy. The acting was beyond believable....over the top dripping with cheese. It's even more hilarious when you watch it with the director's commentary. It's hard to believe the director was proud of this film. However, the landscaping and mansion were breathtaking. :p"
5,A must for any intellectual cook,"This is a beautifully photographed book and a great adjunct to anyone who has, or is presently reading Proust, or just interested in the Belle Epoque or reading Edith Wharton etc."
1,"Great Performer, Horrible DVD","Previouslly I gave this item a good review. Well upon receiving it I must retract my earlier statements. The quality of this DVD is horrible. It looks like it came straight from youtube and off of a computer screen. The description says Rosie O'Donnell part 2. I thought it mean the whole Lena part from 1998 and that part one was her appearance from 1997. It leaves out her singing Stormy Weather, her last television appearance singing. And skips to the interview part. This is not an official DVD. I hope Blue Note or somebody will put Lena's Gap Commercial and both of her entire Rosie Appearances on DVD oneday, on a nice clear transfer. Don't buy this unless you are desperate to have something on Lena."
5,very pleased,"i hadnt ordered toys from amazon before, but knew the company (gund) very well and I knew what i was looking for, and this was exactly it!!! it was a gift for my brand new nephew and it was perfect!! I got the product in a very timely fashion and was very pleased with the condition. i had never purchased from this seller before, but I certainly would in the future. I gave this entire transaction five stars and continue to be very happy with all of the products ive ordered from amazon over the years."
5,Best Conform Toy,"I received this dog as a present when my son was 6 months old. He took to it right away. It has become his comfort object since then and he is now 17 months old. As a parent, I love the fact that it is machine washable!!! We have several as backup in case they get dirty and we travel with them everywhere!!! I highly recommend this product."
1,Grade school overview,"This is a VERY simple overview of French food. No recipes. No cooking demonstrations. Tells you things like what a chef is. Maybe 20 minutes long or so. Simply put, it is not a very good deal."
5,beautiful and merry making,"I found this cd in a hallmark store when my son 6 months old, he's 13 now. We listened to it over and over. I lost it and missed it ever since. I usually like only the classics when it comes to christmas music. When new artists cover classics they usally mess them up (I think) but Trisha Yearwood is adds something to the classics and dosent' take anything away. I am not even a country music fan at all. I bought 3 copies of this one for me, one for my mil and one for my sil. You'll love it."
3,Good case,"Looks grest, fits great but hard to get off. Wish it had better protection. I have scratched top off phone because it doesn't cover enough. It's my occasional case."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring Book","We saw this book at a Bed & Breakfast in Monte Vista, CO and since our family was traveling together to Israel in the near future, we knew we all needed to have it. I ordered four copies and we all love this book!"
4,Good soundtrack.,"Great soundtrack like so many others by movie music composers. And like every one else says, it's missing one or two tracks, but that should not be a distraction."
4,Drunken masterpiece.,"Jack Long, and Li Yi Min star as two drunken masters caught up in a war with a band of local masters, and also a love triangle. Amazing fights, good story, and Jack Long Li Yi Min are again a great team. Look for an appearence by Mark ""Ghost face killer"" long as well. Definite must see."
1,Great Introduction to Wilson,"A great introduction for those unfamilliar with Wilson. This is a highly personal look at this complicated, sometimes unlikeable man. Wilson was the most well read man of the 20th century and one of the most honest observers of communism from a mid to far left point of view."
5,All Good,"Best price I could find on this, arrived promptly. Theses are tough arrows do be aware they need to be cut to length"
3,okay for intermediates,"I am an intermediate banjo player,I used this book when I had about 8 songs under my belt and found I needed to play backup. It is decent, gets the job done, has a video with it that is decent too. My favorite backup banjo ( this is ONLY for backup) instructional material is from Accutab and is a dvd called ( I cant remember the exact name) something like 3rd position backup or up the neck backup. Both are similiar, they show an early intermediate player who may know from 4-15 songs how to start playing backup. Banjo players are well known for playing loud obnoxious backup and hopefully these will help reverse that trend(!) The book/dvd is good but not excellent, make sure to get the dvd with it!"
2,ANOTHER BOMB BY RIDLEY!,"What is the deal here Ridley? Ridley Scott's choice of subject matter is going way down hill. He has recently made movie's about ignorant pretty boy sailors tooling about on a schooner, and here he is making a movie about ignorant army dudes tooling about on a female g.i. NO MORE ARMY MOVIES!!!!!!! No more military movies period! We are inundated enough about the horrors of war and anything to do with war!In this film, Ridley Scott makes good use of rain (it seems as though that's his trademark signature) and some of his dark color schemes play out quite nice on the screen. Most of the characters in G.I Jane are quite forgetable unfortunately.One classic scene in this film though! Demi Moore on the verge of collapse, (looking like a tweaked out version of Sinead O'Conner) looks directly into her sergeants face and utters the classic line ""SUCK MY _ _ _ _.It's worth seeing just for that one part."
1,what a waste of money and time.,"Terrible movie. Why would a woman want to be a SEAL?No, I have nothing against women.And why have all the men in in the military be seen as arrogant jerks?I have never had anything against women, and I don't approve of Viggo beat Moore up and then trying to rape her. (Why do that? To teach her a lesson? To not go where men do? To put her back in her place? That is sick. And I don't consider that weedng out people like her to be right. Rape? no way jose')"
3,TREZKU13 needs to check his sources.,"This movie is a good girl power sort of film. TREZKU13 is actually incorrect. My sister just completed SEAR/POW training. They did everything, including the simulated rape. She had black eyes, couldn't talk because they punched her in the throat, even had to kill a rabbit while there with her bare hands. Anyway, yeah, the movie does play on some stereotypes and there are some inaccuracies (i.e. you don't fight back in POW training or you're gone). Overall, it's a decent film."
1,Lasts long...for the first 9 mos.,"At first I thought this battery was great because it had a longer talk-time than the Motorola one. But, where my Motorola battery held its charge consistently over five years of useage, this one lasted less than a year. Even on an overnight charge, this battery goes dead after about three minutes of use. It doesn't fit in the holster either."
5,Complete Idiots Guide To Screenwriting,"Well, Skip Press has done it once more...written a very good descriptive plan for any potential screenwriter to follow. Although he does conflict with a few other similar writers, it's hard to knock his accomplishments. This is an excellent book, easily recommended."
1,I still haven't received it.,Its been over a month and I still have not received my item. Apparently it was lost in the mail. I am very unhappy about this. I will never use amazon again.
4,Excellent,"Embryo were one of the funkier Kruat rock bands. They released numerous albums in the 1970s. We keep on is one of their best.Embryo's distography is varried: at times they mined a stripped down jazz funk. Other times they stuck to these rythms, but added vibraphones, denser arrangements, and avant-gaurde flurishes. We Keep On is this type of record.Out of the band's albums, this is one of thier most realized, with compelling melodies, ear-grabbing textures and detailed arranging. This would be a great place to begin if intersted in prog, Kraut-Prog, or Embryo's extensive catalouge."
3,"Not all are made in the USA, some are made in China","I was profoundly disappointed to see that this all American product is actually made in China. If my wife had not thrown the boxes out already, I would have gone back to Costco and bought the ones from Korea which were a third the price!"
4,accomplished t.v.,"a handy tv for a kid's room or any spot. tape program is too complicated. DVD and TV straight foward and useful. does it all, making extra equipment unneccassary. a good price for what it does."
1,Bad bed,We used this bed 4 times and it failed. It will not hold air. The air valve (inlet) does not seal air leakage. It's the worst air mattress we have ever had.
5,Allosaurus - A Review,"A wonderful video about the Allosaurus. A high quality, well-researched production that will appeal to all ages, expecially from 5 to 55.. I am a middle school science teacher and will use this in the middle school classroom. Yet, the video has become a favorite of my granddaughter (5) and my 7 year old grandson. Purchasers will not be disappointed in this video. HPF, Houston, Texas"
3,"The ""Seventh"" episode of Walking with Dinosaurs","The Ballad of Big Al (also known as ""Allosaurus"") acts as a good add-on to Walking with Dinosaurs (seen it?). Because it's only about 30 minutes, The Ballad of Big Al has alot less killing. The narration, though, is still bad. I wish they had an option to mute the narration."
2,Out of date,"Realize that this is supposed to be a classic, but it was written over one hundred years ago. It is out-of-date and not a user-friendly read. I just gave up on it."
5,Great System!!,"I just got this stroller for a baby shower gift from my parents. I had researched many other systems, and even tryed others out. My sister has a Evenflo system that i used when i was watching her son, and I just didn't like the system. I am very petite- 110 lbs pre-pregnancy, and only 5'3"". My boyfriend is 5'11"", and it is easy for both of us to push the stroller. Everything fits together well and seems very safe.I am 8.5 months pregnant, and cannot wait to bring home my daughter in this car seat!"
5,Should be a Best Seller.,"I think the publishers of this book should create a new dust jacket, change a few pages at the start of the book and take a run at the best seller list with this as a novel. It's really written that well.Meet Dana Carswell, an old timer with a twenty year old candle company, a teenaged son at home (I could say troubled relationship, but with a teenaged son that goes without saying), and starting out a Monday morning of what promises to be Hell Week. The company has just been bought out and the new president tells her they are thinking of going into the personal care business. ""With beeswax,"" Dana answers.Dana is just one of the five different characters as they adjust to new jobs, unfamiliar products, perceived threats and unclear loyalties and the brash new CEO who wants to forge a new path to greatness.Every once in a while one of these little books comes along that while having a lot of fun while opening whole new trains of thought. Wonderful."
5,Very Interesting!,"This is a great book, very well written and extremely interesting. I still recommend this book to friends eventhough I read it years ago"
2,"Boring tales of Ari, Jackie, John, etc.","Not worth reading. Unfortunately the minutia overwhelms a somewhat ridiculous premise -- that Ari had Bobby assasinated in order to marry Jackie... I don't think so ! It ought to be a work of fiction, but it is not even entertaining enough, and usually I love novels about the late unfaithful but charismatic President and his lovely wife."
3,it's a good pot,"Just wanted to tell people that despite the statement ""Stainless steel vessels and lids for lasting beauty"" in the description, this pot DOES NOT come with a lid. I suppose I shouldn't have thought it did, since it's not in the picture... Otherwise it's a great pot. I had the same one before, and it's a standard (until my roommate boiled it dry and forgot about it)"
2,"I really tried, but this one just couldn't hold me!","Maybe it gets better after the first third but this book is remarkably unmemorable and certainly not compelling. Couldn't wait to put it down whenever I picked it up. Lacked tautness or any evocation of real people or other times. Robin Hood's done better in other forums. Still the prose is workmanlike, though lacking in any dazzle. How do some of these books manage to get published? -- Stuart W. Mirsk"

1,"Far from historical, modern or intelligent!","I went into reading this book thinking that I would come out of the whole experience more knowledgeable on, well, the politics of internet commuication... At the end of the first chapter I realized that I had wasted $18.This book is a completely inaccurate accound of internet communication. When in pursuit of a PhD from Mass. Instit. of Technology, I was learned the intriguing mix of politics and the internet.... My career allows me to mix politics, and communication...This book offers nothing new to anyone that watches the news (well maybe not Fox News, but thats a different story) This book merely gave me an ametures view... Dr. Klotz, you should be ashamed for writing this book, and should apologize to both of your readers."
5,Slick,"These scoops are well constructed, a good weight, and are great to use. They've made my ""wouldn't want to live without this"" list. The rounded design makes them especially good for getting dry goods--such as brown sugar and flour-- measured correctly right from the box."
1,all-clad,"Nope, I don't have these but I'd buy them in a second if there was a 1/3 cup. Please make one."
4,Beautiful book of the classical fairy tale.,"I've purchased this book before in hardback but gave a paperback copy as a door prize at a recent club meeting. It is a beautifully illustrated book of the classic ""Red Riding Hood"" story. I own quite a few ""Red Riding Hood"" books and this is my all-time favorite!"
4,"Good price, works great but kids want more!","I purchased the shuffle for my daughter's 13th birthday. She loved it but the first thing I heard was ""it doesn't have a screen"". So I took it off her hands and I love it. It is so light and easy to use. Not to mention how easy it is for a ""mom"" to download songs off of ""itunes"". My daughter pooled the rest of her birthday money to buy the new 1gb ipod Nano. She really loves that, it is a little hard to get her attention now but it is just the small step up she was looking for!"
1,Bad quality,This was a great player until it stopped working. It all of a sudden quit playing out of one earphone.
5,Perfect for kids!,"I bought two of these for my kids (7 & 10) -- they are the perfect size, they don't lose them because it hangs around their necks and it has PLENTY of room for their songs. I download audiobooks for my 7 year old and they both can share my music library (with my permission). No screen to break when they fall out of the car when the door opens and if somehow it does break, it didn't break the bank to buy in the first place!"
1,it sucks,"it works fine for a while,but after a few weeks if you play it too loud the speakers blow out. There's no video display so you have to sit there and keep skipping to find the song you want. Sometimes if you skip to often the thing will shut itself off. If you put in your binder during the school day like i do the headphones will break. Don't waste your money your better of spending the extra $50 on a mini."
1,ipod shuffle is junk,"i bought the ipod shuffle to use as a simple music player when walking. do not buy it; it is simply junk, garbage. in either mode, shuffle or straight playlist mode. the ipod shuffle stops playing completely after 5 to 10 songs. to get it restarted you have to shut it down and reset it. one time even that did not work; i had to reinitialize the whole thing thru the computer software, and then reload all my music---it then played for 8 songs and quit again. the battery was fully charged at all times. Stay away from purchasing this useless music player, it is a royal pain in the neck."
1,broken?,"I purchased an iPod shuffle for my husband for Christmas. After making two additional purchases in an attempt to get the iPOd to work, we went to an Apple store and were told that it was broken (at least we know it wasn't 'just us'. The entire process of dealing with this product has been very frustrating - and costly. The IDEA of it was very appealing - but in reality, we have spent more time than we would have just simply listening to regular old CD""s on a regular old CD player. We haven't contacted the manufacturer yet; hopefully, they will be able to resolve the issue."
1,Doesn't even work,"I bought this item from an Apple store and connected to my computer, however my computer did not recognize the ipod. Went to Apple's online customer support page. Man, the page is flooding with Ipod shuffle breakdowns. This item is the most breakdown-prone unit among ipods. I went back and got my refund. These are not durable and solid players."
1,SORRY SHUFFLE,"IM WRITTING THIS WHILE WAITING FOR ANOTHER ITUNE FIX TO DOWNLOAD,SMALL YES, SIMPLE NO. NOTHING BUT GRIEF SINCE CHRISTMAS WHEN MY GRANDAUGHTER OPENED IT. GOOD LUCK WITH YOURS."
1,My I-Pod is not Working,"I tried all the options in the manual and from the apple web page, but the I-Pod does not respond. I need your advice to return it.Best Regards,Lauri Chin"
4,good starter mp3 - for small kids,"This is one of the most basic MP3 player you can get, and from the leading supplier. Good as a starter and for a small child or for an adult who doens't need 1000 choices. Most important, it works as stated and downloads are fairly painless once you get used to iTunes vernacular."
1,Cannot download files to shuffle.,My family owns 5 different Ipods. Never had a problem with an IPOD until I bought a shuffle. I've only been able to download 1 song to it. Have tried ot on 3 different computers.Checked Apple web site for warranty work. It appears they want $29 to fix it.
3,"Great player, but some big negatives","The iPod shuffle is a great little MP3 player. First I must say I have the iPod mini (which I think is by far the best MP3 player around), but I use my friends' iPod shuffles a lot. I must say for some people buying the iPod shuffle is a great use of their money, but for others it is a total waste of money. The iPod shuffle is for you if you:-like the shuffle mode-want to listen to it when you work out-like to listen to whole CD's, no skipping songs-don't mind not having a displayThe iPod shuffle is NOT for you if you-want to always have total control of what song is played yet-will put more than 50 songs on your iPod shuffle-want to put audio books on the iPod shuffle-mind not having a displayOne way to see if you will like the iPod shuffle is play a CD on shuffle mode.I hope this review was helpfull for you!"
1,annoying,"I bought this thing like everyone else-for simplicity and it's size. I have had acomputer since around 1989 and this product tops anything that I have tried to far with computing- totally annoying. what kind of engineer would think that this set up would enthuse someone about a product is beyond me. even the installation disk tried to automatically connect to the internet-uh I think not. apple I pod company now hear this-- I will connect to the internet when I feel like it, I will upgrade my media player when I feel like it, I will not change the way my computer functions(2003) to run your silly ANNOYING,sales pitch laden, borderline misleading, POOFY NEW AGE B.S. SET UP."
2,Better Option Available,"Aside from having the iPod name, this thing is nothing like it's parent-product. No screen, not as easily usable. If you're interested in finding a specific song on your iPod Shuffle, it'll be pretty difficult unless you know your list pretty well.I'd consider getting the SanDisk 512 Mb (or 1 Gb) Embedded MP3 player instead. It costs the same, has a screen, FM tuner, and voice recorder. A much added bonus is that it doesn't use proprietary software (ie iTunes). Just plug it in and drag and drop your mp3s."
3,IPOD Shuffle,While I like my shuffle it has problems. Particularly with the software. We have 3 in our family and they all have the same problem As Apple produces more up graded ipods they ensure that you have to purchase a newer one because eventually you can't change your play lists or anything.
4,Ipod Shuffle is da Bomb!,"I had been saving up for a while to get an Ipod mini, I was $50 short, but went to the apple store anyway. I saw the new Ipod shuffles for only $100, and I decided to buy one, it was probably the best purchase I ever made. Only 2 minor things that could have made this better. First of all, a small LCD screen, I like to know what is coming next, and second of all, I would have liked the USB 2.0 port a tad mor pronounced, I had a small amount of difficulty plugging it into my computer due to the size, I had to unplug the printer and the modem in order to charge it."
4,Brilliant design; limited usefulness,"This is the sleekest mp3 player on the market and worth the 99$. If you are happy listening to 100 or so songs in random order without being able to find a particular song, this will do. If you want to keep you 400$ Ipod with its fragile hard drive at home while you listen to some music during your workout, this will do, also. Having lost one ipod due to dropping it down a flight of stairs, I am not anxious to risk that again. The ipod shuffle was an investment I made in order to have a few hours of mp3 files with me at all times. I listen to talk and music files constantly (I have almost forgotten what radio is. Oh, yeah, that's that annoying thing with all the commercials and the small playlist of oldies). Think what you will be using this for before you buy it. If you have a big collection of music, save up for the full size ipod. If you do not, spring for this one. If you want something that is sturdy for everyday use, get this. Otherwise, forget it."
4,"cool gadget, ear pieces not reliable","Got an ipod a few weeks ago.Software worked fine with WXP (SP2)Device really easy to use.Took it on a trip to Argentina. Great on the airplanes.The right side of the earphones shipped with the unitdeveloped a buzzing sound after a week. Don't think itwas caused by misuse. I'll try returning it to Compusafor a new unit. Problem is the earpieces.The neckstrap and ear piece cords tend to tangle easily.The on switch picks up dirt. But these are minorconcerns. Recommend the device highly.My laptop is dual boot (WXP, Linux) Under linuxyou can mount the device and see all the files."
3,Better if it had a display..,"Dont get me wrong, this is a very nice mp3 player. But you can get a mp3 player that holds the same amount of songs for less that have a display. Also, i dont like the fact that you need iTunes to edit your playlist. To end on a positive note, this can double as a flash memory stick which comes in handy."
2,No SCREEN much bigger problem than I thought,"I understand Apple is trying to set a ""random"" list revolution with the Shuffle, and I've purchased one, but I realize there are many times I wish to be able to see how much further to go forward to play what I want. I can't memorize a 100 song playlist.I don't know where Apple is going with this, I'm going to return my Shuffle for a Sandisk 512, which is now lower in price and has a screen. I don't know where Apple is going with this...I wouldn't buy a car without essential gauges and I'm certain you will find it cumbersome at times with the Shuffle. I don't recommend this product. I'm sure it has great margins for Apple though. I need the screen, and you will find you will too."
1,Big waste of money and time,"I've tried 2 ipod shuffles now, thinking the first one must have a hardware issue (per an hour-long online chat with Apple support). But it's the same old story: it is not compatable with Windows. If you are not a Mac user, please save yourself the money and frustration of owning this product. I've spent gobs of money on peripherals, trying to fix the problem, to no avail. I should have bought a pair of Oakley Thumps like I wanted to, but thought I'd ""save money"" on a shuffle instead. What a waste!"
1,LIttered with inaccuracies!,"This book has some nice pictures, some interesting interviews, but all in all, it is littered with inaccurate information and lies!Regardless of what Kettlewell says: Karl Stockhausen is NOT considered the father of Dobly surround! Darius Milhaud is NOT considered the father of rap music!! Morton Subotnick NEVER wrote music on a Serge Synthesizer!!!All of these are in here, plus many other obsurd conclusions and comments! If you are after accurate information about electronic music, I would highly recommend that you pass over this one."
5,The Androids appear and Vegeta upgrades!,Invasion. THe Androids are here. Now Goku and the Z warriors must stop them... Only one word describes this video. Great! This is a great video. The Androids appear and Vegeta upgrades. This is one that cannot be missed!!!
2,FUNimation tapes worth their money?,"If you don't know anything about the Dragonball triology (DB, DBZ, DBGT,) and are a kid under 13, and you watch DBZ on Cartoon Network, I recommend this tape to you. Otherwise, the tape just plain sucks! Bad dubs, lame action sequences, and ""uncut"" my... Uncut to FUNimation means censoring everything, then add three drops of blood! I could understand the nudity and some hardcore violence, but censoring the names of the characters and the main points of the violence totally ruins the story plot. This tape shows a little bit of SSJ1, nothing beyond the first super sai-jin form. I recommend you not buy the tape for all the reasons above and about 5000 more and save your money, and not to watch it on Cartoon Network to save time, and to spend the money on the original Dragonball instead of this Funimation DBZ garbage."
2,NOT A GENERATOR - it's a BATTERY,"This unit is NOT A GENERATOR - it's a BATTERY. You can charge it up, and use the power later. Don't be confused at the name."
2,Over rated!,"This CD is over rated, the mix set is too repetitive and it sounds like the same thing over and over again on each track. The Lights ""Expand the room and Taylors ""Slide"" are amazing tracks! thats what the two stars are for. If you want to lissen to good progressive trance, lissen to Sasha's global underground 3 and 6. Also, Sahsa and John Digweed's Northern Exposer cd's (all of them) are a good buy, along with Paul Okenfold's Tranceport and Arcade America's Trance Global Nation 2. There are so manny great trance cd's out there that I could go on forever, this cd is not one of them."
1,WEAK!,"All of these guys are saying that ""This is the best trance cd ever,"" it really is not. If you want good proggresive trance, lissen to Sasha, John Digweed, Paul Okenfold, Christopher Lawerence or Paul Van Dyke, The list goes on and on. This cd is not mixed well and only has two good tracks, Taylor's ""Slide"" and The Light's ""Expand the Room."" Trust me, if you REALLY like trance, don't buy this c.d."
5,medievil freak,"I have always loved this album, and glad I could finally find a CD of it. I'm a big bass person, so love all the percussion and also the lighter jigs. So glad I could get hold of this again."
4,"okay, let me do the math&#65533;","well, really good songs. a strong album if you are simply into soundtracks like me, but::: hold on there, this is their tenth year reunion and the the movie was set in the late '90's and the music was all from the early to mid '80's?????? maybe they were just slow learners?"
4,Psychological Drama,"Although I felt this story was slow-moving, it was enthralling. The obsessive drive of a young man in the face of his beloved grandfather's death reveals his deep-seated sense of loss of everything that he held to be true in his life.I also appreciated the way life and death, even in hunting, was handled--with reverence and beauty. I like the ending--it leaves room for personal reflection, and the author's comments at the end of the recording provided even greater insight."
1,good beginning..,John lives with his grandparents and he goes hunting with his grandpa in deer season. He lives on a farm. One deer season John has to go by himself because his grandpa has cancer. I enjoyed the beginning. It has some action and good character development. I didn't like the ending because it had little action in it.
4,As good as you can get for under $100,"Overall a great buy and good value. The snare mic has the IDENTICAL frequency response to a SM57. (no joke... it's EXACTLY the same) so that's a plus. The toms mics are good for the upper toms, but sounds like poop on the floor tom. I took the 2nd tom mic and mic'd our sax player and it sounds great. We are using the kick mic on the floor tom and sounds incredible. We already had a AKG D112 on our kick so we really didn't need to use the CAD on the kick.The clips are cheaply made, but the concept design works very well. We are using these on our Gretch kit for our church services. All in all, If I had to do it over again, I'd buy another set for live app. For recording, you might want to spend a little more.I've been a (paid)sound engineer for 15 years."
5,very good product but...,"The material is just wonderful, very resistant to the pool water. Swimming is very comfortable in it. The only thing is it size...If normally you wear 4, order 6- then it will fit perfectly :)"
4,Softer than his other CD's.,"The first track (remixed?), ""Sea of Gems"" gave me the chills. Very powerful. Davy just has this magical way of playing music. A true master with the pipes and whistle. A soothing musical compilation."
4,Very Good,"Very good ""starter book! Basically, it contains the general information a ""newbie"" would need. I would suggest it for anyone new or exploring this subject."
1,skip it,"If you are on an island with only idiot's guides, then buy this book.If you collect idiot's guides, then buy this book.If you must own every book with the word Wicca in the title, then buy this book.HOWEVER, this book is NOT a good explanations of Wicca or Traditional Witchcraft. Instead, it's a whole bunch of new age stuff tossed around in a salad bowl, then smothered in a dressing we are all familiar with (the idiot's guide format) until it is recognisable, not as a salad, but as an idiot's guide.This book is NOT a good book of Shadows, oversimplfies WAY too much to be of use to a beginner, and, unlike the other complete idiot's guides, actually DOES seem to be named for the target audience.In a 1000 word format, no one could detail all its faults."
1,The name says it all,"I picked the book up and leafed through it. Considering that they had the elemental aspects written incorrectly on the Pentagram on the SECOND page, I decided that this must be a book for me ;) There are numerous other faults within the book, which in my mind make it a ridiculous book to give to someone who is just starting out in the Craft. I give it one star, I would give it less if I could."
3,A decent basic introduction,"On the whole this is a good introductory text--it's very accessible, explains important concepts well without going into an overwhelming amount of detail, and is a quick, easy read. Parts of it would be excellent for the younger reader for this reason.The tone is enthusiastic and personal, sometimes conversational, which can be a bit distracting from what I'd have assumed to be more of an overview. There are a few things that are IMO incorrect, but as far as I can tell not within the main body of the work, and I don't want to nitpick. The main issue I have with the book is the prescriptive tone it sometimes takes on--there are more ""shoulds"" and ""always"" and ""nevers"" than I'd expect in a general-information book about a subject that is very, very broad. However, as a basic book about mainstream eclectic Wiccan practice, it's not a bad choice."
3,Really Nice!!!,The Scenery in this DVD is Really Fantastic! The music is modern instumental with sound effects - you will either like it or not - but you have the options of playing just the Visual without sound...OR...play with some nice Instrumental of your Choice.....I've tried both and like either experience very much!The HD is perfect with this DVD.....and some of the Scenery had me enthralled....I really enjoy the experience.....sure to buy more of their Videography_ as I like to buy a Nb of quality content DVDs with Nature and Scenery.
4,Very inspiring,"I have enjoyed many of Dr. Hahn's book and feel confident in his theological interpretations. He has really helped me personally grow in my faith. I was excited to see this book because 1) I didn't realize Dr. Hahn was Opus Dei and 2) I thought if anyone could address some of the controversial aspects of the group, he would do an excellent job.On the upside, his book is so inspiring, written with passion and love. In fact, his presentation of the group's beliefs are more inspiring than the founder's own words in my opinion! It made me more curious about Opus Dei,and more accepting of the group. However, I was disappointed that Dr. Hahn never addresses the really controversial aspects of the movement, particularly it's treatment of women and self-flagellation. In addition, he doesn't give as personal an account as one might expect given the title. It is more a descriptive book than an auto-biography."
2,Classically broken,"Can't anyone make a blender that can hold up to normal use? I do have to say that the blender lasted for a while. The blades have now broken free of the gear assembly so it spins freely from the motor :(. It probably was during ice crushing and frozen fruit blending, but I would expect any blender to handle that load. Either chop it or don't but either way breaking is not an option, maybe they should have clutches to handle overload.I called for a replacement blade set and the kitcheaid parts department wants $39.95 to replace the blades not including shipping. I am not happy with a product where the replacement parts are more than half the price of a brand new blender. I will be shopping for a new blender and preferably not kitchenaid."
2,Not Pleased,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this particular popper. I thought this was the answer to popping corn in a brown paper sandwich bag in the microwave. I'm sad to say we were very disappointed.The first batch we popped about a quarter cup, no oil, no butter. It popped about a half of the popcorn leaving the rest unpopped. So we got about 2 cups of popcorn for 2 of us. The second time we decided to melt butter on top. Again we put in a quarter cup. This time it popped about 3 cups. So we popped a second batch with 1/2 cup (the limit)of what we thought was high quality popcorn. Hardly any of the corn popped. Does not work for a second batch. Very disappointing. It sounds like everyone else who wrote a review was pleased so maybe something is wrong with our popper. Needless to say we are sending it back."
1,Curse of the Black Widow on the Author,"If you're hoping for that ""dishy,"" tell-all, spicy account of Tallulah's life, this ISN'T it! That bio is still to be written. This attempt at capturing the essence of the grande dame suffers from two fatal diseases: tedium and barely tolerable--lethal combinations in any dose. And, there are glaring errors of fact. Someone fell asleep at the research table! Better to view some of la Bankhead's films than try to wade through these waters. Anyone got a Lifeboat?!!!"
1,Wrong Sensor,"Bad purchase, Place my order for Denso 234 4000 and was sent a Denso 12609159, lost my money and time."
2,ERRANOUS!,"If you take this book, and compare it to the works of Regardie, Crowley, or D.M. Kraig, you will see that it is riddled with errors. The information begoten by, and then expounded by, Waite in this book is what was fed to him in order to deter is efforts. Had he been given the real rituals, he wouldn't have slammed them so hard. Kinda' like his tarot deck, the symbolism is way off, why? He didn't know any better. 2 stars because it's a godd example of what NOT to do."
1,Horrible,I ordered the Abby Cadabby doll as a gift for my niece for Christmas and thankfully I ordered it early. It came in a Fiber One Brownie box for starters and the box was damaged. I opened the box to find a used doll that has numerous rips and tears in it and there was no DVD with it. The images on the site of a doll in a box is not what you will receive. I have ordered various items from Amazon over the years and have never had a poor experience until now. I contacted Amazon and the seller and am waiting to hear back from them as to how they will handle the situation. This was a very disappointing experience and I do not recommend this seller to anyone.
5,Love this saucepan,I really love this saucepan. I use this size a lot because I am usually cooking for only 2. It does well sauteing vegetables before I add other things to make a soup or a rice pilaf.
4,Watch It,This film is very nice to watch. The characters and story are interesting. They do a good job a building up tension between the two main characters which is lacking in most films today. The movie has a good sense of humor. It's French so it can be a little long for some and every once in a while this bad porn music is used which is actually pretty funny. This is a likable movie with cute women.
1,Glass Toothpick Holders Second Edition by Neila & Tom Bredehoft,This book has all the great toothpicks and pictures of the firstbook. The pictures have been redone and are brighter and clearer.Plus there are many new toothpicks and pictures for some that were just drawings in the first book. There is also a new contempory toothpick section and a section on foreign toothpicks.I think the authors would have a grandslam if they would of expanded the section on newer reprodutions by the newer companiesand included information on how to rate the condition and how the condition affects value. Great must own for toothpick collectors.
3,Bought it when it first came out.....,"I bought this the minute it came out because none of the existing iPod products at the time utilized flash memory--therefore they ""skipped"" during aerobic workouts. I use it a couple times a week and have loved it--but the slide on the back recently broke off. Even though I have the Nano, I'm gonna buy the new shuffle--I really enjoy the tiny size, and especially like the built in clip. I also suspect the new version will last longer, because it has fewer parts to break. I would have rated it a ""5"" if it had not broken."
1,IPod shuffle over hyped product,"iPod shuffle has a major flaws. If you are updating your music and you accidentally remove your ipod out of the USB, iPod will be damage.In short you cannot anymore use your iPod. Secondly, if you have multiple computer at home, say desktop and laptop, you can not use your iPod to both computer. It is only dedicated to one computer only. If ever you choose to go ahead and try to use the other computer, which was not the initial computer you use your iPod, you end up over writing your current iPod music. This royally suck. My advise not to buy any product from iPod. Best choice is SANDISK product."
3,Beware if using iPod Shuffle as a USB jump drive,"Just wanted to add what I have not noticed in other reviews: if you intend to also use the iPod Shuffle as a jump drive, it's NOT compatible with multiple operating systems (or even multiple versions of an OS)!Apple tech support confirms the Shuffle formats itself based on the first computer you dock with, and must be reformatted on another computer to use the data storage feature (assuming that other computer has iTunes installed).Leave it to Apple to take the 'Universal' out of 'Universal Serial Bus'."
2,You can't use it on multiple computers.,"The title says it all. This *feature* was not advertised and I don't want to buy some add-on software like ipodrip just to use the product that I bought. The only way to use it on multiple computers is to erase it completely each time, which stinks."
1,don't work,I have tried serveral times to load my shuffle with music with no results. My computer keeps saying that no iPod is recognized.Whats with this. With all the money I spent on this thing it should work. I am very disappointed with this product.Linda Larca
3,ok...not worth it,"I bought an iPod shuffle a summer ago, and loved it at first until all my friends laughed at me for buying an iPod without a screen. All of them had nanos. I felt left out. I am now going to buy another mp3 player. I have to admit I will still use it for exercising it is a great work out tool. Over all I don't think it's woth it buy a nano. A nano is just a little more money."
3,"Defective item, but Apple promptly substituted replacement!","I received this item and could not get it to work. I contacted Apple and they assisted me in trying to get the I-pod to download songs from my computer. When it would not download, they made arrangements for a replacement and were very polite!"
1,Nothing But Problems with My PC,I'm really unhappy with my shuffle. I bought it for my wife because it seemed like a simple mp3 player but in reality its been a huge pain. I often get errors that the drive can't be read from or written to. The only solution is to reformat the drive. If anyone is looking for a basic mp3 player for a pc - look elsewhere.
1,Unreliable. Cute Design. Bad Engineering. Poor Quality Control,"My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the ""Genius"" bar. At that appointment, the ""genius"" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple ""genius"" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius"" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.Perhaps it should be retitled the ""idiot bar."""
2,Not same as picture,"OK, this is not a review of the product itself. I like the brand Decleor and can vouch for it being great. BUT I was hunting for an older product they used to make in the whitening line and because its discontinued, I could not find it anywhere. I found this one by going by the name of the old product and looking at the picture that was associated with the ad. It was the old product which uses different ingredients than this new one for the same thing.Anyway, I got the newer version of the product, which I did not care for. Yes, it's the same line and very similar name, but it's NOT the same ingredients - entirely different product. Oh well."
1,A litany of facts does not a book make...,"1. First of all, I 100% agree with one of the reviewers that this is not for the ""lay"" reader... and I'm certainly a novice when it comes to this topic. Nonetheless, I can read and the overt problem with this book is that it's just a mishmash of factoids here / there, which is not the basic ingredients for a lucid / coherent book. Thus although many may be impressed with all of the minutia of detail, it rather has the opposite effect on me; If I'm going to put in the time to read/ learn about a certain topic, I think it's reasonable to expect that the author the present a coherent / logical narrative rather than million bits of information.2. For the novice, we might be better off looking to more standard fare when trying to tackle this subject."
3,Pretty Pictures,"This is a better-than-average coffee table book that gives a very personal account of the author's introduction to the history of the art of perfumery. Good inside information on advertising and perfume promotion. Who knew that CoCo Chanel was such a...freak? If you're looking for specific information about how perfumes are made, as I was, look elsewhere. You can zip through this book in about an hour."
5,HOLY BAT HISTORY !,"YOU BATMANIACS WILL CERTAINLY BE DELIGHTED AFTER WATCHING THIS VIDEO.IT'S GREAT FUN AND A MEMORABLE TRIP TO BATMAN'S PAST AND RECENT PRESENT.IT'S THE BEST DOCUMENTARY ON BATMAN I'VE EVER SEEN.ADAM WEST GIVES A NICE BRIEF BAT SPEECH,AND WE CAN REALLY GET TO KNOW WHY BATMAN OF THE PAST WAS DIFFERENT FROM BATMAN OF THE PRESENT.I WISH IT WERE AVAILABLE ON DVD AND IT CAME WITH ALL THOSE BAT FEATURES RANGING FROM BAT SNAPSHOTS,BAT SKETCHES AND BAT POSTERS TO MORE RECENT BAT INTERVIEWS.ANYWAY I LOVED IT. IT'S SWELL!"
1,"Ugly, tacky, pitiful","These are quite possibly the ugliest pearls I have ever seen. There was a deal and I thought, ""Eh. At that price ($4.50!! I should have KNOWN!) they'll be good for a little gift for someone - heck, I'll get two."" Boy, was I wrong. I would NEVER give these as a gift to ANYONE. Previous reviewer described them perfectly: orange, blemished, no clasp (though I couldn't manage that second star for them). Both sets are headed to my daughter's dress up box. I'm not sure even SHE will like them."
4,Pretty darn cool,"Yup, that's it. They're pretty darn cool. And great to dance to, I might add...Very unique, yet rockin'."
2,Large Quantities Only,"The cooker works well for me, even with Basmati rice, but the smallest unit it is set up for is four cups... which is a lot of rice for one person. Since they use a proprietary ""cup"" to measure things with (you put in 4 of their unit cups and then fill it the rest of the way up with water to the 4-cup line) it ends up making me a lot more rice than I need. It would've been nice if they'd provided some standard equivalency charts so we'd know what the ratio is. So I'm going to have to go through the hassle of measuring the water by straining it back out, then figuring out what ratio they're employing. Wouldn't it have been easier to just SAY the ratio? Maybe it won't work right with 2 cups? I dunno, I just know that I bought it because I tend to forget and leave it on too long. This was supposed to make things easier. If I was cooking for a family, maybe... If it's just 1 or 2 people, get a smaller one."
2,Not up to the Farberware reputation!,I have owned this product for just over a year now. I bought it to simplify cooking rice. This product did not help. The rice always seems to burn. Today I used shortening on the bottom of the pan before adding the rice and water. It worked. The rice did not stick to the bottom... first time for this. It still started to burn. I caught it at just the right time to save it. Also as others have noted the cover is not heavy enough to prevent starchy water from spewing all over. I've conquered this by placing an upside down coffee mug over the handle. It adds enough weight to keep it from splashing everywhere. All in all I would suggest you look for a better made product.
3,Fine book but can be better.,"I had high expectation for this book after reading many favorable reviews. This book is fine but somewhat less than expected. I was unable to find answers to many specific questions such as a general guide line on CO2 dosages, how to control snail, how to deal with tannic acid leached from drift woods, fertilization techniques. There is a helpful chart of all types of plants and it's care requirement. Unfortunately, many of the plants in the list does not have a picture in the book."
3,What the duece.,"It took a while to receive these, but that was from anyone. My problem was when I went to install they were too thick. I had to remove the break in coating and also remove the shims, even then It was a fight to install these. I will most likely stick with hawk pads on my next purchase. Other than that, they do seem to perform well."
3,An oddity,"I am not a Billy Joel fan - I do not like his music so much I change the station when one of his irritating songs come on the radio.That being said, this is pre-pop BJ, and is so bad it is almost good - its a lot of fun to listen to. I do not have this cd, only the original Attila on lp - yep, 99 cent cut-out bin special back in the day. At the time I got it I wondered, could this William Joel and Billy Joel be one and the same? The album is either godawful or brilliant, or both, but definitely interesting. Personally I wish BJ had kept going in this direction instead of inflicting 'Piano Man' and the rest of his crappy music on us."
3,My first sonic clock. Yay,"I definitely like the idea behind this clock. I don't think anything can shake me out of bed, however, short of a true earthquake. For whatever reason, I am about as hard and lazy a sleeper as they come. I am trying to find the miracle cure to make me just wake up as if by magic."
3,Good Product that will help,"The CLEP Western Civilization II book is a significantly summarized version of events from 1648 to present. Containing just 136 pages of reading material, it does offer two practice exams at the end containing 240 questions. I've always had an interest in history and possess a fair knowledge of events and time-lines. The CLEP test was very difficult; I received a barely passing grade of 54. I actually thought for sure I failed, due to frequent guessing! I Recommend this summary be read first, then go on to another textbook for supplemental information."
1,VERY POOR Customer Service,"The Tv was spectacular for 28 days! Only 28 days. Then on Dec.29 the TV went balnk... no picture, no sound. My gosh, the football bowl games were going on!!! I contacted Sony customer (mal)support and their recommended technician. On Jan. 10 he finally shows up (yes, I missed all the bowl games). He has NO CLUE what is wrong with the TV. The technician comes back on Jan. 25 and exchanges nearly every internal part of the TV!!! Still, no picture, no sound. I asked them for a new TV under warranty. HELL NO!!! Sony is NOT reasonable.... warranty is NOT worth the paper it is written on. I will not have a TV for the Super Bowl. I will NEVER buy another Sony product for as long as I live."
2,"Gack, They Have Done It to Us Again!!","They moved the mounting holes so you have to drill new ones because it won't fit your old mount.Aaargh! Not again! -My undercabinet is starting to resemble swiss cheese, since this is the third generation of new mounting holes they have forced upon me. -And the LED-s are dim and only better than the cruddy LCD display they installed on the next generation (-that had new mounting holes.)And it lasted a little over one year.If they weren't the only undercabinet, I would never buy another. And don't even try the stainless carafe model. It is pure crud.If you don't need an undercabinet, don't buy one of these. -Get something that works and lasts longer."
5,RATED 5 STARS BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T 6!!!,"This was ABSOLUTELY the best book I've read all year (2003)! Not only did I laugh, cry, and read it with barely putting it down, I bought 7 copies and gave them away with tissues!This book really reminded me of who I was meant to be... not in an arrogant and puffed up way, but that I am precious and that my Prince is coming after me, one day!! In the meantime, I am preparing to meet Him and making myself ready!Loved it! Loved it!! Loved it!!THIS is the ""Wild at Heart"" for women!! If you don't get this, you have your heart locked in a closet!!"
3,It was ok,"Not that it was a bad book but I think it's geared toward those who are more jaded with life. I did like how the author reminded us that we are daughters of the King and the last chapter for me, made the whole book."
3,Disappointing,"This book was not at all what I expected. I agree with the reviewer who said that the author uses a lofty tone just for the sake of being lofty. This is the first book of Nicole Johnson's I've read, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I thought the idea of a princess heart had a lot of potential, but I got tired of the whole princess thing very quickly. I had a hard time finishing this book and found myself thinking ""Come on, get to the point already."""
1,Don't judge a book by the cover.,"I was so disappointed with this book. I bought it for a book discussion group some ladies in my church were doing. I found this to be very light-weight reading, and it didn't do much in the way of edifying me in my Christian walk. If you want to read about how much God loves you, there are many, many other much better books out there - try the Bible. I'm sorry I wasted the money on this book."
3,incomplete rim joist insulation information,"I am a novice do it yourselfer renovating a house, starting with the basement, starting with insulation.Page 53 of this book describes an incomplete process for insulating rim joists.Insulating rim joists requires an air barrier. Paper faced fiberglass is not an air barrier. Paper faced insulation is an easy solution but it is a wrong solution.Perhaps the book intends that there will be more work done by applying rigid foam to the entire wall, including the rim joist. That sounds reasonable, though I am not an expert. I do think it should be made more clear for novices who may not finish the entire basement.I am using Green Building Advisor website as a final check before I put in any insulation. It has an active community. Wasting time and money by having to redo a project would be the worst possible outcome. This book is by Creative Publishing and normally their books have clear instructions. I have bought 100+ used books and am trying to avoid mistakes."
2,Disappointing,"By looking at the product, you would think this would be a great rattle. The colors are vivid and the design is perfect for a child's hand. The problem with the toy is it only has one or two small balls in the rattle part. As a result, when it's shaken, it hardly produces any sound. There are better rattles out there to help stimulate your child."
5,LIMBSAVER PADS ARE GREAT,"This slip on pad will fit snugly if you buy the right size, not wobbly like the old orange rubber slip on pads. For most rifle and shotgun stocks, such as Remingtons and Winchesters, the medium is the correct size. The medium size also fits the AR15/AR10 rifles using the standard A4-type plastic fixed stock. The felt recoil reduction is excellent."
3,too slick for its own good,"When I sampled a few cuts on Amazon.com I was impressed by the musicanship. But having purchased the CD I'm a bit disappointed. As one reviewer here wrote, it is a good CD to have on while going about one's business. I agree. But for a Car CD or to listen to closely, I feel, while it has a high degreee of musical accoomplishment, there is a generic, studio-session-man slickness that keeps one distanced from the real essence of the music.Furthermore, for me there are too many Georgie Fame bland vocals and too few Gary Brooker, Procol Harum vocals. I do like the female voices. I also confess a prejudice against what I would call 1940's jive music, the kind Brian Setzer plays. Therefore these selections are not as pleasing to me as the R and B and blues, and there are several of them.So, good for a party or while otherwise engaged, but too seemless to be deeply engaging."
1,"Warmed over reifications of ""science"" & ""philosophy""","These guys should get a little help from an expert like Noam Chomsky who could set them straight. What a boring, uniformed attempt to ""appear""scholarly. Thankfully, I got my money back for the book."
2,"Inconsistent performance, ripped off on shipping","After waiting 10 days to get it. Paid for priority ($4.99) but mailed out 1st class ($1.43), teh products performs inconsistentely. Finally I have to go out and spend $20 or so for a newer version or my son will keep complaining that his itouch isn't charged up."
1,Erased my iPod mini tunes!,"We travel alot, so this seemed like a good purchase idea. We charged our iPod mini's and that was easy enough, but then we realized it erased our music and audiobooks. We tried to reconnect at home on our computers, and the library would no longer export to the minis! It's bad enough the music and all was erased while we were on the road, but then not to be able to put it back on is adding insult to injury. We use Windows Home XP, maybe there's an issue there, but in any case, it's a major hassle and not worth the purchase price. We're sending it back."
5,Seahawks Fan,"Bought this as a gift for my brother, he loves it even though it is not wireless, he is a major Seahawks fan."
4,Good & Well-preserved,"Other than some pencil scribbles and marks in the book, it's almost brand new. Unfortunately, the seller doesn't deliver to Malaysia and therefore I've had to get it mailed to a friend in the US and then mailed it back to me in Malaysia (with normal registered mail). I wish the seller could deliver to Malaysia to lessen the hassle. We are in serious lack of quality books like this and need as much affordable resources as we can. Thank you for the quality second-hand books. It means a lot to the improvement of our knowledge and education."
5,Give an opportunity to this......,"There are CD's that are like love at first sight, or in this case, listening.If you are in the mood for easy listening, romantic banda music, this is your CD.Juan Carlos González is a newcomer singer/songwriter who is a banda version of Ricardo Arjona. More than a typical songwriter, Juan Carlos is a poet.The song ""Quien Fuera"" in particular stands out for its poetry. Lines like ""I wish I were your hair so I could feel your hand when you touch it, too bad I'm nothing, just a guy who dreams too much"" is just a sample of saying ""I love you, but I can't be with you"" in a much more poetic way.I cannot describe the admiration I have for Juan Carlos.I strongly recommend it. Especially if you need a break from today's sadly popular songs that only talk about sex and drugs. This is throwback to good ol' romantic music."
2,A Out Dated Book By Today's Standards,"The book is a little strange and the language is dated (cira 1960's - 1970's).The story is about takes place sometime in the future, but never fully explains when in the future it takes place in. The story could take place in the 1980's or 2000's, the author never makes it clear to the reader. The sex is extremely softcore and with some references to homosexual acts, the story moves along at a semi-fast clip.The charaters in the story are a strange assortment of good, bad and fence sittersIF you can ignore the outdated langage and descriptions and don't mind some extremely (by today's standards) PG rated sex acts, then this book is for you."
2,Tally Ho,"An o.k. story if you can get past the talking birds and animals. Tough to be outfoxed by a fox! I thought this was the first book by Ms Brown I had read, but on checking my list of books read, I find ""Riding Shotgun"" which I don't recall one bit. I guess there were no talking animals in it. Guess not too much effort was put into solving the mystery at the time of Nola's disappearance cause everyone thought the 2 eloped. But had there been, it wouldn't have been difficult to uncover the culprit at that time and might have spared another person's life.Long live the clever fox."
3,Hotspur Review,"I find myself disappointed with this book. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Sneaky Pie Brown books. But this, is it a story or a guide to foxhunting? I kept waiting for the story to get going and all I got was more explanations on fox hunting. This story for me fell flat"
2,Tedious,"I have been a fan of Rita Mae Brown's for about 20 years and have read most of her books, and this was by far the most tedious. I like horses/horse people, have ridden in many disciplines and know the culture. That aspect may be interesting to people who know nothing about foxhunting, horses, etc., but I don't know that it adds much to the story, and if you don't care about such things, try another book. I think Ms. Brown should just write a book on foxhunting, as such, and get it out of her system.The story, presumably being the murder mystery, is ho-hum. I didn't care about the deceased - they were far less vivid than even the peripheral animal characters - and since there was no real investigation to follow, I found myself wondering why I kept reading.Oh yeah, builds character."
5,A LOOK INTO FENCING'S PAST,"The Baron de Bazancount wrote an interesting little volume on fencing (nicely illustrated) at the turn of the century, which has now been faithfully reprinted by Laureate Press. I'm not exactly sure I agree with his fencing philosophy in total. Some of his views on training are debateable. He was a bit too much of a generalist in his attempt to ""demystify"" and ""simplify"" fencing. He might even have been a bit of a fencing ""socialist."" Maybe not an anarchist, but he was definitely pushing fencing's classical foundations. So, if you don't take ""Secrets of the Sword"" as a teaching manual, you'll be fine. Read it as a look into fencing's fascinating past, and you'll be fine. As the author of ""The Encyclopedia of the Sword,"" ""The Art and Science of Fencing,"" and ""The Inner Game of Fencing;"" and the Editor-in-Chief of FENCERS QUARTERLY MAGAINE, I recommend this book."
2,Not Too Informative...,"I feel as though this book could have given more information about JK Rowling. Only about two of the chapters were about her life in general, the rest of the book was basically about the Harry Potter series and the fame the books are reciving. These other chapters really are of no use to people who want to learn about Rowling's life, it's basically about her writing. Maybe someone who hasn't read the Harry Potter books would find the entire book interesting. If you're a devoted fan, just skip it."
5,Great Product,I found this product great and provider too :) We feel better using this product. I would like to recommend this product.
5,I can tell.,"I've been using this supplement for a while and at first I really couldn't tell that much of a difference....until I stopped using it.The gas, the bloating, the.....UUGH.All of these symptoms came roaring back to life when I stopped using Kyo Green.As soon as I started using it again, all my symptoms were gone the same day.The pros?It makes my tummy feel normal.It mixes without clumps.The cons?It tastes pretty bad but who cares.I cannot live without this product.Highly recommended!!!"
3,Obviously not modern...,"I purchased these in order to simplify the teaching of mathematics to my children. They will work well for that, however, I will have to re-write portions of the book or more likely instruct them orally in order to make these work. My biggest complaint was that two of the books were NOT hardcover. So anyone that cares, beware..."
2,Not for everyday use,"I've bought this combo about a year ago at Best Buy. The picture quality is great, but DVD player stoped reading any DVD disks (must admit that DVD player was in use almost every day for at least 1 hour) while being able to recognize any audio CD. I've checked with a local repair shop, so it would cost $70.00 (parts) + $90.00 (labor) = $160.00 at least (add tax and possible increase in repair cost if some other parts need to be changed). Today the same combo can be bought at the same Best Buy for $180.00. Buy one if you don't plan to use it for a long time."
3,training,"If you still know Shaolin Gong Fu and you want to learn a new form, this small book is a good choice. If you are a beginner, take the money for the first lesson in a good martial arts school."
2,Invisible,This movie starts out with a story but then gets way off track somewhere and ends up making no sense.
2,"Maybe for Alpha Blondy fans, or international/French/African reggae fans","I am a huge Alpha Blondy fan, but unfortunately, if you want to get into Alpha Blondy, I think Best Of, Jerusalem, Cocody Rock, and Masada all have better songs. Maybe that's just my taste though. I guess from the album cover I was hoping for another Cocody Rock, so I'm a little disappointed after listening only once."
2,Sappy Stuff Poorly Written,"Although Carol Ortlip has a tender story to tell, it's written in the most hackneyed, superficial and self-centered way. There were no universal realizations here. Despite her experience, it's just not deep enough to be a satisfying read. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages."
1,"NOT A ""24 PACK""!!!! Description is a total lie","Item description is a complete lie as is the savings they claim. This item is not a "":24 pack"" I purchased this and received one single outlet box. Not to mention the price is double what I would have paid at my local Home Depot. I'm not only disappointed by pretty sure it is against the law to advertise 24 pack and then send one single box."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad Supplier","No Stars would be better. My husband bought me this unit for Christmas. This was his first online shopping experience and he nor I will ever shop from Office Depot, Tech Depot etc..ever again! You think you are buying from Office Depot when your item get shipped from Tech Depot who then denies that they are the same company when you call them. It is impossible to know ahead of time but, they will not return ANY Toshiba products even if they are defective. They did apoligize that Amazon has an incorrect return policy posted on their site.....go figure! Do not purchase from them unless you want absolutely NO support."
2,Overpriced - issues from the start,"We bought this player when it first came out and spent over $500.00 for it. It came w/ all the accesories and that's nice.The unit itself has been inconsistent. It Intermittently shuts off after a few hours using the lighter 12V plug-in option - in an A/C'ed vehicle...? It's very finicky about what DVD's it will play too. Some not at all. No scratch issues on the DVD, it plays fine in other devices - just not THIS one...?Now the 12V power adapter is fried (it's sealed - so no replacing the fuse!) and my bet is finding a new one will be impossible...which makes this unit a door stop. The battery will give you about 4 hrs. of play time on a charge...not long enough for the trips we take!"
4,Will be watched more than once,"All though this book did not follow the book exactly, it still was pretty good. I didn't really like the character they had for Hammond Maxwell but I saw Mandingo first and liked that actor better. Ken Norton played a tremedous role as Drum and as Mede in Mandingo---hats off to him. Anyone interested in the Falconhurst Series this is a must see movie!!!"
4,Great gift for my husband!,"He loves Futurama and loves having Bender on his desk at all times. But, if it falls on the floor, it does cone apart, but can easily be put back together. More of a hassle than anything."
3,Futurama Collector Bender,"Nice collector type item for a Bender Fan. Just a statue, not a action toy."
5,Amazing!,Thats all I can say about this CD! WOW!! Basil Poledouris has always been one of my favorite composers. And this is one of my favorites of his works. If you are into highly emotional (sad) classical music. Get this CD!! A+
2,"Pretty much useless, as are most aftermarket ""manuals.""","I should have known better than to expect this manual to be the exception. It's got tons of useless filler, the same generic boilerplate padding that they put in all of their manuals. I tried the book for three different common issues with the car and none was addressed well enough to help at all. The book contains a huge chapter on overhauling the automatic transmission, which is something that probably nobody would ever attempt, but then when you look up simple maintenance items it tells you that this is too technical and you should take it to the dealer. Way to go, Chilton."
3,Contains wheat and soy,I cannot say how this tastes but just want to let others with food allergies know that this contains wheat and soy. I could not find the ingredients anywhere online and it is not sold in the stores locally.
5,the best,Guimar Novaes is the one and only performer for the Chopin Nocturnes. I've just begun to listen to her playing the Etudes and others on the CD's. I can't listen to anyone else play the Nocturnes.
4,"The Queens in English, not bad at all","Fans of great South African music need no introduction to the Mahotella Queens. Simply put thier music is uplifting in any language. Here, instead of their usual Zulu tunes, they take a stab at the English language market. With their ever-present partner Malanthini the groaner (RIP), they do an English version of their hit ""Kazet"" entiled ""Won't You Sing Along."" The real masterpiece here are the final tunes ""Pray the Good Lord/God Is On Our Side"" (they kind of blend into each other for good effect). Very uplifting, no matter what you believe. Only minor drawback is that it is clear that they are not accustomed to singing in English and the lyrics come off as a trifle stilted in some places, but overall it's a good effort and a fine intro for novices of S/A music."
1,"""Horrible- Double the Horrible""","I love Dolly, but this CD containing 2 original albums sure isn't the Dolly I love. It's obvious now why she was a flop in the pop field if this is an example. This is ""NOT"" country, darn if I really know what to call it, but I can't stand it. Right now I'm going to put it in my collection that I call the Garbage Can. Oh well, maybe Ill keep the case, can always use it to replace a broken one. If you like Dolly the way she started and when she was with Porter then stay far far away from this awful mess."
5,I love this CD!!!,"Standing Hampton is such a great CD. The first half is the best, but its all good. It's amazing how much Sammy's music changed from his work in the 70's to this breakthrough. Standing Hampton started Sammy's reign in the 80's. His voice sounds great and the music is outstanding."
4,FINDING YOURSELF,"This book is very insightful about identifying your individual feeling of rejection, the contributing factors of rejection, how those feelings can be generational, our responses to rejection. This book directs you to biblical scriptures and offers case scenarios. In my opinion it is not a book that can be read hastily. However,personal reflections/case scenarios will spark your continued reading. Some words may seem misspelled to some readers the but are not. It is my belief that the authors are not American writers - do not let that discourage your reading of this bookExcuse Me... Your Rejection Is Showing. The concepts in the book are easily understood"
5,complex acoustic simplicity,"turnstyles and junkpiles, upon first listen, is one of the simplest albums i have ever purchased. however, with each successive listen, i hear more and more complexity. the folk-ness expressed in each song is completely genuine and rather groundbreaking, considering the complexities that most of these artists usually work with. it impresses to hear the range of influences that the performers invoke, from bluegrass to the hints of judaism on lyasna. it is one of the best albums i have purchased in quite sometime and as usual, bettina richards' taste in what she puts out on her thrill jockey label astounds me."
5,Real people,"What I love about McMaster Bujold's vorkosigan series is that it is science fiction, but the situations are so familiar and understandable that you're not constantly thinking about the science behind the scenes. The characters take it for granted, and so do we readers. That is a type of realism because if you really live in such a universe, you would take the technology for granted, much as we take mobile phones and tablets for granted."
4,A Great Read and A Great Beginning,"Lois McMaster Bujold sets us up with a kick ass heroine in Cordelia Naismith who is trying to survey what she thought was an uninhabited planet. Next thing we know, she is plunged into a battle with the forces of Barrayar and her life is completely changed. This is an excellent book that starts the reader down the path to the later Miles Vorkosigian novels. Bujold is a maaster of both love and war and this novel shows why science fiction when done right can rise to the level of the finest literature. Highly recommended. Read this book!"
3,"XTC.....some good songs, but Partridge gets on your nerves.","I have to take this album a few songs at a time, because who can really tolerate Andy Partridges singing style for more than 2 or 3 songs? That whiny English balderdash or whatever you want to call it. It's irritating. Too bad, because there are some very good songs on this album. Ball and Chain and Senses, he does the least whining, and guess what? Those are the best ones."
5,The one that started it for me,"My friend Gary owned the local record store, and he kept me updated on new music in the days when I still cared (about new music). One day in 1982 I walked in and this was playing. Actually, I still remember which song - Runaways - and it knocked me out. I asked him who it was, and he told me, ""ecstacy""...""ecstacy?"" I repeated. ""No"", he said, ""ecstacy; spelled XTC. OK, that was cool. It wasn't even released in the U.S. yet, so I had to buy the import (which was cool because it was a 2 record set). It didn't leave my turntable for a week. I loved the production and the ringing 12-strings. Furthermore, I got the lyrics, filled as they were with double entendre, cryptic cynicism, and intelligent social commentary. It turned me into a lifelong XTC fan. My XTC mania has abated somewhat all these years later, but younger people looking for intelligent music should not overlook this really fine album, and really fine banc."
2,Spotty reception,"This system didn't work well in our house. But, we don't get good reception with phones either. There were very few areas we could put the monitor and get good reception from the cameras. I would have rated it better had it not been such a pain to return. These additional cameras come from Canada and it is very incovenient to get it back to the company. Amazon is great to deal with; their partners (in this case) are not worth the trouble."
2,she did a good job trying at least,"This CD is ok. I gave it 2 stars: 1 for her singing (nice job) and 1 for trying. The only song I really liked was ""Boy You Knock Me Out"" and that was pretty much it. You will like this CD if you really love slow jams. There are only 2 up beat joints on here: Boy You Knock Me Out and Daydreamin'. I'll have to admit that I was pretty dissapointed when I first got this CD back in '99 (it was released in '98, but I got in '99), but I have to admit this also, Tatyana has a really good voice. Ususally people who come from acting to singing can't sing at all ( we all know Jennifer Lopez aka J.Lo's story). I recommend this CD to people who really like slow songs. If you are a person more into upbeat party music like me, I recommend that you don't get this album."
3,Could have been better...,"I thought this CD was OK. She could have done a lot better, though. The first half of the CD was good, but the second half was too slow and talked about love on every single song. I bought this only for Daydreamin, but that wasn't really worth it. Listen to some samples and see what you think of them."
3,cool,she was cool and showed off her vocal skills on the fresh prince of bel air series tatyana was tight produced by will smith and too bad she was a one hit wonder.
4,IF YOU LIKE BRANDY YOU'LL LIKE THIS ALBUM!,"Tatyana is very very talented! O.K.it's through that the cd ain't perfect, but give the girl a break. It's only her first album. There should be more songs like ""boy you knock me"" out on it, but all the songs are great. She's got a beautiful voice and she really feels the song. I love all the songs, but ""yesterday"" is my favorite. I know people compair her with Brandy and Monica, but so what? I'm a big Brandy fan and I don't mind that they look a like, because that's the music I like. But you have to admit that their voices are very different! If you love Brandy, buy this album!"
4,Fresh new sound that you're sure to love!!!,"Tatyana Ali's Kiss the Sky is a fresh new album with a number of great songs. My favorites are Everytime and Daydreamin'. Tatyana has blossomed into a hot new star and I can see more albums in her future. Be sure to check it out, you won't be dissappointed!"
2,okie dokie,"I heard Tatyana sing on one of the episodes of Fresh Prince of Bel Air and I thought she was going to be the next Mary J. Blige. But when I heard her on these childish tracks, her voice sounded totally different! I hope on her next album, she will get with some REAL producers like Jimmy Jam or Babyface ( leave Will Smith), Become an R&B artists instead of a Pop artist, get some deep, mature lyrics ( not saying she should be like Lil Kim), stay away from sampling other artists music and BRING BACK THAT VOICE I HEARD ON ""FRESH PRINCE!"""
3,More of a portrait of Bill Evans than anything else...,"This album is a good introduction to Bill Evans, and focuses a lot more on Bill Evans than his trio or his other work with other artists.However, I would not really recommend this CD. The selection of tracks seems loose-knit and somewhat unbalanced. The two tracks with vibraphonist Dave Pike could have been omitted, they really are the low point of this disc. This, plus the quantity of tracks featuring Bill Evans and Eddie Gomez makes me wonder what actually was the purpose of this CD? Is it an intro to Bill Evans work, or is it just a random collection of tracks, some previsouly unreleased, some not?"
3,Not breathtaking.,"I bought this cd, because I really liked the song ""And I am telling you I'm not going."" I had heard Jennifer Holliday sing it during the Tony's a few years ago, and was blown away by her performance. It's one of the few memorable songs on the cd, but still a good cd overall."
1,defective CD,I purchased Dreamgirls from Amazon.com twice. It is a Decca Broadway production. Both CDs have the same defect and needed to be returned. They are missing the first track and only play the remaining tracks on one CD player in my car.
4,"Enjoyable ""fluff"" escapism!","If you like Barbra's Broadway album, Dusty Springfield, mid-career Diana Ross, this is a well-done 80's album that is nicely produced and presents excellent sing-along music (do not get in Jennifer Holliday's way--wow!)."
3,A valuable Jeep Wrangler resource,"I have had Haynes manuals before, so I trusted that this one for our recently purchased 1999 Wrangler would be a good resource. And it is as expected, with 2 caveats: 1) that you don't mind wading through perhaps half of this repair manual that does not apply to your Wrangler(covering 15 model years is a bit much!); and 2) that you also buy a 19xx Owner's Manual specific to your year and model along with it."
2,Bah-Humbug,"I bought this album on the basis of a review in Sterophile Magazine. Big mistake! The acoustic guitar playing is very nice and he is obviousley a good technician with regard to his playing but unforunately, his playing is interrupted with his singing which is not in the least enjoyable. Good guitarist, poor vocals."
4,The singles-collection of the Beatles of New Wave,"XTC were (and still are, by the way) a great British band, combining great musical skills with a Pythonesque sense of humour. The non-workingmen Beatles of New Wave. This collection brings you some of their more non catchy tunes like 'Making Plans For Nigel'. Check it out!"
1,Computer would not POST with card in PCI slot,"So I bought this card despite reading all the negative comments on amazon and other retail websites, terrible idea. No matter which PCI slot the card was in the computer failed to POST. It would just hang before anything would show up on the screen. I took the card out and tinkered with BIOS settings and still nothing. I tried taking the jumper off the card (I read somewhere that this would prevent the mobo from trying to boot from the card) still nothing. I put the mini-disc that came with the product into my laptop to see what kind of documentation there was with it. The readme file was junk. It told me how to install it as if my mobo could see it so that didn't help at all. Anyhow it's not worth it."
3,Shallow But Worth the Effort,"This album did not age well, to say the least. While spawning some of the 80's most memorable tunes ""Heat of the Moment"", ""Only Time Will Tell"" and ""Sole Survivor"", the remaining songs never reach the same level and are hardly worth the effort. Give this one 2 stars for content and 1 star for getting these guys in the studio in the first place. Good idea, but less than perfect execution mars what could have and should have been so much more."
4,ASIA Hits the Mark with this Album,The quality of music compliments the cool-looking album cover. I tip my hat to the people that put the album together to produce classic rock that my JBL GS400 speakers were designed to reproduce.
5,Great common sense!,"Sometimes, it's hard to see the obvious, and even harder to see the not so obvious. John uses plain old common sense when he talks about - life. The yeah-I-knew-that obvious and the why-didn't-I think-of-that-before obvious. A great read. Lots of great quotes."
4,Raw and Tight!,"Elvis is alive and kicking in this original unplugged concert. If you enjoyed listening to ""Eric Clapton Unplugged"", then you will enjoy ""Tiger Man"". ""Tiger Man"" is high voltage from the start and ends with the beautiful and reflective ""Memories"". Elvis is screaming out lyrics with raw energy that had been building up since Elvis returned to the United States in the early 1960s.""Trying to Get to You"",""Tiger Man"", and ""Memories"" are the high points of the show. It is not ""The Way It Is"", but it is better than ""The Number Ones""."
4,The Royal Ballet's Romeo and Juliette,"The dvd is very nice. if you are a ballet lover, Fonteyn and Nureyev will impress you."
1,unacceptable,"the video quality of this dvd is bad, terriable and completelyunacceptable. i strongly against the purchase of this dvd because of it's video quality. if you do purchase it you will proably return it as i did."
2,beware of exaggerated reviews,"I am a fan of french movies and epic tales. This movie however, bored me to no end. Usual tale of love longing and lost when fulfilled. There is little romance, and the kind of passion it portrayed deserves its sad endings. If you enjoy it purely from the costume and location, you may find it worth while to see it once, but no more."
2,Old fashioned movie making,"I'm a sucker for historical dramas. I was expecting more when I came across this movie.I'm not sure where I saw this, but there was an interview with the director and he talked about how most period pieces tend to have a very traditional filmmaking approach, and he wanted something modern and vibrant for this story about young people in love. I thought that sounded like a great idea. Too bad he didn't do that.Sure, there are some hand-held shots every now and then, I suppose... but this movie looks and feels like it was made in the 80's...I've watched plenty of modern french films, and their innovation in movie making is unrivaled (past and present) but this is not one of them. The story is also noticeably rushed, expecting the audience to accept that relationships have formed with what we're told, rather than seeing those relationships grow on screen.Unless you are REALLY looking for a sad, french, historical romance, I'd look somewhere else."
4,Good alternative to the thinner mini crib mattresses,"I'm so glad I purchased this mattress instead of using the thin pad that came with my DaVinci mini crib. Highly recommended. I think the mattress could be a bit firmer, but it definitely beats using the 1-inch pad. Definitely worth paying a bit extra, especially if you use the mini crib as your everyday sleeping area for your baby as I do."
2,Great while it lasted,"We bought this mattress in 2008 for our DaVinci Anabelle minicrib. It was great while our daughter was small, but after about a year, the outer shell started to crack. At this point we also started to notice indentations where she slept, and it became rather lumpy. It's not that she was a heavy baby either - she was a preemie, and at the age of 18 months (when we stopped using it), she was 23lb.While it was a good investment at the time, in hindsight it would have been better to spend an extra $40 and get a higher quality mattress.Unless you're looking to save some $$, or you're using a minicrib as short term/not every night for 2 years sleeping arrangement, I wouldn't recommend this mattress."
2,Not Firm,"This mattress is not firm. I see no advantage to it over the 3"" version. Also, when I received my Alpha Mini Rocking Crib, the instructions said not to use a mattress over 5"" and this one is 6"" - great....We haven't used it yet, but it doesn't even compare to my first child's full size crib mattress - wish they had that quality for the mini crib."
1,Not firm or supportive,"This mini mattress arrived today and is already re-packaged to be returned. I'm surprised by the number of favorable ratings. It is way too soft for an infant mattress, in my opinion. It is not remotely firm and I think the quality is lacking, especially compared to the Serta mattress we have for our traditional crib. I really would not feel comfortable letting my infant sleep on it. She is 18 lbs. and sinks into it. I also agree with others that it's somewhat noisy, it makes a crinkly sound with any movement. I'm going to order theDream On Me 3"" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, Whiteand hope it is an improvement over this one."
3,Funnest band ever!,"I was, and probably still am, this bands biggest fan. I was there when it happened and will always have the best things to say about them. However, this cd in particular does not come close to giving the listener the full experience of how they sounded. When the band put this cd out, they did it garage style, sold them at shows, and never charged anyone more than $10, so I am amazed that these dealers could ever expect almost $40 for them. If you really want to check them out, and I think everyone should, look for them on youtube. Great live clips to be seen. At that point if you still want a cd, contact them and buy one from them. They deserve it more than these sellers."
5,Great guitar,"I did not buy this on amazon, however i do own it and received it as a Christmas present a few years back. Its a great guitar, plays nice and sounds clean. When I play this I feel as if I'm playing a more expensive Fender Strat. I really like to play Clapton songs with this guitar but other styles sound good too."
5,A beautiful collector's item for Lord of the Rings fans,"I recently purchased this figure of Gandalf for a gift. It is one of the nicest 12"" figures I've seen in a long time: the attention to the details of the face, the way the robe falls on the figure's body. This is definitely an item that will be worth much more than what it costs today in a few years time. Note: can't determine much about the item's durability. It's too soon to know, really."
4,A QUALITY PRODUCT AT A LOW PRICE,"I love using this pan for light sautees. It's sturdy & durable, yet light enough to feel like an extension of your hand. It seems to heat rather quickly & evenly & is a snap to clean. Highly recommended."
4,"Helpful, but annoying voices....","So, this video is very helpful. My 3 year old knows his planets in order from this song! My 6 year old understands all about planets, rocks, etc. Downside...one of the characters has a REALLY annoying voice. I am from NY, but goodness, this is ridiculous. She can actually confuse things because of pronounciation! If you can get past the voices, this video is great."
5,Brightens the room,"We replaced a 300W halogen touchiere with this light and this lamp on its hih setting brightens the room more than the halogen. It was easy to set up and so far, no problems."
3,terrible shade great light,"Classy Looking, the light output is great the shade is actually damaged from the heat of the bulbs. Looking for a replacement shade."
4,Last Trip to Vegas,"This is a veryfacinating story of the gambling world, of which Mr. Adams has done a lot of research.This shows how people intertwine in each others lives to attain what they think they want most in life with little regard to the outcome.I recommend this book to everyone who may be facinated by the world of ""Las Vegas"". I hope to see this book made into a movie someday. Mr Adams is an excellent story teller!"
3,Not my taste,"I readily accept all the other reviewers' assertions that this album represents outstanding Tejano music--it's just not my taste. I have no previous experience with this musical tradition, and I was hoping for something more along the lines of Eddie Palmieri or Arturo Sandoval. To me, this sounds like the kind of pleasant but bland music one would barely notice in the background at a Mexican restaurant. If you're hoping for something with drive or a bit of an edge, this isn't it."
4,"Buy Los Lobos - ""La Pistola y la Corazon"" First","I really love this CD, but I have to say that the Los Lobos album La Pistola...is the better of the two. My only beef with Los Super Seven is it seems a little over-produced, but I like the variety for the most part.So...Buy both, just buy La Pistola first!"
1,Please stop fawning over Lorraine Sinkler,"There is no justification for the turmoil this book caused. As Lorraine started her legal battle to publish this book (which the court stopped) friends of Lorraine should have helped her overcome her desire to promote and profit from her relationship with Joel. If it comes up for sale, it should be ignored. I hope readers will realize that the reason it was not published is because Sinkler left out large parts of Joel's letters to her, the parts that were often critical or unflattering so you will be getting a very distorted view of the correspondence. Lorraine manipulated her editing of Joel' correspondence as she had done for years and years. Finally, it caught up with her when the family stopped this book. Unfortunately, many students had to pay the price. Read Lorraine's quotes at [...]."
4,Review of the New Perfume Handbook,"This is a valuable tool in perfume research. Most men's and women's scents, as well as their fragrance houses, are listed here in a no nonsense format. I find 98% of what I need here-fragrance notes of individual perfumes, history of the perfume houses, years of introduction of scents,etc. However, the book is in Black & White, with few photographs. It addresses the making and composition of perfume; with no emphasis whatsoever on collecting. There is little science of perfume and no real chemistry. There is an interesting bonus chapter on recipes for ancient perfumes. The price is a bit high for a small reference book that is a few years old."
4,A superb Whitesnake album,Slide it in is one of the best albums from Whitesnake and was one of their best which featured some of their hits like Slide it in and others.This album is really good and is highly recommended.
4,ex PURPLE is back to the top,"The songs are powerful,.love aint no strangers is agood powerfull ballad song, Slow and easy is a tyüical slow blues tune. This album is much better than Saints and sinners or snake bite. The line up were Cozzy Powell (RIP) on Drums, Mel galley, Mickey Moody (guitar), Colin Hodkinson (bass), John Lord (keyboard), and DC (voice). Coverdale had grown up with DEEP PURPLE in the middle of 70's. He was the second voice of DP, replaced Ian Gillan in 1973. If you are an unfair music man, you would probably claim that Coverdale is a METAL ZEPPELIN HAIR singer, cause he has copied ZEPPELIN sound. It is not true my friend! He has also a powerfull voice too,...he did not copy ZEP sound, only tried to combinate PURPLE and ZEP sound trick together. because we all know that Zeppelin and PURPLE were the most important Heavy rock in the 70's essential. Though both bands were quite different."
3,Decent,"The 1984 Whitesnake ""Slide it In"" band was actually in transition to what was to become the biggest selling Whitesnake band in the early 1990s (with new guitarists and others) ""Slide It In"" however is respectable with newcomer John Sykes (Thin Lizzy) laying down remarkable guitar along with veteran blues slinger Mel Galley, and Jon Lord, Neil Murray, and Cozy ""I'm dead now"" Powell. Coverdale's songs are good, too, most being written with longtime partner Galley, and one with venerable ex-whitesnake guitarist Mickey Moody. Hooks are everywhere and Coverdale just seems to along for the ride as this is a top-notch act delivering a formidable sound. Of course, it all sounds a bit dated now, but such as life. If you don't know it, get it. Production is very good and stills cranks loud very well."
3,cheap wrist straps,"the price was right, they do work, the clasps as noted in other reviews don't lock, but that no biggiemy only bugaboo is that I can't charge the remotes with these in place, as the short section that loops into the remote, is too short, and causes the buckle to push the remote off the charging pins"
3,Wrist Strap Review,"These wrist straps are everything a wrist strap should be, with the exception of the tightening clip, which is a simple sliding square with no lockdown device. I remedied this by adding the clip off my destroyed original WII wrist strap, and all is well. I think I payed $0.99 for 4 of these, so it solved my 'wrist strap destroyed by the vacuum cleaner' problem."
5,couldn't ask for anything more,"this is a great product and perfect for the wii remotes or other electronics. i actually got them for use with my digital camera because the camera strap did not have a clasp. even though these do not have a locking clasp they work really well. the quality of the straps is really nice, they are thick yet they have a little bit of give to them."
5,It's not what you think.,I didn't actually use these straps for my Wii remotes. I tied these to the seat belt on my wheelchair so I can hang it on the back when i'm not using it. They get the job done.
