4,GOOD,"this sound track is good, not quite as good as the film, but still is good. The music are really cool. I would recommend this cd."
2,Not worth it,"This may purport to be a self-help book or a reasonable gift, but it overdoes the minimalist approach. Even with 74 pages averaging less than 50 words a page, the book belabors its point.If you're looking for philosophy, The Precious Present is awfully basic. If you want a book to read, this will leave you unsatisfied within minutes. If you're looking for a gift, the recipient could well feel you didn't put much effort into it."
5,Book Review,Many thanks for getting this book to me so much more quickly than expected. The book contains an age-old message that all of us need to hear. I gave it as a gift to my Sunday school teacher who developed a New Year's lesson for us. I've used it many times as a special gift and highly recommend it.
3,It was okay,"I thought the book was pretty silly actually. The love conflict between Darcy and Austin kept enough of my interest to finish the book but there were times when I was ready to be done and move on to something better. I absolutely hated the ""Holy Seduction"", ""Holy Moley"", ""Holy Crap"", ""Holy Sexual Tension"" phrases....they really got on my nerves. I honestly don't think I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Junk food reading, but good junk food reading :)","I can't explain why I like these books, I just do and I know they are what I would call junk food of reading but I really like them and enjoy the characters in them. They are funny and fun to read. They aren't PG books but they aren't written in a raunchy style either. They are just good fun. :)"
5,This Book Left a Lasting Impression,"First of all, I read this book about a year ago. It is 1 of maybe 20 books about bicycle touring that I have read. Some are good, some are just okay. This book by far has exceeded my expectations. It is extremely well written ... it keeps your interest from cover to cover, and it provides incite for those who would travel by bicycle.Other books share their experiences, some the details of their trip, and some have a combination of the two. But ""We Passed This Way"" includes these and way more. It shares this historical perspectives of the route and places they encountered. They also share the trials of the road and what an extended time with good friends can mean. I truly was moved once I finished the book; it was like I was parting with them and the journey as if I had traveled with them.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in extended bicycle touring!"
4,Inspiring,"I can't think of a better way to see the country and to get in shape than to take a cross-country bike ride. The author of this book shows that while it is not the easiest thing to do, it is not an impossible task. The historical references add to this story, and had me longing to be out on the road with them. What I look for in a travel book is to be pushed into a longing to join them or duplicate their trip. I found myself wanting to do this during this book. An easy and enjoyable read"
1,Bad Idea,I thought this would help me remove old cracked glazing. No way! It did little more than rub it real hard. It was hard to control as well. Do yourself a favor and get a Dremel tool with a cutting bit. Or try a Rotozip like tool. You need one of these anyway! I have both and found the Dremel tool easier to control alowing me to quickly remove glazing. I also scratched the surface of the wood giving me a new wood face for the new glazing. Look at it this way. How much Dremel tool would the cost of this putty rubber pay for. I wish I had read these user reviews before I wasted my money.
1,should have listened to the other reviews :-(,"by far the worst purchase I have ever made! now you CAN make it eat some putty, the problem is it will also eat the wood. it is meant to act as a ""bearing bit"" that follows along the wood. BUT the surface you are bearing against is the putty it self. Therefore you have to ""free hand"" into the putty to create a bearing surface on the wood, of course you will most likely nic or even destroy the side of the wood in so doing. and once you do get to the wood the ... oh never mind I hope you get the point by now."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Samsung is the WORST. We bought this TV in August and it was delivered in September to our new house. We opened it on a Sunday, plugged it in and watched it for a while, then on Monday it would not come on. They thought it was a lamp, but that didn't fix it so they came and got it to service it. We bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no TV. They decided to replace it since they couldn't fix it. That was three weeks ago. Now they are giving us the runaround blaming shipping/warehouse/etc for the delay in sending the new one. During a phone conversation with Samsung they basically said they were so far behind on shipping because they had so many to ship out (ie lots of them have problems and are being replaced is the way I took it.)"
1,Very Pissed Off,"Amazon said they had this in stock on July 12 and only received it today, on July 28.Hooked it up and DVD's using Sony HDMI upscale player look horrible! The picture got worse and worse.The bulb burned out after 3 hours of use!!!**I am now being told that it will be 3 weeks before they can send a service tech to change the bulb!"
4,Well priced alternative to plasme,"Very good HD picture, easy controls. Deep cabinet not as practical as plasma systems, but the price is just right. Get matching table."
1,Must not be from NY - major league Rip OFF,"I purchased this backpack for my 4th grader. He has used it for only 5 weeks and the shoulder strap has ripped completely from the bag and there is a tear in the top of the bag. Very poor quality!! Hoping to get my money back... The last Yankee back pack I purchased lasted 4 years.UPDATE****The company ""L J Back Pack"" that sold me the back pack refused to refund me the $$ or exchange for a new one. My son used this no more than 5 weeks - that is less than 25 days with holidays. Major League RIP OFF."
3,Good for quick looks.,"This viewer is excellent if you don't want to see the image enlarged. The light is great, and I can find nothing wrong with it. Basically, if you don't want to take a closer look, this is for you."
3,"System error, annoying cap design","Got a ""system error"" problem 30 days after purchase. Made the camera totally inoperable. Also, the lens cap design is flawed. You have to manually take the cap off in order to use it. Audio on video also lacking. Otherwise, it takes very good pictures; shutter delay isn't so bad either. Still, had to send it back to Nikon for repair."
1,Unimpressed with camera/service,"I bought this camera based on online reviews. For 6 months of use, the camera performed adequately, although I tired of:1. Waiting for the camera to turn itself on (about a 10 second wait)2. Waiting for the camera to delete individual pictures ( a 3-4 minute wait)While on vacation, the camera simply quit turning on. After talking to Nikon, I had to send the camera to California for service at my expense. So, I had three weeks of vacation with no digital camera. Their service convinced me that they do not stand behind their products. I would not purchase another product from Nikon."
2,Save your money,"This is the first digital camera I have ever purchased, and I have learned a lot since then.1) Avoid cameras where the lens extends outward from the body! These are prone to many problems, ranging from impact to debris effecting its performance.2) Make sure the camera suits your purpose, test it in the store if you can. If you want a camera to capture action, this IS NOT the camera for you.For simple snap shots, this is not a bad camera, for action it is virtually useless.I now have a Nikon D50, which is infinitely superior, and worth the extra $$$."
4,"Great point-and-shoot camera, best for outdoors","I bought this camera and took it on a trip to British Columbia the next day. We took pictures for a week, and when we returned, were blown away by how good the pictures turned out. Fantastic color, easy to use, even good night shots.Later I've used the camera more indoors and there I do see some weaknesses -- I have not been able to get flash shots that measure up to the outdoor shots."
3,Used but serves my purpose,Got everything just as advertised -- camera has seen much previous use but still operable as a backup to my primary Nikon 4300 and its specific optical lenses.
5,Brilliant camera!,"I bought this camera about 7 months ago, so I would have something to capture the moment of my first childbirth, and I'm still amazed at how well this camera performs. I keep finding new aspects about this camera that put it over the top. But instead of naming all the good qualities, let me just hit on a few. The clarity of the photos I've taken is just simply astounding! Features, features, features! I still haven't gotten it all figured out. The only knock on this camera that I can think of would have to be when I take a picture in the Hi res setting. It seems to take forever. But that could also be the memory card as well. This is probably the best point and shoot short of a professional camera."
1,Beware of the first two reviews for this book,"""John Goodman"" and ""John C. Trewolla"" only have one review apiece, and it is for this book, and they are both from 'Kansas City' and they both give the book '5 stars' - evidently the author does know something about marketing ;)The author is from Kansas City."
3,Not his style,"No doubt about it, Kelly Joe Phelps is a powerful artist. But his power is best showcased with acoustic solo guitar. Kelly Joe does not repeat the intimacy he showed on his album Lead Me On. I was disappointed, not because his performance values or skill were in any way diminished in Roll Away The Stone, but because I wanted more of what I heard in Lead Me On. I felt that Kelly Joe was bored with his former style, and wanted to experiment."
3,"Bouncy, catchy pop for the summer!","I listened to this in Ireland in May 1998 - it's a fun song, with elements of bubblegum mixed with reggae. I found that it grew on me over the 10 days, and I came home thinking this is a great song for summer... especially if you visit the beach!"
1,pathetic,"my favourite record as a young stripling was a crackly worn out black vinyl pressing of ""we're only in it for the money"" so when this disc came out in 1985 or so, i snatched it up. but what happened to my memories? fz remixed it into a mess. what a disappointment. i waited another decade to buy the less butchered (but still wrong) version,We're Only in It for the Money, that finally replaced this & i still have both.i gave it one star but that's only for ""lumpy gravy"" for which i haven't such a sentimental attachment - ""we're only in it for the money"", in this remix, gets zero stars. not polite to speak ill of the dead, but what the ---- was fz thinking when he created this mess?"
4,Did Anyone Else Notice This?,"I was listening to We're Only In It For The Money in my basement and I realized:Phase 1: We're Only In It For The MoneyPhase 2: Lumpy GravyPhase 3: Civilization (Phase III)Frank even put it on the album in a speech bubble ""Is this Phase 1 of Lumpy Gravy?"" and on Lumpy Gravy ""Is this Phase 2 of We're Only In It For The Money?"" We're Only In It For The Money and Lumpy Gravy Have a song in common, ""Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance"" (Just ""Take Your Clothes Off"" on Lumpy Gravy)If you are a Zappa fan and you don't have any of these albums BUY THEM NOW! and listen to them, back to back to back."
5,Alex Zappa Fan,"This remaster is simply great. Sound quality is all why you are paying twice the price for this cd, buy if you are Zappa fan, this should not matter. This is the milestone for MOFI to release gold Zappa remaster.Needless to say that several noises missed from 90's remaster will not substitute for overall picture of superior hi-fi sound."
5,classic zappa: wierd and wonderful!,there is absolutley nothing that i can say to describe the odd genius of zappa. all i can say is the songs on this album make me think of wierd funky fruity cartoons.
4,Great but I wish FVZ hadn't changed it from the original,"Being a 'Zappa NUT' I must admit that I LOVE this CD and play it in the car repeatedlyBUTThere are changes from what I remember from having listened to the original vinyl MANY, MANY times many years ago and I prefer to hear the music as it WAS. (I guess I'll have to dig through my piling system to get the original vinyl and capture it on the computer if I want to hear what I want to hear.)"
3,Interesting to a point,"Someone once wrote that this album was a parody on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (by the Beatles, for the younger readers who wouldn't really understand -- get it! wink wink), and Zappa acknowledged that point of fact in later interviews. Officially and with validity (Zappa interview) this qualifies as a Zappa parody, one of many, his bread and butter. Personnally I like the ""Shut up and play your guitar"" collection better than anything else, and I like some of the mid-70's releases. But We're Only in It for the Money, doesn't really float my boat. Art wise, it was part of the canon of Zappa, and shouldn't be ignored by the ardent collectors or musicologists out there in search of the meaning of Zappa's life. So have at it."
5,Quick and Fresh!,My biscotti was sent in a very timely manner. I believe it took about two days to get to me. It was nicely packed and extremely fresh. Thanks Amazon!!
3,Naturalizer vs. Clarks,"Nice shoe, well made, but it didn't fit me right. Ordered a wide and it didn't fit like the Clark's do."
3,Hillman Carpentry,As a framer I don't know how I've got along without one. What a time saver for cutting rafters or any racked lumber. Just keep an oil can by your side. The only problem was after a few months the bar wore out and the entire tool just got sloppy.
5,Must Get NOVA mini-series!,It's a great 4-part NOVA mini-series about the origins of the solar system and life on earth. Scientific information is presented in an interesting and clear manner. Suitable for kids as well as grownups. Simply wonderful!
3,Origins,"There are two DVD's the first is outstanding the second is not nearly as great. However, I'm really glad I purchased this DVD.."
3,"Ono,what was I thinking","The death of John hurt me so much,I even bought this alum by Yoko Ono.When the first number, ""Goodbye Sadness""came on,I was shocked to hear how good Yoko could sing.Its a great song,produced by Phil Spector.I'm glad ""Walking on Thin Ice"" is included on this new version.John was killed coming home from the studio while working on this record.Its a great Disco cut,and the highest charted single from Yoko.""NO,NO,NO""with the gun shots,shows what risk Yoko's willing to take.Everyone was talking about this song.Its the only way Yoko could get on with her life,through her work.I have to admit,I'm not into this type of music,and I never bought another Yoko Ono album,but ""Season of Glass"" is one of her best recordings.Also,alot of John's songs,like ""Imagine"" was Yoko's idea,but wasn't given song writing credit."
3,Hope the Rest Are A Tad Better-,"I very much like the time travel premise and thought that Reflections of Toddsville was nicely writen (save some typos...who proofs Hollie's books anyhow?) and it ended superbly.So I was looking forward to the second in the series...it's got a wonderful - intriguing plot and I enjoy that very much...but why the heck does she have to overdo the sex? Enough already- the story is good enough to stand on it's own, if I wanted a purely romance novel I'd just look for that instead!"
4,A great add on,The 6000L is a great add on to my Rousseau 6112 extended wing. Both seem to work fine with the Rousseau 2950 portable miter saw cart.
2,Works well but breaks easily,"I bought this product for my son's AT&T; Samsung SGH-A707 SYNC. The item was extremely cheap, so I figured I'd get two at once.Well, they worked perfectly out of the box - the problem is, both units failed within a week and a half of use. Real bummer."
2,"Watch out for the ""POP""","As others have said, my unit makes a very loud ""pop"" or ""crack"" when you pause/stop/play or advance the tracks using he adapter and the Blackjack. Two stars, however, for uber-fast shipping and doing (basically) what is says it does. I am waiting for Eforcity to get back to me with a resolution to the popping problem. Perhaps a replacement, as others are not reporting this issue.Alright, after fast service from Eforcity, I received a replacement. Same loud POP. I think this is limited to the BlackJack (i607). I do not recommend this item for the Samsung BlackJack. Get something else."
4,Amelia Peabody is my hero,I have read the majority of Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series (I have yet to read the two newest in the series) and was delighted to find them available for Kindle.Long live the Emerson family!
5,matroxG450,Could not put two dual graphics cards in my Dell 545. The matrox G450 allows 4 monitors for my stock trading and works well. Graphics not great but for financial charts fine. Far cheaper than anything else through Ken's. Highly recommend for my purposes.
4,Great Saw,"This is a great product. Well made and accurate. If it had a blade indicator showing where the blade would cut, it would be a 5 out of 5 item.I addressed the concern to Safety Cut and their response was to offer to sell me a $200 plus lazer marker. Seems a expensive to me. They should offer a mechanical blade indicator."
5,OriginalFan||,"I'm Teddy's original fan. Not from Love Monkey, but from his first time he played on the radio. I went to his show and wish the guy all the support, 'cause I love him. Good Luck, Tedhead. |||Carrie loves you."
4,Like a mini version of John Mayer,"Teddy Geiger has an amazing, sort of ""mellow and soothing"" voice and he can play his own instruments-the guitar and the piano-a definite plus. He totally sounds like John Mayer (note the title of this review), and he is not one of those ""pop-y"" (if you want to call them that) boys. His sound is-I don't know if this makes sense, but he sounds mature. I melt for any guy that can play the guitar and Teddy Geiger is one of them; if I could listen to him play and sing his catchy songs all day, well that would be just completely awesome. If you like the John Mayer genre, you will definitely like listening to Teddy Geiger and you should buy his music."
3,Strange.............but good.,"This is one of the strangest Zappa albums that I own, and he Frank has some strange stuff! It is almost worth buying just to have Lonesome Burt the Cowboy. That song cracks me up every time. If you are buying your first Zappa album, I would suggest picking either Apostrophe, Zoot Allures, or Strictly Commercial. If you have never heard Zappa before, this album can kind of freak you out. It is really a good album though."
2,Flo and Eddie ruined the Mothers!,"Instead of buying this sad excuse for Frank Zappa's genius, go buy something he actually put musical effort into, like Burnt Weeny Sandwich or Weasles Ripped My Flesh. While this CD and the movie can be very entertaining, it's mostly lewd, crude, immature sex jokes done by Flo and Eddie (the former singers from the Turtles, who rode off Zappa's career when the Turtles broke up...or Zappa rode off theirs, it was mutual.) with little room for the wonderful instrumentals Zappa should be known for. At least when Flo and Eddie left the Mothers Zappa began writing music to his humor (see Apostrophe). Much of this is dialogue, more spoken than sung, so you don't even get good melodies."
5,What I expected!,I use a lot of these wheels and I find the straighter I cut the longer they last. Put them in a twist and they break.
5,zappacious!,"Zappa proves, beyond all doubt, to be an composer extraodinare on this masterpiece album. his virtuoso guitar work is evident in every rockin' note of Chunga's Revenge, the title, and very first, track - this track is two songs really, like many of Frank's songs!"
4,ZoneAlarm Internet Security SWEET,"Pros - Does a great job of protecting computer from the ""evils"" out there. Works mostly in the background.Cons - Slows system performance a bit conpaired to Norton origonally installed on laptop. Pop up alerts with AOL annoying at first. Not for the novice."
1,Major Disappointment,"Had been using ZA-PRO for years. This ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite product severely bogged down the entire systems...on all three machines I installed it on. Uninstalled it, and back to normal. ZoneLabs is unresponsive to any of my inquiries.I W-A-S a happy customer of ZA."
4,Works as advertised,"I was tired of Norton Internet Security slowing down my PCs. Consequently, I thought I would try ZoneAlarm. I was pleasantly surprised. I will stick will this product from now on. In addition, the 3 users package handles all my home PCs with one purchase at a lower price."
4,Minimal complaints,"After reading the disappointing reviews on MacAffee and Norton, I opted for Zone Alarm. So far, I haven't noticed many problems, though at times I cannot access certain websites, which is frustrating. Works quietly in the background but does slow the system down, mine was by approximately 50%. I bought this in conjunction with Spy Sweeper and they seem to interact seamlessly."
4,Fun and goofy! Sense of humor required!,"This may not be one of Goldsmith's best (and this is a short score, alas) but it is great fun. Where can you find music that fits that desperately-needed Japanese/Jazz/Baseball niche? He does it all - combines the baseball theme, a jazz element, and a Japanese sound, all in one score. Come on! Not everyone can do that! But Goldsmith does. It's great fun!If you are a Goldsmith fan, you'll want this in your collection. You never know when you may need some Japanese/Jazz/Baseball music, after all!"
2,Sub-par Hitchcock,"I feel that this is Robyn's weakest CD in years. There are a couple of good songs (like Television) but most of the CD is very unpolished. It almost sounds like Hitchcock had a recording session set up and had to very quickly bang out a few songs. So we are treated to some rehashed roots and blues structured songs with some psychodelic window dressing. Hitchcock's lyrics can be very quirky but I've never found them to sound forced. Here they sound very forced to me. I also wish he would leave the Dylan covers for whatever private parties he might be playing at. He does a very straight version of a Dylan song on this CD which of course begs for a comparison. Hitchcock's version does not compare well. If you are a Hitchcock fanatic buy this cd, for the casual listener there are better choices."
3,a doppleganger space opera,"Space empires and wars of conquest aside we have here a sort of undercoverhero from a small expanding empire.He is a strange sort of hero who falls for his woman bodyguardand although he is third in line for the crown, she would rather be a mercenary captain than his wife back home.Having two jobs and two titles is made more difficult for the hero Miles when a cloned double shows up.I might like to read more of this series as the writing is pretty good,but a sci fi goes there is nothing new or interesting about them."
3,Not Bujold at her peak,"I would not recommend anyone reading this as their first book in the Vorkosigan series. Instead, start with Shards of Honor (availible in the double novel Cordelia's Honor) *OR* The Warrior's Apprentice (availible in the double novel Young Miles), which are the foundation of the story of the series.This book was written relatively early in Bujold's career, and it is far from being her best book. I have only read this one once. I view it as dark comedy, as I really cannot take the amazing coinsidences which occur in this book too seriously.The immediate sequel to this book, Mirror Dance, is astounding, so I'm glad this book was written.This just isn't one of Bujold's masterpieces."
4,Great Live Zappa,"""Carolina Hardcore Ecstasy"" is reason enough to buy this CD-- the line ""She put a Doobie Brothers tape on/I had a Roger Daltry cape on"" pretty much sums up the dating and rock scene in the 1970's in hilarious fashion. (Not that I'm old enough to have experienced either). Also, the spoken word interludes by Captain Beefheart are well-placed and surprisingly entertaining. I'm not sure this is as good a Zappa starting point as Over-Nite Sensation (which would be the definitive ""introductory"" Zappa album, unless you want to start chronologically), but if you already think you like Zappa, buy this one."
2,not up to standard,"This coffeemaker is alot more tempermental than a second one I have at home. I bought this for my office, and most times it spills over, if the lid isn't closed down all the way, it brews coffee with a ton of grounds in it. It definitely is not Cuisinart quality the way I know it. I guess maybe next time I will buy the best coffeemaker Cuisinart makes (like the one I have at home) and skip the cheaper models."
2,just OK,"Item was just OK, nothing great. Was looking for something a little classier, for wearing my new charge tti, ( as it's about the same size as the wave ). but is not the case. didn't quite measure up to photo, so won't be using. Just chuck it up to a poor purchase."
3,OK Wave leather sheath but nothing special,"The sheath I received had a date of 2011 on the packaging, so this is its newest incarnation. No country of manufacture is given, but possibly USA made. It has good, but not industrial strength stitching holding the parts together. The main shortcoming may be the belt loop, which is too narrow for many jean belts, and is fairly stiff. I pulled out a 20+ year old (non-Wave) Leatherman sheath, which was larger, with thicker leather, had a far more generous belt loop and was held together by rivets. This new sheath looks attractive, but I doubt it will last 20 years."
4,For the New Wave,"The new Wave is very tight in this sheath when you first get it. The tapered end is the end that must be placed in the sheath for this to combination to work. There is a lot of friction when trying to pull out the Leatherman. To fix that I placed the wide end of the Wave down in the sheath and left it overnight. The next day, although very difficult, I pulled out the Wave, and reinserted it with the narrow end down. It now works great, and the sheath isn't hurt nor deformed. I think it looks much better than the modern Leatherman sheaths. The reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the flap is ever so slightly crooked, and it was like this when I first got it. Since I'm probably the only one that would notice, and because I don't wear it openly, even on the rare occasion that I wear it at all, I don't mind keeping it. I like it."
4,its barney,"its barney so if your kid loves barney, they will love this barney dvd...my barney fan does but as with all things barney, it may drive you crazy :)"
4,Very Good,"At first we weren't too sure about the ""new"" Barney. All the other episodes we own were of the old/original Barney and kids. But our kids don't seem to mind.I like that there is more than one episode on this dvd. I think there's actually 3. And lots of options.One thing I didn't like, is I thought that it being called ""ABC"" would mean they'd actually go through the Alphabet. But in the whole video, they don't say all the letters. They do a couple letter activities (spelling Baby Bop's name), sing a letter song (with only about 10 of the letters in the song), and sing the alphabet once.My recomendation would be, if you're wanting a video to help your child learn their letters, this is not the one to get. But if you just want a good Barney video for your child to enjoy, go for it. And if they happen to pick up a little bit of letter recognition, great."
2,not so great,"I was a fan of this company's food bars at first but tired of them quickly. I think the green label is misleading. If you look there is no vitamin A in these which tells you how little wheatgrass spirulina etc is actually in them. I call these nut butter bars because that is the number one ingredient on most of them and there is actually little nutrition as far as your rdas if you look at the label. On this particular formulation the #1 is almond butter, so if you think almond butter is super yummy and you can't get enough this is the bar for you. Of course they also include the flavorful brown rice protein extract. I'm really not into these bars anymore but will continue to eat one every other week or so until they're gone because they're paid for. Athletes might think they are the shiznit I wouldn't know"
2,Biassed and no clear criteria for coverage of composers,"It is not only the exclusion of composers but the fact that there is no indication of the criteria used for including or excluding them or for the depth of coverage given. There is no way to infer why are ,for example , Don Gillis or the author himself given more than twice the coverage given to Mauro Giuliani, just to mention something that can be found from page 143 to 146. There are plenty of examples like this. There are 8 works by Mr Gilder, and less than a dozen works by George Philippe Teleman, none by Tartini, Giusepe Torelli or Johann Pachelbel...! I really felt disappointed with the recomendation of this book."
5,Impossible to find something better than this!!,I already wrote a review on this incredible musical event after watchingthe show on DVD so my opinion on the CD version cannot be different.The only sad thing about this is that both Doug and Freddy are not withus anymore but we have their wonderful 1990 Austin Texas concert andwe can either listen to it or watch the incredible musical abilitiesof this foursome. The best Conjunto Tex-Mex rock & roll gathering ever!!!
2,"Great NOVEL, but has huge historical errors!","This is the first book I read about Tzu Hsi, and I found it totally engrossing. After reading a number of other, more recent biographical works on her reign, it is sad to see how so many very false assumptions about her (upon which Pearl Buck bases many of the key assumptions of this novel) have created a very distorted view of her as an individual, a leader, and particulalry as a woman.Pearl S. Buck writes in her Foreward ""I have tried to portray Tzu Hsi as accurately as possible from available resources...."" and this, unfortunately, is the book's biggest flaw. The scholarship was often totally false and grossly distorted, and so western writers perpetuated many false assumptions about her.Read Sterling Seagrave's Dragon Lady if you want a more accurate portrayal of her."
5,Showing the Best for Oral History and Memory Research,"Throughgoing in pioneering scholarship and artistic in execution, this unique wife-husband collaboration advances the art of oral history, butresses the case for using memory and recognition in histories, and reads like a fine novel. Thanks to Alice's interviewing craft, Howard's rich memories of his varied WW11 experiences are validated. Oral history techniques are thereby improved, and the reader is treated all along to a very good read. Bold in conception, careful in completion, the book will reward all curious about the strengths and limitations of recall and recognition as scholarly aids. Any others open to learning more truth than ever about war will also be well rewarded"
1,"Worked great, until it didn't.","For the first month I had the fan, it worked just fine. Then one day it slowed down, and then finally stopped. If I give the 'blades' a good spin, the fan may start up sometime, but it slows down again in a matter of seconds. Stay away."
5,Great music and hilarious,"I'm surprised the reviews for this album aren't better. In my opinion after The Allman Brothers live at the Filmore this is the best live album ever! Its hilarious and the musicianship is awesome. I bought it a few weeks ago after not hearing it for a couple of decades. I figured I would listen to it once or twice but I've been listening at least once a day. The songs mock rock stars, groupies, and life on the road. Unlike some reviewers I love Flo and Eddie. They have excellent voices and a self deprecating style that is a perfect fit with Zappa. Only caveat is that there are a couple of lines that are a bit misogynistic. My daughter likes Zappa too but I'm not playing this CD for her."
5,Mudshark,"I've been reading all these reviews of the various Zappa albums and which ones best and blah blah blah. I've been into Frank since 77 at the NYC baby snakes shows, 78, 79 ,80 81, 84, 88 EVERY album IS THE BEST at one time or another!! Period! The filmore album smoked back in 78 on a phase linear amp with ohm speakers, it was like being at the filmore! Is it FZ best?, on that night it was. If you are into FZ there REALLY is NO BAD ALBUM. Those who are know what I mean. Music is the best.....FZ"
2,Mixing bowls?,VERY disappointed in the size of these bowls. The picture is VERY misleading as they are almost miniscule in size and definitely shouldn't be referred to as mixing bowls.
5,Gospel Hip-Hop Amplified!!!!!!!!,"This album is, by far, the most gutta, lyrically sharpp, all out soul saving music in the streets right now!!! Corey Red is down right gritty and passionate with his Biblical delivery. Precise is the epitomy of a Soldier for the LORD. HOTT!! Praise The Lord and Savior, which is none other than JESUS CHRIST. He is definitely reaching the masses through this music."
3,Corey Red are by far the best except...,"I like Corey Red and Precise. In fact I love their lyrics. They are so real and they are not sugar coated. There are a few problems, not anything to big though. I think people give this CD a high rating because they are one of the few good gospel MC's out there. The CD is too overrated. Two, it seems like Corey red dominates every track except a few. In my opinion I like Precise better so that is a minus for me (maybe not for you). Three, the beats are mediocre. They have ok beats but they are not as good as secular beats (in my opinion). I like Emenim and I can say without being bias that many of his beats are better than some gospel rap beats. In a nutshell you can buy this CD or not buy it. The choice is up too you!"
1,never received,I ordered this product and never received it. I also wrote the company asking why and never received a response. So I was ripped off for the price of the product. DO NOT BUY IT!!
4,Fun and easy to do,"This is my first pregnancy, so I want to remember as much as possible. I figured there is no better way to remember my stomach than to cast it, so I bought the casting kit. We laid the drop cloth over a chair, filled a pyrex with water, and got working (well my boyfriend did- I just sat there). It was incredibly messy, but very easy to do. We were able to pop the cast off in less than 15 minutes and it was fully dry a day later. Also, there was enough material leftover to do at least one more cast, so it might be fun for others to do one cast in both the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I am excited to have my belly cast and the next step for us to sand it and decorate it. I highly recommend this to all pregnant women who want a special way to remember their big stomachs."
5,The Best Little Prybar,I first found this pry bar about 10 years ago. I have had one in my tool box ever since. I have lost a couple or may they have just walked off but they were always replaced as quickly as possible. I work as a home improvement contractor and these sand up to the day to day abuse. In fact I have had this last one so long that it is beginning to wear out. I recommend these to all my buddies and customers that are into home improvement projects. I think these are well worth it.
5,Bridge Buff Review,"This is a great product for playing bridge alone on your computer - exactly what I was looking for. I am able to generate many different types of hands. I can automate the bidding and play or manually step through them. For each bid, opponents and partners, there is a description of what it means. I really like Bridge Buff, it is helping me become a better bridge player."
2,"Okay Labels, But Wastes Label Tape","You loose 2 inches of label tape with every use. Shame on Brother for such a terrible design or, as I suspect, a design intended to force the purchase of more tape than should be necessary."
1,font size stuck ridiculously small,"Mine worked pretty well for about the first 50 labels that I made. Then the font size got stuck ridiculously small so that the message only covers about 10 percent of the tape surface. If you want really small labels with a hard-to-read font size, you could use my PT-1750 to print them out and then cut down with scissors to eliminate all of the wasted label area."
5,Good multi-use labeller,This is one of the best P-touch labellers I've used. The (pseudo) QUERTY keyboard makes it wasy to input text. Functions are clearly labelled and easy to reference without a manual. Five size and multi-line text and 9 memory locations to save frequent printed labels. Also quick access to change tapes on the top.The Amazon price is great as well. You won't be disappointed!
2,Fine except that you have to trim your own lablels,"I like everything about this product except for one thing: unless you're happy with a margin of about two inches on each side of the text, you have to cut each label by hand. It does offer narrow margin options, but when you use this option, you just get a dotted line on one side that you have trim along. What a pain!"
1,poor diction,lynley is fine but his partner is impossible to understand. Her dialog may as well not exist. fortunately we only bought 1 dvd.
2,Picture is wonderful! But again anouther Bad BULB!?,"I have owned my Samsung HL-S4666W 46"" almost 1 year as of today (9-15-2007) I have been already thru the Bulb and 2 other repairs within my 1st 3 months of ownership. After being informed from the repair company that This TV needs lots of rear venting to keep bulb and components from over heating, Imoved it away at least a foot. It now all will last at least 7 months instead of 2!?Trust me when I say there are better choices out there! And those that purchased need to inform Samsung of a potential problem with this TV!!I am one of the fortunate ones that have 12 days left on the TV WARRANTY!The TV has a great picture directly in front of it when working! Sitting on the side blurs, and Bulb reliability is BAD!"
2,Problems after 18 months,"HDTV doesn't look nearly as good on this TV as it does on a good HD LCD or Plasma...but this is cheaper too. After 18 months, my TV will suddenly turn itself off, and won't turn back on. It went a week without working at all, then worked fine for a month. Samsung won't cover it under warrantee.Bottom line, when it works, its fine for the price....but I'd by an LCD or Plasma if I did this over."
3,Great For the Price,"This TV is great for the price - but be careful where you order from. My tv finally arrived from amazon today and when the guy took it out of the box there were broken parts visible through the screen! So he had to take it back. Remember that there are places out there that let you return your tv up until 30 days - at amazon they deliver and hook it up - if it works - then after that it is up to you. Breaks on day 2 - you deal with Samsung. Trust me, you DO NOT want to deal with their customer service department, I spent a whole summer attempting to get a different Samsung fixed.Nonetheless, I purchased this tv because 1080p tv's are twice the price and if you want a good tv - wait until 1080p LCD's lower in price down to the 2500k range. Currently they are around 4000k. For the price, you get a decent HDTV that is light and easy to move around. Good buy, just be careful where you buy from."
5,dremel sanding discs,"Top-notch. Just what I would have expected from Dremel. These little discs are easy to install and use. they have many uses, in my opinion."
3,Jim Ugly Just OK,"My book review is about a book called Jim Ugly. The author of this book is Sid Fleischman. I thought this book was confusing.I didn't like it when the author skipped from one event to the other. An exciting event in this book was when Jake looked all around for his dad. Finally, the best part of the book occurs while he is looking.My favorite character was Jake because he never quit searching for his dad.I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend because it was too confusing and hard to follow. However, if you want to find out what happens next, you can read the book."
2,Knife okay... pouch is useless,"As a long-time owner (50 years +) of Victorinox Swiss Army knives ( I was gifted my first knife by a Swiss friend for my 12th birthday), I was disappointed with this package deal. I ordered two, one for a friend's son as a graduation gift and one for myself as a replacement for a recently misplaced Explorer. Why the disappointment? The pouch is useless: the knife does not fit the pouch, it sits too high and you cannot secure the snap on the cover. The hand-lens, (one of the reasons I value this model along with the cork screw), is now made of flimsy clear plastic, not the classic gray solid framed lens shown in the Amazon advert. If the lens breaks, as it surely will someday, it will be impossible to replace. The knife itself otherwise met my expectations. Nevertheless, I am very disappointed that yet another quality product seems to be slipping into junk oblivion. Please Victorinox, say it isn't so!"
3,A Discovery For Sure,"After listening to ""Christopher Columbus: The Discovery"", I discovered something about Cliff Eidelman about the way he writes epic music. As well as in ""Star Trek VI-The Undiscovered Country"", Eidelman begins using his orchestra in full to state the theme for the main character -in this case, Columbus. However, in the middle of the statement, the orchestra calms down, leaving the listener wondering why he/she wouldn't continue playing the theme with the full orchestra. What I say is clearly demonstrated on 'A Hero's Welcome (Epilogue)'. The main themes for this awful movie are very good, but Eidelman never lets the music speak the heroics of Christopher Columbus at full as in any epic music such as ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman-The Movie""."
3,Great Audio - Video a little weak.,"I'd agree with the others that the venue, song selection, and audio quality was very, very good. Sheryl was definitely at the top of her game this evening. The only shortcoming was the video which at times ranged from washed out to overly saturated, and the deep HD focus just wasn't there. It actually looked at times like they took a SD video and tried to sharpen it. Certainly not horrible, but on a big 60"" Kuro it's a little lacking."
2,Kind of Chincy....,"I was pretty excited to find this pendant because my husband loves the Yankees. I bought this as a Christmas gift.Well, after about 5-6 of wearing it, we noticed it had tarnished terribly on the side that was against his skin. The description states that it is Rhodium plated, but I have to truly wonder if it is, or how much, with the way the pendant current looks.My husband has worn other sterling silver jewelry continually without issue, so I don't think it's his body chemistry reacting to the metal.To be honest the metal looks as though I had bought it from a corner drugstore. I would not recommend this, for the price; it should not be looking like this after 6-8 weeks of wear. I looked into the return policy on it, and it's just too much hassle."
3,Too wide,"If you have the Super Leatherman, this sheath is too wide for the tool and will rattle around inside of it."
4,'Secrets' thrilled me to the end!,This is the sixth Adler book that I have read and I was thrilled to the end by the suspense and lifestyles narrated by Maudie. I guessed before hand who the killer would be but it was still a great read. I would also like to see this made into a movie. Great period scenes and costumes would make this a box office hit.
4,All positive,I am a 68 year old male and I really enjoy the music from this album. The movie was great too!SteveB.
4,Study Guide,"I bought this for my husband at his request. It was recommended to him. You have to buy the answer key separately and Amazon doesn't even carry that. For the price paid, it should be included. Without it you can't check your work, but my husband says it has been helpful."
1,"Concept okay, theology very weak",The way the author used scripture to support his argument was pathetic
1,a big disappointment! very low quality,I wish I could give zero stars. I bought this for my son so he could get used to having his blood pressure taken. His younger brother (2 1/2) chewed off the rubber part on the syringe and the ear piece of the stethoscope. It is supposed to be for two and up. The beeper sounds like a smoke detector so is worthless unless you want to think your house is on fire all the time. The stethoscope won't stay together and the bulb came off of the blood pressure cuff! I have tried contacting the company at least three times (no email) and no one ever answers the phone. I guess they know they have problems. Save your money and buy something else!
4,The KREW Is Great For Kids,I recently experienced The KREW at a Family Fest in California and I have to say it's a great video for kids. It teaches them about the dangers of talking to strangers and encourages them to make smart choices when it comes to avoiding them. I would reccomend this video for any parent with kids ages 4-11. I can't wait for the second video!
4,Educational and Fun!,"After attending a Matisse exhibition I was eager to pass on my love for his paintings to my young nephews. This book is so effective in teaching them about the artist that even I learned a couple of things. So,if you're looking for a fun way to introduce young kids to art this book is a good tool. This book will give kids a friendly overview of who Matisse was and what motivated him to paint. It'll also show them ""kid versions"" of his most famous paintings. It's such a fun book that I recommend it for adults as well"
4,Excellent,An excellent children's book if introducing art related material to a young group. I have used this with my toddler group and they loved the pictures and story.
2,disappointing,"I bought a dutch translation of this book, and was rather disappointed. I wanted to learn more about xhtml, to be able to work on my own website, and not having to ask a friend for every little change I wanted to make.In my opinion the book clearly lacks good editing work. For instance on parts where certain elements are introduced, the authors start elaborating on styles. This complicates things a lot, because explaining styles should be reserved for the chapters that are devoted to it.Where it says in the first chapter that layout and content should be separated, they give examples where there is layout mixed with the content. This doesn't make it easy to develop my own writing of html.The meaning of document type definitions didn't become clear to me, because they use different type definitions throughout the text. So as a beginner I can't follow any more...I'll do my best to go learning with this book, but if you still have to decide which one to buy..."
5,I LOVE JEFF HARDY!!!!,"This DVD is awesome. I am a WWE fan, and a Jeff Hardy fan. This DVD has his most famous matches, including the fabled first TLC match! It displays all his high-flying ring maneuvers and includes scenes/info regarding his personal life. What I really like is that the DVD contains some of Jeff's favorite things, from fav. tv show to fav. music group! Its very detailed."
5,Great for my son,I bought this for my son for Christmas 2009 and he loved it. He said it was just what he wanted. Everything was in it that was advertised. Amazon was the only place I could find it.
5,Where's this Dinah-Moe Coming From ?,"What a band this was ! If you can handle the satire and the scatalogical lyrics, this album will please. Remember that Frank used the latter to amplify the former. This album is solid front to back, filled with classic tunes. From Camarillo Brillo to Montana, we are repeatedly slapped in the face with reminders of how fickle the human condition is. If you're not into that stuff, just check out the instrumental excellence - killer guitar solos by FZ and incredible violin solos by Jean Luc Ponty. What a band. Essential."
5,Concept music at its best,"'Overnight Sensation' is unquestionably one of Frank Zappa's greatest albums. It's a shame that their are only seven songs on the Album. What you have though, is three of Zappa's greatest songs on one disc.The music and lyrics of 'Montana' are compelling, 'Dinah-Mo-Hum' is Zappa combining brilliant music with autobiographical lyrics, which will could make you die with laughter. The finest song on the album though, and one which none of the other reviewers have noted is 'Camerillo Brillo', I cannot eulogise enough about this song. The lyrics are quirky,amusing,eclectic, and absorbing, the combination of guitars and piano is pure poetry. I believe this to be Zappa's greatest song and i'd buy the album just for this song.Lyrics from this song 'She had a snake for a pet and an amulet, and she was breeding a dwarf but she wasn't done yet!'. Buy this album!."
4,Viva Zappa!,"This is another classic from Frank Zappa though somewhat late in his career. It is impossible to find on iTunes so purchase of the CD was necessary. The overall misogynistic message is offset by the laser like humor of songs such as ""I'm the Slime [on Your TV Set]"" and ""Montana."" Lines like, ""moving to Montana soon, gonna be a dental floss tycoon,"" are unforgetable."
2,Warning to Airport Users,"The authors had not seen an Airport Card nor Base Station when this book was written. It merely parrots Apple's prerelease publicity. Big disappointment, if, like quite a few of us, you need Airport trouble-shooting help. The rest of it is fairly superficial. I recommend finding a book where the author has actually used all of the equipment."
5,So THAT's what I've been saying all these years!,"Excellent book. Though born and raised in Hawaii, Cantonese was my first language. During trips to Hong Kong and Guangzhou to visit family, my Chinese was understood perfectly and they marvelled at how well I spoke colloquial Chinese, but I never realized I wasn't speaking ""proper"" Cantonese, until I read this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone desiring to learn the usage and context of Cantonese as spoken on the streets of any Chinatown in the U.S. as well as Hong Kong & Guangdong."
3,The Mothers Novelty Album,"Although I like this album I dont consider it a true Mothers album. It focuses on the 50's Doo-Wop side of their influences and lacks any of the over the top musicianship and production of their previous three albums. It seems to have been recorded just for the fun of it. Nothing wrong with that! ""Jelly Roll Gum Drop"" is a classic Mother's tune. 3 1/2 stars!"
1,Horrid Writing - Embarrassing Editing,"Caravaggio was a great painter. And this book is equally bad. The following excerpt is but one of many examples that can be found on almost every page:""Prospero certainly did this for M, and maybe convinced M to leave the Cesaris after he got out of hospital (sic). Bellori agreed it was Prospero's encouragement that decided (sic) M to go it alone."" (from page 44)"
3,M for Mystified,"M takes you into political intrigue, a Machavillian world where art and money and power and murder combine to make an interesting read. Caravaggio was and remains one of few artists who brings to life his subjects, from the poor, the criminal to the sinful. Robb's book shows that M stands for modernity of Caravaggio's works; M stands for the magic touch in Robb's pen; and M stands for the Macabre in Caravaggio's world. However, whether M stands for Michelangelo Merisi in this book is debateable. Robb has written a book shrouded in mystery, lunacy and darkness of Caravaggio's time, but it seems he may also have shrouded the man himself."
1,Pure Imagination,"As Amazon organizes reviews by date, the sole review (writen by noted Caravaggio scholar David Stone) which attacks this book for its unscholarly tendency to unashamedly make things up is buried deep on the last page. Therefore, I thought I'd add another to make this fact a little more visible to the casual shopper. A few others have noted the appalling grammar and syntax, but the real crime is the baselessness of Robb's conclusions. Does no one care about evidence any more? Do none of you who loved this book find anything wrong with Robb's practice of examining complex, vague, and contradictory sources, choosing the most dramatic answer possible, and presenting it as an irrefutable truth? Caravaggio was an unconventional, brilliant man who lived a wild and crazy life--stick with the evidence and you'll still be amazed."
2,One last breath...,"One last trumpet blast from Chris before he packed up his toys and sold out for good. Enough to make a cat weep, what a waste of talent!"
5,Helpful,Very informative and detailed. It goes hand in hand with the reference manual Business Security. Both books are perfect for HR issues.
1,Nothing is Free,"There is a reason these are being sold for this price. Unfortunately, you can't see the date stamp until you open them. The ones I purchased in Oct, 2008 had a date of Sept, 2002.If you want to get full life usefulness out of a smoke detector (10 years), you would be wise to shop at your local hardware stores, where you can see the date before you buy."
4,basic wireless battery operated smoke alarm,"this was a perfect replacement for what we had the last 10 years in our home. same size, brand and bracket. easy to replace. we figure it worked well for 10 years (always goes off when I'm cooking...but that's another story).....it works...and that's what we need."
2,Stay Away From This Band,"I first heard Breaking Benjamin's first single ""Polyamorous"", at first I thought it was some sort of a joke, the lyrics of this band could use a little work. You have to give them props for at least trying but the boring vocals and guitar we've all heard a million times on the radio doesn't cut it. I would advise to stay away from this band if you truly value music, it's obvious this group is set around the ages of 13 to 16.STAY AWAY!!!Go buy ""Black Sabbath"", ""Metallica"" or at least should I dare say ""Cold"""
5,amazing,"great cd! I first heared Breaking Benjamin at a show up here in maine and was amazed, these guys are kickass! I didnt know any lyrics before hand yet i quickly picked them up as they played. Right after the show i bought We're Not Alone and listened to it non-stop for two weeks. Then i found this and had to get it too. I like heavy bands like Children of Bodom and SlipKnoT but Breaking Benjamin does it for me every time. Great bass riffs too, for all you fellow bassists."
5,Breaking the Ice,"This is the CD you've been waiting for! Packed with every emotion blended into thirteen songs, Breaking Benjamin shows the talent to combine edge and melody into one beautiful package. From the upbeat, ""Skin"", to the kick in the head, ""Sugarcoat"", each track manages to bounce back and forth in itself. They each showcase melody and dynamics to the full effect a rock band can offer. What more could you ask for? One listen and you'll be hooked, trust me. This disk has been playing non-stop since I bought it. Go get it now."
5,This is a great cd Great Band,"THis is a great cd, one of the best ive heard in a awhile the first three songs are awesome and the others are just as good i would have to highly recommend this cd it is well worth the money."
1,El Stinko,"As is typical of misguided religious zealots like GW Bush or the Pope, Dobson relies on outmoded, ignorant ways of thinking to defend his arguments about gays. He is a prime example of why all of us should be suspicious of the medical profession. His thinking is repugnant; the cover of the book, with the wedding ring in CROSSHAIRS, is a disgrace. Shame on you Dobson. I'd rather go to hell for eternity than be in heaven with people like you."
1,"HITLER WAS RIGHT, THANK YOU JAMES DOBSON!!!","Kudos to Dobson for blowing the lid off these scheming queers. Might I also recomend The Big Book of Jewish Conspiracies by Joshua Neuman; cuz you see ""Like Adolf Hitler, who overran his European neighbors..."" the author also fears the unknown and thinks gays have no better way to spend their time than to ""implement a master plan to utterly destroy the family"". Better idea, buy Mein Kampf and replace the word jew with gay, it'll be pretty much the same book."
1,Who paid him to write this trash?,"You may have heard of a James Madison who, in the Federalist No. 10, warned us by saying:""The purpose of the Constitution is to restrict the majority's ability to harm a minority.""If the author had read The constitution before writing his book, he would understand what James Madison also called the ""Father of the Constitution"" meant.He meant that the constitution is to open rights to citizens and not limit them, he meant that people like James Dobson should spend their time reading the Constitution and try to open their minds instead of writing a hateful,odious, shameless and monstrous book trying to DESTROY our precious Constitution.The book is not worth spending a dime on. None of the arguments will convince an educated adult.What kind of monster is he to jeopardize our Constitution in order feed his biggotry?"
2,Tenor Uke light,"The Amigo isn't realy large enough to be a Tenor: 15 frets rather than 17+, nut to bridge length just under 16 rather than 17"", overall 24.5"" rather than 26"". Actually closer to a Concert than Tenor.Mine came with 2 wrapped strings like a Baritone uke, way too low for a Tenor, so it really didn't work at all well as delivered.So, I bought a concert string set, salvaged the smallest wrapped string for a lo 'G' and made it into sort of a 'Contralto' Uke, tho there is really no such size !But I had fun doing it ! Appears well made, & considering the very modest price, 2 stars !"
5,Love This New Re-Release!,"The new re-release of Frank Zappa's brilliant The Grand Wazoo is nothing short of wonderful. I've been buying them all in order (Overnight Sensation is next!), since they started coming out in July of 2012, and they've pretty much all been an improvement over the previous CD versions. I have to say though, that I don't know what some of these other folks are talking about when they say their copies of this CD won't play on their CD, DVD or blu-ray players. I had no problem playing it on my (Bose) CD player at all! Maybe there were problems in the manufacturing of the disc at first though. Because $35.00 is a ridiculously high price to pay for any single CD, even one as great as the Grand Wazoo."
1,Horrible,This company should be sued for false advertising. The buttons are *not* programmable. You can't assign macros nor something simple such as 'shift' to the buttons. This is not a gaming mouse. You'll have to get the mx1000 if you want 3 side buttons.
4,Great buget mouse,"1600 dpi is nice. There's a handy button that switches the DPI of the mouse right under the mouse wheel. The three buttons on the side are all programmable And for games you can set them to anything you want to do.Its a little bigger then most mice and may take a bit getting used to (maybe kids will have problems using it).In a fps I usually set the buttons to: reload, Voice chat, Use(open door)."
4,Excellent bargain gaming mouse,"No replacement for a logitech G5 rev.2 if you have one (like I) but is a nice mouse to have for my gaming notebook. 3 thumb buttons, on the fly DPI adjustment, fits pretty well, cool red glow. Don't need to install the drivers on the CD, just plug'n play!"
3,"Introduces Carlotta, pretty typical female PI book","Having read and enjoyed several of the later Carlotta Carlye books, I thought I'd check out this first book. As a first book goes, it's solid but not stunning. Carlotta and her supporting cast (crazy artist roomie, cab drivers, ""little sister"") are all interesting enough. The plot seems a bit contrived. The blues music interest doesn't quite ring true. It's as if the author was told to give your character and interesting hobby.Bottom line -- Don't go out of your way to read this book but at the same time, don't let it put you off from later books in the series, some of which are great reads."
2,Pass,"I am a big fan of Piers Anthony's Incarnation of Immortality series, and read a lot of the Xanth novels as a kid, but when I read this one years ago...horf. The dialogue is stilted and odd, much like his other books, but it works in those because of the paranormal/fantasy element. Here it was just incredibly off putting to me. The premise was a very interesting one, but I would have to say this book made me stop reading Piers."
4,Buy it for Black Napkins!,"Black Napkins is the best guitar solo ever! Buy this album just for that song, especially if you like Muffin Man, Watermelon in Easter Hay, Shut up and Play your Guitar. The rest of the album goes down easy, sort of like Apostrophe. This is the first Zappa album I ever bought, and it turned me into a lifelong Zappa fan.However, if you are new to Zappa, start with Joe' Garage. I feel sorry for the Mothers fan below who gave up with this album and never made it to Joe's Garage."
3,Complete Picture of the Horse's Back and How it Relates,"this is a thorough study of the horse's back. Every bone, every muscle and the functions are explained in this book. Also discussed are ways to keep the back functioning properly. The author explains what to look for from the horse's body actions that might hint to pain from the back. It's a good book and one that you can read again about eery 6 months to a year...for a refresher."
1,Doesn't Pour!,"I've had this coffeemaker for a couple of years and have spent the whole time looking for another carafe. The one that comes with this machine doesn't pour without dribbling water or coffee everywhere. So every time I fill the reservoir or pour coffee, I end up with liquid all over the counter. I've tried every trick I can think of (pour slowly, pour quickly, pour slowly and first and then faster, etc.), but nothing works. Making the pouring lip deep and wide enough to pour cleanly seems like such a basic of coffee pot design that I can't quite figure out how the Cuisinart designers got this one so badly wrong. But since I can't find a different carafe to fit this machine, I'm finally giving up and buying another coffeemaker. Too bad, because this one is cute and makes decent coffee."
5,Coffee pot serves purposes,The Cuisinart DCC 450BK was purchased for my mom and disabled sister. They just need a 4-cup size and it doesn't take up a lot of counter space. The stainless carafe is great because it won't break or crack if accidentally hit while filling or cleaning. Works well and makes a decent cup of coffee.
2,barely hot coffee,"One problem with the DCC-450 - it doesn't make the coffee hot enough. If you drink it black and immediately, it might be hot; but add a little milk or drink with your morning paper and you'll have to re-heat your cup in the microwave. Too bad. Otherwise, I like the design & compactness."
1,defective,"Bought it a couple of weeks ago and had to deal with spills and other small but irritating defects. Well, this morning it stopped working altogether. Avoid."
1,very disappointed,"I got a Krups 4 cup coffee maker as a wedding gift, it lasted 15 years. After a couple cheap $20 makers that lasted a year each, we thought we upgraded to this. Within 2 months the hot plate was rusting, now less than a year old, the hot plate has rusted through. For some reason, coffee doesn't all go into the pot. Some, just a little, runs down the side onto the hot plate. Unfortunately, it is enough to rust it. I also hate the way it pours. I now keep it over the sink, as some coffee always runs down the side and drips off the bottom when pouring. One star is a compliment, only because zero is not available."
5,"little pot, big value","we like to take our own coffee maker when we travel. This fits the bill. Small and safe with the stainless carafe. We are very satisfied. Now, no one has to run to the lobby to get that morning picker-upper!"
1,Spill city,"I can't pour a cup without the pot drizzling behind onto the counter. So, I pour over the sink. Mind you, if you pour like a little old man/lady (which should be easy for me given my age), you can make it work sorta. But only if you take maybe 30 seconds to pour a cup."
2,Horrible Carafe/Pot Design,"I will start with this coffee maker was free to me because a coworker bought it for us to share. The coffee maker makes pretty decent coffee. However, the pot is so hard to pour without spilling. It drips down the side of the pot when you pour and on to the floor or surface that you are pouring over. I have tried for months to master the correct angle to pour coffee but to no avail. IT always spills or drips on the floor or counter. I will be purchasing a replacement soon that is not so poorly designed."
4,Quite Like It,"Maybe they redesigned it, but I haven't had any of the problems that the one star reviews cited. I love this little coffee pot. I recently downsized from a large house into a small condo and this is just the thing.No clocks to set, no complicated buttons where you have to hold it down for 10 seconds and hop on one foot while reciting the U.S constitution. Just pour in the water and press the button, then it turns itself off in 20 minutes.I'm especially amused by the clever water level indicator on the inside of the reservoir."
1,Poor Product Engineering. Don't Buy It!,"As a fan of Cuisinart products, the manufacturer as well as the elegant looks of the coffeemaker and durability of the metal pot compelled me to purchase this coffee maker. I thought I had the best of all worlds; I soon found I did not! The spout is poorly designed and spills coffee everywhere except in the cup. It performs like that gag gift known as the ""dribble cup."" What was the product engineer thinking? Didn't they test it? From time to time the water also stays up in the filter unit and you have to jiggle the pot to make if drip down. If I had to do it again, I would not have purchased this product. If you decide to buy it anyway, make sure you buy paper towels in bulk. Sorry Cuisinart!"
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I BOUGHT THIS COFFEEMAKER BECAUSE OF THE NAME ""CUISINART"" BUT HAVE SINCE HAD BETTER PERFORMANCE FROM A $9.88 NO NAME COFFEEMAKER. FIRST THE COFFEE POT DRIBBLES WATER/COFFEE ALL OVER THE PLACE - YOU NEED TO GET A GLASS OR SOME OTHER CONTAINER TO POUR WATER INTO THE THE COFFEEMAKER UNLESS OF COURSE YOU DO NOT MIND WATER ALL OVER YOUR COUNTERTOP AND WHEN IT COMES TO POURING THE COFFFEE INTO A CUP YOU BETTER BE STANDING OVER THE SINK. BUT THAT'S NOT ONLY WHERE THIS COFFEEMAKER FALLS SHORT - IT DOES NOT BREW A REALLY HOT CUP OF COFFEE AND THE HEATING PLATE TURNS OFF TOO QUICKLY. IT IS NOW SITTING IN THE CLOSET - I JUST COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT BUT I PROBABLY WILL WHEN I DO SPRING CLEANING."
2,Can't pour and not spill water or coffee,"It has all the 5-star features and use. The carafe just can't pour any liquid without some kind of run or spill. We've tried with/without lid. We've tried wiping the spout dry before pouring just in case it was physics. We tried pouring slower at first and tilting more as water leaves the carafe. And no success. It doesn't happen all the time, but more than half the time the carafe will spill or drip.I've resorted to using a glass Mr.Coffee carafe to just fill the water reservoir.If you get one that doesn't spill, please post a response."
1,It leaks when pouring,"I have revoked my earlier review with 5 stars.After making a couple of dozen pots, it now leaks when pouring. Otherwise, I like it. But there is clearly some bad design in exactly how the plastic upper lip is attached to the top of the stainless pot. Simple enough to always put a towel under when pouring or pour over the sink.Since posting this review, the leaking got so bad that I finally returned the product and have gotten a similar product from a different manufacturer. (with a thermal carafe)"
3,Cuisinart DCC-450BK,"PINK MODEL. 1.5 year usage.PROs: Perfect Size, No complicated settings (h2o, filter, coffee, go), Auto Shut off, Stainless steel carafe won't break & easy to clean. CONS: carafe design flaw causes it to spill coffee no matter what angle or how fast/slow you pour. OTHER COMMENTS: the pink color will show coffee stains after prolonged use (GET BLACK) if you're OCD."
1,Makes weak coffee,"I like my coffee fairly strong, and this coffee maker shoots waters through the filter so quickly that the coffee is always pretty weak, no matter how much coffee I use."
1,So much potential but falls short.,"I agree with all of the reviewers that rated this poorly. I liked the size of the coffeemaker, since I'm the only one in my family who drinks coffee, the automatic shut-off, brew-pause feature, and the stainless-steel carafe, but the carafe leaks coffee when you pour it and I mean LEAKS, not drips. You lose nearly half your coffee pouring it. Clearly, a poor design issue and should be recalled. My brew-pause feature no longer works. This coffeemaker also doesn't seem to make hot coffee. My coffee comes out warm and if I use milk forget it, it's pretty much a cold cup of coffee. Such a disappointment."
1,Very poor design,"If a company like Cuisinart can't design a coffee pot that will pour without spilling it's contents all over the counter, should I buy any of their other products? (I think not!) How could they have NOT tested this product to see how it pours? There is no way to pour from this coffee pot, except to allow just a tiny trickle of coffee to leave the pot. Pouring it fast doesn't work. Cuisinart can do better -- or maybe they can't."
1,Leaks EVERY time I pour a cup,"This pot makes a great cup of coffee - but neither I nor anyone else who has tried can pour a cup from the pot without it drooling all over the counter, or floor, or where ever.Finally gave it up - too messy to use."
2,Leaky coffeemaker,"Not worht the $30 spent on it. The coffee tastes alright and at the right temperature, but the carafe leaks EVERY time. Would not recommend."
2,Disappointing product,"I bought this product two years ago; at first I was satisfied with its performance, but during the past year I have encountered the same problem other reviewers have mentioned: when pouring the coffee after brewing, steady leakage occurs from the carafe. This causes a puddle of coffee on the countertop (and less coffee in your cup). It's now so bad that I have to pour the coffee into the cup over my sink, to catch the leakage. This is very disappointing, considering Cuisinart's reputation. I love my Cuisinart food processor (I've had the same model for almost twenty years), but cannot recommend this coffeemaker, which I am replacing ASAP."
1,Not Hot,The water is only heated lukewarn to the point that coffee is noticeably weaker than other coffee makers.Can't recommend.
1,Poor design and expensive,"I bought this coffee maker hoping that the Cuisinart brand meant good quality and design. The device does make good coffee, but the stainless carafe drips -- a lot. Apparently, the plastic rim around the top of the carafe causes coffee to spill. I've taken to pouring coffee over the kitchen sink, so I don't have to spend as much time cleaning up. You can spend much less and get a coffee maker that is just as good and less of a hassle to use. I'm going back to my faithful and dripless Mr. Coffee."
2,"5 oz. ""cups"" are NOT cups!","I just opened my coffeemaker, all excited to have coffee again after the last one broke. I figured even if someone else came over, 4 cups would be enough for us. Sure, it would have been.. if 4 ""cups"" in Cuisinart-land really meant cups. However, it means 5oz. Normal cups are 8oz. That means that this coffeemaker can make 20oz, or 2.5 normal-people cups. Definitely a trick marketing ploy in my opinion. Why not be more explicit about it on the box? Or use a different word from ""cups.""I'm only doing the research now and the product has been discontinued from Cuisinart [...] .Hmm.. the coffee isn't that good either.. :-("
2,Another dribble pot,"This is a cuisine art pot and I had high expectations. Boy was I mistaken. You cannot just take the lid off the carafe to clean it, I have to use a knife to pry it up every time. It has no hinge for the lid. Also, when you pour your cup of coffee, it dribbles on the counter and requires clean up. I do not recommend this item. The coffee tastes fine, but the hassel with the lid and the dripping makes it a big NO!"
3,Some flaws worth considering,"I've had this for about 9 months and I don't think I've ever quite liked it. I'm shocked to read that some people think it doesn't brew hot enough. My warmer plate runs so hot that by about the time the carafe has enough coffee for a cup's worth, it has already made the coffe almost hot enough to boil. I always have to wait 5-10 minutes after pouring myself a cup before I can drink it. I never had this problem with my old black n decker.The stainless steel carafe is nice to clean but I agree about the spillage. I always pour over the sink.It's built well and seems like it would last forever, and you can get the filters for it anywhere, but I'm online right now to replace it as it is."
3,DRIBBLES ALL OVER,"The coffee from this product tastes great, but every morning I have to deal with the mess that the carafe makes when it dribbles all over my counter. It is really annoying. We can send people to the moon, but we have coffeemakers that dribble all over our counters...."
2,Poorly Designed,"This feels like one of those products that was never tested before it was released. It's not that it's a lemon, it's just that using it day to day, you discover it's packed with a myriad of little annoying features.Here's a few:When you pour from the coffee pot, it almost always dribbles down the side, spilling coffee everywhere.The coffee pot doesn't slide easily into place.The top lid doesn't close down easily or secure properly.It's four tea cups of coffee, but only two standard mugs of coffee.Because the pot is stainless steel, it's hard to know when the coffee is done and ready to serve.There's no indicator that the coffee is done and ready to serveActually, that may be all of my complaints, but really, that's everything this coffee maker is supposed to do. How can you screw up everyone of them? I guess the power source works okay."
4,"Not super, but adequate","I've never really owned any coffeemaker before, but this one seems okay. If you just want to have a cup or two at work, this is a good deal for the $$. The filters are easy to find anywhere. It doesn't take up much space. The coffee tastes pretty good to me. Its a little cumbersome pouring the water into the reservoir because of the lip on the pot, but you don't necessarily need to use that because inside the reservoir it has lines for the number of cups that is easy to see. One thing is, if you don't use the coffee up in a certain amount of time, the element shuts off automatically and the coffee may go cold before you get to it. Other than that, I would recommend this, its a great color, makes pretty good coffee, no real problems."
1,Useless machine - surprising for Cuisinart!,"We've been using this coffee machine for the last few weeks and astonishingly it took less than a week for it to start malfunctioning: the Brew-pause function which is supposed to allow for a quick pour DOESN'T WORK. If you try to take the pot out to pour 'a quick cup' there's a mess on the kitchen counter.We would certainly have returned it, as money 'doesn't grow on trees' but its too much of a bother and we need a coffeemaker. I will be buying a different one soon."
3,not what I expected,After reading the reviews I expected this to be an outstanding coffee maker thus far all I can say is that it makes coffee. The pause and pour does not work and it keeps on dripping when I pull the pot out to pour a cup of coffee. When I pour into my cup the spout dribbles onto the counter. I now wait until the coffee is brewed and pour it into my cup over the sink which I can live with but it's not what I expected.
2,Coffee Tastes Like Plastic,"Although I always clean a newly purchased coffee pot before I use it, cleaning didn't do a thing to this one. The coffee tastes like plastic - very disappointing.I have had many Cuisinart products over the years and this one just doesn't hold a candle to the others I have owned.Unfortunately for me I threw away the box and cannot return it.What a waste of $32.00."
3,Look closer,"Don't be deceived by the stainless steel carafe. It's not thermal insulated. I was incredibly disappointed and surprised when I opened this up and found that it sits on a burner. Burners burn! This may be acceptable to anyone who buys their coffee ground in cans, but real coffee enthusiasts will be unsatisfied with this appliance. Gift shoppers: if your recipient buys coffee fresh, then they are out of this machine's league."
2,Poorly designed,"As other reviews have noted the carafe is not insulated and is very poorly designed. The contents drip down the side no matter how carefully you pour. Leaving the lid on while pouring works better than taking it off, but either way have a rag ready. There are better options. For $10 less you can get the 4-cup Mr. Coffee which works just as well without the mess."
1,spillage always a problem,"I wanted to like this coffee maker because of the stainless steel pot, but unfortunately the problems outweigh the great advantage of a durable pot. The main problem is spilling--either from the coffee brewing so fast that it overflows the paper cone, or from pouring as carefully as possible and still having spillage from the spout. If I can find another small pot with stainless pot I will ditch this one ASAP. Save your money for a better system; the 12 dollar cheapie at work is better than this one."
2,leaks when you pour every time,"Well, the coffee is fine, it doesn't stay hot long, but I like the small size and the stainless steel carafe. Downside, it leaks. Believe it or not I still use it, I just have to pour it over the trash can or a bowl (I have it in my office) because it leaks out coffee between the seam of the stainless steel and the black plastic carafe rim. This is a pretty major flaw, as coffee stains all over the place are not particularly professional looking."
3,Average,"This is a nice small coffeemaker, but the cord is too short, it is hard to fill the water chamber, and the coffee is not hot enough."
3,"Pretty good, but probably not worth the extra cost","This coffeemaker does make very delicious, smooth coffee, noticeably better than our old Gevalia maker. However the lack of any outside indicatory of how much water is in the machine or how much coffee has been brewed is a little annoying. Also, the brew pause feature, which was our reason for buying a new coffee maker, has been a little erratic and once or twice just hasn't worked! I don't know if this is worth the 10 extra bucks over the Mr. Coffee."
4,Good for the two of us,"This is good coffee maker for those looking for a small basic model that makes decent coffee for two. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it has the heat base which keeps the coffee warm for about an hour (a very useful feature!). It's not programmable, but it makes four cups in a few minutes so that's not a feature that's missed very much. The only gripe I have with this coffee maker is that it is difficult to pour out the last drops of coffee.If you're looking for a small compact stylish coffee maker and only need 2-3 cups a day, then this is a good choice. We also bought the permanent filter, which has been a good investment for us."
2,bad design for pouring,I have to agree with others who have found pouring a mess with this machine no matter how carefully you place cover and pour. Very disappointing purchase.
2,Makes Poor Coffee,"We finally gave up on the Cuisinart even tho it has never failed, and is a nice looking coffee maker. Why? Because, the water runs thru so darn fast that if you look at your coffee grounds, some are not even wet. Also, you better plan to pour over a sink as the spout is so small it will spill coffee every time. We grind our own coffee, and of course the grind can be a factor, but the best coffee maker we've ever used has been a Melitta four cup."
2,Leaks,"I was super excited because my entire kitchen is cook for the cure. This however, leaked all over my kitchen counter. I made sure the lid was secure, but it was leaking where the pink attaches to the rest of the carafe. So sad. Had to return it."
3,"fast cup of joe, but 1/2 of it ends up spilling on counter","this coffee maker is acceptable in terms of size, quickness of brew, temperature, and appearance. however, 75% of the time, regardless of angle of pour, speed of pour, or alignment of the planets, this sucker is impossible to pour without dribbling.**edit** for some reason, the caraffe has been pouring normally for the past 6 months. someone else had mentioned that the lid is affected by the heat of the coffee and warps slightly.....well, whatever happened, this thing is pouring normally now....."
2,Okay but a odd taste,"I purchased this item as it was red and perfect for just the two of us. It came in scratched, not bad but noticeable and but very happy about it overall, until we made coffee in it the next day. Wow the taste was simply horrid, tasted of plastic, maybe metal but it was a no go for us. I sent it back right away."
2,Carafe needs to be redesigned,"I bought this $29 coffee maker after first buying and returning a $10 Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee maker simply because they (Mr. Coffee) changed the filter basket. I went to 4 stores and couldn't find filters for a 4 cup maker (the supermarkets and CVC only carried the larger size).Basically, you are paying 3 times as much for the Cuisinart marque because they both do a fine job of making decent coffee. My beef with the item is that while the carafe is nice in stainless since one can not break it, it does a horrible job of pouring the coffee, i.e., expect to pour 8 oz. in your cup and an ounce on the counter. I wrote to Cuisinart and they never responded. I would rather go back to a glass carafe then constantly have to clean up the counter after trying to pour my coffee. This is the reason I only gave two stars."
1,"Every time I use it, it makes a mess",I have owned this coffee maker for over six months and I have found that it is imposible to pour from the carafe without it having it leak all over. I'm actually shopping for a new one when I found this same model and decided to leave the review. Save yourself the trouble buy another coffe maker.
1,forget warrenty,carafe leaked around the spout pouring coffee everywhere. called in less than 60 days - their response pay $10.00 or pay for the return of carafe.that is almost half the cost of a new one! ($29.95) - will NOT buy any of their products again
1,Dribbles,"I like the size but it usually dribbles onto the counter when I pour coffee. How on earth does a company produce this thing, see that it spills when pouring, dust off their hands, and say ""ok we're done let's sell it.""Fail."
4,Works just fine,"This label tape works perfectly with my Brother P-touch PT-70 label maker. The labels stick to plastic, glass, paper. They are just as described!"
5,The Riders in the Sky are great!,"Once again, the singers have done a great job! Loved the Woody's Round Up Album; this one is just as great!"
2,Pretty disappointed.,I bought this for two songs and they are both great. I was very disappointed with the rest. At least I can play Looking For An Echo and Magic Moments whenever I want.
1,Personel beliefs,I was disapointed that the author injected his personel beliefs into the story. One would have no idea that the writer was going to spatter throughout the story his religious thoughts. It should be noted somewhere on the inside jacket or outside on the cover that the book contains regilious thoughts. When I Purchase a Clive Cussler or Dean Koontz book I dont expect it to be filled with their own personel religious beliefs. I am a Christian but I get my religion each sunday in church. If I want it in a novel I go to the religious book store. The point is at least let everyone know up front before they buy a book that they may be disappointent in.
3,"Great book, bad ending!","Like the previous reviewer, I liked this book a lot. It was well written, gripping, basic good sci-fi. Then came the ending. It was so abrupt that I actually checked to see if a *chapter* was missing. I don't understand how a book otherwise so well written and well laid out could have an end which seemed like the author reached a predetermined page limit and ended the book (seemingly) mid-thought."
4,Baring the secrets,You thought you knew everything about the Presidents? Think again. Included are some offbeat material but most are fascinating things that leave you wondering why you never learned that before and Gee doesn't that make history more interesting?I highly recommend buying this book.
2,This book is boring!!!,I was anticipating some juicy tales to be revealed by this book only to find out the secret tale of John Quincy Adams was he liked to skiny-dip in the Potomac River? Isn't that located in the middle of Washington D.C and how secret could that be??? It was a waste of my time.....
1,horrible quality!!,it doesn't even deserve 1 star. but i cant write a review without highlighting at least 1 star. this is my 2nd power cable from amazon for my toshiba laptop. both of them literally fell apart while i was unplugging them. unbelievably poor quality. do not buy this!!
2,cheap plastic,"This adapter is definitely not the same as the original part that came with my laptop, in spite of the fact that it is made by Toshiba, and has the right part number. It's light and cheap feeling, and I'm sure will break within a year, which is disappointing for the price. However, it charges my laptop just fine, and thus keeps the old thing alive for a bit longer."
1,is not compatible with my toshiba despite verification of compatibility and model/sku number,"would most likely work if the actual plug would fit. whatever the case, it is not compatible with my toshiba laptop as it was advertised. I am extremely displeased."
4,"Skeptical at first, but working well...","I was skeptical after reading the wide range of reviews, but the price made it hard to pass up. We've had it for about two months now with no complaints. Yes, the cord is shorter than the original, but an extension cord easily fixes this problem. So far, so good!UPDATE 5/15/2012:This thing is STILL working! I give it BIG thumbs up!"
1,having issues,I bought this item in November and I'm having issues with it. I have to wiggle the cord all the time in order for it to work. There are no visible problems. It should last longer than 3 months. I hate the idea of spending more money for another one.
1,"Worked okay, poor craftsmanship","This adapter worked exactly as it should, but now only 4 months after purchase, the male end of the plug that goes into the computer has broken in half. The plastic just separated from the metal as if it had just been barely glued in place. I am very unhappy, since I now have to buy yet another adapter in order to use my computer."
1,Received the Item Broken,I received the item broken. I am still trying to get in touch with someone about return or replacement. Not happy at all with service or communication!
4,good value for the price,"Not exactly a ""universal"" adapter, but clearly designed to be compatible with multiple models. Works for my satellite a215. Has a 3 prong cord instead of 2 like other reviews have mentioned; also appears to have the same less robust construction. Works fine so far, but I'm definitely avoiding any excessive movement with it."
1,Only worked for 45 days,"I purchased the original Toshiba adapter thinking it would be of higher quality than an off brand adapter. I was wrong. As many other reviewers have noted, this adapter is poorly manufactured and will likely fail just after the 30 day return window. DO NOT BUY!"
3,lap top cord,"The cord is just a cord, functional and when you don't have one, renders your computer unusable. I'm happy with the cord and good price. I was disatisfied with delivery, it took longer that promised."
1,piece of junk .,Piece of junk. Just had the second one go on fire while my children were using it. Very lucky my children did not get hurt because I would be suing right now! Will never buy from amazon again.
1,Quit working after 3 months,"Product was OEM and looked exactly like the one that came with the laptop, but quit working after a little over 3 months and the warranty is only for 3 months (figures). Save your money and buy something else. Office Depot has a universal adapter for about 3 times the money, but it has held up so far and has a one year warranty."
3,Exactly like the other one,"So my last power cord broke only 4 months after having the computer, the wire right next to the plug bent and then it stop working unless you held it in place. I've had my new cord for about a month and it's always staring to get bent the same way, it still works without me holding it, and I don't think it's the fact that this particular cord is bad, I think just this Toshiba product in general doesn't last long, I've read a lot of other reviews about this cord breaking quickly, but hopefully it will last me a few more months."
2,Clear Ripoff,"This was functional but no improvement over the stock charger it was replacing (that quit after just a year and a half!). It was very overpriced, it should have been about 15 dollars at the most."
1,broke in 4 months..Beware!,The product stopped working after 4 months. The wires and connectors are really bad. The product will wear out in few months and will stop working. Cheaply made stuff. Won't last long.
1,Where can you get a jack that works?,"This one lasted 6 months and the last one I bought which was the same, lasted 6 months. It's a waste of money. Both worked fine for a few months, then they start to lose contact. You have to wiggle it or put your lips just right for it to work. DO MORE RESEARCH AND FIND ONE THAT WORKS. This is trash."
3,Bought this for my Dad,I bought this for my dad for xmas last year because he's a HUGE fan. dad seemed to love it and has watched it countless times.
5,"Well written. Thorough without smacking of ""college text.""","I was looking for a well-documented work that was yet not too technical for a normal person to endure reading, and this fits the bill. Talbot does a good job of making his point, gets right down to business without too much of the type of chattiness one sees in much popular non-fiction, yet manages to make it a compelling and interesting read. Thanks, Thomas! Now get someone to set it up for Kindle and I'll buy it again. ;)"
4,A MOST IMPRESSIVE INTRODUCTION,"By far, the very first theme - ""L'Adoption"" - is one of the most impressive ones I've ever heard. Just to listen to that track pays for the whole album. The rest is quite good, anyhow."
1,Self-Satfisfied Schmata,"Indeed the first reviewer couldn't have said it better. Quindlen suffers from self-involved, self-satisfied writing. She's so taken with her rather mundane reflections, average in their insight, and lackluster ""poignent moments"" she works so hard to construct, that she cannot see the inviting realm of ideas -- just out there, apparently beyond her reach.Ho Hum, Anna."
1,Received different product than I thought,No mad at the seller. Seller did everthing asked. Just mad at myself for not checking the product info better.
4,Fond Memories,My dad let me listen to this B-side vinyl when I was 11. Billy the Mountain remains one of the all time funniest things I have ever heard. I would reccomend this to anyone - it's worth whatever price just to hear it once. Trust me.
4,Great book,Expecting parents are always worried about the changes and what to expect. This book is funny and informative. It doesn't cover everything but it's still worth picking up. It's a great gift (I've given it a few times) or just a book to add to your collection. I aloso recomend the version written for men.
2,It's no Girlfriend's Guide,"This book had it moments, but beneath the humor lurks the same misplaced preachiness that makes most books on pregnancy almost unbearable to read. The author's list of forbidden activities is illustrative-- she claims you must stay away from microwaves (!), hair dye, coffee, chocolate, air travel, and all soft cheeses (including, presumably, even pasteurized cheese). I confirmed with my doctor that none of this is true (microwaves fine; moderate coffee fine; chocolate fine; air travel fine up to the last couple weeks; pasteurized soft cheese fine). It's this kind of widespread misinformation from non-experts, urging women to unnecessary self-abnegation, that makes pregnancy suck! Save yourself the undeserved guilt, and skip this one in favor of the more sensible Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy."
4,A Political hit for the most part,"This is a good CD for the most part. Randy Edelman did an effective job of driving the pulse of the movie with this music. Tracks: 1, 7, & 9 are my favorites. Although track 6 is nice also as it adds a very majestic classical touch to the collection and track 7 adds a very melodic caribbean feeling that's nice and soothing. Track 16 also does an excellent job of summarizing and accentuating the concept of the entire CD. I highly recommend this CD to those that enjoyed the movie. I give it 4 stars out of 5."
2,A Chinese-made Piece of Junk.,"While the notes are accurate during the time this concertina works, this concertina has buttons that stick, and notes that stay open even when the button isn't pressed.If you're thinking of taking it apart to try and repair it, good luck. The screws pictured above don't turn very easily. Obviously they weren't meant for taking back out. If you get them out, though, you then have to deal with the fact that the place to access the buttons is -GLUED SHUT-. So good luck getting in there.Also, I had to make a new hole in the hand straps to get it tight enough, but that may just be because I have scrawny hands.If you're looking for a cheap and affordable one to try to learn on, I'd pass on this one, even though it is a 30-button. Unless you can learn it all up on a day, it won't be worth the money ya pay on it. I guess I've learned from my experience though. (at least it arrived in a timely manner.)"
2,Only for readers with very limited experience.,"This book can only appeal to readers with very narrow experience, because all it can offer is easy to deduce for anyone with average intelligence. This book is cheap in appearance and content, even some of the illustrations are not consistent. Further, there is too much spinning of yarns on general topics and there is very little text on body language signs and techniques, very little."
4,great basic coffee maker,Not perfect but does the job well and makes GREAT coffee. Highly recommended.
5,Melitta Makes the Best Coffeemakers!,"This is one of the best coffeemakers ever! I especially like the ""fast brew"" feature--no more waiting for coffee when I'm in a hurry!"
2,3 year coffee maker,"It worked great for over 3 years. Then noticed a puddle of water and didn't know at first where it was coming from. Later my husband found out it was the coffee maker that was leaking all over our counter. A big puddle! Another down fall is it doesn't shut off once and awhile, we had to unplug it and plug it back in."
1,Awful!,"This is the worst coffee pot I've ever owned. It makes a *huge* mess everytime you brew coffee, with grounds getting everywhere. In addition, just 2 months after I bought it, it short-circuited and broke, with smoke billowing out of the unit. I liked the concept and the hot, fast coffee, but I never could get a decent cup of coffee out of this machine. I disliked it so much I'll never buy a Melita product again."
5,AMAZON saved the day!,"I looked EVERYWHERE for roach motels and couldn't find them. Finally, I thought to look on good ol' Amazon and there they were! They got to me just in time (kids were moving from infested apt to nice new clean one) and we didn't want any stowaways! These work better than any other product we've used. Thanks!"
4,A must have,Our old smoke alarm went off and we called the fire department to look for the fire. We were told that old alarms sometime go off even without the fire or smoke and should be changed about every ten years. We replaced ours with a similar model that fit into the old covers. We also learned that our model had a battery as well as electricity.The shrill sound of the alarm is awful but does make one alert to a problem. Since one alarm is always high up beyond reach with a ladder it can't be turned off quickly. I wish they had a turn off knob. We feel secure an hope we don't hear it again.
5,Great Replacement Smoke Alarm,"This was a no hassle replacement for an older Kidde smoke alarm purchased 4-5 years ago. It uses the same connecting system, so connecting to power and the ceiling fixture was a snap. Quite pleased."
5,Works like it is supposed too,"I bought a house that was 12 years old and that had 2 old and very yellowed smoke detectors. I replaced them both with this Kidde unit. It installed very easily. I turned on the power and tested each unit, they work fine. Several weeks later the units are working very well and not giving any errant alarms."
5,replacement smoke alarms,All our smoke alarms were at lease 15 years old and started to go off all the time for no reason. We found this product to be very easy to install and works perfectly with our system.
5,Fire Alarms,"These fire alarms are excellent and the last ones lasted the whole ten years as recommended. You don't know how well they work until you have a fire, so I hope I don't get a chance to see how they really work.I installed them very easily as the previous units were earlier similar models and all the wiring was already in place. Nicley done by Kidde as it made installation very easy to accomplish."
2,Touchy and Problematic Like the Kiddes I replaced,"Our old Kiddes were acting up, so we replaced them this these. Still having problems with battery alert alarms when the batteries are fully up to charge. Not really impressed at all."
1,Dissapointing,"This book was sorely disappointing. It begans good but somewhere towards the middle of the book the object changes and the story falls apart. Tyree Omar had a chance to make this book memorable but he chose not too. If you want to read a good thoughtful novel, read Resurrecting Mingus by Jenoyne Adams."
3,Give it a try if you can,Perhaps this just wasn't my type of read. I wasn't able to finish this one. The writing was a little stiff to me and I had a hard time getting into this one. I had a hard time swallowing the dialogue and the situations. Perhaps it gets better later on. I just wasn't able to hang in there to see.
2,This one is ok,Leslie is one of those books that starts kind of slow and picks up in the middle and then it dropps off at the end. I felt like the ending didn't make sense and that the character Leslie was somewhat unbelievable. I know some people do go over board with power but I didn't feel this one. Borrow this from the library. Save your money.
4,a little unrealistic,"the book was great and all, but the author kind of ""jumped the shark"" with the whole killing thing. i mean seriously, a girl who seemingly has it all together and is a serious college student just starts murdering people because she can? and what were the odd that the police department was THAT good that they would link her to all the crimes. also, to have her brother kill himself was totally unnecessary. he just didn't seem like the type. it would be nice to have a sequel because the end just left you at a cliffhanger"
3,"Leslie shows potential, but falls short in the end.","Tyree's novel tells the story of a mysterious college student named Leslie and her three roomates. Long story short, Leslie finds out that she is a voodoo princess, and when she does, she uses her new found strengh to take revenge on her enemies.This was a book that intrigued me to the very end. The main problem I have with this book is the fact that the reader tends to become less and less interested in Leslie (who is not likeable at all by the end of the book) or her family (who are also not likeable at all). By the end of the book, I was honestly more interested in the maturation and growth of Leslie's roomate Ayanna Timber. Still though, this is an interesting read with a great cast of characters that will keep you reading until the end. Unfortunately, I feel like the end is a cop-out and this book deserves more closure than we got."
3,Getting Better.... Full of fluff.....,"I thought this book was better than Tyree's previous two books. Mr. Tyree has been slipping.He spends too much time describing Leslie's mysterous disposition. I could not wait for him to get the story started. You could read the first chapter and skip to page 150 & U would not have missed a thing. Tyree needs to ease up on the fluff a little.It gets exciting towards the end. However, the ending could have been much better. It leaves you hanging like there may be a part 2 in the works. Who Knows..."
2,Hard to use.,I WANTED BUY A GOOD CASSETTE PLAYER SO I BOUGHT AN EXPENSIVE ONE. BAD CHOICE. VERY DIFFICULT TO OPERATE. NOT WORTH EXPENSE. I HAVE HAD MUCH CHEAPER SONY MODELS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. MANUFACTURES INSTRUCTIONS MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN JAPANESE AND THEN TRANSLATED INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER LANGUAGES BEFORE MAKING IT TO ENGLISH.
2,Didn't make my clear orly topcoat any thinner.,"I love orly polish, but my top coat thickened, making it very difficult to apply. I purchased this because the topcoat was still more than half full. I have put in over 20 drops, over a couple of tries and there has been no change in the consistency of the polish."
3,works ok,This worked ok but i feel like it went right back to the same thickness fast so i mean it worked for a second but thats really about it
2,Lightweight Craft Knife - Poor Catch,No roofer's knife here - just a lightweight craft knife that would get a higher rating from me if it didn't have a tendency to open up when you retract the blade. Almost always have to fully retract the blade then nudge it forward a bit to make sure the handle is locked - what a nuisance.
1,Don't waste your money or your time...,"The ""author"" wrote a sloppy piece of garbage that isn't well written. Filled with rumors, inaccuracies and conspiracy theories by a right wing wacko. This ""book"" deserves negative stars. The ""author"" is known for being on the Howard Stern Show and walking the streets of Hollywood acting mentally ill."
5,Love this movie!,This movie is great... my 4 year old love the Loch Ness Monster and anything that is scary w/ big teeth. This is his favorite.
3,okay but not all that is needed,"After purchasing this review book, I realized it was just an older version of the book I had already purchased. Question by Question. Thought it helped a small bit but should have looked into multiple sources for review."
5,"Great book, great condition, great service",Book arrived on time in described condition-couldn't be more pleased!
4,Fun outfit.,Cute outfit my grandson just got his yellow belt and this will grow with him as he receives his other belts.
5,I LOVE this lunch box,"My little boy loves dinos, and he going to fees so BIG carrying this around to have lunch with his sister at school! ROAR!!!"
2,Lunchtime is fun,My son (4) picked this lunch bag out himself after looking at about 20 Dino lunch pails online knowing we probably wouldn't find anything but Disney lunch pails in the department stores. It was shipped VERY fast and my son loves it and is so proud to carry it himself. He is practicing saying all the dinosaur names pictured.
2,This book is not for the average investor,"This book is way too technical with Caculus formlulas that are prepared by doctorates in the field, and is a waste of money and time forMr John Q. Public. I am really disappoited"
4,Old world charm and Cary Grant equals good film.,"I had never seen this film before I happened upon it on Netflix. I love Cary Grant and enjoyed the younger Shirley Temple films when I was younger and so gave it a view.This movie featured a Cary Grant in his hey day, as charming as handsome as ever. The story is about two sisters who live together, the eldest being a Judge and Shirley Temple's character, being an 17 year old high school student who falls in love with Mr. Nugent (Grant's character). After finding himself in the Judges court already, he has to date Shirley Temple's character until she tires of him.Quaint, fun and enjoyable. I would recommend this film!"
5,The Bachelor and The Bobby-Soxer,Great movie and very interesting and will hold your attention from start to finish. One of shirley Temples greatest movies. They just can't make em this good anywhere anymore unfortunately. She is so humorous and so darn cute. Wonderful movie.
3,Thank You Dev!,"My father was swept up in Los Angeles just after Pearl & prior to the declaration. The FBI also visited my mother's home. My 'Pop' spent time in various camps in America but managed to rejoin my mother and eventually secure US citizenship... but we grew up knowing that it was an uncommenly known fact that it was not only the Japanese who were denied liberty and rights. I am grateful that my family was spared the impact of repatriation which Mr. Jacobs' family experienced. I am thankful that I have had a chance to read this book and felt the personal tragedy, as well as the example of the dangereous machinery involved when an system staffed by 'order followers' keeps following orders... even to tormenting a 13 year old child's world. It was not expected by the Germans and Japanese - who's families' cultural connections today may mark them for FBI scrutiny and suspicion if another world crisis threatens in the future..."
1,Do not buy if you like hunting,"This is not a video for someone who actually enjoys hunting, the ""hunters"" in this film clearly have no talent. Most of the animals suffer through multiple poorly placed shots , this film is a disgrace to hunting and is exactly why hunting has a bad name. This is a disgusting waste of 50 minuets, not worth the money I paid for it."
5,"Great price, exactly what I needed","Bright, well made and way cheaper than what you'll find it for in the stores. Highly recommended. I'm using this as an anchor buoy.. I can see it from far away and it's lasted a few seasons so far."
4,Tastes Great,These cookies taste great. I couldn't find any GF sugar cookies at home so I ordered these. My kids loved them and couldn't tell the difference.
4,Dremel Brush 428,"This is a really handy brush, I have been trying to polish some stones for a while and this does the trick."
5,Rhineman Exchange,"'ve read this book some 20 years ago, if my memory serves me right. I looked for this book and bought it since I would like to read it again!!!Good reading........suggest book lovers to read."
5,An eye for detail,"One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the ""X"" model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the ""steel"" plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the ""X"" model and purchased the ""RS"" model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now."
2,You child may like it but it really isn't for younger kids,"My 3 year old picked this at the video store the other day and love it. However, I was not as pleased. There is cursing, sexual suggestions (mild but still there), and characters do die. Fortunately he did not catch the swearing (we don't curse around him) and he's too young to understand anything sexual. But he is at an age when questions about death arise and this did not help. If you do choose to let your younger viewer watch this then definitely use caution but I wouldn't recommend it.From my adult eye, I also have to say I'm not a big fan of that style of animation. It kind of feels like watching a video game. And the voice of Spiderman just didn't fit somehow."
2,Not for kids,"I bought this movie set for my nephew and have to say that I was unpleasantly suprised to hear the language used in this ""Cartoon"". Fine if your child is 13 and you don't mind, but NOT for little ones."
1,"Godawful, Hellbound Filth",The animation is horrible ... the voices are terrible ... and it was on MTV. Three strikes and YOU'RE OUT!The early 90s series that aired on Fox was far superior in every conceivable way. Too bad that series (along with the same era X-Men) may never been released on DVD in its entirety.
3,Doogie Howser + Spider Man + MTV,"Meh. I dug the graphics, but the new villains that were made up for MTV were so-so.Cool visuals, not too much substance, definitely an MTV production."
3,not really for kids,"The series is entertaining for adults, however, you may not want to buythis for kids. I bought it for my 9 yr old son. The story lines and animationare good... but... lots of sexual innuendo. And some curse words. Why thecursing is in there is beyond me. must be an MTV thing. but it ruinsthe show for broad viewing. The sexual implications are also unnecessary but added in to entice hormone-overdosed kids."
4,"It's a Grind, but It Does the Job","I use these with a hand jig attached to my dremel tool for sharpening the teeth on my 16"" chain saw. The stone material is good for about 7 or 8 uses, depending on how aggressive I am in sharpening. I find these to work much better than the diamond studded shafts which lose their effectiveness (diamond dust comes off) after one or two uses."
5,"One of the best, least-known accessories","This wheel is fantastic!it will remove material, *and* polish metal without a lot of heat; to an almost-mirror finish.Perfect for finish-work on metal!"
5,Bowrench,This tool does what it claims. I have installed pine decking on several decks having to use two people in order to straighten the boards. I purchased the Bowrench to install IPE decking and we were able to screw it down with one person using this handy tool. It will pay for itself the 1st deck you install
4,"A great tool, but not up to the task","I bought this tool before doing a very large deck covered with 5/4 Pau Lope. It is a great improvement over the Stanley Board Bender, because it locks in place, reducing our manpower needed. The problem stems from the soft metal that makes up the BoWrench. The pin began to bend after a few days, and the hole the pin went through got larger and larger. We also bought the adapter for double joists. That was a great success, except that the pieces that lock the head in place eventually started to slip. We reversed them and they worked a while more. Then we removed them and filed them down, so they had sharp edges again. Summary: a good tool which, with some modifications at the production level, could make it a life long tool."
5,Third Hand,Cepco Bowrench is the BEST thing since PEANUT BUTTER was founded. I should had purchase one 2 years ago instead of using the bar and muscle method.
5,BoWrench Decking Tool: excellent product,"This special purpose tool saved me lots of time, effort, and aggravation when I resurfaced my 700 sq ft deck recently. I highly recommend it."
5,CEPCO,I used CEPCO to put IPE decking boards on an approximately 400 sq.ft of deck. It was a life saver. I had quite a few boards with lateral warping that would have been otherwise impossible to straighten and used if I didn't have this smart tool. It was well worth the money.
5,Does what it is supposed to do!!,"I had a very large three tier composite deck my crew was working on and were struggling to get it done. After I used the Bo-Wrench and it worked so good, I immediately paid the over night fees to get an additional tool. This is a must have tool for composite decking using hidden fasteners. GREAT TOOL."
5,Can't built a deck without one!,"There are varying ""rules"" on putting down decking boards, however I beieve that when using PT, you need to get the boards as tight together as possible. The Bo-Wrench does just that. Once the board dries and shrinks, you'll have a smaller gap than if putting them down via some other method.Truly a handy tool, especially for when the baord are slightly warped. Well worth the money, even if only using it for one deck!"
5,Decking made easy,The BoWrench made laying 12 foot 2x6 as easy as pie. I replaced my 23 year old 2x6 deck floor. It was so much easier to straighten out the curves and keep the boards nice and tight. Highly recommend this tool and the product came just when they said it would.
4,American Standard Laundry Tub Faucet,This is a nice well made faucet. With its lever handles & washerless design it will function well in anyone's laundry room
3,funusual.,"Just a little over 12 months, or the length of a warrenty the unit deprogrammed itself from receiving anything but off air channels. After reading other reviews of audiovox drop down TV's I believe this to be a common problem. Cable is now useless on this tv. It has been well cared for and there was no other reason for the change to 2-13. I purchased the product 11-2003 through another online service. At over 600$ I'm more than a little let down. The fun ended when the tuner went south with the warrenty."
5,Must Read on Planned Parenthood & Eugenics,This is an excellent book on the history of Eugenics and the background of Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood. I would expect that most people will be surprised at the racism behind the Eugenics movement and the fruit that it has produced today.
4,"Great picture and sound, limited digital connections","If you are looking for a great picture with the ability to connect with your sound system with good results, this is the a terrific set. The picture is as good or better than any I have seen at much higher prices. The only drawbacks I have found are there is only one S-video connection, and the lack of digital audio out connections (I had to direct wire my DVD and VCR to my receiver which makes for a cumbersome playback). Those minor inconveinces were well worth it considering the pictue quality and the low price. I give 5 stars (*****) to the video performance and deducted one for the limitations outlined above...."
4,Great Saw for All Tpes of Work,I have had this saw for several years and have used for both fine cabinetwork and for cutting 2x4s. It is amazing how fast and how fine it cuts. I prefer it rather than my regular handsaws for almost all work. The only problem I have had is that the handle is getting loose so I would not recommend getting the extra blade. I do need a new blade because it does not seem to cut nails very well.
1,Well,"First of all the people saying ozzy is greedy and insulting him for putting out countless compilation albums have not paid much attention to recent Ozzy interviews. The reason ozzy did the cover songs for the box set to begin with was because he was sick of his fans being ripped off, you see Ozzy knows he has too many but the record label was gonna put out the box set either way. Ozzy decieded to put out some cover songs as something extra for the fans.He didn't have the time to put the effort into make a new studio album so what he did was recorded some stuff while he was on the road at Ozzfest 2004. That might actualy be the downfall of this record actualy, Ozzy didn't have the proper time to do it right and after getting off stage every night was probably realy tired, it might come across as Ozzy not putting enough effort into the songs.Now that this is done Ozzy should take a little break and then get back to doing what he does best, making some new orifinal music."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!,"I only listened to the previews of this album and DON'T BUY IT!!!!!! He picked the wrong songs to cover. Sunshine of Your Love (Cream), Sympathy for the Devil (The Rolling Stones), Mississippi Queen (Mountain). Those are classic rock songs, and they don't fit Ozzy's style. It sounds terrible. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this."
4,Enjoyable Read,"I love almost all of Sabrina Jeffries' books. This series has been a little less enjoyable for me than her others but still entertaining. I definitely liked Helena's story better than Rosalind's(I found Rosalind to be a total goofball and struggled to get through that book). Initially, I thought it would be the same with Helena's story, but Helena grows to know herself and her strengths as well as her weaknesses as the story progresses which makes the story quite good. I know Daniel was not a ""gentleman"" born, but there is a difference between hardened and crude. I thought maybe sometimes the character was a little more crude than he would have been in Helena's presence. He was intelligent, although uneducated - but some things he did and said seemed to blur those lines when it shouldn't have. Enjoyable read, nontheless."
5,handy Dremel tool,This little device has saved us lots of money and time. We can sharpen our chainsaw chains at home and get right back to work.
5,Zappa the songwriter,"Zappa is the ONLY one I can think of that makes a song in a crazy rythm like 11/4 + 7/8 or something sound like natural and relaxed! Unlike many stinking prog-rock bands that obviusly TRYING to be too complicated just for the sake. Or they fail to imitate Zappa..ok I stop kicking. What about the record?Theres not a bad track to be found here. The production is ultra-dense! I agree this music is a bit ""ugly"" but at the same time its so fun and keeps your attention. Lot of memorable tunes that will make you go humming for days! Ok, the last track (I dont wanna get drafted) really sucks but it doesnt matter, I cant give this less than five grand!"
2,"Oh Frank, what happened?","Do yourself a favour: if you haven't heardWe're Only in It for the Money, beg, borrow or buy a copy straight away. On that album, Frank Zappa produced a brilliant suite of tight, bitter little songs and experimental segues that systematically dissected the late 1960s. Such was the strength of that album that it remains relevant and compelling even today.'You Are What You Is' tries to do the same for the late 1970s and fails pathetically. Wit, experimentation and genuine artistry have been replaced by nasty smut, college-freshman level social comment and empty virtuosity. This is a messy, mean-spirited failure from a once great artist.GrabWe're Only in It for the Money- preferably withLumpy GravyandUncle Meatas well - instead: that remains a great trilogy and a crucial piece of work."
3,Instruction/Install issue(s).,"Once installed, this ladder was great on an '89 Fleetwood Jamboree. However, the install instructions were a bit confusing and lacking in thoroughness. I had to use the existing top base where it mounts in to the roof to make this ""universal"" ladder work. If I didn't have a little ""insight"" to the lacking instructions, I don't know if this ladder would have worked."
4,"Flyers, always cool","I'm not quite sure how the publisher afforded to print massive hardcover editions of what is essentially a collection of flyers, but i am thankful he did. I love flyers-- they are little pieces of history and art. The layout was unnecessarily jumbled and weird for no reasons many times. Plus the quotes from some punk/hardcore luminaries was uninspiring a best. But who cares ... the book is cool."
4,"Looks good, easy to install and update","I thought the bar bearing the weight would be made of metal, but it's only painted wood. It's actually composed of two wooden rails held together at both ends. The metal hooks onto which one hangs the pots are dropped into the space between the rails, relying on gravity to keep it stable. This way, I can slide the hooks to any position on the rail and add additional hooks as I get more pots. The hooks can also be rotated while in the rails so you can position the pots to face out, or to 'nest' together.The chains that come with the rack are ugly, but they're very easily substituted."
4,"Old, reliable","The reviewer with the two ""defective"" units should've replaced the S-Video cable.I had good use with mine. eventually replaced it with a JVC 7500, and later a panny AG-1980."
4,EXCELLENT SOUNDTRACK,"The movie CARRIE is truly one of the best psychologically terrifying movies in recent history; part of its ""get under your skin"" power lies in Pino Donaggio's eccentric and transporting soundtrack. While it is not the kind of music you play for a candlelit dinner, if you want to evoke memories of the haunting film, this will more than do the trick. Mother At The Top Of The Stairs is perhaps the most artistically gratifying piece for me, with its perfect blend of suspense and unbearably sad chords repeated over and over. It captures, without fail, the specific moods and feelings of the characters and story brilliantly. There are pieces missing however -- as in the playful piece that underscores the girls' punishment-workout, and the guys' tuxedo shopping."
3,hardened steel alloy nail puller,"Shark CORP 21-2028 Hardened Steel Alloy Nail PullersI like using this because it is light and compact. It works well with pulling nails. Works best with small jobs of pulling nails. For any other nail pulling jobs, I would recommend a nail bar.Estwing PB-18 18-Inch Pry Bar"
1,The main idea was good but everything else was really bad.,She repeated the same ideas over & over. She was aslo a very big name dropped. I think the book could have made all the same ideas in about 50 pages. I believe that she was just so happy that she was writing a book & really did not care if it was good or not. I would not buy this book if I was you just read the first couple of pages.
5,This is an extremely important book,"This is an extremely important book -- it should be read widely. Ms Marx Hubbard is an imaginative thinker, with useful and interesting ideas about the future, and a clear and accessible writing style. She believes that the problems humans are experiencing, worldwide, are part of a birth process: we may head toward either a catastropic end (in violence and dwindling resources) or a better future (in peace and sharing) and we now have the ability to choose which it will be. There's a very valuable appendix, listing organizations, educational institutions and media outlets that concentrate on successful, innovative projects. I have never met Ms Marx Hubbard, but, as a publisher, I would have been proud to publish this book."
3,"Too small, too expensive","I've always used homemade versions of the tweaker out of wood and thought it was time to try the real thing. It works ok, but the handle is too short to lever the worst 2x6's around without getting some unneeded arm exercise. If it was maybe 6-8 inches longer and a little lighter and still sold for the 30 some bucks, then I would be impressed."
5,great third arm,"Works pretty well for holding things straight, leveraged by one knee so I can get a few nails in place. When you work alone you occasionally need a third arm."
3,works ok,it worked ok. the short part of the claw i think was too short. you really don't get the good enough hold on the plank that needs to be straigthen.on my project for building my deck i was not very happy with the Tweaker.
1,Product not as advertised,"Let me first say that I have bought WOW toys in the past and I have always been happy with the quality. While the quality of this toy is good, it does not come with all the pieces/ men as advertised. The fire engine I received had one guy and one emergency barrier. This item is described as having two guys and two emergency barriers. The pictures all show these pieces as well, but my set only contains one of each. My boys LOVE the guys, so I specifically ordered this item because the of the number of guys that were supposed to be included. Very disappointed in Amazon for switching it with another set."
1,IS ANY ORIGINALITY ANYMORE ??,"SOMEONE I WORK WITH TOLD ME ABOUT THIS NEW BAND.SO, I WENT OUT TO FIND A COPY.I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY HAD THIS UNDER THE TECHNO/ DANCE SECTION AT BEST BUY?? SO,I BOUGHT IT AND PUT IN MY CD CAR STEREO.I GAVE IT LISTEN, AND THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL ?? IT SOUNDS LIKE MOST OF THESE SEMI-NEW GRUNGE BANDS.DAMN,IS THERE ANYMORE ORIGINALITY IN ROCK N ROLL ???I HOPE SO !!!! BUT, I HATE TO SAY THIS,BUT THIS GROUP HAS NO FUTURE. ITS POOR GARBAGE GRUNGE."
4,Strong Debut!,"This is just the beginning of Aphasia's rise to the top. ""Fact & Fiction is a strong and energetic debut album. ""House of Cards"", ""We All,"" and ""Push for New,"" are the best tracks, along with the stuck-in-your-head-for-days single ""Flatline"". It's definitely an album you can play all the way through without getting bored or skipping a track. Powerful vocals and catchy choruses! This is a great buy!"
4,Limited usefullness,The product is constructed very well & it performs perfectly. The only disappointment is that I found it of limited usefullness when doing macro photography. It helps making fine adjustments to where you want the object in your shot but focusing is no more helpfull than when you manually focus using the lens.
5,Eureka Tent,"Just a great tent. Very easy to assemble on my own and even faster with two. The fly makes it nearly bullet proof in the wind and rain and is also a snap to install.Space is always an issue with a ""hex"" tent so do not be fooled by the six person rating. This tent is best served with two adults and perhaps one child."
2,NOT worth the MONEY,"My husband and I had a wedding to attend. I happen to be blessed and married to a very important man, and of course alot of eyes are on me.I wanted to look as good as I possibly could, so drove down to Nordstrom and purchased this in nude.I would have to say that overall, it did do some control, however not what it claimed. The top also continously kept rolling down (which defeats the purpose of these and makes you get a big bulge by your bra){BIG DOWN FALL FOR ME}I don't believe I will wear these much. Hard to put on.One good thing I will say, you can't see the seem by your legs and it lifts up your buttocks ok.Again, for the price I would have to tell you to save your money!"
2,TINY snails,"My Blue Tongue Skink loves snails. I have been feeding him a different brand of canned snails (that are large a juicy) and decided to branch out and try this. The snails in this can were so small....like the size of tiny pebbles. He wouldn't come near his food bowl. Maybe some reptiles will eat these, but since they are so small they dry up in the food dish within 30 minutes becoming totally inedible."
5,happy mom,Santa left this CD under my son's Christmas tree. He is 7 and is in awe of the Jonas Brothers being able to sing and play guitar. He was happy to get a CD of GUYS playing music and not just GIRLS. We have played this CD non-stop. I have found the songs catchy and easy to listen to even for adults. It's not too teenie-bopper. I find myself singing along in the car. My 5 yr. old daughter loves it too. It is nice to have music the whole family can enjoy.
5,Jonas Bros,"Ok, I admit it. Even though I have an eight year old son, I had no idea who these guys were before Thanksgiving until he mentioned them one day on the way home from school. Guess that means I haven't been paying too much attention to the shows he watches :-( Well, I read the review that compared them to Hanson and thought that since he seemed so enthralled with them, the CD would make a good stocking stuffer. I have to say that I was plesantly surprised when we listened to it for the first time. It has a certain listenability to it that works for both adults and kids and they definately are not one of those groups that parents hate and kids adore. Their music is upbeat without being syrupy sweet and the lyrics have positive messages. I highly recommend this CD."
5,AWESOME CD,this is the best cd ever!!!! not only are the songs incredible and the boys are soooo cute but its on this unbelieveable cdvu+ format which has a bunch of bonus material like photos and videos. i recommend this cd to anyone that likes pop/rock music. once u hear this u will get hooked on the awesome jonas brothers!!!!!!!!
2,"Okay, but just not the best...","The Jonas Brothers are a good band of singers, but this album just didn't entice me. The only song I liked was ""The Year 3000"". It's so hard to hear them though, because the music is just too rowdy. But these boys sure beat Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus!"
4,Jo Bros Make Fun and Upbeat Music,"I have recently become a fan of this band. This album is a step up from their debut ""It's About Time,"" with funkier, more complex songs. Hit songs ""SOS,"" and ""When you Look me in the Eyes,"" drive the album, while tracks such as ""Goodnight and Goodbye,"" and ""Hello Beautiful,"" trace te bands evolution from rock to soul. There is something for everyone on this album. The reason for four stars is that compared to their new album ""A Little Bit Longer,"" ""Jonas Brothers,"" falls short of the emotion portrayed in songs such as ""A Little Bit Longer,"" ""Sorry,"" and ""Can't Have you."" However, this album is better than most of their peers including Miley Cyrus. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,Jazz-discharge pleasure,"Yes, the 3 instrumentals on this album are pretty damn good, but this is the album which contains the story of the Jazz Discharge Party Hats done in Zappa's famous ""meltdown"" lyrical style. What can I say-it's some good old-fashioned, offensive, Zappa-style humor!"
3,The Man From Utopia,The CD version of this album is totally remixed and remastered from the vinyl version. The tracks are even in different order than the origional version. Like many of Zappa's CD's the vinyl version is much MUCH better sounding. Whoever did this to Zappa's catalog did his music and his fans an injustice. I've read he may have done that himself in the early 90's!
1,Zappa's NADIR,"Obviously, Zappa wasn't just a genius. Man, could he be a real jerk sometimes. For me, this is unquestionably his worst album ever. The songs sound like something he could come up with in his sleep. Even the instrumentals are boring. The production and sound quality (normally top notch on a Zappa album) isn't up to his standards at all. The only thing Zappa is telling me here, is how sick and tired he really was of making ""rock"" albums at this point of his career. Believe me, together with ""Drowning Witch"", ""Francesco Zappa"" and ""Thing Fish"" this is an album to avoid unless you are a serious copletist of FZ."
4,A good product...I think,"I just used this on my most recent cold sore (darn you chocolate!). I used this in conjuction with cleaning my cold sore with hydrogen peroxide as well as taking l-lysine tablets so I am not sure if this product alone would signficantly cut down the life of a cold sore but I know it DOES help with the pain/tingling/itchyness. Also, it goes on pretty clear (a little shiny) which is better than some other ointments I've tried.In the end my cold sore reared it's ugly head late Friday/ early Saturday but was scabbed over by Monday morning. Would use this product again."
5,Help is finally here,"I get cold sore once a year probably the strong persistent ones..on eon top of another might be my s,ow healing but they just pile on and manifest from there on this recent one last about two weeks until I got I went to heLth stor efor help... I used it casually twice in total in two days it subsides and healed.. I then use aloe to speed up the black nasty mark for wound and mark treatment ... For me this gel stick is god send even though didn't buy from this vendor but the product is solid cold sore treatment... I m almost looking forward for another onset probably next year to have this combat again! Cold sore ! I m not back down"
2,Not what I expected,"Most of this book is manual node entry (""old school PSpice""). Although the author fully explains the reasoning,I was looking for instructions on Capture and Schematic, which are more useful to me. Only 4 out of 17 chapters discuss Capture. Nothing specific on Model editor."
4,"A tad stout, but still good if you like the smell of lavender.","I have the Taylor Sandlewood and Rose, and like both of them very well. I thought I'd experiment a little and go with the lavender. If you like a good stout lavender smell, then you'll definitely like this. It is a little strong if you open up the jar and stick your nose in it. Upon first opening, I was worried it would be TOO strong. Just like all the others though, it's not as pungent after you shave and rinse as it is if you smell it out of the jar.Bottom line: if you like the smell of lavender, then get this. If you like the ""barber shop"" smell, get the sandlewood. If you like a softer & gentler, but still flowery smell, get the rose."
4,Awesome,"Well I, like most DLP buyers, bought one for size/price value. This TV is a perfect balance of low cost and huge screen. Excellent picture quality all around, broadcast tv looked terrible at first but after a couple days it started picking up digital channels via the built-in tuner. Looks great as my computer monitor, PS3 looks nice as well on hdmi. My only complaint so far is that the hd tuner in my tv seems to get weak signals on a couple channels. It's frustrating tryin to watch NBA playoffs in hi def when the tv keeps glitching out."
5,Great for the price I paid!,"Bought this off Amazon for $1549 + free white glove shipping, and I haven't regretted it for a second. Running it as a computer monitor too (1920x1080 @ 60hz), plays Divx encoded Planet Earth HD DVD rips great, plays downloaded 1080p trailers great (Fantastic 4, Oceans 13, etc). Wish it had a 3rd HDMI slot (DVI/HDMI1 for computer, HDMI2 has DVD, would like a 3rd for DirecTV HD reciever. Currently leave DirecTV in and swap HDMI for DVD player when I want to watch a movie.On a side note, I ran a side-to-side comparison of a cheap BestBuy DVD player outputting a raw 480i signal via HDMI and allowing the TV to upconvert, and compared it to the Samsung 1080p upconverting DVD player hooked up via HDMI, and I could see little to no difference. Their upconversion does a pretty damn good job, I don't think you'll see ANY advantage to getting a 1080p upconverting dvd player over just giving it a straight 480i signal and letting the TV do the conversion."
1,Lousy TV,I've had this TV for 2.5 years and had to spend over $665 in repairs. I bought the TV in July of 2007 and in April 2009 had to the power supply ($265) and in January the LED driver board needed to be replaced ($396). Buyer beware.
4,Quality TV at great price,"have been using this TV for about 3 months now....Overall is excellent Tv with great colors, easy to hook up and great features (PIP in particular). Only issue is that the blacks are not as pure as expected. Have read in other reviews that by fiddling with the settings you can adjust this, but just haven't had the time yet.All being said though, I couldn't find another TV with the size and features at the same price!!!!"
4,Great Buy,"The TV is great. I'm still trying to get the best color settings figured out, but that's to be expected.The only complaint is the verticle light shift that is noticed when you are either above or below the center of the TV. You can definately notice a decrease in brightness. That makes the height placement of the TV tough, ie. if you play a Wii standing up vs. sitting on a couch for a movie.Overall I'm very pleased. No snags or hitches anywhere."
3,Confessions of an American Girl,I belived it was gonna be a good movie but was not what i was expecting and glad to say it was not scratched or damaged. Fast delivery and the case was great condition.
4,Great price,"I used these batteries in RED dot scopes and they work great for the first few weeks of use, but only last about a month."
4,Like it.,Its very affordable and I probably be buying and using these from now on.It does last as the original AG5 I used.
5,thank you,we are enjoying the stories and the quality of the books is more than excellentthank you it will last a long time
3,We are not dumb!,"They are good books except for Carnivorous Carnival, but he author makes it so predictable! He says like ""the Quagmires were wrong"", instead of making it intense. And he defines every stupid word! And whats with Beatrice? So off subject! Make an autobiography if you want to mention Beatrice, Snicket!!"
5,The rising tide lifts ALL the boats...,"I was brought to this book by what some call coincidence and have found in its pages ideas, images and thoughts that resonate within me as undeniably true (and why would I want to deny them!?)Ms. Fareed has captured and made thoroughly accessible spiritual ideas that work in rough going. Valuable. Powerful. Inspiriational!"
5,use with my pet nail grinder,"Not much to say about Dremel attachments, other than that Dremel is a great brand and these products live up to that reputation. I use these in combination with my Dremel pet nail grinder and they effectively and safely trim my pets' nails."
5,Thanks,"I haven't used it yet, but between the three Springer Spaniel's in my life, it will come in handy. My niece know's how to use it. She learned how to use it at her volunteer job."
3,"Wow, it's loud!","Had to chime in here about the bus, because my family also owns Fireball Frankie (guy in a race car) from Wow Toys. We LOVE Fireball Frankie. He's been going strong for years. The friction motor is indestructible, and our boys, currently 4 and 2, really get a kick out of Frankie making a quick exit when the car runs into things. Wow Toys get two enthusiastic thumbs up from us. But this bus--I've got to say, it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. It's far and away louder than Fireball Frankie. We're not a quiet family, but my husband and I can't stand the incredibly loud sound from this bus. We can't get rid of it because the youngest loves it, but we find it spends more time ""hidden"" than we'd like..."
4,A great addition to a FZ/M Collection,"I'm not sure if the title of this CD is well thought out: who out there has ever touched this group to this day, for rock-jazz-classical expositions? Sometimes doo-wop is mixed in - never out of place.I bought this CD primarily to hear the original long versions of ""The Orange County Lumber Truck"" and ""Oh No"". Still love the ""Weasels..."" pressing of said compositions, but now 11:12 of a time-capsule nominee!The usual tasteful trappings through the Zappa family Trust."
3,Over Easy - Creative Ideas for Pieced Quilt Backs,"This definitely broadens horizons for making interesting and attractive quilt backs. When I look at the plain muslin or printed fabric backs of quilts I made years ago I wish I'd had it then. The variation in themes and techniques shown provide lots of choice and spark the imagination. Maurene White, Mntreal, Quebec, Canada"
3,Over Easy - and quite simple,A good book for beginning or novice quilters. I didn't get much new information from it but thought there were a few good suggestions
5,For pulling all types of nails,"From 6 to 16 penny. I kept seeing this product used by our subcontractor when he did some major remodeling a year ago. I picked one up to pull a bunch of old shelves down in our garage. The previous owner must have just bought a pneumatic nail gun and was trying it out, judging by how many nails he used to attach the shelving to the walls! This tool had NO PROBLEM removing the nails!!Anyway, the Shark CORP 21-2030 Chrome-Vanadium Nail Puller is 11 3/4 inches long so there's lot's of leverage, with a uniquely shaped ""cat's paw"" claw at either end. This design easily slides under the head of sunk in nails or onto the shank of headless ones."
5,"""Lather"" delevers and amazes as THE Zappa compilation","Product was new, and in excellent condition, as advertised. Wonderful price, good communication, and it shipped my way very quickly. This box set is, in my opinion, the definitive Frank Zappa compilation. An amazing songlist, fantastic sound, right at my favorite juncture of Zappa's long and amazing career. So many Zappa fans, new and old, often ask--which disc should I buy next? Well, ""Lather"" is a must for a novice listener, along with a seasoned fan. I came here, to Amazon, for wonderful selection and a great used price. This disc is somewhat rare and retails for nearly $75 when it is rarely seen in a store. I paid nearly half that amount, and now I have the rest of my life to listen and enjoy this amazing musical accomplishment, by my salient musical idol."
5,The Great Lost Zappa Album,"Lather is one of Zappa's most ambitious creations, covering multiple continents of musical territory. There's tightly played hard rock, dopey little ditties, soaring guitar solos, moody orchestral pieces--and all segue into a single roller-coaster ride for the ears. I was lucky enough to have picked up test pressings of the original unreleased LPs of Lather years ago, and I'm happy to say that these CDs, lovingly remastered at Frank's own studio after his death, live up to the promise of Zappa's vision for this work. Plus there are several outtakes, including a lengthy and energetic guitar solo, ""Lather Goods,"" excerpted within the album but also included in its original form.This is absolutely essential stuff for any hardcore Zappa fan, but also a good introduction to the variety of Frank's work for those not familiar with the enormous FZ canon."
3,great if you're into rustic,"This book isn't quite what I expected. I don't usually think of homes on the water limited to areas of New England, Northern California and the NW coast. The homes are primarily of wood construction and all very rustic. I was hoping for examples also of architecture on the Florida coast - stucco construction, more Mediterranean in style. There was none of that. Most homes are set in a forest on a lake or ocean."
3,Droopy Jesus,"Looks very nice out of the box. Head bobbles a bit more than I anticipated (very long and spindly spring). The material doesn't tolerate summer dashboard heat very well, resulting in my Jesus becoming very droopy. But he still looks happy."
5,Funny!,"The perfect buddy to keep on your desk, or bring on a car during a road trip! Shake the head..makes you laugh!"
2,1 Problem,"The one problem with this tool is that when you squeeze the citrus, the enamel on the top half of the squeezer picks up a sticky film from the citrus rind that won't easily come off. You can't just put it in the dishwasher, you have to actually scrub hard to get it off. I believe a differt brand of squeezer without OXO's type of enamel would work better."
2,Juice squirts out the sides,"I bought one of these to replace a standard Mexican aluminum squeezer that I broke when trying to squeeze an old, hard lime. This product definitely had more attention paid to design and materials, and is probably stronger, but, juice squirts out the side - not a good thing."
1,Buy another squeezer,"When compared to other, less expensive squeezers (of the same type as the Progressive Metal Lime Squeezer), this squeezer just doesn't stand up. The simpler models do a better job squeezing the juice, are less prone to annoying (and sometimes painful!) squirts in the eye, and seem tougher than the OXO model.Caveat: if you buy one of the simple squeezers, try to get one without the latex paint. It'll just come off anyway, probably in pieces."
2,NOT SO GOOD,"I have another brand of squeezer, less design and more cheap, that does the final job better....squeezes better the lemon/citrus than the OXO Good Grips Citrus Squeezer. I suggest to try other brands. I am disappointed."
1,OXO Good Grips 1057962 Citrus Squeezer,I was very disappointed in this product. It just didn't work as well as squeezing by hand. DO NOT PURCHASE. This is a total waste of money.
3,"Nice Idea - Not quite 16""","Bought this because I thought it would help me build walls for an addition quicker and with evenly spaced studs. On my first wall, I layed out the 16"" stud spacing (which you shouldn't really have to do with the Framemaster), then started using the FrameMaster - it was quick but wasn't quite on my 16"" marks - it was maybe 1/8"" off (too long). As you progress, you keep adding 1/8"". It doesn't take long to really get out of wack. I had to resort to hand setting the studs (yuck). I looked the tool over, and I think the molding isn't perfect. I'll carve down one of the legs to make it 16"". Too bad, mine wasn't right on 16"", I could see how this could help build a wall fast."
2,A totally different Finch...,"I'd like to start by saying What it is to Burn, in my opinion, is one of the greatest cd's in my collection. But in this cd they sound more emo, and frankly, i think it sucks."
3,Mmm.. what happened?,"First off I'm not actually a kid, I'm a person who doesn't feel like getting an account.Well.. They sort of disappeared off the scene after What It Is To Burn, as someone else said.. So I expected their sophomore album to be at least decent but.. no, I don't like it.If you liked What It Is To Burn.. you probably won't particularly like this. Songs on WIITB most like this would probably be Project Mayhem and maybe Grey Matter.It isn't horrible. Its definitely still Finch's signature sound. But it isn't like WHat It Is To Burn, which makes it somewhat of a failure in my eyes.2.5 stars.. Because the songs don't suck, they just aren't that good. This can't hold a candle to WIITB, but if you are a newcomer to Finch maybe you could start with this album. I can see why some people would like it.But ask a friend to borrow theirs or copy it, its not really worth your money."
4,and then I wake up...,"wow. I must say that I did not give this cd a fair chance. I am a diehard finch fan. The first cd was and still is one of my favorite cds in my entire collection and their Ep ""Falling into Place"" is by far my favorite. When I first bought this cd, I was severely dissapointed. I took the cd and put it back in the case and it has sat in my cd rack until today. For some reason I just felt like listening to it, and after playing ""Miro"" and then ""A Man Alone"", I must say my opinion has severely changed. This cd may be quite different, but all in all, it is a very good album. Everyone who blew up on Finch and has ""renounced"" them, give it another chance and you might be happy with what you find."
1,this album was the worse ive heard ever,"there first album was extremely good, as all of the songs had both exceptional guitar, rhythems, and melodies etc... tere new album pisses me off because there is no tune to any of the songs!! the beats/rhyhtems are stupid - impossible to mosh to, and the guitars play random power chords that dont fit the non-existant tune. its like every one of them is doing there own thing. the album is retarted. there first album was much infinatly better."
4,Great CD,"Say Hello to Sunshine is a great album. The musical talent of the band has definately grown since WIITB. The music is not the same at all. The person below me said that there is crappy lyrics. Did I read that right? You can't tell me you thought the lyrics from WIITB better than this. The lyrics in this album are very smart. Here are some of the lyrics for the singles of both albums.Campare the two:WIITB 'Letters to you': ""Cant you see that I want to be there with open arms........I want you to know that, I miss you, I miss you so.""SHTS 'Bitemarks and Bloodstains': ""Meier may we be this way forever?Tell me lover what will become of the otherBones, skin, nails and fleshOn a bed of lack of passion, a medievil consequenceThey worry you with all the talk of how your not their kind""Now, which lyrics seem more meaningful?Not trying to pick a fight, though.This album was well worth the money, and the wait of THREE years. They have definately grown as a band. But, I do miss their old drummer."
4,Almost...but not quite,"For some reason I decided to race to the mall during my lunch to buy this CD...even tho i had heard a few tracks, and had been sketchy about liking it. When I purchased the album, I already knew that things were going to be...not like Finch, the Finch we all loved a few years ago. I gave it a chance, and so far, only listenign to it for a breif period of time, it is...to my surprise, a lot better than what I was expecting...but a lot worse than the catchy loveable old styled Finch. My favourite song is number 13, and 3. I seem to notice that Geffen has had a few bands change their ""style"" such as Blink-182 and now Finch. although I do believe that a lot of the screamo bands sounds the same, Finch, on of the bands who started it, tried to change and be different...but it didnt work for them this time."
3,Average,"When I listened to ""What it is to burn"" I was amazed. There were great songs, and I loved it. Then I heard it on the TV show ""One Tree Hill"" being played at a basketball game. I was kind of bummed. The music on One Tree Hill is classified as Popular Emo.Then I listened to ""Say hello to sunshine"" It's a good cd. I'm going to have to listen to it again, considering I've only listened to it once, but I can say that at this point, I liked What it is to burn better. However, there are great lyrics on this cd, and it seems a lot more mature than the debut.So yes, I like What it is to burn better, but this isn't a bad cd either. I think it will grow on me the more I listen to it."
4,"Heavy, Dark, only play at high volumes","Being a big fan of their first album I was very exicted for their new one. Is it different? yup....this one is darker, heavier and just plain crunchy in parts...love it, different is good, being the same every album is what leads to bad bands and bad albums.....enjoy it for what it is."
3,Good product with limited lifetime,"I purchased the Dremel 443 Carbon Steel brush to remove carbon ash deposits in the primer pockets of fired brass cartridge cases. There are many brushes available in this shape/size, but they're all too soft. Apparently so are carbon steel bristles, because it simply polished the burnt-on carbon deposits instead of removing them. Your mileage may vary."
5,Handy brush for ammo reloaders,"I purchased this brush for the explicit purpose of cleaning out the primer pocket of my brass casings. With this high quality brush, the Dremel is very good at this little task and makes case prep go faster. It is too early to tell if the price is fair, as that depends on the life of the brush."
3,sanding bands,It'a hard to write glowing words for sand paper and I feel a little lost for words. I have a hobby sculpting with Polymar clay and many times I have to sand the items when they ave finished baking in the oven. The Dremel sander works good.
3,Go bigger.,"Not recommended for big dogs. Too small for big foots toenails. I bought both sixes just in case, go with the bigger sander. I have a pitbull with pretty large nails though."
1,Dremel sent the wrong size bit!,"The replacement sand paper arrived a good week before the actual dremel. They enclosed a bit that doesn't fit into the base, so it's unusable. Of course, I was following the program of gradually acclimating my dogs to the presence of this little machine near their paws, so I didn't discover this for a while. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to make the dremel work and re-acquantaining my dogs with it, once the right piece arrives.I am very disappointed."
2,"Like most comedy albums, good for 1-3 listens only","I already have Billy The Mountain from JABF L.A., so this version is superfluous. The behind-the-scenes stuff is interesting once or twice, but like a comedy album, you don't come back to it (which is the problem with all Flo & Eddie era Zappa). The John stuff is cool (Zappa's solo on ""Well"" is killer), but by and large it's a different mix on some pretty awful cr*p. The new live stuff is the heart of the matter and there's not enough of it: a great Status Back Baby, Concentration Moon, and Cruisin' For Burgers. The 200 Motels material is for collectors only--if we bought the Ryko CD soundtrack, we know the story and the material here is not an effective counterpoint to the soundtrack booklet, nor does it add anything."
4,"Held up nicely, fine quality.","Have had these pillows for about 6 months and they are holding up! My wife and I love these and they have replaced some old flat pillows (that lasted just over a year -- we use them a lot!) on our couch, reviving the cases and aesthetics of our living room. The material on the exterior is not my favorite though -- I don't know what it is, but it tends to get hot when my face touches it (we bought a little big for our cases and part of it is exposed -- we need another button!) and isn't the most comfortable. It's my problem, but thought I'd mention it."
5,Favorite Things,I had one of these back in the 80's but one of my kids used the handle portion as a toy to bang on things. The stores don't carry these so I figured they were not available. Nice to be wrong.
5,De-Evolution In Audio,"Oh, those spudboys. They know how to piss off an audience. It's pefect for this to be in reverse chronological order, as we see the beginnings of chaos in Devo's famous 1977 performance at Max's Kansas City that sent 'em into the big time. Then we time warp to a show where Devo nearly gets into a fist fight after only a few songs. Poor spuds couldn't figure out what they were listening to!The last part of the album, however, is the beautiful part. 1974, Devo's first gig. As the audience cowers, Devo verbally rapes them with constant shouts of ""Are we not men?"" Diving into the wonderfully vulgar ""I Need A Chick"" they are only stopped when the power is cut. Turning up your volume high-as-it-will-go and you'll hear Mark, Gerry and some of the local spuds almost kill each other.Oh, yes, indeed. Devo Live: The Mongoloid years is well deserving of 5 stars, even with its tape hiss and 4 track sound. It's a testament to De-evolution.DUTY NOW FOR THE FUTURE!"
4,Nostalgia,"Peter Alexander sings the old songs in the nearly perfect Wienerisch - so well, in fact, that none but a native of Vienna would be likely to detect any flaw. Nevertheless, he sings them well enough to bring a tear to the eye of at least one Wienerin. None but the great masters (Hans Moser and Hermann Leopoldi) could do any better. This CD is simply wonderful!"
4,good overview but short on any deep details of global warming debate,"I enjoyed this book, being a good introduction to the science of climate, over seasons and over eons. He leads the reader to plausible conclusions by offering examples of how things have been, on the Earth and its neighboring planets, and the direction they are likely to head. I think all reasonable people today agree that increased greenhouse gases will cause SOME warming in the future. Question is how much? and how quickly? And that is where the science needs to be more exact, and where more insight is needed. This book does not do that adequately. It remains a good starting point, however, for those who can seek further details elsewhere, later."
5,push button handle,A good quality handle. It is reasonably priced. A must have item when you are finishing concrete. I would buy another one if ever needed
2,for chess nuts only,"Nabokov seems to have specialised in brilliant, obsessed characters, weaving them into complex situations that get more and more, well, convoluted. When the character is sympathetic or funny, his novels succeed. But when they are evil or too recondite in their pursuits, they fail, at least for me.While my chess pals love this one, I found it frightfully boring, certainly one of the worst of his novels. But then, that is really saying that it didn't work for me and is a matter of taste. I just didn't like the character and didn't care if the end is yet another chess-like trick. Indeed, the only reason I got through it was my own compulsion to try to read everything that that great novelist wrote.Get it if you like weird chess masters and want to enter the mind of a particularly sick and narrow one."
4,What it's Like to go Mad,"This is one of Nabokov's early works, but it's a very mature story--the prose is sparse, unnecessary detail is nonexistent and the story is maddeningly gripping. Nabokov follows (although not usually linearly) the young Russian chess prodigy, Luzhin, through his strange and obsessive rise to the top of the chess world, his marriage to a fascinating and caring woman, and his slow, maddeningly intricate and psychologically complex 'downfall' (though this isn't the right word). I recommend this book for at least three reasons: 1) It's short and gripping 2) Nabokov's prose is inspiring and 3) The story of poor Luzhin makes you feel as if you too are going mad (this is a good thing--you get to experience a plausible account of madness without--let's hope--going mad yourself). Enjoy!"
5,scentsy must have,If you have a scentsy plug in warmer/burner this is a MUST HAVE. You have a snowballs chance of finding these bulbs in your local grocers or hardware store. If it's not a 15W bulb it won't be hot enough to melt your wax - trust me. I have a collection of 4 & 7 watt bulbs that I bought before I figured out the problem. Save yourself time & hassle & just order a stack of these....
2,Decent batch of tunes marred by horrendous production,"Horrible boomy drum sound and too much guitar make this the least appealing of the Rank and File albums. It's too bad because there are some good songs (e.g. Golden Age, Black Book) here. Four stars for the songs, one star to the production."
4,Marlene Dietrich Die grossen Erfolge,Extremely happy to have received this disc which I had not heard for some 43 years since I was at college in England
2,not so great,"The last 3 or 4 songs are old, good recordings. The other songs were more recently recorded and it sounds like an old lady with a 2 pack-a-day habit of no-filter camels was singing. Yuck.So I ripped the last few songs and burnt them onto another CD."
5,Enjoyed immensely,"This one goes on the bookshelf over the desk. Thoughtful and compelling, with plenty of little surprises. Not a ""funny"" book, yet a wit and humor that made me reflect and laugh out loud."
2,Memories that should be in reserve,"If you can get through the first few pages of this book, it might be interesting. This book is really for linguists only; it's full of jargon that's incromprehensible and the voices of the Chilcotin informants never really comes through to the reader. Instead, we have to read about Dinwoodie's trevails which are about as insightful as network news."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie will never be cool.Get the my scene goes Hollywood and Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus insted.Bratz dolls are ugly.They are losers.They are terrible.P.S.This movie is boring,because I heard about the story and it realy stinks."
1,Don't waste your money on this movie - get the My Scene movie instead,"I've heard that the My Scene dolls are coming out with a new movie that's supposed to be much better than this ""Rock Angels"" movie (I heard it has cameos by Lindsay Lohan and Harvey Weinstein) - and supposedly it's supposed to be much higher quality and way more age-appropriate for girls. The word on the street with my circle of friends with daughters in the 8-12 age group is that it's definitely the more wholesome, age-appropriate movie choice this fall. After hearing that, and after seeing Bratz's incredibly disappointing excuse for a last movie with my daughter, I can tell you where I plan to spend my money - especially after seeing this (and my past disappointments with the quality of Bratz's products and their toys' inappopriateness)."
4,i am so sorry,"but this movie is NOTHING compared to genie magic.It is cool and all,good music and stuff,but not as funny.In case you are wondering the order of the Bratz on the cover,it is :(left to right)Roxxi=Cool huh?Sasha=Sweet outfitJade=She probrbly dyed her hair...Yasmin=ObviousCloe=Is it me or is her hair more bleached?"
1,TOO BAD,I hate Bratz and I hate thier clothes and thier look.They are veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery ugly and slutty.I Barbie the most.She came out first and she is the best.my scene is also great too.Dont get this DVD.BRATZ DOLLS SUCK!!!!!EWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!BOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
2,A bratz fan no more,"So the adults are right it is very innapropet tourds people my age (I'm ten)or around there. The other ""kids reviews"" burst out anger because they like the movie (because it is kinda funny)even though it isn't kid friendly at all or they just don't ""get"" how it is innapropet.Even though I find Bratz cool I'm going to stick to Winx club because Winx is apropet for children my age.~*~*~*~*~*~*~Sorry Bratz fans!*~*~*~*~*~*~"
1,COPY,"The cgi animation was copied from the barbie movies, the demo record was copied from the first my scene movie, they only wear black white and red, they have tatoos, they should be named rock devils, they look like bleeding skunks, they copied off of diva starzeverything copied was copied from matteleverything made up is bad"
1,Such a little thing...,"A tatoo is so tiny. Just a little detail that everyone can live without. But they have to have one. Red, black, and white are cool colors, but together, they make the Bratz look like smokers. I, too, agree that a lot of the new Bratz features were copied from Mattel. Too many features. Don't buy it. Buy the Mattel movies. All the kids(inluding mine), teens, and grown ups that I know like mattel products better. Buy those."
5,I hafta see this!!!!!!!!,"Does anyone know if Pheobe is in tthis movie???? At the end??? Please answer!!!!!!Jade starts working for a crummy magazine and gets fired. The Bratz start their ownmagazine. Then, a sscorchin' concert is going on in london, so they decide to get anarticle on it for their mag! They fly there, and discover that their passes have dissapeared! So they pretend to be a band to get in! Once they get there, they finda girl named Roxxi on next. Her band didn't show up so she went on with them!What happened next? Watch it!I haven't."
5,.........,Sarah... in my review i wasnt doin anything wrong. i jus said that they shouldnt be dissin Bratz. just like that person telling ppl to go to h311. we like wat we want. and i wasnt callin them no names either. im jus sick of people coming in here telling us off because we like Bratz. And yeaa... i remember ur old reviews. im glad u stopped the anti-Bratz thingLONG LIVE BRATZ~~~
1,Blagh! I think I'm gonna barf ON THIS MOVIE!,"This movie sucks! I really hate those klutsy twins who call the braz ""losers."" (What's so cool about those twins anaway, since their constantally bumping into each other's faces in the movie.)"
1,Bruin Bear is right,she is totally 100% right I don't know anyone really who likes bratz i know more people who like my scene they wear real colors these dolls only wear red black and white get the my scene movie
5,Gosh this movie looks awsome,I love Bratz dolls. I have over 50 of them. I want this movie more then anything in the world. Bratz rule and I agree with most of you. My Scene dolls do suck. I don't want their movie. Because they suck. I love Bratz dolls and I want this movie.
2,Disappointingly Small,I thought I was purchasing a book that would go into detail about how to get to the 10 Commandments - instead I received what seemed like a booklet. It would have better if Cardinal had elaborated on her points.
3,song request,does anyone know the song that is playing in the background at the magazine party scene
1,falling short,This tent was purchased for the beach only. Very difficut to setup and the materials for the tent are not very sturdy. I would not recommend this item for a single person or family. The wind pulls the stakes from the sand and you have to add secondary support to keep the tent in place.
4,Really?,"Why does your product info not contain the dimensions for the two available products? I had to search for them from another seller, so for the people who don't want the hassle. Here you go.4 oz.MD: 4'11'' H x 7'6'' W x 4'6'' L, Wt: 5 lbs. LG: 5'9'' H x 10' W x 6' L, Wt: 8 lbs."
4,solar tent or shelter,I purchased this for my fairskined grandaughter's 6th birthday. It was such a hit that she insisted that it be assembled immediately in the family room. She loves the colors and her parents like the easy assembly. Because it is so lightweight it's better to have 2 people put it up and take it down. The zippered windows and door provide for privacy or openness. Thinking of buying one for myself too.
5,Perfect for babies,Bought this tent for the beach for our 5 month old. He slept in it during nap time and it kept him cool and out of the sun.
1,Wrist and hand killer,I bought this hammer about a year ago because it looked different. It's different allright- it wrecks your wrist after about 4 nails are driven. Horrible balance and odd-shaped handle design combine to give the user carpal-tunnel syndrome instantly. Wrist surgeons will fall in love with users of this wanna-be hatchet-hammer. Spend the extra bucks on a titanium and you'll never be sorry.
1,Not For Pros - This is for girls,"I have been framing for 15 years. I paid 55 CDN for this hammer and the handle broke off at the head after 1 week. The dealer was a total jerk and said too bad we don't warrant the handle. The problem is that the 18"" handle provides too much leverage for the sharply tapered handle where it fits into the head. El snappo, no no more handle I bet they are out of business within the year."
3,Use only as a numbing oniment,"I use ambersol usually with another medication because it only numbs the pain but does not promote healing. I purchased zilactin B, which is an oral medication for cankuar sores. I used ambersol and zilactin B together, making it numb the sore intensely and healing it at the sametime. Oral medicines like zilactin B and cankuarX do work well enough on their own to numb the pain as well but I like to use ambersol just to have extra strength on numbing the pain. Overall this relieves my pain for an hour but it is not good enough for cankuar sores alone. I recommend just buying cancuar sore medicine and if the pain is still unbearable, purchase ambersol to use with the medicine."
3,"Sadly, fades from ""Wowza!"" to ""What-th--?"" in too little time.","I can't believe I'm giving the guys I got beat up for liking in junior high only three stars. Some tracks on this CD are forever good. The rest--well--even knowing every Devo song by heart (where can I find ""Find Out,"" BTW? Since parting with my records over the years the flipside of the dance-velocity 12"" LP of ""Peekaboo"" has been impossible to trace), I did doubletakes on some of the titles. The memories of hearing the tracks played before Devo concerts is a good one, but this is a take it or leave it type of thing."
5,Classic!,This debut album was vastly underrated by their record label and goes to show you that good music is determined by good listeners not label heads. Chapter 8 kind of flew under the radar even though they had very good music. This is a must have for any music lover's collection.
4,Simply Perfect,"Its perfect, what more can i say. I bought this hoping it would eliminate my need for a full body case or skin. It quickly and easily and cleanly adhered to my ipod and it didn't come off until i tried to readjust it one day. Since my first purchase, I've bought 3 more. I like the simply look of my black ipod and I like how slim it is, the protector made it better by thwarting all assaults and keeping my ipod clean and unscathed. My only complaint is how it catches dust if applied incorrectly"
4,An excellent book,"I'm only about half way through this book but already I have read some very poignant and moving stories. This book is a collection of short stories by a wide range of women about their personal struggles and life experiences. Some of the stories are extremely well written and all of the stories give a fascinating glimpse into the hearts, minds and lives of ordinary women. This book should be read by both men and women who wish to understand themselves and others better. It's a pleasure to read!"
2,Works for less than 5 min then dulls.,"Went through two of these bits. At first they do cut through the grout like a hot knife in butter, but after not even 5 minutes these things just stop cutting and simply stay in place and start to glow red hot if you try to move it. Way to costly to constantly be replacing these bits. Going to give the diamond wheel points a try instead (7134 and 7144) since they seem to be a bit stronger and cost less."
3,Overall a good collection of old songs,"If english is your first language and you don't know Zucchero's songs that well this is an excellent CD, Dune Mosse with Mile Davis is good never heard this version before, Muoio per te with Sting is nothing new since it was recorded a while back, Pippo with Tom Jones is quiet good, Cosi' celeste with Chabi is a neat song. Overall it's definately worth the $12Ciao"
5,Zu & Co !!! FANTASTICO !!!,Absolutely fantastico !!!He is truly one of the best world artists and can interpret any and all types of music. The proof see how many musicians LOVE to play with him !!
2,hummmmm...,"I have loved all of Claire McNab's other books but this one... well, lets just say, is a drag. I tried to get into it but couldn't. The writting is sophomoric at best. I have read a lot, and I trully mean a lot, of romances (lesbian and otherwise), but this one is not up to par with even some of the more amateurish ones I have come across. What a waste of story line and talent! Then again, someone's idea of a mediocre book is another's best seller..."
3,Too damn small,The Exhumer has some nice features but the claws aren't wide enough to grab 16 penny hand drives or gun nails.
3,"Good for Buffett Completists, But It's Very Short","It was nice that Rancho Deluxe was issued on CD earlier this year as it was last Buffett work to be issued on CD. However, don't let the eighteen or so tracks on the back cover fool you, most are short dialogue snippets from the movie Rancho Deluxe and most of the Buffett songs are only 2 minutes in length. The whole CD is about 25 minutes long, so if you want to complete your Buffett collection, get it. Otherwise get something that gives you your money's worth!"
5,Enamored,"Back cover reads:THE PAST HAD FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH HIMDiego Laremos had never forgotten the last night he'd spent with Melissa Sterling five years before. She'd fled their home after a bitter dispute, hoping to escape their unhappy marriage. He hadn't forgiven her for leaving, though he'd hated himself even more for driving her away. Seeing Melissa again had renewed his hope for a possible future together.Melissa had felt the same way, but she'd lied to Diego in the past. Now she had to prove to him that she was indeed his love--his enamorada--and that the truth could set them both free...to love again."
3,"review of carnacki, the ghost finder","for a price of 0.0 it was a good read with some interesting ideas. however, it is far below similar writing by other authors such as edgar allen poe or henry james. i kept feeling that the author was going through the motions of setting up various ghost stories."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Big Art reaction time.A leading and not exactly shy and retiring artiste decides that he would like to put on a show on the planet Yan.This joint is notable for the structures there that are being studied, and that our artiste protagonist is interested in.No-one thought to ask the locals, who up until now haven't minded the small presence on their planet."
5,Touching story,This short Christmas story is one of Kingsbury's better books. I recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas and Kingsbury.
4,Positive and concise....,"What a concept...A documentary that suggests the president has transformed his life and found personal faith.If you believe this usual rabble the president must be lying - though they are quick to defend the master of untruths 'that depends on what your definition of is is'.The DVD offers an overview of the president and the importance he places on religion in the white house, such as the use of prayer.I found it an easy yet concise documentary."
5,A good acquisition,"I am very happy that I acquired this DVD. I haven't seen yet, but I think it would be a very beautiful movie."
2,Flimsy,Thought I was matching an old set. Almost--very similar design but much less quality. Flimsy and cheap feeling. Kept them anyway for backup use.
5,perfect,"It is just what I was looking for for my wife's bike. She needed a higher stem for better ride position, and better grasp of the shift levers. This stem gave us the height without pushing the handlebar away from her, aggravating the shifter problem. It is also high quality. I was very impressed with the selection of stems available from Amazon - better than the pure bike store sites."
4,GOOD DIKES,"these irwin cutters are good , not the best i've used not the worst. for the money they do the job."
1,not like a woman's watch,"It's way too big for a woman. It looks exactly the same size as that of a man's watch (I bought 2, 1 women's, 1 men's). So I had to return it. And they charged me -$20.98 for Promotional funds. Don't know why is that??? Anyway, this watch is not for women."
3,"shipping was a problem, but liked the panties","the crotchless part is a v shape, and it goes all the way to the waistband on both sides. you could wear it backwards, too, as it's just the same. i prefer a smaller hole down below so it doesn't show poochy tummy or c-section-type scars, but i've had fun wearing these! the shipping was a problem - didn't receive it for over a week past last due date, but i did receive it. i have a small bootie, and these fit fine, and would probably fit a big booty, too."
5,Never buy another cut off wheel - this is all you need,"I was very happy to find this cutting wheel and use it now in place of the original cut off wheels that came with my Dremel. For a ten spot give or take, you have a wheel that cuts through nearly anything and allows for precision work when needed.I have cut through metal piping, sheered screw heads that were stripped, and cut some locks open when we couldn't find the keys. I have yet to be disappointed. My Dremel and accessories such as the 545 Diamond Wheel are invaluable."
5,Cuts glass like butter,"I have been fixing a SUMP for a fish tank ant makes excellent cuts in 9mm glass, it cuts tile perfectly, the small cuts ofcourse, corners, pupes, etc, for large cuts I would not recomend it, you will take a long time , if you have firm hand you can cut curves like profesional. very good product."
4,A Welcome Rerelease,"DG has recently issued a series of Karajan recordings of the Beethoven symphonies mastered for SACD. These performances were recorded the Berlin Philharmonic back in 1963, and they have something of a grand style--smooth and big and powerful. Although these recordings may no longer serve as references for either performance or sound quality, there is pleasure to be found in listening to Beethoven performed in the Karajan way, which is sleek, smooth, powerful, and ingratiating. This is a welcome re-release."
3,A Little dry,"This was a fairly good book, in that it presented the issue with a perspective I'd not heard before. However, it was very redundant in that the author presented the same info over and over again, even using some of the same quotes repeatedly. The book could have been slimmed down by 20 or 30 pages and not lost anything. I also would have prefered more anecdotal information, rather than as much literature review as there was. The author also put in ""discussions"" at the end of each chapter, which were unnecessary if you were paying attention to the reading."
2,Not self-healing and cracks!,"I bought this cutting mat because the reviews were good. Maybe I got a dud or maybe it's just not meant for daily use...but my mat does not self heal and has started cracking along the edges. It didn't self heal even from the beginning but has progressively gotten worse. It also cracks just from being bent a little or from cutting down the same line over and over (I sell items I sew and use the same cutting lines frequently). I've used my mat almost every single day for the past 3 years sewing. Amazingly enough my smaller Dritz mat, which I've owned longer and used just as much, still looks brand new. It's time for me to buy a new mat and I'm probably going to go with Dritz or maybe Fiskars, either way, I'm done with OLFA."
1,Chemical Smell,As soon as I took this product out of the box there was a horrible chemical smell. Even after airing in the bathroom with the fan on for a day and then outside for another the smell was still going strong and gave me a headache. I returned the item for a refund
1,Great disappointment,I like the smell but once sprayed it would last only few minutes. Therefore it is useless and not worth the money spent.
3,Unsure,"I ordered this cologne because a friend of mine had it and I liked how it smelled. I realize some colognes will smell different on different people based on how the fragrance reacts to your skin. However, this smelled very different than what I remembered and I ended up returning it."
2,disappointed,"I recently purchased this product on a recommendation from a friend. I gave it to my husband for Christmas - we both like the scent but can never smell it even a few minutes after he has applied it. It seems no matter how much he uses neither of us can smell it after it's on him, even on his clothes. Even though the fragrance in the bottle is classic and subtle, it's very ineffective if you can't smell it at all."
5,Repeat buyer.,"This is my second order, needless to say, I am very pleased with the product and the service, both top notch. I followed the directions for the install and the connection was made to my network without a flaw. The price of the wireless PCI card is almost as cheap as cables cost, but much neater. I now have two remote PCs connected to my home network. I would recommend this company for anyone who wants good prices and excellent service.Joseph Signorelli"
4,It Works,This product works fine. The reception wasn't great but the router is on the other side of the house. But it does what I need it to do.
1,Doesn't work for Ad-hoc.,"I bought the WMP54GS to install in my windows XP emachine to run a simple ad-hoc network. My PC froze up. I called LINKSYS support; they said it was my DSL modem's fault. I called Verizon, and they said it was a LINKSYS problem. I installed, uninstalled and reinstalled the software many times; no fix. Now, the WMP54GS sits idle on my shelf. My suspicion is that the card is OK but NOT for ad-hoc networks."
1,Not For Me!,Installed and re-installed several times with no success. Did not work for me and got refund. Amazon was great as always and these things happen. Re-installed my original adapter. Thanks Amazon!
3,Great Once You Get Signal,"The card works great once you get it to associate with the router, but this can be a hair pulling experience. I tried for 5 days to get a connection, to little or no avail. I had connection but when I re-booted it never regained signal. I un-installed and re-installed the device 5 times. Still no signal, I was at my wits end and about ready to purchase the USB Adapter. As a last ditch effort I swapped PCI slots with my video card. The video card was above the adapter and the were very closely situated, with the fan from the video card almost touching the adapter. I turned the pc back on and reset the settings in the Linsys Monitor, hit connect, typed in my password, and have been connected ever since."
3,Great but...,"Great comfort with the Nike Air technology incorporated into the sole. The leather is high grade and it is a hand stitched shoe. Looks very well made. What you would expect from Cole Haan. However, after a year's wear the sole started cracking where the arch meets the rubber. One call to Cole Haan and they are replacing the shoes for free."
4,Free & Clear Glass Cleaner,This is my first time trying the Seventh Generations Cleaner for Glass and Surface (Free & Clear) Product. There were No amonia like fumes/smells compare to other products. Cleans glass fine.
4,JVC RX7020VBK DOLBY DIGITAL DTS RECEIVER,The receiver works great with DVD players. We set ours up to a JVC TV and a JVC DVD player and with the push of the button the whole system comes on. The only problem that I had with it was that it didn't have a A/B switch on it for the speakers. Other than that the price we found was a good price for what it had.
4,"Nice watch, but cannot see it in the dark whatsoever...","Nice looking watch, not real big, which is nice as my husband is not a big guy, and the huge watches they make now look like the guys are wearing clocks on their wrist... anyway the watch does advertise that the numbers illuminate in the dark, but only if you hold by a bright light for awhile, and then it only lasts a very short time, so if you need that feature look for a different watch. Otherwise it is rich looking (in a casual way) with nice crystal and really neat hands."
5,Excellent Movie,"I purchased this movie to add to my Tyler Perry collection. The movie is very touching as well as funny. All the Tyler Perry movies have a meaning to them even though some parts of the movie make you laugh. You can't go wrong with this movie, its heart felt but will also keep you laughing. Excellent movie."
2,Did Not Like It,This was not Tyler Perry's best work. I was surprised that Angela Bassett would agree to even do a movie like this. I probably will not watch it again.
1,Tyler Perry Please Stop!!!!,Once again Tyler Perry comes out with another stereotypical black movie! I felt sorry for Angela Bassett at this point in her career she should get offered better roles. I'm sorry but Tyler Perry movies are not funny. His plays are legendary but he has no idea how to make a decent movie. Who in there right mind would cast Angela Bassett and Rick Foxx as a couple? Movies are very different from plays. Many things that go over great in front of a live audience would never work in film. He tries too hard sometimes. His movies don't feel like comidies and they never quite stack up to any of his plays. In the 90's it felt like for the first time blacks were beginning to make quality movies for us all. Tyler Perry is definately not setting us back but he isn't raising the bar much either.
2,Better books about him,"There are better books about him than this. While a lot of the stuff he says in the book is also in other books, it comes off twisted. And contradictive. One part of the book stands out in my mind in particular.He talks about how James Dimon and how he couldn't join the board at Citi Group. He says in the book something like ""I told Jamie if he can convince the board to let him be a member then he should do so."" A few pages later, maybe 2, he talks about how Dimon got onto the board after all and Weill felt betrayed he would go behind his back like that to convince the board to letting him join.That last paragraph sums up the book pretty much. Full of contradictions."
3,Flogging a dead horse.....,"Originally criticised for sounding too much like a studio album on its first release 26 years ago, not much has changed with this digital re-hash of the original analogue tapes. The problem with Stage is that it just doesn't sound like a ""live"" recording. Bowie's delivery is almost identical to the studio versions of each song so wonders what ever was the point to ""Stage."" Sure it's great to have the set list returned to the original running order, but isn't this what we fans should have got in the first place? I can't wait for the fiftieth anniversary edition in 2028 - it'll probably just be THE ORIGINAL STUDIO TRACKS!!"
2,Borderline tent,"Tent is flimsey. Packaging advertised a rear zip window but there is no way to close the two mesh openings. If in a dusty location, you will have no way of keeping it or the wind out. Might be OK if cheaper and for summer use only."
3,"some good stories, some not so good","I just finished a collection of short stories from the works of Rudyard Kipling entitled ""Mine Own People"". It has an introduction by Henry James and has 11 stories in it and it published by The Regent Press. I have enjoyed some of the stories but found myself plodding through some of the others. I find that I can tell early on if a Kipling story is going to be enjoyable or not. Oftentimes his loses me early on and I become disoriented through the rest of his stories. This book had several stories the left me in that frame of mind. On the other hand there were also several that I found interesting or amusing. ""Bimi"" and ""Namgay Doola"" were two of the better stories. However, the best story was ""The Mark of the Beast"" in which an eerie tale of possession is told in a very engrossing manner. I'm always willing to give Kipling a try. I know that there are a lot of gems amongst the colorful sketches he wrote."
2,Mixed review,"I bought this product one year ago. I found it simple to use and have gotten alot of use out of it. After about 6 months, it stopped reading discs but I fixed that problem by buying a laser cleaner CD. Now at the one year mark, the machine is starting to stop recognizing new, blank discs altogether, which is very frustrating as I can no longer rely on it to record properly. It is time to retire this machine as a recorder and put it ""out to pasture"" to just play dvds. I have read numerous other reviews that give this model very low marks. It is time to buy a different brand of dvd recorder. As I said, I've gotten alot of use out of this model for the price. If you do buy one, don't expect it to last very long."
1,Closed Caption,This DVD/VCR combo does not read nor play closed captioning. MyBrother has a 100% hearing loss and really needs the closed captioning. I called Lite-On tech dept. and was informed that Lite-On DVD recorders do not read or record close captioning. I'm really surprised in today's technology their products are so inferior. So I had to return the unit.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I purchased this last week to digitize my stack of VHS-C and MiniDV camcorder movies. I've copied 30 tapes so far and have come across a very annoying issue. Sometimes (like 6 of 30) after dubbing VHS->DVD, the deck hangs flashing ""STOP"". Normally it should do this for 3-5 seconds as it finishes the DVD burn and then continue to normal operation. When it hangs, I'm left having to power down. When I power back up, 3 random scenarios 1) I have a coaster, 2) I lost the last 30minute dub but the disc is still intact, 3) Everything is fine. The deck is also a bit loud ( sounds like a computer DVD drive, not a consumer DVD deck ). It does work great for moving shows and movies off my Comcast-DVR box (Tivo Like) to DVD over S-Video. HQ (1hr) and SP(2hr) modes look good."
3,Good History - Little Cryptography,"An excellent historical survey of the era and astonishing depth of detail on the main protagonist, his life and times, but... regretfully, the cryptographic information in the book is scanty. One wishes for more detail in how he broke those codes.You will note a large number of used copies of this book for sale cheaply which seems to confirm my opinion. What we have here is an excellent history book in which the publisher cleverly spiked the title to make it appear to be more - it is not."
5,Great at Any Level!,"You can't study history without maps, so you always need an atlas of an area. This one's text, though, is an excellent beginner to intermediate level history, so with the superb maps you may not need another reference book on the subject. Yet, even if you've been reading about ancient Egypt for years you may find some new nuggets here, like the Egyptian rather than Greco-Roman names of the cities, the latest list of pharaohs (Hatshepshut was not the only ruling queen!), articles on the pantheons of different areas, plans of cities and temples -- all kinds of juicy stuff. If you haven't got it, and you're interested, take it home!"
3,Misleading Mitsumi product description,"I had been searching for a combo floppy/card reader drive and ran across this product at Amazon. I had seen various versions of this drive on other sellers' sites, at cheaper prices. I opted for this one because the product description touted its USB connection/power source. Great! (thinks I), maybe this is the NEW version of this product that will have solved all the problems and failures I read about on other web sites. The price is higher so that must mean it's the NEW product, right? WRONG.I just received the drive and haven't installed it yet. But whether it works or not isn't the point. Beside the USB cord on the back of the drive are a power plug and an ATA/IDE plug for the floppy disc drive! My impression from the (shameful con)Amazon product description was that BOTH card reader and floppy would be USB powered (many floppy drives are)."
5,Should have in the first place,Could not find these anywhere at reasonable price. I should have gone to Amazon first.
5,"So, What is the Scoop?","All this talk about JAG becoming available for release on DVD, has it happened yet? My 87 year old father loves this program, but can only see re-runs on ocassion as they air only sporadically in his area. He was in the Navy during World War II and this program is important to him. Please advise when this serires becomes available on DVD for regular Americans.Thanks, CharlieUSMC"
5,love the show,I just love this show! CBS should release the series on DVD in all regions as it is a brilliant show (much better than most other programmes on TV). Well worth seeing. Can't belive that the network screening Jag where I live has cancelled it!
3,Disappointed,"After seeing ""Move Over Darling"" I was for sure that ""My Favorite Wife"" would be twice as good because, you know it's the orginal. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant star in this movie (Cary Grant is one of my favorite actors). The acting seems a little fake...like when the wife comes home her mother-in-law is semi shocked. And in my opinion this movie is less funny than the remake. Again I feel like there's not enough emotion...for goodness sakes she's been on an island for 7 years!!! And I got frustrated at the end when Irene is so mean to Cary...even though he does look pretty funny in that costume (don't wanna give it away). But the end seemed to drag out way too long unlike ""Move Over Darling"". This movie is ok for Cary's movies but for a better version see the remake with Doris Day and James Garner."
3,A point for point deconstruction:,"A point for point deconstruction:This work focuses in analyzing ""the nine principles of war"" written by British General J.F.C Fuller in the original 1922 operations manual. Each of Fuller's Nine Principles are considered, and then contrasted to historical examples where the principle fails. It would have been nice to see Fuller's historical examples used, and if a rebuttal was necessary then to give one, but typically the other does not cite to Fuller in a case per case basis.Considering the age of J.F.C. Fuller's Nine Principles and perhaps due to this book's impassioned attack against them, they have been ""retired"" to the status of an appendix in the Marines current operations manual.This book will grow on you, it is good after several readings, but requires several readings to get its full meaning. I enjoy it now, but I hated it when I first bought it."
3,Essentially just more monsters,"Firstly, I bought this book sight unseen as I have a player who has practically an eidetic memory and he knows the ins and outs of a duck's bum when it comes to the Monster Manual (I to IV). So I was looking for anything different.The book is well-presented and each monster has its own black-and-white drawing. Editing is excellent and I can't remember any typos and the layout is simple and to the point.But its the monsters we wan't to know about. The descriptions are good and they are generic enough to fit into any campaign, and there are some really interesting monsters. The skywhale, with its potential to carry its own ecological domain on its back could be a very interesting setting, and the yoeman jelly has some very curious possibilities.Overall I think that Fantasy Flight Games have done a good job and these critters could be very useful in any campaign."
5,My teenage years!,"I have 2 old 45's by the Hilltoppers on ""DOT"" records. One is ""If I Didn't Care""(one of my favorites) on one side, and ""Bettina"" on the other. The other 45 is ""Sweetheart"" on one side and ""The Old Cabaret"" on the other side. I graduated in 1962 from Byram High south of Jackson, and we use to dance to these and all the other greats by the Hilltoppers at our school sock-hops. My boyfrind & I use to cruise around in his '57 Ford in the early '60's listening to all those oldies but goodies. Wow, if we could only turn back the hands of time, wouldn't that be great! But, the next best thing is we can still listen to our memories!"
3,Just the promise of future masterpieces,"I should warn that when I listen music I listen music, not texts. Thus, let's make review of music.""No Dancing"" - lovely superposition of solemnity and gentleness.""Alison"" - great composer's work: there are no two similar passages in one verse/chorus.""I'm Not Angry"" - excellent persevering guitar phrase.Single/bonus ""Watching the detectives"" - another example of composer's resourcefulness.But (my condolences) other songs are simply tribute to conjuncture. Flat, silly melodies with may be embryo of future brilliance. Only recitatives sometimes hold up (sometimes they don't) like in ""Welcome To The Working Week"".""Greatest debut of all time?.."" Don't be funny. It's just the promise of future masterpieces. E.g. ""Get Happy! "" that's really great."
5,Good value,"Forget the complaints about greed, the Rhino reissue is a ripoff in comparison to this. Shop around and you'll find it at a reasonable price. The live set is a thousand times better than the El Mocambo recordings and the demos on this release are a thousand times more interesting and better-sounding than the Honky Tonk demos."
3,"Good, but hardly perfect...","MAIT contains some great music indeed. If Watching the Detectives fails to floor you, you may not be human; the enraged I'm Not Angry is bile-filled and brilliant; Alison is perhaps not quite as wonderful as some would have it but still rather poignant; and Mystery Dance never ceases to be hysterically funny no matter how many times I hear it. On the other hand, if the album lost No Dancing, Sneaky Feelings, and Pay It Back it wouldn't be losing much, and the backing vocals on ...Red Shoes are cheesy beyond belief. Of course, you have to own it at some point, but please, start with This Year's Model, Armed Forces, or even Blood and Chocolate--if this is the first you hear of Elvis, you may find yourself a bit underwhelmed."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I'm sorry that I do not agree with the rest of the reviewers. Perhaps it is just that this type of book is not to my taste. I was expecting a vampire novel with an erotic element and an exciting plot. Well the vampire part is correct, but the rest was not there for me unless torture and impotence are erotic. It took more than three quarters of the book for the vampire and his mate to find mutual satisfaction in a less than erotic manner. The book was suppose to be a page turner, but for me the only page turning I did was to skip parts that were so boring and detailed that I could barely keep my attention focused on the plot. Clearly I am in the minority and most of the people who read Ms Squires' novels know and appreciate her writing style. This is my first attempt at reading one of her books and it will be may last. If you are looking for an erotic love story vampire style, ""The Companion"" is not for you."
3,It grinds,It's a grinding stone for a Dremel tool. It fits. It grinds. Just don't plan on using this for an industrial grinding stone and things will be fine.
4,Great for small metal grinding jobs.,"I bought this bit and a couple like it to grind some brass strikeplates in newly installed doors. This bit worked nicely. I was able to grind out a 1/4"" notch in a matter of a few minutes. Brass is a soft metal so I don't know how well this would work on harder metals, but for what I needed it worked very well. If you are doing alot of grinding you make want to get the multi-pack of these."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am very disappointed by this CD. The first 20 minutes or so are excellent, but after 20 minutes the rain sound is barely audible. As a result, the noises that I want to block, which necessitated the purchase of this CD, wake me up. This wouldn't be a problem if the CD had several tracks, so that I could just set the first track on repeat and listen to the first 20 minutes over and over again. Unfortunatley, the entire 60-minute CD is one single track. Now I'm stuck with a worthless CD and have to spend more money to find another way to cover up the street noise."
2,THIS CD HAD THE POTENTIAL BUT DIDN'T MAKE IT.,I HAVE LOT'S OF RAY ANTHONY CDS BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T MAKE THE GRADE. IT USED GOOD SONG SELECTION BUT THE ARRANGEMENTS DIDN'T WORK. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND MAKE IT TURN OUT RIGHT. OUT OF THE 16 SONGS LISTED I ONLY LIKE 5.
5,Lectura obligada para todo nuevo sacerdote,Este libro es una de las joyas de la literatura sobre la cultura afrocubana/yoruba. Lo recomiendo a todos los iniciados en el culto. Demuestra que esta religión gira alrededor de un cúmulo de leyendas que fundamentan sus ritos. Todos los libros de Mason deberían ser leídos y releídos con detenimiento.
1,"Neat cord, but....","That retractable cord is just phenomenal. Unfortunately it's connected to this garbage Kensington mouse. After a few hours of use the optical hardware started flickering, and eventually it just shut off. I can still make it light up once in a while, but never long enough to use it to navigate Kensington's website and tell them to get their act together. If yours isn't broken yet, then congrats for now. At least in a pinch I can still use the cord retractor on mine to make a Batman-esque escape. Right idea, wrong mouse/company."
1,Kensington Mouse................,"The idea of a retractable cord for a mouse really saves me time from untying tangled cords from my laptop case. The mouse has quite a good grip, and the scroller is actually quite pleasant. However, Kensington copied anyother companies idea, for i too, myself own another one of this kind of mouse, which is far better and was produced by a different company.In conclusion, all Kensington electronics are rubbish."
3,Great Design. But the mouse itself is the problem,"I really want to like this mouse. But i cant give in fully because despite the incredibly cool design then the mouse itself just stinks. The buttons are too stiff for me and the roller has no grip on it so it doesnt roll well.I realize im being very nitpicky but considering that this costs 40 bucks then i have high expectations. I really hope microsoft steals this retractable cord idea and ties it into one of their optical mice..BTW. the guy who reviewed this and said he didnt like the mouse because it copied another companies design is a dope. Why didnt he tell us what company he's referring to, and what exactly was his problem with the mouse?"
1,Mamet finally went over the top.,"Some people can't stomach Mamet's quickfire dialogue. Some hate his use of actors as automaton dialogue delivery devices. Others are bothered by the twist upon twist of his films. I believe that these are great to a point. That point was passed in this movie.The clever dialog turns to just plain non-sense. The plot is just jumbled weirdness. The wonderful actors talents are wasted.Try Heist, State and Main, or Spanish Prisoner."
4,shocking blooper,"What a SHOCK to open both of Sibley's Eastern and Western Field Guides and find Alberta transposed with British Columbia on the endpaper map at the back of each book. I opened a book at the back to read the bio and look at Sibley's photo and glanced at the map and I stared and stared, not believing my eyes. I checked all the provinces and states to make sure that was the only error. Other than that, these books are great, with super illustrations and I appreciate the range maps on the pages with the birds."
1,Horrible,Item was used and wet in the box. I remember this item. I never used it on my body because of the condition it came in. I now read reviews before I buy anything from any company on amazon. This was just a bad product and a bad experience.
1,Outstanding for as long as it lasted.,"I really thought this was a great brush. The balance is good, and the handle isn't slippery when wet at all. It has two speeds and did a great job. I didn't expect much for twelve bucks, so I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this thing worked -- that was for about five minutes. After that, gears inside its little head seemed to rattle and slip and eventually stopped rotating the brush entirely. Now, it just makes noise, leaving me with a twelve-buck back brush.This really is a good idea for a product and would definitely be worth more if a reliable company made one. Maybe one does. I'll certainly look for one and buy it if I find one. This, however, is just a cheap junk item, something to throw money away on either to see if it really does work or to give as one of those obligatory gifts to folks not at the top of our gift lists.Since none of my relatives read Amazon reviews, I might just buy a couple more of these."
1,Not worth even this price!,"I was really looking forward to getting this item. As I have difficulty with my joints, and movement in general I thought that this would be a valuable bath aid. It is not.It is far too weak to be of any practical use. After using it once the ""high"" setting barely spins, and the ""low"" setting might just as well be called ""off"". Pressing it against your skin causes it to just stop spinning, there simply isn't enough power for the SpinSpa to actually work. Even fresh batteries don't help.Although the pumice stone attachment is actually quite nice as well as two others, in the end they worked better when I REMOVED THEM from the SpinSpa and just used them by hand. Definitely not worth the price I paid to this company.If you are someone who needs a serious bath aid, save your money and pass this item by. I'm going to look at the other bath aids on this site."
1,Didn't Last,I bought two of these & both quit after 2-3 uses. It eats batteries at the rate of each use.Save your money and buy a washcloth and a paint stick!
2,It does spin...I'm not overly impressed,"The commercial for this had me sold...good job for the commercial. This item is not all that it is cracked up to be. The expoliating attachment is almost useless....it's design is too bulky to spin, thus it rolls around on your skin, without much proficiency. The other attachments don't feel like they do much because they don't lather the way a rag or other items do. I really got it for the pumice/pedicure feature. I supposed it ""pumiced"" my feet, but nothing to write home about. Chop this up to one of those gift items that don't live up to the hype."
1,Horrible experience with this product,"My 14-year-old daughter wanted a Spin Spa very much. When she finally got one, it didn't last 3 weeks. Something happened with the internal mechanism that causes the head to spin, and it stopped working."
2,a dissent on Zappa,"I bought this disc and was impressed at how clever and professional Zappa was. After a few plays, I was more struck at how juvenile he was, like Mad Magazine put to music. He had a very overblown sense of his own superiority and kind of a martyr complex that not enough people paid attention to him. But he was afraid to write lyrics about any genuine human emotion beyond simple disgust, which results in silly records. It's no surprise that his work remained obscure. Too bad, because he was clever."
2,songs cut too much,"While this cd contains some of Frank's best work, too many songs have been edited to make them shorter. FZ's songs tell a little story and removing parts of it prevents the listener from enjoying the full experience. Some of his better guitar solos have also been cut. They should have kept all songs full length and put them on 2 or 3 discs if needed."
4,it's zappa,"This was some of the first zappa music that I ever heard and it definitely turned me on. I think it gives you a good cross section of what frank was capable of. Everything from peaches en Regalia to Muffin Man which blew me away and got me very interested. From there I went on to buy Hot Rats, Joe's Garage, Apostrophe/Overnight Sensation, Bong Fury and many, many others. I think that just for the variations on Don't Eat The Yellow snow and Montana that this disc is justified. One final warning though, if this disc catches you, be ready for the ride of your life and the feeling of lifelong loss that you found Zappa after his unitmely death. Peace, Love and Good Happiness Stuff."
3,It works and look good!,"Replaced a sink with a Kohler sink , why not get the matching Kohler stamped flange and Sink Strainer? Made my project look even more designer all kohler branded. Great overall purchase."
3,Sony Mini disc carrying case,"The shipment of this product was really fast especially that it was sent to an apo adress, but as for the product itself I didn't really like it for the fact that it was lime green. I don't recall seeing it in that color when i saw it or even being given an option of what color to choose."
5,Silicon Spatulas,"I absolutely love these. You can use these for cooking scrambled eggs in your nonstick pans with no worry of melting or harming the nonstick surface.They are so durable, they still look new after many trips to the dishwasher. The red color keeps staining from showing when I use them for spaghetti sauce."
2,Another predictable story!,"I've always enjoyed Danielle Steel books, but the stories have become so predictable that I keep asking myself ""why do I continue to read her books?"" While I enjoyed reading many of her earlier books, I'm becoming more dis-illusioned with her writing. Her books have such a predictable cadence to them. They all ""read"" the same except that the storyline varies slightly! I read ""House on Hope Street"" on recommendation of friends and because of the online reviews. I thought maybe this book would be different. One thing that disappointed me was the length of the book ~ it is not a long book, barely over 200 pages, with large print! I'd really love to sink my teeth into a great book by Danielle Steel once again. Books like ""The Ring"", Jewels"" and ""Silent Honor"" I'm still waiting!"
3,Good story,House on Hope Street is a definate improvement from DS's latest works although not comparable to the books of ten years ago. At least in House we are not told repeatedly how perfect and beautiful all the characters are. There are some very moving parts. I recommend this book although if you are a first time reader check out some of her older works first.
4,Summertime reading,A short and but powerful novel from DS .... once you begin it is hard to put down. This novel reminded me of the importance of family and how blessed I am. Excellent reading for those summer evenings outside.
4,An enjoyable summer book,"I read this book pretty quickly and I must say it was very enjoyable. I felt a lot of sympathy for Liz and her kids and everything they went through. As in most Danielle Steel books, it ends well. A good, light read for the summer."
5,Another great read from Danielle Steel,"Like many of the other reviewers, I have and love all of Danielle Steel's earlier books. In the last few years, starting with The Klone and I, I became turned off by Ms.Steel's writing. In fact, I waited to read House on Hope Street and The Wedding until my name came up on the list at the library. Now, these two books will definitely be added to my collection. The House on Hope Street is a fast, easy, exciting read. I was in tears by page 61 and had to stop and put myself together. You actually feel the pain Liz has to deal with. You get wrapped up in her life, and by the end of the book, you can feel every emotion, good and bad. This book is a must for all of the early Danielle Steel book lovers."
3,Typical Danielle Steel,"I had not read any DS books for a couple of years and decided to download this one on my Kindle. While I enjoyed the story, as usual I was frustrated by how she spends about 3/4 of the book setting up the storyline and then rushes thru the last 1/4 to tie up loose ends and finish the story. It's almost like she gets bored and cannot wait to move on to the next book!!Lastly, I was very frustrated by the large number of typos in the Kindle version - not sure how that happens but it was extremely annoying!!"
2,Sorta Boring,This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff.
5,"Question, does it spring back open? This ad doesn't say.","I would like to buy this, but there is no information in the above description about whether it springs back open or not.I have a soft-jaw wire straightener that does not, and what a pain. So, maybe the company could include this information and more people might buy it. I have to give it 5 stars because they require me to rate it, and I don't want to hurt them by having this question."
5,Entertaining,"Hush Hanson is an FBI agent assigned to investigate a terrorist who is targeting trains. Assigned a controversial female subordinate, Hush finds himself in a race against time to discover the identity of the saboteur before he strikes again. Unbeknownst to Hush, the military has been transporting two aging Russian nukes along the same tracks.This was a very gripping story. Hush is a great male lead, entertaining, likeable and intelligent. His partner lang is a woman who is conflicted between doing her job, and palace games. I listened to the unabridged audio edition and found it gripping... Although the lengthy description of the sabotage the terrorist performs in the beginning of this tale could've had some editing. 5 stars."
4,The Story Still Works,"The idea of an individual seeking to right a perceived wrong through violent means is something that many writers have used in the past, yet few have done it in as gogent a manner as this writer. The story begins with three dostinct story lines that converge, as the book progresses, into a real page turner. The chacters have depth and become more meaningful as the story is skilfully woven. The witer is from the South and his personal knowedge and lifetime experiences come through well in this work. It is easy to ascertain that he has spent a goodly amount of time in research and this does much to enrich the work. His time in the military has taught him much about beauracracies and the ""back-stabbing"" and the manipulation of people that is commonplace. The characters are strong and serve to make this book a most satisfying read."
5,Just great,We have listened to the tapes for years. The CDs are just as good with the added advantage of finding specific passages quickly!
3,Packaging & Labeling,I have had this product for a year or so and we love it! We have been listening to it on the go--in the car and in our CD player in the kitchen.Just recently-I decided to play it on my computer. The problem I have is mislabelling--evidently these CD's had been re-written or something and the tract labeling is incorrect. This is minor and I paid $50+ after shipping a good price--now I see why- otherwise--we love the set.
5,Outstanding!,"Impacto Crea...a band whose members were all former drug addicts and alcoholics, grown out of a 1970's drug re-educatcion program. This was a band that had truly been there and done that, and who truly knew the meaning of the barrio. It gets truly no more ""real"" than this offering, and is absolutely stellar. Bobby Valentin produced this, which features Frankie Hernandez (former singer for Bobby Valentin Orchestra) on lead vocals. Also featured the legendary Cheo Feliciano on a couple of tracks, and Reinaldo Jorge on trombone. Remixed by Larry Harlow."
5,A WONDERFUL MIDNIGHT RAINSHOWER,"A wondrful experience of a midnight rainshower, I have played it every night since it arrived. The rain changes intensity enough to make you feel you are listening to it live, comfortable in your own bed. There are no really distracting sounds from the rainshower, like a bird or bug, just delightful rain for an hour. This CD is a delight and well worth the money."
5,Great Gift,I bought this book and another for my father. He was on the USS Enterprise during his time in the navy and has recently started reading old war books. Great price and arrived very quickly. My dad was happily surprised when he opened this gift. I don't expect he'll ever read the whole book but he's read bits and pieces of it since Christmas.
5,A execelent history.,"The book covers, in detail, the history of the Enterprise in World War II. I especially enjoy how personal comments and points of view were coveered. It was written almost like an historic novel, with detailed discription and accounts of the battles of Midway and Santa Cruz. The telling of the scene a Pearl Harbor is excelent. The heroism of the crrew is shown in many stories. This book is a must for all who love the history of WWII, It was well researched and very well written."
2,Hmph,"I don't know about other people, but I thought that movie was pretty horrible. Given, fight scenes were OK, but the dialogue was just horrid and half of the movie was just uncoordinated yelling and growling. The storyline was alright, but badly executed. Van Damme did fine on the fight scenes, but the rest of the movie was lacking at best."
4,So bad it's good,"OK. Let's cut right to the chase here. This is a terrible movie.It is in fact, so bad, that is transcends badness. It's a trite saying but it really does. There aren't many movies where the topless women aren't perfect in all respects. And you'd never expect them to say ""I'll understand if you're not here in the morning."" (actual line!)Other gems of dialogue include: ""We can make a better world!"" ""I like the world the way it is."" ""Go to Hell!"" ""Been there.""You can't find that in just any movie!Of course, since JCVD isn't really worried about showing that he's a brilliant actor, and is instead concentrating on showing how bad he is, you don't really pay much attention to anything but the fighting. And the fighting is rather good."
4,This Movie Has a Message,"I realize this movie is campy by today's standards, so only someone who watched it back in the day when it was a different era in movie making can appreciate it. I'd say you'd have to be at least 25 to enjoy it, because of it's sentimental and nostalgic atmosphere.If you can get past that, it's actually really good. I've always enjoyed postapocalyptic reality-of-life depictions. The music is a bit much, but it does portray survival of the fittest in a realistic sense. The characters beat each other up a bit unbelievable and the breaking-himself-off-the-cross scene was absurd even then, but the fight scenes are well done and closefaced showdown scenes were gold. Definitely one for the collection."
4,"Ok, this is really bad, but......","as another viewer pointed out its so bad its good! Lets face it, this WAS the film that made JCVD famous - not Bloodsport. The acting is goofy and the plot thin, but its kind of like a pringles potato chip- you cant eat just one and leave it at that. You'll find yourself watching this again and again."
3,cheesey movie but great haunting music,"I admit, the movie is not GREAT, but I love it. I have seen it so many times that I have come to love the music in it, however I haven't found that a soundtrack exists.The movie itself is set in the post-appocolyptic era. A plague has covered the world and people are dying fast. A cyborg has recently obtained information that would help find a cure, but she is being hunted by the ""bad guys"". Van Damme steps in to make sure her journey is safe. Along the journey, he keeps having flash backs of the love that he lost (to the ""bad guys"") and the children (I think her younger siblings) that were traveling with her. Van Damme comes to discover that one of the youngest children was not killed afterall, but was now grown up and traveling with the ""bad guys"". In the end, the guy gets the girl and the cyborg makes it to her destination safely.Good (not great) action fights. Poor plot, but sort of like a cult classic (at least in my mind)."
5,Blues de la frontera,"Bone-shaking, soul-piercing flamenco-blues and flamenco-jazz. The musicians are phenomenally talented and innovative. This is a classic album that transcends genre."
2,Great handle wimpy blade,I have had a construction company for 15 years we needed some new placers to work concrete. I orderd the tool and found it to be very light and easy to handle. but after 2 uses the blade is already bent and had to be fixed by HAND. It's too bad that a tool with a lot of promise has to have one part made so well and the other made so [poorly] that you can't use the tool!
5,A passionately written and emphatically spiritual testimony,"It's All About Him!: The Doctrine Of Christ by Bishop Nate Holcomb (founder of ""Christian House of Prayer Ministries"") is a book specifically written for Christian and lay leaders about turning away from the greedy demands of the self and embracing Jesus Christ as one's savior. Focusing on six guiding principles, and explaining spiritual lessons about the seven types of baptisms, the purpose of ""laying on of hands"", and the resurrection of dead and eternal judgement, It's All About Him! is a passionately written and emphatically spiritual testimony, supporting Bishop Holcomb's interpretations with numerous Biblical quotes. It's All About Him! is a confidently recommended addition to any non-denominational Christian Studies reading list."
5,Dremel 5 pack,"The 3"" 5 pack blades are good, but I especially want to praise the Bic Supply people for such prompt service.The 8030 pack was delivered in a rain storm."
3,"Great card, Poor production","While the the fight card on this DVD is of a high quality, the DVD as a whole is a disappointment. There is no introduction at the start of the card by Rogan and Goldberg as seen on the ppv. There are no video intros to give us a brief background on the upcoming fights as there is on the ppv. There are no post-fight interviews in the octagon with Joe Rogan. The fighters are not even introduced in the octagon by Bruce Buffer! On the whole there is a substantial amount of missing content that is essential to giving UFC fight cards their identity. Poor Production."
5,Just what I wanted,"After reading other reviews of this laptop desk, I purchased it -- and it's perfect for my needs. It wasn't exactly easy to assemble -- but not that difficult either. I'm using it as I write this. I love that I can move it around easily, and also lock the wheels. Very pleased with this purchase!"
1,Huge Price Change,"When I came to this page, the item was listed for $23.00 I clicked to add it to my cart and the price changed to $89.00 in my cart. I won't be trusting this company anymore."

2,What is with this cheap amimation?,"Okay. To start I'm used to seeing snow, and after seeing the animated Herc and Xena...I'd rather watch snow (as in static snow at the end of the tape. Yes, don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of Hercules and Xena. And beacuse of the bounderies live action possesses I was completely thrilled that it was decided: that a cartoon was to be made. YA-HOO! It would have been great too. The original cast and a really great story idea, that could have easily spawned sequels...in a word Sucked ( just because of the cheap(I can't draw) artist!?! rendition of the actors and the really slow, throw back to 1960's anmimation. Why? Oh, the humanity. The (movie) Gods should be merciful, and never allow the same artists to ever create another cartoon again. Thanks For Listening, The movie amazon, MOUSE"
5,WATERPROOF STEREO HOUSING,THIS JENSEN MARINE WATERPROOF GIMBLE MOUNT STEREO HOUSING IS A EASY TO USE AND INSTALL. I'M VERRY HAPPY WITH IT AND MY STEREO FIT GREAT.
5,Price couldn't be beat!,"I wanted to replace the 10 year old houseing I had so I searched around and could not find a cheaper houseing then right here on Amazon. What Impressed me was Is I didnt have to cut all the radio wireing again and pass is through the new houseing. The top is off when it arrives and all that needs to be done is for you to insert the radio and feed the wires through the back wire feed on the back of the houseing. Next just screw the top back together with the bottom and mount the legs. I personally like the extra pocket on the side, I have a slim cell phone that fits perfect right in there.Going to place order for an AM/FM antenna now :-)"
4,Does the job,"I installed this under the console of a new flat bottom boat. My main complaint is the price of the unit and the door is a bit tricky to open and shut. I do not mind that much, as it keeps the kids from messing with it. Also, the side pocket could be a little deeper, seems like it is only half the depth it could be.It kept the rain out of the stereo in the monsoon we went through on the last fishing trip, so I am pleased with my purchase."
5,what a deal!,"I grew up with Corelle dishes as a little girl and till this day, my parents still have the complete set! They are durable without being heavy. We always use to keep paper plates in the apartment because our heavier ceramic type set is so heavy- it makes you never want to do the dishes lol! these plates are so lightweight and pretty, and dishwasher safe! THIS IS A DEAL!"
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting durable thick plates, but instead these are flimsy and look like a child's toy set. The bowls are tiny and the plates very thin. What a dissapointment. I'll know next time not to base my judgement on pictures and reviews."
2,"Not good, But not bad","The plates look okay, But the feel very thin and cheap. The bowl's are small and probably wouldn't use them at all. The coffee cup's are a good size and feel thick. Everything else feel cheap and thin. I have some dollar store plates that feel better made."
2,"Yes, out of date","This book was well written for its time but Google no longer uses the formulas found in this book. Any book written before August 2005 should be considered out of date at this point. At that time Google introduced the concept of 'Quality Score' and that changed things quite a bit. Google also recently (December, 2007) changed the way it analyzes the associaton of keywords, ads, CPR, and site content. So the basic concepts of this book are fine but the specifics have moved on. I wish I had read the review from October, 2005 entitled ""Nice but...it's obsolete""."
1,Delivered with cover ripped off,I am very disappointed with this purchase- The book came in two pieces with the cover ripped from the rest of the book
5,Hotshoe,"If you like the old gumshoe type novels you will love this on, Jerry Smith's writing style reminds me of John D. McDonald's Travis McGee novels. The storyline of the this novel is also helped out by the authors familiarity with the motorcycle world. Well written, a can't put it down book. This author has another book, Deadman's Throttle which is the prequel to this book. This novel can be read without having read the first novel as Mr. Smith has written both to stand alone without loss of the story line by not having read the first, again much like the Travis McGee novels of John D. McDonald."
4,Not for the novice.......,"These cards are absolutely gorgeous in the true Art Nouveau style. However, they are SO stylized that the individual cards often don't have the ""standard"" look of a card of that arcana or number. It requires having at least a basic understanding of what each card represents, in advance, to work with them."
3,Pretty Images Lend To Untradtional Look,"I love the Art Nouveau period and the cards in this deck are quite lovely. Both males and females are flowing, sensual, and inviting. The artist chose to leave out all but the basic symbolic images: sword, chalice, wand, and pentacle. This last, though, doesn't stay true to suit. I don't get the reference of a female silhouette replacing the five-pointed star usually associated with this suit. It makes the deck difficult to read. I am not well versed in the history of tarot imagery and, therefore, may be missing the symbolism. The other three suits are depicted in a much more traditional manner.If you're looking for a pretty deck, this is a good one despite the above glitch in image interpretation."
1,Very weak vacuum.,"This sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use. It removes the air with a fan. There is air left in the bag, it doesn't create a vacuum. The bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid. The bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag. I was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags. They are thinner than Ziploc bags. You cannot use canisters with this one."
3,Josh Groban - Closer,Wasn't thrilled with the CD as a whole. There are 2 songs on there that are wonderful.
3,NOT A GOOD BUY,MIXING BARREL WOULD NOT STAY UP AFTER 3 HOURS OF USE FROM THE FIRST TIME I BEGIN USE IT. THERE SHOULD BE A MANUFACTURER RECALL ON THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE TO USE C-CLAMP TO KEEP THE BARREL FROM TILTING OVER.
1,DO NOT BUY. Amazon - please remove this item,This item will NOT play on US DVD Players. Warner are aware of the problem and are fixing it. AMAZON - please remove this item until the DVDs with the right region code becomes available.
4,The best at the moment...,"It is well a book documented, presenting a scientific part very well studied and deepening well the genetics. The function practices and of description of the species it is very good and we can find details worthy of a great creator of Agapornis. I just criticize the great exhibition of roseicollis mutations, leaving of part many mutations already existent in the nigrigenis, fisheri and lilianae. My congratulations to the author and its work."
3,Such a shame...,"It is such a shame that this well produced book and with a comprehensive and very informative text is completed with such a poor collection of photographs. Lots of big format off focus shots, weird colors... Cannot understand why the author did not pay more attention to this very important thing, the title of the book being 'The Colored Atlas of...'. A REAL pity."
1,Crappy Hardcore!,"Somehow this event has gained almost legendary status among wrestling fans, for reasons that I don't know. All of the matches are terrible, with the exception of the Funk/Foley final, which is very entertaining. Except for Funk/Foley, the matches in the King of the Death Match tourney are all about five minutes in length, and are laughable attempts at a death match, and/or hardcore wrestling. The Dan Severn match is passable, but he is a bland personality. The Funk/Foley final is historic (probably because every wrestling fan has seen clips) but the finish is terrible, and you can hear them call spots. But still, they bleed buckets, which should satisfy the hardcore vampires. If you must by this, skip to the Funk/Foley final. Everything else is terrible."
1,"""What did he say! ""","If it wasn't for the fact that my daughter worked on the movie, I would have turned it off in five minutes....and, whoever did the audio track.............ugh!"
1,Utterly SUBSTANDARD,"Unbelievable! Pay $25 PER BLADE and when we go to put them to use on our NEW METAL ROOF they chewed the edge, barely cut and scraped the paint off on our first cut!! Ended up using hand cutters for the rest of the project. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
2,This ain't this author's first book? Say what?!!!,"Come on now. This was the silliest book I've ever read and I'VE READ A LOT! I tried to give this author the benefit of the doubt, thinking this was her first time until I read one of the other reviews that said: This is not Ms. Stanhope's best. Say what? You mean there's more? Okay, I'll go easy on Niqui, but before you buy this book, think FAIRTALE before you spend your money. There was nothing believable in this novel whatsoever! Lola needs to go sit down somewhere!!!"
1,Concerned about Amazon's pricing scheme rating based on false pricing scheme,I got an email saying this set was on-sale for 19.99. So I went to buy it but on the site it says that it is on sale for 29.99 shipping from Target. So I went directly to the Target site and was amazed to see the list price is only $32.99 yet Amazon has their list price at $50+. Makes me wonder what else they have over priced. I like to shop at Amazon but now I am concerned. Make sure to double check the prices else where.
4,Correll Sandstone Dinnerware,"I bought two of these sets to replace a service of 12 Pfaltzgraff ironstone dinnerware. I was tired of the heavy dishes in and out of the dishwasher and cupboards. Love the light weight and all the room I now have in my cupboards. A nice timeless design and color goes with most any linens and flatware. You can dress them up or down. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I find that the mugs tend to stain if not rinsed out immediately. If you don't they come out of the dishwasher with dark rings still in the cup. But, I like them enough to have ordered another service of 4."
5,Great Dishes,"Have long been a Corelle fan. On rare occasions, a piece will break if it is dropped just right on concrete!Love it!"
4,"Great everyday set, matches any additions","If you are not used to corelle you should know it is much lighter/thinner than ceramic, so you will be able to feel the difference. However I find it to be great for everyday...doesn't stain, doesn't break, not fancy but looks nice. This pattern is a light beige color will match pretty much anything."
1,Rubbish,Don't buy this. This is nothing but a few interviews ripped off of YouTube and put on a DVD. Complete waste of money!
2,Poor Picture and Sound,"The show is good as ever, the price is decent... But, wow, you'd think they would have remastered the content or used a clean source. The picture and sound are really poor-- fuzzy, muted, and muddy. I'd say VHS quality at best. I guess its authentically retro, because it looks and sounds almost exactly like I remember it as a kid over the rabbit ears antenna...I've got dozens of 80's cartoon sets: GI Joe, Transformers, Voltron, He-man, and this is the lowest quality of all. The others show its possible to release a high quality set on DVD but this one feels like a cut-corners money grab. The packaging is cheap (plastic DVD case with sleeve) and the extras are pointless as well.*Note* The reviews for the 2011 and 2005 box sets seem to be merged together. I'm reviewing the new cheaper (2011) set on 2 discs. However the older (2005) box set has over twice as many episodes for only a little more money making it a better value."
1,A Senseless movie,"Its a shame for India to have such a director who projects our own country in such a terible manner.The movie is not at all something that we can view.If he has so much care for the people, then why does he not fight against it in India itself and go to various places in India to make people aware of this.We know that this used to happen in the 16- 17 th century and as late as the 18th or early 19th century. But now a days it is just a one of case where it is more individualistic and not a religious practice.As we know, Mr Digvijay Singh is a very low profile director who wants to make it Big some way or the other and so has directed this movie senselessly.RaviUSA"
3,Wheel of Fortune 2,To much time wasted on introduction and closing the game out. It could be simpler on telling you where players stand.
4,Enjoyable CD.,"This sampler CD is very enjoyable, since compilates some unusual but nice and interestingorchestral pieces in good performances and sound. The headline for the CD is very appropiate."
5,BEYOND PLEASED,"I purchased this TV and it has working wonderfully for over two years now. I have had no problem with it what so ever. The picture is great. The DVD and VHS work wonderfully and I love not having separate gagets since I am not very techy. I am writing this review now because I am looking for another of the same to gift to my Mom and to my Sister and I see that Amazon is out of stock. I am happy and beyond pleased with this Toshiba 24"" TV-DVD & VCR I only regret not getting it sooner."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"WE too like another posting had a power outage for about 1 second and it blew the TV. The other brand of tv downstairs was unaffected.Highly NOT recommended. After seeing everyone else on the net say they received no compensation from Toshiba, I'm not hopeful."
4,Great combo,This was a good purchase because it has both vhs and dvd player. It has held up well too. It still works today
2,Damaged,"Dont' know if this is a fair review, but this TV came dented and damaged and didn't work. I bought it for my aunt, who then had to ship it back. Big dissapointment."
3,It's Different,"true, this is not one of his best works. ... have you not ever heard headhunters, thrust, and some other 70's stuff."
5,Had to buy a 2nd copy (just in case!),"My daughter, who is 5 months old, loves this book. It has taught her the whole concept of peek-a-boo while also allowing her to look at cute pictures of animals and to learn their sounds. I am buying a second copy b/c I know she will soon tear this one up (she kicks her legs wildly when I read it and tries to grab for the pages which come down as each animal peeks out)! I highly recommend this and will make this a standard baby/shower gift for friends from now on!"
4,look at life during the civil war,most interesting book about how the times were during the civil war for the civilians who were caught up in the conflict. how they had to deal with deprivation during the occupation. would be interesting to read about how the poorer people had to deal with it.
5,Surprised,"I heard bits and pieces of this musical online. I became interested in the fact it was about a brother and sister, and that relationship affected their lives. So I bought it. My sister and I are close and seeing these songs reminds me of hard hitting times we both have face.As I've learned this is one of Andrew Lippa's earlier musicals. His level of talent is immense here. His melodies are great. But there is much for complexity in the music, but his words seem to bring the music to a whole new level.I loved this musical because it really pushes the boundries and helps us reflect on our relationships with others. Also, it shows how the future is reflected by the past. It forces you to realize not to live in the past nor forget...but to grow from the past.The vocal strength and talents of the cast ring true the words...""Actors are to writers as angels are too God."" If you get the opportunity buy this cd...it's worth every penny."
3,Tolman re-bar cutter,"The bender that we bought was the 1st open type. We had already purchased 2 of the closed cutter units. What I did not realize with the open type is that you are not suppose to cut grade 60 re-bar with it. After the purchase we read the instructions given with the unit and discovered this info, I am disappointed that this was not stated in the info given prior to purchase. Time will tell how long it will hold up, do to the fact that grade 60 re-bar is all we purchase."
2,Not if you want to read Thomas Aquinas,"This book is about the author's views and exposition of the life, times, and criticism of St. Thomas Aquinas' philosophy. It does not contain the writings in any meaningful or significant way. I was really disappointed."
4,Paddington Bag,"This bag looks very nice and its soft to the touch. After 2weeks of carrying it however, the paddlock does not lock anymore it keeps dropping on the floor. I've had to take this out which make the bag less beautiful. I hope this is just a one-of though."
3,Not really for cutting,"This bit is of very high quality, but it is more of a grinder than a cutting bit. I needed something to cut a fairly intricate design in thin wood for miniature model sets and it didn't take much wood off, I used a routing bit to get the bulk of the wood off then used this bit to do more ""sanding"" of the edges.As always the dremel brand bits are of very high quality."
3,review by author of 17years,The book was well written enough I just found the story a little slow for my taste. I have read better books by this author.
2,Not what I expected,"I am disappointed with the format, which I find difficult to follow and understand. I don't have official ""Brain Gym"" Training, and the book certainly doesn't explain things well enough to stand alone. The illustrations are awful -- you would think you are reading something published 40 years ago! I even bought the ""student edition"" (small orange book)in hopes it would help. No luck!I found MUCH better descriptions of the movements on YOUTUBE, and could have skipped the books altogether."
5,Most enjoyable,This DVD is able to capture any one's attention who walk by to view the performance. Very well done.
2,world music,"The best songs here are those which are not trying to crossover. Special mention to Mikey Dread. Not up to his 'Dread at the Controls' album but still...and then, just when you are feeling slightly let down, the voice of angels, Dzintars a womens choir with angel voices..."
1,Worst product ever! ---- Don't buy it!,"Don't buy it! After setting up this gem of a TV/DVD Combo, everything worked fine. However after less than 3 hours of use, the dvd player stopped working! Toshiba was NO HELP! NO TECH SUPPORT ON OR OFF LINE. They want me to bring it to one of their very few service centers. This place is over 50miles from my home. ""I Don't think so""! When the dvd player starts, I get a error message (incorrect Disk) with a disk that allready played ONCE! I have tried several other disks, with the same results! So now I just have a very expensive plain TV!... Frist and last Toshiba product for me!!!"
4,Fine by my standards,It's a TV with a sharp image and a good dvd player. I would have liked the dvd player to be able to play vcd's but you can't expect a range of features out of a basic built in model. I recommend this tv for anyone who is looking for a mid to high end model.
1,stick with staples,"Sounds good, but not so much. Papers don't stay ""stapled"" and if you put more than 3 pages together it jams and there is no way I've found to un-jam it because it is plastic and fragile. Buy a stapler."
3,Read the instruction!,I got this as a gift for a friend at work and she broke it in less than 10 seconds!! She was so excited that she decided to put almost 10 pieces of poster type paper in it to staple. The instruction clearly stated no more than 4 pieces... so make sure you guys read the instruction before using. This thing really could break in a flash.
4,Cool concept -- just make sure you're using correctly,"it's a cool concept, really, but don't make the mistake of sticking the page corners into the ""stapler"" or you'll end up with a chewed up corner. You must ""staple"" by sticking a flat edge into the stapler... then it works great. Definitely won't staple many pages, but perfect for a few... and is great for what I needed it for!"
2,Broke immediately,"I bought this stapler for classroom use, but after one morning in my classroom, this product was broken beyond repair. It was such a shame because we go through so many staples in a classroom, I was hoping this would provide an easy substitute. I might consider getting another one and trying at home, but it definitely doesn't hold up to use by children."
2,To Many Problems with this Model,"We have used this printer for about 13 months. It has already been repaired onces where the problem was not fixed. It currently does not print correct color, scan correct color and feeds the paper incorrectly. We our at the point of thinking that this printer is so broken that we have to replace it.Also half the time it says the ink is out. At times we put new ink in and it still says the ink is out. We are diffently not going look at brother printers as a replacemnt considering this one barelly lastest a year."
3,It has something...,"This is certainly not your ""classic"" fantasy book. Action, adventure wonder and breathtaking scenery are definitely missing, and even the characters are quite ""run of the mill"". It' s more of a ""philosophical"" book who tells the story of a sligthly fantastic and very simple world. And here' s the catch: this book actually has a charm of its on, is written in a very fluid way, and can be even somewhat inspiring, but it 's overall too simplistic and superficial. The characters, the world, the ideals, the morals, the drama end up feeling fake and shallow compared to what real existence is. It has a value though, like a little. light, fresh flute musical diversion."
3,Retro surf music that's fun to listen to:,"I got this CD simply to complete my theme song collection, but found myself listening to the whole CD over and over again. These pieces of background music do very well on their own. THE BATUSI will have you doing the twist and the GATHOM MUNCIPAL SWING BAND seems very timely with the recent resurgence of swing music. All this plus the Batman theme song from the 60's TV show. If you liked Booker T. and the MG's, US3 or Dick Dale, this Tongue-in-cheek Album by Neal Hefti is something you might want to check out."
2,"Jazzy muzak, well-made but unmemorable","Other than the title theme, the tracks on this disk have little association with the television program (the show's theme was penned by Hefti, the scoring generally done by Nelson Riddle). Most of this CD is middling jazzy muzak, although done with some wit and flair. The ""Batman Theme"", which was a minor chart single, suffers without Hal Blaine's propulsive drumming that made the television version so memorable. An interesting period piece, but nothing to get excited about."
4,"""BATMAN"" THE ORIGINAL TV SOUNDTRACK ALBUM","track listing:1) Batman Theme2) Evil Plot To Blow Up Batman3) Sewer Lady4) The Mafista5) Holy Diploma, Batman - Straight A's!6) Eivol Ekdol, The Albanian Genius7) The Batusi8) Just A Simple Millionaire9) My Fine Feathered Finks10) Mr. Freeze11) Jervis12) Batman Chase"
2,"Too Thin, Not Applicable","There was too little applicable information for me. I am using LotusScript in Lotus Notes and after reading the entire book, I came away feeling like I didn't learn anything I could apply usefully."
5,Smooth operator,I'm using it on stainless steel. Works well as one would expect. Not quite as classy as my wife's stud earrings.
5,"Gregory Hines, A Truely Great Hoofer","Tap (Widescreen Edition)Gregory Hines shows what tapping is all about. His co-stars include some of the greatest black hoofers who ever lived, like Sammy Davis Jr. Gregory's feet may be silenced but anyone wanting to know about tapping should study this great talent. The bonus features include interviews with some of the old timers of black tappers."
3,Tap,"DVD arrived unopened, however it was shipped in material that sticks to the plastic and when I attempted to open the package, I had no choice but to open the DVD as well. Needs a little more care with packaging."
5,Worked VERY well for me!,"I had tried several of the drug store common ones that have the Zinc active ingredient (Head and Shoulders, etc) and they all helped minimally, but the problem was still there. After literally ONE use of the Sebulex, the dandruff was 95% gone. I'm on my third wash now, and have no flakes whatsoever. Its pricier than most, but you get what you pay for! It leaves a sulfuric smell in your hair that eventually wears away (or you get used to it). I wash with the Sebulex first, then use a cheap fragrant shampoo to mask the odor and that seems to work well. In any case, the slight sulfur smell is well worth the outcome!"
3,The product had a more pleasant odor than ...,"The product had a more pleasant odor than the tar-based dandruff shampoos. It also seemed to be as effective and as convenient to apply. Hence, I'd purchase the product for daily use. However, I've found that during the course of long-term use, the performance of dandruff shampoos tends to decline. So I've found it necessary to rotate them."
4,best dandruff - no bad scent,I've tried a number of tar based dandruff shampoos and none were effective for very long. I've been using sebulex for a few years. I have not had any flaking and it has a neutral oder.
2,not so great,"did nothingmore thatn the average product that you can pick up in any grocery or drug store, disappointed that I spent money on this"
3,Seems to do the job,Why am I required to write 14 words here to Submit. This is a stupid idea. Something I would expect from Ebay--but not from YOU!
3,lock is heavy!,Nicely made and not a bad size to carry. The hardware is heavy and adds weight to the bag. Have gotten compliments on it!
4,I'm surprised,"at my unusually low rating! I would agree that this is not one of his very best....and if you are new to the world of Dr. Delaware, I urge you to try another. In my old age I am unable to recall when or how I first stumbled onto Jon and his magnificent writing but I savory each and every click of purchase, always reserved for special reading occasions. Hey, I do not want to run out! This one could have used more story, more depth in characterization, less wallpaper details. But child psychology was my field before retirement and I wanted to see how he addressed this particular puzzling issue of child abuse. Few of us clinicians understand the whys of it but Jon does a great job in his efforts to do so. He and his writer wife remain on my list of people I would enjoy sharing a meal and conversation with, along with Jesus, Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock :) !"
5,Kellerman At His Best!,"This is my favorite Jonathan Kellerman novel. The book focuses on a disturbing story about Munchausen's Disease by Proxy. This book so quickly caught my interest, that I ended up doing my psych 101 paper on this disease. I had not heard of this disorder when I read the book. It was disturbing, intense, and tore away at your heart. I would definitely recommend this book! Munchausen's Disease seems to have become a more popular topic since I read this book. I have seen countless documentaries on, and it was also featured in the newest episode of House. It is a disturbing, yet intriguing disease, and this book delves straight into the ugliest form of it, Munchausen's Disease by Proxy."
2,"Handles all black, all look the same. Otherwise OK.","Black and white picture does not reveal that they are all the same color: Clear handles with black inserts.The size is labeled in white on one panel of the black handle, and the 3/8"" size was not labeled at all.If you don't mind this, then they are decent set for the price, fair quality, and look strong enough that they would never break or strip using simple human hand torque.Handles are a little small for big hands, unless you don't need much tightening force.I would prefer different colored and bigger handles, then they would be four or five stars, for the price."
2,TIGI Catwalk Curlesque did not do anything for my wavy curls,"* Sorry, but TIGI Catwalk Curlesque did not do anything for my wavy curls* Now I wish I could have tried the original version especially because I did not even get on sale!"
1,Great product but amount in container is not what was described in advertisement,"The listing for this product describes a 5.7 ounce package:http://www.amazon.com/Bed-Head-Catwalk-Curls-Amplifier/dp/B000VZ9UFU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1295717244&sr;=8-1The box arrived in a timely manner, but it contained a smaller package of only 4 ounces in size.Hopefully this was just an oversight on the part of DealSeekers/SalonSavings.We have contacted them and are awaiting a reply."
2,Not the same,"Wife is saying that the product is not the same since they changed the packaging and ingredients. She has extremely curly hair and is complaining that it ""doesn't hold the way it used to"""
3,Good product,"First time I tried it. It's a good product, you only need a small amount to make it work, if you combine it with a little bit of water."
2,"""the tears on my pillow bespeaketh the pain in my heart""",I am absolutely devastated that TIGI discontinued their curls rock amplifier!! I have used TIGI's original Curls Rock product for almost a decade and nothing else has compared to it. This new Curlesque version just doesn't have the chops. It doesn't have the great hold or definition that the old version had and left my hair frizzy and lifeless.
2,Leaves hair greasy,"I had heard some great reviews on this product from friends and was excited to try it out. My hair is wavy and will curl with the right product (usually spray gel). I often use John Frieda's Frizz Ease to help keep the volume down and was hoping for something similar or better with CurlsRock. Sadly, it does nothing for my hair - adds a little weight but kills the curls and leaves my hair super greasy even if I only use a little. I am very disappointed overall."
2,Frizzy,My thin curly hair is frizzy with this product. Also It doesn't smell as good as the original. Definitely like the original Curls Rock better!
2,There Is A Better Choice for Antarctic/South Georgia Birding,"I was extremely frustrated using this book on my recent trip to Antarctica and South Georgia. Some of the plates do not do an accurate job of depicting the birds and the distribution maps are also not entirely accurate. The professional ornithologist on my trip agreed with my observations and recommended that I purchase another book: ""Birds of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, and the Antarctic Peninsula"" by E. Couve and C. Vidal."
4,A good guide for a beginner,"It was the first time for me in South America, so I didn't know nothing about the birds there. I had the chance to find this guide, which helped me very much, thanks to the good figures. The text is a little bit poor, but for a beginner it's enough. For some families like the Furnariids and the Tyrannids the figures weren't always good for recognising the species in the field. But, in general, I found this guide very useful and the best between all other guides of the region which I saw."
3,Southern South America Field Guide,"This appears to be a compact but comprehensive field guide to the birds of southern South America. The art work is adequate, but the plates are crowded and disorganized, and it is sometimes difficult to find the specific number you are looking for to coordinate with the printed information. The other drawback is that the range maps are at the back of the book, a failing common to many older guides. In the absence of anything better, this should serve the purpose well."
4,Second best for Chilean Patagonia,"I took this book and also Birds of Chile by Alvaro Jaramillo with me to Chilean Patagonia. I found the Jaramillo book better. The bird names are on the plates by the illustration whereas in Birds of Southern South America many more species needed to be illustrated so they are numbered on the plates. Also, Birds of Chile puts the range maps opposite the plates, and in full color. Birds of Southern South America puts the colorless maps at the back of the book. Still, it's a good field guide, but covers a broader area than I needed for Chilean Patagonia and its deficiencies are traceable to the need to include more species."
3,A few new views...but,"--After seeing some good reviews about this book, I bought it and tried reading it.Honestly I couldn't read it completely. A few chapters are good, others just worth a skim.David tries to build a 'Theory of everything' using four strands.Quantum Physics, Epistemology, Theory of Computation and Theory of Evolution.The beginning chapters are a good reading about the fundamental nature of the physical world, and how it's reality is so different from our intutive understanding of it.The Chapter titled 'Shadows' is particularly interesting.The other topics covered are quite interesting but not necessarily new.The text could have been a lot smaller and more to the point.Don't know if reading this book gives you a feeling of having learned something .Note: The 3 stars is for the few interesting topics."
1,FABRIC OF WHAT?,"Deutsch is incomprehensible and unreadable. This is a mixture of Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy and wild speculation, but modern physics it ain't. 390 pages of profound bulls***!"
2,NOT FOR ME,ENDLESS EXACT DETAIL ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT KNOWN TO EXIST.I TRIED REALLY HARD TO STAY INTERESTED BUT HAD TO GIVE UP. READSOME PAGES BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ONE. I AM GOING BACK TO FEYNMAN.
1,A great book to put you to sleep.,"This book and the author can be best summarized by the following excerpt from the Mundaka Upanishad. Part I, 3,4,5. ""What is that by knowing which all is known? He replied: ""The illumined sages say Knowledge is twofold, higher and lower. The study of the Vedas, linguistics, rituals, astronomy, and all the arts can be called lower knowledge. The higher is that which leads to Self-realization"""
2,Nothing to write home about...,"A lot of conjectures -- when not sheer, whimsical speculations -- interesting as far as quantum physics are concerned, but totally unconvincing when Deutsch touches the world of mathematics...Invoking Popper, Turing and Dawkins at each corner does not save the theory !"
5,Carbide cutters,Great product with a long life. A must for any serious dremel tool user. I highly recommend this product for all folks who use this tool.
1,Junk,"Bought at Walgreens. After using it twice, no amount of shaking will get it off of 102 degrees. A complete waste of time and money. Avoid."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,"It deserves no stars. It simply does not work. You shake it down. Place it in your mouth and it goes up to the same temperature, 98 degrees, no matter who uses it. I bought it to manage my low thyroid. It is worthless. It was packaged nicely upon receipt and I have not damaged it. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
4,The Duke Rocks!,This movie is a must for true Duke fans. Very entertaining and fun for the whole family! Also brings out the true patriot in all of us.
3,Hey Vern!,"I chose this rating because it was supposed to be a gift for my brother and my father to watch for Christmas, they didn't enjoy it as much as I thought they would. My brother said it was dumb and asked me not to get anymore of these Hey Vern movies for him."
3,kitchen dinning ware,i got one set of these because i needded somthing to eat on an off of this dinninerware is awsome thank you amazon
4,Finallly I bought Corelle,"I was never attracted to Corelle. However, after my last set of Pfaltzgraff I decided to make the switch. Pfaltzgraff chipped, scratched, heavy and bulky. Not Corelle. These dishes are great for every day. They don't chip, are lightweight and leave plenty of room in your cabinet and dishwasher. The mugs are a little bit bulky but for the price this set is fine.The blue is just as pictured and will go well with my Nordic style."
3,Ok,"This set is ok, obvious use is ok but beware it does break and when it does it shatters horribly into a million pieces."
2,EMERGENCY USE ONLY!,I bought this item to replace a dinnerware set that I had bought 20 years ago. It was made by Tienshan Stoneware. This new set is made to the minimum thickness possible. The bowel is too small to hold soup from a can. You can put this bowl inside of the bowel of my old set. For the moment this item is for emergency use only.
4,Oldie But A Goodie,"The Last Man on Earth is a Twilight Zone-like horror movie about the sole survivor of a mysterious plague that has turned the remaining population into living dead. Bob Morgan (Vincent Price) lives in his home, which he has turned into a fortress against the vampire-like undead. Having lost his wife and daughter, he is on a crusade to search the city and kill all the creatures by day.The story and cinematography is well-paced. The eerie silence of the present is punctuated by flashbacks of happier times. The flashbacks also explain what happened during the early stages of the outbreak.Recommended. DVD has no subtitles, English or otherwise, or dubbing available."
4,"A Look at the Life, Though and Works of Kobo Daishi Kukai","There has perhaps been no other more influential force in Japanese religious and societal beliefs than Kobo Daishi Kukai. This book tells the life of this colorful saint of the Japanese people, and presents an explanation of his thoughts and teachings. Here, the major religious writings of Kukai are translated, allowing the reader to glimpse at the depths of Japanese esoteric thought."
2,Not worth my time,"I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters were not engaging or even enjoyable. The ""messages"" were extremely repetitive and very cliche. The mystery was so lame and the romance was flat because of the the flat characters. It was a waste of my time."
3,interesting,Historically this is very very 60's in a very kitschy and endearing way. Not anything more unfortunately
5,Great Little Unit,Bought this unit for my wife to use at work. She burned some CD compilations to play on it and she also uses the radio and it has worked flawlessly. Excellent buy.
4,Tsugaru Shamisen the way it's supposed to be,"*THIS* album defines tsugaru shamisen. If someone asks you about Japanese music and mentions the shamisen, give them this album, especially the track Kodo (and the remixed track). They capture the essence and vibrancy of tsugaru shamisen and take it to a modern level. They are great shamisen players in their own right, but the modern twist adds a great flavor to a Japanese (excuse me, Ainu or Tsugaru) musical style."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DOLL; SHE WILL STOP WORKING,My mother bought this for my daughter for her birthday. The eyes stopped moving the next day and so did the mouth. We went to ToysRUs to exchange it. The second one broke the next day in the same exact way. My daughter who is 6 years old was totally devastated. She cried and cried. She was heartbroken. This doll has some kind of defect and should be recalled. I hope all of you reading this will NOT buy this doll for your sweet little girl. It broke my heart to see my daughter so sad.
5,Definately vault worthy,"Yes...it is costly, but you get what you pay for. The mix could be refined just a touch, but hey...it's a live recording. A very strong showing from Chic, John and Vinnie...very little stepping on each other toes in the soloing, though it seems that John won't let Chic vamp on his phrasings...but that could just be a joke between them. All in all...if you are fan of any of the three or all...you will be very happy to have this baby in your private collection."
1,Nothing New,"The information is this book has no realistic value as far as trading is concerned. It just completes Mr. Bernstein's Book a Month Club objectives. It's unfortunate he doesn't write fewer books with more content rather than a multitude of books with no content. This book adds nothing to the realm of trading and research, expecially nothing worthwhile and applicable to day trading. It's merely exploitive of those interested in day trading. His seminar companion's (Larry Williams) book is much more valuable to trtaders."
5,Forbes article specious,"Due to the erroneous and inaccurate information the author Green has brought legal action against his publication. Some of his remarks are not only undocumented, they are outright false. I have had opportunity to correspond with Jake on this issue and on several other occasions for a variety of reasons. I will say this about him; he is a fair and honest person with the best of intentions. This is evidenced in each of his books in how he strives to prepare the reader for the worst and help lead him or her to profitability. In this book are methods that will stand alone and some that I use with other methods that increase their accuracy to almost %80. Most of you reading this will lose money in all likelyhood. However, this book will help those who are willing to be patient and learn to actually come out ahead in day trading, a rarity indeed. Jake is not able to comment on any particulars of the matter of the Forbes article as it is in the hands of attorneys."
2,Reads like a PhD thesis,"A complicated book....reads more like a PhD thesis. He does make some specific predictions, however.I think someone who is a student of cycles and already has substantial knowledge may have an interest in this book.It is small paperback book of 126 pages, and again seems very academic. Probably too academic. My two stars is based that I didn't feel this book was useful for even sophisticated investors except for those with a strong backround in cycles. I did not read his previous book which perhaps provide an important backround for this book. I was attracted to buy the book because of the title."
3,Great points but almost impossible to read in parts,"The author, Michael Alexander, is surely a genius. He has an exceptional capacity of intellect and attempted in this book to decipher the market's future and how to invest in it. He was mainly correct and one cannot argue with that. His presentation and communication were not good in my view. That is why I think it earned a mixed review."
2,Disappointing,Purchased the book in anticipation that it would match the preceding two... Unfortunately I was disappointed. Particularly with the published date (2005) being 2+ years on from most data referred to within (2002)...
5,Avanti Leather Case for Motorola RAZR V3,"I had purchased a body glove case for my phone prior to buying this one, which was significantly cheaper. Although I am a big fan of body glove products, I found this case to be somewhat better. The overall design and feel of this case was better than that of the body glove case in my opinion."
1,Poor Product,The case is of poor quality. It is almost impossible to see the screen with the cover on. You have to press a button to activate the backlight - a waste of battery. The stitching is of uneven quality and seams are coming apart in just 10 days. I am returning this product.
1,Trite,"While Dirk Vandewalle draws extensively from North's scholarly masterpiece on institutional development, his own work fails to break new ground on a provocative subject. Very disappointing."
5,Great Product,Item has been working and seller sends item out immediately.After surgery dog couldn't stand or walk but with the help of this pill my dog is better and with a harness seems to be getting better.Loves it mixed with peanut butter!
3,Lovers After All was the sleeper hit on this LP,I bought this on vinyl. An ex-roommate threw my old records away! Manchester's duet with Peabo Bryson was my only reason for getting it. WHUR radio in DC used to play the song as part of its' quiet storm music mix. Maybe I will get a used CD to replace the long gone record.
4,create a relaxing atmosphere,"I purchased this item as a gift for my girlfriend to help her ease into sleep at night. The lamp is truly unique and glows a beautiful, deep orange. The base is made of solid wood, and the unit has a significant weight to it (6 - 8 lbs). Regardless of the ability of this lamp to emit ""positive ions"", I am convinced that the lamp can, in the very least, offer a relaxing atmosphere. My girlfriend can confirm that this item is a wonderful addition to her bedroom."
3,Awesome Rock Salt Lamp,This is an interesting all-natural product deep from the bowels of the earth. The light source inside makes this rock salt glow beautifully. It is a very nice touch in any room.
1,Shoddy Construction,"This lamp is put together terribly, the wires were loose at the bottom connector and the bulb burnt out after a week, very cheaply made."
2,Every quote that deals with religion or secular belief.,"This book is not advertised as religious, but it should be. The quotes in it all deal with religion, whether they are quotes out of the bible (which there aren't many) or are from persons that have great or little influence in the religious sect. If you like religion, you'll like this book."
4,Orienteering,This compass is very excellent choice to teach orienteering to young people. The orange color allows it to be more easily seen if dropped on the forest or desert floors.
3,Funny but nothing new.,"Enjoyed the book but the laughs of the book are really nothing that hasn't been expressed before thru comedy. Regardless, I enjoyed the book. If you wanna laugh, go for it. Short read too. Couple hours easy."
3,Funny but true!!!,"From the first Chapter I totally could relate to what she was writing about. It felt good to be able to laugh at myself, but more importantly to think that I am not the only one growing older thinking these same thoughts."
5,Robson Green FAN-atic,"Robson embellishes any movie he is in, regardless of the quality of the rest of it. I love having him to myself in TOUCHING EVIL, and WIRE IN THE BLOOD series. As another reviewer stated, he has perfected the role, ([bleeding heart psychiatrist]), who seems less afraid, but rather enchanted, with the illnesses of his patients. He empathizes with how they got the way they are instead of despising them for how they evolved from their molding circumstances. Without condescention, he faces the bad (the killer), and the good (the police and innocent victims), without judging either. That could make him appear apathetic, or stoic, but doesn't because of the way he has a grip on the role he plays (compassionate!). I have all of the captioned above and hope the rumors aren't true that this is the last of WIRE....But if it is, I'll be looking forward to whatever he does next!"
4,Good Intro to Compilers,"This is a fantastic book because Louden gives the theory behind how compilers and programming languages work, and then implements the theory with a simple programming language written for this book. This book, however, will take you some time and much study to complete."
2,And What the Bleep Do you Know????,"How do you know Ramtha is true? There is proof that Jesus of Nazareth was crucified by the Romans. But there is no proof of the physical existence of Lemuria. Ditto for Atlantis. Why did JZ Knight sue a woman in Germany for channelling her Ramtha so she could have exclusive rights to bring him forth? If Ramtha is such a great guide how come he couldn't prevent JZ Knight's four failed marriages??????Is Christianity a deception? If so, how come Ramtha is not? Jesus died on the cross. Ramtha ascended into the ether after a long life. Why should we believe Ramtha whose sole messenger is a woman of interesting reputation? After 2000 years much mystery is still there on Jesus of Nazareth.The truth is: By their fruits you shall know them. What fruits has JZ Knight borne? What good has come of Ramtha?"
3,They do what is intended,These gels do what they are intended to do.I am using 150 watt par cans and though the colors show up ok when I am using them a more powerful PAR can would make the color show up better.I am satisfied with what they do and my broadcasts and performances just generally work better.
2,rainbow of nothing,wasn't happy. couldn't get much backlight color to show up. waste of money. not shipped in sturdy packaging so sheets came bent all to H E double hockey sticks.
2,THIS IS NOT A CD TO BRAG ABOUT,"I HAVE MANY RAY ANTHONY CDS. THIS IS PERHAPS NOT ONE OF HIS GREATEST PERFORMANCES. IT SEEMS THAT HE USED GOOD ARRANGERS, BUT SOME OF THE SONGS WERE NOT HOUSEHOLD NAMES AND ON THE OTHRS IT SEEMS THAT THE ARRANGEMENT DIDN'T WORK. OUT OF THE 14 TRACKS LISTED I LIKED ONLY 6 SONGS."
2,"Fun, though intensely stupid movie.","I love movies where, even though the girl's spent the movie trying to kill the hero, he just keeps going back to her because, well, she's just too damn hot. This is one of those.Angelina Jolie, who did this after winning an Oscar, gets to show off her bee-stung lips and hot body, even when she's on death row confessing the story, told in flashback, to a priest.There's no redeeming story, there's no real point. The film, which shows she and Antonio Banderas getting it on about 14 different times, is just really good looking trash.I laughed my head off."
2,Original Sin,"I watched this movie because it seemed to be the best choice of what was available on movie day. Well, that, and it had Angelina Jolie. Oh yeah, I'm all about some gratuitous Angelina Jolie nudity.It turned out to be a bit better than the soft porn I had expected, with a storyline and everything. Although some called the ending predictable, I didn't see it coming; although there were parts of the plot I saw from an hour away.I'll give it 2 stars simply for the aforementioned nude Jolie- but that's as far as she gets it."
3,A WINNER,ORIGINAL SIN IS A WINNER. THE FILM GOES AS THE EXPECTATIONS. THANKS TO THE SEXY SENCES WHICH ARE VERY EXCITING. A GOOD MOVIE WITH AN INTRUSTING PLOT.PERFORMENCE WISEANTONIO IS EXCELENT.JOLIE LOOKS HOT THAT IT.BUY IT. FOR THE SEX SENCES.
2,depressing and meaningless,"the only good point about this movie is the physical beauty of the main actors. there were some steamy love scenes between Jolie and Banderas but other than that the movie is full of unnecessary violence, nudity, and sex. As a love story, the movie doesn't deliver until the final 5 minutes, but overall the movie's simply too slow. The plot, scenery, and acting in itself might deserve more than 2 stars, but coming from two fine actors this movie is simply a disappointment."
3,Angelina and Banderas. How on earth can you concentrate?,"You never really can if you are watching these two. Banderas is one of those guys who are not really upto it as far as their acting skills are concerned but his earnestness keeps this one going. Angelina has really declined as an actor since Gia and Girl Interrupted but soared as a Star inspite of some real 'turkeys'.The plot as i know has been taken from a novel that not many people bothered reading. The story is ok (as i said i wasn't exactly concentrating) and the only thing i remember about this movie is the Kama Sutra type poses by the lead pair. Hollywood will really need to do something about what it churns out.The plot, the performances and the direction are really nothing to write home about. If you are having one of those evenings when you are feeling lazy to do anything and would wish Angelina was in bed with you, then go for it and freeze the Kama sutra poses."
4,Original,"This is a very decent movie, Both actors involved, Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie, are extremely talented....some scenes might be disturbing..."
2,Original Sin,"Movie has one or two steamy scenes with two great actors, but i didnt really care for the story. I would rate this movie as one thumb up."
4,very hot and a solid film in general. the critics are wrong again,I really liked this film the story has a lot of twist and turns but it's a very sexy movie I really liked the script and their are some flaws believe me but for the most part I would recomend this to any fan of the actors/actresses of this film.
3,The story line about the power of love,The story start from Mr. Vargas (antonio Banderas) picks his couple at the harbor. He is event don't know who's his couple because he only has a photo and letter form his couple. He found miss Russell but not same with the photo he has. That's the story start. The rest is showing their wedding ceremony and their romantic life with his wife (Miss Russell). But he only have a short romantic live because miss Russell just want his money and leave her husband after she has that money. In this case she is using others person to run her plan.The rest of it is Mr. Vargas try to find his wife to find his money and to know exactly who is she. But because Mr. Vargas so much in love with his wife he is do everything to make his wife back event his life.The story good for week end show and the sex scene quit romantic. One sex scene ant the beginning so beautiful
5,Essays Of E. B. White,I'm pretty sure I've done this one before.I'm very happy to have received such an excellent copy of this fine book! I received it in short order and well-packaged. My thanks to the seller.
4,Like Butter...,I used this blade to cut some flat quartz stones to put around the perimeter of a small pond. It worked great and after about an hours worth of grinding I didn't notice much wear.
3,"Cute, but leaky","I've now worn this ring twice. The first wearing it was all ""snow-globey"", but after about 3 hours of wearing it the second time, all the liquid leaked out. It's cute & cheap so I'll buy another one, but beware: it's faulty."
3,Very Old performances,"Redneck Comedy Roundup - I feel was misleading. It is interesting to see these men (Foxworthy, Engvall & White) in their early careers, individually."
5,Kryptinite,This C.D. is awsome! Me and my friends just can't stop listening to it! Our favorite song is Kryptinite. I take it to all of the parties that I go to and it's the first song that's requested to be played. Everyone should buy this C.D. or at least listen to it!
3,Would You Believe?,"Here's a copy of the e-mail you sent to Merrow Global Stores:Order Number: 002-1739697, CUSTOMER P.O. NO. 002-17393697, Packig Slip Number: 365843, Order Date: 02-15-10, Ship Date: 02-15-10, ITEM NUMBER: DR90826, CARBONE BRUSHES FOR 260. _______Problem: Only One Carbone Brush was included in the package. The description lists 'Brushes'. I need two Brushes total, please. Please ship the other one Brush DR90826. Thank you."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought two of these a few weeks ago. Neither of them will hold air, and they have been that way since day one. Both are now in the trash can."
3,Not In the Groove,"Many of Ray Anthony's big band recordings, including this CD, don't really hit the groove. This cd contains a number of arrangements that were part of the Count Basie book.It's reasonably enjoyable to listen to and there is a fine array of studio musicians doing this album but emotionally it didn't do a thing for me. If you like big band that's not offensive, this would be a good one."
1,I Love Spider Films...,"I just love spider, arachnoid, insect, venemous bug films. I love them so much I watch every one I can get my eight legs on...until this one. Don't get lured into this web. The storyline is as pitiful as the special effects. 90% of the spiders are of the plastic kind hanging from strings. There are more screams than script (duh), and there's nothing about this film that makes your skin crawl. It just bugs you (no pun intended). What really makes this a phony film are the theatrical spider webs. They are 20 times larger than the humans, yet everyone can crawl on them without getting stuck like a sojourn on a hammock. This one is avoidable. Nothing about it is good. If you really want to see a great spider flick, don't miss ""Arachnoid""."
5,Best Ever!,"This screen house is by far the best I have ever used. The tent is made very well, with good seams, heavy duty material, light but sturdy polls, easy to setup, good zippers... Can't say enough about this tent! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Way bulkier/heavier than expected,"It gets the job done, but it is quite large and bulky and is difficult for one person to set up. The snap-in floor just provides some ground covering and in no way prevents insects from entering the screen room. Unless you really need to cover a picnic table, I would recommend going with a largish regular tent like REI's hobbitat."
4,Great Screen Tent,"Great Screen Tent, I like the double entry exit feature and roll up privacy flaps/awnings. Zippers are good, usually one handed but on occasion will catch the cover. On the down side the roof seams need some kind of seam seal/silicone treatment as it did weep, not leak, water during a hard rain. One might want longer tent stakes too."
2,retro radio,This radio is awesome looking. That's it. It can run on either a cord or several AA batteries. It has a lot of static and I would not recommend it.
2,2 years and now it's a paper weight,"I bought this TV 2 years ago as a gift for my husband. I was really excited as this was our first big-screen TV. When it was set up and ready to go I was not overwhelmed by the picture but could live with that. Fast forward to now (only 2 years later) and now the set spontaneously turns off after about 5 minutes; first the screen goes black and then the sound dies 10 seconds later. After googling this issue I find it's quite a common one and many people are having customer service nightmares trying to get this resolved. There is even a class-action lawsuit against Samsung because of this. I have a 10 year old 32"" Panasonic that hasn't had a single problem at all. Shame on you, Samsung. For supposedly being a leader in TV technology you should've build a TV that lasts longer than a mere 2 years and stand behind it!"
2,DLP bulb blew in three weeks!,"When it's working it's wonderful! However, after three short weeks, the bulb blew and now we are going to be two weeks without a television waiting for the repair. It's nice to have replacement, but who is going to pay for the loss of use and satellite fees in the interim!?"
1,Samsung support is horrible.,"Bought a Samsung 50 inch DLP about six months ago. When we got it home we couldn't get it to stay on, so the store sent over someone to replace the bulb. Unfortunately the store support ended after 90 days. Then...Samsung was supposed to take over. Fast forward five months ""today."" The TV started shutting off after five mins of playing. Called Samsung, unfortunately we moved and didn't have the receipt. A call from the store didn't help Samsung understand that the TV is still covered. Our six month old $1699 TV, is now going to cost us $717 to fix. Thanks Samsung...from a guy who bought two laptops and two TVs and a microwave from you...never again."
4,GOOD BUY,"In HD format as good as any. Loaded with extras.Place it at waist level and enjoy a great HD picture.The weaknesses are two... 1. Analog signals are not asgood as digital 2. Viewing from a level higher than thescreen is poor.The strengths are many, such as price, size, many inputs,many outputs, and lots of controls over picture and sound.Great Buy for the money."
5,lint wizard,I love the lint wizard. I actually wore my first one out and I'm going to purchase another one. I have two animals that shred and I use the lint wizard on a daily basis.
1,never received product,"was told to ""contact the post office"" when I inquired as to why I never received the item."
5,LONG AWAITED RELEASE!,"I've been so tempted to purchase Sam Peckinpah's DEADLY COMPANIONS from overseas (Region 2) as both the UK and Germany releases offer widescreen prints of this Western. Here in the US all we've ever gotten is the chopped-up, faded, blurry pan and scan version offered by dozens of cheap public domain companies. Seeing this film newly restored and in a widescreen presentation from VCI will be like seeing it for the first time. I, for one, can hardly wait."
1,You'll want to punch the TV screen,"You want to punch the characters. It feels like it was written by someone that hates women because both women are selfish, clueless, lazy sluts. They even throw in the sleezy salesman to really paint the ""screw you! you actually sat through this movie!"" I didn't even pay for it. I feel really sorry for the people that did. The ending is pretty obvious and there are a lot of plotholes (like the missing cats). If anything, Peter the Dad was a redeeming character, but he doesn't even get the happy ending he deserves which makes someone hate the movie even more."
2,The Other Woman,"In this film Lisa Kudrow was the star! This was the most believable role in the movie. Every aspect of this role was portrayed truly real -- or how should she have acted being replaced by a still younger and really not so admiring person (Portman)? Her change for a moment toward the end when she tries to help Portman is again a wonderful demonstration of her capacity to portray emotion and understanding in spite of being dumped. We should see more of Kudrow in many more movies ..Portman played, as she did in Black Swan, the perverbial helpless soul, despite personal issues, wanting to please all and suffering throughout. The role portrayed a youngish and immature female ...we have 2011 -- are women still doing that? Whoops.. Cohen's best line was at the end telling her it's too late to fix it...Natalie Portman should be allowed stronger roles... ""V"" was still her best to date"
2,Disappointed,Was looking for something deferent than what I saw. This was truly a mismatch of story line and results. I've been following her career with great antcipation of watching her grow into maturity. This was not a better step.
4,You get what you pay for . . .,"The Stanley plane is about half the cost of an excellent plane. Unlike a ready to use high-price plane, the Stanley needs tuning. I filed and ground the sole flat as it was concaved along the length. A few strokes with a small file to clean up the throat, and then one needs to sharpen the plane iron. A few hours later the Stanley is ready to go!"
2,YOU MUST KNOW THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THE BOOK!,The book requires an instructor's manual for the answers and translations. You will have to go to the publisher to download the free 130 page manual: [...]. Can't review the book yet because I just started.
1,Terrible,I decided to use the carbide grinding stone to help remove spurs from wood i was working on. The actual carbide grinding stone separated from the metal piece 3 times no matter how deep i had the bit set into the dremel. The company dremel was great about sending replacements at no cost however i was not expecting to have such an issue with the piece separating. Maybe they should make the whole piece out of the carbide or i should stick with using it for only etching glass etc.
5,Great American Novel,This is a book I've read many times over the years. Both in paperback and now kindle version. It's easy to take for granted the life of today without thinking of the great people we'll never learn about in history books that built this country. While this book is obviously fiction it helps you see the kind of people it took to tame the land from coast to coast. More importantly the sacrifices and in many case the destruction of entire families moving into completely wild and unknown lands. This is a book that should be required reading for everyone interested in American history.
2,Bit Too Kitschy,"Although a fun ""islander"" Christmas album, the Hawaiian experiment gets pretty old quite fast. Only for the really dedicated Lyman fans"
1,Relieved it isn't just me,"I have used this product on and off for years. When Costco started to carry it, I started to use it again. My thick, fairly course hair has felt dry ever since. No matter how long I leave it on, my hair doesn't feel conditioned. I am so glad that I read these reviews, as I had been blaming the change in my hair on the weather, hormones, styling laziness, and a poor selection of styling products. I had such faith in the product, it hadn't dawned on me that Nexxus had cheapened up its product.As for the new smell, it doesn't really bother me and I am fairly sensitive to perfumes. It is more perfumey than the old scent, but it wouldn't stop me from using the product."
1,Very disappointed,"Old Formula was the best. The new formula doesn't smell good and leaves my hair slightly dry and brittle. Old formula left it soft and moist. I have used the old formula for several years. After all those years, I will now have to go shopping for what else is out there. This new formula is as good as the best formulas that were out there several years ago. It is now a pale comparison of what it used to be. I am still in shock over the change of something so good to something mediocre."
1,Rape is not romance.,"I have to agree with a number of the reviews I read after I bought The Burning. The initial story line was a good idea, but there is no romance in reading about the main character, Stephan, being raped over and over again by the Daughters. Rape is not sexy no matter what gender is the victim. I only finished the book because I was hoping it would end better than it started. This is not romance. If you want good romance with a paranormal twist read Sherrilyn Kenyon or Christine Feehan. Those two know romance."
1,The Worst Vampire Romance Novel Ever!!! A Complete Waste of Time!!!,"The first time I heard/saw this novel, it was through a book trailer. It seemed very good and interesting, so obviously, I bought it. When I started to read this 'novel' it was fairly good so far, until you get to the dominatrix scene of three vampire women, especially a little history of a retarded love triangle. I couldn't continue reading cause it lacked a sense of taste for being a vampire romance novel. Also, what really got to me was the amount of details this novel had, too much details is a turn off for me. So obviously in my opinion, don't even think of buying this book, it's a complete waste of time and trust me, you'll be wanting that complete waste of time of your life back."
3,Overpriced for sure!,"They work, and they're easy to setup with the downloadable Avery templates, but like every other Avery product, they're overpriced. Unfortunately, there really is no other alternative out there, unless of course you have equipment that will print on these:Avery Copier Tab Dividers, Unpunched, 5 Tab, White, 30 Sets (20405). Luckily, I do have equipment that will print on those, and have since started using them."
1,Used for 2 semesters of Spanish in College,"This book is disorganized and poorly written. Often leaving the easiest lessons for the last chapters. Every teacher I spoke to disliked using this book. In fact, it has caused so much negative controversary that the school system has now switched to a new book-forcing me to use mine as fireplace wood."
2,Eh..,"I was looking to save some money when I bought this bra. I normally buy Wacoal minimizers but was short on cash so I got this one instead. I measured my exactg size, and it fit fine when it came but honestly, it didnt minimize anything. A friend commented the first night I wore it that my breasts looked really big tonight. Not what I wanted to hear while wearing a brand spanking new minimizer bra. She was right, they lifted everything up really well, but as for minimizing...nada. I'll stick with Wacoal, they are expensive, but sooooo worth it."
3,"Great Standing, Painful and Weird looking when Sitting..","When I first put this bra on and then my shirt over it, I was ecstatic that it made my boobs look like they looked in high school: high and perky and alot smaller than they are now! However, when I sat down, the middle of the bra pushed up and out giving my shirt a weird lump between my breasts. The wires are also very uncomfortable and I couldn't wait to rip the thing off! Will be sending back unfortunately :/"
2,It's ok.,"I wanted a more comfy bra for daily wear, this rubs and chafes where an under wire would usually go.Pretty uncomfortable at at the end of the day. It does hod everything in place, though, pretty firm support."
5,Excellent,"I have been buying this bra through Barenecessities DOT com for quite some time and now will buy via Amazon DOT com, and it's a very high quality bra. It's quite expensive in the stores and even online (prices vary), but it's typically a well made garment. I've only had to return one once in probably 15 years of wearing buying this bra. I recommend hand washing only. Once you start washing it in the machine, it loses its spring in my opinion. (No dryer either). The shoulders are quite comfortable, and the fasteners have never broken. The underwire can be a little uncomfortable, but I think that is the nature of this type of bra. The wires just aren't comfy if you have big b**bs. Most of the time I don't notice them. But overall the bra really gives you a lot of support and does minimize, and not in a ""pointy"" way. I prefer the black color best, as the white dulls quickly and the ""pink"" or ""rose"" color is not that pretty."
5,Love this bra!,"Like most women, I have tried a lot of bras...the Satin Tracings minimizer is the best one I have come across, and the only one I buy now! It provides FULL coverage and a lot of support."
1,bali womens satin tracer minimizer bra,did not meet my requirements. cant compare to edith lances minimizer.i cant use it.
3,Great bra except when sitting down!,"I absolutely loved this bra when trying it on and when walking around. It fit great and held me perfect. Then I wore it sitting down and that's when the problems started. I have major fat rolls on my belly which cause the underwire to be pushed up when I'm sitting, which causes the underwire that's between my breasts to push out ""farther"" than my breasts making it look like I have some weird hard lump in beween my breasts. It's definitely not a comfortable bra when sitting down which is what I do the majority of the time. This is a great bra for people who don't have stomach fat rolls or if you're going to be standing up all the time. Otherwise, I'd advise you to look for something where the underwire doesn't go so high on the chest."
5,Best bra for the overendowed,I've been wearing this bra for at least 15 years. The four hooks on the broad back band give great support and keep the bra down in back; the underwire gives good separation; the broad straps prevent ridges in the shoulder. It is as comfortable as a DD bra can get. Quick delivery made all this into a very satisfactory purchase.
3,Disappointed,"Ashworth's ""Winter Garden"" is on my keeper shelf, so I guess I must admit that I expected something similar from this book. I didn't get anything close. SPOILERS follow: The author lost me at Chapter 1 when it is revealed that Mimi married Carter Sinclair. If the Prologue hadn't set up the electric attraction between Mimi and Nathan first, I would have been indifferent to the fact that she had been married already. But to establish how much Mimi wanted Nathan, then to have her go and marry someone else (because her father wanted her to!) was a huge letdown from which my interest could not recover. The book was well written style-wise, but a romantic disappointment."
2,Don't Waste Your Time.,"This bleak book is filled with too many self-important people espousing a depressingly shallow view of life and death. Only some of the very ""simple"" and ""uneducated"" of those interviewed showed any real depth of faith and understanding of the Scriptural promises of life after death. Many of the characters are ""cultured despisers"" of the Christian message and ""organized"" religion. This book has so little to offer the reader, I'm embarrassed to even list it for sale on Amazon."
1,Wonder why and how ?,"Found this as the only system that has Casettes, CDs and MP3 playing capability, all in one. Ordered it and got it after three long weeks. When I unpacked and played the CD it said ""Reading Disk1"". It went on for minutes and hours. I found that all the buttons are stuck including the power button and I have to unplug to get it working again. CDs never played after repeated tries. A brand new system out of the box !! Couldn't believe RCA did not test the simple function of the ...system before distributing to the market..."
1,I hate this thing.,"Might be an okay system, but I can't get the cd player to work. Every time I try, the digital readout displays ""reading"" and stays that way. All the input buttons, including the power button lock up and I have to unplug the system to get it to start again. I wish I had never bought it."
4,a great book on data structures,"This is a great book because it describes the fundamental data structures in plain english, in pseudocode and in c++. In addition, it contains great explanation of algorithm efficiency, and the analogy that is made of walls and mirrors to data abstraction and recursion helps you understand both concepts better. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had pseudocode (or c++ code) for the balancing algorithm of an AVL tree."
4,minor sticker issue. Fine otherwise,"My only problem with it is that it still has the old rental store's sticker on it, claiming that it is a rental. I wish they had removed that, but otherwise it came in in the description provided."
1,Wasted money,"Don't be confused by the 5 star reviews. This book is horrible and can only be trumped by the 5th edition of the same title (sadly I know first hand).It is particularly funny that reviewers state there are great coding examples contained in this book. Are there really? Did you actually read the same book I am trying to read? Perhaps they are confusing the totally worthless pseudo-code with code examples.If you are used to learning from other computer books that:1. Summarize the topic of a section/chapter.2. Show you a WORKING, compilable code example.3. Then go into greater detail about the functionality.This book is NOT for you.But please, don't take my word for it. Search out the name Frank Carrano on Amazon and look at the 1 Star reviews of other books he has pushed on the college education system. If you are thinking of taking this as a college course and have less than 2 years C++ programming, DON'T TAKE THE COURSE."
2,Good singing - but awful tired production,"A star line up of some of the greatest russian singers in todays times. Musically the orchestra under maestro Gergiev flourished. The picture and sound quality of this DVD was again flawless. Where is the problem? We are told on the sleave that this was the Kirov's magnificent 1998 production, and being aware of what Kirov productions are like I was prepared for some semi-tradititonal staging. What I saw though was a production that resembled something that would be considered old fashioned in the nineteeth century. Tired painted backcloths and bulky clumsy costumes, in some cases ridiculous make up more fit for the circus than on the stage (The Khan for one example). I wonder if those at the cash strapped Kirov had got together and in an attempt at saving money had collected items and props from all their old productions mixed them together and called it a new production."
5,Sweet Sizzler,"As hot as Private Lessons is, and, boy, is it hot, I enjoyed it equally for the characters and the storyline. Julie Elizabeth Leto's books have at their center a lot of emotion and heart. Grant and Harley belong together, their intimate love scene requires a fire extinguisher, and this book demands a spot on my keeper shelf."
1,So Very Disappointed,"I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself.Examples of what I mean: some of the ""bad girl"" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, ""bad for a good reason"" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl!"
5,Speechless,"What can I say abut this? This has to be the most comprehensive guide to an RPG world I have ever read. It reads like a history text and encyclopedia combined, but not as dry. The writers at Privateer Press have outdone themselves. Background info is given on the wonderful world of the Iron Kingdoms that they have shared with us. They go into such detail int he book. Each country's entry gives info that I wish other publishers put into their publications, such as the hierarchy of nobility and titles used. They even go as far to devote a section to ships used int he Iron Kingdoms and describe them.There is so much information here, most GMs will find it daunting to know where to start with what they have before them. But between this and the IK World Guide Vol 1, these stand out as the best written RPG products to come along in a long time.If you have any passing interest in the Iron Kingdoms, and even if you don't, this and the ocmpanion Vol. 1 book are highly recommended!"
5,For common garments!,"A great place to start if you're looking for the medieval common clothes patterns and sewing techniques.It's not riddled with complicated notions and covers a lot of items, from underwear's to capes and hair net's creation guidelines.A lot of useful sketches and drawings come to add value to the... unisex patterns (I mean there's always only one pattern from which both men's and women's clothes can be created).I'd recommend it to all interested in making their own medieval garments."
4,Fabulous for the intermediate,This book is very exciting! It tells you anything and everything that you might need to know about doing Anglo Saxon dress from about 900 up to about the 1500's. Using one basic 'bodice block' that is easy to make with two people you can make just about anything in the book. Might take a bit longer for beginners to catch on but a highly recommended book for those that are seriously into period costuming.
3,reasonable,"After reading reviews I thought this would be an ideal reference and utility. I wasn't as impressed with content. It is still a good book, but I was hoping for a greater number of ideas and breadth of coverage."
3,eh..,"not a great product, doesn't come w/ tie down loops or straps and doesn't fit the back of the seat well."
3,Not enough detail after too many wasted pages,"Although I enjoyed the book, the author devotes too much space to general issues (like different types of motorcycles, engine design, etc.) which have been well covered by other books. The real meat about touring doesn't start until page 110. The 47 pages remaining are okay but lacking in detail, frequently suggesting to read other books (i.e., about camping). I wish Stermer had done this for the first 110 pages and expanded the rest."
2,I must have got a bad copy,"The DVD I got with this title (Practical Hapkido vol I) was not what I anticipated . Let me explain I've a few other DVDs ie...the Sexton ones , Bong Soo Han's stuff and Jong Bae Rim\Joe Sheya's videos and this one is not in the same league . I was in a word .....Disappointed , with both vol I&II sorry but that's just me . I should have written this sooner after my purchase but I got overcome by events . Not looking to slam any one just calling it as I see it."
5,The Perfect Companion for Transcendental Meditation,"Sacred Science is an important book, making advanced knowledge of Kriya Pranayama (yogic breath control) available to the public for the first time. Not only that, it provides one of the clearest discussions you will find anywhere on our spiritual origins, and what is necessary to complete the journey home.As a long time practitioner of Transcendental Meditation, I have found this knowledge to be valuable, not because TM is inadequate in any way, but because Kriya Pranayama enhances the power of the TM and TM/Sidhis program many-fold. Thank you Mr. Paulsen!"
3,Good Beginners book,"Paulsen's book has some good information for novice meditators, but the solar logos technique is very elementary. As is often the case if you want the to learn a particular skill you must go straight to the source. For learning Kriya Yoga look up the Paramahansa Yogananda's Self Realization Fellowship"
3,it's ok,i gave away a great thai book. this book does not contain a lot the recipes that i needed since i eat out at vietnamese and thai snack shops.
1,"Great music, poor audio quality","Definitely get your hands on this, but find another source. I get light years better results from an old turntable and a USB converter package, and people laugh at such backward things. This is an exceptional recording, very much worth getting your hands on, but the AMZN download is full of skips and distortion. As an AMZN fan I am very disappointed to say this, but it is what it is. Music rating: five stars. OK, ten stars. Just get it elsewhere."
4,Knowledge is better than gadgets,"Anyone with access to a computer, a decent audio interface, and simple software like GarageBand has more engineering power than what the Beatles used, so why does most DIY recording sound awful? Because the beginner doesn't know how to make their audio tracks cooperate with each other.This book gives you the basic understanding and foundation on the important aspects of music production and mixing. It's not all you'll need, but it's an awesome start.Get some knowledge and let go of that tendency to buy more irrelevant software and hardware. You probably got more than you need already to make great recordings. After all, if you don't know how to practically use the stuff you've already spent your money on, then what good is it really?"
2,Dissapointed in what it included,"My primary purpose for buying this was for the road markings. I foolishly thought it was going to come with some type of road markings I could put down on the road I had already built. Instead the 'kit' only came with two types of paint- sidewalk and road, a ruler/scraper and a 'scribe' to remove the topcoat of paint revealing the bare surface below. Had I known that was all the 'stripping' was going to include I would have been able to do that with stuff I already own."
5,RIVETING AND MOVING MOVIE ABOUT ABUSE,"This movie captures like no other that I have seen the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse, including the seductiveness of an adult abuser and the varying ways in which children try to cope with an overwhelming experience; an unbelievably riveting and powerful film, and one of the most stunning films I have ever seen; I first saw this film at the Provincetown Film Festival and have watched it many times since then--each time it is as powerful as the first viewing; an amazing film!"
5,Very disturbing but Very good,"I thought this movie was excellently done and very watchable. Excellent acting and story. But the story was very disturbing, showing the effects on kids of abuse. It really opened my eyes to the problem of child abuse. A must see for every open minded free thinking adult. Not sure if I would recommend it for teens though."
3,Neither Fish Nor Fowl,"This is a tough book to review as it tries to speak to two very different audiences -- corporate information security and law enforcement professionals.The corporate information security professionals will find the technical details misleading and over simplified but will definitely benefit from the detailed discussions of proper process and procedure.The author leverages her experience as a police officer and academy instructor to good effect in educating us on the viewpoint of the law enforcement community and the requirements we must meet in collecting and preserving admissible evidence.My advice would be to VERY lightly skim the ""technical"" material on vulnerabilities, exploits and defenses while reserving detailed reading for the material dealing with process and procedures as well as the logistics for involving and interacting with law enforcement."
3,Ok For a Refrience Book,"OK Book for a refereince book, very little in it to read as a whole. Not as good of a historic reprint as others I have. Most interesting thing to read was the amount of Lead used in the carriage paints! I didn't pay a great deal for the book and it in return isn't giving me much, guess we are even!"
2,Hard to tell what you're seeing...,I can't really see anything when I look in my son's ear - or anyone else's ear. Wouldn't buy this again. I think you need a lesson from a doctor or nurse to make this worth anything.
4,Good product,I opted for this one over more expensive ones and am satisfied with my purchase. I have no issues seeing into the ear canal and can get a clear view of the eardrum. I like that it provides pictures of healthy eardrum and other conditions. It also provided instructions on how to get a clear view of eardrum. Multi sized attachments lets me use it on my son and husband. Definitely recommend for moms who feel comfortable looking into the ear prior to making an appointment to see the doctor. Also helps with checking ears to see if there is earwax buildup that needs to be safely (I use mineral oil) removed.
5,Dr Mom Otoscope,I am a UK doctor and use this great little product for home visits. It is portable with a great light and visualisation of the typanic membrane. I use the light without the ear tips to visualise throats. I would highly recommend it for medical students and for other doctors who want to travel light for home visits.
5,great product which gives you peace,"My daughter was having ear infections frequently (at 2 months, she got the worst) and I visited the Dr's office quite often. Sometimes I went just to check whether the infection is gone after medication. Then I bought this product but I was very skeptical. It was tough to check initially but once you get the hang of it, it is so much easier. Now, whenever I suspect, I just check her ears. Make sure you clean it with an alcohol pad or use the disposable probes. It is one product which gives me peace of mind."
4,easy to use,"Good product, easy to use. But saying it's equal to the one in doctor's office is just overstatement."
1,Garbage!!!,Purchased on 30 December 2012. Just went to use it and it doesn't work. Return policy expired yesterday :( This didn't last for one month. Not to mention the tips do not stay on. When I used the scope I had to hold the tips in place with my fingers. Don't waste your money!!!!
5,Great Otoscope!,I just bought this otoscope after the one I had broke. This is a great otoscope and I highly recommend to any mom that wants to avoid unnecessary doctor visits.
4,Dr Mom Otoscope,"This product is great and should be in every home. I would suggest taking it to your Pediatrician's or PCP's office and ask for a demonstration of how to use it correctly. It is important to know which direction to gently pull the ear for optimal viewing of the ear drum and canal since the technique is slightly different for children than for adults. When used correctly, it may save you many trips to the doctor's office!"
2,Not as easy as it says,"well, product may be good but to try to use it is not very easy. I feel that you have to have some kind of professional training to know how to use it. I cant figure out anything from it."
2,toy set,"THIS REMINDS ME OF A ""LETS PLAY DOCTOR"" TOY SET ITEM. OVER PRICED. SPEND A LITTLE MORE FOR A OTOSCOPE."
4,"Not ""professional grade"" but pretty good",I got this to check my daughter's ears when she had a minor infection. It works fine and the LED light is nice - I always have or can find batteries and don't have to worry about burned out bulbs. I have used it very little since my daughter has had no more ear trouble but we do check for excess wax on occasion and she loves using it to look in our ears. It is a good value for the price.
2,It's alright,"The light isn't very bright. The magnification isn't the best. It's decent for seeing if there's an object lodged in the ear, but doesn't provide the best visualization for the tympanic membrane. I suppose for the price it's useful though."
2,Never worked,"I put the batteries in, got a little light and they went dark. I will have to return them soon."
5,Dr. Mom Otoscope -- Nice Product,"Quality otoscope for the price. Comes with three different sized specula for different sized ear canals as well as an informative brochure with pictures for what too look for to determine if there is an ear infection, perforation, healthy ear drum etc. Easy to use and good visibility through the ear canal and to the ear drum."
5,Great product,This item is great and works as described. It helps to be able to see into my kids ears without having to take them to the doctor. I highly recommend this item.
3,True Story,This is a film based on actual events in the Bosnian war. B_Movie at best. Worth while for its historical context.
2,nike watch,"the watch is beatiful but it's not so good.....on the first time that i take a shower, entered a lot of water into the watch...... and for change it it's very dificult, the policy it's very very hard.... you have to pay for everything, like if you want change the watch YOU have to pay for shipping.... if you wanna change something on the watch(because it's broken) YOU have to pay...."
1,Bleh!,These fruit snacks taste pretty bad. They are coated with a fine sugary substance than totally negates any notion you might have had about them being a healthier snack. The fruit shapes are not in any way correlated to the tase of the candies. Did I mention they taste awful?
4,excellent intro for beginning study of the Pentateuch,"As someone who teaches the Bible to Catholics in various contexts, I've found this little volume a handy guide to get people introduced to the basic issues of how to understand the Pentateuch. Fretheim explains things in a balanced, clear way without too much technical jargon (as Blenkinsopp's otherwise excellent volume tends to do) for beginners. He extracts from the mountains of scholarship just enough to keep people from being fundamentalists without overwhelming them with detail."
5,Great Movie!,"Based on the novel of La Princesse de Clèves, I found this to be an interesting interpretation. The emotions are communicated through expressions rather than words, which seems to add more to what goes on in the film between everyone at the school. At first it was a lot to take in during the introduction - I needed to watch the film a couple times before understanding it. However, this is a nice French film to see that shows a different perspective to what high school life includes.Garrel's performace in this film is terrific throughout the film. The way he displays his ""hidden"" emotions gives more to his feelings towards Junie."
1,I HATE THIS BOOK,"I spend a lot of time to read the bookbut it let me so frustration and feel like a oaf!for example the chap five, p 111this kind of book should use ready-to-run short examples totell the reader what the hell inside the computer memoeyand how the cpu begins their life whenever power-on!"
4,Flight of the Dragon Kyn,This book is great. I didn't even read the first book of this sequal and I felt like I knew the characters like my own famliy. The adventures of Kara leave you intrigued till the very last page. The story flows very well and all the events leave you wanting more.
1,Riddled with Errors and Typos,"As an accounting intructor at a technical college, I adopted this text after successful use of a previous edition. However,in my opinion, this textbook is horrible! Riddled w/ errors, typos, and omissions, SW/Thomson Learning should be embarrassed to claim it as its own. What happened to their editors? Use something else when possible!"
1,Can you be all things to all people?,"This book,part of the ""Bella by Night"" series (which means it rates high on the erotica scale), is a book of short series connected by an address: 18th and Castro. All the scenarios are different. I found some of the stories to be very good; others silly and the rest kinky.Save your money and buy one of Kallmaker's earlier romances. I recommend ""Touchwood"", ""Watermark"", ""In Every Port"", ""Wild Things"" and ""Making Up For Lost Time""."
4,Nice toy,If you are a PEANUTS fan you need to have this toy.is a nice stuff for collectors or to decorate your desk
1,Not what I was looking for.,"This bag would be fine for a smaller person in warm climates. For a 6'4"" heavy weight in the Northwest it's not enough."
1,Tabs,"While my old Honeywell lasted some 30 years with the tabs still holding.This new one has super thin plastic tab rings that broke off when access cover was removed.I guess I could tape the cover back on, my wife will love that!"
3,Very Skinny Extra,"I am a great fan of PR so I would buy this anyway. But in terms of getting your money's worth - this DVD is so sadly lacking the extra trimmings that the other 4 seasons had - no behind the scene, no reunion show!! Why?? The only bonus in the BONUS is a follow-up on winner Leanne during her Elle mag photo-shoot. The box said the DVD included extended episodes - but I didn't notice them, so it's hard to see where the cost of the DVD is justifiable.I love Tim Gunn but do not agree with Tim Gunn being the judge for the final runway show, it diminishes his impartiality and integrity as a non-bias mentor. Surely they could pull in another celebrity guest judge! Even Fern Mallies had to be better than Tim Gunn."
4,Another good season,"Season five has been called the weakest season, but it's still fun. There's not a clear winner, as there was in season four, so it's fun to see some more even competition. If you're a fan of the show, it's a must see. If you're not, start with season one and work your way up."
2,Big yawn,"My daughter and I thought this season was disappointing. Not many of the contestants were likeable, their designs weren't spectacular, and the last challenge (evening gown)was so banal that I thought the designers were going to be told to get back to the workroom and really CREATE! We DID miss the reunion show although I imagine it would have been rather catty. The ""WEAR is the Winner Now"" segment just showed her at the ELLE photo shoot and didn't give any information on what she was doing 6 months after the show. THAT'S what we find interesting - have the winners been successful in their work life?"
1,Don't waste your money !!!!!,"This book is practically useless. In order to work on the tutorials, it is necessary to download the images for the lessons from the publisher's website (as stated in the book).However, most of the images are not there !!!! I made contact with the publisher several times hoping they would correct the problem, but was unsuccessful.There are lots of other books for learning Photoshop Elements 2---keep looking !!!"
4,Good,"Okay, this item sure does what it is meant to do! My catching has gotten better by at least 4x and will now be a starting WR on my HS team. That was after only THREE days of using these.The only reason it is 4 starts is the price. It looks like it only takes about $5 to $6 to create."
4,Taylor Model 9853 Scale Fix,"If you have trouble getting the Model 9853 scale to read correctly, check the battery. If this is OK, do the following: Turn the scale over. You will see a small switch labelled 'Kg-Lb'. If you are in Lb, switch to Kg, then weigh yourself. If reading is about your correct Kg weight, switch back to Lb, and weigh yourself again. It will read about right. Step off, then on again, and it will read correctly. It will also display 'C' briefly to show it has calibrated itself. Needless to say, if you are in a metric country, start in Kg, switch to Lb. Here in the USA we still use an antique measuring system!End of story."
2,it worked for less than 2 weeks.,I had this scale for two weeks and it worked fine but all of a sudden the 0 would get stuck after stepping on the scale. When I tried to return it the shipping cost was half of what I purchased it for. Ridiculous!
3,A fairly good Poodle book,"This book is OK, as far as Poodle books go, but it is part of a large chain of dog books. This chain has a habit of using breed -related information in the first few chapters, then switching over to a generic, all-breed dog care information manual for the rest of the book. This doesn't mean that it is not a good book, but I prefer to read more specific information about the breed the book supposedly is about. One thing that I liked about this book were its colorful pictures, but I would recommend that the reader spend his or her money on a more exclusively ""Poodle"" book."
1,WANT TO LOOSE YOUR PHONE?,"VERY POOR CLIP, NO SPUR TO RETAIN CASE ON BELT. PLASTIC CLIP LOOSES CLAMPING ABILITY FAST. YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR PHONE! GET A CASE THAT HAS BELT LOOPS."
4,So far so good. Sounds great and plays all my mp3 cd's,"I've only had this mp3 cd player for a couple weeks, but so far it's worked out great. I don't have to keep changing cd's a work like with a regular cd player. It's hasn't had a problem with any of my mp3 cd's and the sound quality is great. The volume could be a little higher, but it's sufficient for work. The digital tuner is great, but it doesn't get as good of reception as my old cd player did, but now I don't care since I use the mp3 player the most.My only annoyance is the shuffle feature. It works fine, but everytime I turn it on, I have to go and turn the shuffle on. I wish it would remember that I always want shuffle. I know it's really minor, but that's the only thing wrong with it so far."
4,Good product for the price,"I purchased two of these items, one to hold my ipod the other to hold my palm phone. They both hold the ipod and phone securely, but the only downfall was the installation. Once installed, you can't adjust the directional air flow from the vents, this could also depend on the size of your vents. I installed mine on a 2002 Toyota Tacoma, which has limited space on the dash to use the adhesive alternative. Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product."
5,Old Boy Scout have to have them.,Great gift for a young boy or girl. Silva has been around all my life. I gave the Explorer 203 to a 5 year old and it opened many questions between him and the family about the science of finding ones way in life.
1,This cassette fails to fulfill even modest expectations.,"Is it reasonable to assume that a one-hour cassette tape entitled 'Elizabeth Bishop' includes poetry read by Bishop herself? Perhaps not. Surely, though, such a tape would include complete Bishop poems adequately read by someone. Guess again. The tape in question is a hodge-podge of comments by UNIDENTIFIED people about Bishop's poetry. Octavio Paz has an accent, so one can identify him, and I think the quavery, crusty voice is Mary McCarthy's -- but who knows for sure? An extremely self-conscious woman (unidentified) reads about half a dozen strangely expurgated poems. There is no indication either on the cassette case or on the tape itself that the poems have been edited. Why edit short poems anyway? You'll have to ask someone at Mystic Fire Audio."
2,Not accurate for Urine PH,"This was suppose to measure PH accurately, but it does not. I measured my urine and got a reading of 8, and then headed to the Doctor. He measured my Urine which was 6 . I repeated this several times and had similar results indicating a higher PH reading with these strips compared to the Doctors PH strips . Make believe test strips........maybe!Biomedical Engineer, Norm"
4,Forever My Lady,"Forever My Lady is well written and states eloquently that ""love is all you need...self-love that is."" This book is makes a good read."
5,Strong enough for Men and a must for Women,"Jeff Rivera manages to find that balance between crafting a book that men will read because it takes into account the struggles some have had in their lives, and it has just enough romance and suspense that women will appreciate. It's not easy to write a book that will bring both sexes together for a discussion, but Jeff has managed to do it. Great job."
5,Loved it!,"Forever My Lady by Jeff Rivera is wonderful. Nothin will come close to how great this book is. It talks about the truth with how life is. I didn't want to put the book down. I stopped doing everything else just to read.It's one of very few novels I can relate to. Jeff Rivera is an insperation to all Hispanics/Mexicans/Latinos to strive to become better people. To realise that this gang life we live isnt what we should be doing.Just like Dio struggled through life, so did we. Rivera is starting a new generation of writing. The descriptions are so clear you can be able to picture everything thats going on. We can all learn from what is happening in this book.Recomended to all. This book makes me speachless, thats how good it is."
4,RCA-128 Good Buy for the Bucks!,"Being a collector of Old Time Radio in the CDR-MP3 format, I wanted a player that I could use at home or with a small group of people. The RCA-128 fits the bill with pretty good sound reproduction in an economical unit that works well at home or with a group such as at a nursing home. So far, it plays all the bit-rates that I've thrown at it and often makes the sound ""appear"" better than on the computer's playback from the same CDR. Some I record on my own and others I have purchased or traded for and there's no real standard bit-rate established for this stuff. This ""new"" technology in the RCA-128 makes the ""old"" technology sound real good and it cost much less than a hundred bucks! A real good buy for my perposes!"
5,After failure comes success. Another great Herbert book,"After reading ""Dune Messiah"" i was thinking about not reading any other Dune book. I did good not to do so. After hours of boredom with ""Dune Messiah"" here comes the deliverance. This book deals with the childhood of the dead Dune hero's kids. Dune is in a change. The Fremen are trying to fertilize the desert soil of Arrakis. They want the planet to be more friendly with it's inhabitants. Go with Leto, the dead Emperor's son onto a trip you won't forget and watch his transformation into something much more powerfull then man."
4,"Good final for Preacher ,strong start for Atreides Emperor",I think that it's a full passing and ending book. I've not get 5. and 6. books yet but I know that after 3. book the story go into quite different way.I'm about finish 4. book nowadays and as if I read a another first book.The reason's 3. book. The book shuts a chapter that existence first three book .The book prepares and shows us for new amazing thing. Herbert is showing boundless of his dream.
4,The ending saves this book,"The first three-quarters of this book gets really bogged down in itself. Mr. Herbert tries to explain too much in just a short amount of pages. But the ending just blew me away. Mr. Herbert surprises you with the re-emergence of Paul Muad'Dib, and I thought the ending was just phenomenal. I give it four stars."
3,Laza Tigers,"After reading this book, I have come to a startling conclusion...this book could have been saved had Leto II and Ghanima been eaten by the Laza Tigers. What a couple of brats! At least let Tyekanik kick them in the head a few times with his shiny new Sardaukar boots! In all seriousness though, I have never been so disappointed since reading the last 1/4th of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. The characters simply EVAPORATE! The characters who don't evaporate obviously have Multiple Personality Disorder. It is so obvious that Frank Herbert did not know where he was taking this story, and did an about-face to the extreme detriment of the story. The only characters I found interesting at all were Duncan and Farad'n. Seeing Leto II hack a gob of snot upon all the faces of my favorite characters without getting a crysknife stuck up his jaw was also not very enjoyable."
2,He tries to get back inline,"There is an effort here to go back to the original style, but it is still full of boring political drabble. Then superworm comes to the rescue and makes everyone bow down to him. The end, and no more Dune for William."
3,Quickly Deteriorating,"I normally dont read books more than once. Dune (book 1) is an exception. I have read that one 3 times and would read it again. The imagination of Mr Herbert is awe inspiring. I was hoping the same quality of story and writing would continue, but alas that is not the case. Dune Messiah was a decent read but it tends to be a bit slow. Children of Dune was an even bigger dissapointment. This book is slow and very repetative. I mean how many times do we have to hear about the ""pre-born"" and their abilities? How many times do we have to hear about the Atreides twins taking offense at being called children? It just goes on and on. Anyhooo...I think I will give the next book a shot because so many reviewers gave it high marks. Lets hope Book 4 is better, otherwise I'm done."
5,Hero of Classic Sci-fi,"Rarely has a book been as beautifully and poniontly written as Children of Dune, Frank Herbert's third book in the Dune Chronicles. Filled with all of the original cast and several new charecters, Children of Dune explores like its predecessors the creation of Gods and Messiahs from men, albeit prodigal men, but men nonetheless; the creations of empires and the development of societies; and the relationships that bind people together throughout the ages.In short, a wonderful book that I highly recommend."
5,Every woman knows a guy like Billy...so does every guy!,"I picked up this book in a small gift shop in Nova Scotia. It was snapshot in words and the characters from places just visited came alive with down to earth creative writing. The stories may appeal more to men than women with gutsy descriptions of high school girls in love with the ""other guy"" or the husband watching his sleeping lover and thinking of his wife and child. And yet, you can help yorself from feeling a genuine warm spot for the ""everyman"" hero. The author says more in ten pages than some say in a novel. Try it...you'll like it!"
1,What a load of horrible overdubbing.,"There is no French soundtrack on this DVD to go with the legendary French actors. There is just an English subtitle with HORRIBLE english overdubbing. The voices are woefully miscast, even worse if you are familiar with the famous French actors true voices. And the Foley work is just amateurish. It was a total distraction throughout the whole 3 hours. Absolutely a waste, with little entertainment value. Stay clear and try to find a version with original dialogue (and English subtitles if necessary)."
1,Gerard DUB-pardieu,"WARNING! Allow me to join the group of other naysayers about this insult of an edition from Lionsgate. The English dubbing sounds like a bunch of wacky and untalented college kids snuck into the film studio and, as a joke, recorded their own soundtrack to this telemovie. And nobody at Lionsgate caught the mistake before releasing it to unsuspecting patrons like myself. Some joke. I couldn't make it past twenty minutes. Imagine the great Jeanne Moreau talking like Selma Diamond and you'll have some idea to how excruciating this version is. Depardieu is closer to Howie Mandel for all you Mandel fans (include me out, please.) In a single word: Irresponsible."
1,It's Dubbed!,"It's dubbed - and not very skillfully either. Yuck. I couldn't watch it, so I can't complain otherwise."
1,Too violent for very young children,My husband and both thought this movie was very violent for our 3 year old grandson. I was very disappointed with the movie...
5,My son loves these headphones,"A christmas gift for my son the drummer. He uses these each time he plays, and says they are of high quality. I'm happy these headphones are protecting his hearing. He also uses them with earbuds, with the volume set much lower than he otherwise would."
4,Great quality except...,"These are amazing. Excellent. I put on ear phones and then these and I can play along to any song I want at a low volume. I can play for hours without getting a headache or hurting anywhere, contrary to the low ratings here. My only objection is that the wires are flimsy, and after a few months of playing they had gone out of shape. All I do is simply put them on my head and take them off. I have a big head... maybe the wires get flexed too much? Either way, what this means is that sometimes the cups aren't pressed firmly against my head and don't isolate well, but that's easily fixed by moving them around a little.Get them, or the ones with audio, simply because they have incredible isolation!"
4,Convenient Appliance,"The ECM21 is a great, convenient unit. The removable fill container is nice in that it can be easily cleaned unlike other coffee makers. I like the 1-4 cup brew option which delivers fuller flavor coffee if used when brewing more servings (takes longer). The milk steamer has adequate pressure and is consistent time after time. One drawback to this unit- why I give it a 4 is the carafe spills very easily if one pours too quickly."
2,Horrible!,I bought this after reading the great reviews on how well it made coffee...which it does. However right off the bat the coffee decanter leaked when pouring...BAD! Fortunately I was able to get it replaced thru the manufacturer. Wish it had an auto-off. The expresso maker is so-so. And why Amazon would not ship the gold filter at the same time they shipped the coffee maker is beyond me. I never got an answer on that.Part 2: After a few months of having this coffee maker it has just become a waste of money. It leaks from the bottom and when making a full pot for some reason it does not use all the water in the container where you put the water in. I'm really hating this coffee maker and wasted my money.Don't bother with it.
5,WE LOVE OURS,WE PURCHASED OURS ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO. SINCE THEN HAVE PREPARD ABOUT 45 EXPRESSO'S AND IT WORKS GREAT. WE HAVE HAD 0 PROBLEMS TO REPORT AND THE COFFEE POT WORKS GREAT ALSO
3,good cheap java machine but...,"I was slightly apprehensive after reading some negative reviews. One reviewer complained that the carafe was difficult to pour without spilling, correct. Coffee maker works fine, espresso side works fine but the carafe for the coffee maker dribbles coffee all over the counter with astounding regularity. I have it a month and pour slow, pour fast, pour slower, pour faster nothing keeps this baby delivering joe down the middle of your cup. If you can bear that annoyance, this machine is fine. Directions are useless."
3,"No regrets, but needs improvement","My wife has figured out how to make it do everything, so no regrets.But, as someone else pointed out, extra care needs to be taken when pouring from the carafe. In the first week I spilled coffee 3 times. Never had a problem w/ the old Mr. Coffee.Also, this unit takes at least 3x the amount of time to make the same amount of coffee as the old Mr. C."
3,Great for the casual coffee drinker,"I bought this product in August 2009. I have loved it as it gets my morning going, and has an awesome espresso maker (for the price). It has downfalls too though. It has always been a slow brewer, but makes good coffee. Recently, it has been extremely slow and bitter tasting. I run vinegar though it every month or two to clean it out (as I use it daily), but having just done it again, it hasn't improved. It has served me well for a year and a half, and may be time to upgrade. Definitely clean it out regularly.Overall, worth buying if you aren't expecting coffee house coffee and will clean it regularly."
1,I would rate lower if it was possible,I received this coffeemaker/espresso machine as a gift and I am glad I didn't spend my own money on it. I would of ran to the store after the first brew to return it. The coffee maker carafe leaks regardless of how careful you are to pour coffee. The lid came off and I had to be especially careful not to damage the flimsy plastic holding it together. It takes over 30 minutes to brew 8 cups of coffee. The espresso part of the machine works when it wants.I could go on and on. But I chose to put it away and return my old one to the counter top. So glad I didn't waste my money.
1,NOT A GOOD BUY,THIS COFFEE MAKER IS JUNK.FOR 60.00 IT WAS A VERY BAD BUYWHEN YOU POUR THE COFFEE FROM THE POT IT LEAKS ALL OVER THE PLACE.2 THE EXPRESSO DOES NOT GET HOT AT ALLTHIS IS NOT A COLD EXPRESSO MACHINE RIGHT.I TRIED CONTACKING MR COFFEE CO BUT NO REPLYALL WAYS PUT ON HOLD FOREVER.I WILL NEVER BUY A COFFEE MAKER FROM AMIZON OR MR COFFEE AGAINALSO THE COFFEE MAKER WAS SCRATCHED AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A USED ONE
3,coffee maker review,the coffee pot/carafe fits very tightly underneath the device that allows you to pour a cup while the pot is still brewing. So tightly you can't pull it out too fast or you'll spill. But the pour-spout on the pot itself spills so you have to pour v-e-r-y slowly. And speaking of slow...allow about 10 min for a complete pot of coffee...it doesn't brew very fast.
1,Do not buy this machine,I was given this as a gift. It is bad news. The coffee pot leaks and makes it worthless when pouring. Who designed that? Also no single cup ability but even worse no automatic shut off. Bad design overall. Don't buy it
1,Problem with basic operation,"I'm sorry to say that I didn't heed the warning of other reviewers beforebuying this machine. Most people complained about the leaking coffee pitcher, but said it was no big deal. However, the pitcher leaks all over, especially when full and nearing empty. I am very surprised this machine got to market this way. Pretty annoying that you can pour the coffee out of a coffer maker without wasting a lot of it and making a mess. Needless to say I returned it."
3,"A nice piece, a bit overpriced.........","Bought this for my Halloween party. It was shipped quickly.I like the piece, was a big hit at the party, but I think the price was just a bit much."
4,Pleasing if knowledgable in photography,"David Carson is undoubtedly one of the best graphic designers and a revolutionary typographist ... but unless you understand the angles and complexity of photography, I don't think you'd really want to get this book. Sure, Carson does have a wonderful eye for color, balance, and emotional insight, BUT if you're looking for a photography book with more text and a better composition, you might want to extend your search."
1,Innovative? Pfff...,"I dare to disagree. Maybe in today's boring photography scene a planless collection of either totally uninteresting or blurry photographs, that would be rejected in any amateur contest, are considered as rule breaking or innovative... but for luck I have seen photographs that were made before these. Every second collection of contemporary photographs that I look at, and that is marketed as art, shows about this same stuff. I'll just go out and take them myself if I want to own a picture of the three knobs on a washing machine, combined with a pseudo-deep comment. Maybe I can find the sense of life in them I will frame them and hang them on my wall.Uhmm..I won't."
1,What were they thinking?,"I bought this recorder to record lectures, and it does record lectures reasonably well.However, in playback mode - the silly thing has NO PAUSE BUTTON! What were they thinking?Normally, a device of this kind has a ""playback pause"" button - so you can pause playback. A Pause feature is always standard, because it is an essential recorder function. But not this RCA unit!Instead, you can only stop the playback - which is like a playback reset - and then you have to hold down the ""fast-forward"", (which is only about double normal speed) - in order to get back to where you left off!It is so incredibly frustrating - I felt compelled to write this review about it!Normally, a ""pause button"" is standard - it is on EVERY OTHER recorder I have ever owned. But it is not included on this RCA unit.What were they thinking?"
2,Western Taiji?,Major flaw: the sword is too light and too western looking. Chinese sword is never patterned with an eagle and the Holy mother.
5,Thriller adventure novel,"Hard to put down type of book. Action and adventure with a kind of spiritual twist to it. I liked the way the countryside was shown and what is what like to be in Egypt, Greece and AFrica.It's an adventure story about the search for and finding of a lost scroll of Mohammad's. A geological surveyor/archeologist in Egypt finds an ancient chamber with clues to some writings that Mohammad supposobly hid away. They were written down by his scribe, Zayd ibn Thabit. Upon return to his base camp, he and his companions are attacked by terrorists and most of their data stolen. This starts an adventure to find the lost writings taking the reader on an adventure throughout the Middle East to Greece and finally to Ethiopia.Scary and tense at times, but well told tale."
2,Disappointing,"Read Winter Garden, it's far superior. This one is full of implausibilities, little sexual tension, aggravating hero, the mystery was so OBVIOUS...and there was no ""set up"" for the ""dark secret"" in her past. Read if you are a fan, but if you are new to this author, definitely check out My Darling Caroline or Winter Garden for superior romances, and skip this one."
4,Good portable fan,"Cools my backup drives while installed in a drive dock. Variable speed is nice. The take up reel keeps things neat. Quiet at low speeds. Louder at high speed but fans blow air so they make noise. I haven't had a need to run at full speed anyway. I don't have a need for a power switch if you really need one it would be easy enough to solder on a micro switch.Pros:USB power is great. I wish I had found this sooner.Small but powerful if you need it to be.Variable speed.Take up reel keeps the cable out of the way when not in use.Cons:Because it's small and light weight yet powerful it tends to move on my desktop over time, especially at higher speeds. If they added some weight to the base it would help. I place a ceramic coaster on top of the base and it stays put. If you are going to run at full speed and it's on a smooth surface it's going to move. This is why I removed one star."
4,I like it.,"I have a desk with an enclosed side for my PC tower. It has an opening in the back for airflow, but it was always hot in there. This little fan set up in the back to move the air is perfect and now it stsys much cooler. Since it's USB, when my computer is off (and it's not needed), the fan is off! Very quiet. I can't even tell it's there! It could use a little more umph in the movement of air, but for the size, it works okay."
4,Great Little Fan,"This is a great little fan. I purchased one to help cool my laptop. The fan came with a metal heightening bar, which I didn't care for but is easily removable. I give the fan a 4 star rating simply because I wish the air output was a little bit higher. My only concern is regarding the fan wire which is not reinforced. If you're not careful and decide to carry the fan inappropriately, the wire soldering may eventually degrade and cause the wires to pull out of the fan."
4,Thermaltake USB Fan,"Great little fans. I purchased 4 of them for a video recording kiosk box. I love that I can just plug them into the computer rather than have to figure out the wiring. They are quiet, but not silent at low speeds. Instead of using 2 fans in the kiosk (one cool air in, one hot air out) I had to only use one since the microphone did pick up some air noise. The air noise could just be related the box that the kiosk is installed into. The air speed control knob is solid and feels quite high quality and easy to control. I would highly recommend these fans. Hopefully they will last the run of the kiosk."
5,Great to cool my hot receiver in closed cabinet,"I use this fan to cool down a Onkyo receiver inside my closed cabinet. I put it in the top of the receiver pushing hot air out of the cabinet, and it works great. I recommend buying aSmart Strip LCG4 Energy Saving Power Strip with Autoswitching Technologyso when I turn off the receiver, the fan turns off automatically as well. I also had to buy aUSB Wall AC Chargerbecause the fan gets power from a USB source. The fan has a potentiometer, so you can select the fan speed, choosing a level which does not generate much noise and still works effectively.Pros:- pot to control fan speed level / noise level- small, efficient, ideal to cool down audio equipment on closed cabinetsCons:- needs USB power (it can be an advantage if you're cooling down an equipment with USB out, like a PS3)"
5,Mobile Fan,I love this fan. It was cheap to buy and its pretty quiet. I use it primarily to cool down my XBox 360. It's a lot better than some of the more expensive junk that available for cooling the 360. You can't go wrong with this device. I really recommend this product to all gamers.
1,Broken Supports and Noisy Operation,"The production quality of this fan is terrible! Two support spokes in the back of the fan case were broken upon delivery and the metal parts seem to have been mounted incorrectly. Because the fan's case is defective the fan vibrates and its blades strike the sides of the duct. All this shaking and scraping produces ""nails across a chalkboard"" noise. Even an attempted fix with cyanoacrylate glue hasn't eliminated the whine from this pesky fan. The roll-up cord hasn't been much help to me either. The speed control works well--I can change the whine from hellish to just annoying."
2,Not very smart,"Not much air, but apart from that the issue I have is yes you can turn the air from low to high (which is not really high), but to stop it you have to unplug it from the usb port. Why oh why could you not turn it down from high to.....off. It is very annoying to have to plug it in and unplug it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM USED!!!!,"Well, just to put it shortly I am working on a project that I needed a USB fan for. I got this in the mail, extremely excited about it. I opened it to find a small, strangle plastic piece. Not knowing what it is, I plugged the fan in. The fan barely put out ANY air and made a GOD AWFUL noise. Turns out, the plastic piece was one of the four missing to keep the fan in place. It is flying all over the inside of the metal cage, and it wont work properly."
5,Quiet and Effective,"I bought this cooling fan to use in my home theater cabinet. My receiver only had about and inch and a half of clearance to the shelf above it, and I was a little worried about circulation, so I picked this up. The adjustable speed knob is awesome, as I was able to set it low enough to be basically inaudible while still fast enough to circulate air. I simply set it on a little cardboard box behind my receiver and plugged it into the USB port of the receiver, so the fan automatically turns on and off with the receiver. Assuming it lasts anywhere near the quoted life expectation of 30,000 hours, I will be a happy purchaser."
4,"Pretty useful, but a little too loud","I got this fan as additional cooling for my Acer 5672WLMi which gets uncomfortably hot everytime I try to run it. This was my second Thermaltake Mobile Fan II and both work fine at low levels (moves decent amounts of air), but when you turn the speed dial up the fan can become a little noisy. Aside from the noise, the variable speed feature is nice, but there isn't an on/off switch, but that isn't a big deal to me. I'd give this a 4.5/5.0 if I could. Good Product"
1,Colour Version??,"I emailed the people who sell this DVD and specifically asked them if the Pride and Prejudice film was FINALLY the colour version which vert occasionally screens on tv. Yes, I was assured it was the colour version. I can say having just received the DVD - this is NOT the colour version of Pride and Prejudice finally come to DVD. It is absolutely and definitely the black and white version that I already own.The films are great but there is nothing new in these releases. If you don't already own the films you will love them but don't buy them hoping for something fresh if you already have them in your collection."
2,Not durable at all,"Bag started tearing off within a year. Then purchased Jansport one, which is going on strong 4+ years now! Won't recommend this bag."
2,Newsman Howard K. Smith mentions this book prominently.,"In his own extraordinarily insightful 1942 book ""Last Train From Berlin"" the late Howard K. Smith wrote that the Nazis were overjoyed to have been handed the gift of American Jew Nathan Kaufman's diatribe, ""Germany Must Perish."" According to Smith, at first the Nazis merely sold Kaufman's pamphlet cheaply, but eventually distributed a copy to every German family with their ration card. Kaufman's book gave the Nazis a propaganda windfall and even another excuse for eliminating the Jews of Germany. Pointing to Kaufman's writing, the Nazi's message to the German people was a simple one: get them before they get you. Thus, I'm afraid Kaufman's book is an extremely unfortunate example of the ""law of unintended consequences."" Smith's book, by the way, is one of the few I've read that presents the war from inside Germany, and I certainly recommend it. I had never realized that the veteran and venerable newscaster was such an accomplished writer."
5,Just what I needed!!,"I love the book; when get all the time i need, i will soon get organized. Thanks for the suggestions!!Mildred Rickett"
4,Great Read,"This book is very good and well written. It gives some great ideas that are basic, but perhaps not even thought of. Very helpful worth the money and a good read."
3,Motorcycling in Japan,"The title of the book initially stopped me from buying it, however being the only book written about motorcycle travel in Japan (in English) I eventually purchased a copy having little luck elsewhere researching this subject.Its a basic source of information talking about some good roads for motorcyle riding from Tokyo and further away told from the point of view of someone living there doing rides away on weekends or similar.The author speaks fluent Japanese and writes from the point of view that the reader will be able to speak Japanese if riding in Japan and be familiar with many aspects of Japan like he is, so the route info is really all this book offers.Still that in itself is impossible to find elsewhere and perhaps worth the price if you are planning a motorcycle tour in Japan."
2,RCA needs improvement in this class,"The RP2450 has all the bells and whistles you could want. ID3, support for WMA and MP3 and many other features you would want with a portable. I bought this unit because I thought it was a great deal with all those features. I bought and returned two units because they wouldn't even play a standard, off the shelf, music CD without skipping. I even put the unit down so that it wouldn't move and still got some distortion or skipping. MP3 played a little better but not good enough for me. How did this get to the store shelves? What RCA engineer approved this? RCA needs to go back to the drawing board. I will not buy another RCA portable until I see better reviews over a long period of time just because of my experience with this unit. I'll stick with the better quality units."
1,Not What I was expecting,"This is totally not what I expected. It is nothing but a how to guide for the software and nothing more- No useable info without software.....After reading the write up, I figured I would be able to get something useful, But No...So unless you have the software, don't bother, total waste of money."
1,Stone fell out,"the first day I wore this ring, one of the stones fell out. The day it fell out I was typing on the computer. Did not even know it came out till later. Did not find the stone. Would not recomend this ring."
1,"Cheaply made, not a ""disc,"" but a weird sphere, and not much fun.","Bought because store described it as hover ""disc,"" but received this weird cross between a true spherical ball and a football, a big one. Lost air first time kids played with it, and won't hold air. Not worth buying under any circumstances."
3,Just what I wanted,This is exactly what I was hoping for. Have been baking more and more since I lost my job so this is exactly what I needed.
4,Historical interest,I lived through the same years at nearly the same age in slightly different circumstances but with the same external global influences. Great to have another her perspective from some one else involved in aerospace.
5,A Great Book,"This Book is AWESOME! It is about a couple of coalwood highschoolers that decide to start building rockets. They test different fuels and use different materials. Therre are so many exciting points! Homer's dad works in a mine and one of the rockets flies mine there! Although they have some trouble with girls, this is still my faorite book."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book! If you have a child who thinks he is not smart, make him read this book!"
5,Must Read,"If you are someone who struggles with reading due to a learning disability then you probably struggle to read. I know I do. Well, this book goes down like a cold glass of water on a hot day. You can't stop. Mr. Hickam is an immensely talented author. This is a worthwhile read for almost any age. I read it when I was 33 and loved it. Books like this are rare do yourself a favor and read it. Very few books make time disappear and this is one of them. As a word of caution, The Coalwood Way, the sequel to October Sky/Rocket Boys, is not half as good as this one."
5,Old fashioned values in a cynical time,"I came to this book via the film and I enjoyed both immensely. I liked the honesty of the relationship with his father and the absolute need to take his own path. It is full of terrific stories and creates a tremendous picture of life in a Coal town, when a young man wants to break the mould of football hero and charts his own course as a rocket scientist."
2,Meandering,"A slow read, but rather charming. Definitely a memoir, not a novel. Would be fascinating to an engineer or rocket scientist -- less so for the average reader. I stopped reading several times, and had to drag myself back to it. Yet in the end, I'm glad I finished it. I think I'd like to read a ""condensed"" version of this book. It needs some tightening up."
5,This is not the actual hardcover version,This is not the actual hardcover version of this book. The approved hardcover version can be found under the title Rocket Boys: A Memoir. This is a rebound version of the little paperback retitled October Sky.
3,OK but not perfect for protection,"Gloves were delivered prompty. They are the gauntlet design I was looking for. However, they are different than the all-leather kind I had for a few years, and finally wore out. This pair has 2 kinds of leather, a rough leather on the cuff, and a kind of funny, shiny, smooth leather in the hand portion. This is the slightly darker part you see in the picture. The first time I used them, it was a cool, showery April day here in Seattle, and they got pretty wet. Then as I was cleaning up after a couple hours of use, I noticed a thistle that needed to be picked, just about a foot across, hugging the ground, and about ready to shoot a stalk up. So I reached down and grabbed it, and OUCH, one of the thorns stabbed right through into my index finger. I've been pretty careful with them since, which kind of defeats the reason for having a heavy-duty gauntlet glove."
4,Its a good collection but Dark Fury is still on only DVD...,"This release has the directors cuts and unrated versions of the full length features however Dark Fury is still only on DVD (it came in today and I've already watched them). So its a good way to own all three features and a solid price and includes all the ""extras"". I'm not sure if Dark Fury will ever be released on Blu-Ray as I don't believe that the animation team had made it at a level that will support it, though it could be remastered...Just a thought..."
4,"A sweet story, simply told","Like so many excellent, non-Hollywood films, this one is quiet and subtle. At times, in fact, you wonder if it is indeed it's going somewhere. It is, but it takes it's time getting there (time well spent) and it does it in a marvelous, touching way. I rented this film on a whim (saw it on the shelf having never heard of it and thought, ""Why not?""). It was a very pleasant surprise, alternately funny and sad, always touching. When you're tired of car explosions and sexcapades and soulless story telling that inhabits so many of todays films, turn to this one."
4,"Excellent sequel to module X2, Castle Amber","Mark of Amber is an elaborate boxed set adventure that picks up the story of the classic Lovecraftian jaunt, X2 Castle Amber (Chateau d'Ambreville)! Clark Ashton Smith's venomous faerie dreamworld of French romance and intrigue comes vividly alive once more as Etienne d'Ambreville, the most powerful Archmagus in the magocracy of Glantri, is missing and presumed dead... worse, a sinister assassin of seemingly endless power and ingenuity is stalking the d'Ambreville nobles one by one, and only you can save them... how? By plunging yourself into the living nightmares of a dying Immortal. Told you it was fun... :) for levels 4-6."
4,Good outdoor zwave plug,This is a good device at a good price the only downside is does not store scene info in the device
5,LOL,We love Ernest and were so glad to get all three movies in one. Ernest goes to Camp has always been one of our favorites.
3,Capable of better,"It is possible to see in this book, if you are patient with it, the same mind and authorial voice that produced ""1599:A Year in the Life of Shakespeare"", particularly in the humanity of the work and the intensity of its research, but Oberammergau reads as being more of an unresolved personal statement of a proposition that is never quite articulated. It is frustrating. I left wanting to know more about the author than the play or the community itself. For someone like Shapiro, this must not be unknown territory, just forbidden. There is a much more interesting book lurking just behind the scenes of Oberammergau."
2,The Trouble is...what?,"I'm a little concerned about Shapiro's grasp of the primary source material. Oberammergau is a place where Catholics put on a play about events re-enacted from an exclusively Christian memoir. There are the good guys, that'd be Jesus and His crew, and then there are the bad guys, that'd be the Romans and the Jews, only not the Jews who're Jesus and His crew, some other ones. See. It's a story. They are acting out a story. Perhaps someone needs to write the story in reverse. If it makes a better story we'll probably all be able to look forward to a better play."
5,Big Tymer,"This was Fiend's first CD, and I thought he would really make it big. I especially liked the fact that he also had UGK on this album. Feind made a big impact when he came out on Master P's album Ghetto Dope, on Make 'Em Say Uuhhhh."
3,There's One in Every Family,"One of the top No Limit to ever hit the shelves, Fiend's ""There's One in Every Family"" hits hard from beginning to end. Tracks like ""Take My Pain"" , ""Who Got the Fire"" and ""The Baddest"" show Fiend's versatility and showcase how he uses his gruff voice to varying degrees to show different types of emotion. The standout track, the UGK assisted ""Slangin'"", hits hard like most of the album, but is put over the top by Pimp C and Bun B's Texas drawl complimenting the No Limit soldier's hard rhymes. The only detractor on this album is the fact that so many guests take away additional verses from the star of the album. Very good album overall."
2,Fiend is great but not this time,come on all the people that gave this cd 5 or 4 stars what were you thinkin some songs were ok the only song that i can listen to a lot is the baddest don't get me wrong Fiend is great but this album is wack peace out
4,Learning Again,This book is well prepared and presented. It is being used in a Hebrew class for adults with friends. Only faults with this series is they look as if they are comic books (which may not be a bad aspect).Richard
2,Both good and bad.,"While ""Tides"", by Scott Mackay was an intriguing book, I was surprised by the simplicity of the writing. It seemed the author kept repeating the same phrases, for example writing the phrase ""cache of weapons"" twice in the same paragraph. I also found it a bit amazing that Hab, the main character, invented submersible ships and handguns, circumnavigated the globe, AND created a democracy from a former monarchy.But, ""Tides"" was suspenseful and presented interesting ideas. Finding a balance between all truth and all lies seems relevant to our own world today."
1,TASTE TERRIBLE,This was a cookie that tasted like a dog biscuit.It has no chocolate flavor.I would never order it again.
4,Time to change the product picture... False Advertising,"Product works as intended and great price, but really pi$$es me off when you get a brown box recycled item after you order a ""Original HP LaserJet 27X Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging - Dual Pack"" and the pretty HP box is shown in the ad.So far so good, no problems with product itself yet. Been using it for about 6 months now, very low duty cycle, so I have toner for a while.So.... what's the deal with all this?"
4,Build quality varies with each purchase,"It appears to be very difficult to cut these accurately or Rane hasn't figured that out. The upside is that I've not gotten a really bad one, just never a perfect one. Some the center hole is a little too big, some the start point (where record is blank first) seems a bit off or hard to get to with my needles (using Orofon Nightclub S). Overall the quality is still good, just not excellent."
4,More fun than functional,"This case does give added protection to your player, but also adds more bulk. Having said that, it is fun and cute. I don't know that I would have bought one for myself, but I got it as a gift and I like it."
2,Incomplete,"I would not order these kits from Amazon - They are grossly incomplete. Order them from the manufacturer. We ordered for a homeschool program and found pieces missing in several. Of course, Amazon only gives you a finite amount of time to return and the box does not contain a master list of inclusions when you get it, only an experiment by experiment list. You literally have to open EVERYTHING and read through the entire instructions on on ALL three experiments kits' which contain approximately 5-6 experiments each in order to know if you have everything. Bottom line, don't order from Amazon."
2,Not much useful for reasonably adept developers,"Having worked with Access for a long time, I wanted a book that would help with constructing sites in SQL Server. This book was way too simplistic and spends far too much time on installing NT and IIS, and not enough on 'building sites with SQL Server'. Only cursory look at ASP code to actually interact with your site, almost all of it via Interdev. Index is lacking in detail, even common interface elements. If you're a very beginner, then maybe this book will be good for you, but I'd look elsewhere."
1,"Great title, minimal content","This book concentrates on the mechanics of setting up NT, IIS, etc. and has very little about actually building SQL server Web sites. There's almost no guidence about how to design a relational database with SQL server."
5,They were Expendable,They video was was great and the shipper shipped it in an outstanding way and arrived in excellent condition.
3,A Modernist View,"This book is filled with well-taken photos and brief descriptions. There is no in-depth discussion of design theory or analysis of process. Most of the examples seem to pay homage, though color or form, to Modern design principles and practice. I would NOT recommend this book to somone seeking truly innovative, forward design references. It has large, well-lit, high quality reproductions and would therefore be better suited for a coffee table."
1,It should have a warning label on it.,"I like war and action books. I am a former submariner, so I was looking forward to reading my first book from this author.I only read the first 1/3 of it and put it away. I am not a prude, but the graphic (I mean REALLY graphic, unecesary sex scenes, and unnecesarily sick torture scenes were so blatantly offensive that I will probably never read another book by this author again! It should be restricted to a shelf in an Adult Bookstore.Aside from that, the book is cluttered with too much procedural detail. It might have gotten better, but I couldn't wade through the garbage long enough to see.I'm no expert, but I think Mr. DiMercurio should run, not walk to the nearest therapist before he attempts to write again."
3,Miss Song's beauty at its crispiest.,"Maybe it's just that the Chinese dvds have incredibly clearer pictures but the lead actress really looks at the apex of her beauty in this drama. The English subtitles are less insane than the Chinese dvds for Winter Sonata and 18 vs. 29. This drama was produced after Sandglass and has a similar narrative style even the music sounds the same. I didn't mind buying this drama sight unseen because I remember its hype and popularity and most importantly, the price is right at under $25. I would prefer that a dvd packaged be done well and mass produced at an affordable price than this unhealthy for the consumer pricing nearer to the $100 mark. It makes people feel bad that a mere entertainment item is out of reach. It's not a car nor a house, it's not even a winter coat. Lower the average prices PLEASE."
3,"Good overview for the beginner, but not enough detail","This book is worth buying if you are after a broad look at dealing with CFS, but it does not really explore the causes of CFS widely enough or in enough detail. It focusses too narrowly on dysbiosis as a cause of CFS, and doesn't explore in any detail toxicity and detoxification, mitochondrial problems, nutritional deficiencies and endocrine problems. This book isn't going to help you cure your CFS, but it has a few interesting chapters. Try Jacob Teitelbaum's book From Fatigued To Fantastic, although this doesn't really mention toxicity at all either. A good overview of toxicity can be found at health-spy dot com."
2,Needs to be authored by an expert.,"I was dissapointed by the author's obvious lack of expertise on the subject which was demonstrated in many areas of the book. For example he states that ""nobody really knows what causes St Elmo's fire"", yet most high school science students know exactly what causes it. He also discusses ball lightning as if it were real, when it's never been proven to exist. Rather than trying to be easy to understand, the author opted for cutesy phrases as if he were talking to a four year old, to the point that it is difficult to understand even the table of contents. All in all, it was a letdown."
4,Cary Grant? The skipper of an American sub? No way.,"Way. Unlike a lot of pretty movie stars, Grant had talent & could play anything believeably. Proof here. He is Capt. Cassidy of the USS Copperfin. It can be forgiven its jingoistic, propaganda tone (hey, there's a war going on!) because it is a very good movie. It was done in the Warner Bros. trademark style: efficient with no wasted effort. It has the added virtue of being done mid-war, 1943, like its competiton from Century Fox, Crash Dive. It is slightly better without that silly Tyrone Power romance nonsense. It has the stock character actors most notably Alan Hale as Cookie. I love that guy! Also just like a Warner Bros. film, it was shot in glorious black & white which is the way I prefered it, thank-you. Great war-time stuff."
4,ace rocking by some manly dudes,"Head to head with any album reviewed on Amazon as ""with balls"", this'll demonstrate greater control over the uptempo, heavy, chaotic, exploding stuff every time. If it had more tunes I'd put it on every week. ""The Doldrums"" and ""Supernova That Never Quits"" are the ones that keep playing in my head (cos they're tunes).A fave punk alb practically no one in my hemisphere knows about."
1,Review of ACP-EP RAM,Company ANTonline says their RAM is 100% compatible. IT'S NOT. Worst customer service of ANY COMPANY I have ever dealt with. They would not and will not respond. Have 8 documented attempts to reach them via email and phone. HORRIBLE - do not buy from!
2,Not an easy listen,"The performances are fine but this CD has a fundamental problem that spoils the listening experience, at least for this listener: the dynamic range of the recording is so wide that it is impossible to find a comfortable volume level. Set it at a reasonable level for the quiet opening and it will split your eardrums later on. Set it at a reasonbable level for the crescendos and much of the rest is virtually inaudible. This is a disk to show off your stereo system rather than one to enjoy for the music."
3,Interesting but sometimes obscure tales,"Howard Waldrop's stories have never been in any sense ordinary. He often surprises not only with strange subjects, but also with the way he handles them. Although (and unjustly) not well-known with the larger audience, his stories have won him a steady following. These new stories have all the elements of the typical Waldrop, but while he is investigating historical possibilities -- things that might have been, had some of the details of our past been a little different -- he is also becoming more obscure. One needs an encyclopedia, and the afterwords to the stories, to fully understand them. A very interesting collection, certainly, but there is the overall feel that Waldrop is too much embedded in his own intellectual games."
3,not bad,"I thought this book wasn't bad by today's standards. I like a lot of action in a story, however, and it fell somewhat short in that area. I enjoyed parts of it, especially the last couple of chapters, and any more that's about as good as the mainstream fiction work gets."
4,A Page Turner,"This book was lent to me by a person who knew I loved reading Grisham. Well they were right. This is another book which is a page turner. If this is Baldacci's style, I will be reading all of his works.In this book we watch as a typical American family is faced with the greed of a powerful corporation. You have a husband who is an executive at an technology firm. And his wife, a mother and attorney of the firm working on an important merger of two companies. One of which is the one he works for. The husband is working on making enough money so his wife can be a stay-at-home mother. Then he disapears with a cloud of alegations over his head. and his wife is left to clear his name.This book has all the excitment you would expect in a thriller. And you will turn the pages fast, looking to see what happens next. And even though you know there is no way she could posibbly beat the odds she is up against in real life, you will stay engrossed in this story."
3,Book Cover Missing,"This used hard back book came to me in great shape and it is a great story, but the book cover was missing. I did not realize the book would come without a cover."
1,Not even for the airplane,"If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious."
2,let down,"Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get ""done in"" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one."
5,TOTALly Awesome,"Baldacci's second book, Total Control was almost as good as Absolute Power. A friend loaned it to me and I couldn't put it down. I devoted an entire day to this thrilling mystery that leaves you at the edge of your seat for most of the 700 pages.Baldacci uses Poe's idea of having everything lead and relate to the ending. I had no idea that this book was going to end the way it did and I commend Baldacci for making such an intricate plot. Two thumbs Up!!"
4,A non-stop show-stopping read!,"Amazing book! I enjoyed reading Absolute Power, and Total Control is a great read.. Hard to put down..Since the book is set right here in DC, I felt right at home!"
5,Impressive Suspense...,"This was the first book I read from David Baldacci. I couldn't put it down! It's a great book full of suspense and unanticipated action!It's rare that I feel the adrenaline rush while sitting on the couch and reading, but this time I couldn't wait to turn the page! If you like suspense books and are into reading, fraud and hackers you must pick this up!I am definitely going to be a loyal David Baldacci reader..."
2,"A Poor Follow-Up to ""Absolute Power""","David Baldacci showed he had a knack for characters and plotting in ""Absolute Power."" In ""Total Control"" (and his subsequent novels), he loses that knack. This book starts off very slow as he throws all of his character detail into the first few pages. He also has a very bad habit of telegraphing things that will happen later on in the story, so when it does appear the reader is neither surprised nor riveted. I won't bother writing a review for ""The Winner"" and his subsequent books; they are all the same. If you suffer from insomnia, read the first few chapters of his post-""Absolute Power"" works; they'll put you to sleep in no time."
4,HE'S GIVING GRISHAM A RUN FOR HIS MONEY!!!!,"DAVID IS AN EXCELLENT STORY TELLER. IT TRIPPED ME OUT WHEN...OOPS, SORRY. WELL,READ THE BOOK! IT HAD MORE SUSPENCE THAN I EVER IMAGINED."
2,disappointing,"did not read absolute power by author, but saw the movie (and liked it) . . . then somebody told me to read this . . . so i did--or make that, i heard the full version on audio tape . . . found it to be convoluted and long . . . had a good beginning, then fell apart."
4,"Baldacci back in ""Control"" again!","After the disappointing ""True Blue,"" it was nice to read another Baldacci thriller that fills the bill again. Sidney and Jeffrey Archer are your typical upwardly mobile couple, raising their little daughter Amy. Jeffrey works for a technology company, Sidney (yes, she's a girl) is a corporate attorney. Jeffrey has been doing some mysterious stuff after hours but the plane in which he is flying to LA mysteriously crashes, killing nearly 200 people. On the day of Jeffrey's memorial service, Sydney receives a phone call...from Jeffrey...which sets a non-stop thriller in motion that ultimately goes off in so many directions it's sometimes hard to keep up. There is corporate greed, a sex scandal, double identities, sociopaths, chases, gun battles, people sneaking around in dark office buildings. It's a thriller you can't put down."
3,Total Control by Balducci,"I ordinarily like Balducci a lot but this book was rather pedantic and not up to his usual suspense level. It took quite a bit of ""control"" for me to even finish it..."
4,If you've liked his other books - you'll enjoy this one too,"This book kept me reading until the end, but it is far from a masterpiece of fiction. It always amazed me how the main character, Sidney, a new mom and powerhouse lawyer, constantly escaped the hands of her predators, who, by the way, easily managed to kill everyone else Sidney contacted. But that's fiction for you.Overall I thought this was a good book though. It's the type of book that will keep you turning pages, even when you don't want to anymore. The ending was a little weak, but the story is complex and well written. I know that I'm not giving this book rave reviews, but I do respect authors like Baldacci for their ability to produce a book like this. I say that becuase it's something I don't think I could do."
1,YAWN,"It was hard to keep reading a book that allows for e-mail to flash on a screen and then disappear. Techno-jumble aside, there wasn't one character that was believable. I knew I was in trouble when the hero was a wizard of technology and had a genius for singlehandedly organizing a warehousefull of financial data without assistance. I had to force myself to the end."
3,"Rate it a 6-Not as good as ""Absolute Power""","Plot became hard to believe at the end, though it had good suspense level. Didn't get into the book until around page 200. Good book to while time away on airplane"
2,What a disappointment!,Time it took me to read Baldacci's books:Absolute Power=finished it on flight from Chicago to Los Angeles.Total Control= 2 weeks.Go figure.
2,I am so disappointed....,"I had purchased this book based on the suggestion of someone in one of my granny square swaps - I am returning it today. The color photos of the squares are 16 to a page - very hard to see - and the photos next to the patterns themselves are black and white. I have been crocheting for years and tried several patterns from this book - none of them came out well enough to use in my swap.Perhaps this book is good for very advanced crochet, but if that is the case, it should be made clear."
4,Are You Looking For Enlightenment?,"The core message in this book is WAKE UP! Its corollary is WATCH YOUR MIND. That's it. The book contains entertaining stories and some explanations of common misperceptions (i.e., delusions) experienced in everyday living. This book appears abstract to those only thirsting after enlightenment. But if you are seriously looking for awakening, practice awakening here and now.A word of warning for us all: If we confuse a finger pointing at the moon with enlightenment, then we get a poke in eye instead!"
1,They should have Never Fired Matt Fallon!,What were they thinking when they fired Matt Fallon(the original singer of Skid Row) Bach is over-rated and now won't even get back together with the original band and tour again. What a Loser!
5,Who says you can't go home again?,"Who says you can't go home again? Find a lost love and fullfill the dreams of long ago. In Peggy J. Herrings newest book I felt apart of the family, enjoyed the days of my own past and could not put it down. The richness of the story made me long for the days in Texas with lots and lots of family around. If you want a great love story then this is an excellent book for you to read. Of course all of Peggy's books are great."
4,good start,"I watched PR starting from season 3 and recently I read the newest book by Tim Gunn so I decided to get the first Season on DVD. Pulled an all-nighter and had a blast watching how it all began and comparing it to how it works now (Heidi doesn;t do as much personal greeting, Tim is smoother but still right on the mark, the basement where it all began looks so pedestrian!)The whole Wendy drama was a bit much & at the end-- SPOILER ALERT-- I really thought Kara should have been disqualified or penalized more heavily for the way she cheated with the shoes. It's tough to make Wendy look sympathetic but Kara did that with the way she handled the shoe issue. Wendy called her out and she was spot on. I don;t think Kara would have been allowed to get away with this on later shows. But I guess since Jay won it was a mute point. Tim did his best to level the playing field--and the show must go on. If you want to see its ""rough"" beginnings, this Season is a hoot and well worth the money."
5,Work for my Sunbeam Microwave Oven,I need this bit set to open my microwave oven so that I can change the fuse. The best fit one is T-20.For people with negative review about the quality of this product: I (and neither do many other people) do NOT have a chance to try the high-end bit set. Nor do we use it everyday. This is simply the best option available if you don't know the exact size of torx. It's the cheapest and fastest delivery.
3,THE COLD SMELL OF THE WISPERING STONE,"wELL, i REACENTLY WAS TURNED ON TO gEORGE cHESBRO BY HIS OBIT IN THE WASHINGTON POST.i HAVE READ FOUR OF HIS FIRST MONGO BOOKS AND i'M HOOKED.i HAVE FIVE MORE ON ORDER.i'M A BIG FAN OF LAWRENCE bLOCK AND f.pAUL wILSON AND MONGO SEEMS TO BE A NATURAL FOLLOW UP.wINSTON wORLEY"
1,I'd love to say this was a great game...,"...however it doesn't load.Like the previous comment, I can get the game loaded but the scenarios never load. I tried letting the computer run all night in an effort to load a scenario, but to no avial.Something is obviously wrong. At first I though it was my computer. I tried to run it on the other three computers in the house with the same results.The patch has been of no use.I'm just grateful to find out there is nothing wrong with my computer.***addendum***I exchanged the game for another copy of the same game. The results were the same.So there is something obviously wrong with the program."
2,Sound quality SUCKS!,"The features are ok (2 folders for recordings and mic Hi/ Low sensitivity and all)But it has no on/off switch so prepare to keep that extra pair of batteries handy.Also, if you like GOOD sound quality in recordings DON'T BUY THIS!Unless you need this for basic reminders like grocery lists then it may work for you.But on the other hand if you would for instance; like to record a college lecture or something buy something else. The sound quality SUCKS!Those old cassette recorders work and sound better."
1,Yow! What's with the reverb????,"Nothing else to say-- it doesn't matter how good the sound started out. Once it gets junked up with artificial echo, it is destroyed beyond salvation. Foul! Boo!! Hiss!!!"
4,A Mighty Collection,"This CD is collection of singles that makes an excellent introduction to this spacey band of the 90's. Highly innovative, Man or Astroman defies categorization or explanation!"
2,Lemon,This thing is not easy to use. To scan accurately you have to go so slowly it would be much quicker to type. If you are lucky to get an error free scan then it is nearly impossible to use it with any other software
1,Wizcom Pen Disappointing,"The pen rarely is accurate. The pen does not link to the computer well when working in word. I have to go over the line four or five times to get it to read in word. The desktop application is not very user friendly. When attempting to replace the batteries, the pen did not take the AAA batteries I used. Both the batteries that came with it and the ones I replaced them with were duracell, and the replcement batteries did not fit. They were too small. I had to squeeze the back of the unit to get power and then it did not stay on. Overall, I thought the pen was not worth the money and is virtually useless."
2,Just more of the same stuff...,"I had heard of this guy and his band and thought I would give it a listen. I heard more of the same stuff that everyone is doing these days and was a little disappointed. I want to hear something new, where are the new creative ideas?????"
1,The album cover is the best part,"I was very disappointed with this release. Kullervo's Funeral March and the Sinfonietta are particularly uninspired, despite BIS's usual fine production values. Kajanus (1856-1933) was an influential conductor who should have kept to his baton instead of his pen. Those looking for Nordic bypaths should try Stenhammer or Tveitt."
5,Perfect kit for Nikon D200,"I'm using the lenses as a backup for my Nikon 18-200 lens. If you are looking for an accessory kit for your D200, then this the one. You will not be disappointed."
1,Sadly disappointed,"Very concisely put, I was looking forward to a further discussion, analysis, or revelation a la The Cosmic Serpent, which I enjoyed immensely. This book wanders randomly, never settles on a definition of ""knowledge"", recapitulates peripherally interesting science, but never really integrates those tidbits back to DNA, our connection to the wisdom of nature, or how we might approach interfacing with that wisdom or ""knowledge"" in a new or more accessible form. Once his premise, of an intelligent nature, is accepted (or not), there is no interesting direction or depth presented. Very disappointing."
3,Attractive Piece of Furniture,"Sound is good, not spectacular....buttons are extremely hard to read they are just engraved in the brass should have been made much clearer to the consumer to see, and NO REMOTE CONTROL...which is the worse thing about this sterro system...Overall look and sound is good, but I would have not purchased if I knew no remote and hard to read buttons!!! I kept the system ...since the price was really good and didn't want to hassle sending it back!!!!"
4,Nostalgic Stereo System,I love it! I have an huge collection of the 'old records' and it is difficult to find an easy way to play them. This is perfect for me - does not take up alot of space and looks & sounds great.
3,Was Defective As Delivered,"I liked the way it looked. However, the CD changer would not even open, and would make a loud racket when you pushed the open button. It wouldn't stop without turning off the unit. Everything else seemed to work and sounded fine."
2,Looking Great is as Far as It Gets,"I purchased this stereo over a year ago because it looks very nostalgic, plays records, and it had a good sound. It worked great for a little over a year but when Christmas came, and I tried to play CD's, the CD player didn't open. I had two CDs in the CD player and I had to take the entire CD player apart in order to get my CDs. The CD player plays the CDs but the mechanism to open the compartment no longer works, so that doesn't help matters at all. It's real disappointing because again, it is great looking, but I also wanted function and dependability. Not something I have to dispose of within a year."
2,fit is off,I tried out this carrier today. I never bothered to put my daughter in it. I couldn't get the straps adjusted well enough to make me feel comfortable putting my daughter in it.
2,"Comfortable for child, painful for us","We bought it from ToysRUs using a price match from Diapers.com for the same price as Amazon. Our 2 year-old son weighing under 30 lbs was happy and comfortable, but I can't say the same for us. Both my wife and I felt the same way: As soon as we put it on, we felt tugging and strain on our shoulders, chest, and upper back. We adjusted the straps to make the pack as close to our backs as possible, but it was still quite painful. We are both 5'7"" - 5'8"".We bought the Kelty TC 2.1 from CraigsList, and right away, it felt so much better.I'll definitely be returning the Chicco to ToysRUs."
3,Not Worth The Money,"My husband brought this backpack for me to carry our 11 month old daughter in because the Evenflo Cross Terrain Carrier is too heavy for me. Unlike the Evenflo Cross Terrain Carrier this Smart Support Backpack does not have any place to store diapers, wipes, bottles and the rainhood. Lack of storage space is the reason that it's not worth the money. I believe I'll keep looking for a backpack that is functional and lightweight."
2,"So much for the ""comfort"" feature","I am 5'5, 200lbs, and have a long torso. This backpack was a good length for me and yes, it is lightweight. Unfortunately, behind the lumbar support is a big, fat, plastic bar that slips past the lumbar support and dug into my back and pelvis. It was really uncomfortable. I tried to adjust the lumbar pad several times but to no avail. I'm also confused as to why the blue pack is more expensive than the red one.Needless to say, we will not be keeping this backpack."
4,Good but the bosch is better,"Price is excellent on amazon, but lets face it bosch and hilti make the best sds bits. This bit lasted about 2 months before dulling out and eventually breaking. I still have bosch's from 2 years ago. Due to the nature of the abuse my company puts these through, and price, it still gets 4 stars. If you have a choice go with the viper cold chisel from bosch."
3,Wanted: better writing and editing,"I enjoy Op-Center books, but Call to Treason was a major disappointment. The plot was not as rich and clear as usual, but it was the unsatisfactory writing and editing that caught my eye. It made the conversations very stilted.One basic need was to be consistent with contractions. Or the lack thereof. In one paragraph, a character will speak normally (meaning acceptable for the character and situation), and in the next sentence, the same character doesn't use any contractions. Far too much of this.Rovin is a good writer, but in this book he doesn't grasp the culture and lingo of the characters in his book. I'm hoping his next Op-Center book shows improvement. I'll bet it does."
4,Good Basic Information.....but......,"I have dabbled in gardening for years, but have decided to go all out this year. This book did help me alot with what I should be doing each month for my plants and other yard work. However, I guess I was expecting more out of this book. Although it does give good basic info,I really needed something a bit more indepth in regards to plants that are specifically for my region of Pennsylvania."
4,It works.,"I was in that weird ""I should buy everything on Amazon"" mood when I bought this. You can get them cheaper at Target or another local store. It works fine for what it is."
4,Beach Boogie Blues!,"I love this CD! Johnny Hoy and the gang are an absolute blast, with boogie tunes like ""Love Dog"" and ""Howlin' at my Darlin'""...what a fun CD - bravo!!!"
1,life or death.. i think i'll choose death,life or death.. i think i'll choose death. by suicide if some one plays this crap c.d. (read Crap Disc) again.
1,Therapeutic Helmet Buffing,Check out the cover photo. Look at how C Murder is positioned. He's waiting for his mostly male fans to administer fellatio to him. Go ahead and buff his helmet. That's what he wants and you CM fans want to do it too. Just stop being so shy about your innermost desires. You'll all feel a whole lot healthier and a lot less violent if you guys would just admit what you wanna do and then go on and do it. It's okay. It's the 21st century and society isn't going to judge you for it anymore.
5,As relevant today as it was way back then! A masterpiece in thought.,"Considered one of Aristotle's best works, it discusses virtues. Aristotle focuses on the importance of continually behaving virtuously and developing virtue rather than just committing good deeds. He emphasizes the importance of ""context"" to ethical behavior - for example, what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another."
4,Great DVD!,Can't go wrong with Sesame Street! Bought 4 for our various nephews & nieces and they love it!
3,smaller than I thought,"24 ounces is smaller than I thought. so i use it when it's just two of us, but I had wanted something for serving three or four."
4,Exellent Sophmore Dance Release,"I first heard previews of the disc on their official site.I was really impressed.Im really glad i bought the disc.Its now one of my favs.If you like Stacey Q,Dead or Alive,or Massive Ego this cd is for you.Contains covers of Bananaramas's ""Wild Life"" and Apollonia 6's ""Sex Shooter"" pinned by Prince.Cant wait to hear more from this group."
2,You will finish the book,"I had to finish it- even though I knew exactly what would happen. He grabbed me at the beginning and I looked forward to reading my book every night. Then, he just lost me and I found Acts of Faith to be predictable and at times, boring. The religious aspect, traditions, rituals... were all interesting, however, the storyline became long and drawn out. I could see why some might like it but personally, I need a few more twists and a bit more excitement. It's another book to put on the shelf that may or may not be a conversation piece one day."
5,A spell writer's dream come true!,"This is an excellent book. It contains corrospondances for everything! Includes herb, stone, tree, and deity references for writing spells for any and everything."
4,Good Looking Shoe. Comfortable.,This is a good looking shoe. It's Comfortable. It seems to hold up well. the Material is a little bit plasticky. I guess it's waterproof. the cushioning is good.
2,not worth the price,"bought blue version based on reviews here, despite the high price compared with other plastic or silicone-type cases on Amazon. First of all have to state it looks nice. the material it is made of is not silicone and not hard plastic either, but in between. it is more of a vinyl-like material. I had a hard time getting it onto the phone, almost too hard, thinking I might almost damage the phone putting it on. there is a conspicuous mold seam running around the edge of it....but the main issue I have with it is that it covers the volume and power buttons, making them hard to push, and with this stupid phone the only way to wake it up is to push the power button, so you will be pushing this material lots and lots over the power button. they should have left the buttons uncovered, seriously, as this makes the phone harder to use."
3,Good protection for my HTC Desire,"Lots of my friends consider that using this protection for my phone makes the phone ugly, but i like it, and it offers great protection for the phone, i dropped it lots of times and i don't have to worry, when i take the protection off, the phone is good as new."
4,AN EXTRAORDINARILY TALENTED SONGSMITH,"Whatta life! From poverty to great wealth based on musical talent of creating songs as well as a wonderful actor. He had many highlights writing songs and acting but after rock & roll took over the musical scene his talents went for nothing as no youth were interested.Mr. Sudhalter covers Hoagy's entire life and an interesting one it was. The writing in many places is of a ""text book"" nature, but the content of relating Hoagy's life puts the reader in the center of life as it existed in the 20's through the 60's. Apparently Hoagy's type of music is gone forever which is a loss without question. New generations continue on and what was usually stays behind as merely history."
4,Indiana Boy,"Hoagy Carmichael grew up poor in Indiana, but he managed to get himself into Indiana University where his writing and playing piano made him many friends, many better off than he was. The book offers the reader a vivid picture of life in the American Midwest back when jazz musicians, both black and white, mixed, and when there was no prejudice. It is also a fascinating saga of a poor boy who became rich and famous in Hollywood, and along the way wrote some of America's most popular songs, many set in an imaginary Southland he never visited. Carmichael was one of the first white men to capture the spirit and soul of black music, a gift that Gershwin envied and Louis Armstrong, who recorded many of his songs, admired. As is the case of most rags to riches Hollywood stories, this one ends very sadly. His songs, however, will live on forever."
2,"Flimsy, Not Worth The Money.",I was very dissatisfied with this product. It is very flimsy and doesn't stay on good (especially older tub faucets).
3,Less Than Expected,"I had read this novel some 20 years ago, and remembered it well. However, upon a second reading, I thought much less of it."
2,Your Kidding me Right?,"I first read this in high school when it first came out. I decided to read it again just in case I read it too fast 25 years ago. The hero is just too perfect. I mean he doesn't even have interesting emotions, insights or flaws.Dig this: The guy is a perfect lover, has the best ageless genes, with a mind of a genius and looks like a hunk? Oh and get this- he learned Basque from a book while in prison. I mean this guy is 007 with Mata Hari thrown in.It was an airport thriller when I bought it. After trying to read it the second time, I realized there is a template for an airport thriller. I read it around the same time I read Leon Uris' Exodus. The latter stayed with me forever."
5,Shibumi Is a Stellar Novel,"I first read Shibumi quite young, and was taken with its ""effortless perfection""; I have read it many times since. I attribute my interest in Eastern culture to this book."
4,"'Shibumi' is a compelling, tightly-written novel.","'Shibumi' wraps the reader in an invisible cover of deafness to the outside world so that they are whisked along the storyline without remembering that they have turned the pages. The character development and historical perspective are revealed in such a manner that one feels that they have met the characters in real life and developed a sense of them over time.A score of '8' may not seem like much for a work that was enjoyed as much as this one, but I have given very few authors/novels this score. None have received a '9' or '10'.This is one of the few books I have read twice. All would be advised to give this book (and themselves) a good try. You may be surprised at what you discover."
1,Awful disappointment.,"Terrible book. Everyone in the book dies and the hero is planning to kill himself by the end. All the action is ""off stage"": Hero walks behind a curtain with a comb, bad guy is dead. Then he walks behind the curtain with a credit card, another bad guy is dead. Great build ups to no pay off. Hero becomes a ""Go"" expert: Never plays ""Go"" again in the book. Just a bunch of grandiose wish fulfillment by the author. It does have a great caving sequence. (like the nice moutain climbing in his last book.) If you must get the book read the chapters about the caving. They stand completly alone very well without bothering with the nonsense of the rest of the book. Over all a very depressing read."
5,"shibumi: a novel, kindle version",I have read this novel many years ago and have just purchased it in my Kindle version. I found it to be as good as I remembered. I like Trevanian's works a lot and will reread his others.
4,A nice yoga workout,"This is my favorite yoga DVD. It is very calming while still providing a strong work out. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is the heavy reliance on the use of a strap. My daughter's friend and I nicknamed the instructor ""strap boy"". :-)"
4,read this before going for it,"Statistics and probability are not easy subject matters. You can do a lot to help yourself by solving lots of problems. Thus, if you're taking a course in statistics and/or probability, you should have a copy of this book. In it, you will find a concise, clear review of the theory, followed immediately by many problems with detailed solutions. Nothing is worse than in a math class than getting hung up on some idea during the semester. You will fall behind and probably not catch up. Semester after semester, my students tell me this Schaum's made a positive difference in their understanding."
2,Not enough for the money,"The shows are great and I remember them from my childhood. I wanted my kids to see these shows because they are wonderful learning tools. However, there is only one show on one of these CD's and only two on the others. I know there were a lot more shows from 1974-1979 than that. These DVD's are a rip off. If they had more shows they would be well worth the money."
5,sesame street,Love it! Takes me back to my childhood. Enough full episodes to remeber the feel of 70's Sesame Street and lots of classic cuts.
3,Okay,"We enjoyed the nostalgia, but there were'nt as many episodes as we thought. It's definitely dated, but still wholesome entertainment for our child."
2,For Parents Only,This item is definitely for the parents! My 20 month old loves Sesame Street but he was so bored with the Old School. So much has changed...for the better! I loved it because it was nostalgic but there wasn't nearly enough Big Bird for my little guy.
2,Past its Prime,"I've had my Bose Lifestyle system for many years - since our first Plasma TV. It has worked great (though Bose did replace the hard drive for a small fee).Since a software upgrade a year ago, it now reads and saves disks with MP3 files. It holds much more music than it previously did when it would only rip CDs.The biggest problem with the unit is its lack of support for HDMI and digital audio. My PS3 and AppleTV both use HDMI for video, and either HDMI or Optical cable for audio. The Bose only supports 1 optical input.I got the AppleTV so I could do AirPlay from my laptop, but I really should have looked into an AirPlay compatible receiver.The Bose VS-2 adds HDMI switching capabilities to the Lifestyle receiver, but doesn't touch the audio stream.I really wish I didn't have so much invested in my Bose system. It was great 5 years ago, but it is definitely past its prime now."
2,Hold out for digital re-master,"Good collection, but audio is second rate at best. Hold out for digital re-master."
5,GIVE IT 2 EM RAW,"I've recently started to re-collect my entire No Limit collection since mine was stolen from a car, This is one of the first 3 albums I purchased. It really is a classic. It is also bitter sweet though because Soulja Slim is no longer with us and doesn't get the proper respect he deserves, He was not only one of the best from the South. But in rap period. RIP Slim, You may be gone. But never forgotten!!!"
3,Unheard LP,"I'm a huge SOULJA SLIM fan, but I never heard this CD, I should have because I heard it is his best selling CD, the only song I heard was ""Law Breakaz"" and ""From what I was told"" I hope he got some bangin' tracks like the last 3 CDs Years Later is my #1 CD"
4,awsome game,"This game is very hard. I always have to ask my friend at school. If you buy it get the book! You can get alot of items in this game like hookshot,bow and arrow,bombs, and alot more to get."
5,ANOTHER ZELDA CLASSIC ON GBA ! ! ! ! !,"Great. My first ZELDA game on GBA. I love it. I already got all heart containers/, swords and up-grades, bottles, etc. I've even beaten GANON, but I can't get enough !I always keep playing and playing all over again.Buy this classic now !!"
5,This is the best Zelda Game Ever!,"I love all Zelda games, but this is by far the best. I've bought every Zelda game that's came out! In the previous GBA games I thought it would be beyond awesome if you could link up and see the other guy on your screen. I can't believe it finally happened"
5,Link has returned!,"This game is a remake of the classic Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super Nintendo. It has timeless gameplay, smooth graphics, a wonderful plot, and amazing replay value. I reccomend this game to anybody, whether you be an action gamer of a roleplayer, it's a must have.This is the ultimate gift for any gamer, and with the all-new multiplayer adventure, you might even find some companions to share the game with.You can't go wrong buying this game. Go for it."
5,I've been waiting for this for a year!,Finally! I love this game! I wish that I could play it every waking moment of my life! Go Zelda!
5,The Man!,Fantstic read. I wish a few rumors had been covered in this book. I guess the legal stuff keeps him from doing so thought.Any fan of wrestling or martial arts should read about this man.
3,Switching On: Ok,"This is an older book, the pictures are dated black and white photos making it hard to follow, but the information is interesting."
5,Joby GP2-41EN Clip with Bubble Level,Must have for serious photographers who have the Joby tripods and who want to estimate quickly when their shots might be on or too far off of being level.
3,"Nice tripod for your cameras, but......","I have a finepix HS10(which is a prosumer) and it weighs around 636 grms(batteries not included). I bought this tripod for my camera because the ad says that it loads till 800 grms. And it does!! The only problem is that when you have your camera mounted, it is kind of difficult to manoueuvre the tripod. It looks like the tripod didnt have 100% stability. I recommend using the tripod first, I mean, put it in the position you want, and then mount your camera. I still think it doesn't offer good stability, though."
4,Given as a gift,"Got this for my dad as a Christmas present. He seems to enjoy playing with the legs and says that is seems sturdy and should hold his ""larger/older"" point and shoot with little issue. It seems to be equally as fun as functional, what with the highly varied positions and places it can be used in."
2,Not sturdy enough,"I love the idea of this tripod! The point-and-shoot version works great, but for my Canon Rebel with a heavy lens it is a total no-go. It just can't handle the weight. With a light lens like the prime 50mm, it would probably work fine.One day I set up the camera with my wide angle lens and the tripod actually buckled, my lens broke and it cost more than $200 to repair the lens. I was bummed and at the time wished I had never met the Gorillapod.They may have improved the product by now, but if not, beware if you're hoping to use this with an SLR and a large-ish lens. Just go with a regular, light-weight tripod instead."
2,"Thought I'd use it a lot, but barely do","I really wanted a mini tripod for my SLR, but I don't really like this gorillapod mostly for its (lack of) ease of use. It's more of an inconvenience to set up and get ready to use than I thought. Screwing it on is easy enough, but then the three flexible legs are hard to set up to make the camera sitting atop take a straight shot. Most likely your pic will be at least a little crooked. I haven't tried wrapping the tripod legs around a pole or something because I'm afraid it won't hold the weight of the SLR and slide down (but I'm sure it's designed to hold the weight of an SLR so it can do it -- just me not wanting to try). Basically, it seems like a pain and time consuming to set up and so I rarely, rarely want to use it."
4,Works well,"I bought this Gorillapod for a recent trip to NY. It worked just fine. It is light enough to fit in my back pocket, and it worked well in very different situations (parks, museums and so on). One thing I didn't know is that some pieces may separate from the tripod if too much force is applied, but they can be easily reattached. By the way, my camera is a Panasonic FZ28."
3,Works great unless you try to hold the camera vertically,"For the most part, this is a great tripod. I particularly like that I can bend it to fit in an inconveniently-shaped spot in my camera bag. The removable mount is also nice -- I generally keep it on my camera all the time, so I can just snap it onto the tripod when I need it.It gets only 3 stars, though, for being unable to hold my camera sideways (ie. portrait orientation). The joint between the mount and the central ball needs to be much, much stronger. This isn't a heavy camera -- one of the lighter dSLRs with a prime lens -- which makes me wonder what the ""SLR"" designation is supposed to indicate. Maybe I should have gotten the Zoom version, but I'm not willing to spend $50 to find out."
3,Will NOT hold up an SLR,"This model claims to be able to hold up an SLR, and I would debate what SLR they are discussing. I own a Konica Minolta 5d, and the G-Pod will not hold it up on a flat table. I have a little more luck on railings and branches, but the grip is not confience building.On the other hand, this thing is awesome when holding my Olympus C-5050 rangefinder camera and other slightly lighter cameras. Finally, I have been able to use it to help stabilize my SLR when I have other items to help make it safe, but it is just not robust."
4,flexible tripod,This is a really handy tripod. Holds my camera in many positions and hangs on to all kinds of things.
5,A Must For All Camera Buffs,"Easy to use, easy to carry around, light weight and the best part is that it puts you the camera person back into the picture no matter where you are! It is great."
3,"TimeLife Soul Story is weighted toward older, more R&B songs","This is not a bad collection, and you will no doubt find songs on it that you like but had completely forgotten about, and you will discover new favorites, BUT... be forewarned that, interspersed with the best soul songs from the seventies (which seems to me to be when the best of the best were recorded), there are many, many lesser-known tunes from the fifties and sixties that might be better described as R&B; or blues.I don't mind having some of these older songs, but I would have preferred more of the cream of the crop."
5,Daz is the greatest,"This album is the all time greatest album. If you haven't heard it yet, you GOTTA hear it. numbers 3,4,7,8 are the BEST.check it out cuz you're missin out!"
5,Very good beginner's book!,"I recommend this book for beginners who want a good easy, basic study of the Civil War. Not only for beginners but for others who want to brush up on the war. Easy and simple to understand."
4,"Excellent First CD, worth the purchase!","It's been a few weeks since I bought this CD, and while many of the songs I immediately loved, some took a little re-listening. Now, several weeks later, I am very glad I bought this CD and am quite impressed with The Fray!The nice thing about The Fray is that they have a unique voice and song style. You will not have 25 other CDs in your collection that sound the same as this one, nor are the songs the type of song everyone writes. Since I bought the CD it's pretty much been in my CD player the whole time, can't get enough of it! I recommend buyers take a chance with these newbies!"
3,Kinda bland...,"A really good friend of mine recommended this CD to me and I bought it on that recommendation. I didn't know if I should listen to him though, as I knew we have different tastes in music - mine being a little edgier.I was pleasantly surprised....at first. The first couple of songs were really tight and fun to listen to...then it just got boring. I don't have anything bad to say about the rest of the CD, but nothing good either.I think if I was a wide-eyed teenager, I might really like this. But being a jaded and tainted adult, it just really didn't do it for me.Recommended for the younger crowd. Over 30? Skip it."
5,The best thing to come out of Denver,"Yes, The Fray is a CO band. Considering Colorado is the most boring place you could ever live (believe me, I've been here all of my life), it strikes me as amazing that a band that people are saying is the next big thing to hit airwaves came from here.Yes, being from Denver, I was one of the lucky ones who got wind of this band first. When ""Over My Head"" was first a local music single played on the alternative station at the beginning of last summer, it automatically hooked me in- it is to this day compelling enough to where it is STILL one of my favorite songs almost a year later. The Fray is a compelling band with oodles of talent and an amazing CD- I am proud to be one of the first Fray fans."
4,THE FRAY,I really love this music. I like the meloncoloy of the words and how they both mesh together to make this lovely to listen to songs. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys light rock/alternative music.
4,scrubs episode,"the previous post said on the latest episode of scrubs that over my head was the song played at the end, when it was actually how to save a life, come on know your facts"
5,Beauty,"Awesome! Got the free single of the week from iTunes (Over My Head) and immediately scooped the album. It really is amazing. Yeah, a mix of coldplay and counting crows, with the lyrical talent of Death Cab for Cutie. It's sweet, no question. I cant wait for the next album. Though I might be waiting a while, hehe. Hopefully the strenght of this album will push them to release a second soon."
2,Nothing new.,"Yes they have some catchy tunes, but this record is unbearably unoriginal. This music is best suited for a tv drama, rolling in during the scene where the doctor makes a grand effort to save both the mother and the infant in a complicated pregnancy, only to come so close but one dies (in fact I think scrubs had a similar scene); or when the teacher tries so hard to turn her no-good students straight, but one of them ends up dying right after they shape up. I don't much like their music."
4,Soundtrack Is Great!,"I don't own the soundtrack, but I have spend countless hours on the game, And this is NOT video game music. An entire band must be playing it, with no computer help!"
5,My brother LOVED!,I ordered this as a surprise Christmas gift for my brother! He absolutely loved this and was shocked I was able to find the old school Dukes! Would highly recommend!
5,FINALLY A DUKES SERIES ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!,LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT. REALLY HAPPY THAT THE SERIES CAME OUT ON DVD. FINGERS CROSSED MORE EPISODES/SERIES GET RELEASED!!!TV IS JUST NOT THE SAME WITHOUT THEM ANYMORE!
1,"Awful, hateful, unfun...","I'm not entirely sure why I bought this - despite what I thought, it is not featured on the excellent website"
5,This game rocks!,"I was let down by the movie, but the game makes up for it. You can play as either a ""Dragon Slayer"" or the actual Dragon itself.As a human, you take the role of a resistance fighter, controlling a variety of well-equipped vehicles. Your purpose is to defend the last remaining humans from attack and eventually to make your way to the site of the sole male dragon.As a dragon, the player will take the role of an infant led by instinct to attack its foe at any opportunity and attempt to eradicate the human race. The plot follows the maturing of the dragon, gradually getting more powerful, as the game progresses.The sound and graphics are amazing. I really enjoyed playing this game."
4,If I'd only known,"Edit: I meant to put 3 starsI saw the movie and it was good but like the game, not well thought out. Jugdging by the preview the game looked really good and I have to give them credit for that. Otherwise this game was horrible. The graphics were ok for xbox but the controls were just horrible. I really thought it was going to come close to halo but I was sadly dissapointed."
4,hey its pretty good!,well i rented the game for a week it is pretty good. the graphics are pretty good but the game is kinda dark. as for the controls they are preyyt simple. now the bad parts are that there is no 2 player modes. but overall the game is good.
5,Perfect for kids who love Harry Potter,"Great toy for kids who love Harry Potter. It is very authentic and impressive looking, but as safe as any other toy of this type. The multiple sounds are a big plus."
2,no results,I didn't see a difference in weight loss. i would take it before i worked out.I only used it for a week though.
3,"Fun, but slow","I thought the game was fairly fun, but my boyfriend and his friends found the pace really slow! The mini games are incredibly random, but often hilariously random! If you're looking for a girly Mario Party that isn't even remotely skill based, this game might be for you!"
5,Happy Dog!,The doggles have made Snickers enjoy his motorcycle riding. No more dry eyes or dirt to deal with. He thinks he is pretty cool as he does not try to take them off. They work as advertised.
1,written in a hurry.,I assume that's what happened anyway.I am a decent flash coder - and this book confounds me.Not because its too complex because the authors just try and make everything harder than it really is.Multiple code errors - and often you just get snippets followed by plain language.I never use this book.
3,not what I expected,"The opening chapter, in the ""look inside this book,"" is a detailed narrative about a group of men trying to deal with a social situation and to get outside help against the favoritism and bribes being deployed by the opposing side. I was hoping to pursue this narrative to see a micro-history of just how such business does get done, the texture of life, the way things work or don't work. Instead, the narrative ended unfinished at the end of chapter one, and other chapters were much more abstract accounts of sociological issues, including debate with other sociologists; so I was disappointed. Nonetheless, there are some very interesting sections here: on just how different are the ways of thinking about government or the self, or the kinds of marital problems caused (or exacerbated) by migration to the West. In sum, this does offer intriguing anecdotes and insights, but quite different from what the ""look inside"" seemed to promise."
1,Garbage,"Stalinbashing somehow just has got to tie in with the prattle we get in the modern age about<I> ""victory over communism,""</I> whatever that is.I have to believe it somehow relates to the decimation of a peaceful and prosperous Yugoslavia into a wasteland of migration, economic collapse, famine, economic wars and genocide.The victory cries still echo from some pretty strange sources, to and include John Major and Bill Clinton, who should at least be getting the message by now."
4,"Good container, but might be unnecessary.","This sharps container worked perfectly without any problems. However, after looking up my city's garbage collection policies, I found that as long as needles are placed in a hard, puncture proof container with hard screw lid, I can throw them away in the regular trash. So I now recycle some of my containers from other products as sharps containers. Much less expensive! - Morkand"
1,Frustrating,"When I first got this game I was really excited. It's a great idea and, if done right, it could even be my favorite game. But it wasn't. The main reason for this is that in this game, natural disasters (earthquakes, fires, tornados) strike your school about every three or four days. They wreck some of your buildings and you have to give tons of money to replace them. There seemed to be no way to save money. You would think that there would be some option where you could turn disasters off, but I didn't see one, and there's no other way to prevent them. I found myself getting very frustrated and having to reconstruct my school again and again. I would not get this game."
3,LITTERMANIA! by Ryan Davy,"PLEASE! This game would be a total blast if it wasn't for the difficulty. Personly, I expected it to be easy. The moral crises thing is stupid. It seems every month you are having to put more maitanence workers in to fix buildings. The worst part is that if you go bankrupt, you lose your school! There is always waaaaay to much litter and your janitors wil sometimes not clean it up even if they are put right in the middle of a sea of litter. A word of advice, you would be better off buying Rollercoaster Tycoon or Zoo Tycoon. School Tycoon would be for kids who are teenagers and have played lots of other Tycoon games first. It is very hard to get a really good teacher and even if their strictness is only 1, kids will say""My teacher is WAAAAY strict!"" Please remember this review when you next going to buy a Tycoon game."
1,An honest review,"This computer game would be fun... If it didn't freze up every 3 min. I got this as a gift, and couldn't wait to play it, once I had gotten it installed I started to play. It takes awhile to unlock things, and you have a limited budget. You don't have much control over the people, you can send them to the nurse, give them detention, or expel them. After the first few minuets of playing this it froze up, after about a min. I could play again, but this kept happening, Which is why I gave it a 1."
4,O.K. Game,"This game is o.k. It was o.k. because there was always kids goofing off. Now that was not a problem. There is a tornado once every like 10 minutes. You can make students go to the nurse,go to detention or even you can expel tham. It takes me 10 minutes every time to get to the game so watch out."
1,IT STINKS!!!,It is soooooooooooooooooooooo horrible. You think it is so good at first but then it just stops working. It is pretty dumb too because the game no matter what you lose. That's no good. Picture this I'm playing what a fun time then suddenly the darn thing stops working. Please save yourself don' t get this game!!!!!!!
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!,Don't waste your money on this game!!! When I bought this game and brought it home I was very dissapointed with it. Not what I expected. BAD GAME!!!!
5,Regional Folklore of the USA,"By contemporary standards, this book is dated and perhaps a bit politically incorrect and simplistic. But the book is a valuable archive of fascinating folktales, beliefs, and descriptions of regionally-based forms of traditional culture in the United States. Dorson provides a great variety of stories that are well-worth reading, and they could provide the basis for further study. I found it especially interesting how Dorson was showing ways to integrate the study of folklore into the study of history and geography with this collection of materials. I also found this book to be interesting as a resource for gauging how the thinking of social scientists and humanities scholars has changed over the past 30 years. It also provides a great resource for comparing how regional folklore has changed throughout a sort period of time in this nation."
3,Will plastic carrier hold up over time,"Yellow plastic carrier works well, was half the price of a metal one. width of carrier at bottom and u-shaped construction helps hold well for angle carrying going up and down steps. Will it hold up over time in a construction environment ?? Shipping was way too much money !!!"
2,Didn't use it,Bought it thinking it would help my carry my sheets into the house. Ended up carrying them under my arm which wasn't so hard.
1,Unable to get item shipped to address,Had to reorder product after first item was shipped to some unknown place. My address was correct as I received the first item I ordered. I reordered and it was again sent somewhere I don't know of. I have tried two times and received nothing. Will try a third time.
4,"Yep, it works","Not much to say except even with a bad back I was able to carry a single piece of drywall (4x8) at a time comfortably. The tool has room for up to 1.5"" of thickness (three 1/2"" panels).The length of the tool allows you to carry the panel at a height that maneuvers easily through doorways without having to bend at the knees, and the design keeps the panel close to the body saving width (Im a big guy and there is not a lot of room for me and something else going through a door.) It also provides a nice balance to the panel.If I only use it once a month it has already been worth it."
3,a pretty tight cd,"IF YOU LIKE HARD CORE, AND NO LIMIT RECORDS THIS CD WILL WORK FOR YOU.EVEN THOUGH IM NOT A BIG NO LIMIT MUSIC FAN THIS CD STILL WORKED FOR ME. THE BEST TRACKS ARE FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD, I'VE GOT THE HOOK UP, AND KEEP IT REAL WITH YOU."
4,PRETTY GOOD!!!!!,I think was a pretty good game worth the money.I liked the games and I played it with my friend for hours.I liked how you can choose which kind of city you want to be in and the character too. I don't like though how you have to wait for all the other characters to move throuh out the city. That just takes so long! This game is worth the money though!
2,Uhhhh......................wut happened?,"First things first red faction 1 blows away dis game. This game has an extremely short single player, hard to follow plot, and is NOTHING like red faction 1. Now ur tryin 2 stop some dictator named sopot but the plot wuz so boring i dont kno WHY they were fighting against him. Thers no ultor, mars, parker, none of it. Just some weird group of elite soldiers fighting against dis guy sopot. The single player wuz SO boring dat it took me almost 3 months to beat it......and no not cuz its long. I played dis game for bout an hour or 2 when i first got it then shut it off. Then after 3 months i piked it up again and beat it, but the only thing dat kept me playin wher the guns. Its cool havin a grenade launcher/machine gun lik the rangers in black hawk down hav. But otha than dat dont buy dis game. If ur dat intrested in it rent it......youll beat it in dat week anyway."
1,Worst Game I have ever played,This was one of the worst games I have ever played. I warn you DO NOT BUY THIS! The graphics are horrible they are like PS1 graphics. I like the Halo controls where you use two joysticks but I hate the fact that the controllers are inverted. Overall this game is a 0.1 on a scale from 1 to 10.
4,"Great material, great value","Clocking-in at 23 minutes in length - and featuring 4 non-LP tracks - this EP is great value for the money.* ""Grace Under Pressure (edit)"" is a nice remix of the album-track. Amusingly, the sing-along nasty word at the end of the song is bleeped (subtley, I'm happy to report).* ""Switching Off"" is the same as the great album-version.* ""Waving From Windows"" is another understated b-side, very mellow and heartfelt, wonderful.* ""Fugitive Motel (Radio 2 version)"" is a very satisfying take on the ""Cast Of Thousands"" song/single.* ""Grace Under Pressure (live)"" is the jewel of this EP, a 5+ minute version of the song that wraps-up with the sing-along capper, great sound quality and emotion.All in all, well worth the money, their best EP/single yet."
4,Young Black Stallion,"See? I told you I liked the Black Stallion. The horse used in these movies is nothing short of AWESOME! I know the Black Stallion movies were made several years ago, but don't let that stop anyone from at least purchasing one of the the Black Stallion movies. If you don't like it...return it to me!!"
2,Young Black Stallion,"This movie is a classic example of marriage between fancy camara work/good music and scenery, and LOUSY acting/plot. Exciting horse race at end is the only redeeming quality . . . and even THAT is pretty predictable."
3,"Nice pictures, no plot nor story","The movie is much too short to be a real movie, the DVD shows 48 Minutes, that is including the end credits.The pictures and some shots are very beautiful. Beautiful horses, beautiful landscapes. Horse lovers should love this.But besides that the movie has no real content, so don't look for a real storyline, plot or any depth or logic."
3,Great! Really 3 1\2 stars.,"This movie is not like the book at all, but seeing as the book was a bit mature at times, it's understandable. The man who captured the Black, who had escaped as in the movie, had killed someone. This was replaced by a girl running away and quickly turned into a beautiful moving film, with only a little oversentimentality at times. It is incredibly vivid, and the girl who is in it is excellent, although she's a bit awkward acting as an Arab. Supreme! It's a bit less thrilling on small screen, but will do. written by a teen. adult form broken!"
5,SEAMLESS underwire,This product is super and the people who sold it were also excellent in service and performance.
3,Bak to the Future?? 1918 style...,"OK 1914 looked fairly realistic but then comes 1918 and the chorus girls are totally 40's in their hotpants, snoods, and huge red lips.... yikes, abs gorgeous costumes, that lil tap dancer who wowed in circles was most impressive, Mary Martin not so much, and the vocals overproduced and weak.... BUT COLE!!! what an enduring songbook.... surprised how many I knew and from where, ubiquitous sound remains even today, wonderful tribute albeit many life facts dreamily vaporized... gimme some Georgie Cohan or well, maybe DeLovely is my next whistle stop, heard it was night and day comparison.... tooo sooon??? ;}}"
4,too short from 83,if you wanna hear classic too short jam from 83 up til 85 this is for you and every other too short fanatic out there. cause now short dog's played out and nobody's feeling him anymore.
4,I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst game ever. I think it is mean to even think about KILLING animals. It has the worst grafics. Blood goes every where when you shoot a dog with a rocket launcher. once i shot a man and he blew up in blood and gore. The guns are M-16s, roket launchers, pistols, semi automaic paint ball guns, cross bows and 50 caliber guns. I would never buy this game. The animals are Dogs, cats, mice, rabbits, bears, people, hamsters, birds and snakes. ITS TOO VIOLENT AND BLOODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Activision is writing the good reviews!,Don't be fooled by the long detailed and positive reviews. Donna Johnston from NY is listed in the credits of all the Cabela titles as the QA Lead. Why is she giving her review on the games she worked on which you see on every Cabela game? It looks like Activision is paying their employees to write reviews for them. This game has poor graphics and is tedious and boring. There are much better hunting games out there Don't waste your money on their falsely advertized garbage.
3,"Not quite the original, but worth the read","This text was designed to update the results-oriented approach of the author's earlier book, ""offering readers techniques to get more out of each precious minute."" Lakein offers his insights for the future and explains how to pay attention to moments as they come along, treat time as a limited resource, and make the most of every moment. Now, four years since its publication date, the book has not fared nearly as well as one might expect from the genre's godfather."
4,Good for beginner,"This book is really good for beginner. The high quality picture significantly pushing me to own a tortoise.Clear and straightforward presentation for easy understand, although your are very beginner, you can successfully get the basic knowledge.However, you cannot find detail information in this book because it gives general information only. Actually, if you already feed your tortoise more than half year, then this book is not suitable to you."
3,Not great quality.,Unfortunately the base seems to be made out of lightweight plastic. The worst is the lid....it is so light that it bends.
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"This is a very loud blender. If it were used in a workplace, I bet OSHA regulations would require hearing protection. I have to step out of the kitchen or my ears ring afterwards. Seriously. Also, it's a little tricky to put in the blade assembly exactly right and then put the bowl onto the base exactly right -- and if you don't, you'll get a loud grinding sound accompanied by the wonderful smell of melting plastic. Or you'll have a leak and whatever you were blending will spill all over your counter, which is really, really annoying. The blade is not built into the bowl, and the blade is kind of dangerous to clean, although in most cases you can take the lazy way out and use the self-cleaning feature. Overall, this blender does the job and it's relatively inexpensive but it's just not a very well designed piece of machinery. I kind of wish I hadn't bought it."
3,Blender,I like the blender and its size. I do have problems chopping frozen fruit even on the highest speed. I'm still working on different recipes.
3,Tolerable,"I used this for protein shakes. It leaves big chunks of ice and fruit when making smoothies. That's pretty normal for a $40 blender though. I dropped it one night though and shattered pitcher. Everyone raves about the glass pitcher, but give it a year and you'll probably break it too ;) I replaced this with a blendtec - far superior, but 10x the price, so it's really not comparable."
5,excellent product.. no complaints so far,"I have purchased this product b/c of all the great reviews it had received. I can now add my own to it. It works great, have had no problems with it. Very reliable product, and I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of purchasing it."
5,Excellent,"I just bought this and the 15 watt Spider Line-6. This Fender is far cleaner sounding, and had a lot more volume with almost no distortion at all. The Spider Line-6 is way inferior even though it has more bells and whistles. I'm adding this comparison because I bought the Spider Line-6 first, and wasn't pleased with it, so I ended up speanding a second $100 to get this Fender Frontman which I am well pleased with. So if you're comparing these two amps, my vote goes for the Fender by a mile. (although the Fender has reverb only, so if you're looking for a distorted sound then maybe you'll like the Spider Line-6 better). But if you want CLEAN sound and lots of volume without distoration, this Fender Frontman is the way to go! I'm well pleased with it.This also has plenty of volume for actual performances in small places. I can't imagine wanting more volume in a small bar or cafe unless you are trying to hurt people's ears."
4,Loud!,"Sounds great and clean, if you want something to practice, way to go! Not too powerful for gigs, keep this in mind.I don't know if is the amp, but when I turn up the tone controls of my guitar, makes sounds like a fly.Maybe i'm wrong and this is the good guy and the bad boy is the guitar."
5,Super super great for a first amplifier,"This is my first amp i've ever bought for my guitar and i don't know much about the specific specs, but i do know that it sounds good to my ear and it was definitely worth the $100 i payed for. I've plugged in my distortion pedal it works fine as well. No problems yet."
4,Good for the price,"Plenty loud, and good for the price. Useful for playing at home. I probably would not use it for a gig..."
3,Excellent mid-range shampoo,"Looks good, feels good, smells good, does NOT taste good. Overall excellent product for a slightly higher than standard consumer shampoo. I'd recommend to a friend with 'normal' hair. I have light brown, almost blonde hair, with a touch of wave. This shampoo works well.One disclaimer.... If you spend late nights at a smokey club/bar, this product is not going to eliminate that smell in one shower session (with 2x shampooing). I have yet to find a product that does but admittedly haven't looked very hard or spent much money on shampoos."
5,Marvellous achievement!,"Ronald Calinger's writings on mathematics are second to none, and this book is his ultimate achievement. Well done Sir!"
2,I Expected Much More,"This novel was a major disappointment. I finish what I start, but this was painful. I kept expecting it to get better, but it didn't. The premise was very promising, involving people extremely important to the history of the U.S. all together during a not very well known episode of American history. The history was, in fact, interesting, but the characterizations, especially of Lee were downright annoying.I am a fan of the three civil war books, but cannot recommend this one."
