3,Let's fit as many male sexual fantasies into one tale as we can...,"The only person in the family that artist Ross Marteau doesn't shag in this tale is the mother.That's because she died before he got to her. I enjoyed this book. The writing is beautiful, but I was annoyed by how gullible Ross was over and over again.chocolatesleuth.com recommends this book though because it packs a lot of suspense."
5,Another great book by David Lindsey,"I have been reading and re-reading David Lindsey's books for many years. As always, his brilliant brain is evident throughout. Sophisticated, intellectual, Lindsey's imagination takes the reader on a roller coaster ride, and there is no predicting the outcome. The reader will never forget the experience, that much is certain."
4,Good buy,This shoe was comfortable right out of the box. Was lighter than I expected. I'm happy with the shoe.
5,another great fiesta piece,this is another great piece by fiesta.... no complaints here.... i love it and for the price you cannot beat it...
2,Disappointing,"This books tells the story of three separate mountain climbing rescues. While the subjet matter itself if very exciting and interesting, the style of writing served to make these stories almost boring, if that is possible. In light of the absolutely fabulous books ""The Climb"" and ""Into Thin Air,"" both about the 1996 Mt. Everest tragedy, this book is a huge disappointment and completely pales in comparison. Don't waste your money on this one. The only reason I give it a ""4"" out of 10 is because the stories themselves are compelling . Unfortunately, the writing gets in the way. Also, there are factual inconsistencies in the book which any reader can spot, and any editor should have caught."
3,Stable Product,"Although the product does stabilize the shoulder and somewhat limit movement which is needed to heal these injuries, I guess it does what its supposed to do. The problem I have is with the reviews! Honestly how can people over emphasize the great powers it possesses and how they can have their medical problems be limited during their activities. We review products that We buy, and We buy from the reviews of others. So don't completely lie about products, tell it like it is or leave it alone. We'll make our decision's on the real reviews and not the artificial ones."
4,Very interesting,"Interesting book. I think you need to read a couple of others on the subject to really understand where this book takes you. I do understand the mixed opinions on this subject. Try ""Quantum Enigma, Physics Encounters Consciousness"" for a better understanding of the science behind this one."
5,I am brooding.,"I have a new job, a new house, and a new baby daughter.I am very stressed out right now.I am brooding. I can't stop and I'm losing sleep.This album is really helping me cope with it all.Thank you, Mr. Budd, for taking my mind off of things.I'm so glad you didn't really retire."
4,A Real Treat,"The kind of music you might expect to hear played at, say, the Monterey Bay Aquarium. A wonderful blend of synthetic and acoustic instrumentation swirls and loops, but the music always sound human, and expressive. Budd is a master at pulling this sort of thing off, and this recording never fails to brighten my mood. Not quite Ambient, not quite Space Music, not quite New Age, not quite jazz--but quite entertaining, and with a decent dollop of midbass to satisfy audiophile cravings, The White Arcades is a one-of-a-kind musical treat."
5,Simply Perfect,I love this belt. Its heavy duty not flimsy and true to size. Looks just like t does in the picture!
4,Great style!,"This belt is really wide, even though I am pretty long waisted, but what a fashion statement with a black fitted ball gown.I got lots of compliments!"
3,It's a cinch,"Anytime I want to dazzle my everyday wardrobe, I throw on this belt. My only complaint is that I wish the back had a section of elastic so if I gain a pound or 30, I don't have to buy a new one!"
3,Not that great,I usually buy the intertape 5638 gaffers tape from Amazon but it only comes in Black. Decided to try this out because it was white. This tape does not hold very well at all. Even tearing peeling it off the wall I could instantly tell it was not nearly as strong as the intertape polymer group tape.Not sure if I will be able to find a use for this yet as it seems to only stick well to glass/tile
3,Disappointed!,I expected since it was a premium grade tape that this would be a superior product. It does not leave any adhesive behind when removed which is really good. But it didn't hold as well as I expected it would. I will try another company and see if I can find a better quality gaffers tape.
1,A complete failure.,"This review is for the entire bad series.Had potential but was a let down.When I first read about Black Lagoon, and read that it was a story about a group of mercenaries based in the modern world. A grounded tail with no space travel, superpowers or the like. I thought it would be a nice change, and the animation looked good. It did start of good in the first three to four episodes, but then things began to go down hill. Most episodes went no where, other anime did episodes like that. Cowboy Bebop had many, but they were fun and still had meaning behind them. Black Lagoon on the other hand had no point. Then there was the final episodes. What a major disappointment, what were they trying to tell. What was the point of the series. It went no where, the characters weren't interesting, the story wasn't very good. Over all a bad show."
4,MF from hell,"I have seen the Datsuns twice live, both time in small venues, and they are definitely one of the hardest rocking bands I have ever seen (and I have seen hunderds of bands). They were so good the first time I saw them that I just had to go back to see them again just to get the sheer pleasure of seeing a great rock and roll band giving all they have got on stage. Sadly, it is true that this recording does not quite capture their live sound, as often happens with great live bands such as the MC5 (that is why I am only giving four stars). Having said that, some songs on the CD come pretty close (e.g., Freeze Sucker, which is the highlight of their live shows). Live, the three guys in the front play like MFs from hell. The only weak link in the band appears to be the drummer. Although he is not a bad player at all, he seems to be lacking in power, which also shows on the CD. Overall, however, I strongly recommend this CD. And you MUST see them live!!"
2,It'll Wear Off Sooner Than You Think.,"Datsuns. Oh Datsuns, why is there so much press on these guys? This CD/DVD package has one great song ""MF From Hell"" and the rest is sub-standard and filler. The DVD shows just how pre-meditated their stage personas are. If this band was performing in your favorite local pub, it'd be a nice treat..but they are not venue material. You'll be using the CD jewel case as a coaster more than you'll ever listen to this in the long run."
2,Not very good quality,"It actually works. It makes pasta. But, I don't see the point in having a separate piece for cutting the spaghettis, it keeps sliding off place. Also, under the pasta maker there are four screws that keep getting loose for some reason and coming off. I already lost one and so the piece that it was supposed to be holding is now loose. I bought this machine less than two months ago and I must have used it about 6 to 8 times so I would say it's not very good since it's falling apart. I had a similar one before, different brand, and I used it for years without any problems."
4,Works like I expected,"This is what I expected, however one of the non-slip pad screws was inside machine because the outter nut came off of the screw that came through the pad. The machine rattles because of the screw. Since it was a bargain at under $20, it was something I could live with. I didn't care for the main recipe as I prefer my grandmother's. 3/4 cup semolina flour to each egg- don't forget salt too. Let the dough rest in a plastic bag for at least 30 minutes in fridge and the roll will be smoother. Remember, never wash and dust with flour if any sticking.I would buy again."
1,--1 STAR FOR THE RE-MASTERING,"Although this is one of the best cycles out there, the remastering job DG did on it does more hurt than help (in my opinion).You get quite a bit of digital edginess throughout it, and a loss of the natural warmth and wonderful bloom from the original recordings.It's very difficult to prove this in a review but if you compare the original recordings to the re-mastered versions, you'll begin to see what I'm saying.Mind you, I love Karajan and his '63 Beethoven cycle (I give it 5 stars!), but I would say, stay with the original recordings in the gold and red box set...plus the packaging is so much more beautiful and is perfect for shelf display!"
4,Wonderful Read,"When I purchased this book, I did so for Kinley Macgregor's story only, which I found to be just as wonderful as all her other stories. She is truly a gifted writer. But I also found two other authors whom I hadn't branched out and read any of the their works yet. I have to say that I've gotten just a taste of what they have to offer and I plan on finding more of their works and reading of their stories as well. I was very pleased with this book and happy I took the time to search for it on Amazon."
2,Jake deserves more,I was so disappointed with the LIsa Kleypas portion of this book. Jake Linley deserved more. Craven's daughter deserves more than this silly novella.
1,yummy men goodie,very good characters and stories and exspecialy Sherillyn Kenyons story about stryder
2,Need to include inseam length,"I have purchased several pair of Russell athletic shorts in the past, and felt comfortable ordering another pair. I was surprised that the length of these shorts was well below my knee, about 4 inches longer than I prefer. If the ad had stated a 8"" or 10"" inseam, I never would have bough them"
3,hard to believe,I purchased 2 pairs for my husband and after washing the navy pair shrank considerably.
2,BAD PICTURE,THE PICTURE OF THE RUSSELS SHORTS APPEAR TO BE ABOVE THE KNEE IN LENGTH. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY ARE TO THE KNEE AND SOME WHAT BELOW. NOT WHAT THE PICTURES SHOWS.
3,Way too big and too long for size,These things are sized wrong I bought 3 of these and three Champion Brand. The Russells are way too long and too wide. But they are a good price and quality is OK. I am going to send them back and try a smaller size
1,Waste of money,"If you have basic understanding of accounting, you won't learn anything from the book."
4,"Loads of fun, but way outdated.","If you enjoy classic gameplay, this might be the game for you.This game reminds me of a turn baised version of Close Combat 1-4. If you enjoy military simulation gameplay, you ought to pick it up.The graphics defuallt at 1280 x 960, 60hz; but are auto adjusted."
5,Soul and Inspiration,"For a few years now I have enjoyed Klezmer music but have experienced it as essentially a secular Jewish art form. Even lipservice to religious songs have sounded subservient the demands of the Klezmer style. To describe this album simply as religiously inspired klezmer would be a misrepresentation. Yes I can hear influence of rock, bluegrass and classical music from these highly accomplished musicians. But most of all I hear the soul of the Chassidisher niggun, the broken heart of someone who yearns for the closeness of their G-d, and this is where this music in my estimation is coming from."
3,"Good, But...","Works good, but battery drains quickly. Don't expect it to cut long, thick, or wet grass. Mine worked fairly well for a year or two, now I'm about ready to go back to gas because this just doesn't have enough power."
1,Failed to Deliver on its Promise,"I bought this mower last year in an effort to show a little environmental consciousness and also to spare the neighbors of at least one of the inevitable drones of summertime mowers. What a mistake. I received the mower in broken condition. It took a month to get a new one. That mower broke within 1 1/2 months. I had to drive two hours to the service center to get it fixed. It came back, mowed a few times, and I stored it for the winter (according to its instructions). Spring rolls around and it is time to mow. Guess what? The battery will no longer take a charge.As far as mowing prowess, it suffers from many of the things that the other reviewers have noted. However, I could easily have dealt with those problems-- maintenance problems, however, are a show-stopper.I'm writing Black and Decker and demanding a refund. This is the worst purchase I have made in 31 years. Save yourself the anguish and buy a nice GASOLINE mower until someone makes a reliable electric one."
4,only ONE problem,It is a great mower EXCEPT that the plug for the battery charger is flimsy. I do not know if it is just a guy thing but both my grandson and my husband just pull the connection out instead of depressing the little clip. Both times they broke the plug and at $40 each time it has been very expensive! A different type would be appreciated.
1,consider what UPS will do to it before you get it,"The mower may be nice. I don't know. Amazon justships it in the box you would buy it in at aregular store. It's just a cardboard box with noprotection whatsoever. Mine arrived with the keybent, the wheels out of alignment, and the starterswitch broken. I saved $...by buying it throughamazon.My advice: pay the extra $...and get one that works"
4,mr.quiet,"This is my second electric mower. It out preforms the firstgeneration of mowers in every aspect.It mowes close towhat a gas mower would, except much quieter."
4,Great Mower,"I've been using a corded electric mower for 7 years and loved it except for the cord. I had read good things about the Black and Decker cordless electric mower and ordered one from Amazon.com. The first time I mowed was a little disappointing. Due to the battery it is heavier than my old mower plus, my grass was pretty tall so I had quite a bit of trimmings left behind. But, after that I was in love. I can mow my entire yard and still have battery left. Changing the cutting height is a snap, it's easy to empty the bag and it's a quiet mower. I've adjusted to the weight and don't mind mowing the yard. Plus, it's great in the fall for picking up and mulching leaves. As I watch neighbors struggling to start their gas mowers, lugging gas home and changing spark plugs I just smile and press one little lever and I'm mowing. I highly recommend this mower."
4,buying my second CMM1000,"I have really enjoyed my CMM1000. After six years, it is falling apart and I am buying a second one."
1,Arrived with loose nuts and bolts - never started,"When this mower first arrived, I found two nuts and bolts loose in the carton. I examined the mower carefully to see where these might fit, and failing to find any such place, I proceeded to charge the battery. After about two or so days of charging, I took it out for a mow - It would not start! - I called customer support at B&D; - and the best they could do was to suggest that I return it to Amazon.To Amazon's credit, the return went off without a hitch - all I needed to do was to repack the mower - Amazon arranged for a UPS pickup right from my house, and refunded me the full amount - including shipping."
4,Black & Decker 19-Inch 5 HP Cordless Rear Bag Mower,Two years and I'm Happy. There is no Gas and no electric cord!Just I do not like so long at least 15 houres chaging
3,Battery life is far shorter than advertised,"Black and Decker claims that this mower can mow 1/3 of an acre on a single charge. However, I have found it to be more like 1/8 of an acre (my lot is 1/4 of an acre; I can only mow half of it before the battery dies).Other than that, this mower is great. It runs smooth, cuts well, and pushes easily. So, if you have a very small yard, or don't mind splitting up your mowing over a couple of days, this mower is for you."
2,B&D electric mowers,I purchased a CORDED B&D rear-bagger late last Summer shortly after moving to a new home with a small Bermuda yard. I found major problems:1. The need for a flip handle. Avoiding the cord was a real problem even though I have used electric mowers before. This one was poorly designed.2. The mower left lots of stragglers; did not cut smoothly.3. The blade left circular burned areas in the grass.
2,Eh...,Not the best book on the topic but not a total waste. The chapter on Disks and File Systems is pretty good and is what I've used most in the book. Its helped me a number of times.
1,This book is a joek,"I bought this book a couple of years ago, needing to get up to speed on AIX. I've never touched it since, it's mostly filled with screenshots of smit screens - and very little info.If you really want to learn AIX, get general unix admin with AIX specific's from O'Reily's SysAdmin book, and fill in the rest with the free and excellent pdf's from IBM. (redbooks.ibm.com)Do NOT buy this book"
4,Welcome taste relief in my diet,"I picked this up at the store after reading mixed reviews online. I am on a diet that is low calorie, sugars, and carbs; I've been missing a lot of foods as per usual so I was hoping that this would mix it up. Well it did.When you pick it up you can see that it is runny, which is a con in my book, but the flavors are pretty spot on. I added some extra seasoning like cayenne, paprika, and a pinch of salt. Possibly cooking it down would make it a bit thicker.If you're expecting some awesome hearty bbq sauce, this isn't it, but its a good substitute. I will definitely be finishing the bottle and would buy again. (The 4/5 is for runny factor)"
2,Does it sound like Celine?,"This certainly didn't turn me on at all, the only thing that came back to me is a need to throw up. Not only is the song taken too fast in the remixes, they all sound the same! Please, I am a die-hard Celine Dion fan, and this was a MAJOR waste of money! It would be in all the fans interests to not buy this single."
1,Do not buy this CD if you want the original ballad!!,"The other customer comments on this page refer to the original ballad. This is not what you will hear on this CD. What you will hear is five shrieking,hip-hop dance mixes of this song....absolutely terrible and unreturnable. So take my word and do not buy this CD!"
1,useless...,This is a completely useless purchase. Being hit with a paintball doesn't hurt. Buying this is just waisting your $$$.
3,Solutions are for problems on the book's website,"This solutions manual does not provide answers to the questions at the end of each chapter of the fluid mechanics book; instead the solutions correspond to the Review Problems section on the book website. There are around 15 problems worked out per chapter, all of which are easy to follow and understand. This book is a good reference to have but for me isn't worth the money since it doesn't help me work through my homework problems."
5,boobs,"Boob close ups, jiggling boobs, bouncy boobs, nipples, more boobs, more boobs, and some additional boobs for good measure. I don't think you'd be buying this for special effects or a clever plot, or really any other reason than boobs. There aren't any redeeming qualities to this other than boobs."
4,Connee Boswell - Heart and Soul,"Marvellous songs - but since the recordings are respectively old, the sound quality is not the best, sadly enough. But ""Heart and Soul"" is one of my all time favourites .... So the CD is worth buying."
4,Bright and Colorful,"This is a bright and cute collar. It's a little difficult to snap shut, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars."
2,Unnecessary Measures,"The Amazon reviews prepared me for a good CT/HRT thriller. Sadly, on Page 5 ""Jaffe checked his Glock 22 as if it were a toy. The click of the twenty-two round clip sliding home..."" Glocks, like most other modern semiautomatic pistols, have magazines not clips. Barlog should know the difference; most of his readers will. They may also know that the standard Glock Model 22 magazine holds 15 not 22 rounds. Even so, I continued to read, still rich in hope...until Page 9. There, ""Brax pulled his Glock-clicked the safety off."" Glocks don't have manual safeties that are 'clicked off'. One doubts an author who makes 3 significant mistakes about common weapons in the first 9 pages. Will he do better with the more complex technologies of terrorism bound to be encountered later in the book? I will never know. Technical competence is as important as literary skill for thriller writers."
4,Not for everyone,Barlog is an excellent writer. He obviously knows the subject matter and he keeps you turning the pages until the end. I was a little disappointed with the lack of action and found the story line fairly predictable. But it's an enjoyable ride to the finish and would make a great movie. If you like cloak and dagger fiction this is definitely a must read. I highly recommend it.
4,Good Answers,A friend recommended this book as a resource for a relative seeking answers to questions regarding salvation. We were not disappointed.
5,Sauceboat,"Shipping was timely, and the color was true to the image on my computer. It matched the dishes from Pier One almost perfectly."
3,The Christmas Hope,"The Christmas hope movie is by my perception expected to be based on a series of three Books based on characters from Christmas Shoes and Christmas blessing and new characters. The movie is just o.k for me. I read the books first before viewing the movies. I was disappointed on how the movie was not true to the books, the actors were different from the previous movies and did not even fit the physical description of the other books and stories. The story was a bit changed. For example, in the book:Emily is five years old and not nine.Justin is a lot younger and story line is completely different in the book.I do not want to spoil the plot for other viewers, so I will end this review with this. In the movie, no way is Nathan's dad, step mom, and the lawyer is mentioned. Important characters in the books. I highly recommend reading the books vs seeing the movies. Books are much more detailed and beautifully written."
3,More of a 3.5 rating for this one...,"My son and I raced through this book (on separate but concurrent tracks). While he enjoyed it thoroughly, he was disappointed at the turn at the end. I must admit that I was a bit let down, too. The advantage of reading the book together, tho, is talking about it. In the discussion following our reads, we both made peace with the story. It is really a lovely story about truth, friendship, and courage--as well as a fun spin on the Arthur legend. I would not recommend it for kids who love knight/dragon/adventure books, unless they were thoughtful readers or have a thoughtful guide."
5,Excellent read !,"A real eye opener of how things were in the Great Depression, prohibition & how many public figures were on Luckys payroll; all the way up to Presidentional candidate Dewey. This is no doubt the best mob book I ever read. Hollywood should make a ""Goodfellas"" movie about Charley Lucky."
2,False Testament,"This book was long ago dismissed by many Mob authorities as a fake. It is a good one, very entertaining, and reads like the typical self-serving memoirs of a notorious criminal, along with the imaginative Hollywood flourishes of Gosch, but is filled with errors the real Luciano would not have made unless he was senile. Credibility is somewhat enhanced for the novice organized crime buff by Hammer's research but unless and until the interviews turn up ""The Last Testament"" must be regarded as more fiction than history."
2,Last Testament of Lucky Luciano,"After reading this book I come to realize that the author was trying to sell a movie as well as a book. I find his description of lucky's first meeting with Lepke suspicious, because of the way Lucky describes ""his arms were bulging out of his sleeves"" It has never been written any where that Lepke was physically imposing. I also find it hard to believe that Bugsy Siegal was taken serious at the age of 14, if you figure out the timelines he would have been a young teenager! Its unfortunate but I feel that a lot of this book is total fiction!"
1,Price,How the hell can this game be over $100????? I have the other two and I paid no where NEAR this amount.... what gives?
2,Marley meets Home Alone?,"This movie is pretty much Home Alone 4 (or 5, or whatever its up to) but with a dog. I think they are trying to capitalize on the popularity of the Marley movie (even the DVD covers look similar!)Zeus the dog is an ex-police K9 turned pound puppy who gets taken home by a family at Christmas. The dad and kids love the dog but the mom isn't sure she wants one around the house. To make matters worse, they think he might be too friendly to be a good watch dog.But when a pair of bungling burglars set their sights on the family home... Well, you did see Home Alone, right? Kind of predictable.... but overall a harmless family holiday movie."
1,Poorly Done Family Movie,"This one is hard to watch: Hokey, badly photographed, stupid, predictable story, cheap production. I felt sorry for the adults in it. I did not realize that Dean Cain's career had sunk to this? Got this for my young child who loves dogs and Christmas movies. But, this one was really bad. Not charming at all. My child was pretty bored through the whole thing. Also, I did not like the robber acting like he was going to bludgeon the dog with a golf club. Much better dog movies are the Cats & Dogs series, they're amusing and have reasonably good photography and CGI, unlike this turkey."
3,IT'S CHRISTMAS SO,"Kind of cute movie but not real stimulating to watch, in fact I feel asleep just after getting half way through it. Could of had better writing but it ended up as another ""gotta do another Christmas flick"" no matter how it turns out."
2,I caught him... now what?,"I may have bought this for my baby too late. At 8 months he's already crawling well, but this might be better for a baby who is not quite there and needs encouragement. The monkey makes him laugh and he wants to kiss him, but once it runs off and he catches it, he looks at me like, ""now what?"" The monkey just spins his wheels on his back and my baby crawls off to something else."
2,Needs to move longer,"I bought toy for my daughter when she was almost 8 months old and had just started crawling. She was getting bored with all her old ""stationary"" toys so I figured get her something she can interact with while she moving around on the floor. Big mistake! The monkey doesnt move far AT ALL and then turns around....where's the chase? It also is only activated when the baby touches it and since it's not very sturdy, usually just falls over and then becomes a chew toy for a minute. I would not recommend this toy for any age, crawling or not (unless your baby likes to throw things, it seems to be durable)"
2,Who was this written for?,"As a woman and everyone should know that women make up a large percentage of WWW fans, I can't figure out the intended audience for this book. It had nothing exciting or new in it, my darlin' Arte might as well not have been included, Jim does little more than hang around a railyard buying sodas for a kid...and try to figure out how to get into the villain's hideout. Something the real Jim would have done with no sweat and a lot more panache.This book reads like the author watched maybe one or two first season episodes(By the way, Jim carries his lockpick in his lapel, not his hollow bootheel) and had no idea of its audience or fans.For writers of other novels based on movies or TV shows with fan-followings...DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!"
3,As fun as the TV series,"If you liked the TV series you will enjoy this book. Most of the elements were there: the girls, the gadgets, the delusional villain, the historical references... My only complaint is that I expected more ""fistfight action"" from James West, but I quickly overlooked this as I realized that the book takes place about a decade after the TV series, and maybe James West is not as athletic as he used to be. One can tell that the author did his homework in researching and inventing the plausible gadgets which are characteristic of the TV series. Definitely a fun read."
1,Wrong Robert V!,"People who bought this book solely because they thought the author, Robert Vaughan, is an older actor who was once the star of a campy TV show, will be sorely disappointed to know that Robert Vaughn did NOT write any Wild Wild West paperbacks! Mr. Solo not!"
2,Not for kids,"it was cute, but its not for kids, and the movie quality it not very good. Would not recommend getting it."
3,"Good, but not as good as the classic TMNT games","I was extatic when i found out that a new TMNT game was coming out on gamecube. I couldnt wait to get it. Of course, it was almost inevitable that it wouldnt be as good as the originals were on nintendo and nintendo 64. This was true, but saying that, this is still a fun game. Its the classic beat em up style game...except its very easy. Especially when playing with a friend, it almost gets a little boring because it really isnt possible to lose.I am a competitive gamer, so this was a major downfall for me. It does have great graphics and fairly good gameplay though. In conclusion, i would suggest, even for the die hard fans of previous TMNT games, rent this game first...because its likely you will conquer it in the 3 days of rental.And after the 3 days, if you still love it, pick up a copy."
5,Leggos,Wonderful Christmas gift for my nephew last year. It was the set he picked out. Came on time and was just as described. He immediately put it together. Great product.
4,Works great,Works great as my doctor recommended but I suggest picking this up from Target. The price is alot cheaper and you can print online coupons as well.
2,anticlimax,"I found Robinson's book to be much like Mount Erebus itself: difficult to scale in the beginning, exciting on the summit, cold on the trip down and painful in the end.He should have called in a ""Search And Rescue"" mission to chop the last 180 pages down to a more merciful, less cumbersome 20 or so.I was very glad to finally stumble through- battered, bored, and convinced I'll never again sign up for another of Mr. Robinson's literary trekking expiditions. BPT"
4,A book which should make us think.,"This book demonstrates the power of Science Fiction at its best to look at the here and now. The book developed slowly but this was appropriate giving the reader time to mull over the ideas within while gradually developing the characters (including the Antartic itself). The book is not just about the Antartic but is concerned with the effect of the near present social, economic and political systems and the potential consequences of them. This does not differ from the Mars books however it feels much closer because we are talking about our own planet.This ia a book to make you want to go out and campaign for a better world. The strength of the book is the passion with which these ideas as well as the Antartic is described. I will be recommending this book to friends."
2,slow plot line but good imagary,Very slow in developing much of a story but the descriptions of the terrian and life in the South Pole may make it worthwhile for some.
2,Still waiting for a plot,"Ok, I'm sorry to say I've given up on this book. With so many good books in the world to read...I'm just not willing to waste any more time reading a bad one. After 200 pages...there is still no plot. Maybe I'm missing something and this is supposed to just be lots and lots of talk about a cold white landscape. Oh well"
2,Antarctica: hard reading,"Let me start by saying that I never finished this book. So i am not fully entitled to review it, but, no matter how self-ctitical I can be, I beleive that for someone to put a book down and never pick it up again there must be two guilty parties. So i suppose that the author had something to do with it. This is the second KS Robinson book I tried to read and failed.this, as the mars trilogy before it is a book o great ideas. Great enviromnent, great characters, nut the way they are presented, the style of naration, the whole style of writting seems wrong. very personal oppinion, very biased, but no matter how much I love Robinson's ideas in his books, I cant follow his writting. Maybe with a bit of practice...I just started ""The Martians"" and I am determined to take to the end this time"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"""A group at the Antarctic runs into some mystery and adventure. The main characters are an ex-basketball player and a professional really cold places type guide, both of whom used to have a thing.It seems down here with the whacky male-female relationship women have a bit of fun. The guide expert has to lead a band out of trouble, and an environmental group is at the heart of this novel.You also get some antarctic history.The senator in this book appears in the Forty/Fifty books as well."
3,Weaker than expected. Nothing new after the Mars Trilogy.,"This book isn't one of KSR's stronger works. It's largely derivative from the powerful Mars Trilogy (which everyone should read!) and founders quite a bit, both in character and plot. Much as I hate to admit it, I found myself skipping pages just to get to meatier parts.If you've read the Mars trilogy, you might even consider passing on this book, and reading _The Wild Shore_ instead. If you haven't read the Mars trilogy, what are you waiting for??? Enjoy."
2,snooooooooooooore,"As I slogged though the first 300 pages of this tome, I felt like I had endured the mental equivalent of what Scott and Amundsen went through trying to reach the Pole. After that I died just like Scott (or Amundsen, whichever).Put the book down with no regrets whatsoever. I really loved Red Mars, and found each successive book in that trilogy to be tougher to get through because of all the minutae and wisps of plot threads. Unfortunately Robinson seems to have gotten worse, not better since he finished with Mars."
3,Decent but lacking,"As noted, it's a fine reference, but that assumes that you are up to speed and just need to refresh on a feature. However, if you need to learn InDesign, save yourself lots of cash and buy the user guide from Adobe, they sell it for TWELVE dollars and it is comprehensive and designed for the new learner. Microsoft has trained us all by now not to look at the vendor documentation, but as we know, Adobe is another universe, buy their hard copy guide for a great start with InDesign."
1,ouch,Pale imitation of Cameo-Parkway or even Capitol recordings by the real(?) artist. Recorded by a portable machine (?) with lots of wow and flutter--you can hear the phasiness from the start once every reel turn--and a keyboard such as department stores used to sell to preteens. Dig that cymbal key at 900% screechiness! Shall not even mention tempos or lack thereof.
4,Nostalgia at its finest,"Hey guys and gals born in the mid/late 80s and children of today enjoying the new series, the turtles are back and are kicking butt again! This game is what I've been waiting for for a long time. It's fun, but I think us older kids playing this will miss the old theme music and other stuff, but yeah the turtles are still here and the giant mouse who was their master, April, etc. The graphic style of the game is cool and cartoony which is cool in my eyes and there are cool cut scenes. It's cool game overall, but by all means not the best game ever. You'll enjoy this if you played other TMNT games, like other reviewers have said."
4,yeah it's good.,"here's the deal, there's only like 7 or 8 actual songs on here, probably 2 of which really aren't that good. so technically, you're paying for just a couple of good ones. however, those songs are not only really good, everything else is ridiculously funny. F.O.O.D. almost made me get in a car accident, mood 4 luv made me trickle in my pants, and you get the idea. it's good and funny, thus you should get it."
4,"Catchy, filled with great hooks","This album is very funny, but at the same time it's catchy. I laugh everytime I hear Linkin Verbs. Happy V-Day will be stuck in your head forever. Dewees still knows how to right a great hook. My favorites songs on this album are Happy V-Day, Megan 2k2, and Congratulations Smack + Katy."
3,Hmmmm....,Not nearly as good as the first two. Kind of bland...but still better than most of the horibble music out there.
4,A book I would recommend to others!,"I enjoyed Negrita Jayde's upbeat and positive approach to the reader. She goes indepth to explain the ""curves"" of the female body and how to acheive them in a sensible manner. Her methods are goal oriented and not intimidating. She is quite candid with the reader and explains at the start that in order to attain the symetric body the reader is after, the reader will have to work at it. She is quite convincing and reassuring that anyone can achieve the symetry. The only part of the book I found to be poor is the diet section...I think it is far too restrictive and therefore, takes away from the book..."
3,It's Not Make,"Basically, if you're a fan of Make: Technology on Your Own Time for the interesting PEOPLE who make stuff, you'll enjoy this book. If you're mainly interested in the ideas and the projects, then skip it."
4,Craftsman???,"These leads are the exact same leads that came with my Craftsman Professional DVOM (Digital Volt, Ohm, Meter). I have been using them for 4 years straight before they finally kicked the bucket. One of the leads has an open in it somewhere and gives me erroneous readings. My only gripe with the leads is the flange/lip on the end of the leads. This prevents you from being able to stick the leads into certain areas. The lip forces the lead away from where you are trying to obtain the reading. This is why the 4-star rating. Other than that they are great leads."
5,"Well done, Nancy Rechtman!","I so enjoyed reading My Little One. Nancy Rechtman brings her characters to life and I found myself reaching the last page with a groan because I wanted more! Following the frenetic life of Emma Bronfman as she defines her inability to conceive as a failure to her womanhood and self-esteem is funny, sad, sometimes pathetic and always poignant.Nancy's short and easy to read style has you identifying with Emma as we peek inside the windows of her life. Don't be too surprised if you find yourself chanting, 'baby, baby, baby, please.'Lynn Price - Author of 'A Separate Beginning'"
4,Nice Toddler Suit,I ordered this for my daughter to use for a Halloween costume (Our family went as A President with Secret Service Agents). I needed an inexpensive black toddler suit. I had a hard time finding a toddler black suit that was inexpensive. No stores carried a complete suit with jacket that was less than $75. This was perfect. It arrived quickly and was neatly packaged. The tie was one of those zipper ties so it was easy to take on and off and to adjust. It fit my daughter perfectly and I plan on handing it down to nephews and cousins to use for special occasions. Well worth the price.
4,Great synthetic motor oil.... a little shy of 5 gallons.,"I bought this 5 gallon pail thinking I would get two oil changes for my diesel truck which needs 10 quarts per change. I carefully measured the quarts for the first oil change, using only 10 quarts. That should have left 10 quarts for the second change. When I did the next change, I came up 3/4 of a quart short. I called the company and was told they fill the pails by weight, not by volume or liquid measurement. I informed them that I had purchased 5 gallons, regardless of how they fill the pails and that i was now short for a complete oil change. The customer service person apologized and immediately sent me a couple quarts, free of charge. I was advised that they would be looking into the filling process to ensure that 5 gallons was in fact 5 gallons.It is a great synthetic oil and I am very happy with it. It deserves 5 stars and I would have given them except for the short change...."
4,great gift!,"I received two of these as a gift and I am very happy with them. I installed them on the wall in my workshop and got to work squirreling away lots of electrical parts, screws, bolts, nuts and assorted bits of hardware. I did not use the drawer dividers, they seem kind of useless. I'd also like them better if there were an easier way to label some of the drawers."
1,Really disappointed,"I am really disappointed that I received a product that was not fully functional and had broken parts, or it was a possible design flaw. About 4 or 5 drawers had parts were broken so the drawer doesn't open or close properly. Also it took a very long time to receive this product, about 2 weeks. If the drawers weren't broken and the product shipped faster, I would be rating 5 stars. I don't feel that it is fair that I pay for a new product and the one I received does not work as designed."
3,Is something missing?,"Overall I'm happy with the drawers. The divider tabs are on the back part of the plastic molding and you have to cut them off if you need them. However, there are 44 drawers in all. There are only 4 Large and 8 small dividers on the back. Where are the others? What if someone wants to divide ALL of their drawers? Let me guess...there's a separate purchase to be made."
4,Pretty nice,"I bought this to store electrical components for projects I am working on. The plastic feels kind of cheap but at the same time its not horrible... just could have been a little better. The drawers are made of very flexible plastic and I kind of wish they were a little stronger. I am very puzzled at why the larger drawers have plastic notches to insert a divider to split the larger compartment into 2 pieces, but it does not come with any of the dividers?!?!? It is actually kind of frustrating and would have been nice to have those dividers.Overall it hold parts... can be mounted on the wall... it does what it is suppose to and I am happy.On a side note... I am a little disappointed with the price I paid. ($34.90) Although re branded by other local retailers, I was able to find this exact product for $8 cheaper..."
5,Great storage for Lego blocks,"I was looking for something to store my boy's Lego blocks and came across this cabinet.It is great thing has a lot of drawers, good quality plastic.I am very happy with this purchase I even got the same cabinet for my nephew for his blocks.Very sturdy, good quality and great price. You will not be sorry :))"
3,"This is made of cheap, bendy plastic, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do.","You need a bunch of drawers to hold small electronic parts or otherwise. It does the job. Don't expect it to withstand any sort of beating or movement.The drawers do not lock in in any reasonable way and the dividers which are modeled into the back (you break them out to use them), once removed, will weaken the back structure slightly."
5,Perfect for Crafting Supplies!,"I ordered the Akro-Mils 10164 and 10144 to use for storage for my jewelry making accessories (i.e. beads, charms, findings, etc.). It's PERFECT! The drawers are pretty small, so perfect for beads. The 10144 model that had 12 of the larger drawers are great for storing ribbon and such, as well. I used a couple of the drawer dividers that come included (attached to the back of the unit, which you just cut/snap off). There aren't enough of them included to be used in all of the drawers, but I think cardboard or posterboard would probably work just as well. The only negative I have is that the two plastic bars that go across the back were slightly bent in, which makes the middle drawers all pop out slightly rather than closing all the way. But, they are still secure enough to not fall out, so I'm not worried about it. Overall, this is great for my jewelry making needs!"
2,"Nice configuration, so-so execution","The idea of this product is excellent. It gives you a lot of drawers for organizing all those little items lying around in drawers. I would like the drawers themselves to be longer, as it doesn't really accommodate tubes of things, such as sunscreen, hair gel, etc.My biggest problem with this product is that the shelves do not sit very snugly in the frame. They slide out if the case is tipped even a little bit forward. When pulling them open, they come out completely too easily. The case itself is very lightweight. The overall feeling of the product is flimsy, with drawers half open or falling out and the case in danger of falling over.This is a good, inexpensive option if you have a lot of little items to keep sorted and some way to secure the case and drawers."
5,Akro Mils 44 Drawer Cabinet,"Hi all,This product is made great, and you will be happy with Akro Mils.Enjoy,Thomas"
2,impatient,"I placed my order and waited nearly 2 weeks before they even acknowledged my order and processed it. once they had it was here in a week, and I like the product. I may have not ordered knowing their long processing time."
3,"Yes, we are done...",A pretty good attempt at being a family! It is funny and then not so funny! It is strictly for entertainment and laughs. There is no depth to this movie. Can be viewed by the family.
3,3.5 Its not THAT bad People,"Are We Done Yet is not as bad as everyone on here would have you believe. Its not as funny as Are We There Yet, but it does hold its own. One thing I did wish they'd touched on is what happened to the kids dad. At the end of the first movie he was with his new wife and baby. Did he just completely forget about them. Anywho my kids loved it and have watched it over and over. Its one of the few movies you can allow your kids to watch without worry of foul language, sex, or violence. It's a good wholesome family movie."
3,"Good at many things, but not the best at any one thing","This was a good book, and I've read several of Dawkins books. But I didn't find it the best at covering any one particular subject. In fact, I think Dawkins skims many scientific areas which most laypeople with some interest in science are already familiar with. In other words, you already know some of this stuff. Carl Sagan writes a more definitive defense of science (Science as a Candle in the Dark), and Matt Ridley (Genome: History of Species in 23 Chapters) along with Enrico Coen (The Art of Genes) do a better job of explaining genetics in laymans terms. I found The Art of Genes especially helpful in explaining how the a gene's influence unfolds. If you've got no experience with pop science books, try something like Carl Sagan's Cosmos first. Don't get me wrong, this book was good, just not the best. Yes, it's somewhat poetic, by I found that Ridley and Coen write better prose."
5,Science or Magic?,"Richard Dawkins has the rare gift of turning science talk into poetry. While boasting a wide range of scientific knowledge, he inspires the reader into wonderment at how discoverable the universe just is. Anyone who is curious about all the mysteries of the universe -anyone with a mind capable of wondering- don't be satisfied with magical, less than logical explanations, he warns. Keep wondering. You might be surprised at how discoverable most things are with a little bit of scientific scrutiny."
5,Second Touch will touch you!,"This series is wonderful! ""Second Touch"" is quite possibly my favorite book from this series to date. The historical facts about lepers and their colonies combined with the heart wrenching story of one is the definition of truly brilliant historical fiction. Give this series a try. You won't be disappointed! Even if you have never read the Thoene's works before this would be a great series to start with."
1,i wish i could review this product,"i ordered it along with my klean kanteen bottles, but it was never shipped.no explanation, no apology. just a refund.why didn't they ship them to me in a second shipment if they didn't include them in the first orginal shipment?"
4,"Nice bottles, but a little expensive","We use these a lot, and are very happy with them. Only bad thing is the price. I'll bet the price will be coming down soon. Other people are offering similar bottles a lot cheaper. The shoulder sling is descent."
3,Paying lip service....,"The bottles seem to be sturdy but they will not keep a liquid hot or cold as would a thermos. I know that they are not constructed for that purpose but...it's the lip of the bottle that is bad. I always end up with a bit of chin dribble that is due entirely to poor design. These need to go back to the design team and they should actually use them for a week or so.....Lynn, ..in Nashville...btw, the sling should have some adjustability...."
1,"poor company, terrible CS","can't review product, however the company is poor! More than a month since payment and have yet to receive the bottles, I did get a seperate shipment for the harness, customer service has yet to respond. BEWARE"
1,Nothing but problems,"Bought this printer on recommendation from other purchasers on Amazon. When it finally arrived, it never worked. Brother support was worthless! They kept offering to send me base units to solve my problem. After two exchanges, I assumed that the problem must have been with the drum unit. Brother kept on assuming it was the base unit. I gave up and sent it back.A terrible shame since I have used Brother monochrome laser printers and MFCs for several years without a problem. Lesson to us all: When buying a color laser printer there are no cheap alternatives."
1,"Japan, magnet for brainless, aspiring travel writers...","This book is shockingly poor. The Japan I have lived in for 5 years (as an English teacher) bears no resemblance to the Japan depicted by this trite slab of pulp unworthy of its own binding. Sadly, I realise that this 'gaijin' fool - this blacksmith of gross cultural simplifications, this purveyor of only the best-known cliches - is not alone. Her inadequate, self-flattering account recalls anecdotes I hear from other English teachers. Faced with such defiant, cultural adversity, their love of cultural difference morphs into a reinforced belief in the superiority of their own culture. They love and yet they hate, so why do they stay? My advice to Josie Dew: on yer' bike, it's time to go home and stay home."
3,Really Average,"Covers only the first part of the exam. My question would be, what happens next?If you really want my answer, here is it. Save your money and get either O'Reilly & Associates ""LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell"" by Jeffrey Dean or Hungry Minds, Inc's ""LPIC 1 Certification Bible"" by Jason Nash and Angie Nash.Both offer Part I and Part II exams, and what's more, the former is less than the Prep Kit--two for the price of one! [The] LPIC Bible [might cost a little] more, but if you consider that the material is superior and it includes the second exam, it is still much cheaper."
2,General Linux 1 Prep Kit,"Although some care and thought has been made to laying out the book and its' pamphlet and cdrom, it contains more errors than any technical book that I have seen. The cdrom tests are particularly bad on errors. I cannot believe this book made it to press at all. If you use it, be warned, and don't use it as your only source. Even with the poor editing and proofreading, I benefitted from it as another source of test information."
3,Mixed review,"First time I used this radio, I could only get one station, the next night I was out walking, I was able to pickup about 5 stations... for such a small unit, I am amazed how well it scans and how clear the stations do come in once it finds some. I am not in a big city...so not sure why some days are better than others. I wish the earplugs were replaceable.. the unit is all one piece. I do not like the ear buds... my husband says they are fine, but I would prefer something that would stay in my ears...to big for my ears...For the price, it was a good deal... looking for soft cover for the ear buds that sit in the inner ear.."
3,they're back,"This band has been around forever and this is only their third full length. Despite the fact that this band will probably get shafted on the promotional aspect of this album and the production is anything but stellar, this still stands taller than a fairshare of hardcore records out there. It's far from the most unique thing you're going to hear, but if you're just looking for an album thats a real hardcore record this is for you. The guitar solos are fantastic, the riffing is fast, and the vocals (as always) sound legitimately pissed off."
1,Received Broken Machine and No Accessories,"The machine I received was broken. In addition, it was missing all the accessories. I am extremely disappointed in Amazon.com because I sent a message requesting the accessories (before wediscovered the machine was broken) and they sent a reply telling me to contact the manufacturer for the accessories. Be aware that if something is missing from your shipment, they will expect YOU to contact the manufacturer!"
5,Remarkable,"I bought this book in hardcover back in 1987 at the age of 13 because it was on the bargain rack for $5. I read it that night and discovered there was a sequel. I begged my mother into a ride in to the mall and then begged the $20 (oh, when hardbacks this big were $20!) out of her and read A Man Rides Through in two days. I have read it 12 times since. It is the most remarkable duology I have ever read. It is not only a tightly crafted tale with completely fleshed and magnficent characters, but a combination of so many genres: fantasy, sci-fi, action, thriller, mystery, horror, romance. And all in only about 1300 pages! I must admit, I can't decide who is my favorite, Adept Havelock, King Joyse, Geraden or Terisa. I feel like I know them. And I'm proud that I do. If you want to find the true meanings of courage, integrity, loyalty and love, these books are all you'll need."
1,couldn't finish it,"One of the few books that I couldn't will myself to finish. I waited and waited for something interesting to happen, but it became apparent the author was just setting up for a sequel. At that point I just started skipping long useless passages and concentrated on the dialogue. But the characters are so flat that their conversations were simple back-and-forth affairs that barely register. And finally, the ludicrous attempted seduction of the female protagonist by the bad guy (how stupid is she??) is such a blatant attempt to titillate the young male adolescent audience that it's insulting. Pure hackwork."
4,"Good, But Thomas Covenant Is Better","The novel starts out slowly, and only my love of the Thomas Covenant series kept me going. By the middle of the novel, I became interested. The storyline, characters, and plots became increasingly complex and impossible to predict. And while the novel so far isn't as dark as the Thomas Covenant series, it is still a good read. I recommend it."
5,an entrancing fantasy masterwork,"This book is one of those ""hard-to-put-down"" classics that will leave you hungry for the conclusion. If you read it, you will have no choice but to read the sequel. Stephen Donaldson has a marvelous talent for character personification. Terisa, Geraden, Myste, Elega: all of them make you grieve for hurts against them, experience euphoria at their triumphs, and suffer indignation at injustices committed to them. On the other hand, don't read this book if you are not planning to be totally absorbed by the convoluted story line and elusive climax(es). The realism of this book, in spite of Imagery, an unheard of practice in our world, is so compelling that it will drive you to return to this book again and again"
3,Fun stuff,"It has been cool to see the movie for the first time uncut even if it`s the R-rated american film, because the version available in Austria was cut by some minutes thank`s to the f#&$ing german censors."
4,"""I Eat Green Berets For Breakfast!""","Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rae Dawn Chong and Alyssa Milanostar in this 1985 action film. An ex-special forces colonelrescues his kidnapped daughter from a South Americandictator. This is a good 80's action flick and Arnoldis great as usual. This dvd not only has nice pictureand sound, but theatrical & director's cuts plus neatextras. I recommend this."
3,Good flick,"I love the 80's! This being one of his earlier films it was pretty cheesy, but most movies were back then!"
3,Hare-brained actioner,"One of the best action films of the eighties, ""Commando"" would seem simply infantile if it were made today. It would not even qualify as a ""direct-to-video"" release. The dialogue is abysmal and provides some unintentional amusement. The performances are sub-average, as one would expect from this type of film. The plot is nonsense. The campy villains are strictly comic-book cut-outs. The final scene (Arnie's infiltration of the Latin American island fortress and his blowing away every scumbag that gets in his way) still thrills, however, and, if one may say so, rises from the ridiculous to the sublime."
2,"It's a classic, but not worth you time","I am re-watching old movies and I figured I'd give this one a try. Bad acting, fairly predictable plot.Save you time and watch something uplifting."
3,The guiltiest of pleasures,"I should feel deeply ashamed to be such a fan of this movie, but I'm not. In terms of artistic merits, it's a complete disaster; in terms of providing satisfaction to the viewer's inner idiot, it's a masterpiece. They don't come much dumber than ""Commando"": Ahnuld spends 90 minutes popping dopey one-liners and doing his best to combat overpopulation (by pummeling everyone who crosses his path). If you feel the desperate need to shut down your brain for a while, ""Commando"" accomplishes the task effortlessly. Its closest competitor is Chuck Norris's ""Invasion USA,"" but Chuck sometimes looks like he's actually thinking, which tragically spoils the illusion."
1,PodMaxx A Giant Disappointment,"So far I have purchased 2 of these poor excuses for finished software. Neither ever installed properly on my PC running XP home edition. The error I kept receiving was "" computer not modified"". On my first copy, despite entering the proper license ID and Password, it would always give me an error code that said that I had not entered the correct license ID.Save yourself the trouble and frustration. This company should send all of its customers who purchased the previous terrible versions either full rebates or the latest version, assuming that PoddMax 09 actually works which I doubt. I really wanted all the features to work but alas, none ever did on my desktop or laptop. Support for any of these problems was totally non existent. It is as close to a sham as I have ever seen. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for carrying this piece of trash.Podmaxx 09"
1,Don't make the mistake I did,"The box says Podmaxx 09, and compatible with IPhone. Well, the software is apparently the same as 08. The program will not recognize my IPhone even though it shows up on my computer as a portable storage device.The worst part though... ZERO support. The only option is filling out a form on their website which is another waste of time because they won't respond. I have requested assistance twice and not as much as an email in return.I can't say if this would work on iPod, and I won't try it on mine because I need it for my iPhone.Don't waste your money if you are buying it for an iPhone. Try the evaluation copy and you can see it does not work, and they shouldn't be advertising that it does."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Horrible Customer Service!,"If I could give this product NO stars I WOULD! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not offer a phone number for Tech Support and when you email them, they NEVER reply! I used there product for a few months and even gave them a positive review on it, but then it STOPPED WORKING!!!!!!!!! I had the 2007 Podmaxx BUT WARNING......... The 2008 Podmaxx IS WORSE!!!! It will NOT record ANY DVDS in your Collection EXCEPT for home DVDs!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"
2,Lack of plot coupled with bad translation?,"I've never really been a fan of The Bible, and The Student NIV is no exception. I really can't fathom what makes it such a great literary work when it has a lacking plot, indecipherable narratives, bad POV changes, and a terribly disconnected ending. I mean, New Jerusalem? Who would buy that? And doesn't one find the idea of streets paved with gold to be outdated? Another thing, the switch from the Jews to the Christians is a bit murky. I can't see one guy (albeit a cool dude like J) coming to save the world from an end that the world can save itself from.Isn't the Bible just a bad mythological misconception of historical occurances around Macedonia in 4000 B.C.? I'm amazed that such a large cult following has developed from the very idea! Perhaps one shouldn't be so sloppy in choosing a cult (remember Jonestown,) but Christianity could really use a better book.I, for one, wasn't impressed."
3,pretty good,"great price for an all wooden and well made toy, especially featuring kid's favorite characters, but the pieces are a big bit and clunky, I think it would manuever more easily if the pieces had been smaller or there had been more room to move them between the wires. overall good though."
1,complicated and lack focus,"I was looking for a book to give me guidelines to an asia pacific work, but couldnt fing it in this book since is so badly written."
5,Outstanding reference,"This book has received many kudos from prominent academics and businesspeople -- and I would like to add my own here. An extraordinary labor undertaken by Professor Usha harnessing the talent and output of some of the most prominent researchers working on the Asia Pacific. Their insights and arguments on business processes ranging from initial entry into countries, to managing human resource problems, to circumventing political and financial risks, make this book invaluable. Though not necessarily bed-time reading, and some of the analysis is not intended for the layman, parts of this book (if not all as it does cover an enormous area) should be read by anyone doing business in the vast and complex Asia-Pacific region, or by researchers exploring business-related topics. An essential reference."
1,Worthless,"I bought this book when it first came out, chiefly because it was published by my favorite publisher, Oxford U.P. I was stunned by how worthless the book is. I could have written it 50 years ago as a high school sophomore. But even then I wouldn't have been silly enough as to interrupt an account of the political troubles of the late Republic with the explanation that Brute in ""Et tu, Brute?"" is in the vocative case. Is this history? Shakespearean criticism? Linguistics?The chief lesson I learned from this book is to beware of Oxford U.P. I have bought hundreds, maybe thousands, of books published by OUP. I have been saddened to see Oxford lower its standards on paper and binding. The Oxford Latin Dictionary is one of the few books I've bought lately from OUP that is actually stitched. And now this book (along with Following Hadrian, another mistake) raises the question of substantive standards at OUP. Caveat emptor."
2,High Maintenance Product,I purchased a number of these machines to resell and have had problems with 2 out of 5. One truly had a mechanical problem and the other did not come with a manual! This is very inconvienent for reselling since I am responsible for a product that is said to be OK except for cosmetic problems. There were more problems than that!
2,singer 5050 sewing machines,"when i first saw this machine i thought it to be the best in its price range. it offered lots of features like the four step button hole , 52 stitich functions etc. the day i brought home my first new machine , the bobbin case was loose and so the machine wasn't working. i returned it and exchanged it for another one and this time the stitch selector function wasn't working..i was really dissappointed with both the experiences.i do not recommend buying this machine without first checking if all the functions are working..i think it would be best to buy refurbished ones as they are repaired and factory tested and seem to be doing well. i bought my machine from walmart and they exchanged it without any fuss and i was glad i bought it there."
4,"Durable, breathable and less strech marks","My daughter has very sensetive skin.I've tried several different diapers for her. Tendercare diapers seem to be the best one for her. The diapers are duralbe and breathable.Most of all, Tendercare diapers leave less strech marks on her skin than other diapers, such as seventh generation."
2,So tiny,These are very tiny compared to the picture. I just expected them to be larger than they are. I was actually kinda disappointed when I received them and saw they were about the size of the palm of my hand.
2,A Shirley Temple Movie?,"This is the worst Shirley Temple movie I have ever seen. It is not a Shirley Temple movie at all. She is only featured in it at the most, 4 times. The whole movie was silly, but not in a good way. A guy that jumps into a fish tank, a talking penquin, political figures acting like children or gymnast.. The movie was not realistic at all.. Hardly a story line. Just when the plot started to get good (minus the dumb parts), the movie ended! If you get this movie just because you are a Shirley Fan, it is NOT worth it!"
2,Shirley's Hardly Seen,"I bought this movie with the expectation it would be one of Shirley's better films since it was done when she was just a little tot. I was disappointed Shirley is hardly shown in this movie at all.This movie was one of Shirley's first feature length films-- and it focuses more on the adults than, Shirley's cute dancing and precious nature- despite the fact it has one of Shirley's most well-known scenes ""Baby Take A Bow"" in that classic baby-doll poka dot dress. And once again you see Shirley's on screen dad Dunn(Baby Take A Bow).Since Shirley is rarely seen one can hardly call it a ""Shirley"" movie- not to mention the storyline is cheesy and over-dramatized. I found myself falling asleep instead of being amused.With no Shirley and no real show stopping music. It is a real disappoint even to the biggest Temple fan. Go and buy a real Shirley Temple movie instead."
2,Whiner's Revenge,"Largely a collection of personal anecdotes culled from numerous cruises which disappointed the author. After awhile, you get the sense that he is a ""professional griper"" angling for freebies from the cruise line. Much of his complaining is petty. However, by disregarding the whines and pouts, you can still glean interesting details about the cruise industry which, of course, the industry prefers to keep under its collective hat. Not the best book out there for cruise info."
5,swan princess 1& 3,"had it on 2 seperate vhs's so knew the product, pakage nice, arrive in tack only thing i coud wish for is all 3 of the set in 1 package.,"
3,Arrived as advertised,"Arrived as advertised, shipping was fast. Game uses a bit older technology but is a good value.Not sure why but putting and chip shots are not as realistic as full shots, this is likely the software not the hardware."
5,Great headphones for the price!,"I had a similar pair of headphones but they were extremely old and all scratched up. But even after years of use, they still worked like brand new. Anyways I decided to buy new ones and use my old ones for backup. These were the cheapest ones I could find so I decided to buy them and guess what? THEY'RE AWESOME! I love these headphones compared to other low cost headphones. If you want nice quality sound, I would definitely recommend these."
2,earbuds,earbud covering tore the first time I tried to put it on; won't stay in ear; not using them due to the above problems.
4,Great while they worked,"They are comfortable and sound considerably better than the earbuds that came with my player. The cord is a nice length, too, and I like the L-shaped plug. I'm sure there are much better earphones out there, but for under $10, I think these are a great buy.UPDATE: After a year and a half, the left side no longer works. Not sure if the cause is in the earbud itself or the plug, but either way, I can no longer use them. I did use them a lot and take them around everywhere, and apparently it is not uncommon for earphones to fail after this much time. All in all, I would probably purchase them again."
2,too large ear buds,Unless you have large ear openings do not buy this product. It does not fit and if on the ear it falls off while running. Small in ear bud is best option
3,Good for the price but lasted only 4 months,"I've had these for around 4 months and have subjected them to simple gym use. They finally stopped working on me today and I am not sure if sweat has finally taken its toll on these but they are no longer operational. For the price I am not dissatisfied but I would liked to have owned them for at least 6-8 months. I will still buy another pair seeing as how these are just for gym usage. Quality is good, I am no audiophile by any means but they don't blow me away. They're about a midway point between cheap headphones and Beats by Dre headphones."
5,Good Headphones,"These are great headphones. I get good sound and my roommate can't hear any residual noise from my music. The only tiny problem is my ears sometimes ache after using them for six hours or longer (usually during a cramming session) because they're a little too big for my ears. Other than that, these are amazing headphones."
1,Do not buy,"These sound great for a short time , but quicky broke within a week. My son went through 5 pairs in a month. You do the math."
2,Didn't Last,These were OK but didn't last very long. One of the buds went out soon after the first use. I would look for something a little more expensive with the hope that you are getting what you pay for.
2,Find better at a dollar store.,I gave 2 stars because the book is short. I had to actually scan over this just to finish it. Not worth your time or money. It's overpriced and underwritten.
4,$29.99 for a very pretty green,The cross hatch pattern is more yellow than it appears in the picture.
1,good material for one episode...,"...of a daytime soap opera.I have to confess I read the book in a fraction of the time I read ""Sister of my heart"". Almost nothing new has been added to the story. Yet it fills up so many pages. Feelings, ramblings, letters from one character to another. That's the kind of stuff I don't really care about. It adds nothing and makes it difficult to read. This is a pathetic sequel to ""Sister of my heart""."
3,I hope there's a 3rd in the series...,"I really enjoy CBD's books but I have not yet made up my mind about Vine of Desire. Sister Of My Heart left me with a sense of excitement and hope for Sudha's unknown future in America. But after finishing Vine Of Desire I was left only with a feeling of sadness, and that something was irreplaceably broken. The fact that it bothers me so much is probably a testament to Divakaruni's writing.I found myself rooting for Sunil & Sudha to unite later on, partly because of Dayita. Regardless, I did not feel that the story wrapped up as tidily as it should have.I hope Divakaruni writes another in this series just so this isn't the note that I leave Anju, Sudha, and Sunil on."
2,Victorian melodrama in a sari,"In the typical Victorian potboiler, the bad temptress repents, rejects her sexuality and ends up either dead, or humbled and living in a convent. Fast forward to the United States in the present-day and you have The Vine of Desire. This novel features stock characters (with an Indian patina) and a cliched plot. The writing alternately gushes and stammers. The female characters have three dimensional moments but the male characters are one-dimensional cardboard."
1,Not even worth borrowing from the library,"Poorly edited without the strong sense of emotion that normally pervades Chitra Divakaruni's writing. This book was extremely disappointing, and I couldn't even finish it.Sister of My Heart and Arranged Marraiges were absolutely stunning works. Please don't read this one."
2,Not as good as I expected....,This book was difficult to get through and I felt very disappointed after reading it. Divakaruni's style of writing is good. She is quite descriptive but if felt she did a poor job with the story. I didn't care for any of the characters and still had too many questions after finishing the book. I also felt some parts of the book were drawn out too long.
2,The Fat Burning Baloney,"This book offers nothing new on the weight loss or fat burning front. Simply pages and pages of regergitating whats already ""out there"". The book constist of 80% therories and 20% techniques. I was particularly frustrated with the section title 9 Foods That Burn Fat. I read and reread this section and it DOES NOT list ANY foods, let alone 9. The whole chapter consist of calorie counting and ""suggested meal plans"", no specfics as title indicates. My whole point was to learn WHICH foods I need to make sure to incorporate into my own meal plan.The only benefit I got from this book was the excercise plans which included great photos/instructions. Buying an excercise video would be more beneficial. Overall if you are a health novice and have no idea that body fat is bad, starving your self doesnt work,etc. then this is a good buy."
5,Leaves No Heart Excuses,"Edward Welch has a knack for writing in a way that gently but accurately handles the heart for life-long behavioral modification born out of a heart submitted in trust to Christ Jesus. His style in some ways reminds me here and there of Paul David Tripp and many of the helpful books he has written. It's hard not to recommend anything these two gentlemen write. If you have come to the end of your rope and are tired, I would give this book a sincere look."
5,"Debunking Alcohol Addiction as ""Disease""","I find Welch's approach to the ""disease"" model of alcoholism as honest and refreshing. Those caught up in the cult of recovery, cling to this last vestige of something outside of self as the key problem. One is not ""in recovery""; one is either healed or not healed; one is either consuming or not consuming. I find living a life ""in recovery"" akin to marrying the true love of your life but with an iron clad prenup agreement. In both cases we are preparing ourselves to fail. Welch's debunking of alcohol addiction as ""disease"" rattles the cage of consensus quite nicely."
3,Disappointed,"Having read the book less than a week before seeing the movie, I was extremely disappointed in this movie. To me, if felt like there wasn't enough of the book written into the movie. Too much of the actual storyline was cut and changed in order to fit into a certain amount of time.Nate is the ATTORNEY not the Sheriff. Charlie is BEN'S dog, not Adam's. There were so many changes from book to movie that if it weren't for the sisters' names and the title of the movie, I wouldn't think it was supposed to be ""Montana Sky""."
2,Not impressed,"I was under the impression that Chilton was a reputable publisher of good quality manuals. I was disappointed to find pictures of the pre-SN95 engine. There are many differences between the fox-body and the SN95 Mustangs. Additionally, a couple of pages had pieces torn out of the middle of the pages, making the diagrams and information on those pages unusable. The tears must have been from the printers since I received the manual in shrink-wrap. If I ever have to buy another shop manual, it will definitely not be from Chilton. I'll give Haynes a try."
3,"Good, could be better",This is a fine repair manual... just don't trust the pictures. Almost all of the pictures are from an older model Mustang and don't match the 94-98 mustangs.Get the Haynes and use this as a supplement.
2,Disciple Making??,"I believe that this book could be used with individuals who are just getting involved in disciplemaking, which may include us all. I was disappointed in that the real issues of disciple making were relegated to one chapter and in light of the books title, I feel it misses the mark."
1,Not what was expected,"I expected a professionally made video of makeup techniques for different types of Asian faces. The video came as a ""copy"", no cover box or anything. There was only one model and basically one type of style of makeup. The instructor was uneasy before the camera and the lighting was horrendous. Not worth the money, I'm hurriedly returning it."
4,Good Magazine,"This is one of the better fitness magazines. I'd like to see more articles covering nutrition, but overall always a good read. If you like this try Maximum Fitness Magazine."
2,Overly Packed With Advertising,"I subscribed to this magazine for a year and started out satisfied with the issues. There was always one good article on lifting techniques, with a smattering of some good health trivia; otherwise, the magazine was jammed with ads for supplements."
1,$ 400 support package ???,"Apple is constantly trying to drum into us the mantra that Apple is better out of the box than Microsoft and other products. I got an Apple MacBook as a gift. It cost about $ 1200. So the idea now is, just to keep it running, I need to go to my local Apple store and buy a ""protection"" package for $ 400 (which is about 30 % of the product !!). Can you imagine if we had to do that when we buy a car ? And Apple is trying to convince us that it is cutting edge, user-friendly, and much better than Microsoft. I don't buy it. Apple is good at design and marketing. The hardware and software is iffy at best. I left my Macbook today with about 60 % battery. I returned and it had 0 % battery left. Where did that power go ??? The battery issue continues to plague Apple. I will never, ever buy an Apple product. I continue to get them as gifts. I got the MacBook. I don't want to buy the bogus $ 400 ""protection package"".It is time to say it: the Emperor has no clothes."
2,Just Not Very Helpful,"It is true that Sammy was one of the strongest chess players of the western hemisphere for many, many years, but it is not true that this book has a very helpful format.The book relies too much on sparsely annotated games. I simply don't recommend it, as it essentially just gives a list of pithy chunks of advice followed by games that illustrate the advice. The problem is that even moderately strong players understand many concepts without realizing when to apply them (or when they are to be overruled) in standard play. This text gives little insight into these issues."
1,Will we ever learn,"This Video harkens us to heed blind phobia. The distasteful belief that what is not mine is evil. I don't begrudge them their attitude, but the conclusions reached are silly at best."
3,Witchcraft reignited,"I want to thank the producers of this film for giving me another chance at exploring the glories and intricacies of withcraft. I had missed out on it while young due to misguided preachers that led me astray. My preconceptions that Potter was just for kids might have caused me to miss out on the subtle use of the devil's work - had it not been for the pioneering work of these producers.Through the keen vision of this uniquely comparative study, I am now equipped to glean the richest, most diabolical wisdom possible by the most entertaining of youthfully spirited books - Harry Potter.The only problem I have with this remarkable video is the nagging suspicion that it is a sneaky marketing ploy on the part of Rowlings' publisher to stir up additional interest in its content.It's all a very interesting, sinuous exploration of converging ideas and dark conspiracies."
5,A rollicking good story of railroad life,"John Orr tells an extraordinary tale of his father's life as a steam locomotive engineer. There's no glamour or romance, just a very candid description of a hard, dirty, and dangerous job. The book details the complexities of maintaining and operating a steam locomotive and the train behind it and of O.P. Orr's exceptional skill at it and dedication to it.There's considerable depth in describing the intricacies of operating a major railroad and of Orr's relationship with management.My wife gave me this book as a Christmas gift, and I enjoyed it so much that I gave another copy to my brother for his birthday."
4,High Sierra,"This is about as big as your gonna get away with on the plane, so you maximize your pack rat benefit with this bag. The bag is just great and will be easy for me to use on my travells. I give my bag 4 stars, But I hope it can take the bumps and throwing around when the airport workers throw the bags on the plane, that is one of the reasons why I sent for a durable bag. Most air-lines donot take reponsiblity for the damage that most bags receive. My zippers are holding up great and the seams by the zippers; just as good."
4,So far so good,"Just returned from a 12 day trip to Panama with this pack. I've used travel packs before but I needed a wheeled one this time (I'm 66 years old and can't always handle the on-off-on nature of these in airports, etc.). So I loaded it up with 35 lbs of stuff and hit the road. Unlike some others, I found the wheels held up OK even over gravel sidewalks and muddy roadsides. I'm not saying they couldn't break of course, just that they worked for me on this trip. And what a joy to be able to roll through airports! Oh yeah, the wheels took a beating on the escalators too. :)That said, the straps really aren't that comfortable or well balanced. I wonder if more expensive packs combine all the elements better?"
2,Disappointed,I purchased this bag last year and have been extrememly disaapointed with it not lasting long. On my second trip the plastic strap holder on the back broke. I have had High Sierra already send replacements for the zipper tabs and the locking front plastic straps. The velcro strap holder for the carrying straps is already coming apart as well. The zipper is now breaking. I have had the bag since November of 2011. Not a good bag for extensive travel.The best feature is the dual compartments which is great as I can keep soiled garments in one side and clean in the other.
5,High Sierra,"I think there is no better product on the market right now and for the price you'll pay.High Sierra got all you'll need: great name,great design,exellent space,many diff.""drawers"",durability,flexibility(back-pack,carry-on,pull-behind).PS...got the 32"" used few times for US-EU travel...got some scratches,probably by loading-unloading from plane to plane...no biggy,aerolines people need to relocate 500-600 pcs of baggage in 20 min or so...PS2...will get more of this product...26"" and back-pack.PS3...watch for sale in Kohls etc...don't pay too much even the product is worth it.PS4...32"" looks too big and muscale for most aerolines...don't worry,fits right there,even fully loaded.approved."
2,"Versatile, but can tear at the seams.","I purchased this bag for international travel. It is so much easier to wheel this bag around rather than the large rectangular monsters I usually carried. I have several bruises and scars on my shins from the old luggage. This bag was a easy to pack, practical, and lighter in weight when empty than most large luggage. This is a huge benefit when attempting to pack gifts to bring back home from travel.After only one trip, I was sad to see that the fabric stitching had torn away from the zipper. One pocket on the edge was almost fully exposed (and now completely useless). Baggage handlers today are obviously not expected to handle newborn babies, but it takes a monumental effort to rip a bag in such a way to rip 20-30 stitches! I am going to try and complain to High Sierra and see if they can fix it for free. I will post an updates as the situation progresses. Hopefully the entire bag does not tear away at the seams in the same way."
1,Horrible.,"This guitar is terrible. It can't keep a tune, and plays as well as an armless drummer.Horrible, horrible."
2,Very dissapointing,"The first one I received has a defective bobbin winder, it only wound the bottom half of the bobbin. When I called Singer directly they suggested I hold the thread up with my fingers...They did replace it but the second one is defective as well.The reverse lever that stalls after reversing causing you to release and then re-apply pressure is a pain. It bunches up any material thicker than simple cottons. The light is worthless. My machine sounds like grinding gears and the delay after releasing foot pedal is very annoying.... Would not recommend this machine at all. I have tried to return for refund but singer does not give any refunds... so beware"
5,Didn't want it to end,"As a history buff and a fan of historical fiction, I have a hard time finding realistic but interesting novels. This one fits the bill. It doesn't always protect the lead characters to the point of disbelief and the colorful details allow you to picture the hardships and grime as well as the romance of the era."
2,Thin Plastic Covers,I bought a pair of these for my Load Warrior basket. It's not obvious from the specs but these are thin plastic covers with a metal lock. Some leverage with a screwdriver should break them off. They're better than nothing but pricey for what you get. Try buying one pair and not two as the manufacturer's description recommends and see how you like them.
4,spot the frog,"It is a very cute frog,and you can also play with it in the computer, it is like a real pet!"
1,Racist Trash - Supoorts Child Murder,"Quote for the ""book"":""When you see the photos of corpses of young children being dragged from the Qana, Lebanon rubble, remember: These are not human beings. These are terrorists.""If you think this is literarture, you're as sick as Bovard.---a zero star rating and a waste of worthless federal reserve notes"
3,Street Dreams was alright.,But the remix w/ R. Kelly was much better. Street Dreams the original version was played out before it even came out. Clue and all them other DJ's played it out.
1,It was a lame cd !!!,I think it was lame because nas put a bonus verse when he should have put the remix on the cd. The remix is real tight and I have been dieing to get the song but I can't find it. So that why I thought it was lame
4,Does the job!,"Nice design - it works as intended. You get multiple height adjustments, rollers on the bottom, styling looks. Now all I need is a wireless keyboard and mouse!The fit works well with my HP 15"" laptop.Cons:Perhaps it would have been nice to have a little larger tray to accommodate my docking connector (just fits) but that would have increased the overall size of the unit and likely the price."
4,Delusion via trauma - and lots of suspense,Very good acting. Lots of suspense in this one. The main actress is awesome. She is very talented. I'm not sure if she's beautiful or spooky or both?
2,cheap plastic that split,These are pretty lame end caps. Be very careful inserting then into the crossbars. I used a rubber mallet and some silicon caulk as a lubricant and sealer. Two of the caps cracked anyway. Yakima could do much better. If the caps allow water into the crossbar you will get rust.
3,French Sex Stories,"As understood, this work is a blue-paper forThe Beast, while three sex-saturated segments occurred in royal France, where characters' deed leaved much more to viewers' imagination than was disclosed-and a modern time young people sea-shore session is either rather of interest to psychologists than to an ordinary watcher.A very charming acting and beautiful music add advantages to his work-of-who-knows-what-of.Technically, DVD white shrift English subtitles are hardly seen on a B&W; background."
4,This book is great!,"I haven't had the chance to make very many of the recipes, but, I cantell you this....I want to try almost every one of them. They look andsound terrific. The recipes have ingredients that I love and, for themost part, keep on hand. I'm looking forward to getting startedwith my new adventure in healthy cooking. Thank you for such a wonderful cookbook.TM from Tn"
3,"Good health, a little too gourmet for me","I love to cook, but I have a large family and these recipes are nutritionally sound, but a little more extravagant than I cook. I have Tosca Reno's line of Eating Clean cookbooks and I use them at least 3-4 times a week for different things. Those are more my style, these recipes aren't as family friendly when cooking for kids."
5,"Great PDA, Recommendable.","Great PDA, beautiful design, light weight, excellent screen.I can take pictures, and sent it through internet (with wirelessconnection) in seconds. Plus, lot of software for almost anything.I am a satisfied customer."
5,This is the one youo've been waiting for....,"I'm glad I waited to spend money on a PDA. This is the 2nd generation of this model with a better camera that even shoots video with sound (something I was not aware of). The new Palm OS 5.0 looks and works with ease and this thing will even turn on your tv. It's expandable and has a slot for a much needed Memory Stick if you're going to also want to use this as an MP3 player. Some reviews squak about the battery life, but considering the vibrant color display and sound capabilities, I have no complaints. I put in the the charger cradle daily when I get home and so far I have not been inconvenienced. I'm still new to the PDA world and it's going to be a while before I'm taking advantage of all that this thing can do, BUT, until then, this is the BEST toy I've had so far. :) Make it an early Christmas for yourself, and I recommend getting the 128 MB Memory Stick."
3,Such a Disappoinment,"I was interested in buying a Clie until I looked at the specifics. The built in memory is 64mb, but it also features add in-cards. The biggest add-in card you can buy is 128mb at $80 a piece. So, if you add the two together you get approx 200mb. With 200mb, you can store about 20 mp3 songs by themselves but the Clie also runs word, uses your inbox, etc(which hog space) so you would probably only get in a couple of songs. The smallest ipod now carries 5000mb with the price at approx $350. That is about 14.2mb to the dollar! The add in card features about 1.6mb to the dollar! So, buying enough add-in cards to get 5000 mb would cost $3125.THE BOTTOM LINEIf your going to use lots of storage space, and use ANY mp3s you should really be buying a different product. Thanks, and I hope this gives you some perspective(I also hope my calculations are close to right)."
1,Duplicate?,I noted that this CD (# ASIN: B000CSUWSK) is identical to another with a different cover (ASIN: B000B9VDLU). I had hoped to receive two different sets of songs when ordering them and was surprised to see on the index of songs that the lists are identical. Is the mistake Amazon's or are the two actually the same? Any customers who bought both?
5,Spoonful's Hidden Gem,"In the 60's, Lovin' Spoonful had only two albums released in Brazil, where I live, both by a very small label which represented Kama Sutra: A 'Greatest Hits' album (which I think it was locally compiled) and Everything Playing. 'Summer in the City' received some airplay in the 60's, but I really take notice of the Spoonful work later, in 73 or 74, by listening to the mentioned albums, and I deeply fell in love with 'Everything Playing'. Great songs, like She Is Still a Mistery, Six O'Clock, Forever and Old Folks, great arrangements. The Spoonful has many great songs in its history, but 'Everything' is a different effort, with new directions in it. A must have, not only for the completists, but for all those who really appreciate that unique and creative era - the late sixties."
4,"a must read, especially for current & ex-employees!","These fellows certainly scored a direct hit on the Reuters mothership with their chronicle of buffoonery over the years. Their details are right on the money and very accurate - I was on the IMS front lines from 1987 - 1994 and saw most of the chicanery first-hand. Most every senior manager comes off looking incompetent from Peter ""Blau"" Job on down. The book may be a little hard to understand for anyone who is not intimate with the Reuter business and acronyms; the authors also jump around in time and space too much. But overall the book is a treat to read if only because it reveals how an allegedly fine media company was truly a directionless circus."
2,"Good, but could be better","Some of the suggestions are useful, but many are a little extreme. A true tightwad wouldn't buy the book, but sponge it from friends, the web, libraries etc."
1,Who let the dog out?,"Leave this loser in the doghouse. Pulse monitor difficult to use and when can get a reading, it's way off the page."
2,too much!,"I am not sure if it works or not as I couldn't get it into my dog's mouth enough times. The smell is STRONG-very fishy and very minty. The oil needs to be put in the dog's mouth, I had to put it on my finger and rub on my dog's teeth. She has not enjoyed the oil."
1,PetzLife Oral Care Gel Salmon - worst item ever from Amazon,PetzLife Oral Care Gel Salmon Oil - When I put this gel on my finger my dog left the room. It stinks to high-heaven and no way will my dog touch it. When I forced it on her she coughed until it was all out of her mouth. I would much rather pay a vet to clean her teeth than to inflict this awful product on her.Gloria Carlson
4,"Cats hate it, but it works!","My cats can't stand this gel, but it works. After only a few uses, I noticed a reduction in their plaque build up. They don't spit the gel out like other people said their cats do, but they smack their lips and clearly hate the taste. It's really difficult to get it in their mouths. The best method I've found so far is putting a large dab on a q-tip and swabbing the outside of their mouth -- I can only ever get one side because my normally sweet as sugar girls will start growling. They're both only 7-8 pounds, so I give them a little less than recommended.Considering how much you get, it's actually not that expensive. I don't know if I'll purchase this again, though. I know the bottle will last a long time, and hopefully I'll find something they like better that works in the meantime."
2,Doggie Teeth,Seems to be a good product but my dog is not crazy about it and it must be stored in the refrigerator - which might be why my dog is not thrilled about it.
3,Good product but...,"I prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the salmon flavor better. I figured the extra omegas wouldn't make a difference except to benefit my dog, however, I found that the fresh smell wasn't at strong in this one. Still a good product, but I feel the regular flavor is more worthwhile."
4,...just a good band.,"Jolly Mon is an example of and to all bands who are, and should be, themselves! While other bands are listening with their ears glued to the radio for bits and pieces of ""new"" material, Jolly Mon is remolding music into something that has never been heard before. So many locals get compared to Alice In Chains, Tool and The Cherry Popin' Daddies, and rightfully so - so many locals emulate the style of these greats in hopes of capturing the last 15 minutes of their twylight in stardum. Jolly Mon sets their own rules capturing a melodic, yet hard hitting groove that one may become lost in. The music of ""Nobody Knows..."" is mostly of the ""Acid Rock"" denomonation which draws long, spacy melodies along side tightly compressed base riffs and vocals so in key that it is as if the voice is just another instrument. No gimmics, no hype and no ill-fated attempts at saying something overly profound. Just a good band."
4,1954 Concert by the Vienna Philharmonic,"What a treasure! You can definitely tell this one was recorded many years ago, but I was so glad to have found it. I fills in a blank in my collection from the early years of the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's Concerts."
4,AWESOME,Bought this 2 years ago.Still bring us lots of pleasure.Super comfortable.the drink holder is pretty crappyI have YET to see anything BETTER!
3,wood activity cube,"The toy is nice, but when we received it, the decals of the characters were already peeling off of most of the pieces. Also, on one side, the space isn't big enough for all of the shapes to completely spin around. It is sturdy and has fun things for the kids to do, I just would have expected slightly better for the money spent."
2,unsafe,This product we had to take away as my son would play with the top part and it would come away from the base either landing on top of him or knock him over as it is pretty heavy. the top needs securing someway.
2,Not really worth it,"I bought this to go with my daughter's Sesame Street room. When I got it, I could tell it was cheaply made. Within seconds my daughter had almost pulled off all the stickers. It was still cute but it looked like something a child could of made. My daughter is almost 2 and has played with it maybe twice. So didn't really keep her attention long either."
2,Alright for the price,"For the price, this toy is alright. I have a 2 year old who loves the wooden activity cubes; though she loves Seasame street I would purchase a differnt brand. There are 3 major fall backs. (1) the decals are stickers that come off so easily they just fall off. (2) the top easily comes off if my 2 year tries to lift it, which became a problem because the top is a heavy piece if it were to fall on her foot. (3) the Big bird car keeps eaily popping out of place that I worry my child my put it in her mouth. I am very suprised there has not been a recall on this toy."
2,Activity Cube,"I like the fact that this toy lends itself to imaginative play. However, I was a little disappointed to see that the manufacturer used stickers on many of the smaller pieces. Most of mine have subsequently rubbed off or fallen off. Painting the images on the pieces would have made a more durable toy, especially for busy little hands!"
5,Nice improvement in ride quality,"I love my little 2003 Tacoma, but the ride quality was not up to par with 92,000 miles, skinny tires and worn out shocks. I could see the shiny spots on the frame where the bump stops were hitting. I put some 15 x 7 wheels and 225-70 tires on it recently, which helped with stability and ride, but the new Monroe SensaTracs really made the difference. I wanted a more stable, solid ride, with better dampening of road bumps, and that's what these provide. For this daily-driver I did not want performance handling and a buckboard-stiff ride, and these are nowhere close to that. I've used SensaTracs with success before on other vehicles, and when combined with the Buy 3- Get One free rebate, Amazon's low price, and free shipping, they're a winner for me again. Took about 45 minutes to install. or some reason, Amazon didn't ship the rear shocks as quickly, so I haven't put them on yet- I'm sure they'll make a positive difference as well."
1,"DON""T BUY!!",I had WEBTV & WEBTV PLUS for 10 years and despite some limitations I for the most part liked it. Can't say that for MSN TV 2. Read the reviews cautioning purchase but did not believe them or didn't want to believe them. What a mistake! Believe me if you had WEBTV you will not like MSN TV. Do yourself a favor and keep you your WEBTV!!!
1,A Waste of Money,"MSN TV 2 is huge disappointment to me. You can't write emails or anything else, not only because it skips letters, but because it mistakes a letter keystroke as a command to go to the homepage or search or something else. It's slow, it won't load certain pages, it cuts off for no reason, it won't play videos on YouTube unless you're content to watch 2 seconds pause for it to reload and then 2 more seconds, etc, etc.I've used webtv, now called msntv, since 1997, and I admit it's always been much more limited than a computer, but it's always met my basic needs. However, MSNTV 2 simply does not work right. They didn't test it enough before releasing it.If you want MSNTV, then buy a classic unit. It's limited, but at least you can send email, shop on sites like this one, and surf the net (albeit not all sites)."
1,PIECE OF SHHHHHHHHHHIT,You wudda thunk after all this time- they'd get it right. NO SIR!Unless you can get an old unit (a WEBTV PLUS) - stay away from this and save yourself a lot of aggravation.
3,"Easy to read, good for beginners","This is an easy-to-read and brief guide on the art of decoupage, great for beginners. You'll find basic techniques and tips on how to cut and glue images, frame your work etc as well as some examples to show you how to define and add layers to your work. In addition the author has also covered briefly on the use of different material to create your own work ( eg your own photos). Busy individuals who would like to explore this art over weekends (or with your very limited leisure time) will love this book because it is brief, to the point and practical. However I would recommend this book more to beginners because intermediates or advance lovers of this art would probably find this book a bit too "" basic"" for you. I give this book 3 stars not because it is not good (in fact if I am a beginner, I would probably give it 4 stars or more), it's just because I'm an intermediate ""student"" in this art already so I haven't discovered much new skills for myself from this book."
3,Good book from great writer,"I am a big fan of Cormac McCarthy and ""The Road"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Having said that, this book was just ok. I love the style McCarthy writes in and love the familiarty of reading his stories sat in eastern Tennessee. However, this book is not one of my favorites. The first half of the book jumps back and forth so much it is hard to know what people are talking about or what is going on. The story itself is interesting and keeps you reading to the end to see how it is going to end. Again, love his phrasing and the style of his writing but just couldn't get into this book too much."
2,It's not Faulkner,"It doesn't even seem like McCarthy. Gone are the finely woven stories of the Border Trilogy. This novel feels like an unfinished work, a mere outline to a real McCarthy novel. I was disappointed in the lack of depth of the characters; I never cared about Lester, nor had any inkling as to why he had turned so rotten. I did notice, every now and then, the beautiful prose that the author's known for, but the story was never fleshed out.Don't start reading McCarthy here as one reviewer suggested, it might turn you off to one of the great story tellers of his generation. Start with the Border Trilogy books, you will get a much better sense of the writer."
3,depressing,"If you are feeling good about anything do not read this book...but if you have had some hard times and like beautiful writing..go ahead.. The main character in this book is in such a terrible mess and always goes the wrong way..the book will make your life seem like a piece of cake. Not for youth , not for the shy and not for me."
2,Did I just read a book about a necrophiliac?,"How could this book have been written by Cormac McCarthy? As a tale of a small-town degenerate hooked on murder, necrophilia, and seemingly random violence, it has no redeeming qualities at all. It sounds like a Mel Gibson movie, for goodness' sake. The principal character, Lester Ballad, sets out to explore the depths of human behaviour after his home property is foreclosed and he is falsely accused of rape. He thereafter leaves no dead woman unscathed by his wanton phallus. There is no moral to this story, the reader does not come to empathise with Ballard, and the story is not entertaining. The only good trait to the book is the solid, well-paced story telling."
3,Don't like as well as Seventh Generation,I bought these to try in substitution for Seventh Generation diapers but I wasn't sold on them. They aren't as soft and well shaped as Seveth Generation (in fact I felt like the over size was kind of wasteful). I also didn't think they absorbed as much as Seventh Generation diapers.
5,music for chilling out,"i dont care about the comparisons to other groups [theivery corp, K&D, etc..] I have heard a LOT of electronic lounge and downbeat, and this, simply put, is one of the most colorful selections of the type. the melodies are thick and the basslines are dope. the album [sans the 3 remixes at the end] has a beautiful arc that takes the listener on a sexy journey."
4,Tink to the rescue,"I bought this for my car in april of 2008. It being my first car, I knew exactly what theme I wantedTink and lots of it.When I removed it from the backing, I somehow managed to mangle the face beyond recognition. Granted, it wasn't the easiest thing to remove but I did a number on it.Luckily, I managed to reconstruct the face [right down to the eyes and nose] by piecing everything together pefectly. Looking at it now, you'd never know there was ever an 'incident' - tink looks perfect and she has survived Rain, Wind, Sleet, Hail, Snow and Ice and has held up fine.I do wish the process of applying had been easier, but I am happy with the durability thus far. I didn't want to have to go out and buy another one, and since it is my first window decal for a car I really didn't know what to expect."
1,ALL OMEGAS SOLD ON AMAZON ARE FAKE,"do not spend your money on luxury watches. they will be shipped from Malaysia, and are Fake.there is little recourse - so don't waste your time."
5,"mislabeled by amazon, but still a great watch","Contrary to amazon's listing for this watch, it is not an automatic, but rather a hand-wound mechanical chronograph. Having said that, the Omega 3573.50 Speedmaster Professional is simply a terrific watch. I preferred a sapphire crystal, which is why I chose this watch over the ""actual"" moonwatch (ref. 3570.50, with a hesalite crystal and solid case back). It keeps great time, looks great, and I love the ritual of winding it every morning. If you're considering a high-quality mechanical Swiss chronograph, take a long hard look at this watch. I love it."
3,"Pretty funny, but now wow","It has many funny moments, but overall the humor is crude and the plot weak. You wouldn't miss much if you skip it."
1,glad i didn't see this at the movies,"worse than I expected, should have been rated R R R R R R R R R for foul language."
5,Hilarious!,"Huge fan of Seth McFarland, so I had to watch this movie. I laughed so hard! Loved the Family Guy references too!"
4,"Crass, Vulgar, Stupid, and Perfectly Funny","It's about a raunchy Boston teddy-bear that comes to life and gets high with with his 35 year old best friend when they are grown up. You should know what to expect, and best picture ain't it. However if you like the dry, often sarcastic, humor presented by The Family Guy this movie is hysterical. Despite the funny antics it has a message about responsibility and growing up and actually can strike an emotional cord. Worth a watch or two, just not with your kids."
3,Purchase price incorrect,"First of all I rarely give movies any more than three stars. In todays world, there just arent 4 or 5 star movies anymore.I was looking forward to receiving this today and watching it tonight Dec 11, 2012.At the purchase price of 9.99 I figured I could buy it, watch it and donate it to a library or something.Instead on the delivery day I got an email from Amazon saying the purchase price was wrong. (Checking the site its really $16.99) My order was cancelled and I have to reorder if I still want the item.When I worked for KMART many years ago they had a policy that anything that was not priced right, too low, sold for that price. Would be a good policy here to keep the natives from getting restless.I'll watch it when it comes on FIOS."
4,Funny movie,"4 star rating for comedy. Movie was stupid funny at times, but I like that. Of you like Family Guy, you'll like the movie."
4,Crack up!,"Seth at his best.Grab a beer, sit down w/ a like minded person, turn your brain off, and fricken laugh!"
4,good movie,My wife and I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to other couples. It was funny and made us laugh a few times...
2,Movie got way too silly,"Started out as a funny, raunchy flick, then got lame in the middle and then completely silly at the end. Too bad really, could've been a classic! Two stars...."
4,Friggin funny,"This was a friggin funny movie ! Any family guy fan will loves this , and even a couple of you Flash Gordon fans as well&#128521;"
2,Buy at the store instead,It looks as though this is a burnt copy. I bought it as a gift and it looked as if it is bootleg!
4,It was funny,I did not like the bong sene and some of the lanquage as not to good..Other wise it was intertaining..
3,"Funny, but amount of foul language detracted.","A funny movie with a predictable plot, there was an excessive amount of strong language. enough so that it detracted from the humor at times. Still some funny lines."
1,Honestly the dumbest show ever,"I actually like sophomoric humor, so when I heard this movie was dumb - funny I figured it would an evening of mindless entertainment. It wasn't even funny. We turned it off about 45 minutes into it and didn't even watch the whole thing."
2,ok at best,The movie had a handful of funny parts if you can get past the fact that teds voice is just Peter Griffin with a slight boston accent. The first half was actually kind of funny but the second half was serious and emotional and the jokes were very few and far between.Probably worth a rent from netflix or redbox but not a dvd I'd buy.
4,Better than expected,"From some reviews I had read, was far better than I expected. Lots of smiles, plenty of chuckles, and a few ""wait, I have to pause this, I'm laughing so hard."""
2,"Cute bear, vulger language","The plot is a common one. Boy has toy, toy gets him into trouble, boy saves bear. The movie is'nt even funny. I'm sorry I purchased the movie. Not something I would watch again."
2,"Ted, my friend?","Good premise, could have been much better, lots of funny scenes, some not so much , sure to be a sequel."
1,Just plain dumb,"I thought the premise interesting, but that damn bear was not cute. He was a force for selfish lack of control that was beyond childish."
1,Only watched a few minutes of this horrible movie!,This was nothing but profanity and stupidity. So gross as to be not funny at all. Unbelievable that people watch this and rate it okay.
1,Disappointed,"Wow! The fact that something so precious to kids would be turned into something so foul mouthed. Yeah granted he grew up and became an adult but Damn! The weed smoking could've been left out! This was entertainment for whom?! I was curious and thought I'd give it a chance. Didn't like it, waste of film, hardly funny. At least superman and Spider-Man still follow goodness. These are adult films but we are influenced by what we see just as well as kids. Just my opinion."
1,Dumb dumb dumb dumb humor,"Stupid, if you like stupid you will love it. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Waste of 5 dollars."
1,cant believe I paid for this...,.watched about 10 min and didnt see anything funny about this. Maybe if they didnt drop the F bomb ever 30 seconds you might could watch it but again I cant believe I spent my money on this one
2,More hype than what it was worth.,This movie is a rental at best. The concept was a great idea but it wasn't nearly as funny as I had expected it to be.
1,Movie was terrible,I really thought this movie was going to be more funny with the director's name on it. Kind of was a waste of time.
5,"I don't ever buy movies, but I am buying this one.","I love this hilarious, Very R rated movie. I never buy movies, but this one is special. Could not do anything to improve on it. It is a very funny comedy. That is out of the box, but not to far out. It is so good. My boyfriend never likes movies but we both could not wait till this one came out. I pre ordered it right after we saw it. As soon as amazon offered it."
2,An hour and forty-seven minutes of my life I will never get back...,"I expected a lot more from Mark Wahlberg. Even though there were one or two funny lines, this movie was very disappointing. If you can find humor in a prostitute pooping on the floor and really enjoy stoner movies, you will probably love this movie. Personally, it's just not my type of humor."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I had low expectations for this movie, as I thought the whole concept seemed pretty stupid. And then when I watched it I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes they were so funny. The humor was witty and most I the movie was fast-paced, though it did start to drag toward the end."
2,Completely Overrated,"The laughs are very few in this one. The ending is cheesy as hell, the intro narration is boring, and the film lacks any real laughs. The only reason it's getting a second star is because Mark Wahlberg was actually funny for a change."
2,Meh,"I expected more. It was ok. Great cameos and the random 80's jokes were funny, but Family guy / American Dad / Cleveland show are all funnier."
3,A little disappointing,The funniest parts were shown in the previews. Sad to think that's how we spent our New Years. Mila was great
1,Worst movie ever,All the hype had me so excited to watch this movie. Too much about the love story between Ted and mila kunis and not enough of the Ted story. I was very dissapointed with this movie. It has been my biggest movie dissapointment in a generation!
1,They should have gave him a Snuggles,"This movie was AWFUL avoid at all cost. Especially if you have children.This movie has about everything you wouldn't want in your living room, feces on the floor, teddy bear sex etcThis movie is garbage it needs a negative rating."
2,Not recommended,You can see the funniest parts in the trailer. Rest of the movie is very boring and hardly funny. Not recommended.
1,Ted,"Very nasty movie. I would not recommend it to anybody. I still have it and cannot give it away. Nobody wants it.I would like to sell it, but amazon would not list it."
5,comedy genius!,This movie from start to finish is what true comedy is all about.Seth Mcfarlane and are reminiscing of Richard Pryor and redd foxxand the days of the not ready for prime time players of Snl or sctv and fidays this is what comedy is supposed to be pushing the envelope of life like Sam Kinison didnot like hollywood does today ripping of movie goers with over hyped recycled garbarge they keep reusing over and over thank you Seth for your comedic genius!
2,Horrible movie!!,"Didn't expect much but didnt expect this. Very dissapointed! I'm a fan of mark warblers, and even the comedy aspect of this movie was not funny! Sorry I rented it!!"
1,Disappointing,"""That 70's Show"", ""Family Guy"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" had a love child. A unfunny, horny, pot smoking teddy bear. This movie does not even qualify as B flick. I would not say I hate it, I would rather have my 3.99 back, though. Seth Mcfarlane is usually a lot more interesting than ""Flash Gordan"" on cocaine punching wholes through walls. Unfortunately I do not think after this he will get another chance at a movie. Wow this is a long way from Spawn..."
1,BAD Taste Movie..,NOW this is a sick movie. Teddy Bear is sick. Stupid and sick. If I could give minus stars I would.
1,All the funny parts were shown in the previews.,"So, if you've seen the previews, save yourself the 1.5 hours and do something worthwhile. It was disappointing and the guy just became annoying as the movie went on."
1,If you like cussing...,"All the verbal profanity takes away from the movie. I guess that is why they have it ""unrated."" I would love to have my money back."
2,Movie,"The quality was great, I just thought the movie was stupid! It had a couple funny parts, but it didn't make up for the bad parts"
1,disappointing,"very disappointing especially by a guy who has a top-rated show for several years - ""Family Guy"". The voice change for Ted didn't make any sense as why would a 'toy' change voices. Glad I did it this way as saved me the cost of a DVD/Blu-Ray. Would've given it a half star if that option was available. The only saving grace was the performance by Mila."
3,"Funny, but...",All the best parts are in the previews so if you have seen the previews you will only get a few additional laughs.
4,Worth a watch.,"Most people say this movie is similar to family guy, and they are correct. Seth Macfarland does the voices so they will sound familar. If you like the kind of humor on family guy you will enjoy this movie. If not, you should probably stay away from this film."
1,This is such a horrible movie,"This movie is full of violence, swear words, sex, racism, and all that are not appropriate for a movie with a teddy bear. This is one of the greatest failure of a movie I've seen. I hope this kind of stuff does not get propagated any more."
4,"If you like Family Guy, this is funny","It's a funny movie. Really funny with a good crowd. As with Family Guy, be ready for a lot of references you won't get. This movie probably won't age well, but I do recommend watching it now. One thing Seth always deserves credit for is hard hitting humor."
4,Didn't expect it to be this funny,"When a trailer is hilarious, you kind of halfway expect the movie to fall short of expectations - not so with Ted. If you like the Family Guy, Boston accents and stupid comedy, you'll like this movie."
3,Forgettable,"It was funny but not witty comedy, more like goofy comedy. Not my favorite but somewhat entertaining. No awards know this one."
4,pretty funny but....,The movie had a good story line and brought tears to my eyes laughing so much....but man at the language...
3,Not as funny as I had hoped.,"I was expecting more humor.. The concept is fine and the actors are really good, butI laughed only once. I realize this was more adult themed, but not a movie I will keep, sorry to say."
4,Live Action Family Guy - But touchingly Sweet,You can't get over the fact that the bear has Peter's voice from Family Guy and they address that issue within the script. It's raunchy no doubt but what do you expect from Seth McFarland? It does end on a touching sweet note though that even guys will get and love. I would recommend this movie to any Family Guy fan and to anyone that just wants a good laugh.
2,Disappointing,This movie wasn't that funny. Most of the funny parts were already in the red band trailer. There just wasn't much to it. I expected much more.
1,Too crude,Way too much drug involvement to be enjoyable. This movie could have been really funny without being crude and disgusting.
4,Ted,"This movie is not for everyone,, rather raunchy,, but very funny,, rated R, did enjoy it the second time around."
5,HILARIOUS!,"I saw this movie in theaters and I was laughing so hard my belly ached. I just couldn't stop laughing. It was so random, inventive, funny and even endearing all at the same time. And I absolutely loved the random pop culture references, even though I've never seen Flash Gordon (I want to now!), I appreciated the reference and the cameo! The actors all delivered great performances. This is definitely a great movie if you just want to kick back and have a good laugh."
2,OK,This is an OK movie for adults. I watched it the one time but will not have it in my collection. Not worth seeing more than once.
1,Dumb,We turned the movie off. It was horrible. There were a few funny parts but overall the level of stupidity was too much and we couldn't watch any more. All about a teddy bear and his friend who get high every day and can't grow up. There is a lot lacking in the story line to make it even slightly entertaining.
3,"I expected vulgarity, but........","This was a little over the top when it came to vulgarity. I am a fan of Seth McFarland, but a few jokes were just plain raunchy and I thought I was going to turn it off but then realized maybe it was just that one joke, but the line was repeated a second time. I thought I was open minded, but maybe not so much. I thought the concept of a talking teddy bear was definitely a Seth McFarland trademark and over all was a pretty good idea, just that overall it wasn't a 5."
4,Interesting comedy,This comedy was a bit different but in a good way. Definitely not for kids. I thought it was funny but a bit raunchy at times.
2,"Dumb, even for a Family Guy Fan","I like Family Guy, so I figured a Sth McFarland movie would be great. Even for Seth, I thought it was lame..."
1,So stupid,It was so stupid it felt really awkward to be watching it at times. If we didn't have friends over I would have turned it off. Turns out our friends also thought it was stupid.
5,ted,love this movie. it's not for kids but a very funny movie for adults I laughed the entire time great
3,Okay,I don't think it was funny enough to compete with how vulgar it was. This movie is definitely not for kids.
2,Fell Asleep,"I wanted to like this movie, I am a big Mark Wahlberg fan, but I just didn't think it was that funny or entertaining. Ended up falling asleep in the middle of it."
5,Just weird funny,Love the fight scene. Do not let the kids watch it though it is Rated R for a reason. Lol
1,Huge letdown,The movie was just absolutely terrible. Plot was predictable and the best parts were probably in the trailer. Don't waste your time and money!
1,Boring,"I do not mind sexual jokes and smoking marijuana. However, when these jokes are not funny and very silly, I can not keep watching. We gave up after about 30 minutes. Not funny, not cute."
2,Stupid movie,"I had heard that this movie was funny, so I rented it on Amazon. This movie is great if you are 22 and high. That's about all I can say about Ted."
1,This movie was a waste of time for me.,"Disappointed with the story. This look more than a drama movie for me than comedy. Lack of trama, This movie was a waste of time for me."
1,crap,not even worth the 1.99 for this movie. Not funny at all! It was a bad Family guy episode with a stuffed bear!
2,One joke,"One joke cannot sustain a movie, no matter how cue the lead, nor how cuddly the gimmick. It is still a one trick pony. Rent it for your um, never mind. Rent it for the one joke...."
1,AWFUL!,NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS PIECE OF S____. Can't think of any other ways to say AWFUL waste of time.
3,30% funny 70% waiting for it to be funny again,"If you're into raunchy its good (i laughed). The problem is all the funny parts were in the preview ads on TV, the rest of the movie is mediocre at best. It should have been a 30 minute TV spot not a movie."
2,God Aweful. Seth Macfarlane doesn't have an original bone in his body.,"I've heard so many great things about how funny this movie was. So I borrowed it from a friend expecting it to be as funny as everyone is making it out to be. There were several parts that were kinda funny but not how funny people are making it out to be. The whole movie is pretty boring and its like watching a live episode of family guy. Does Seth Macfarlane have an original bone in his body? Ted (talking bear), Family Guy (talking dog), Cleveland show (another talking bear) and American Dad (alien). Need I say more? They even do the lame cute scene jokes they do in family guy. There is really no point in the movie other than its about a guy who can't let go of the past. If your into tasteless dick and fart jokes and randomly making fun of people and all they do is smoke pot than this may be a movie for you. Other than that.. don't waist your time with this."
1,Non-spoiler alert: nothing to spoil,"This movie falls flat on all accounts. There are a few good setups/one-liners in the beginning as the story is laid out. The story line is pathetic and every bit of dialogue along the way is just empty cliche. Girl dumps boyfriend because he's carousing with his friends, boy realizes love is more important than booze, tries to get girl back. Not even well acted, I felt no chemistry whatsoever. The narrator concept (nice family narrator who ""surprises"" us with an occasional f-bomb or s-pile) is alright but poorly executed. The story is not strong enough even to carry a comedy, and the jokes aren't good enough to overcome the lack of a story. The entire value of this movie was a 10-minute standup routine. Mark Walhberg is an honest, versitile actor but in this movie he is just another one-dimensional hollywood ""star"" not Mark Walhberg the actor. This has to be Seth M's worst effort."
2,Was not that funny,"This movie was just not that funny to me. I dont if its mark wahlberg, but me and my girlfriend might have laughed a couple times literally."
1,Vulgar Teddy,"Crude, Rude, & vulgar. What more is there to say. Thought this would be a fun movie for my Grandkids to watch. Glad I watched it first, they will NOT be watching it."
1,Very dissapointed,Thought that this was supposed to be a comedy - Vulgur and offensive with almost no comedy - do not recommend
1,Don't buy or watch this movie,"If you want to see a movie that has 10 times more bad language then needed, totally inappropriate sexual content, rent or buy this movie. Don't watch it with anyone that is not stoned or drunk, your girlfriend, wife, family, kids, etc unless you want them to be uncomfortable. If you are trying to pay back your mother in law, watch it with her, unless she is stoned or drunk."
2,Dumb,"it was a cute idea, but the novelty soon wore off and the premise became annoying. These are the required words..."
1,It would not play.,I cannot rate the movie itself because we could never get it to play. I didn't see a way to return it or get reimbursed for it either.
3,Guy movie,3 stars only because my husband seriously laughed out loud a lot! I fell asleep (until the next lol)!Guy movie only!
3,For MacFarlane Fans,"If you have seen the trailers for Ted, then you've seen most of the funny bits.Story is trite, but the laughs are big and spread through out the entirety of the film.The humor is aimed directly at Seth MacFarlane's fan base and it will surely hitbig with them."
2,"Love Mark W, stupid movie",Not a movie for kids....but the premise would have better received by a kid. It had a few very funny moments but overall the movie was just plain silly and not in a good way. VERY glad I got it for $1.99!
2,"Okay, we get it, ha ha.","Basically, it's Family Guy with new characters.If you enjoy family guy you won't necessarily love this one. To get laughs, many scenes include alcohol, drugs, and bongs, as if that instantly relates to any audience. Well, to me, it's lame, and not funny when a movie relies a bong to carry it through. Who cares if everyone is a pot head or crack addict. After awhile it is lame, very lame.There were some funny moments; however, The plot was very bland and there was the typical moment where two of the characters break up and then get back together in the end through some nonsensical means.Worth a rental only in my opinion."
5,Ted (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet),I heard Ted (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) was a great movie so i had to buy it.
3,Should be R rated comedy,Dumb comedy. If you don’t mind lots of “F” bombs and sexual innuendo then you’ll get a laugh.Definitely not for children.
2,Don't rent,Lame commercial was better than movie sad stunk bad stupid hurt to watch I want my money back ripoff don't rent
3,Just an excuse to be vulgar.,This is basically Family Guy but with a stuffed bear. Save your money and watch FG on Demand and imagine there is a bear in it.
3,John,The movie was funny but the picture was bad. Not gonna rent from amazon if I pay for blue ray and get standard def
1,Worst Movie that I have ever seen,"This move was the worst movie that I have ever seen, the focal point was nothing but a foul mouth bear. Save your money and pass this movie up..I cannot belive Mark Wahlberg agreed to make a movie like this."
4,Potty mouth teddy bear,"If you like the raunchy humor of Family guy, you'll like this movie.., also worth it to see the beautiful Mila Kunis."
4,Funny!,"Thought the movie was really funny. Ted sounded a lot like Peter Griffin from Family Guy, but they made a reference to that in the movie so it was acceptable. Funny movie. Worth the watch!"
3,saw it after the hype,wish it wasnt hyped up so much. was funny at times but predictable plot with an over the top ending that should have been taken out
2,Dont waist your time,"Fell asleep during it, it was suppose to be stupid funny but I didn't find any humor at all. Dont waste the $$$$"
2,Expected Better,"While there are some funny parts, the movie as a whole is kind of a let down. I found it hard to stay focused on the movie and eventually just turned it off - I expected better from Seth MacFarlane. While I realize the story is about a teddy bear come to life, the story line isn't believable or engaging. I feel as though I wasted my money on this one."
3,Ted unexpected,"In spite of what I knew about this movie, it was still a surprise, mostl;y good. The acting was excellent and the story OK. Ted was a great character and the movie had really funny moments.In the end I was hoping for more but not to disappointed with what I got."
4,Funny & Filthy,"What else would you expect from Seth MacFarlane. Great cast with an unbelievably realistic live teddy bear. The scene with the hookers on the couch with Ted had me laughing so hard my face hurt. What can I say, I love potty humor."
5,Hilarious and a good story,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. While the explicit, graphic drug use might make it unsuitable for some viewers, those who can get past that should be in for some out loud laughs and lots of them. Much of the humor is way over the top and outrageous, but if you appreciate Seth Macfarlane's humor in ""Family Guy,"" you will get it. While I appreciate that animated series, I don't watch it regularly. This movie may get me to begin doing so.The acting is surprisingly high quality and the story holds together well. Patrick Stewart as the narrator makes the movie have an almost Monty Python air of high British satire."
3,Alright,"This isn't as rip roaringly funny as the ads will try to make you believe. However, it's alright to pass the time. I lived in Boston until recently, so it's nice to see the city a bit. Of course there's a scene in Fenway, cause all movies set in Boston need to have a scene in Fenway apparently. That was too much. As it is with so many comedies, it's funnier in the beginning then just gets boring once the plot kicks in."
4,good,overall funny just a few scenes that you can see mark w acted alone and they copied and pasted the teddy bear. They overdid it with him saying dirty jokes otherwise its worth watching
3,Pretty Weak,Nothing too imaginative going on here beyond the initial concept. I was hoping for more. Pretty bland stuff here trying to survive on shock value.
1,STUFFED....,"My cat bit me a few hours before I watched this film.I mention this because half-way through the excruciating90 or so minutes, I had convinced myself that I had adose of tetanus coursing through my body. It was theonly explanation for the sudden appearance of lock-jaw.Truth be told, my mouth was wide open as a result ofabsolute amazement that someone had bothered to makea film that was so puerile, so vulgar, so immature,so vacuous, so unfunny, so tedious, so revolting, sovainglorious in its homage to 'adult' humour, soinsulting, so....arrgh, CRAP!I once was a fan of McFarlane. Now, I only hear smut.Tetanus would have been a better option than havingto endure more than 15 minutes in the company of thisrubbish."
1,Boring,"This movie is boring. None of the characters are worth spending 2 hours with. The story is your usual rambling Seth McFarlane script with no real plot but lots of empty cultural references that have nothing to do with the story or the scene. No one evolves. Nothing happens. While this works fine for a 22 minute episode, it gets incredibly old starting around minute 23.On the plus side, the animation of the bear is incredible. The texture and integration within the scenes is perfect. Too bad they didn't spend as much time on the story as they did on animating the bear.If you love fart jokes, a rambling plot, one-dimensional characters and a well animated teddy bear, the is the movie for you."
2,Good for a SNL skit ... not for movie,"just ok ... some funny parts ... but dragged on for too long. Better for a skit, bit not enough material for a long movie."
2,"If you like fart jokes, this movie is for you","I don't know...Mark Walberg ruined this for me. It wasn't that funny. The bear swears a lot, which is kind of funny to see but it gets old. Tired story line. Mila Kunis is hot. I would take a Steve Carrel movie over this any day."
1,Unnecessary ted,We found ted's profanities unnecessarily excessive. We are not opposed to profanity but the story wasn't strong enough to support the language. After about 15 minutes we stopped the movie.
1,OVER RATED...SORRY,"All the funny scenes are in the previews...and they're not that funny! I'd save your money, and try a smaller, less-publicized film."
1,Not impressed,I regret spending the money and did not enjoy myself at all. I would recommend watching something different or doing something remotely useful.
1,Ted,"Just not really that funny...Sorry Seth - I know you may have talent somewhere, it just didn't shine for me in this movie."
2,waste,A friend suggested to see this movie- maybe I woul dhave enjoyed it more if I had drank at least a 6 pack of beer and a few shots of vodka.
3,Not Bad,"This movie had its funny moments. There were some places where it dragged a bit. I thought the cameos by a few famous actors were pretty neat (even the voice over). Plenty of Family Guy type moments ( I liked), but there were a few times when the jokes fell flat. All in all a decent movie."
2,Too Much Drugs,"I was thinking the movie would be cute for the family, but was very surprised with all the drug use in the movie. It's not a movie for children or people that are not into drugs. Yuck :("
3,Funny a couple times,"It just wasn't very good. A couple good laughs, but they were cheap. The story sucked. I watched the whole thing, but not without a sigh or two."
2,Don't Bother!!!!,"Not at all what I expected..... I thought it would be funnier.... Watch the Trailer and do not rent the movie, you can see all the funny parts from there... Walberg is better than that!!"
4,Very good if you like Seth McFarlane humor,"It is crude, nasty, bad taste, hilarious. Typical for Seth! There were a couple of comments by the bear that were NOT crude that made me roll on the floor, the funniest part of the movie. I guess I share McFarlane's sense of humor, including the goofy songs."
5,Not for kids.,I thought the movie was funny if you dont mind vulgarity and drug use. I would not watch this with any children at any age. I would rent but probably would never buy.
5,Very Naughty,This movie is soooooo wrong and that makes it soooooo funny! Not for kids so put them to bed and get ready for some adult humor!
2,To silly,To immature for an adult but to much adult language for a child. I did not watch the whole thing.
2,Family Guy,It is a family guy movie with less random side stories. The Bear that is cute is just like a friend who has to no problem wasting time.
3,So so movie,I was talked into seeing the movie. Not my kind of show. Had a few laughs but that was about it.
1,unable to watch movie.,"once again,movie played for 20 seconds,then froze up.i tried several attempts to get the movie to play,but player would notoperate after 20 seconds."
2,Not so Good,It started out nice but when it drifted off from Ted to make the couple the primary focus I lost interest in the movie.
2,What do you expect?,"Once again a movie full of ridiculous sexual ""humor."" Cute in places, but way over done.Four more words required."
3,Funny but not funny,If you like family guy you will like the movie. For most people a dumb movie with laughs hear and there.
2,Not Really Funny,"This was like watching Family Guy, but not as good because the regular characters were missing. The voice should have been different. Funny moments but not the great laughs we were expecting."
1,Are you kidding Seth? This is your best?,"It was a waste of money. Just not funny, and could had been better without the vulger language. I exspected better from Seth McFarlene. Let's see what he does with the Academy Awards show."
3,"Solid, funny movie","Entertaining, funny movie. It was better than I expected and is definitely worth a watch. Good joke, but the end felt a little rushed."
3,An ok movie,Not as many laughs as I hoped for. Worth renting but not owning. Once again the best scenes were on the trailers.
3,Pretty Funny Movie... Poor Streaming Quality,"Thought Mark Wahlberg was great. Not a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane, but overall the movie provided some good laughs.More importantly... I'm unimpressed with the quality of the HD stream provided by Amazon. I've got my Panasonic TV connected directly to my router, comcast xfinity internet (not as good as it gets... but definitely should be enough to stream HD over a hard connection), and half of the time the movie is streaming choppy and blurry. If Amazon is going to charge extra for an HD rental... you would think they could provide a slightly better streaming/buffering system to keep a quality stream throughout the entire movie.I thought Amazon's video service would be a better option than Comcast OnDemand... I guess I thought wrong."
3,Fun but not great,"Unfortunately, you see too many of the good bits when you see the trailer. Entertaining, but I don't think I would want to see it again."
1,Never got my problem downloading corrected,"Bought this movie in HD and had trouble getting it to play. Called Amazon support, spent over 1 hour before it was passed onto another group which was to have a resolution in 2 to 3 days. That was 9 days ago and I was told after my checking on it, that they were working on it. I was given a $3 credit for my trouble, paid $4.99 for the rental which I can't watch."
3,Maybe Ted,"This movie was made out to be much more comical than it actually is. I waited for the movie to make it out of theaters, but I should also have waited for it to make it to television. Though some parts were funny, this wss more of a love story. It could be better."
2,Tried too hard,"Seemed like they took the elements of a movie and threw in weird nouns-Ted, and lots of crude verbs to make a mashed up movie."
3,Okay?,It was an alright movie.. Not as funny as I would have expected. I wish I would have waited for at least Redbox
2,Didnt like it,I do like comedy but it got too vulgar and disgusting. A Person crapping on the floor wasn't humourous to me. comedy has to have flow. While the movie continued i was stuck gagging at the still thought of the a person crapping on the floor. Very disappointing movie.
3,Good for a few laughs,"Can't go wrong with a foul mouthed teddy bear. It was good for a few laughs, storyline dragged at times but overall good movie."
1,waste of time and few bucks,"I watch a lot of those ""stupid funny"" movies and didnt have high expecations for this one, but this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I didn't laugh much at all and i have a great sense of humor even a dirty sense of humor at times. But watching this i couldnt wait for it to be over but since i paid for the rental i had to finish it all the way thru. It also didn't help that seth mcfarlene did the same voice as peter griffin, i like family guy and the voice should have been totally different."
1,Horrible!,"No funny in the least, unless you think the shock value of 4 letter words and raunchiness is funny. Don't bother."
4,Funny,I had a lot of fun watching this movie. I'd love to own this bear. Predictable plot but very entertaining nonetheless.
2,ehh,"It was OK but definitely not what I expected from the creator of family guy, which I like pretty well."
1,Waste of time,Thought it would be cute with a sweet Teddy bear....wrong. Very crude. Very disappointing. Nothing funny about this. Don't rent
3,Great visual effects - humor in the toilet,"I don't know which visual effects company in Hollywood made ""Ted"" come to life, but you hardly notice that he's CGI. But the humor of this film is nothing more than d**k and fart jokes. Some of which are extremely funny. Others are cliche. If they had spent as much effort on the script as they did on bringing the talking bear to life, we'd have a great movie. Instead, we get something that appeals more to the ""Austin Powers"" crowd."
2,not what i was expecting at all,"so we rented the""rated version"" and i can't even imagine what the ""unrated version"" would be like... lots of ............... IT IS NOT FOR KIDS.....i was kinda dissapointed on this one markwahlberg........ I like mark wahlberg, but in movies with not so much sexual/swear words. (sorry)"
1,Bad movie,"This movie is the worse movie I have seen in 20 years. Its hard to pick what was worse between a stupid car chase, the gratuitousness use of the F word, or the simply really bad acting. This looked like Wahlberg never acted before -- he is terrible and MacFarlane should keep to 30 min cartoons. It was very difficult to keep watching it to the end. Just painful."
3,Lots of butthole jokes. Some are funny.,"Pretty much what you'd expect if you've watched Family Guy, but with more swearing. If you don't like the humor in Family Guy, you won't like this. Some of the jokes are hilarious, and some aren't. Like Family Guy you also get some recycled stuff that you've pretty much seen or heard before. John's fight with Ted was funny but reminiscent of a few of the Stewie vs Brian, Chris vs Meg shticks. Ted's hot blonde checkout girl has the most annoying accent - you can see why the previews didn't feature her talking! John and Ted make all the good jokes. There are lots of other stars and cameos, but I didn't think any of them added anything. 3 stars for a one-time comedy rental. Not really worth more than one viewing."
4,Ted...,Ted was a funny film. Raunchy but funny. My 70 year old mom was considering watching it. I would not recommend that. Not the demographic that this movie appeals to. Still I think Seth McFarlane's directorial debut is a success.
5,Lots of laughs,Foul but bunny. One of the only movies recently that had me laughing for a large portion of it. Actuallyl managed to hold a decent storlyline also.
4,North Easterner Humor and Christmas Magic,"What if your best friend was a magic teddy bear? This movie explores that particular angle with comedy, from the mind that brought you Family Guy. In fact you might see (or hear) most of the cast from Family Guy in this film. Patrick Stewart's narration is worth the price of admission alone."
2,Meh,This was mostly boring and predictable. I wanted to like this movie because I really like family guy. The only thing that saved this was Mila Kunis.
3,Disappointed,"Mark Wahlberg is great. As a general rule I like most anything he does. Ted (the bear) was excellent as far as appearing to be real and the relationship between the two were a great fit. I think the writing fell short however. The entire storyline was lame.In all fairness it did have a few side splitting hillarius scenes. Ilistened to Wahlbergs interview on Howard Stern, and saw many of the trailers for this movie and was really looking forward to seeing it. Maybe I expected too much."
3,"Silly, as intended. Good for a whole host of laughs!","Not particularly intelligent, but good for an entertaining laugh. Bawdy at times, as expected, with a fair amount of drug use. Very MacFarlanesque!"
3,to long,to long and to much uncalled for language.... not a kids movie at all. i would not tell anyone to rent this movie
4,awesome,Wasn't sure if I wanted to buy the movie because I saw it in theaters so I decided to rent it. For the price to rent it and stream it on your smart tv it was well worth it. Though I might have seen it one too many times and didn't laugh as much as I did when I first saw it.Streaming and renting experience 5/5Movie 3 maybe 4/5
2,Very disappointing. Waste of time and money.,I expected much more from Mark Wahlberg. This is juvenile at best and that would be very generous. Don't waste your time.
4,Funny movie,Very funny movie! Definitely not for kids! I would watch this again but I think it was a little over hyped. People told me it was hilarious. It is funny but I've seen funnier. Still a good watch.
2,meh,If it wasn't the voice of Seth mcfarland it would ve much better.. I can only think of peter griffin
2,Not a favorite,"I really didn't care for this, but otheres may argue that it was just a comedy. I just didn't like it."
5,Hilarious and totally inappropriate!,"Ok, if you are easily offended and generally don't appreciate Seth McFarlane's previous works like Family Guy etc then you will not enjoy this movie. My wife and I however found it to be an excellent, laugh out loud comedy. Apparently we really enjoy low brow humor.Definitely not something I would share with children as it is very R (or Unrated as the case may be) but if you are between 20-40 you will likely be right in the target audience. Probably 30-40 to get the references to some of the 80's culture. :)We started out with a rental and decided that this was definitely worth adding to the collection. On a side note, this version came with redemption codes for both UltraViolet and iTunes... but in the selection process on the site you could opt for an Amazon streaming voucher. Very nice indeed."
3,It's OK,"HiIt was a few hours of a bit of entertainment and the ending was nice, but can still give a Teddy Bear to a young child....I think there's a good chance I wouldn't after seening TED."
1,hate it,"stupid, stupid, stupid, not wasting time with sixteen more words.now I remember why i do not do reviews.5 more minutes wasted."
3,This was decent,"My 8 year old niece was begging me to rent this. I really didn't want her watching it but I would rather her watch it with me than any of her other family members. Thankfully there were some jokes that went over her head, and even mine too. But it was a decent and kind of cute movie. I would watch it again. I probably wouldn't pay to watch it again, but I would watch it again. Beware of the profanity. If you do not like profanity or have children in the room while you are watching this, be prepared to use the mute button often."
1,"Rude, crude, & socially unacceptable","I should have known better when my 19 year old daughter and her boyfriend rented this movie, and it lived up to my expectations...rude, crude, and socially unacceptable. I Didn't care for it. Colossal waste of time!!"
1,TED is garbage,Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen in years.The target audience was too small.Was not for adults and written for the younger adolescents.Therefor should not have been produced with the foul language.Mark Wahlberg is a good actor and should have passed this one by.
1,ughh,Nor funny. Obscene stuffed animals is not my thing and the comedy was just low. No stars is not an option.
4,Hilarity ensues,"This movie is hilarious despite all the funniest moments having been in the trailers. They do a good job of editing the trailer so there are still a few surprises. It was like watching a live action movie version of an episode of The Family Guy. Very funny movie. I didn't give it 5 stars because for one, the trailers kind of give away too many of the funny parts. Two, Mark Walberg sort of over does the Boston accent which is odd because he's supposed to be this Boston home grown star. Ans lastly as a stickler for cinema editing I couldn't overlook the one part in the party scene with Flash Gordon where Mark Walberg's character ""Johnny"" calls Ted Johnny.Definitely worth seeing but so much prfanity please don't let your youngsters watch it."
4,"Funny, a bit raunchy","I enjoyed this movie very much, even though I am often not thrilled about scatalogical humor in many movies. This one has a bit of heart along with the laughs and the raunchy bits."
3,Juvenile movie for the GenX generation,"Very unique concept a boy/ man with his childhood Teddy bear. Gross humor at times, but reasonably good acting. Good viewing if you want some laughs and a light story."
2,Underwhelming,Mostly ridiculous and completely predictable but if you just want to watch something silly and meaningless this one is for you
2,Family guy 2.0,"Jokes were lazy and same old Seth Macfarland comedy. I like Seth Macfarland's stuff, but this movie was just comprised of jokes that could've been on one of the animation shows. Movie .concept was good but plot wasn't. In all, not to much to speak of."
5,Funny $&@!,I watched this movie twice and it was just as funny the second time around. Ted does sound like Peter Griffin though.
4,"Hysterical, juvenile humor from Seth MacFarlane","The unrated version is great, but probably not for your kids. If you want to laugh and be entertained, this is a nice surprise!"
1,Ted,I know others have rated this higher but I thought it was poor at best. It relied on cheap laughs that would be funny only to someone who paid for the movie and was laughing to justify it. Bathroom humor abounds. The premise had promise but the screenplay did not live up to it.
5,Love Ted,"Amazing unrated version. We laughed even more than the movie theatre. We got to see all the alternate scenes, and we love it!"
3,Ehh,I love the stars in the film however it was a strange movie. There were some funny moments but I wasn't falling out of my chair.
3,Interesting yet funny,I thought it was well done but not one of my favorites.The reason I wanted to see it was the actors and actressesIn it. But I definitely think all ages could appreciate this movie.
3,Good Movie,"It is a good movie. Not the greatest, but has its funny parts. There are some stupid parts also. That is why I only gave it 3 stars."
3,Nice Funny Movie,"I think this movie had to much profanity. Too much swearing, more than comedy. I guess may be I didn't find swearing combined with comedy funny."
3,it's ok,It was alright but i was def expecting it to be alot more funny...not kid friendly tho! It's def a movie for adults.
3,I expected too much.....,"Being a huge ""Family Guy"" fan I really had high hopes for this movie, unfortunately it wasn't that great. The plot was lame and totally predictable, and the funny parts were few and very far between making the movie seem longer than it is, I.e. hurry-up-and-end so I can get on with my life sort of feeling. Not a total waste, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,Not Funny!!!,What were Whalberg and Mila Kunis thinking? I hope they got paid well!!Even the sappy ending could not savr this movie!
4,Great movie...,Not for little children and can be watched again and again. Find something I missed each time I view it.
5,Loved It!,"Except, maybe the advertising should be a little more explicit. This is not for kids. That took some of the fun out of it for me. There were two couples in the theater with children around 8 or 9. The trailers are so cute with a cuddly teddy bear, but for sure this is adult pleasure. I feel that maybe if they did not realize how mature this was, they should have taken their children and left."
1,"If you want to see two hours of ""The Family Guy"" you'll love this movie","This movie is foul. I think the rated version might not have been so bad, but an hour and fifty-three minutes of adolescent humor was really more than I could take."
1,Do NOT buy this movie,"I like lots of movies - even if they're kid movies, or stupid movies, I'm pretty tolerant. But this is in the top 5 worst movies I have ever watched in my life. I'm hardly a prude and don't mind a little profanity, but holy cow this movie is over the top with bad language, extreme profanity, and piggish remarks and jokes that aren't even funny. It's as if they think a bad or sexual word makes something funny. It doesn't. True humor obviously escapes the writer and the sad people who produced this. As for the plot - oh for pete's sakes a child could do better. I kept watching hoping it would get better. Don't make that mistake - it doesn't. In fact, don't watch it at all, it's a complete waste of time and money."
3,Great Movie,"Kind of a cross between a kid and adult movie, maybe leaning more towards the adult side. It was a great movie and hilarious."
2,Not impressed.,"I was looking for a stupid, funny movie - something to watch and get a laugh at without too much thought. This wasn't it - it tried too hard and just wasn't that funny."
1,disappointing,"Maybe it was because of the hype, maybe it was because I had high expectations, but man this film was disappointing."
1,Terrible,I could not watch a foul mouth bear past 30 minutes. I did not laugh. Definitely not my sense of humor.
5,Just the right amount of immaturity...,Its a very nice balance of clever and fart jokes. Super funny! However it is weird hearing Peter Griffin's voice coming out of something so cute.
3,Not Bad,"This was a fairly funny movie. It was above average, but did not have me laughing alot. Worth watching again."
1,Requested Refund,Only watched about 5 minutes of movie. Languange so ofensive that we turned off and requested refund from Amazon. Very Disapointed.
1,Ted,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was stupid and the worst language. I would not recommend this movie to anyone!
2,Gets old,"After the initial shock value of a bong smoking teddy bear wears off, Ted gets old quick. A tired story line of guy has girl, guy loses girl to buddy, guy gets girl back. It's an ok movie but not really that funny."
1,Waste of Time - Not Kid Appropriate,"I would have been mad if I paid $14.99 to watch this or had kids! I love Mark Wahlberg, but this film was really bad. DO NOT WATCH WITH KIDS! Boys ages 17 - 25 might find the drugs, non-stop swearing, fighting, and sexual innuendos funny, but even my husband said he wouldn't have rented it if they had shown just one of the scenes in the preview. Essentially, the main character has a conflict with growing up and choosing between his best friend, a pot-smoking, womanizing teddy bear, and advancing the relationship with his girlfriend."
1,It sucked.,The movie had no real plot and just unnecessary fowl language.I actually liked Bad Santa more than I liked this movie.
2,So not funny...,"I got one good laugh at the end of the movie when Ted wakes up after being torn apart by the field medic from Saving Private Ryan and it was a joke about Ted pretending to be disabled. My 13 year old self would've died at that joke. The rest of the movie was just not particularly funny or endearing. And, I say that as someone who laughed pretty hard at the joke about disabled people. Also, couldn't Seth McFarlane come up with a voice that doesn't sound exactly like Peter Griffin?"
3,"""Cute"" premise but raunchy in its execution","Ted the teddy bear growing up with his childhood friend whose wish brought him to life is a cute premise. However, Ted grows up to be a real scumbag and that's not cute or funny."
2,Uninspired,"This is a weak story designed as a star vehicle for Seth McFarland. The novelty of a talking teddy bear with a dirty mind wears off after the first 15 minutes or so though, and then you're left with a bunch of weak jokes, Family Guy-style references that seem out of place without their usual accompanied jump cuts, and boring plot."
2,boring after the first 10 minutes,"I started to watch this because I like Mark W, but after the first 10 or 15 minutes I gave up. Parts were funny, but it had so little story it wasn't worth the time to watch it."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a juvenile stupid comedy. Mostly because thats what all the previews feature. It started out that way and I laughed several times. As the movie progressed, the whole story changed into a bad love triangle soap opera between Ted, Mark Walhberg and his girlfriend Mila. I stopped laughing and started groaning. If you're looking for silly stupid comedy, look elsewhere."
3,Funny at times,"It tended to be over the top though. There were times where it was just too much. But overall it was ok, funny enough to rent for sure."
3,strange idea,"this movie was just weird to me...the talking bear smokes, drinks, and has sex with women, idk, I like Mark Wahlberg. But this movie was very strange, and tried way to hard to be funny and shocking. Not my kind of humor...it was the same crass humor as family guy, so if you like that show, you may enjoy it."
1,Awful movie,This movie was terrible. I only watched it because it was my husbands night to choose our movie. The language and humor was awful.
5,Adult humor,"This movie is very very very very very ... very funny. If you like adult humor, you will love this movie."
3,Great with a few drinks,"Gutteral humor, great with friends and a few drinks. Basically a family guy movie in close to real life. Its missing Quagmire and cleveland sadly."
1,watch it if you like stupid and vulgar,"I guess it was considered guy humor? If that guy is a young adult male. My 23 year old daughter my husband and I all hated it, our 26 year old son liked it, and was recommended by him."
1,Ick,This one just plain insulted my intelligence which I should have known but guess we just had to prove it! Gross
5,funniest movie ever,"for years i thought Airplane was the funniest movie i ever seen. young frankenstein, blazing saddles and the roast of william shatner, a must see roast. but Ted is just hysterical. the extras are great."
5,Awesome!,"It was very funny and lite! It was a fun movie, and not to serious. Mark Wahlberg is such a good actor!"
3,Shoulda waited for it to come on HBO,It didnt suck. It just wasnt as good as I heard it was. Probably best suited for men. It seems like boy humor.
3,TED,"HAS MANY FUNNY MOMENTS. DRAGS IN SPOTS. ALL IN ALL, IT'S WORTH WATCHING. THE FILM IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE SOUTH PARK, TEAM AMERICA AUDIENCE, OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER."
2,Juvenile,I knew going in that it was juvenile but I did not think it would be so over the top silly.
2,Didn't like it,To much vulgar language.If I would of known it was like this I wouldn't of rented it. Would not recommend it to any one
5,Good movie,I watched it the other night with my son we both loved it funny with a good story to back it up
4,Fun to see,I liked most the politically incorrect humor.Beautiful and good actors.Predictable and a little too heavy on fart jokes.
3,Funny,"This movie was funny not as funny as I thought it would be as I am a Family Guy fan.I thought the acting was not that good but could be due to the directing, maybe he should stick to cartoons.Overall worth the watch."
2,Poor use of language,"Story line might be OK, but the copious occurrence of swearing made the movie unacceptable. We may have watched 15 minutes before giving up on it. A waste f our money."
2,Not as good as the previews,"As a fan of Family Guy, I thought from the previews for Ted that it would really enjoy the movie. My wife and I tried to see it in the theater thinking we were out of luck because it was sold out. I wasn't expecting amazing cinematography or a touching story, just hilarity, but when we finally had time to watch the movie and rented it from Amazon it just seemed tired and was a struggle to watch all the way through."
4,Better than expected,Came in half-hearted but wanted some comic relief. Delievered and more. Was very funny and just serious enough to close the plot.
3,"Based on others' ratings, I thought it would be funnier","It was funny and clever in spots, but I expected it to be funnier. It held my attention -- mostly. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list."
4,funny and stupid,More of a guy movie most girls I know would not like this movie. great movie for guys. Funny and at the same time stupid.
3,Dissapointing but worth it all the same,"I must say I am dissapointed with VP Records and JR Kelly. Thought I was going to be getting something fresh here. A bunch of old tunes. I guess this one was being sold on the popularity of ""Love so nice"". Still a couple of Boom tunes there with Kelly switchin' it up a bit with a nice acoustic effort, the Brian & Tony Gold track WILL grow on you and a couple of the bonus tracks no mek it. AS usual, worth the money same way. Sunshine/Hungry Days are my fav tracks. Best thing is that it is a cd full of positive energy and upliftment. Definatley holds it's own in the collection. Blessed Love"
4,great cd great songs,this cd is a great one. some of the songs are a little slow. not up to kelly's standards but great none-the-less. the best tracks on this album would definately be Sunshine and Hungry Days. Jewel of the Nile has a nice dancehall touch to it. i would definately recomend you buy this cd.
3,VERSUS DIRECTOR HAS SINCE DONE BETTER!,"VERSUS was a good start, but since this movie, he has directed a much better film - AZUMI.Versus was a warm-up compared to Azumi. Where Versus lacked in storyline and character development, as well as better action, AZUMI picks up and runs away with it!But he has yet to reach his peak, however. AZUMI, though better than Versus by far, still has some way to go. But he is surely getting there."
1,This is awful and extremely boring,"An incredibly boring awful movie. I regret having wasted $4.50 to rent it, based on its advertising hype."
1,"In a long line of bad movies, this was the last straw!","Do not get me wrong, I am an Otaku. I loved the novel Battle Royale and have watched over 100 foreign movies. But this story has been told over and over again. Reincarnation of brothers one good and one evil and the plight to save the girl before the door the the evil world is opened. Nothing new is added, the fight scenes mediocre. As good as the anime Nazca, no less no better."
3,"""10 skinny guys doing Kung Fu fighting in a haunted forest""","""This movie is simply 2 hours of 10 skinny guys doing silly Kung Fu fighting in a haunted forrest.""Thus spake another reviewer. And it is. So why haven't you rented it yet? How can you resist a tag line like that?There's more, though. For one thing, some girls go kung-fu, too. It's also got Matrix zombies with guns. And a crazy gangster in a sharp black suit. So watch it, why dontcha! It's still better than half the movies Hollywood will release in 2004!"
1,Totally Disappointed,Words cannot describe what I saw in this movie. It reminded me of Dracula. I was so disappointed because I purchased the movie based on the amazon.com reviews. I see a few more reviews have appeared since I last viewed this area.
2,I really wish I could have at least liked this one.,"I picked this movie up for a song around 3 years ago with the understanding that this was a ""great zombie film"".I was sadly disappointed as I wasn't impressed by the zombies, fight scenes, story, special effects, or characters.I believe this might have been a half decent Anime movie if they had made one instead of this low budget dreck.I really wasn't impressed with the cliche, moody, and sword wielding main character.Fans of Kung Fu movies may enjoy this... it wasn't my thing.I enjoy many Asian films and many low budget zombie films... this just isn't one of them."
5,Outstanding emotional summary of USC campus life ca. 1970,"Pat Conroy reminds me of the professor who taught me Advanced Grammar at USC back during my senior year. His anecdotal introduction to the class was ""If you came in here looking for a seminar in semicolon, you're in the wrong class."" He proceeded to make the English language come alive by describing all the rich history of the the costal dialects: especially gullah.The most intriguing element of the novel is Conroy's development of the true emotional realism of events on and off campus before, during and after the 1970 campus disturbances. The characters (particularly the 'Aware' members) were as familiar as my old worn Shakespeare text. Jack Ashley would have been delighted to read this novel in all its contovoluted complexity.It serves as an epic for those of us who grew up during the sixties and graduated around 1971."
4,"Excellent, poignantly constructed novel.","Although nowhere near the standard of the masterful ""The Lords of Discipline"", ""Beach Music"" is well worth the time it takes to get through its 800 pages.Conroy has a great style, with his words flowing off the page towards you with an almost - but not quite - contained fury. Featuring a major cast of characters, all full of depth, complexity and humour, this heartfelt novel has an obvious autobiographical tone. The main theme of the love of family and true friends is extolled in a truly passionate manner, but never reaches into the mellodrama that would of spoiled the novel's tone.Highly recommended."
2,"First time Conroy reader, little disappointed","I am always looking for new authors and tried Pat Conroy upon recommendation. I usually buzz through books, but had to push myself to finish this. The writing style jumped around in this book at some points quite crude and at others having literary text beyond casual reading. The storyline jumped around to the point of not being believable. 4 different characters being sexually assaulted in one book is a little much and really lacks imagination. I will think twice before picking up another Conroy."
5,Wonderful book!,"I almost put this book down when the first chapter became too descriptive but fortunately I did not! I laughed, I cried and I became totally immersed in the character's lives. I was sorry when the book came to an end and I look forward to the next Pat Conroy novel."
2,Too Depressing!,"Beach Music is one big whine. Bad parents, bad marriage, bad life, except for the daughter. Couldn't finishit. Not enough good to get over all the depressing life stuff."
1,Beach Music may be the worst book that I have ever read.,"So much of this book was unbelievable, beginning with the characters' names - Ledare, Shyla, Tee, John Harlan, Dallas - what kind of names ARE those? The scene with the four friends lost at sea for two weeks was completely unbelievable, and became laughable when the boys were rescued by holding on to the antler of a swimming deer that led them home. The scene where Jack was in the hospital bathing his mother and shampooing her hair because she had become violently ill;shouldn't he have called a nurse? It's frightening that such a book could become a best seller."
1,this book is terrible,"I have read all of Conroy's previous work except ""The Boo"" and this takes the cake. He needed a better editor. How he does run on. What DIDN'T happen in this book? Suicide, the Holocaust, the Vietnam War, horrible dysfunctional childhoods, where no one loves their parents... There are so many alternating themes - any ONE of them explored in greater depth and with tighter writing would have made a better story. It was boring. I can't tell you how many pages I skipped over.If you want to read a really great Southern writer, read William Styron, especially ""Lie Down in Darkness"". I have always thought Conroy ripped off that plot (certainly elements of it) for ""Prince of Tides"". The deal is that Styron did it first and much better."
2,"Painful, dull slog thru first 400 pages.","This was my first Conroy book and it will be my last. The only reason that I stuck with the book through he first 400 painful and dull pages was because my sister in law, whom I respect, recommended this book to me. The characters are flat and nasty for the most part - a bad combination. Pat Conroy would have flunked any high school grammer test and I was entirely sick of his clumsy similes. The low point for me was when a female character in the book, who barely escaped the holocaust and retained her European Jewish childhood culture, used the words ""did me"" to describe her rape by enemy soldiers.The only reason this deserves any stars is for the final 150 or so pages when the main characters come together to face the truth about their lives and feelings."
1,You're crazier than John Hardin if you like this book. . .,"Finished the book but grew tired of the flowery prose, idealistic characters and unrealistic plots, the self-indulgence of Jack and the perfect women in his life (Leah, Shyla, Lehare, Lucy), the not-so-witty banter among family and friends, the portrayal of the South as if the people were so unique and from another galaxy...The list can go on, but really, I wasted enough time on this book; I'm eager to move on to something that touches me rather than annoys me."
3,Gifed writer but...,"Pat Conroy is a gifted writer. He has the ability to weave full length stories on each of his characters in a single novel. While the central character is Jack, the plot involves many of his family and his friends in detailed recounting.Conroy's books would not only make for a mini series but for a weekly drama.Despite his talent, so much of this story, with its varying scenarios, is difficult to fathom. I tried and was not totally satisfied. Many vignettes were overdone, painful to plod through and difficult to accept.I believe that Conroy purposely creates his stories this way. I believe it is his way to present his personal writing ability and intent."
1,799 pages of condescending drivel,I struggled through every line of this book hoping something would jump out to make my time and money spent on the book worth it. It didn't happen. It is a most unbelievable plot with unlikeable and uninteresting characters.
4,Good,"I had to read this book for a social studies historic novel project. It was slow in the beginning, but as it progressed, it became increasingly more intersesting. If I didn't have to read it for school, I definately would not have read it.This book gives you a lot of information and it seems to be very realistic and at some points you feels as though you yourself are in the scenes and there with the main characters.This book is very understandable and I recommend it for children ages 11 and older because there is death and violence all throughout the story."
4,Taste good,"Three of my 4 kids like the taste of these. they are very sweet, I think they taste good too. I was disappointed they dont have any sodium ascorbate which is a more easily digested form of Vit C, I should have checked it before ordering. But the price is great - its a HUGE bottle!"
3,Gucci Rush,"The order arrived just fine but the fragrance is not for me. I'm not putting it down, it's just not a fragrance that I would use."
5,Gucci's Rush- Trial size,I hate spending a lot of money on products that smell awlful. Buying a trial size option let me try it and this fragrance is my new favorite!
2,BAD BOOK,"This is one of the worst exam prep. book i've ever seen. IT doesn't even cover all of the material, materials which are imperative to the test. The info. in this book is presented in a very unorganized way. They need to reorganize this book in a manner which will be easily understand by an amateur/intermediate reader. Plus, it only spend like 130 pages for hardware. Just buy David Groth's 700 pg. for the hardware part. If u already know ur stuff, then you can just skim through this book..other than that, i have no use for this book."
4,Can Pass with this book,"I bought this book based on the reviews written here. It did deliver as promised. I passed with an 87 and an 89. Would like to have done better but I passed. This book is all I used but I was somewhat familiar with computers. It does have alot of inconsistent data from section to section such as in the Core part it says systems files start in such and such an order in DOS, Windows 3.x and Windows 95 and in the 95 sections it gives them in a different order and says this is the order in which they load. Still not sure about that one. It also list a 486 as the minimum for running Windows95 while the book I am currently reading lists it as a 386. All in all it is a good book and you can pass both tests using it alone just double check any confusing data with another source. You can also check Exam Crams website for a listing of known errors so you can correct them before you start studying."
4,Not the best exam cram...,"Good book, but I don't think it is nearly enough for the true exam. I would pick up Mike Myers book also and use that as more of a study review."
4,Core only?,"Although I read this book and must say, it was more than enough info for the core module. I thought it lacked the material on the Windows/dos module for the exam that I just took and passed. There are only two chapters devoted to windows and a whole chapter for Windows NT, that was not even on the exam! Know your way around explorer and device manager for the windows/dos exam! Being that windows 95 covers about 75% of the exam,I found that a good Windows 95 book for the MCSE exam is the ultimate way for passing the windows exam."
3,So-so.,"A decent, if a little outdated, overview that glosses over some concepts, and provides too much details on others. Best used as a second source to something like the superior A+ Certification Guide by Mike Myers.."
5,All you need for test.,Read this book and take all the practice tests you can find on the web and you will pass the test with flying colors.
4,Great but not Excellent,"I thought the book was good and it gave some very good information realted to windows knowledge in general. I liked how the topics were laid out. You can quickly bone up on a section you may not be clear on. However a lot of the material was not and did not have a chance to be on the exam. ie. the history of Windows and 8088. However in their defense it was relevant info for the big picture of computer knowledge. I also studied peter nortons win 98 book and other books. Overall I studied much more than I needed to for the exam. The hardware part was fair. The windows/dos part was more challenging. As others mentioned, know your windows3.1 and 95 well and know how to get around. For me hands on experience was a major factor in me passing/ 84 on both tests. If you have not hands on you will have a tough time probably.STUDY HARD. It's not free.... Good luck..."
3,Operación Damas...,"Damas Gratis otra vez con otro buen CD. Contiene grandes temas como: La Pikadura, Ké Dificil, Alza las Manos, Quieren Bajarme, El Churro Verde etc. El último tema 13 ""Tool Mix"" es una variante de una sola canción. El Tool Mix es tan solo una variante de la canción Alza las Manos. Este CD es mejor que el 2*1 Damas Gratis y Pibes Chorros. Una mejor opción."
5,Funny!,I love this movie. It is my favorite holiday movie. Fun for the whole family. Better than the original in my opinion.
2,"1,2,3 strikes your're out!!!","Woowee! Is this one a dud. Suddenly a kid named Kevin who looks nothing like the original, and suddenly has chicken pox is left ALONE at his home as usual and is intruded by some European freaks looking for some stupid chip. The acting probably ties with Manos Hands Of Fate and anything from Mill Creek. This stupid kid Alex d whatever is retarded. He looks like a 2 year old disguised as a 9 year old. His career has not gone well and it didn't start well. It is ok if you are having movie night with your 3 year olds that will fall asleep after the first three minutes. Overall if you don't know what to watch and it's between Manos and this, you will need to think awhile."
4,"Goodbye Kevin, Hello Alex!!!","This sequel is very different than the original two! It's not bad, but you have to be open-minded. Four criminals hide a computer chip in a toy car. At the Airport, they lose it and Miss Hess takes it to her home in Chicago. They need to search every house in order to find it. Miss Hess gives the toy car to Alex Pruitt. When Alex sees the criminals searching homes, he calls the police, but they arrive too late. When no one believes him, and his mom leaves him at home, alone, he starts setting up the traps to stop the bad guys! They are very awesome traps! He receives help from his brother's parrot, and his mouse, Dorris. I highly recommend HOME ALONE 3!!!"
1,"One's A Charm, Two's Great, Three's Overdoing It.","I thought the first two movie were great. This movie had nothing to do with the first two. Not only did Maculy Culkin not return (A big drop), neither did Harry and Marv (Another big drop). You think they at least bring the crokes back so they can try something new, like trying to outsmart a new kid. Don't support this movie unless your buying it used. And even then I don't recomend it."
3,An Average Home Alone,"It doesn't equal up to the original Home Alone with the hilarious Joe Pesci an Daniel Stern as the crooks. This one has stupid crooks which are not as funny as the original. On the bright side, the kid is good in it, but again, not as good as Macaulay Culkin. At best, this movie is just average."
1,Stick with the first two.,"Alex D. Linz play Alex Pruit a 7 year old boy at home with chicken pox. Meanwhile a group of spies are after a powerful computer chip and believe it's hidden inside a remote-control toy car. Home Alone, The spies attempt a burglary at the next door neighbors. Alex calls police. They search the house,nobody there. So his family doesn't believe him. Kinda like the boy who cried wolf. So Alex must now set some traps and catch these spies himself. I like the story, but it's just not Home Alone without Macaualy Culkin, and the Mcallister family. So yeah I would probably skip this one."
1,i seriously disliked this movie alot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie made me cringe alot i thought going into this movie with a open mind and this movie did not meet my expections at all i totally disliked this movie alot in the end tho i actually hated it and despised it do not buy this movie at all buy a book or cd instead of this lame movie
3,Ok but not good,"Home Alone 3 was ok for a Follow up.But as a Sequel it reeked.First off Kevin was better and could take on those 4 new crooks by himself.Second At least have Harry and Marv come back.The race car chase was so fake,the car would of gotten stuck.Though the movie is still good for rainy days and if your bored."
4,puppy sheet set,the sheets are just as they described except they are still stiff after washing them otherwise they are nice sheets.thank youAmber Leschewski
1,Do Not Buy This,Within a week the bottom exploded out with a BOOM spraying olive oil all over the kitchen and scaring the #$%! out of me.
5,A true classic!,"Until I bought my own copy of LeMans, I was forced to try and catch it on the obscure channels at 2:00 am. Now, I can watch it at my leisure and turn the volume wayyyyyy up - thereby scaring my cats and irritating my wife - and just close my eyes and soak up the sounds of those glorious Porsche and Ferrari engines at full chat. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Outstanding!"
1,too boring to watch,"Well, so I expected a story with the famous race as a background. Wrong, no plot, and probably less than 5 minutes of dialogue in the entire movie ( if you don't count the background Le Mans announcer, incongruously speaking English). Now, maybe a documentary about the race would be OK; but this movie did not have either the continuity or the information content of a documentary. Just endless clips of cars buzzing around, punctuated by the occasional crash. The only place in the movie I was curious -- when Steve McQueen's character ended up behind a non- racing regular driver going about 30 mph (why was this car on the road?) they did not answer."
4,The best RACING movie to date,"Forget the weak, simplistic love story, forget the hokey rivalry plot, this movie is about the hardest race in the world and the myth and magic surrounding it. One day, 24 hours, flat out, man and machine competing to see who breaks first. McQueen loved both acting and making this film and it shows in the little touches, like the carnival and campground surrounding the race and the people who come to see the greatest race on Earth, the 24 Hours of Le Mans....Plus, with Dolby Surround running though a home theatre system, the banshee war-cry wail of a Porsche flat 12 engine will raise every hair on your body straight out!"
3,Quant by Quant,"I owned the original book printed in the 60's and loved it ! This rendition has the wonderful story of Mary Quant,but is missing many of the pictures offered in the original book,and the quality of the paper used is of poor quality,and the cover is very flimsy,making this books shelf life limited.I still enjoyed reading this autobiography again."
1,Gross & Cheap,"Yeti: Love StoryIf your into disgusting bathroom humor that involves vomiting, lots of oozing fake blood, externalized fake intestines, drugs, boring/predictable/ignorant/juvenile dialog and behavior, very poor special effects, then this movie just might appeal to you. The camera work is very shaky at the start, and the mask and costume of the Yeti is so obviously fake, as most of the effects are.I read 4 reviews prior to purchasing this turkey that rated this movie at 4 and 5 stars, and that's why I thought that this might be worth a look, against my better judgment. If you have any reservations, think about it ... at the time that I'm writing this there are almost 10 times more DVDs of this movie available, opposed to the number of reviews written. Hopefully this saves you some time, money, and frustration."
3,Title for book 2?,I don't understand which title is the second in the series. There are TWO books listed for #3. I like to read a series in order and can't figure out which one comes next. Help?
1,I'm so sorry I didn't read these reviews first,"I am terribly sorry that I didn't read reviews on this product. I had a very minor yeast infection, it seemed like it was going away by itself but I wanted to make sure that the bacteria was gone. I tried Monistat1 and I have never been in this much pain. Extremely red, extremely swollen and I feel like I have to pee every two seconds. Now I have to take a day off of work which will cost me $100+ including the price of the product. All of these horrible reviews are true..."
1,Awful Experience,"After suffering a day with what I thought was a yeast infection, I went to purchase Monistat. I was relieved when I saw this product because is said ""1 Day"". Knowing the misery of the itching and burning of a yeast infection, I quickly made the $ 20.00 plus purchase. Even though it said to use day or night, I waited until night time. I woke up several times during the night with extreme burining and itching - much worse than the initial yeast infection. It is now mid day and I am completely devestated. The pain is almost umbearable. I showered to try to get relief and am still in pain. I sent my husband to the store for the 7-day treatment. I can't go myself because of the burning and itching. I will never use this product again and highly feel it should be discontinued. I am very tolerable of pain, but this one is awful. NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN."
1,terrible product!,"I am a first time user of monistat and I was highly disappointed with the results. I was suffering a minor yeast infection and decided I would try monistat 1 to get rid of it. I inserted the ovule around 11am and about 4 to 5 hours later while at work, I started feeling really itchy and burning which was fine untill it became so unbearable, I was in tears. I had to ice it and after that it was swollen and red and still itchy but less burning. The discomfort lasted for about 3 days then it started to fade. After all that pain and agony after about a week or so... the yeast infection was still there full fledge. Inconclusion, a completely useless and painful ""solution"" to a yeast infection."
1,What a load of crap....,"I bought this one time ovule, because I thought it would work and be over with, but I was sadly mistaken. It burns like crazy and the itching is worse than before I inserted the darn thing. The directions say you can use it either night or day, but sitting around with this goop coming out of you is no fun. I have always used it at night, but I thought I could get an early start on some relief. This is crazy! I feel like I've sprinkled hot sauce down in my underwear. It is unbearable! Stick to the five or seven day or even a three day would be better. I wonder if it'll work after all this. I'll let you know if I can."
1,STAY AWAY,"I have never written a review before but at 3:48am I am in so much pain that I have to join in and warn women about this product! I wish I had thought to look at reviews before purchasing it. I used to get yeast infections when I was younger and used the 7 day Monistat so I thought the products were just more sophisticated that they could offer a 1 day and I went for it. HOLY COW I AM IN PAIN!! I woke up to nurse my son and could barely sit still while he was nursing. I eventually had to put him down there is so much burning and itching (thankfully he was full at that point and fell asleep). Now I am up and can barely sit still I am so uncomfortable. I wish there was something I could do to make it go away! I am thrilled that there are other women that didn't have the reaction, but if I were you and you haven't been successful with this one before, do yourself a favor and at least get the 3 day one."
1,Will not use again! Would not recommend!!,"My doctor had diagnosed me with a yeast infection. Sooo...I decided to give it this stuff a shot. I have never written a review, but I was checking to see if others had experienced what I am experiencing, and to my horror they were. I can't say that I have experienced the itching, because...itching was terrible to begin with. However, I am on day 3 and I am still experiencing the burning. Honestly, feels like I am recovering from child birth. The inside of my vagina is red, and feels like I have scratches lining the inside. It also left a weird texture and their is severe pain with penetration. No happy hubby or wife for that matter. Please do not use this, if you are one of the lucky ones, great. But I wouldn't risk it.Oh yeah, I have never had a reaction to anything like this before. I'm 9 wks pregnant with my second child. If I could have rated this a ZERO I would have! They need to take this off the market!!!"
4,Don't let the reviews scare you...seriously,"I am a 20 year old sexually active female who is familiar with yeast infections (due to my own choices/antibiotics from avid uti's) and monistat ha never disappointed me. The burning comes from your vagina/uterus already being irritated. If you read any yahoo answers they will tell you to be aware that heavy irritation will occur if you're already irritated. This is a HIGH concentration of medicine so of course it packs a heavy punch. If you don't want to experience the symptoms (WHICH THE PACKET SAYS IRRITATION MAY INTENSIFY) then use the three day or like someone before said use the smaller dosage. If you want fast relief and can handle the pain, suck it up and use this. It sucks, but in my opinion it's worth it."
2,Omg! Help!!!,"Ok, I have a pretty high pain tolerance but this is insane! It itches and burns 100 times worse than my actual yeast infection. I'm here laying down suffering quietly so no one else in the house can here but this is sooo ridiculous! I read that box and those instructions like 12 times and not once did they mention suffering like this. I've used Monistat 1 before, but I've never experienced torture like this. Get the three day formula or even the seven day, just don't ever buy this product unless you enjoy unbearable pain and discomfort!! I'm not sure if it will work, but it better for pain like this..."
4,It works,I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews. It works. I used it once i was laying down and had no side effects and it has cleared all effects within 24 hours.
4,It's not scary!,"It works. I had no adverse reactions. So I am giving some recommendations to counter all of those one stars.First, READ THE DIRECTIONS. Second, ""One Day Treatment"" means that you put the Ovule in once. It does not mean that your yeast infection gets cured in one day. The box says that it can take up to 7 days for the treatment to work. Third, inserting the ovule at ""11 PM"" as some people who wrote bad reviews have done is not the same as putting it in all night. I inserted mine at 8:30PM and remained inactive for the rest of the evening. It will leak! Most of these products leak. Which is why you put it in at night and you don't move. By morning, there was no leaking for me.Finally, this is some powerful stuff. If you are sensitive to some medications do not use this. As always, ask your doctor and make sure you actually have a yeast infection.If you don't have a yeast infection, then you are probably only exacerbating whatever it is you actually have."
1,never again,Just imagine a wire brush you know where. Excruciating burning and itching. Stick to the 3 day to be on the safe side.
5,GODSEND!,"This is my second yeast infection, so at first I bought this 'syringe' thing with this liquid goop that had the consistency of neosporin. Worst thing ever!!! I was literally squeezing it out of my lady flower within 30 minutes of putting it in. Then my awesome mom got me Monistat One Ovule, and after shoving that up there I read the reviews and was horrified! So I sat in my bed, ibuprofen 500m in hand, waiting for the pain to start. I fell asleep waiting. Next morning I wake up feeling a lot better, with some minor leakage with is perfectly fine compared to what was going on down there before.Maybe this product isnt for everyone, but I had a really good experience and I'd be pissed if they took this off the market. :D"
2,"Alright, What this is what you want to do","The first 100 pages teach you basic stratagies and all that, but the rest is just 10 REAL SAT's, hence the name. If you want to improve your score then go to a prep class, get a book or cd-rom. Princton Review and Barrons are both good and get the job done. This book shows you what you score would be around if you took the test. Then you can decide if you want to take the test. The bottom line is: if you want to study for the test then don't get this but if you want to see where you are at the present time then buy it.P.S. The test are also outdated."
4,"""Slap her she's french"" - great movie","This was under going to be released under the ""Slap Her"" title.I saw the trailer and lost track of the movie but saw it on cable and this is sly funny movie, as good as Mean Girls.Piper plays a French exchange student who comes to stay with Starla, a Texan cheerleader beauty queen type. Texas as well as France are in for some parody but it is well done and not really mean spirited at all.The action as Piper works way into taking over Starla's life a la Single White Female (minus the CSI style violence) is a scream. The actress who plays Starla is great as well. The movie is comedy but also manages a unsappy message about self awareness while causing you too laugh your butt off.Melanie Mayron directed. Many of the funniest bits are visual, check Starla's kid brainy kid brother reading Tropic of Cancer."
4,Unusual,"This is a very unusual story, boardering on unbelievable. But then - - is everything suppose to be believable? Entertaining."
1,long and inexplicable,"I watched and I watched (and I watched) until the end, and when I got to there, the story wasn't any more clear to me than it had been in the beginning. Ralph Fienes plays a very pathetic character. Cate Blanchett is quite the opposite- confident and independent. I wish I could give you a summary of accounts, but it wouldn't make any more sense to you than it did to me. There's actually a narrator to the movie who speaks every once in awhile. The narrator is a descendent of Ralph Fienes's character. The movie starts out showing first Ralph and then Cate as children. Ralph's child-self is a redhead! It takes quite some time before their paths cross. Your attention may have been lost by then. I hope if you do watch this, you make out better than I did in fully understanding the plot."
4,Sherry,I was definitely skeptical when I first got this product. It did take some time to get use to it and my hair got tangled a few times. I have carpal tunnel and arthritis so it is very hard for me to blow out my hair and very time consuming. This product was great. I've gotten so good at it that my hair looks better done by me than my hairstylist.
1,Broken,"When i received the guitar all the strings were touching the 1st,2nd,3rd,and 4th frets...It was a birthday present and pissed me off that i had to return it and go buy something else for my son."
2,"Ok, but not great.","This book wasn't anything like the other bardic novels in this series. It had little or nothing to do with music or magic. I would have liked this story better if the ""bad guy"" hadn't been so pathetic. It seems as though Misty was getting desperate for an evil charactor in this book and just grabbed someone out of a hat. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the book, but the person who is behind the murders just didn't seem to fit the part. It is good, however, that we are able to understand and get to know Ardis better, but over all I felt disconnected from the under-developed charactors. A very light book; good if you have nothing else to read."
4,A bit of a Disappointment,"I anxiously opened Four and Twenty Blackbirds expecting to see more about the Free Bards and their tales, however they were never in sight, but only mentioned in passing. Usually when Merecedes introduces a new character in a series, it takes me awhile to warm up to them, then I start enjoying the story. However in this novel, I found it rather difficult to get into the story, which is unusual with her works, since I have reread the Valdemar Series (all of them to date!) AT LEAST 5 times over the course of the years. I doubt I would ever reread this paticular story again. If you are a fan of Mercedes Lackey, by all means read it, but just don't expect the action and pace of the Valdemar stories."
2,Disappointing!,"I was a little disappointed that this book is below Misty's standards. The plot is unimpressive, and the 'bad guy' is really just all too predictable and lack of character. However, the book can still be enjoyable especially if you have not read her other books which were much remarkable by comparison."
3,She's written better,"I am never sure if I am going to like Ms. Lackey's books. They seem to range from OK to excellent. Stranger at the Wedding was very good and I enjoyed it a lot, but this one was a waste of time. It never really did seem as though she really knew where she was going with it, and the characters never seemed to be ""fleshed out"". All in all, a disappointing book by someone who can do much better."
2,Disappointed,This product is so annoying. Changing the paper towel roll is too hard. With just the paper towel roll(empty)to get a grip on the thing to put on a new roll was nearly impossible. I had to grab the stand through the cardboard and my hand got all sticky from the glue and the top thingy is too hard to tell if it is on correctly.
2,Not what I thought I was geting,"Please know that this cuddle pal is very small. Also I received a duck, not a mouse, which is disappointing because I chose this product because it was a mouse. Like the other reviewer I wonder how much or how old the catnip is... Jackson is really uninterested. Total bummer.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is pretty damn cute if you are interested in a duck.."
3,connections and more connections!,This book is basically about spiritualism and its realm. It is a kind of crazy book that tells you stories that sometimes are unbelievable but that are interesting. The neat part of the book is when the author explain our spiritual connections with everything in the universe and the use of our heart for thinking and feeling.
3,It was ok,"It was an interesting read, but kind of hard to believe. I wish I was half as spiritual and/or gifted as the people mentioned in this book. That is the reason I purchased the book in the first place was to attempt to broaden my spirituality, but this book is not for the beginner. After reading this book I would guess I'm at about the pre K level of spirituality and this book is like the hand book for the quadruple PHD spiritual master. As far as the rest of the content it covers some very interesting topics although some what hard to believe. It seems like if the content in this book were truly real we would be living in a very different world. Instead of a Mcdonalds on every corner of every street it seems there would be a meditation building full of kids fighting over how to change the weather with their light bodies."
4,Living in the Heart,"After reading the Serpent of Light, this book is somewhat different.It is a good book to readDrumvaldo advocates to live in the sacred space of heart center.This is a sound concept which is also focussed on by many spiritual teachers as well, as the only true feelings come from our hearts.He explains what he sees from the heart, which I would term, ""with the inner eye!""He goes there in to the stillness of the heart in meditation, but seems to fail to explain to a lay person or reader how to get there earlier on.It may only be a minor oversight, but it is very important for the reader who does not know how to go into their hart.I find the inclusion of a meditation CD to add value to the book. There are many valuable illustrations included, which (if they were in color)would greatly anhance the contents.Overall, it is a good book to read and own in ones collection.Hans Liszikam, author of ""The God Goce in the Seven"""
4,Good Set...,"I liked this set. It's one of those sets and got me interested enough to watch it all the way thru. I wasn't ""hanging on to the edge of my chair but I did enjoy it and I suggest you watch it. Not to bad!"
2,Dogs Did Not Change,I used this years ago for my cock a poo and decided to give it a try for the two guys I now have. I hoped it would alleviate itching and shedding but did not accomplish either.
1,Not good enough to keep the canoe secure - Dangerous,"I bought these with a new Yakima setup to secure and haul my 75lb canoe around on top of the vehicle. The first two outings I began to wonder if I was cinching them all the way tight. After further use I decided the straps worked loose by driving at speeds less than 40MPH. From my percpective these are DANGEROUS to use for anything you want to secure onto your vehicle. They simple work loose far too easily. I believe the problem is with the material. The straps are durable but are comprised of slippery webbing that simply doesn't hold inside the buckle. If you want to make sure you boat is secure on your vehicle don't waste a second looking at these, instead I highly recommend the Yakima Ripcord Locking Strap which is reliable. Unfortunately these are what a lot of people will go to first and people will have dropped money on something which insecure and potentially dangerous."
2,Where did it go?,"I was fairly happy with this foundation except for 1 issue (and this is a big issue with me) - if you so much as touch anything or anyone with your face while wearing this foundation, it absolutely WILL transfer onto whatever your face has touched. Doesn't matter if you use primer or set it with a hydrating spray, it ALWAYS transfers. Always. I couldn't stand leaving my face on my boyfriend's shirts anymore (not to mention my cell phone, my work phone, my reading glasses, a tissue I used to blow my nose during allergy season, the collar on my coat, my winter hat, etc.) so I had to give it up. And when it transfers onto another surface, it transfers OFF your face leaving a spot without makeup. If you never hug anyone, never touch your own face and never wear clothes with collars that might reach your face, you'll love this stuff. Otherwise, look elsewhere for makeup."
1,Tushies are NOT GOOD,I love 7th Generation but do not care for Tushies. I found the tape fasteners on the sides either falls off from the diaper or does not stick. The cut of the diapers are very bulky and ill fitting. The diapers get soaked very quickly. NOt recommnended!
5,Excellent book on Color Mangement,Thia was requred book for a class I just took. Very pleased for once that a textbook that was required was actually useful and well written. I would highly recommend this book as a very effective tool with color managment of my workspace and photography.
3,Teen Mom Season 5,"An interesting perspective on teenage moms and the way 4 young women approach thier lives as very young mothers. While 3 of the 4 work extremely hard to build a better life for thier children the 4th seems to be an example of american kids today. It was hard to watch Jenelle continue to unravel this season, she remains an ungrateful spoiled brat who refuses to face her deamons, despite the very real risk of losing her son. The babies are now toddlers and are hilarious, adorable and often the highlight of the show."
5,Awesome gator!,I purchased this gator to help accent my son's nursery. I was pleasantly surprised how large it was for such a low price! It is very soft and huggable. Excellent purchase!
4,croc wrestling,I gave this to my 4 year old. He loves watching the croc shows and wrestling my pillows from the couch. Now he has his own croc to catch and my couch pillows stay on the couch.
2,Fine for older children,"My daughter was very interested in this style of lego, and after receiving it for Christmas, she played with it for a few days. It was somewhat difficult to find the little pieces depicted in the instructions and ensure that they aren't used in the incorrect spots, but the end result looked great. After building it (and a few variations), she tired of it and rarely plays with it again."
5,Percy does it again,"A spunky young Parisian named Josette must find a way to help her best friend, a young mother whose husband has been murdered by the CGS, get out of France. She barters for their passage to England with some incriminating letters that the CGS is desperate to get ahold of. But when the plan falls apart and Josette herself is facing the guillotine, The Scarlet Pimpernel must spirit her away from the jaws of death. This is a well-crafted tale of intrigue, murder and romance. Percy is in top form battling Chauvelin and his goons. Chauvelin is particularly bloodthirsty in this one!"
1,Not Functional Or Durable,Just read the other 1-star reviews. I won't bother retyping what they already say.
3,Good deal,"There is a newer addition to this book out, but this edition is a good deal. This book is very detailed and rather difficult to understand at times, but does make for a good reference."
5,Great book.,The book explains in good detail about computer forensics and investigations. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to look into this field of study.
3,suggest you buy replacement tubes right away,"We bought this to keep crickets for my daughter's bearded dragon. It works GREAT, and is easy to clean. The black tubes are wonderful for ease of dispensing crickets.However, the clear plastic caps are a serious weakness. They break way too easily. We're down to one tube being useable. Fortunately there are replacement tubes available (though not at the local stores, we have to order them). My suggestion is that you purchase a replacement set when you purchase your kricket keeper, so you'll have them on hand. You're going to need them.If not for this pretty serious design flaw, I'd have given this a five star review."
2,"Not up to ""The Deed""","I thoroughly enjoyed The Deed of Paksenarion, but I cannot recommend Liar's Oath. The story's weak and Laup is an unlikable, uninspiring character that reminds me of a government bureaucrat who's not happy in his job but doesn't have the courage to do anything else. Gird's character, isn't around long and I never really had a sense for the purpose of the book. It isn't good enough to stand on it's own merits and I didn't find it a particularly good precursor. The book ends with a resounding fizzle and even Paks and Duke/King Keri can't save it. I haven't given up on Ms. Moon though. Her extraordinary narrative added so much to the wonderful story line in The Deed. Unfortunately in Liar's Oath it's not enough to save the weak story"
2,2 for under 3 for grad.,"there are few problems in this book. This book may be good for a graduate level students. but it is far advanced for an introductory course. First, author did not explain very sign in an equation. it seems author expects readers to know each sign automatically. I feel like I need to go over the book in order to find what the sign means. second, in the text, author mentioned about wave function. and he gives a brief explaination about it. In my opinion, a brief introduction is not enough. he should also include a complete reference in the book talking about wave function. Thrid, and the worst, author did not give a clear explaination for example. It is not step by step. Reader needs to be very intelligent to apply and understand the approach in example. In later part of problems, he gives a question that he did not really mention about it. I always feel the best book is a book that is most clear and comprehensible. This book is not."
1,"garbage, awful book","This is not basic principles. Half of the book is math, very complicated endless pages and pages of math, and the problems bear no passing relation to the concepts being explained. The book has many graps, none of which is ever explained in the text. Most graphs do not have the axis labeled so you have no clue what the graphs mean. Didn't we learn to label our graphs in say second grade? There is very little explination of principles, and the explination is very poor. Author obsessed with history lessons and verbose statements about ""Semiconductors have revolutionized the world, bla bla bla."" If you are looking for explanations, look elsewhere, you will find none in this miserable excuse for a text. Awful!!!"
3,good for most dogs,My dog likes to see what she can chew off of a toy. She managed to chew parts off of this :(
4,great toy,"My dog has really strong teeth and loves to chew on rubbery toys. He destroys most of them, but the Kong toys are the only ones that can withstand his chewing... and this one is particularly great to throw around because it has a funny bounce that he loves. I just wish Kong made more toys because they are now the only ones we buy!"
5,Willcock's finest hour,"This is not what you would call an ""authentic"" version in the choice of instruments this great master users. However I firmly believe that if you want to try and catch the spirit of this great work Willcocks is hard to beat and very authentic indeed. This is a warm performance full of life. The evangelist is sung perfectly by Robert Tear, and Shirley-Quirk sings the part of our Lord with great energy and does a great job of bringing the text life. The Bach Chior well they are truely moving here. The Thames Chamber orchestra gives a rich warm flowing sound. Singing it in English was a great move making it easy to follow if you don't speak German. The notes given about this version in gives good insight into Willcock's thinking. Pitty King's College Cambrigde Choir weren't in this but anyway this is a superb recording. Bach would like it, and I'm sure Christ enjoys it too. Willcock you did a fine job here."
4,"Slick, Dramatic","I bought this on a lark when I saw the Amazon had it in their recommended slot. Yamamotos' slick artwork and great characterization drew me in. The stories are paced well and it was a pleasant read. Voyeur is culled from ""adult"" manga in Japan, so there's just the right amount of sleaze mixed in with the action. It's not gratuitous nudity and sexual content like the XXX comics that we have here. A refreshing change from the usual stuff that we see in manga. A plausible fun read with sympathetic, realistic characters. Now, where did I put my night vision goggles? followed by a sequel in Japan. ""Voyuers Inc."" is about two different characters and is by a different artist."
3,I usually love it,"Not their best work but I had to have it to complete my collection of all Camel albums, Not bad but not great"
5,Shiny,I got these for me and my partner and we're very happy with them. My partner has received comments with how shiny and pretty it is. The only drawback is the black lettering on the inside comes off but maybe it's meant to. It still looks really nice without the black lettering. I received them really fast too.
5,Hard to find book,Purchased for my mother and I know she will be very surprised and pleased to have this book. Good price.
1,"I would give it a ""Rapid Zero"" if I could","This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Besides the cheezy midi soundtrack, the acting was terrible, and the storyline was worse. Whoever shelled out the money to make this movie is probably in the poor-house. What a poor bloke."
2,Handle with care,"As far as a pocket pc its a good buy. The thing is, never take it on the road, because its extremely delicate. I work in a semi-corporate environment (im a multimedia producer), so the item was never in a rough o dangerous environment. The item was 2 months old, and in mint condition, but the lcd screen one day burst. After waiting 3 months for an answer, the final reply basically was: (the customer service person was very nice and friendly and totally simpathetic) these are very delicate items, we regret what happened to you, but we invite you to purchase another. So basically the item in their eyes is a disposable $250 toy."
3,Good product,"As a general matter, the pocket pc is a great device and its a lot of fun to use and the Viewsonic machine works fine, though I agree with the previous comments about the misleading memory claims. Viewsonic has revised the way that they advertise the machine, though they claim that the original advertising was not false or misleadingIt provides a seemless compliment to my desktop PC and an alternative to lugging home my laptop from work every night."
3,Good CD........with a few faults,"All in all, this is a pretty decent CD although it has its faults. Being a high school clarinet player and having played all the songs except for the Hammersmith, I recommend this CD. Personally, I found the first two movements of Holst's 1st suite and the 3rd movements of Holst's 2nd suite to be too slow. I also found the oboe solos in both the English Folk Song Suite and in the 2nd Suite in F to be very low and almost drowned out. Otherwise, I enjoy this CD."
2,"Teases, but offers very little detail","Aside from the installation sections, this is only a fair book. It isn't terrible, it gives snippets of information about many topics.Unfortunately, this is all this book gives you. It offers very little detail on almost everything the book covers, leaving you in the dark at almost every section.For example, the book describes that to disable a users account, the admin should create a tail script to do so. It then offers a few lines of text showing a tail script, and then tells you to modify the passwd file.That's great, but what EXACTLY needs to be modified? Do I stick the tail script at the end of the user's entry? Do I have to snip out some text somewhere?If you want some general instruction about the what Linux is capable of, this is a decent book. In terms of Linux implementation and administration however, it needs a lot of work."
2,Slapped together,"The authors of this book cover a lot of ground, but they just weren't that thorough -- this book bears the classic marks of a tome slapped together so a publisher would have an offering on a hot topic. For example, the installation guide on the Red Hat web site gives much better information than the book. A major complaint -- they often give command lines without explaining what they are doing -- even if you are able to follow the authors' instructions you have to do so blindly."
2,Totally frustrating experience.,"Authors can explain something well if they know well. These two authors throughout the book, in large part, tell you to do post-configuration stuff. They have clearly avoided most of the criticial configuration details on how to set up dialup networking, Internet SLIP/PPP connection, browser setup, client network configuration. Small but useful details like using FDISK for partition or setting up a modem are deliberately avoided. I have reasons to belive that these authors have no real experience on installing and configuring any Linux OS. It is a fruit of cook-book cutting-pasting job."
3,Not a real medical thriller,"In the midst of an malpractice lawsuit, the Center for Fertility and Enhancement, Dr. Tim Sullivan is in a car accident. Business partner Dr. Ben McKay, also an ordained minister, comes to the house to console Marnie Sullivan. Soon, the two of them begin a relationship. Later a bomb destroys the lab and almost kills one of the partners, Dr. Luc Morgan. Slowly, Marnie and Ben piece together what Tim was working on and they realize that everyone connected to the clinic is in danger."
1,Junk,You can not set the time or the chip values that you want. You are also limited on the length of the tournament you choose. Awful..
3,"Nice, but hard to understand in places","I got the book from the library, and overall I like the ideas in it. But because the book is a transcript from his taped sessions, it is not always easy to get what he is saying without actually seeing the faces and what's going on in the studio.And there are so many typos in the book.I am going to try one of his ""real"" books."
3,Steady survey of Chinese History,"If you are looking for a neutral but good look in Chinese history this book might be good for you.The Emperial Age is still seen as the most important age since the byline of the book is before, during, and after the Empire. Since this is by far the longest period it does make sense.Cotterel starts in the prehistoric age and describes all the dynasties in a chronological order. Things change of course during the beginning of the 20th century with the Republic and later the communist party with Mao. The book ends in the late 1980's and it does describe, though limited, the events at Tianmen Square and the fall of the president and the coming of Jian Zeming.It's a very readable book and if you have no knowlegde about Chinese history this book is good to start with."
4,great audio version of this piece,"I had the Doyle Carte version on vinyl, which was fun, but not really well done and was longing to find it when the CD craze hit. Only to find that it was not available. I ""ended up"" with this version. And I am not disappointed. This version is about as complete to the original intention as you can get, unless you are lucky enough to find the video installment from the PBS series in the late eighties.the recording is done as if it was a professional company going through a last minute rehearsal. It is not a polished, modern professional piece by any means. But it is well done and a delight to listen to. It does not have a complete professional score to the music. but the voices do very well. Think of this as a ""parlour piece"" done by some very talented friends."
4,Good listening,"I bought this album two or two and a half year ago, and I can say that you can still enjoy listening to it now. Good progression and some original tracks. You will hear Urban Dwellers songs in some Chill Out compilations."
5,Magnifico,"This is one of the finest violin recordings of all time. Passion and expressiveness shine in the fullest sense throughout; but it's never over the top. Every track is super. Caprice Viennios, however, sets the ultimate benchmark (I wonder if that could partly be because it's the namesake of the composer's original home city). Bravo, magnifico!"
4,atlas of the lunar terminator,the atlas is the best publication that i have seen that shows details of the moon. only nasa could publish something beter. photos are shown when the shadows and lighting are the best for each area of the moon. composite photos are used to show excellent detail.
5,Syd Field is awesome!,"I love this book by Syd Field. Not only is it a great read, but it helped me to complete two screenplays. Thank you Syd!!!"
2,Generic,"If there was ever a book that tried to teach you a formula for screenwriting, this is it. I've never understood the fascination with Syd Field by screenwriters. Some say this is the bible for screenwriters, but it really doesn't tell you much of anything. If you really want to learn about the art of scriptwriting, read Robert McKee's ""Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting"". That will give you the deeper understanding of screenwriting you'll be lacking after Syd Field."
4,This is what to expect: to learn how to form a script,"Very good book to learn the rules and structure of a screenplay. I believe this book really helps to breakdown the screenplay so that it's not as difficult to write. The only thing with this book I would like to have been different is some of the movies. Some of the movies he chose to talk about I have not seen before. When I rented them to understand what he was talking about I didn't really like any of the movies he picked. I guess it's just a different generation.If you are looking at this book to buy this is what you should expect: you will learn the three act structure and how to break it down to focus on the important aspects of writing. Watch a lot of movies (that you like) and study them with the book, it helps. If you are a beginner, this book is a great place to start. He does get a little redundant at times, but it's still a good book."
5,The Leading Screenwriting Guide,"No wonder Screenplay is considered the leading screenwriting guide and Syd Field the meta guru of screenwriting! As an intermediate screenwriting student and accomplished actress, I read all the other books on screenwriting available and never really found what I was truly looking for until I began to study Syd's books. I recommend them highly to anyone, beginner or advanced alike, who is interested in becoming a screenwriter or just furthering his craft. The new, revised edition is even better than the original, if possible. Syd really shows you how you can adapt his wealth of knowledge to your own script and make it all it can be. Thanks, Syd!"
2,"2 1/2 Stars really, but they won't let me put that....","You see, the thing is, this book is a terribly mixed bag in terms of usefullness (I hope I spelled that right). By that, I mean that most parts of it--particularly the storytelling and structuring sections--are basically useless to the independent screenwriter (such as myself). To someone ballsy enough to think they can break in via Hollywood, this book is probably a Godsend. It illustrates perfectly what Hollywood looks for in a screenplay. However, most indie writers don't really care what Hollywood wants--in fact, that's why alot of independent writers go independent--so they should pass on it. I WILL concede, however, that the passages on character building are reasonably sound, even though some of the excercises Mr. Field talks about are rather pointless (trust me, I did 'em). So for Hollywood screenwriters, I give it a '5' or an 'A'. But for independent screenwriters, I must give it a '0', or an 'F'."
1,Unforgettably Awful,"It is not often that one is driven to write a negative review, two years after having read it.After Dunkirk inspires one to such an act. To be honest, all that I remember about this book is having to battle through unreadable prose and trying to detect a story line. It could well be that Madame Mcgraw who is Czech is a brilliant writer in her native language. However, even the pliable English language cannot endure such punishment.I was further shocked to discover that this work was result of a writers grant. I can think of far better uses for valuable artistic resources.Finally the news got even worse. At the time of reading,Madame McGraw was busily inflicting yet another one of her books on the suffering literary public."
2,catwoman accessory kit,"Ordered this, although not from Amazon, from another company. I was disappointed in what I got. The picture made it look like the actual mask worn in the 2005 movie, which is what I was after. But alas it is only a mask with a rubber band strap to go behind the head, it doesn't cover the whole top of the head like I expected and the eye holes are small. The gloves are just handless slip ons and the nails you get are glue on but come with some kind of stick on stuff. You can probably do better buying the fake nails in a department store. I guess it just goes to show if you want the real thing, you may just have to learn to sew and make your own."
4,I have read Wilson before,"As an introduction to his thought,this is enough to tell if it's your cup of tea or not.For those already familiar,any given chapter makes for a good re-acquaintance."
4,Works Ok For Me,"I would have rated 3 and a half stars if I could. I have not had an issue with any denting or anything falling off. I have used this for over a year now. The only criticism I agree with is that there are some bigger chunks of cheese at the end of grating that fall through. Really that is not a huge deal. I have picked one or two chunks off my pasta and the world did not come to an end. It works fine for me. I am sure there are better made out there and I bought mine at TJMAXX so I think I only spent 7 or 8 bucks. I wouldn't spend 23 but I am like that about everything. If I don't find it for a good bargain price I'll forgo it. If you are a perfectionist look elsewhere for one, if you just want some cheese on your pasta this does the trick."
2,Bad Choice,"My previous grater was a plastic Zyliss. It lasted for many years and worked well, but I bought the Cuisipro grater thinking that an all metal unit would outlast and outperform the plastic Zyliss. Wrong! The Cuisipro leaves chunks of ungrated cheese, the handles are loose and flop about, and the drum bent quickly under normal use. The Cuispro grater is poor quality and poor design. I went back and replaced it with the vastly cheaper but better Zyliss. Lesson learned."
1,Cuisipro Rotary Cheese Grater,"This tool is very poorly made. When grating cheese the handle tended to twist in the hand making it difficult to control and causing discomfort.With medium pressure during use, caused the drum to dent!Returned Cuisipro grater.Strongly dissatisified! Looks good, but a piece of junk."
4,GREEK HOMOSEXUALITY,"The book is well researched and that is not my problem, what I do however do not like is when one buys from a seller from Amazon (even if the book is used) it should still have all its pages. I am missing quite a few plates and will need to purchase another copy if I am to complete my study of the topic. Annoyed."
5,This is what perfect sounds like!,"Koda Kumi has done it again! The girl who brought you ""Real Emotion"" and ""Nasty Girl"" has released ""Secret"" and the intro gets you dancing when you first press the play button. Even if you don't know japaneese language, you will be dancing anyway. Every song on this album is great, ecspecially ""Cutie Honey"", ""Selfish"", ""Hearty"", ""Trust You"" ""Love Holic"", ""Let's Party"", and ""Believe"". This is what perfect is all about."
5,Excellent Value in a Digital Camera Bag,"This inexpensive camera bag from Case Logic has proved to be invaluable. It has padding, structure, color that makes it easy to locate and it is the perfect fit for my Sony Cyber-Shot. It zips shut and has a neat little exterior velcro compartment to store a memory stick or extra batteries. I have dropped my camera while it was in this bag and it was unharmed. I love this bag!"
3,A few basic ideas that could revealed in 20 pages,"I think this is a good book if you need to know what your passions are, and how to prioritize them. But that's really all this book is about. The same ideas are gone over again and again. The basic ideas are good, but what I don't particularly like is that the authors have turned this into a gimicky business, with gimicky e-mails and even ""Passion Test counselors"". In fact, the only reason I bought this book was because I was accosted by a passion test counselor. lol.A better book, I think, about the same subject matter, is ""Creating the Work You Love,"" by Rick Jarrow. There are meditation exercises that actually create transformation, so that one naturally falls in line with their true passion, or the work that inspires them."
5,The Passion Test,This is a great book..One that helps you on your path to achieving what you want in life...you just need to be clear & focus on your passions..Just great!! If you are on a journey to discover what you want most in life.
5,Well Worth the Effort,"The Passion Test requires a lot of commitment from the reader, but it's well worth the effort. The guidance and exercises in this book really match up the desires of the heart with plans for the future."
3,Good book. It will get you to begin thinking.,I have just begun reading the book. It is interesting and gets you to really think about what you want most from life.
1,The Passion Test,I found the book disappointing and overly reliant on philosophies in conflict with my religious beliefs. The occasional interesting point didn't make up for the overall esoteric bent. I threw it away without finishing it.
5,Not just another self help book,Taking the passion test was really an illuminating and powerful experience. Going through the exercise had me really get how deeply my comittment to make a difference in the area of parenting went. I stopped using being too busy as an excuse and reconnected with how important living one's passion is. I am one week away from completing a life long dream of writing a parenting book. I have done two teleclasses on parenting (after being convinced it could be done on the phone) and I owe it to reading and doing the Passion Test. Thank you Janet and Chris - I'm already giving it as gifts.Shelly Lefkoe - President - Lefkoe Insitute
2,A VERY LIGHT READ,"While this book is an interesting read, it doesn't have a lot of depth. I must agree with several of the comments already written, the 'meat' of the book could have been covered concisely in a brief web site or worksheet. In completing the book, the reader is left hanging a bit as far as how to begin to take action. I have found other books to be more helpful in putting passions into your daily life to achieve full abundance."
4,"NOT GREAT, BUT VERY GOOD AND HELPFUL","This book reminds me of The Secret, but using the Passion Test helps you define exactly how to attract the things that you want in life and what they are. The book helps you define the things that you want if you don't already know. By comparison to the book, Passion Plan, I believe this is a far better book to help you find your direction and passions. The actual test in the book is very useful. I believe this is a nice companion book to one of my favorite books, so far, by Barbara Scher, ""I Could Do Anything, If Only I Knew What It Was"".I would not recommend The Passion Plan. Lots of words, but not that useful. I really have a complaint about authors that write to impress their peers rather than really, in as few words possible, give you lots of good information without wasting a lot of words. If I want to buy a Dictionary, I will buy one here on Amazon. This book gets to the point and is a easy read."
3,"Sound quality was good, but the ear buds slip frequently",I was using this headset for last one month.Pros:1. Sound quality was good.2. Mike was clear while on call.Cons:1. Ear buds slip frequently and don't sit properly in ears.2. Only one set of ear foams.
1,Don't buy anything from this company - horrible service,"Placed an order for this item 11 days ago. Item was ""in stock and available to ship"". But item has not been shipped and Customer Service does not respond to my email and voice mail requests for status update. I finally was able to talk with Customer Service today and they admitted they don't have the item in stock and the item is no longer made."
1,Load of Feces!,"All I can say is BEWARE....this movie was a total waste of time. It was boring, boring, boring....switching back and forth from John Allen Mohammed (Ken Foree) babbling boringly about basically nothing that makes sense and quick snippets of him and Malvo's interactions....basically and hour and half of him lecturing Malvo on his philosophy. God this movie was terrible.....and after I watched it I find out that Ulli Lommel is the one who made this crap....figures.....every true horror/crime story this idiot has made has been nothing but boring AND innaccurate garbage. If I had known this dork made this from the beginning I wouldn't have bought it!"
2,"Great photos, but very poorly written and edited.","Any 314 or Pan Am fanatic will undoubtedly enjoy this book for its terrific photo coverage of the aircraft. But the writing is so poor that it is hard to discern what the author is trying to say most of the time, and the editing was non-existant. It is sheer torture trying to sit down and read the text, which is a shame because the author unquestionably was in possession of a significant amount of good research material. And typical of most Schiffer books, there was not even an attempt at editing the manuscript for typos, misplaced punctuation, or other errors."
3,Average,"For a professional group, this one lacks the last degree of accuracy in intonation and articulation. The arrangements are pretty coy and not particularly inventive, but then the entire album is of the Nuclear Whales (see also) genre of fluff. I would not recommend this and certainly would not use it for students to emulate.Pro: Flight of the Bumble Bee has some impressive technique."
3,"Good plot, but not enough submarine action.","The main plot of the book is alright. It has much action and is a very original concept. The only problem I might have had with it is that a good portion of the book is devoted to land battle, more than is written about Submarine Warfare."
2,OLD SOFTWARE 100 TIMES BETTER!,"In about 2000, I made a series of beautiful CD labels using the Memorex CD Label program--Then, when my computer imploded, lost that program and had no way to even open the labels until I bought the current software.AND IT IS TERRIBLE-- Where previously the software was use-friendly, quick and allowed a lot of artistry, now it is a slow, primitive version of its former self.I just wonder--Why would Memorex shoot their own software in the foot like this? Are they just planning to phase it out entirely, but making it too difficult and time-consuming to even use?"
4,"Lots of details, not lots of entries","What I love about this reference is that each entry has a lot of detail showing you how to use each word in context. What I don't like so much is that there just aren't as many entries as I wish there were, but nonetheless it's worth having."
4,Lots of fun for boys and girls!,"My 2 year old son got this toy for his birthday and he loves it! Contrary to some of the other feedback listed for this toy, this toy is not scary, gross or disgusting at all. I actually find the sayings cute: 'Let's give this lawn a buzz-cut', 'Power up', 'This grass is thick/tall', Let's give this lawn a fancy cut', 'Power down', and 'The grass is perfect'. This lawn mower does not burp as one of the other feedback comments suggested. My son uses the lawn mower in the house as well as outside. What's great is it even has a switch underneath the lawnmower where you can turn the sound on or off. My little girl just started walking and she even loves to play with it. The only problem is that she and her brother like to fight over who gets to play with it first :)"
2,This toys needs a manners lesson!,"The durability is fine, it moves on grass well and the mowing sound is cute...BUT the faces can be a little scary for younger or more timid children. The MOST IMPORTANT part...the phrases this mower has and the fact that it burps...it is just rude and unecessary! These are things I want to teach my children not to do. We returned it and purchased the Little Tykes mower for now and we are considering a John Deer."
3,A lot of fun - but terribly noisey,"I purchased this toy for my 1 year old after watching how much fun she had with push toys in the store. It turned out to be perfect for her. She has a blast pushing it all over the house. That being said, it did not turn out to be perfect for her mother; the mower is incredibly loud - even when it is turned off. Just the chunk-chunk sound of the big head moving back and forth is enough to drive a parent insane."
2,"Fun, but ...","This IS a fun, cute book, but it really bothers me that Russell tries to sleep in the trunk of an old car. This is not a good example to be setting for kids - every once in a while a child tries this and gets stuck, sometimes dying before being found."
5,My review for dsa,I think dsa is a funny and exciting series . I recomend it for anyone who likes that type of book.
1,Mac owners.... Run,"It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support, and cannot be made to support Mac files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named ""ilegally"" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt ""OK""?. ""OK"" is your only choice to click on. By clicking on ""OK"" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder. How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled. The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak. Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac. Run Mac owners... Run"
1,Died and cost a fortune to recover,My HD died before 5 years and it cost a fortune to recover NAS data. Beware and don't rely on it as your only backup. Recovering data from a NAS device costs significantly more than a regular USB HDD.
3,Good but not what I was hoping for,"I bought the Net Center on the understanding that it was capable of Raid 1. After receiving it I discovered it was not and as I am very serious about backup I invested in a synchronizing program to mirror the Net Center onto the USB drive plugged into the Net Center, which means I have to have a computer on at all times to run the synchronization.Apparently the Net Center is capable of Raid 1 but it was not enabled. It would be a great deal if it was.Other than the RAID issue I do like it. I keep my iTunes library on it so I can access it from any computer in the house. I also keep my iPhoto library on it too. I rip my DVD's to it and play them on my iBook wirelessly and it works fine. It is a little slow to copy files to it but I have adapted to that. I like having a NAS, it has given me a lot more flexibility.Overall I recommend this product for the price."
2,Interesting product,"The NetCenter is an interesting concept. A file server within a External HD case.Pros: Very convenient to have a network based file repository.Cons: Very slow access. No too Macintosh friendly (the installation tool doesn't work well. Thanks to the OSX Unix, this can easily be solved.Conclusion: good product concept, but too slow as a file server..."
4,Great Product,Easy installation! The 2 USB ports came in handy to support a network printer and another drive for backup. I removed a star because I was disappointed with the included Backup software. I use Sync Toy so it really didn't matter. I'd definately buy another.
5,AWSOME!,"The remixes to When The Money's Gone, and Love One Another are awsome! When the money's gone remixes darkened the song up and made it more house sounding, Great for clubs, and parties. I recommend it for anyone who like Cher and/or dancing!!"
3,Okay,I wouldn't wbuy this unless you're'a die hard bruce less fan. buy the warrior within by john little. it covers far more of bruce's philiosophies then this book.
2,The really own words of the master are excellent,"One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee. The rest consists of interviews with the former interviewers. However, as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune. But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already mentioned at the beginning."
4,A must-get for college seniors!,"This book is great for the snior looking at colleges. Barrons only list what the school offers for size, location, and curriculum. Birnbach's book gives an in-depth view of the college, examining everything from popular classes and professors to favorite local hang-outs. It allows you to take a small walk around campus before even leaving town. I think it is a great aid for anyone seriously looking to attend college."
5,A Terryfying Road Trip On A Lonely Country Road!!!,"This movie is about three young men who are driving on a lonely dark country road. On their way they pick up a Policeman played by Randy Quaid who is happy to get a ride and since he is ""offf duty"" he ignores the fact that these young men have been drinking. Their car is then persued by a mysterious 1950's Black Cadillac and they bravely try to outrun the car. This movie is full of unexpected twists and turns and is enhanced by Randy Quaid's performance who I believe is one of the greatest character actors working in Hollywood today. This movie will make you feel as if you are riding in the car with these guys and that was just on my TV screen!!! This movie would have been absolutely rivetting and scary if viewed in a Movie Theatre!!!Do yourself a big favour and watch this movie!!!"
5,beautiful pics,i am an official fairy art addict and this little book has soooooo many pics for me to admire. they are beautiful illustrations by a variety of talented artist. any fairy art addict will love this. even my 4 year old son loves looking at the pics.
5,Better then I remembered!!!,"I loved this cartoon when it orginally aired back in the 80s. Growing up in the 1980s and early 90s there were so many great (action oriented) animated shows for children. The Adventures of The Galaxy Rangers ranks in my top ten. I am half way through watching the Vol. 1 and the show is better than I remembered. The writting on this show was more mature than many of the shows that were running at the time. Rangers has a nice space western feel with a nice combination of drama, comedy, and horror. The characters are well developed and very memorable. The early use of CGI animation was far ahead of its time. I bought both Volumes of this collection and I can't wait to watch every episode. This is a collection that will not disappoint. ""No Guts, No Glory"""
4,"Good, but not great. Read to know why...","Well I though this would be the dvd to rule them all, but it wasn't quite that way. The extras are great, but the problem is that the image quality is BAD. The master was obviously a U-matic or a analog composite Betacam, since composite color artifacts can be seen all the time, creating jaggies in the image. I was hoping the series would get a treatment like transformers did, with a completely new master from new telecine of the original film reels. C'mon guys, just repacking in a nice box and putting the damn episodes in order ( the previous dvd's of the series were ramdomly distributed though several dvd in a completely retarded order ) doesn't make it more special...C'mon Coch, you can do better..."
2,Recycled nonsense,"Pretty much like every other Vince Vaugh filler. Ben Stiller, in my opinion, has stepped down a notch. Maybe good for 12-13 year olds or 18 to 20 year olds that still like to live in fantasy. The premise I think is good but nothing original was done, just a lot of confrontations you've seen before."
1,Not very good,"Wasn't very good, Ben Stiller ruins everything he touches theses days. I think your time would be better wasted watching something different"
3,Fair enough,"An okay choice for a couple good laughs. Definitely a rental though, I wouldn't waste my money buying it on DVD."
3,Could of been better,"Heres the deal with this movie the comedy was ok and the acting at times was a little over the top and ridicous. This is where the movie gets its strength, it had pretty good action. I also thought it was great when they blew stuff with that alien weapon. The funniest part of the movie was when evan and bob treated franklin like a dog by call him to come with them lol. I was on the floor laughing at that one. Overall, it wasnt a bad movie it just needed more work on the comedy"
3,It was different,"I love all the actors in this film so we were excited to rent it when it was made available. There are some funny moments in the video, but all and all it was just a little weird. We watched it all the way through, but I am not sure that was a good idea. The movie was just random and unexpected. Weird plot and twists. With these 4 funny actors, I just expected so much more."
3,funny BUT,was funny- the foul language was pretty constant. definately not to have on if children are in & out of the room
2,watch out!,"a little slow moving, some funny parts, but overall I would pass. Great cast, but I expected a lot more."
3,a good watch,This is a very entertaining if not typical Ben Stiller and Vince Vaugh movie. Funny with an ironic plot line.
2,Do not waste your time,"Do not rent. With these actors I didn't expect a lot but this was bad. Not a good movie, nothing but Junior High School humor."
3,a good waste of time,"There wasn't much about this movie that was truly memorable or laugh out loud, but it was funny and well produced. We enjoyed it."
2,$1 Rental,"If you can rent this for a buck, go for it. Some funny lines/parts, but movie was mostly flat. Definitely not for watching with the kids like you can with some movies with this rating. Some pretty obscene stuff - which I don't mind (ie, there's an orgy scene) - just have to screen some of the R rated movies prior to letting your teens watch them too (common sense). Overall, disappointed with the movie. Didn't live up to expectations."
3,Funny and silly,"Some very funny parts, especially Vince Vaughn. But also stupid in a lot of ways. Good movie if you just want to waste time and laugh it up."
1,Why so much profanity,I loved the plot. I loved the actors. I hated the fact that every scene contained huge numbers of profane words. I never realized that anyone actually talks like this. Had to turn the movie off after 10 minutes. I wished the previews disclosed the amount of profanity being used.
4,pretty good!,its pretty funny! i wish there was more fight scenes. i wish there was more fight scenes. i wish there was more fight scenes.
2,Stupid movie,"I usually like Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn movies. I think they are funny even if the movie is a bit funny stupid. But this movie was just plain stupid and nothing funny about it at all. I was very disappointed, it looked like it was going to be a really good funny movie. Would not recommend to a friend or anyone else. It was such a waste of time to watch."
3,My review,"Watched this as a time filler on a Saturday afternoonThe special effects on the aliens were good, and there were a few laughsI would recommend if there is nothing else to watch, then watch the watch"
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! THIS MOVIE WAS WORTHLESS AND I TURNED IT OFF AFTER 20 MINUTES. I HATED IT
2,Not Funny,A disappointment. Not the best movie from Ben Stiller. Very low life comedy. Don't ever pay to see this movie.
2,"Sadly disappointing, despite low expectations","I purchased this mostly because Richard Ayoade (IT Crowd) is in it and all I wanted was some thing funny playing the background while I did some work.Turns out, there were 3 good laughs through the whole movie and most of them were really cheap.In more detail what was sad about the movie:-Vince Vaughn's creepy obsession with his daughter's sex life.-Play on stereotypes is offensive nowhere near funny.-Too many penis jokes to count... not creative either-The plot is unfortunate and not in a remotely interesting way.-There are others, but going into further detail would be a play by play of the movie.Watch at your own risk"
1,Pretty bad,"I love Ben Stiller, especially his earlier comedies (e.g. Duplex, Envy, Along Came Polly, etc.) but this movie is really bad. Unimaginative, cliche script, unintelligent dialog, weak + contrived plot, lots of foul language and worst of all ... very little that was funny. Back off from this one. Way off!"
1,Pay no Play!!,I give this movie a one star. It wouldn't play on the media player on the site. Not very Happy!
2,The previews were the best part.,"The movie was ... bad, and any other adjectives akin to bad that you can come up with. The streaming via Amazon video was top notch however, no glitches ... worked perfectly."
3,The Watch,I could have waited on renting this as I didn't realize it was an alien movie but it still was somewhat funny
3,Don't Bother,"Save your money. Look for something better. Life is too short. Buy a burger instead, it will be more satisfying."
3,Borderline,"This movie had a few funny moments but not throughout the whole movie. I could not tell if it was a scary movie, a comedy or action. It was a little confusing."
3,Watchable,"The watch was pretty good. It was a bit more raunchy than I was expecting and some of the humor wasnt really my taste, but overall it was a good watch. I found myself laughing throughout the movie. It has a pretty simple story line but stays in line with Ben Stiller type humor and adds a bit of scifi. Kinda cool. If you like Ben Stiller, you will probably like this."
2,If there is nothing else to watch,Its Like a long saturday night live skit. Has a couple of funny scenes. The guys in this movie are funny but this movie was slapped together to make a quick buck.
3,so so,the trailer of course showed all the best parts - semi funny - mostly silly - not a good story line and a B at the best.
3,Okay,This could have been so much funnier. The aliens were nicely done and there were a couple of laugh out loud moments but for the most part it was just ok.
1,So bad I am actualy stunned,"Nothing funny in this movie at all, this is so bad. I love all the actors in it ( in other movies!) and actually feel embarassed and sorry for them for the bad script. They must have suffered doing this ... It is a wild nonsense orgy of aliens, lame jokes, chlichees, and - in case everything else hasn't caused enough damage - really awful sex jokes. It actually made me cringe with embarrassement. Like watching someone you like trying to tell a joke and desperately fail, so you want to just tell them to stop but you can't ..."
2,The Watch (HD),"It was a bad script, so they threw in too much profanity. Usually like Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, but this movie was a real bomb. The plot was very predictable and the acting was bad. I wouldn't recommend the movie to any of my friends."
1,Stupid,I thought it would be funny. It really was lame. I am glad I only rented it. I would not buy this movie.
1,Seriously??,It's really a shame because those guys are really funny. It was so nasty visually and through the non stop references. It could have been a really good movie without all that junk in it.
2,The Watch,Old men acting like Middle School children. Ben and Vaughn are past their prime and were mediocre when they were in it.
2,The Watch,"The movie was full of violence, very crude adult scenes, language and nudity. It was very disappointing. I would not recommend this movie."
3,It was ok,Got some laughs out of me but the story line was terrible. Rent it if there is noting else good out.
1,WASTE OF $$$!!!,"I didn't even get to watch the end of this movie. i watched the previews for this.... it looked funny. During the first few minutes I asked, ""Is this the UNCUT VERSION?"" A few minutes later, ""Are you SURE this isn't the UNCUT version?"" Then the ORGY scene came on!!! I scream, ""ENOUGH! TURN IT OFF!!! TURN IT OFF!!! I'M DONE!""DON'T be fooled by the previews!!! As I said, I did not watch this movie to the END! No matter how much you think that Stiller+Vaughn = FUNNY... PLEASE RECONSIDER!!! (Independently)Their previous movies were funny, so I gave this one a chance (way longer than I SHOULD have).If I was only going to watch a stupid, mindless, funny movie with usually FUNNY actors, ALONE w/ ONLY ADULTS in the room... I MAY have watched the WHOLE movie. BUT, since I was watching w/ my teens, I have to say the language/vulgarity/absurdity was ABSOLUTELTY DISGUSTING!!!I like Stiller and Vaughn. Usually, I enjoy their style/humor. This time NOT SO MUCH!!! (ESPECIALLY, in mixed company!)"
1,Not funny,"Terrible movie. All star cast, but extremely dissapointing. Had high hopes, but didn't get a single decent laugh, and neither did my wife."
4,real funny,"of course with these guys together in a movie,(even though I did not know the indian man) it was gonna be hilarious. I enjoy slapsticky, sarcastic-type comedy and this was funny and entertaining to me."
3,Few funny parts but....,"Overall the story line of the movie was dumb. It had a few funny parts in it, but I was disappointed."
1,One of the worst movies that I have seen,The Watch was a terrible movie that I would never refer anyone to see. I hate that we wasted the money to rent it.
2,Okay but goofy.,Okay but goofy. Not all that funny. The plot does have twists but the story lags. A few good laughs here and there.
1,Just Horrible,"Based on the preview, we thought this would be a funny movie. It is not at all funny. Turns out that the movie is about an alien invasion. Weird, boring, and not entertaining."
2,Glad it was cheap!,"Not as funny as it could have been, plot was expectedly thin. Not one of Stiller or Vaughn's best. A couple of chuckles here and there, but nothing ""laugh out loud"" funny to me. Gotta love Amazon instant video though, HD for $4.99, love it!"
1,Junk,This was possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Witless dialog made up of unneeded beyond crude humor.
4,Not what I expected,This movie is odd. Funny but strange. I didn't realize there would be an alien factor....otherwise I wouldn't have watched it.
2,Eh...,"Pretty much all the funny parts were in the preview. The movie was pretty vulgar, which I guess is to be expected from Ben Stiller and the R rating, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. I wouldn't recommend paying to rent this. If you want to see it, wait until you can watch it on tv for free."
2,When in a bizarre direction and the comedy didn't save it.,"With the big names as main characters, I thought even if the story wasn't too great it's still got to be funny. Right? Well not really. The story went in a very bizarre direction and the comedy wasn't enough to save it."
1,bad language!!!,wouldn't have been so bad if they didn't use such bad language every other word. Not one to watch with the kids.
2,Pretty lame,"Waste of good talent. Writing was poor. Did not make me laugh most of the movie. Com'on stiller, you can do better"
3,Not exactly rock and roll,"Other than a brief, but tantalizing few scenes with Billy Fury, there isn't much charisma in the stars. I bought this dvd for the Billy Fury scenes. Billy is incredible. His image and performances are vital. Wish they'd had just footage of his performances as a bonus on the dvd. David Essex plays his role well, but the character is very unlikable. Ringo is excellent."
5,Excellent workout,"I was hooked after getting his Kettlebell Clinic series. When I can't get to the gym, I reach for his DVDs. There's variety in the exercises and they're timed in 2-3 minute rounds. The timer is shown on the screen and you can see where you are in a particular round. He gives encouragement and you don't feel like you have to get the next DVD to NOT get your money's worth. At times I've had to stop working out when life gets in the way and I reach for his DVDs to help me get back on track. I've gone from 10lb KBs to using 25lb KBs.I bought that Jillian Michaels KB DVD and after trying one of the workouts, haven't gone back to it. If you want a REAL workout, get this series. If you want deeper instruction, get his Kettlebell Clinic series."
2,Horridly Pedestrian,"The mystery that other reviewers ooo and ahh over was crap. I figured it out in about 5 minutes. I spent the whole movie hoping it wasn't that lame. Everything you expect and want from a Cronenberg film is completely absent as another reviewer said. Though the cinematography and acting are superb, the story is lackluster and just not that interesting or involving. I sure hope this isn't the end of the real Cronenberg films."
4,Mental illness at its best!,"Whether you are a fan of David Cronenberg's films or not, this intense mind-blower will give you an eerie sense of what it is like to be in the grip of schizophrenia. Fiennes is excellent as the main character, played with brutal realism."
3,Guther - Sundet,"Guther's SUNDET exists definitely more on the pop side of Morr Music's electro-pop equation, as delicate and folksy as it is. Julia Guther's voice dances lightly across ""Still In This Town,"" and even though ""Statements"" has much more of a rhythmic pulse to it, it still reserves a state of calm. Many of the tracks, like ""Throwing Thoughts"" have a delicateness to them, guided by the acoustic guitar. ""Trick Or Treat"" has a more aggressive approach to the guitars, though nothing that would scare your grandmother. More often, it's the quiet grace of ""Who Was First"" or ""No Need To Mention."" A pleasant listening experience."
2,A lot of truth and a lot of lies,"If they were so peaceful then why did they not just exit the compound? Why have such a long standoff which they knew would end that way? Overall, this book answers a lot of questions and raises more. The conduct of the followers was atrocious and the conduct of the FBI was less than professional, but I must say that I don't feel bad for any of the people that died other than the children who had been raped, physically abused (spanking), and never given a chance."
2,I dont see it.,"I purchased this album having listened to the song ""Broken Glass"" (the only good song on the album), and I was kind of shocked when I finally listened to it. I found the whole album to be very boring. There was hardly any variation between the songs, and sometimes I didn't know whether a new song started or if one was still playing. The singer isn't bad, but definitely over-rated I think. She sings very quietly and her voice doesn't have much variation either. I definitely wouldn't buy this album, but everyone else seems to have left great reviews...so maybe I need to give it another listen."
2,Plain and usual.,"I found this book plain and usual - I was hoping for updated suggestions, I will keep the book, but it really is not the help I was looking for."
4,Got it in time and it worked,"so this item needed to work because it was going overseas and I'm never going to see it again. I have not seen any videos yet but it was recieved well, delievery was just fine. Excuse me but it seemed refurbished, like a display model got the book and cheat sheet."
1,terrible flash camera,"i bought this camera to record my surfing, it says 8 X zoom , but when you zoom the camera it get all wrong with the focal distance.about the lcd, all i have to say is that you can not see nothing if is too sunny, how you can get anything if you can not see what is going on.and the battery life i think is some kind of joke, i recorder no more than five minutes and is all gone.And the worst part is that i live in brazil and can not return the product."
2,disappointing size and color faded within 2 weeks,"I am sorry to say that the pink color of the decal faded to a white within two weeks. As a result, I am disappointed in the quality, and I was surprised that the overall size of the decal was smaller than I expected."
4,"Good quality, but...","Unfortunately, the product features advertised on Amazon are not accurate. It states that there are two rubber tees included, when if fact only one is included. Similar products have two rubber tees of different height, and I thought I was going to get that with this product. Not the case. Also, the two green levels are quite small, 7 3/4"" x 9"" each, so make sure your contact is precise....not a lot of green to work with. That being said, the quality seems very good."
1,Too Dimgwrthien,"Wow! Christina responded to me! She is modest too, since she says she has talent that I do not possess. I can SEE clearly now! Your Daddy published your rag!"
3,unfamiliar Andre Norton,"This is one of two andre norton books I had never heard of. I was startled by the bare-bones format, and understood why these two books were not included on Norton lists of books. She dabbled in a variety of genres. I have collected her books for over 30 years, and am happy to have this inclusion, anyway."
5,All Else Has Failed,"Besides the Bible, I found this book to be the most important factor affecting my parenting. Tripp gets right to the underlying reason for behavior, the heart. And he doesn't focus on behavior. All other ""child raising"" books I have read have not followed the precepts of the Word as closely as this one. Wonderful, convicting, powerful."
3,A little extreme,"I found some value in this book but I simply cannot agree with him that it is ""God's command"" that we take the child, turn him over our knee and spank his bare bottom--and tell him that this must be done because God says so. Way too extreme for me. I also found it difficult to read because of the authoritative way it is written. However, I don't completely disagree with Tripp's intent. I think he has some good points and he believes in treating children with dignity--I just think this book should be balanced with other sources of parenting advice."
1,Foundation misguided,"This book's author is clearly a man who loves the Lord and loves his children. However, I would encourage readers to ""get a second opinion"" before swallowing at face value statements he makes such as ""In these early years of childhood, the rod is primary...because God has commanded it."" (p.148) Your second opinion could come from a Hebrew scholar regarding the quoted passages in Proverbs (the word translated as ""child"" would be better rendered ""youth"") or from consulting another book by a committed evangelical, Heartfelt Discipline by Clay Clarkson."
1,"Sad, Sad misuse of Scripture","I find it very frusterating and sad when Christian authors take God's word and twist it to fit their ideas. Tripp takes way to many liberties with God's word claiming that God says ""this"" or ""that"" Only the bible is God's word, not an author's interpretation of it.Please, please if you read this book, take time to do some word studieson the original text for all the scripture that the author quotes."
3,apes always win...,"I love ape suits. Alot. And Bob Burns is a natural choice to make this dvd. However the scenes he does are pretty embarrasing. It's hard to sit through, it feels pretty clinical. There are some rare clips, and it is a really good doccument of ape movies."
1,Garbage!,"The other reviewers were right!-Short running time.-Clips repeated over and over again.-No history of b-boying. And that is sad considering Crazy Legs and Rock Steady Crew appear scarcely here and there.-Mediocre raps instead of b-boy breaks-Average b-boy moves-Homemade dvd with no extrasI'm very disappointed in this one. Buy ""The Freshest Kids"" instead."
2,Mm... not quite....,"No Postscript support! So no printing under OSX or Linux without jumping through some serious hoops.Colors are REALLY funky. Images are not even close to being accurate.Other than that. It's a great printer for someone just looking to replace a monochrome printer and who only print under Windows. If you have the space for this monster. BTW the support Lexmark claims for OSX and Linux is a straight up lie. They support OSX 10.2, will not work with 10.3-10.5+ and no Linux support at all."
3,Not So Good,No so good.This book has some info that was helpfil but not as much as expected. I will not tell my students to use it.
2,Mini encyclopedia of garden plants,"This is very much a gardening book, offering a selection of the author's favorite plants. The format chosen is a series of brief entries on genera that contain some ornamental species. Each entry starts with a sketch of what the genus is used for, followed by a sketch of some species and what they are used for. A typical entry is a quarter of a page or so. Alternatively such an entry might be described as a few lines on a favorite species, preceded by a few lines on the genus and a few lines on a companion species. Information given is on gardening only and apparently very limited in accuracy (the author proclaims that Coffea has only a single important species!).One in every two entries is accompanied by a color picture of a fifth to half a page. The pictures are of good quality but printed too small (and too dark?) to make this a coffee table book. The book is neither fish nor fowl. Overpriced, from every angle."
4,Good-quality gadgets,"Unlike some other reviewers, I was very happy with the quality of these gadgets. The can opener works very smoothly without a lot of effort required. My favorite, though, is the peeler. My mother had one before I got this set, and I knew I had to have it when I found I actually liked peeling carrots because it was so easy to use. I hope to buy the same set for my sister when it's back in stock."
1,The Secrets of Cabales Serrada Escrima (Secrets of Series),"For those of you that haven't heard of me, I have studied Serrada extensively in Stockton, California. I read the other reviews, and Master Khlid Khan, should not have complimented Mark Wiley. He did so to promote the book because he is in it. Guru Dennis Servaes, also in it and has trained with Grandmaster Vincent Angel Cabales and gave a review which tells it like it is. I would also advise against the purchase of books by Mark Wiley, or anything to do with Daren Tibon. Angel would not have authorized either book, and I cannot recommend either of wiley's books! Too much misinformation. I understand Daren is no longer recognized as a Master!"
1,I HATE IT,"I added this to my registry and thought it was a great thing to have, boy was I wrong. It dries out like 10-15 wipes and even turns them brown. It also makes the wipes smell funny. Maybe it would be better if once it hits a certain temp it turns it off automatically and once they get cold it turns back on. If I could rate it a 0 I would."
2,Hassle and not practical,"I recieved this as a gift and found there were too many problems.It dries the wipes out, especially if you buy the thicker wipes. I suggest going with the really thin, un-quilted kind to retain the heat.The wipes don't stay warm very long after you pull them out of the warmer.The organizer is useless- it doesn't hold anything and it doesn't stick onto the crib very well.I don't know about you, but I don't have an extra outlet and I don't need another cord to trip on in the middle of the night.Still, It's an attractive case and you can buy wipes in bulk and then put them in the warmer."
1,Useless,"Save your money!! This product was absolutely useless. The warmer dried out the wipes, not to mention the moment the wipes hit the air they dried so quickly. Too bad cause it is a great idea, maybe spend the extra money and get the more expensive prince lionheart one."
1,not worth it,We tried this warmer for only about a week before returning it. The warmer part doesn't seal so the wipes dried out after only a couple of days. The pockets in the diaper organizer part weren't big enough to hold powder or lotion.
2,no need for it,"I can't figure out why everyone said I had to have one of these. They really didn't get ""that"" warm and besides after 1 month the unit started to smell funny. It also dried them out a lot quicker and found myself throwing alot of my wipes out. Not going to risk having this in my babies room!"
3,"Works to Warm, Disappointed w/ rubber pieces & diaper holder","I bought this after I didnt get it for my shower. I love it for warming the wipes but holding the diapers is like the other reviews. My added complaints are that the zipper broke to after the 1st month :( Also the rubber holders arent attached to the metal brackets and they always fall off the brackets leaving the warmer to lean sideways and forward the warmer almost falls off! We still use the compartment for diapers. But I have to re-adjust the whole thing daily. I wish they had come up with a better design. Those rubber things are AWEFUL! Are they suppossed to protect the furniture? I am happy to have the wipes warm. But unhappy with the overall design. The ""wipes"" made by: |Especially for baby | are inexpensive and the BEST for this item and work getting the job done."
1,Waste of Money!,"Don't waste your money buying any brand wipe warmer, let alone this one. I used both, the Especially for Baby and Lionhart, and both dried out half of my wipes each time I refilled. Also, it doesn't provide that much warmth for the wipes--maybe ""room temperature."" I used the wipe warmers (after returning them twice) for about two weeks, then gave up because both broke (or stopped heating the wipes!). I don't even think my daughter even noticed when I stopped using them--at least she never seemed bothered by the cold ones. Besides, I have a feeling the containers harbor bacteria and mold (after a while of being moist inside) so it may not even be healthy!!!"
1,Disappointed,"A friend recommended a wipe warmer after he got one for his 4th child. Since the Especially For Baby one seemed a reasonable price, we experimented with it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with either of the wipes we tried - Pampers or Huggies. And the extra storage just didn't provide much ""storage"". So we've taken it back and our daughter doesn't seem to mind the room temperature wipes that clean her cute tushie."
2,Disappointed!,"I loved this product at first and I know my daughter enjoyed it for the first two months. After a while though, it began drying out too quickly and literally burning the wipes on the bottom. The last thing you want to have to do is throw away 1/3 of your wipes because they are brown and dry."
2,The only redeeming factor,"The only reason to buy this is because there are two songs that are by ""The Who"" which you cannot find on any other Who CD. The rest is rubbish. But if you want every recording by The Who and you have every compilation that is available, it would not be complete until you pick this one up. ""Dig"" and ""Fire"" are the tunes done by the orignal members of the group."
2,Talented but.......,"She does have have a great voice but it's being put to such bad use. Nearly every song is just a knock-off on someone else's sound or some style - ""Hey Everybody"" and ""Rock the Roll"" are just two examples of trying to sound cool or hip something.She needs to let her unique style out or find her ""voice"" in the literay sense. I have not heard all of her material but ""I Know You Will"" comes closest on this album I think.I know she wants to be a song writer but she would do well to work with someone else here - read the lyrics for ""Avenue of the Stars""? Ugh."
4,Jennifer is really good,"I've never heard Jennifer sing before,,, I wasn't disappointed , this is a very good cd,, going to go alongside with my favs."
4,better than previous albums,"I'm glad Jennifer Love Hewitt got away from doing the cheesey teen pop vocals. Her album ""Barenaked"" shows that she's got a bit of soul in her voice. I especualy liked the songs ""Avenue of the Stars"", ""Rock the Roll"", ""Hey Everybody"", ""Can I Go Now"", and 'Me and Bobby McGee."" The other songs on the album are okay but they can get boring after a few listens."
3,Good but not great,"A decent Star Trek book marred by 1) too much plot and action; 2) too much of Scotty's self-pity and Guinan's ""feelings."""
5,GREAT Sunday School song CD,"I love this CD! The singing is good...children but on key and not sappy, sing-songy. We use it every Sunday in our preschool Sunday School class, and the kids love it. (Adult helpers like it, as well.) A lot of traditional favorites (though ""Jesus Loves Me"" has 2 extra verses) but no ""If You're Happy and You Know It."""
4,Great,"This is one of those records that came across my desk one day. I was willing to give it a chance. I heard a few songs and it felt special. I felt like I wanted to listen to it again. This band is from Philadelphia and is into the Beach Boys and The Zombies. That sounded interesting to me. People on the east coast are obsessed with the past and record collections. This band is part of the mod revival. It's about the fifth time they have revived that corpse. The A-Sides have played with some of my favorite bands like British Sea Power, Adam Green, and Enon. Every song is a quality tune here. The band's name sounds like a novelty. Let's hope that they stick around. Songs like ""Everybody Knows The Way"" are classics."
2,"Exciting, but TERRIBLY EDITED.","I have read 5 of Mr. Douglass's Seal Team Seven books and this one had the worst editing job that I've ever encountered. The Seals go through their motions and do in the bad guys, but the editor kills the story. For example, Magic Brown the Seals sniper carries an M-88 McMillan sniper rifle on page 223 that becomes an M-93 fifty on page 230 and then he has a H&K PSG1 sniper rifle on page 234. If you like action and can over look all of the errors that a 10-year-old could have caught, then go ahead and read it. But if you want some good military action series, read Bob Mayer's Riley series or Richard Marcinko's Rogue Warrior Series. These guys have actually been there and done that (BTDT) stuff for REAL. Mr. Douglass, the stories have potential but, get a new Editor or a new Publisher. The lack of editing in this book was unforgivable."
1,Lousy,This product is a rip-off. Don't buy it. It doesn't teach you how to play hearts. Just a few elementary tips. Stay away.
2,Great machine if it works...,"I purchased the Horizon Fitness EX33 elliptical trainer in May 2006. I felt like I had purchased quality equipment and was very satisfied with the various levels and workouts to choose from. Unfortunately the machine doesn't work. I can turn it on and the display lights up, but nothing happens. Naturally the one year parts and labor warranty expired 5 months ago. I could understand if several people used it on a daily basis, but I am the only one who uses it maybe once or twice a week. I would have expected this from an entry level elliptical in the $200 to $300 range. Very disappointed!!"
4,GREAT machine for this price,We did A LOT of shopping around and trying out different machines before purchasing this one. Delivery was speedy. Assembly took us under an hour and was actually pretty easy. This elliptical is very quiet and doesn't take up a huge amount of space in your room. It has a nice variety of programs available. My husband and I both use it daily and very much enjoy it. Great machine for this price.
1,A terrible book,"I was ashamed to read it. The art of logical fallacy.The author completely fails to understand the relevant principles underlying the case, and relied on anaonymous personal attacks."
3,NOT FOR The Ranger Edge 2001 or newer,"They list this shock as will fit Ford Ranger Edge... WRONG...it will notThe Shocks on the Edge are 27inches long from Eye hole to Eye hole these are like 19 1/2If you have a Ranger Edge check the specs you will find that they are 7 inches longer due to the lift on the Edge suspension , I koow this because I went back the the parts store 4 times before they got it right...I ended up getting a set of Gabriel Pro Guard/Shocks # 61629 for 25 bucks at Autozone for my 2001 Ranger Edge 2wd...My truck never road so nice, and smoothI hope this helps"
1,Melted bottle first time!,"I couldn't wait to get this home... so my little one wouldn't need to cry while I went downstairs to heat up a bottle. I set this up in the nursery and did a test run. The first time I used it, nothing happened. The bottle remained cold. Then I waited the recommended 15 minutes and tried it again. This left part of the milk scortched and the bottom of my Dr. Brown's bottle melted. This product is complex and unpredictable. I will be returning it today."
3,Better than boiling,"After buying a $10 piece of junk at a local store, my husband and I bought this bottle warmer online. I must say that it is better than heating water in a pan in the middle of the night. However, it is certainly not my favorite baby purchase. The water turns brown after a few uses, which is a minor cosmetic concern. My biggest problem with this warmer is that it does not heat consistently every time. The amount of water that heats it perfectly one time may leave it too cool the next or even scalding the time after that. My only solution is to stand there beside it the entire time it is heating and keep checking it every 20 seconds or so...not the best use of my time. This is the same thing I had to do when heating it in the pan, but at least it makes me feel somewhat safer. Overall, it's only average."
1,save your $$,"the main problem i have with the warmer besides having to stand there and make sure it doesn't get too hot, is the water turning brown and smelling bad....at first my husband and i thought someone had spilled something in it but after cleaning it, it still continues to do it. i have read other reviews on here stating the same thing...i usually end up holding the bottle under hot water...very disappointing for this first time mom"
2,Skip it,"Our experience was a combination of the other reviewers. We had to experiment with how much water to use, but we did figure it out easily. The auto shut off and night light were great, but eventually we found it easier to heat pre-made refrigerated bottles in the microwave, or make them fresh with powder and warm tap water (just shake and serve!). If you go the microwave route, experiment and you'll find the right time - ours was 22 seconds on 50% power (shake, test, and serve!)"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"Am I the only one having problems with this bottle warmer? The instructions say that one chamber of water will heat up one bottle. But my 4 ounce bottles are still cold. Every bottle requires both chambers of water, so in the middle of the night I have to go to the kitchen or bathroom and refill them for the next feeding. Plus, after a period of time, the water starts burning brown and making the bottles smell. I'm constantly cleaning the heating chamber. I love the cooling chamber and the night light. However, I wish the guidelines matched the reality of how much water is necessary."
1,Do not waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This bottle warmer is terrible. Here are just some of the reasons why:Bulky.Have to measure the amount of water. NOT something you want to do in the middle of the night.Will not defrost properly.Will not heat evenly.Will overheat. This is not a major issue for formula but a PROBLEM for breast milk.Cooler will not accommodate all bottles, couldn't use with Dr. Brown.This thing is junk. It's sitting in my closed and I can't even bring myself to donate it to the local Church, as I would hate for someone who's less fortunate to become even less fortunate."
3,A good back up stitch guide,"As a knitter advances past the ""blind following"" of patterns, a good stitch directory is an invaluable item for designing patterns -- even if it's just the pattern for a scarf. This is one of several stitch directories in my library. It isn't my favorite but I still use it regularly.What I like about this book is the photography of the samples. Other books may (and often do) explain the actual working of the pattern better (Barbara Walker's Treasuries come to mind) but you have to be attracted to a pattern/stitch to even want to try it. This is a very good resource when looking for a stitch that strikes your fancy.Of the various volume in this series, this is certainly the most useful for everyday knitting. The other books have some neat fancy stuff but when it comes to relatively basic stitches, this is a handy book to have on the shelf."
3,Review,I was looking for a fairly intense assemblage of uniforms visually with explanations proximal to the picture as I dislike jumping back and forth in books. This small volume does give a general overview and it is useful in general but not for academic research. Recommend it for those interested in an overview but who do not need it for micro-historical research.
4,From the Back of the Box:,"""A Modern Day Tom Sawyer and His Friends Live an Incredible Adventure!:It all began with an explosion late one night near the Charlotte Nature Museum. Who lit the fuse?Duncan McKenna is determined to save his father's museum from further danger and destruction by having the nerve to challenge the town's worst bully.

2,Block defective,"The knives are Great!! The block arrived with several deep dings in it. It looked like the packing was to blame. I wrote to Victorinox, but they said they couldn't handle any returns. What to do? It was for a Christmas gift and time was running out. I was really disappointed. Gave the gift anyway."
2,Just get the sippy-style nippes and use a bottle,"The handles are more confusing than useful for our daughter, she likes to hold the cup itself and tries to avoid the handles. And the handles were really the only thing special about this item because you can buy the sippy-cup-style nipples and just put them on a bottle. She likes that just fine, it's less confusing - an easier transition. This item has basically sat in our cupboard the entire time we've owned it."
4,Good portrayal of the Afghanistan I knew,"I like narrative non-fiction. It takes me to places I haven't been and if the story is written well I feel like I'm there-sounds, smells and all. I read this before deploying to Afghanistan to get a feel for the land and the complex tribal makeup of the country and found it very useful. Lamb's description is spot on and she does a good job enticing the reader along on her journey where most women (and men for that matter) don't have the courage to go. I especially appreciated her insight into the early days of the Taliban and Hamid Karzai's involvement with them. Though the book wanders off subject a few times and is very much about the author more than her subjects, it's still a good read for anyone wanting to understand such a backward culture."
5,This Book Can Transform Your Life Forever!!!,"This book is a reflection of an amazing shift that is happening in health and wellbeing. No longer do you have to follow a regimen that is based on one theory alone. No longer do you have to read and buy all the fad books on Nutrition!I am a holistic health practitioner and I give a copy to all of my clients. It supports them on their journey to wellness and gives them a fresh and simple point of view. It is truly the Future of Nutrition...But it is practical..right now!With love and good health,Vanessa Tricoche, CHHC, AADPwww.alivetolove.com"
1,Piano out of sync with the fingers & orchestra--poor record,Performer shows absolutely NO emotion. Piano not in sync with orchestra and fingering. You see the fingers hit the note and hear the note 1 1/2 beats later. Very unpleasant to watch. The conductor does an excellent job and certainly outperforms the pianist with emotion and feeling
4,Brutally and brilliantly well done,"Garth Ennis' UNKOWN SOLDIER is indeed a tale of dark conspiracy and vicious action, but it is in his detailing of the crushed and confused characters of Agent Clyde and the mythical Soldier himself that he really hits hardest. Even though the narrative spans fifty-plus years of America's military history it remains an intensely chilling personal horror story; about two men's morals and ethics and sanity slipping faster and faster into the mud, and the demands honor makes on the human soul.It is a brilliant limited series, limited only by space, scope and the constraints of the backstory. The keenness of mind exhibited by Ennis and his contemporaries like Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison and Alan Moore is in full evidence here... they are some of the finest (and weirdest) literary minds in comic books today."
4,"Really good action movie, love the changes from the original","We really enjoyed this new version of Total Recall. Loved the way the stay with the original story but different! The visuals and the city, wow -- really would have loved to have seen this on the big screen."
4,Exciting and Suspenseful,"Comparing it with Arnold's movie, this ReKall movie was more plausible and easy to understand the plot. The action is great and the acting was very good. I enjoyed it as an action film and would recommend it."
2,ok,this movie was just okay. Nothing fabulous. I wouldn't recommend it unless you've seen everything else there is to see.
4,Good,Overal good CG; good action scenes. Would have been better if the original story line was kept -still good SCIFI movie
2,Skip it.,"Chase scene after chase scene. Brainless action and despite a couple of clever references to the original, basically no sense of humor. No Mars. Yawn."
3,Ok.,"As a child of the 80s I grew up watching Arnold's action movies and was a big fan. That having been said, I was excited to see the remake, to see the updated special effects and to see Jessica Beale and Kate Beckensale. I would say it was an okay action movie on it's own but did not stand up well as a remake. They deviated from the original story line so much I think they would have been better off giving it a different name. All in all worth renting but not buying."
4,"Not a bad movie, but not a great one.","Not a bad movie, but not a great one. I enjoyed this movie, but I did not love it. It was a good way to pass the time. If you like action movies give this a shot."
1,filled with explicit language and action,"There's a lot of action. However, to much explicit language to enjoy. PG13... parents beware! This should have been designated an R rating."
2,"Lose 2 hours of your life, and walk away feeling only moderately disappointed!","If you've seen with one with Arnold, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed in this one. If you haven't seen the one with Arnold, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed in this one.Of course, I needed to see it for myself to judge, and you probably will too. At least you can consider yourself warned."
4,Really enjoyable,This movie was a pleasant surprise. Non stop action coupled with a good storyline. Much better than the AS version with really hot chicks. I recommend it completely.
1,didn't even go to mars,not as good as the original movie. they cut the mars out of the story. kinda pointless. colin farrel was good in the movie but the rest of it sucked.
3,"Entertaining, but didn't love it","Kept me entertained, but honestly I like the older version a lot better. I also think that this movie would have been a bit hard to follow had I not seen the other version first."
1,Bad Audio Sound Track,"Would be a good movie, if the audio didnt drop out like every minute, so annoying you can not enjoy, will just piss you off. Sony needs to fix this. This movie is going back to the store. Lots of info on line about this issue."
1,Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,"Blu-Ray is FAULTY,.. maunfacture defect, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Freezes in same spot on both of my players. Freezes at 1:45:46 (1 hour 45 minutes & 46 seconds). I have read that many, many people are having the same problem. Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Blu-Ray is FAULTY maunfacture defect DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!"
2,Could have been better,"Could have been better, and I thought the lead actor did not do such a great job with the role, The worse part was the ""fake wife"" she was just horrible.... please...."
2,Not quite satisfying remake,"I couldn't help but recall the original and want for this one to live up to or exceed those expectations. There was potential, but it was hardly reached. If you're just interested in something to be on the tele while you're doing something else, then this will be fine. If you're looking for a thrilling action film, you may want to go for the original instead."
2,not even close to being as good as the original,"More time was put into the special affects than the story WAST OF MONEY, this movie strayed from the original story quit a bit.very dissapointed"
3,better than the first version,"The quality and acting ability of Colin Farrell in this movie, for me, just proves Arnold really couldn't act back in the original, and he can't act now.."
4,Good remake,"Fun, action packed movie! Good cast that bring the story new life in a high tech world. Must see it."
3,Nice!,good movie!! I love it. <3 amazon rocks I love AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAZOOOON I doing this just to feel that I am doing something at work and in order to answer some questions
2,Terrible remake of a great movie,The setting for this sci-fi thriller was impossible to figure out. Why would workers be commuting from Australia to Britain? And through an underground tunnel system that takes 17 minutes for the trip? The script writer might have visited Total Recall himself.
2,Disappointing,"Some rave that this is just different enough from the original to make it entertaining. Well, it may be just that but it's not different enough from a hundred other modern action films to make it entertaining enough. The cast doesn't measure up to the original - nor does the environment. Mars made the original a real sci-fi film whereas this could take place anywhere on Earth. Here, this could be any one of a hundred different films and you couldn't tell the difference. Sure the effects are better than the original but not enough to win an Oscar like the original did. It's sad to see how easily entertained people have become in the last 20 years. Farrell doesn't have anywhere near Arnold's presence, who was surprisingly good in the first one. Plus he had the physical build to make it much more believable that he could take on big opponents."
2,"Exciting plot, poor script","I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It definitely kept my interest. The problem was that I felt like I was walking down the hall in Jr. High. The main characters seemed to know only two words: the a-word and the s-word (okay 3--I think the F bomb was dropped). When the use of such words is redundant, it sounds like they have an IQ of a mosquito. These guys are supposed to be incredibly intelligent operatives. Their language made it unbelievable. I wish filmmakers would catch a clue that swearing lessens the quality of the film. I don't think I could stand to watch it again for that reason."
2,Lame,"They shouldn't call it total recall, should if called it something else. It was a decent action movie that's about it"
3,TOTAL RECALL,"I THINK THERE WAS VERY GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS, BUT I LIKED THE ORGINAL BETTER. COLIN FARRELL GOOD, BUT NOT ARNOLD!"
4,Kept me glued to my seat,What a thriller. Colin Farrell did a great job. I liked it better then the 1st Total Recall with Arnie.
1,A Completely Unnesesary Film,"Ultimately, it only makes the audience scratch their heads in confusion. Why make a less good version of this movie? Couldn't this money have been spent on something original? Paul Verhoven is still alive. Why not pay him to keep making more hits?"
1,Not what I expected,"A lot of hype, good casting but the story line was not what I expected. It was certainly not worth my time watching it."
3,It's okay,The special effects were great - the plot is what you would expect from an action movie - not a bad watch though
2,"Pretty effects, but characters aren't sympathetic, and story is fragmented and seems incomplete","Many references to the original film with Schwartzeneger, but the characters here are a little bland. The last half of the film seems rushed, and you really don't connect enough with the characters to care."
3,What a Waste!,"Compared with the 1980's Arnold Schwarzenegger version, this has terrific special effects and terrible writing. I don't understand why you would spend the money for great special effects and an A-List actor like Colin Farrell, an A-List actress like Kate Beckinsale, and then settle for D-Grade writing. Are good writers so hard to find in Hollywood?Pah! It is worth watching, once ... maybe. Rent it, don't buy it."
4,Very Good.. Arnold U Are(Were) the man!,"Colin Farell is not Mr. Universe by any means and to be honestI was holding back on watching this movie in the Theaters becauseColin has never struck me as a Bad Ass! But I will give him Full Respectfor this Movie. Do not under estimate this movie by any means. If you watched the1st Recall with Arnold Swartztoomanyletters < close enough;) then you will notbe disappointed! Okay so i will be the first to admit,this is hands down a muchbetter movie the second time around.. Could be the fact that CGI is much more believable,or they just did a much better job at the Plot, but there is no way I would bare to watch another actionmovie with Arnold again! He will be back, NOOOOO!!"
2,not as good as the origional,"Too much action, not enough story. Skip it!ignore this fourteen words. one two three four five six seven eight. more words required."
5,Good Action Movie,Being someone who does not usually watch action movies my husband picked this out and I actually enjoyed it. It is a very entertaining movie.
1,totzl recall,I was very let down by this movie. It was all over the place and all that ceative weirdness of the orginal film was not at all in this one. WHERE'S QUATO!?
4,Total Recall,This was a good remake of the old movie with lots of futuristic/tech innovations that the old version did not have.. Would recommend it!
1,Sucked compared to Arnolds version.,"This Hollywood types ought to try and come up with a fresh idea and if they have to remake a movie they have to go over the top , which with this floparoo they failed miserably. Total Fecal would be a much better title."
5,Colin Saves The Day!,"When Colin Farrell is in a movie I am never disappointed and here again I was thrilled to see him looking the part and bringing his body of work as an actor to do the best he could to remake a movie that has just been tarnished by the original star. But Farrell pulls it out and puts emotion, physique and believability to his character who we root and care for. Unlike the original drone-like actor who really depended on the set to move the movie Farrell plows through the set and pulls an otherwise sinkable script off the ground and gets us to care and believe in the world we see.Other movies where Colin Farrell brings great characters to live and have great scripts areIn BrugesandA Home at the End of the Worldbut each role he plays I applaud this once innocent young actor who has taken control of his craft and given us some great films to enjoy again and again."
2,Total Recall Review,"I had high hopes for this movie, being a Colin Farrel fan, but I was not impressed. The writers chose to use the S-word over and over rather than using more thoughtful language. The idea of not knowing what is real or fantasy is interesting, but was not developed well. I kept waiting for a plot twist that never came. Also it was just one chase scene after another without much of anything else.The futuristic scenery was interesting, nevertheless this movie was a total waste of time."
3,Much Thunder but No Lightening,"Did not live up to the hype and did the original a huge injustice by straying way off the beaten path from the original story line. The special effects and action was the movies only redeeming qualities, however, the story line was woefully lacking."
2,Boring,"The movie was one endless chase scene. The settings were beautiful; however, the story was weak. If Jessica Biel wasn't so damn hot I would have rated it a one-star."
3,Not enough to the story,Not enough to the story. A lot of special effects but I was not emotionally engaged. Was not charged by the characters.
3,You'll like the original more!,This movie did not hold my attention. It was a bit to busy to really follow. CGI was okay. I enjoyed the original more.
3,New vs. old = old was better,Average action and special effects... Was different from original... Maybe that's why my expectations were already pre-set... I liked the original better overall...
2,Sorry sleept through this one,Good sleeper movie or background noise while your catching up on FB or reading something better. Did not watch to end...zzzzzz
2,Just Awful,"While the movie has nice recognizable stars the plot makes absolutely no sense. So, there's this tube going thru the middle of the earth... for some reason one side of the earth wants to invade the other... why doesn't the other just destroy the tube?!?! Maybe I'm missing something here..Some decent action in the movie.. maybe.. I guess..."
3,Decent Reboot,"Cast and special effects in this reboot of a scifi classic were phenomenal. However, it's basically the same story and same predictable outcome, so the movie wasn't as suspenseful as it could have been. Definitely a rental and not worth buying."
3,"Don't Expect the Same Story as the Original, But You'll Wish They Did","If you didn't enjoy the original Total Recall because you thought the story needed a reboot with weaker dialogue, an uninspired plot, snazzier CG, and hotter women... this is the version for you. Do not be surprised when you find yourself nodding with the truth in my review as it's a pointless relaunch. The only reason for it is if there's a a second and third one behind this one. And I can totally see that occurring if potential investors never let this slide into their bluray player."
4,Better than the Original,HIgh action thriller. Much better production than Arnold's version back in the 80's. CGA was great and the action was terrific. Colin Farrell did another credible job in the lead role and the ladies were great.
1,Total Recall = Total Failure,"I do not recommend this film to anyone looking to watch a good film with good acting and things that make sense, like when a trained cop or a super droid shoots at them, they would probably be dead right?...oh no, you won't get that here. It's cheesy, lots of cliches, bad acting, etc. Just wait till it comes out on TV and you'll thank me."
2,"Many pieces, but no whole.","There was no discernible plot, even less character development and a complete absence of a coalesced underlying meaning to tie the numerous scenes together to convey a unified theme.At the end one is left not knowing what really happened and what's worse...one doesn't care, but one does appreciate that it is indeed OVER.Watch the Arnold version again and pretend that it's the newer version."
4,Total Recall,I thought this movie wouldn't be that great because the original movie with Arnold stunk but surprisingly this remake was so much better.. Worth the watch..
3,Just Ok,"Pretty predictable as a remake but some different twists. Effects were really good and excellent on surround. Overall entertaining, but only a rental"
2,Expected better,I expected so much better especially since the original was so great. This seemed like a cheap knock off :/
2,Meh,"So many things are wrong with this movie, for one I waited for release onto on-demand and thank goodness for that."
1,Skip this one if you like the original.,"What a waste of time! This is not a remake, this is garbage. Awful movie! Nothing like the original ""Total Recall"" Watch this crap only, if you like stupid and exaggerated action movies."
2,Grrr. (SPOILER),"This didn't make sense to me. In the original movie, what the resistance was fighting for made sense. In the original, the resistance were fighting for oxygen/natural atmosphere. In this remake, I'm not clear what the fight is about...class warfare? Workers in the colony who only work in industrialized ""New Britain?""Don't like that Colin Ferrell killed Kate Beckinsale, the pretend wife. Better in the original when the girlfriend offed Sharon Stone (playing Schwarzenegger's pretend wife). And I didn't like the Obama money either...is this more ""worker"" symbolism. The political undertones take away from the enjoyment."
2,When did 3 boobs become PG-13?,"This movie had some great twists and great effects. Unfortunately, one of those effects was ""nudity"". I guess, as a Mom of 14 year old, I thought that PG-13, would not have nudity in it. Just glad that we saw it before we watched it with our kids. Can someone tell me when nudity became okay for something other than an R rating? They could have left that whole part out, and it would have been fine. So sad, that they thought it would be a better movie for the young and old when they decided to even spend money on that part! Just goes to show, you can't trust the rating system anymore! Signed, A Sad Mom"
3,remakes...go figure,"Some things are best when left alone. Although modernized with updated technology and cinematography, the original with Arnold Schwarzenegger is a classic not to be tampered with."
4,"Good Action, Fast Paced","I enjoy fast paced action, so I gave it 4 stars. I would recommend it to others. Good. Picture. Quality."
3,Not as good as the original,"The special effects are very good, the plot is ok but starts very slow, yawn yawn, but the acting is far from an oscar. HAd I known how bad I would never have watched it"
3,"Not good, Not bad...","Just an okay movie. It has good action and the plot moves along nicely, but I thought the original movie with Arnold was much better."
3,"Better than the original, but....","Before you scream at me for saying it is better than the original, I made that decision based soley on the limitations that the original film had, I always felt that it was attempted too early.The acting for the most part was a sleep walk, Mrs Biel phoned her part in from so far away that buying the long distance carrier was probably part of her contract. On the other end of the spectrum though was Kate Beckinsale, she sold her part so well that I all I could think of was that she was channeling a very personal bad relationship termination in her head the entire time.The film seemed to be rushed from start to finish, I understand that it was an action movie, but but even a shoot-em-up needs something more than this.I don't regret watching the film at all, as mentioned before KB more than made it worth it, but I still wished there could have been more to it."
4,First rental,"Nice action flick, Good twist and i like the idea that they took it to a different level vs the original"
4,Only flaw was calling it a remake,"Was actually a pretty decent movie. its only real flaw was calling a remake. There are very little similarities to the original, and the similarities to the original are almost skipped over so fast you barely realize it. Great action, Decent story, im not a huge colin farrel fan but i tolerated him because it was an entertaining movie."
4,Good movie,good movie over all. Action love story of the future. I would watch it again and buy it. Would recommend
3,Could've been better,Should of been better. Love the cast but the action and the story left me disengaged and looking for something else
4,Unexpectedly Different in a Good Way,Great special effects and nicely modernized. This movie can stand on its own but also complements the original very well.
4,Action,"Movie provided plenty of action. A slight stray from the original but enjoyable non the less. good use of effects, keep you thinking"
2,Sure Makes You Appreciate The Original Even More!,"Watched it part ways and I don't think I could stand much more of it.I approached this movie with an open mind with reasonable optimism, but 30 minutes in and I'm ready to turn it off. I'm not the kind of person that mindless say ""oh the original is always better"". If the remake was better, than he was better. Unfortunately, this was nowhere near the entertainment value as the first. Arnold, you've spoiled us all."
2,Unrealistic and incredibly predictable,"The plot line of this movie is awesome, I love sci-fi and particularly post-apocalyptic movies. But this movie was extremely unrealistic and totally predictable. It is entertaining but it was a little painful to finish. My husband watching the first 20 minutes, fell asleep, woke up for the last 10 minutes and didn't really feel like he missed much. He had no desire to watch what he missed."
5,recall,good film great cast good villain good action very confusing at times not as good as the original from 1990
4,"Great reinvention of the original ""Total Recall""!","I initially was very skeptical of this movie, as I am a rabid fan of the original movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I was very pleasantly surprised, as this reinvention of the original story did a great job of integrating classic dialogue, characters, and scenes into a truly unique, fast-paced, and exciting movie."
3,Good remake but missing something important,"Half way through, I forgot to care about the main character. I remember being very concerned about Arnold's predicament in the first Total Recall. This version fell short. Maybe the focus on the wife was too much. This sci-fi world is worth every penny to experience, however. So, it gets 3.5 stars."
3,It was worth the $2.99 rental,"I'm not going to buy the movie to keep but it was worth watching once.It's not a remake of the original movie, but still makes for a pretty good action/adventure movie."
3,Pointless remake,"I like Colin Farrell, but this movie was a waste of time and money. It is essentially a high tech remake of the classic with the addition of one long shoot out. They changed the movie from one with a plot to essentially a chase scene from begining to end."
2,The original was better,"This version tries to be more of a ""thinking"" movie than the last one but it doesn't work. Not terrible but not great."
4,Excellent Textbook,"This book, a book I am using in my graduate study of social psychology, is a useful guidebook for anyone interested in the subject. I recommend it to anyone!"
2,"Very Mediocre Contents, Terrible Aesthetics","I was very disappointed in this book and judging from the steady decline of the resale price here on amazon.com, I can see others agree.First of all the book looks like it was photocopied in someone's basement - the text is completely faded out and paper feels terrible. For almost $100, I expect a little more.The actual contents of the book are not much better. I found Royden (the required text for our class) to be very sparse and was hoping for something to fill in the details. This book did little to help. It covers integration in a rather idiosyncratic way, devotes little time to differentiation, and says nothing about convexity.If you are looking for a good anaysis book I recommend either ""Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space"" by Frank Jones or the slightly more abstract ""Real and Functional Analysis"" by Serge Lange"
5,"Easy to use, covers well","I bought this to spray paint my radiator and it did a great job. I sanded off the rust first, then put cardboard behind, and gave it two coats. It looks great, and the spray did not go all over the place."
1,this product sucks,this product is defective. Bag is too small for frame. This would be a great toy for cats it were made properly.
1,Horrible Stuff,"This stuff is EVIL. I had the most horrible pain and itching after using. Within minutes, I wanted to die. Almost went to the ER. Couldn't wash it out fast enough. Endured horrible pain for hours. Was swollen for days. STAY AWAY. Can't believe it's on the market."
1,I don't feel Magical when cleaning the leaks up..........,"I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good. Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak. My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star. Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup."
2,No Handles!,"These cups did not come with handles, and the spouts are green, not white. Not what I thought I ordered. Very disappointed."
1,Worst sippy cup I have tried,"I have a 13 1/2 month old daughter, and so far I have loved every Avent baby product I have tried.These sippy cups, however, were very disappointing and I am upset I wasted my money.My daughter is a sippy cup pro (Nuby, Munchkin, Playtex, and Born Free cups all work for her) yet she has difficulty drinking out of this cup and has to tip it straight up into the air and suck hard just to get any fluid out whatsoever. Don't believe me? You try it! I certainly did. And the top part does LEAK. And yes, I have read the assembly instructions.There are superior products out there. Avent, you need a product redesign. Other parents, don't waste your money. I would recommend Nuby, Born Free or Munchkin instead."
4,Never Had A Leak!,"I will first admit that there are additional parts to these cups that need to be washed, but since we used Dr. Brown's bottles, I was used to a few pieces.The soft spout on these cups is great, and made transitioning to a cup SO easy for us. My son hasn't taken a bottle since his first birthday, and never missed them a bit. There are two levels of spouts, one harder one softer. I've tried other soft spout brands, but have had leaking from the collars. Avent cups NEVER leak as long as the valves are inserted correctly. Our little guy will use any brand or spout type, but these are his favorite and nice on sore gums.I really recommend these cups despite the extra valve pieces (which I simply pop in the dishwasher in a basket). You'll never have spills on your sofa or carpet."
2,Too many pieces,"I bought this cup for my 7 month old son because the description says the child doesn't have to suck as hard for the water, juice etc. to come out. The first thing I didn't like was all the pieces - the cup, the handles, the ring, the spout, and two different disc inserts --- TOO MANY. Also he had a hard time drinking from it because the spout is so different from any other cups I'd given him. I let my 2 year old daughter try them and she didn't like the spout either. I guess if you first introduce this cup and nothing else then your child may do well. But if they are used to the other rounder kind they probably won't like this one. Not to mention all the pieces that can get lost!!!"
5,Four Seasons a Winner,"This is the second copy of Vivaldi's Greatest Hit I have purchased. I liked it so much, I decided to buy another copy to give my 15-yr-old nephew, who is a violinist and lover of classical music. He loves it, too, so two thumbs up from this reviewer."
1,A good story badly told,"This is one of the worst books I have read in quite awhile. The author claims to have spent time with a group of tech entrepreuners in the Washington D.C. area during and after the internet bubble. There is some really rich material here, but the book is poorly written. There is no flow and there are abrupt transitions and it is not always clear when the incidents she is relating actually happen, because they are not always in chrononological order, unnecessarily confusing the reader.A terrible job of writing compounded by some very poor editing. If you are looking for insights on hwo these men made and lost fortunes, look elsewhere."
2,"Rich Canvas, Sparse Drawing","As a DC area resident, I was excited about reading this book. It does have a number of interesting stories and anecdotes, but the book as a whole lacks flow and detail. After spending time on one of the figures, Ms. Henry jumps on to a new topic with little to no transition. Also, you'll find that there is little insight into the title--""how the masters of the internet universe rode the rise and fall of the greatest boom in history""--you'll learn little about what they did on the way up or on the way down. The book makes it clear that Ms. Henry was an observer and not a confidant."
1,Nothing we haven't seen before.,"I found this book limited; the author was handed opportunity for deep insight in an increasingly relevant topic and missed the opportunity entirely. Not nearly the insight of Barbarians at the Gate or other classics that have been written since. Most painful is probably the editing; she re-tells anecdotes several times, which grew tiring."
2,"Russ who? Raul who? Masters, I think not.","Russ Ramsey, the name doesn't really bring up grandious visions of leaders, tech or wealth (like, say, Gates, Jobs or Ellison). And for good reason, no one knows who the heck he is. You wont recogonize anyone in this club for the most part. Washington, DC doesn't really bring to mind technology no matter what Henry says. I picked this book up and read about half of it and just couldn't go on. Henry's subject matter is insignificant and way off course. I didn't see one deal they made pay off. Almost anyone could make a buck back then, but not this club. This book is a dollar short and a day late, or maye even five years late. Henry could have made fun of this group, the material is all there, this could have been the book version of starup.com. but Henry, like the club members, misses.To quote: I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me as a member. Well, I wouldn't belong to a club that allows Henry to take notes and then publish a book."
4,Who Came First,"If you are a fan of the Who, you may agree that some of the original songs that appeared on the old vinyl LP are probably some of Pete Townshend's best material. According to interviews I've read, Pete was at a crossroads in his life, and spent some time with the late Mehr Baba. I like to think he may have been on the right track when the original albumn was released. At any rate, if you haven't heard the material, you are in for a treat."
4,Worth the wait,Unlike some other reviewers/purchasers I never got around to purchasing this disc in its vinyl form. Too bad for me. I love it and what a very pleasant surprise to find that 'Evolution' is in fact 'Stone' played and sung by Ronnie Lane accompanied by Pete Townsend. For me this alone was worth the purchase. I only wish I had bought this a long time ago and I could have had all those years of pleasure.
3,Suena Un Poco Monotomo,"El disco tiene un buen sonido, mas clasico que en sus discos anteriores (desde 2001, Vengo Con Todo), pero todas las diez canciones suenan casi iguales, que hace el disco sonar monotomo. Las voces suenan bien, ya que Ismael ha cuidado su voz durante las decadas. Las canciones fueron ya cantados por otros cantantes, especialmente la primera cancion ""Dejenme si Estoy LLorando""; en 2005 en ritmo de merengue por Joseph Fonseca, y hace unas generaciones atras por Roberto Ledesma. El disco seria bueno para la gente que ya conocen las canciones, pero la salsa en este disco no es bailable, es casi dormilon como el disco de Gilberto Santa Rosa ""De Cara Al Viento"" de 1994."
5,Breathtaking,"This young American from San Fransico spent three years, from age nineteen to twenty-two, as the Wailers' lead vocalist, despite not having any prior professional singing experience; one listen to his voice, and one can understand why. Elan often sounds as though Bob Marley came back to earth just to drop a few new tracks, particularly on the gorgeous song, ""I Wanna Yell,"" a song he wrote after travelling the world and view economic injustices wherever he went. The album showcases his talents through songs that are dancehall, reggaeton-esque, and just plain reggae, and features guest singers Tami Chynn, Assasin, and Cutty Ranks.A classic!"
3,Advance Wars 2,"Bought this game as a gift for my Nephew. He enjoyed it but after finishing the game, got bored when he was playing it again."
5,Advance Wars 2:Black Holes Rising,This Game kicks the **** out of the first one. the battle graphics are awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Science-Fiction + War Tactics = Blah,"The original, Advance Wars, was a great 5 star game that combined strategy and a fun storyline to create a great game. The downfall of this game was adding science-fiction. The new neo-tank looks like a meteor with a gun and the new COs are really quite creepy. The added pipeline feature makes no sense, why should you have to control one section of pipeline to cross? Last, after all the reviews and coverages I've read about this game the only new unit is the horrible neo-tank. That is why it deserves a 2."
1,PlayStation 2 Muhammad Ali Pack with Signed Gloves,"this is terrible, even it's in one pack, but why they ship them seperately"
4,Does just what it says!,"I needed a clarifying shampoo that didn't contain sulfates, so after reading reviews on various sites about avalon's lemon shampoo, I decided to purchase it. I used a bit of this in preparation for my Aphogee Protein Treatment, and it really cleansed my hair without making it feel stripped. I'm guessing what I got was a new formula because the label looks a little different than what I see here. I believe they added in more essential oils. Nothing bad...It smells really good too!"
2,Sticky and Stinky,"I bought the product to provide a clarifying option that was organic. After reading reviews I was very excited to try it out. However, this shampoo smell is so potent. It left my hair feeling heavy and limp. It was a big mistake. I pity all that purchase it. I only gave it two stars because the ingredients are so good, too bad it smells and feels so bad."
2,Not a fan,"I was excited to try a different organic shampoo. I have alot of thin curly hair. I was really hoping this shampoo would volumnize it as it claims to do. However, I have only used it 4 times, and it actually seems to make my hair more flat. :("
5,the best hot sauce,"we looked all over for this hot sauce, we first bought this sauce in atlanta. could not find it here in cleveland, my husband love this hot sauce I wish I would have thought about looking on amazon a long time ago. even my son , who live in atlanta could not find this hot sauce. thank you amazon, for this service."
1,Crap,This thing is a piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe they sell this for 19.00. The size is for a 2-4 yr old not the 6 and up which is what the product description says!!! Very cheaply made the wooden piece that held the strings up was not even glued it just sat there. The finish was horrible I would not recommend anyone to buy this for there child.
1,Woodstock Percussion Guitar,Was super excited about the price and the toy for my son(4 years)! He had it not more than an hour before it broke. It is not durable and if the strings are tighten ( a little too tight) the neck of the guitar snaps! Its a cheap toy ..it should be worth five dollars at the most if that! Save your money and look else where.
1,Junk - don't bother. Spend a little more for something you can tune,Nearly impossible to tune. I'm a guitarist and struggled to get it somewhere near in tune. It's just not worth buying. Even a novice or a small child with any interest in playing will want something that can stay in tune. I believe $40-$60 will get you a decent 1/2 size guitar.Do get this if you just want to display it or perhaps for pretend play. It is small and cute.
1,Poor Quality,"My sister bought this guitar for my son this Christmas 2008. It has been broken for two weeks already. I didn't mind the sound quality because this guitar was meant just for fun, but I can't believe that the neck snapped after a few weeks. If your looking for a good sounding guitar, you will need to spend more money. This guitar is just the right size for a two year old, to bad it isn't anywhere durable enough to handle a two year olds normal play."
3,Outdated Software,"While the labels themselves are ok to use with modern CD labeling software, beware of the software that comes with this package. It is from 2001 and is not compatible with current operating systems."
3,Giants womens hoody,"I bought this for my daughter, and it's kind of thin, more for spring time. It runs small, the size medium is the same size as a 14-16 in childrens's so I had to exchange it for an extra large, which is more like a real size medium. Keep that in mind when you make your order. Really nice hoody though, I reordered another one for her. She loves it."
3,Hardware,"These speakers sound ok but the hardware was junk. The screws were soft metal and stripped out instantly and the wires were broken. This I didn't find out until after they were installed, so I had to do it twice."
5,moon machines,a fantastic doc for those who no the story but want to hear the detail a great lesson in just how they pulled it off
5,Absolutly FANTASTIC!,"If you enjoy seeing period film and listening to the people who made history, you will love this. I huge amount of pleasure for not much money. BUY IT!"
4,An excellent overview,"This DVD provides an excellent overview of various systems that contributed to the Apollo lunar landings. It doesn't drop down to the layman level of understanding, yet doesn't reach into the esoteric. It deals with some areas not normally see - such as the Apollo ""space suit"" - contains some footage that is not widely seen, and is well worth viewing by everyone interested in the history of the Apollo programme."
5,shepherding the heart,This book addresses the challenges we all face as parents & provides answers that go deep & resonates truth. My relationship with my 3 little ones has greatly benefited!
1,Wrong on so many levels,"Being a Christian mother, I was recommended this book and was literally disgusted with some of the points Tripp tried to make. I will not get on my soap box here but I will say this. I have an autistic child and through simple behavioral classes, I've learned that even with a special needs child who can be even more frustrating, you never have to lay a hand on your child. His biblical references are not in correct context. I don't recommend this book to anyone. Parent with love and positive reinforcements."
1,Misapplication of Christianity,"Although this book purportedly takes a Christian view to child rearing, it is misguided and dangerous. The orientation toward physical punishment--especially in the case of infants--is very problematic."
1,Child Abuse Clap Trap,"Beat your kids in secret to avoid the law...spank infants who cannot yet understand English...don't build your child's self-worth, because it's unbiblical...children are evil and sinful even in the womb...completely break them down to submit totally to your will. These are but a few of the ""pointers"" in this child-hating, child-abuse-encouraging book."
1,Ignorant Author,"This author has no education in relation to the psychology of child-rearing. It is appalling that he is able to publish such horrible advice on child-rearing, and a testament to the breadth of our First Amendment. Children should never be hit to ""teach,"" because it teaches fear, it teaches that hitting someone smaller or more vulnerable is ok, and it causes aggression. Deana Pollard, Law Professor."
1,Again?,"Will these authors ever stop taking the easy way out of learning how to parent a child? All this book teaches it to hit and hurt. If your child does something that is wrong, you are to act like a child yourself, and instead of teaching them the right thing to do, you are to hit them. There are already enough books about lazy parenting. We don't need another."
1,"Abusive, Sad, Pathetic, Perverted.","This book is a poor excuse for sad and lazy parenting. The child learns that you rule because you are bigger than he or she is. This is a great way to make your child hate you and also a great way to teach your child that violence, abuse, and that control of others through fear is ok. The person who follows this book is a PERVERT an ABUSER and SHOULD NOT BE A PARENT! This is not my loving understanding and accepting God. This is proof that evil forces are at work in the world. It makes me ill to even think someone would follow this advice much less give it a postive word whatsoever. Shame on all those who reviewed this book positively."
1,"Dangerous Book, Bible Verses out of context","The author of this book makes it very clear he believes children are evil from the point of concepton. As a result diapers should be removed and children should be whipped on the bear bottom as soon as they do something you don't like, crying, exploring their enviroment etc. This is a dangerous book that encourages parents to distance themselves from their children, to ignore their inner voice and beat the tar out of their babies in the name of God!!! And to tell their children from infancy they're being beaten because God orders their parents to beat them. So much for a loving God.The author knows his actions are wrong and encourages parents to conduct these beating in private to avoid being arrested and put in prison for child abuse!!! If there's nothing wrong with this form of child rearing in the author's eyes why does he tell parents to keep it secret?"
1,There is no heart in this book,"There is no heart in the book ""Shepherding a child's heart"".This book views children who misbehave, disobey their parents or forget to do something as sinners and encourages parents to spank their children in order to exercise their parental authority. The book describes in details how to apply this unjust and degrading practice. The book confuses discipline with spanking. Discipline comes from the Latin word disciple which means to teach or to lead out.Spanking doesn't bring about a better human being it only hurts a childs body, heart and soul."
5,Shepherding a Child's Heart,This was a very good book. It is balanced and focused on raising our children using the Bible as our guide. It does not advocate abuse.
1,In Jayden's Memory,"Child abuse on paper; child abuse in practise. Child abuse sanctioned as long as it continues to be written, sold and an organization makes money off the pain and suffering. In memory of Jayden Kaylee McMullin, (Lady Bug), age 3, just 6 day's shy of her 4th birthday party, beaten to death in front of her 5 1/2 year-old brother who ""survived"" with a life sentence, Calgary, Alberta, Canada."
1,"Threw it in the trash, this advocates child abuse!","I loved the idea of this book. The title alone was so wonderful. I love the imagery of shepherding my children to Christ. I loved the first 30 pages or so and then Ted let his twisted side come out. He says that the Bible commands us to spank our children, even infants and he says that if we do not we are disobeying God! What Bible is this guy reading? The ""rod"" in the Bible is meant like the staff of a shepherd, to lead and to guide, not to beat a baby! The rod is also a metaphor for the Word of God, i.e. the scriptures.He doesn't just casually mention spanking either, he goes on and on and on. He hit his own 8 month old child for crawling near a book shelf after he had been told ""no"". That's just sick. When I read that I marched right over to the trash and threw the book out."
3,Interesting,"We are using this book for a Sunday evening study. So far, it has been a great discussion tool for our group."
1,towels are fine - service stinks,"Warning if you try and order these: Be prepared to wait 3-4 months, even if Amazon lists them as 'available' when you place your order. I ordered towels, hand towels, and washcloths, and between those three sets of items, I received 7 emails stating that shipping times were delayed at least a month. In fact, the orders were placed in January and I am still waiting on some items, and just received another email that they are delayed until may. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Go buys towels somewhere where you can leave the store with them - the towel quality is fine, but nothin better than any store you'd visit."
1,Can't ship to a FPO/APO????,"This company will not ship to FPO/APO addresses. This means that U.S. citizens serving in the military abroad and their families are not entitled to buy towels from these clowns. Strongly suggest that you folks in the US consider this company as only profit-oriented and not supportive of your troops in the field. Man, I HATE TO MAKE THIS AN ISSUE - SO WHY DOES THIS COMPANY MAKE IT AN ISSUE?"
3,It really is a bootleg album!,"For those like previous reviewer who are reliving great memories, this set will be welcome. But caveat emptor: these are true bootleg recordings complete with poor sound quality and audience voices (no doubt the sound pirate chatting with his friends). Why didn't they use soundboard recordings? I love the Tarkus suite, but having four versions of it, each in low fidelity, is a bit much... Also, the liner notes are very sketchy. Not much effort was put into this release, altho the boxes are handsome. I was going to buy Vol. 2 but now I hesitate."
3,Sounded good but failed,"Overall the pedal seemed of good quality. Had great sound up until about 30 minutes after I started playing it: the rate knob just stopped working. It was replaced by a slightly audible high pitched ""tweedling"" sound. Sent it back."
1,Wrong item!,I ordered this item (8-pin mini-DIN Male-Male cable) for Keyboard extension on a Sun workstation but instead received an RCA video cable.
4,Just took my 7-month old to the pool - Perfect,This is great. My son loved it. He was secure and kicked away under the water. Recommended :)
5,Great!,Great Price. Both my sons enjoyed this at the beach and the pool. Easy to inflate and easy to travel with.
3,Buried Treasure,"This 1980 compilation of quotes is a real find. It is a general collection, arranged by topic, taken mostly from _The New York Times_ and various newsmagazines. The quotes are trenchant and pithy, and would be a fresh discovery to those who are only familiar with the big annual quotation dictionaries. Some examples:Cocktail Party: A hundred standing people smiling and talking to one another, nodding like gooney birds.TV: What we have is a chatterbox-equipped nightlight.This is worth searching for."
1,doesn't work,"i purchased this for my small dorm room, set it right next to my bed and there was no change in humidity. you have to stick your face on top of the mist to even notice a difference. it lasted 6 hours at most, it woun't even last a whole night."
4,The only small humidifier but use for small rooms,"I use this in my 90 sq foot office and it works great. You will need to fill 2x per work day, but it is so small and easy to carry this is not an issue.It adds respectable humidity to a small room, I would not recommend for a room larger that 100 sq ft.It easy easy to clean in the bathroom (no kitchen sink) at work becuase it is small."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF ^(^%,"ok, first of all i bought this thing because its reviews werent bad at all AT FIRST. I bought this for my mother. Gave it to her. SHe loved the blue light and very quiet. ONLY BAD THING WAS...it quit working within 2 weeks. It runs, light turns on, but no water sprays out. I lost receipt and now a over sized night light on MY dresser. UGH. If anyone knows how to fix this damn thing please let me know."
2,A letdown for lovers of Raptor and Journeyer,"It seems that I, unlike most it seems, am a bigger fan of Kidder's lesser read works (Raptor & Journeyer) than his most popular (Aztec & Aztec Automn)...although all have been well-worth the reading. Regardless, I've tried to get through this book twice and haven't made it...in comparison with his previous efforts, this one falls far short."
5,No Brainer,"This was my first Yakima product. Very happy with this purchase. Item is simple to use, sturdy, and does the job needed. Now upgrading to a Yakima bike rack for the car."
2,I ordered the wrong size,I normally wear a size 9 but the shoe was too small. So I had to return the shoes and got my credit back on my Amazon points.
1,Horrible,"The awful remixes that make up the majority of this disc are disgusting. I like house music, and this is not good house music. It sounds like a mambo rednex!Do not buy this!"
3,Lego Fire Hovercraft,"This was a challenging toy to put together, but my son loved working on it. The only unfortunate thing is that it's not very durable to play with as the pieces tend to fall off alot. Too bad Lego can't make this stay together permanently. It now sits on his shelf."
2,Some situations may be too upsetting for some kids,"Since none of the other reviewers mentioned this, I thought I'd let people know that there are a number of disturbing events (like beheadings) that may upset some children. The book uses the word ""prostitution"" once, which might raise questions if your child hasn't encountered this word yet. I'm not saying don't read it....Gladys was an amazing woman and the story is fascinating from start to end. I just wanted potential readers to be aware so that they are not surprised (as I was). Amazon lists it for children ages 4-8, but it seems like it is more appropriate for grades 4-8."
3,Decent first starting set.,"If you don't do a lot of cooking and you just want the basics this is right for you. It does what it's supposed to and you can throw them in the dishwasher, instead of hand washing like you do with higher end products, without feeling guilty. I wouldn't purchase for myself again but I would purchase for a ""new"" cook."
3,"Not a Farberware, poor sharpness & steel quality","Definitely not a Farberware. A few knives aren't even sharp and steel quality is very poor. I will make a use of steak knives, they seem to do their job... One of the big knives is the worst, because the blade is heavier then the handle, so it's hard to use it safely.This set is much worse quality than a couple knives I bought at ""Conway"" store a few years ago. This should give you an idea not to buy it. Add a little more money and buy something much better. Do not buy it as a gift!"
2,Save the money and buy a better set,"These really are not great knives. The serrated knives in the set are OK, but the other knives just can't get sharpened enough to be of serious use."
3,Good advice but writing style a bit boring,"There are definitely some good ideas in here. The author tries to keep things balanced by presenting the pros and cons of each approach, as well as appropriate situations for their use. While there is little source code in the book itself, the author has a vast repository on his website that is relatively bug-free and easy to understand.My major gripe is that the author's writing style is way too dry, and even interesting subject matter can put me to sleep. While it's nice that the author avoids being preachy, a little bit of enthusiasm would have been nice."
1,why this is not a good book for you,"This book is out of date, it is not the newest clinical guideline therefore it is not useful in any way unless you need to compare what has changed, but you cannot treat a patient with out of date guidelines."
5,Brilliant,James Smolesky is a genius and this is a remarkable example of his brilliance. He's my dad too so that skews my review ......a tad. :)
2,Probably would've liked it better if my eyes had been shut too,"Meandering, frightfully self-centered; if having little moral value was the underlying intent of the film as a reflection of modern society, well, then it achieved its goal. But otherwise, it was turpitude - didn't make it more than halfway through, and even cut short, I regret spending the amount of time on it that I did."
2,Great read,"This is the third in the series by Sara Donati. All three are excellant books and she follows the story line extremely well from the beginning of the series. Having lived and grown up in the area in which the story takes place, I am familiar with locales, etc. Very well done!"
5,Father-Son Relationship,"Ms. Donati has yet, again, written another superb book! Having read ""Into the Wilderness"" and ""Dawn On A Distant Shore,"" I was somewhat disappointed that the relationship between Nathaniel and his newly disovered eldest son, Luke(luc) was not further explored as I had expected it would. I would imagine that meeting a son you have never known for the first time can weave a story of its' own as Luke went from being an only child to having a brother and two sisters. Not to mention the relatives in Scotland. With that aside, the book itself was wonderful, and like the others, I could not put it down. Ms. Donati's writing is so enthralling, no matter what the story line, it just draws you in and makes you wish you were there!...When can we expect the next one?"
3,Fell A Little Flat,I would have to agree with another review that the romance between Hannah and Strikes-the-Sky fell a little flat. I loved how the relationship between Elizabeth and Nathaniel developed in Into the Wilderness. It went into detail and really showed you why and how they fell in love. For Hannah and Stikes-the-Sky I felt it was just skimmed over and under developed and such a short part of the book. I wanted the details of that relationship to make up more of the book. I'm glad the love between Elizabeth and Nathaniel was not lost though even though there was more of a focus on Hannah. Apart from that I still very much enjoyed the book and have nearly finished the series. I highly recommend it.
3,"Good enough, but...","It has some good elements about the places and the characters, but some situations are comically presented (Killer Rabbits!) that spoil the whole dark mood."
1,"uninteresting,in the most boring domain in ravenloft.",A boring book with no horror in it.How could the demi-plane od dread have some sort of nature/elemental connection that can be harnessed in a dance? Ravenloft has too many zombies in it! A dark lord that is not really a villan.
1,Not worth the money,So disappointed in this video that I even contacted the company. This is a re-mix of a lot of other Shape exercise videos. The arm section for example is just a remix of Mari Winsor Pilates. The pictures on the back totally misrepresent the sections as there is no exerise that includes hand weights as the photo suggests. Dont waste your time or money.
5,Great Insight Into Gnostic Thought,"I love learning about the history of Christianity. In my opinion, after years of careful study, this is the original message of Christianity and what we have today is the heresy. Gnosticism is something like Buddhism, and enlightenment is something you have to work at. The Orthodox Church seems to have hidden the answers so well that they themselves can no longer find it. The Gnostic Gospels can help if you understand the Gnostic thought process. There's many books and a long journey ahead for those seeking Truth, and this book is a must read for any Gnostic. Even if you just want to know what they believed without yourself becoming enlightened, you won't be disappointed. It'll at least make you think, and chances are you'll want to get more books on the subject and investigate further the Gnostic beliefs."
5,An odyssey in old China,"Masterfully interweaving history, culture, and characters, TIENKUO takes readers on a fascinating journey through 19th century China. It was a time of imperialism, trade, drug, and feudal wars. We are introduced to a variety of people caught in the vice of history. The adventures and love of an American missionary's son and an alluring woman named Black Jade are the focal points, but along the way we meet soldiers and mercenaries, warlords and rogues, merchants and nobles. And we are escorted through a little-known, exotic, and compelling time and place.This book can be read by teenagers, young adults or adults for either entertainment or educational purposes. Students and teachers of Asian studies or Asian-American relations can especially benefit from it. History truly is made of the lives of the many small people caught in its great movements. TIENKUO gives us a delicious taste of a little known time and place and makes history come to life."
4,One of the best!,"This CD really is fit for banquets, if you don't have live musicians, it will put ambiance at your feast! Of course, the music is from the late part of the Middle Ages, as we don't really know what it sounded like in the Dark Age.Most of the tunes are quite lively, just like the atmosphere of your event should be! I personnaly most enjoy Robin Hood and the Tanner, as I'm trying to learn it by heart. The accent of the singer is ouch!, but ...All in all, one of the best Medieval music CD I've listened to, even if a couple of tunes are boring."
5,"Finally, A Book That I Can Sit Down and Read!!!","When i first saw the book i thought it would be stupid and childish, but it wasn't once i started to read it i couldn't put it down.This book is the only one of the series i have read but i'm looking forward to going and reading all the books in order i'm going to get spy girls the first series and reading it, but hope by the time i get done reading the last book that there is going to be anther book out, and Elizabeth Cage if you are reading this i just want you to let you know that your book is the one out of a few that kept my attention for a long time you are really a good writter and don't let anyone tell you different."
5,Wonderful mixture of fact and fancy,"""Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel"" is the story of a gentle camel transported to the Wild American West before the American Civil War. As part of the US Camel Corp, our hero is all camel-he spits and he is stubborn but, that is the true nature of camels as his mother taught him. As a good Muslim camel, he must adjust to the idea of non-Muslim masters. The US Camel Corps was begun to see if camels could be used by the Army in the Southwest to carry supplies to remote locations. Great book for 5th and 6th graders and they will need a map of Egypt and the US to understand all the many details. This is a good book for a class to read along with formal studies of the Middle East or the American West."
3,Exactly what i ordered,These boots are exactly what we ordered. Did have a small hole in the top but it did not go all the way through. Was going to return them and when requested to return them was given no problems. My son decided he wanted to keep them since it was hunting season.
4,Great New Take on the Vampire Genre!,"It's good to see a new voice in the vampire genre who doesn't lean on old cliches and the like and Karen Koehler is one such new author. Her novel, ""Slayer"", sets up a very dark, gothic and industrial world for a maner of supernatural characters to play, thrive, and die tragically in. Her take on vampires is unique, and its always good to see the lesser known myth of the dhampir come into play.Now, this isn't a happy novel. It's very dark and dismal, but that's part of its charm. The action scenes are top rate, and Koehler doesn't skirt around dark issues. Her style reminds me of Nancy A. Colins, but Koehler is more poetic and sees the beauty mixed into her world while Collins makes sure to paint everything in an ugly light.This is a dark, beautiful, sad, gothic, and cutting edge vampire tale. I highly recomend it."
1,Should be called Facts and Fiction About Your Face,"This book claims to contain facts about the human face. Instead it is a mishmash of presumed facts, theories, and popular science blended with factual information on forensic science and facial structure. The author makes no attempt to distinguish between fact and theory, which substantially weakens this book for research purposes. We work hard as librarians to help students distinguish between fiction and nonfiction, truth and hoax, fact and theory. This book will not find a place in our library."
1,"So, my face began as a wormlike animal in the sea?","This book starts with a strong evolutionary plunge into the depths of the ocean: ""FISH FACES. That's pretty much how we began, say scientists. Our human faces originated with the rise of creatures such as a Pikaia--a wormlike animal about one-and-a-half inches long that swam above the ocean floor."" A balanced approach between the scientific approaches...which often recognize God as the Creator...would bring this book into my library. The point that many scientists believe ""Someone"" created our faces is ignored."
4,"Practical, solid advice for beginners","The title really says it. I don't really like woodworking classes, because there never seems to be enough time in each session. Just when you get rolling, it's time to go. This book helped me take steps to get out of the classroom and start creating my own shop at home. I like the fact that the authors not only advised which power tools I needed first, but they reasoned why I didn't need other power tools, some to begin with, some not at all. That's great when you consider the money involved.Getting two perspectives from the authors (woodworker hobbyist and master woodworker) is nice. I got a sense of learning from true, personal experience. It's not the only book I read in the shop, just part of my foundation. If they came out with another one, I'd read it."
4,Works great on 360,"This worked fine once it was set up correctly. Don't use the disk and go into network settings to search and select your wireless profile. It took a bit to find it, but once it did the internet connection was great. Much better deal than the $90 one."
5,Works Great,Setup was to just plug it in. The xbox 360 knows all about it and sees it as a wireless network adapter.I wanted this one over the other because it has an AC adapter. Thinking about heat and my old xbox 360 doesn't need to supply power to an external device. Another plus for me is that I can place it away from all the other electronics. It connects to the xbox with an Ethernet cable so the wireless adaptor for me sits on the top shelve.
1,Prepare to throw this out your window...,"It DOES work for the XBox 360.....when it feels like it. Buggy doesn't even begin to describe it! For some reason, this piece of garbage only fully connects at night...is it a vampire? I don't know.Drops out of connections ALL THE TIME....and then takes fifteen minutes to reboot...just to DROP OUT AGAIN!!!!I hate this thing almost as much as my original XBox!What is WRONG with you,MICROSOFT?!??!?"
4,works great for 360,this works great for 360. Install was easy. Like other reviewers I didn't bother with the dvd.i took one star off the rating because it requires an external power source (you will need to plug it in) unlike a usb-based adapter.
1,doesn't work with new wireless modems,this product does support new security for wireless modems save your self the hasle and just order the new wireless addapter for xbox
4,This Book,this bookl is very very good. I have used it many times it helps me to understand what my dreams mean and what in my life is making me see these things on my sub concious level so that I can grasp them in realy life. This is great book!
1,Awful,"I've read and enjoyed other books by this author (i.e. Aurelio Zen mysteries). This effort, however, is terrible. The main character is a naive dope who is totally unlikeable. You don't identify with him enough, or for that matter dislike him enough, to care about what happens to him. The plot is pedestrian and predictable. I wouldn't have finished it were it not such a short book.I'm truly surprised that this author, who has demonstrated the ability to write entertaining books, failed so completely this time around. This book regresses to the level of a first effort by an unskilled writer, simply imitating the conventions and plot devices of the genre...Yuck!"
2,Disappointed,With technology today I was very surprised to hear this CD. It was not even in stereo sound and labeled mono. I would have thought it could have been remastered. The sound quality is something to be desired and I would not order this again.
1,Bad disc,"This was sold to me as a new product. I don't believe it was. The songs are great, but ""God Bless America"" skipped and jumped and was obviously scratched."
4,Wonderful,"I can watch this hour of flowers and birdsong over and over and never tire of it. Lovely images, sounds of water, easily identifiable floral plants & trees. My senior patients enjoy identifying the flowers and reminiscing about their gardens.Hoping for a DVD version."
5,Good Book...,"I love this book! One of the best Star Trek books ever. I love the plot, and the way it was told. I love the parts when they show Data surching for something to believe in. This book is a one oin a million! READ IT!!!"
3,Good and Bad,"Haynes Manuals have always been the best on the market. I've used them for several vehicles I have owned in the past. However, I was surprised that this one does not measure up to the rest.For Series I and II XJ6s, this book is very good. It covers all the topics with easy step-by-step instructions and has plenty of pictures and charts to go with it. It's with the Series III cars that the book falls flat. The book was originally written for the first two series with info on the IIIs added in a later revision. It seems the section on the IIIS was more an after thought than a revision. Information is hard to locate, the pictures and charts are not as numerous and some information just isn't there.Overall, this is a good, cheap starting point for anyone who wants to do-it-yourself info on the the XJ6. However, if you want more substance and detail, stick with the Jaguar Shop Manuals. They're pricey but worth it."
1,not a very good manual,upon trying to use this manual for a 1986 jaguar xj6 i found that the information i needed was very hard to find if it was even there at all. the troubleshooting section is an absolute joke.
4,Artiko Watch,"Nice watch for the price. Over all authentic verified; however, the watch came with some scratches on the band. Small scratches, but for the price I was somewhat ok with it."
4,Good Product,This product was a Christmas gift for my 9 yr. old son. He loves it. It is very easy for him to use. He shows me how to use it!
5,Two Thumbs up!,"Yep, this book is for real, and so is evocation. Except you wouldn't know it from the goofy stuff being written about it these days! I got this book, studied the process, and am working toward my first evocation the RIGHT way and have already had more strange ""coincidences"" happen to me than ever before. And real pleasant ones too. As if the hole effort starts to attract to you just exactly what you are after. I also found a lot in his book, ""Kabbalistic Handbook"" which made things even clearer for me so I suggest you think about buying that one too if you get this one on ceremonial magic.Oh yes. The author does have a website and there are tons of free information and magical thoughts and questions from readers and his answers to them as he answers his readers every week as some other people pointed out here. This man gives a lot in his books that are pretty cheap and then offers a website too! Now THIS is how people should do things if they want to write! Check `em out!"
2,Not Much,"This book, in my opinion, does not have a lot to offer. Essentially it is an alleged 1655 edition of the Heptameron with detailed commentary on how to perform the ceremony.The chapters that come before contain a ridiculously stupid version of history leading up to the present time (which isn't surprising since most occult books have a ludicrous view of history); passioned and arrogant statements about how ""Modern Era Magick"" supposedly doesn't work because of the hippie mentality; lists of ""axioms"" the author deems to be true; the constant warning that the practitioner of magic needs to do everything EXACTLY as it appears in a magic grimore or it will fail/make the practioner sorry.Although some points Lisiewski points out I agree with, especially how lax modern practioners have become, there is so much other baggage in this book that it is difficult for me to recommend."
5,Suggestions for other reading affording similar enjoyment,"Of the novels written last century, four stand out: The Manuscript Found in Saragossa; Maldoror by Lautrement; Epitaph of a Small Winner by Machado De Assis and the other I forget, no matter! Similar in style and of the present century is George Perec's 53 Days, regrettably incomplete. Alfau's novel Locos may also prove to be of interest."
2,Get a better one,It does light up :) but I could not even adjust the flame!I recommend spending some more money and getting a better one.
3,OK for the price,"I bought this to use along with my Coleman stove for cooking at camp. The quality isn't great and it's smaller than I thought it would be, but for the price it's not bad. The burners are hard to adjust and it doesn't work well when it's windy, unless you built a windscreen around it.If your looking for a stove that's small and light, then you may like this. Otherwise, spend another $30 and get something better. I doubt this will last for many years like a quality stove will."
1,Disappointed,"I loved season 1 to 3, and I gave season 4 a chance, even though I loved Claire. This season had some good moments, but for the most part it felt slow and too dramatic. I was and am very disappointed with season 4. Finally Nick and Tess marry and there is not a little while of happiness, the next big problem arrives. I am cured of McLeod's daughters. I have no urge to see season 5."
1,TERRIBLE,Only reason I bought this film was for a college class as 99.99% of the dialogue was so hard to understand in class I needed this to try to write a paper on the film. Basically if you need this film for a class buy it otherwise this remains an outdated film not worth the time to watch it.
5,Cinematography excellence!,"My Brilliant Career is the most beautifully filmed movie I have seen. If you were to pause nearly every frame, you would have the equivalent of an impressionist painting - beautifully balanced in color and texture, and always with compassion for the landscape, the characters, and the story. Set in a period of economic hardship for Australia, the story's characters struggle between conventional expectation and individual fulfillment. Strong performances by a stellar cast, amazing cinematography, and a timeless storyline made this movie the big breakthrough for Australian film making. I am so pleased to have found this wonderful film to add to my library!"
1,Wrong title for this book,I just bought this book and wanted to look at the listbox events and properties. The whole control does not have an entry in the index. The backcover says it covers all controls. It's not true. I am returning the book to the bookstore. I am not getting a full refund but this book is not worth much.
1,Another Book on How To Mess Up Your Children!,"Clearly, this is just another book on how to mess up your children! Many countries have come to their senses outlawing corporal punishment while this country is still messed-up! And books like this is what causes children to be messed-up and they become messed-up adults thus needing therapy! The writers of such books and the people who take their advice should all march into a therapist's office!!!!"
1,Obedient sheep-like children,"It amazes me that raising a child is equated with making life easy for mom. How about the child feeling understood, welcome, and worthy? This book pretends that little children have all the faculties of older children and can be indoctrinated so as to be little automatons. They will fit in beautifully with manipulating demigods, and are being trained to not question authority at all. Not the citizens I want to inhabit this country. Why use this book when there are so many more balanced ones that truly use Christian and non-violent principles to raise healthy, respectful, welcomed, and happy children who will become our fellow adult citizens? Because it's cheap? Come on!"
1,Misleading,"I bought this ""book"" for my wife and we discovered it isn't a book at all, but rather a fold out paper poster. I should have been tipped off when I saw the price was $4.00. It truly isn't worth the 4.00 I paid for it and it should NOT be described as a book."
1,"Buy this if you want to beat your children with a stick! If not, pass it by!","Ginger Plowman is a well-known child abuse author. She twists the bible's sayings into convincing her readers into beating their children. So buy it if you want to hurt your children, and their spirit, not just their backside.Boo to you Ginger Plowman!!"
5,"This book helped me to quit, 2 & 1/2 years ago","I had been a reluctant smoker for 30 years, knowing I was killing myself, but incapable of following thru initial enthusiams of quitting for any length of time. While this book was not the only way I finally quit smoking, it was a substantial help. It gave me a scientific, biological basis for understanding my (to me) freakish addiction that defied my own common sense.The book was also entertaining. It's not a quit smoking guide. The author never was (foolish enough to be) a smoker. It helped me to see my smoking from the ""outside"", truly. I hope it comes back in print."
4,"The perfect mix of mystery, romance and medical suspense","Dr. Claire Elliot and her son, Noah, move to Tranquility to rebuild their lives after the death of Noah's father. Claire is considered an outsider and finds it difficult to build her medical practice as well as gain professional respect from the townspeople. There is a sudden unexplainable outbreak of violence among Tranquility's teenagers and Claire learns that this same phenomenon occurred roughly 50 years earlier. She feels confident there are biological reasons for the violence and is met with significant skepticism. As Claire struggles for answers, Noah begins to exhibit uncharacteristically aggressive behavior himself.Bloodstream is the perfect mix of mystery, romance and medical suspense. Tess Gerritsen lets a few loose ends behind but for the most part pulls everything together in a cohesive and exciting story."
1,Badly written and fundamentally silly,"Familiar devices, cardboard characters and flat, insipid writing. Any reader with an ounce of sophistictaion is going to find this very tiresome fare indeed. These days, thank Heaven, you can find good thrillers (even the odd medical one) that are actually well written. This just isn't one of them."
1,Stephen King must have insomnia.,Found this book slow and have read better high school senior book reports. It was drawn out with a hurry up lets somehow end this book ending. Not my idea of aa all nighter. Went with Kings recommendation. He should stick to writing not reviewing.
2,Surprisingly bad!,"I picked this up after seeing the high rating it's received here. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The story had me interested enough to want to finish the book (thus getting an extra star) but the writing was terrible. The type of book where characters come across important pieces of information but instead of testing or exploring, or, heck, even bothering to tell anyone nothing gets done. In fact, some elements you are certain will be relevant later on completely disappear. Events you are certain will cause trouble for characters later on are completely forgotten about. On top of the poor storytelling are occasional snatches of writing that were so bad I had to just shake my head.And this is her *third* book?"
4,"Bloodstream was an intriguing, yet puzzling book.","While BLOODSTREAM was a captivating and intriguing book, it was puzzling as well. Can such creatures really exist? Is this a realistic situation? The characters were most realistic and believable.Any mother can relate to Dr. Claire's frustration and anxiety. This book was definitely worth the read."
4,A chilling and fast paced read,"Dr. Claire Elliot takes her son Noah away from Baltimore and moves to Tranquillity, Maine. Every 50 years or so when the rains are heavy and summers hot, the community's teenage boys, boil over with uncontrollable rage. Desperately hoping all the violent occurrences have medical causes, Claire comes up with a variety of theories, all of which involve placing a quarantine on Locust Lake, the town's main source of income. The real cause of the terror is even more ominous and frightening than Elliot ever imagines."
3,chicco activity walking toy,"this toy is colorful, not a lot to do on it.. but my 1 yr old likes to walk with it."
2,Dangerous for early walkers,"In my experience, children that are in the early stages of walking need something a little sturdier to hold onto. This doesn't offer enough traction (even with the ""brakes"" on) to make it a safe toy for getting comfortable on their feet."
1,T.e.r.r.i.b.l.e.,"It stings, and doesn't do anything. I've used this for years now, thinking it was working... just finally noticed how with clean and clear this stuff and face wash, I haven't had a clear face since 3rd grade. (I'm 19) :[[ I just have oily skin, random break outs all the time, not too bad, but seriously... can I just have a clear face most of the time? Instead of never see one? Going to a dermatologist soon to see whats up. And in Jesus name I receive my clear face!! :DDJust saying though... everything ((except for the oil blotting clean and clear sheets-love that stuff)) from clean and clear doesn't work for me. I'm sure it does for some people. Every body has to find, I'm sure, what fits there exact skin type."
3,You get what you pay for!,It was a toss up between 3 or 4 stars. They just don't stay charged very long. Make sure you buy two at a time. Vendor was quick to ship and no problems dealing with them.
4,Fun for one but not for two... Ironic?,"This was a gift I received and I found that the double-headed experience was not working for me and my girlfriend. The Length is just too short for us and it kept slipping out. Now it may be we aren't used to double-headed toys so be your own judge. We both enjoyed its feel when used on one woman at a time, however, and the toy just looks too damn sexy to throw away. I still give it 4 stars given the price."
4,Makes you want to take a road trip,"Pete Earley's book provides an incredibly rich account of the many facets that make Vegas the city of dreams: the book details the stories of individual dealers, gamblers, prostitutes, dancers, ""weekend warriors,"" casino barons, etc. Super Casino begins with the rise of the mega-casinos -- funded through loans from a Mormon-run bank and junk bonds -- and ends with the grandiose projects completed at the turn of the century.It is the people in this book that make it interesting. The reader feels the energy that drives individual ambitions and dreams. While not every story is a happy one, every story is an interesting one. I gave it four stars only because the book is a bit ""light"": while entertaining and a quick read, it doesn't really attempt to delve beyond the surface details of the stories presented."
4,Speedo bathing suit,"The suits are great, but I had to order several in each size becausethe sizing was funny. It only gave bust size and notthe regular size with it. So I had to order 3 different size suitstill I finally got the one I was looking for. The tags on the suithave both sizes like 12/38 but when ordering only the one size is given.PB KRAL"
5,Video works fine now.,The engineers at Amazon got this video to work now. It is playing perfectly and I will be purchasing the other season as well
4,Enlightning,Enjoyed the historical bases for the show. Learned a lot about the early days of medicine. The actors are wonderful!
4,Fascinating Historical Drama,London Hospital gives you a front seat view of life in long ago London before anitbiotics and the advances of anything approaching modern medicine. The only problem with the series is it is not long enough!
5,Great season 2,We started watching this because there was nothing good on. We got hooked.this was really an eye opener. We are so lucky for the great health care weall enjoy in today's world.
5,weird movie,I love this movie. when i first bought it i thought that it was going to be a prequel or sequel to the MKR series. But its completely different. All the evil people work for Princess Emeraude. Clef and Ascot are more grown-up and Ferio is working on the dark side.
1,Is it over yet?,"I bought it, watched it and hated it. Why? There's really no reason why you would like to continue watch it. I haven't seen the series (yet) an I think it will take some time before I do. The story is... well what is the story really? I don't recomend this DVD at all as you never get a grip about what's happening. For example. Someone appears, and if you haven't seen the series, you won't know who it is. Try to find something else, the series looks intressting. When it comes to graphics and sound, it's good. That's not a reason enough to buy it. Please don't make the same misstake as I did."
5,Good anime,"This ova for magic knights rayearth was good. I loved the artwork and story-line was good considering it is only 3 episodes. I like that they changed the characters a bit, and what happens to each of them too. The love aspect was played up pretty good too^^ I do recommend for anime fan to buy and have in your collection. P.S. I do recommend watching season one and two first to not get confussed watching this ova."
4,No More Kidney Stones,This book gives a lot of very good information about Kidney Stones and how to reduce and prevent them a would recommend this book.
1,Horrible Elbow catch,"This item is absolute and utter junk. If it is your intent to use this product to to keep anything closed, think again! I tried to use it to keep a cabinet door closed and the spring is too weak to do that. Think of a double, commercial base cabinet. One door is locked to the second door, and one door has a elbow catch. It's an inexpensive and common way to keep a door locked. Unfortunately the catch is too weak and too round to be effective. You can simply tug the door handle and the catch gives way.Don't waste your money to buy this product or your time & effort installing it!"
2,I love History but....,This DVD bored me. Sorry. The premise was interesting but I found as the DVD played on my attention was elsewhere. It should have been interesting as I have never heard of this story surrounding the Princes in the Tower. Read the synopsis and forget the DVD.
1,WHERE IS THE ZERO-STAR OPTION?,"The 'troubled' hairpieces sitting on top of the young actors' heads on the cover should have told me something...Besides having endless droning narration and, more offensively, employing 'moving cow' camera work (where the camera never stays still, in an attempt to demonstrate a kind of realism), this film has no script. Able actors, yes - but nothing else.Look. If a producer won't spend the money, or even worse not notice that money wasn't spent to make his lead actor's hairpiece look realistic, and not like a wig bought at a Walmart's After Halloween sale, it's unlikely they will pay any more attention to their overall production, which in this case is abysmal.Tantalizing history. Find it elsewhere."
3,This could have been a winner...,"IF the loop that goes over the button was elasticized. It isn't. I've used turbie-esque hair towels for over 10 years now, and am quite attached. I have long hair and short patience - regular towels are no longer acceptable if I have a choice. The cloth on this item is already lacking in stretch, which can be awkward and aggravating. But when the loop that goes over the button has NO give to it? I just go running back to my stick-the-point-through-the-loop models. This one is at the back of the closet for some imagined laundry emergency that would have me using all my old turbans (even the ones with the over-stretched elastic) and no way to wash them. In other words, The Apocalypse. I see neither event occurring in the foreseeable future, so I won't be purchasing this again, and do not use the one I have now."
3,A bit too tight for my head!,"I'm trying to wear my hair naturally wavy and want to ""plop"" my hair (I read ""Curly Girl"" a few weeks ago). This does absorb a lot of water and if I don't leave it on long, my hair doesn't drip (my hair is 3-4"" below my shoulders), however, it's tighter than I'd like. Perhaps my head is also too big! When I put it on, the button is at the nape of my neck and even if I only twist it once, it pulls so that the hair by my hairline dries too quickly. Sometimes it leaves my hair flat on top if I'm not careful in the way I put it on, due to the fit (vs. the accordion effect I'd hoped for). I'll work on refining my technique."
3,Seems okay.,"I have had this for awhile. It's the first time I have ever had a turban...I'm still getting used to it. I LOVE that it isn't as heavy as a towel on my head! Only downfall, is it seems a little snug on the elastic."
2,Not true micro fiber,"I bought this against the reviews that sited this towel does not work as well as previously owned microfiber turbans. I wish I listened to them. It really doesn't work well and, as stated in a previous review, doesn't even work as well as a regular cotton towel. My hair naturally dries quickly, and with a true microfiber towel it dries super fast. That is not true with this. I will need to buy another product."
1,A bad bad bad book,"Is a bad bad bad bad.... book. No code, no examples, no explications...El libro es malísimo para ser de programación. No explica código, no tiene ejemplos, explica demasiados temas absurdos, por ejemplo en sonido explica como usar programas midi y ni una linea de código.Es una autentica estafa."
1,"ordered in Oct 18, no delivery until Dec 23","HEY, WHAT's going on in your delivery system ???!!!!!Two months passed, I still haven't got these damn books!!!! Isn't it enough time to send something to the Moon in two months!!"
4,Nice and portable,This is a pretty good thermos. I like that it is small and can fit in my briefcase but it's size also makes it difficult to clean. The coffee I put into it remains hot all day long but it only holds about 1.25 large cups of coffee. This works fine if you get your coffee in the morning but you may want a larger model if you plan to have coffee from the thermos in the morning and afternoon.
4,Keeps it hot.,"Just what I was looking for. Nice, easy to handle,streamline shape. Keeps liquids hot ALL day. Holds the perfectamount of liquid for me. It has already survived a fall intothe street!"
5,LMZeller,Got this for my daughter so she could take warm water to mix with baby formula when we go out for the day. She loves it.
5,lid withstood the garbage disposal,I love this! My son is 16 months old and still on whole milk (BTW - You cannot find whole milk in the milk box containers). If we are traveling or out for the day I just pour the whole milk into this thermos and it stays cold for at least 12 hours - ice cold. It holds 16oz - toddlers are supposed to consume 16 - 24 oz of milk a day so this is perfect for 2 servings. The lid went down the sink drain without my knowledge and I ran the garbage disposal - it only has a couple of dents and still fits on the thermos! This is exactly what I was looking for - perfect.
4,It is pretty good,It is good and I like it. the function to keep warm is pretty good. I give 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because the appearance is what I like best.
3,"Sturdy, but not soft","While I like the workmansip of the pillowcase, the fabric seems rougher than I'm used to even after multiple washes."
5,"""The truth about the vatican""","This story is true however the names are changed. This story is about the vatican and what happens when satan did come in the house of the lord. The book was written as a novel because names were changed to keep the guilty from sueing Malachi Martin. Evil and murder was covered up by the highest level of the church. A must read about evil that can come between certain people who some never drempt of. Melachi Martin was found dead after this book was written. He had been beat to death in the middle of broad daylight. The scary truth is the vatican covered up the murder and ruled Mr. martin fell and hit his head. However another doctor said, He would have had to jump from a building to complely crush his head like that"" and no one saw anything on a buisy street in the middle of the day. A demon? Maybe?"
1,Interesting but slow read with a cliffhanger ending,"This 500+ page book slowly builds to a crescendo of murder, coup de etat, satanism and evil. Unfortunately you never know how it all turns out as the last portion of the manuscript was evidently omitted. The author is now dead, so there is no chance for a sequel. How FRUSTRATING!"
2,Leyenda templaria sin emocion,"Cabe recalcar el excelente trabajo de investigacion historica hecho por la autora, la descripcion de lugares, costumbres y caracterizacion de la epoca medieval son notables. Sin embargo, ella ahonda demasiado en hechos triviales, que terminan por aburrir al lector. Se nota la intencion de incluir cada momento historico de la caida templaria.La autora carece de aptitud en mantener la prosa y el relato vivo, en especial cuando dispones de la versatilidad de caracteres de ficcion como Ricardo, Aymer y Beatriz quienes son los protagonistas de la obra."
5,Peleliu 1944: The Forgotten Corner Of Hell (Campaign) [Paperback],"The author, as with his ""Battle Order"" series, does an outstanding job of researching and describing this ""forgotten"" battle of WW II. It's well written and very techincal and accurate. A must read for any serious student of WW II.John M. Budish, Sr."
1,not true channel-in application.,"Instead of using clips to lock them in, this uses thin 2 sided tape but they are mounted on the inside. Don't buy this."
4,A frozen Hell,A good but not overly technical account of a little known war and the incredible bravery of the Finnish soldiers against overwhelming odds.
4,Great Book,"This is a truly great book. Trotter does an outstanding job with Frozen Hell. He was able to retell a story that many are not aware of. However, if there is one criticism it is in the detail. Many people often complain about some history books not being vivid enough in their recount-- not this book. In some ways the author delved too far into the context of the battles, and the book turned dry in some instances."
3,Hard to follow,"The book provides quite a well rounded basis, with good diagrams, but some of his calculation methods are a little hard to follow. I much much preferred Orbital Motion by A.E. Roy. It depends though on how you are used to seeing the formulas. I know some people find this book much easier."
1,DoD:S: A complete failure,DoD:S is nothing compared to the orig. They didn't keep any of the good stuff from the orig. Source lost pistols for all characters and lost the carbine as a primary and they lost the bayonettes. Not only that but the game play that was in it has been reduced to nothing. Some of the great maps are no longer around.Valve has killed this game.
2,Performed by the Starlite Singers,"It says on the back of the CD box, "" Performed by the Starlite Singers "" .....This is not the original artists singing these songs......Not a bad job, some are very convincing, however, they are not original....Still, an ok collections of songs, if you just want to hear some 80's stuff....."
4,buy it and get the songs in the right order,"Guys, it's not that the songs are mixed up but look at the cover! It's the UK version (US version had a black cover and different layout of the band members' heads). So this is the proper song order the way the band intended it and as the album was originally released in their home country at the time. Plus they toss in the songs that were on the US version, too, so this is a great deal. Getting the killer Blacks/Radio alone (which those of us in the vinyl era had to fork over and buy the same album only the UK import) is worth it alone."
4,Good dark music,"I must confess: I bought this CD 'cause it was on sale. I listened it and I liked it. Once at home, my first impression was even better. They sound like The Cure at its best! Considering that this is an old work, they did a very good job. imagine dark music in the 80's, when the kind of music listened at this moment was completely different. I like this Cd very much, is one of my favourites."
3,that voice!!!,"I never liked Richard Butler's vocals I think they are to raspy like he has a bad cold all the time or something. However I can not deny that this is a solid alternative rock album SISTER EUROPE and SUSANS STRANGE are actually alright. Maybe he is an aquired taste for me it was more so the rest of the bands playing I liked more, Butler came second. I will be fair and say its worth getting."
2,what does it fit?,"I love the aluminum can coozie by Thermos, so I bought one of these paper cup coozies as well. I'm sure it fits some cups, just not any that I use. I would prefer to simple use a thermos travel mug. Thermos makes some fantastic travel mugs.This thing is gathering dust on top of my fridge."
2,Tough plant to grow,"I've tried to grow 2 of these plants now with the same results, immediatly, both times.The exotic, interesting plant arrived crushed to begin with, but within 2 weeks it was dried up.After the first dried up, I did some research to make sure I was caring for it properly.I've never had plants that I could not keep alive..let alone for 2 weeks.If you get one...good luck!!!"
4,One of the best sci-fi works of the 70s,"I was reminded of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" when I saw a preview of ""Matrix"". The idea of an unreal reality is very close to the Hindu and Buddhist concept of the universe as maya, illusion; and perhaps also close to the Aboriginal idea of Dreamtime. I consider this book one of the best sci-fi books of recent times, and the film, although lacking in star value, is among the better sci-fi flicks in years, although not in the same league as ""2001"", ""Blade Runner"" or ""Brazil"""
4,Pragmatical solipsism?,"A book with many interesting ideas. Should be required reading for psychiatrists and others in the mental health professions (this and Lessing's ""Briefing for a descent into hell"").This book reads well and doesn't drag hopelessly as too many of mrs Le Guin works do (e.g. ""The Left Hand of Darkness""). On the other hand not overly simplistic as in ""The Word for World is Forest"". All in all an intriguing book."
4,quirky and refreshing,"I really liked the book. It was interesting and different, and Haber and Orr were awesome characters. The end was a little too confusing and preachy, though."
4,You would never believe...,"that this product is cool and all but it is not compatible with Kodak Easyshare C875 such a bummer. Why you ask, well technical support says the Kodak EasyShare C875 cannot sustain such a big memory card and only holds up to 2GB, so I had to return it, and got my refund which by the way was only 80% of it and I bought a Sandisk 2GB (which works very well for my camera). So if your gonna buy this make sure it's compatible with your camera."
1,Disappointed by a DOA Chip,"I purchased one of these 4GB chips and it arrived after almost a week of waiting, DOA. I am disappointed, but ""stuff"" happens. I don't know if it's a quality issue or just one bad chip. I tried it in my camera and 2 computers and it wouldn't work in any of my equipment."
5,Awesome price for 4 gb of memory,Love the huge storage for my camera. I had no problems with it at all.Update on 4/28/12: It's been almost four years and this card keeps going.
1,Did not work,"Both Kingston 4GB SD Cards I bought did not work in my camcorder (Canon Elura 100), my Palm Pilot (Zire 31), or the reader on board my notebook computer (LG F1 Express Dual). I wasted some time trying to make them work, and then fell back on my old adage - ""If I can't make it work within two hours, it ain't designed right. Go back and buy something that is."" Of course, the literature that came with the devices said not all SD cards will work with them, but ALL technology says that. And, sure, Kingston could try to test every device and publish a list of compatible hardware, but there are probably way too many possible combinations to make that feasible. It is left up to us poor consumers to do the testing. Kind of like furniture and bicycle manufacturers relying on us consumers to do all their final assembly and quality control. Slick on their parts."
4,It's an SD memory card,Not sure what else to say about it. It does what it is supposed to do and stores data.
3,Warning.....can't be read by card readers.,"This is a fine card...as far as price and capacity. I bought the 4 gb for a trip to Europe. I took about 200 pictures on it at highest quality of 7.1 megapixels with my Canon SD1000, and still had room to spare. It was great to have so much space and not worry about running out. However, when I got home and tried to use in my HP L7680 printer's media card slots, I got an error message. I tried the card in a Canon MP830 as well, and it would not read there either. So, I had to hook the camera to my PC (the old-fashioned way) and transfer the photos in order to print them. Very annoying, and if I had it to do over, I'd have spent more money to get a card that modern printers can read."
1,Poor Quality,"I was extremely disappointed with the poor quality (made in China) of the cabinet that I received and wound up returning it. The paint coverage was not very thorough, nicks were present in both wood parts and the glass in the door, and the cabinet looked cheap and shoddy overall."
1,Wish dimensions had been given,"Assumed that it fit all TomTom Ones. However, its way too small for the One XL. So I basically wasted my money on case. Wish dimensions had been given or the units that fit into case had been listed."
3,Wrong color,"The strap is difficult to connect and the case should be a different color, it was only available in black."
4,Just what I needed for my great new TomTom navigator,This product was just as advertised and it fits my TomTom perfectly. It offers the protection I needed for storing my TomTom while not in use.
2,Not well made.,"Shoddy workmanship. Zipper misaligned. Tight fit(now that may be good for SOME things, but not this). I bought this on 10/29/07 - on 11/5/07 it was $2.00 less."
3,Great stockings but pricey.,I love the feel and quality of this pair of mens socks. I would buy more but they just cost to much.
4,Great theology book,"This book is very well researched and written, with points that are well-defended from scripture. As other reviewers have noted, however, Grudem does have some opinions which he pushes a little bit too strongly for a textbook-style book."
5,Thorough but understandable,This is an excellent Systematic Theology written in a manner the non-scholar can benefit and enjoy. This is much needed today to make systematic theology approachable and understandable to all.
5,loved it!,This is an essential item for the library of every Christian today. I'm very glad that I purchased my copy from amazon.
3,Ehhh.. I it is ok..,"I received this book as a wedding present two years ago. As I dug in and around the book for different teachings, I grew confused. On several topics Grudem often fails to disprove opposing viewpoints. He almost made me a believer that Jeus went to hell for 3 days after his crucifixion.. And he was making an argument AGAINST it.There is some good material in this book, but his defenses are weak at best.."
1,I was very disappointed in the book.,"Grudem's Systematic Theology is current and mentions contemorary names such as Bill Clinton, John Wimber, etc. There are too many problems to list in a brief review such as this. My main concern is that he is anti-dispensational, believes in the special creation of the soul at conception, espouses a strong Calvinistic position and leans heavily into Charismaticism. There are many more problems, but these are my main concerns. For those looking for a good biblical theology, go through Grudem carefully with both eyes open."
4,Solid work,"Ok, I am not an expert theologian. But here are my 2 cents. This is a sound and well written work. I am not in agreement with all his views, specially about the Holy Spirit gifts (I am a cessacionist), but this does not deny that the book is extremely valuable, and shows a great amount of scholarship and biblical basis. The devotional section at the end of each chapter is a nice detail."
3,Pretty good......smaller version is better,"The tea tumbler (which I also use for coffee) is a better value, and holds heat longer. If you must have a larger version, fill with boiling water for 5 minutes."
3,Illustrations too small,"I found this manual very useful. It is well organized and explains very well. However, I have to use a magnifying glass to view the illustrations of screen shots. They were too small."
1,Dumb design,"Cheaply designed, surprised it got that much rating. The metal doesn't make it sturdier, just heavier. It's structurally flimsy, not worth 36 dollars. I rather go with sturdier lighter plastic,but less functionality design."
3,Eh - It's okay,"The only problem I had with this is that both of my 65 lb dogs can fit through the 'cat door' if they really want to! They are considered large dogs, do therefore they should not be able to fit through the 'small' pet door.Other than that it's fine."
4,Works great,Love the gate. It works perfectly to keep my dog out of the areas i don't want him in. Also like that i don't have to put holes in my door frame to use it.
