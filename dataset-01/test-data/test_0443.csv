5,Great!,"These are the first solar lights I have had that will actually stay on ALL night. Very clean look as the silver cylinder base sits directly at grass level when placed on the aluminum base peg. Very ""natural"" light. Not too bright and definetly these are best lining a driveway or walkway, etc, or as accent lighting for flower bends or whatever you need to light."
3,A decent effort.,"Many of the songs fit in well with the orchestra and I am not too annoyed by the lyrics which have been awful for so damn long I don't know where to begin. Probably the best thing they have done since an 80s release and just because those were somewhat catchy if not totally 80s. I don't know, this album doesn't have any of the ridiculous keyboards that basically killed some of their later albums and the singing isn't as bad as it was on The Ladder. Some songs on that release had some seriously cheesy lyrics. In fact, when Yes gets out of hand they make it their business to write awful lyrics. This one is a bit better but still has some of that weirdness. Anyway, it's better arranged as a whole than anything they did since the 80s bar a song or two or maybe some of the Keys."
4,Magnification... though not magnifying enough,"I believe that this last studio album so far of Yes is rather good... but not good enough to earn 5 stars. I am a huge Yes fan and I've been grading their work rather mildly so far... This record has some very nice songs on it as Magnification, Give Love Each Day and Times... the orchestra is implanted into the band very nice, there is no such a feeling that the orchestra overbalances the band itself as it was in the good times of Time and a Word... though as some mention, for worshipers of Steve Howe this album probably won't be too good, for there is not much guitar here, more orchestra... Actually, if it is still the last studio album of Yes, it's a pity, because they still could create something wonderful... definitely listen to it... it is much better than Open Your Eyes or The Ladder, so it is worth it."
2,No way,"Here and there you might find a glimpse of their magic, but certainly this record points toward the fact that, oddly enough, these great musicians, instead of evolving and maturing (thus able to create awesome music) simply are out of gas. Keyboards are a must in Yes. Bring back the Russian fellow, even the tormented soul we call Rick Wakeman would do. I suspect we have seen the last of them in the studio. This is sad."
1,I didnt like them at all,I bought the bottles and when I used them all the milk came out and get all the baby wet
5,The BEST Bottles!!,"I spent alot of money trying out new bottles with various different nipples sizes. These are by far the best bottles on the market. I have read the feeback other people left about the bottles leaking and extra cleaning parts, but the bottles perform really well. I have never had a leaking issue with them and cleaning is not a big deal considering what the product delivers. The bottle helps reduce the air and gasiness babies get from regular feeding bottles including the over-rated Playtex drop ins. The Drop ins are too costly and still get air inside them if you set the bottle down."
2,More Energy?,I purchased the product because I wanted to increase my energy leval.I was always falling to sleep in the front of the TV. I have been usingthe product for over a month now and I still haven't received thatboost in power I wanted. I will continue to use the product but don'texpect overnight results.
1,Did not rceive,"The above requested book was never received as of this date. I did receive the vegetable book, ordered at the same time, which I enjoy. Please inform me if the Seafood book is available, if not please refund any moneys you may owe me. Tx for your attention, Jurgen Moritz"
4,Door handle,"Exactly what was needed, fit truck door perfectly. No problems at all. Will use company again for car parts or if some other factory part needs replacement."
3,BRIGHT ORANGE TIE,This tie is so bright orange that you need to wear sunglasses when looking at it. If you are Tennessee Volunteer fan then this is the perfect tie for game day. It is well constructed.
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!!!!!!,"What can I say bad about this honey? Nothing!!! I even wonder if it's just raw honey at all! It is very thick, sweet, and creamy! I only use it for tea but when I did my YouTube review I tasted it and boy why did I do that????? It is YUMMY!! Check out my YouTube review to get my full opinion and reaction! [...]"
4,Good product,Enjoy the taste of this honey and the product itself. Only downfall for me is that it's a solid and when i'm cooking I need it to be a liquid and it takes a bit to liquify for me.
2,"Excited by the dust jacket write-up, disappointed in the book","I was excited about reading this book when I read the write-upon the dust jacket. It sounded like something I would really like.It started out well with the story of Katla, a thrall (or slave) onher way to Greenland in A.D. 985. I enjoyed the description ofevery day life for the new settlers. The conflict between theworshippers of the old Norse Gods and the new Christians wasinteresting.But ... I didn't like any of the characters. I had troublefollowing what was going on. The narration is in first person,split between the voices of Katla, her daughter Bibrau, andThorbjorg, the seeress/healer. I often had to go back and rereadentire sections to get the flow of the story - especially whenthe narration was in Bibrau's voice."
4,Satanic Death Metal The Way It Should Be Played,"The best brutal-death release in some while, enjoy it"
1,A complete scam,"This is something I could have done myself, at home, without buying it or paying any shipping. You basically use a 2 litter soda bottle, an air pump, and add water with shrimp eggs. If you order this, they provide a stand. FYI: I would get the same results without their stand and using a glass vase -vs- a plastic soda bottle."
1,40 hours and few only a have hatched.,"The directions say to use water with over 8 PH, I used RO water and raised it to 9 PH. It said to keep the eggs between 80 and 82 DEG F, my heater was set at 81 DEG F and checked with a thermometer. It says the eggs will hatch in 24 to 36 hours, it has been 40 hours and only a few eggs have hatched. I would say less than .5% have hatched. People are getting better results with a cheep Sea Monkey kit."
2,Not for Kindle,"This is the second script I purchased for my Kindle. If I had waited to purchase it instead of buying it at the same time as the other play (Noises Off) I bought, I would not have gotten this. Kindle is not good to use for stage scripts. Scenes you want to review are very hard to find quickly. While I love the show of The Fantastiks, I do not recommend buying it on Kindle."
3,Small,"I did not pay attention to the size of this cup as it is just that, one cup.I bought it for a basset hound puppy and it will work for a short time only. Don't get me wrong, it is a very nice cup and fits the carrier nicely but will probably work better for a smaller dog or cat."
4,Almost perfect underground rock.,"THE Revealing Science of God is a great song with a great riff within the first 2 minutes of it, it should have been a hit.The Remembering is the only weak song. The Ancient is another good song with amazing work by Steve Howe.Ritual also has great guitar by Steve Howe also."
5,BORING???!!,"Im not gonna make this long. This is my favorite Yes album by far and one of my favorite albums ever. All the songs are absolutely stunning and beautiful. There's not one second that is out of place or dragged on in my opinion at least. Some of Yes' best work. I dont understand why some people are bashing it so much here. This is a truly amazing peice of work and it deserves just as much (if not more) credit than Close to the Edge, Relayer, or Fragile. Way more than Fragile actually. Dont get me wrong, those albums are phenominal. But this album just puts all of those to shame. With CTTE in a close second. But again, this is just my opinion. It has everything that i love in Yes and in prog rock in general. It's just great."
3,Editing needed,"This 81 minute double album could easily have been edited down to one 45 minute album which would have been a more worthy follow up to the stellar Close to the Edge. Great moments but way too much filler (like almost all of track 3). Still worth having, especially the remastered edition."
2,"Only ""Yes people"" ...","... can find this to be ""philosophical"" or deep in any way. Musically decent, as one should expect from musicians of this caliber, but often disoriented and strained to create long pieces, since, presumably, long means ""complex,"" ""artistic"" and ""serious."" Yeah, right. The irritating, screeching Anderson's voice disturbs as always, but is fortunately not too present, with all the showing off Wakeman and Howe try to pull off. The lyrics are retarded as one is used to get from Yes, not that they deserve any attention. Still, this has the air of naivete and wanna-be artistry that the band would later abandon for pure unadulterated greed and commercialism, starting around the truly disastrous Tormato and on.Two stars - one deserved, for any Yes album, another for the reduction in Anderson's participation."
3,Doesn't Gel,"I can hear that they are trying to do the same basic things that they did on ""Close to the Edge"", though here they are trying to weld musical fragments together into not one but four side-long pieces. Some of the musical themes and fragments here are of a high quality level - brilliant, I'd say.But stretching them out over this much space, interspersed with musical silliness (drum solos, acoustic guitar soling, and that pseudo-ethnic stuff on Side 3), and organizing it around mystical/spiritual nonsense did not serve the band well. Their ambition got the better of them. They went from dense to diffuse.I accept Bill Bruford's assessment of the band circa this time frame, as he says in his autobiography - to some extent, in some way, their luck came together on ""Close to the Edge"", and presumably that luck didn't hold up here. Had they lowered their sights they could probably have turned this into a fine piece or two."
2,practically unlistenable,"me too, i've been listening to this great band since about 1970. i even saw them open for elp in philadelphia. they were amazing!! recently, i've been picking up their remastered material and have been thrilled to rediscover them, at least up until i relistened to tales... now i remember why i pretty much lost interest in them after this album, with the exception of relayer. i never thought i'd agree with the critics of prog rock, having always loved it; from early yes to early genesis, to caravan, etc. i'm disappointed to say, but this album is practically unlistenable. sorry, guys."
5,"Yes's masterpiece, without a doubt","I'm too tired right now to expound at length on the reasons why I love this album so dearly. Suffice it to say that it is, in my opinion, the culmination of their collaborative creative genius.I love almost everything Yes created in the 70's, but if I could only take one Yes album with me to a desert island, it would have to be ""Topographic Oceans"". ""Close to the Edge"" and ""Going For The One"" would be close, and it would be hard not to have ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"" or ""Relayer"" with me, but this one is Yes going all the way with their vision. All the way."
4,Yes! avant-garde Yes!,"If you want Yes to be a rock band, I think you'll be disappointed by their very souls. This is not rock music. This is music. The scores for the pieces on this album, 4 20-minute giants, were writeen in 6 hours in one night from about 1AM to 7AM, & they revised them over the next few months. A lot of the music here is sort of ambient, slow, & with some weird drumming & other things too you never know where it'll take itself from anywhere. There are all kinds of different musical experiments here, & I don't think any of them have any desire to resemble rock. This is the Yes album you want for the mystical uniqueness of the music."
3,Tales of mystery gone astray...,"Trippy lyrics (I keep coming back to it) tend to make one trip in the end. As a period piece OK; the music is still up to standards, but on the whole it sounds too much like they had a plan: Let's make a double with only 4 songs! Yeah, great! You know what? Let's make these songs refer to each other, to make it a suite, or one song actually. OK, let's go!Rick Wakeman was right in ordering pizzas onstage during live performances of this one. Yes, good music CAN go over the top!"
2,Prog Rock Disaster,"Sorry I know that some people are really into this album but I just didn't get it. While Tangerine Dream abandoned the concept of rock and just had fun making weird synth sounds, Yes and ELP not only wanted to retain the status of rock musicians, they promoted of the idea of the ""concept album"" a dreadful idea that almost killed rock. Tales from Topographic Ocean is too meandering to pass as rock but yet annoying enough that it can't quietly filed under ambient. If you see this in your parent's lp collection, don't ask. You don't want to know."
5,The Ultimate Musical Journey,"The music of Tales From Topographical Oceans requires one to have open ears and an open mind. This isn't a ""rock album"" by any means - It's a musical journey, a LONG musical journey.Yes created these 4 compositions to tell a story, but it is my opinion that they also meant for them to be heard, felt and experienced for what they are, even if they're not easily understood. I truly enjoy this music. I can sit back and absorb it and let it take me somewhere else. Some may love it, some may hate it, but then Progressive music has always been an acquired taste. But if you're somewhat compelled, Buy this, open your ears, open your mind and enjoy the music."
4,Tales,The Ancient opens with a beautifully dense 8 minute section which makes this album essential for any Yes fan. I enjoy Jon Anderson's vocals but don't really listen to the words. Steve Howe's guitar work is imaginative and intense. I like parts of all 4 songs but not all of any; yet I have enjoyed this album for 25 years and probably will for 50 more.
5,amazing,I have 4 gb of this Corsair memories (4 x 1 GB) installed in my ASUS motherboard and having excellent results.
2,Corsair Memory,"Received product. Two sticks of 1GB memory. One worked excellently while the other was a total ""dud"". Never worked. I complained to Amazon and they forwarded it to the seller. No feed back whatever. So I lost 1GB of an otherwise excellent product."
1,2 or 4 sticks bad,"I ordered two of these, for a total of four sticks. One stick from each was bad, leading to failures in Memtest. I've used Corsair memory before and have not had problems, but this batch or version is pretty bad.Product ID is CM2X1024-6400C5, 2.10V ver 2.1"
4,performance off the charts!,"flawless operation on Intel extreme motherboard. recognized as 800 5-5-5-12, not sure about pushing them, i don't over-clock things just for fun like some of these whacko hardware freaks. i have better things to do with my computer than tweak my cpu and memory frequencies and run performance tests so i can see how fast my computer 'would' run, if i actually did some work on it... they run rather hot, not warm, but hot. doesn't seem to affect their performance. they scored 5.5 on Vista Ultimate performance index."
1,Useless will not run on Mac OS !,"What a waste of money! Will not run on OS 10.4 or 10.5, customer service and website could not help me. Runs for 5 minutes and gets slower and slower and slower and then freezes. I have more than the recommended minimum requirements! Do not buy if you plan on running it on a Mac."
1,"Don't buy, Very hard to install.",The game's default resolution was not set to fit on a wide screen so after booting my screen would turn off. After searching the internet for an hour I found out that if you hold down the ctrl or alt button (i forgot which one) while booting a menu will appear allowing you to choose your screen resolution or put the game in window mode. Why wasn't this included in the manual? As a customer I shouldn't have to search for answers on the internet.After I was able to get the game to start it ran so slow that it wasnt playable. My mac's specs are way over the game requirments. I'm sure there is a fix somewhere on the internet for this as well but I've had enough. I'll just go back to playing civ4 for mac (which I highly recommend!)Civilization 4: Gold Edition
1,This book is terrible...,"While it might have all the necessary information, it presents it in a way that you'll never remember any of it. Also, the review questions at the end of every chapter were not helpful as well. They questioned you on questions not answered in the review of the chapter. Furthermore, the AP Review for Environmental Science was longer than my text book. It was a waste of money."
2,alittle better than first one,"authors view of women is also very disturbing in the past book.""The Lost Books of Merlyn"" makes up for this one by being more historically accurate, however still biased and there are better book on druidism.Better than his first but not worth time buying it.I will not recommend this book because it still has questionable resources."
5,an eye opener of a book,"This book has helped me understand the practice of druidism, it made me understand that there is more to life then the bible and that its not the only way to live, that there is more to choose from to go with whats in your heart rather then whats popular at the moment, it makes u think about what is possible."
1,please don't buy this tripe,"Doug Monroe combines ignorance about Celtic lore and Druidism with ignorance about occultism and the practice of magic. Together, they produce books which are at best foolish, and sometimes actively dangerous. Don't bother."
1,eh don't know if you want to waste money like that,i know in my first review i totally complimented this book but closer examination of this and the 21 lessons of merlyn my god what was i thinking both books contian stuff that is complete list of lies i found one or two things usful but if your truly looking for druidry then don't get this book
5,Finally!,Finally an easy to follow book to help give my mind some peace and quiet! Love this book so much I also bought it as an audiobook to listen to in the car.
1,Cognitive therapy-don't believe the hype,"I actually have been to Robert Leahy's center-the American Center for Cognitive Therapy- a let me tell you that it was the biggest waste of money in my life. Arrogant, simplistic therapist who wouldn't even let you talk. CBT is a breezy, pie in the sky treatment not up to snuff to the challenges of an even unperturbed existence. [...]"
3,Not Good For General Worry,"This book is good if you worry about your finances or not being able to find a relationship. Most of the book focuses on those two scenarios. It has a few good suggestions but relies a lot (as so many self-help books do) on the cognitive therapies in the book ""Feeling Good""."
2,Wrong size for the pail,I ordered what I thought was the correct size for my 1.5 Gal compost pail but received filters that were far too small for the lid. The problem is that there is no size on the packaging and I think the seller sent the wrong item. I still had the box that my compost pail came in so I knew the size of the pail. The filters are not described well online so you don't really know what you are getting.
3,compost filters,"I thought I was getting 2 filters to fit my countertop composter (which is round). What I rec'd was a round filter that is a little small for my unit, and a square filter that doesn't go anywhere...."
1,A school counselor in Mississippi,"I purchased this book with intentions of using it for classroom guidance. However, Sophie's running alone into the woods to vent her anger is too troubling to me. Teaching our children to leave anger-provoking situations is important, but this is not the appropriate example. I can't present my students with a book that demonstrates potentially dangerous behavior to them."
1,When Sophie gets angry...she runs away!,"This is NOT a good book to teach kids how to handle anger. It is NOT a good idea to TEACH KIDS TO RUN AWAY from their anger and situation. This is not based on good psychology.Small children are very literal, and they are not going to get any other message from this book other than to run away. This book was not well researched, and I cannot believe it won any awards, much less a Caldecott.As a physician and a mother, I must give this 2 thumbs down."
4,Appropriate as a story about anger,"I think this story is a beautiful visual and emotional representation of anger. To the readers who think a book will teach a small child to scream and run away, that is ludicrous! The idea is to discuss stories you read with our child. This child removes herself from the situation, does not hit her sister, does not throw herself on the floor, and uses physical activity and nature to calm herself. We should all be so controlled.Other people mentioned that this is an awful book because Sophie appears spoiled and doesn't tell her mother that she left. These are the same people who hate the Carl the Dog books because they feel that people will start leaving their children with labradors as babysitters. Ha! Stories teach you something whether they are real-life, fantasy, appropriate actions or inappropraite. They open communication and this particular book lets small children understand that anger is a valid emotion and can be recovered from and life goes on!"
2,disappointed,I had to read this book to a class of KG children for a University class project on dealing with anger. I was the only one who thought the idea of running and running away was not something we should be encouraging small children to do. I asked my KG kids what they thought of the Mom's attitude and they all agreed she should not have taken sides with the sibling. We also discussed Sophie running and decided it was OK for her because (presumably) she was in her own garden and that it would not be safe to just run away if you lived in a city or an apartment. Surprised it got the awards!
2,Do not read this book to your child!!!,"This book suggests to your child that when she is angry, she should run out of the house and run and run and run and hide in a tree until she isn't angry anymore. Am I the only one who sees a problem with this? I don't see this as a viable option for most families."
4,kate's best album ever,"Kate Bush is an artist who is known for her spectacular talent but who isn't known for her consistency. I definitely consider myself a fan of Kate's music, but admittadly, her catalogue is hit or miss. Albums that are released years apart from eachother that contain songs that are either REALLY amazing or REALLY mediocre...luckily, The Dreaming is an album that is consistently awesome with every track. Though this LP is Kate at the peak of her lyrical and musical eccentricity, everything here works. Songs range from bright pop pieces (""Sat in your Lap"", ""Suspended in Gaffa"", ""Get out of my House"") to dark, emotive modern torch numbers (""Pull out the Pin"", ""Night of the Swallow, ""Houdini"")...everything here is memorable though and because she pioneered the vague abstract pixie lyricism that artists like Tori Amos and Bjork would later adopt, her words (and the way she sings them) become thought provoking long after the disc stops playing."
5,GET IT! GET IT! GET IT! GET IT!,"This is absolutely genius and no other way to describe it. All the songs are so captivating and blend into each other so well. Although all the songs are great and you need to listen to them all together without skipping, my faves are 'Suspended in Gaffa', 'Dreaming', 'Night of the swallow' and 'Get out of my house'. 'Night of the swallow' is especially the best IMO it is so addictive and a great example of Kates genius, i cant imagine anyone else making that without it sounding like a jumble of mess! Play it loud and REALLY listen to it and you will fall in love!!"
4,Another great album for KATE BUSH,"It's a great album,but not her best. But if you are abig fan of her I think you should have this album,and you must know that It's not better than (the kick inside)&(hounds of love)."
3,expected more,"Love David Foster but I think he should have been more involved with this project...too many slow songs...Kenny's singing is, as usual, very Kenny & A+ , but I was overall disappointed in the record..."
2,JBL customer service.,I found the headphones to be quite nice until they stopped working. Apparently JBL makes no attempt at customer service for low cost items. In fact They are not even listed or mentioned in their catalogs and leave no contact information. This was my last JBL purchase. There are many high quality Audio manufactures out there. I have never written a bad review but forewarned is forearmed.
3,Entertaining sea story,"Published in the USA as ""Sea Devil"" in 1979. George Gurney was an up-and-coming British junior naval officer when he began courting Lady Arabella Mountolivet. That interfered with the schemes of her guardian, Mathias Ortway, who arranged for George to appear to be cheating at cards. That leads to a mission of revenge from England to the Orient and back. All in all, it's a pretty good story."
2,Usable,"Appears to be more of a 'plastic'. I'm sure it will last this season, but believe the Honda bags are a better quality."
1,"Really? I mean, really?","I watched this on a cross-Atlantic flight. I thought, nowhere to go, nothing to do, may be entertaining. I watched until Mr. Black peed on the castle. Then I decided that i would be much more entertaining to watch the flight map, read the tax free brochure six times and draw smiley faces on the customs declaration.What were they thinking?Horrible."
2,Amazon is idiotic,"It appears that the computer system at amazon is dumb. When I live in Australia but amazon sends me discs regularly that are not for my region, you would have to say ""useless service"" I will NEVER use this service again"
3,Things that shouldn't be in a PG movie,"OK up front sorry about the grammar. I didn't see this in the theater. Cause remakes of movies for the most part are not good. Taking a great story and turning it into crap. Is something Hollywood likes to do, but shouldn't. How this movie ever got a PG rating was beyond me. This movie is targeted for kids. But misses the mark by a mile. PG movies target for younger kids. Should never show the backside of a person. Nor should the use of urination as a means to get a laugh. Finally it's clear that the film makers are liberal in their beliefs. To indoctrinate that war isn't or is a good thing. Is something that should not be in a movie targeted for younger children. Simply put, the film makers took a fine piece of artistic work, and turned it into crap with their re-make."
1,Cannot Skip Trailers on DVD,"I rented this DVD and was appalled when I could not fast forward through any of the commercials or movie trailers before the movie! It may be different on other blu-ray/DVD players, but on my Playstation 3 I could not skip to the main menu or skip/fast forward through any of the trailers. If you plan to get this DVD, expect to wait through ten minutes of commercials every time you want to watch the film."
1,A very lame movie,"I never write reviews but I have to say this is a really lame movie. I loved Gulliver's travel's as book and I appreciate that you need to change the story, to give it modern spin so audiences of today can relate to it. But this movie was just lame. There are good light hearted movies and Jack Black's shenanigans can be hilarious in a proper context but this was neither. Do not waste your time watching this movie."
2,Save your money!!!,Dont bother to buy Blu-ray or DVD. Dont even rent. If you can get a free copy from your friend may be.its an awful movie. Disgrace to the original novel.
2,Ouch !.... this movie causes a little pain.,"I like what Jack Black brought to the movies...but in this movies, i did 'nt wantwhat Jack Black offered, cause ive seen it all before done better. So all hislittle jokes and dancing and whatever falls very flat in this movie, its almostembarassing. I like Jack, i wish him better luck on his next movie, because one more movie like this, his name will have to change to Jack Crap.Not a keeper... its a look once ...never go back"
2,Yuck!,"Just a quick comment. Went to see this with my son and girlfriend because we had to beout of the house between 1 and 3 for the cleaners. Well there was only one movie that wastimed perfectly for us. Unfortunately it was this bomb.I normally like Jack Black, but in this terribly written and played out bomb, there wasn'tmuch he could do. This will probably be the worst movie I see this year and it's only January.My girlfriend and son, who is fourteen, also agree."
2,One big cliche,"How could this movie go so wrong?It has a nice cast, headed by Jack Black, who can carry a movie with humor and charm under certain circumstances. It is sumptuously photographed with wonderful special effects and rich colors.It also has a miserably cliched story further dragged down by obviously intentionally wooden acting. For some reason the ""creative forces"" behind the movie thought that the wooden acting was some sort of comedic tour de force. The truth is that it is just wooden acting.Jack Black is charming and funny when he's not TRYING to be charming and funny. Here he is trying very hard to be charming and funny, with predictably miserable results.There are a few bits here and there which could have been really funny. Intellectually I could see the potential humor. However, they are completely mismanaged and dry as presented in this film. It is all a very sad waste."
5,"If you want to build a strip canoe, you need this book!","Clear, and to the point. Gilpatrick made it very simple and realistic. Tells you what you need to know without getting too crazy with information. The book shows how much experience Gilpatrick has with what he does. The plans were fantastic. Great job!"
2,Too bulky,"I was really excited about this product until I actually wore it. The fabric in the crotch part (that gives support) is too bulky and rubs against the inside of my legs. It was more annoying that the actual pain of the vulvar varicosities. I was relieved when I actually took the product off. It does help the pressure down there, but I just couldn't stand the way it fit. I tried to readjust it, but nothing changed the fact it was too bulky. I had to send it back."
4,"Dink, Scat, Crusty and the gang",A great kids film! Highly enjoyable and entertaining for adults and kids. It is also a great Xmas gift!
5,great followup to Metaplanetary!,"Superluminal is the sequel to the wonderful Metaplanetary, and it rocks as well! Set in an interconnected solar sytem in the far future, it tells of the war which will determine the form (or forms) humans will wear when they reach out to the stars...intelligent space opera with lot of heart... :)"
5,Great album!,Yesterdays is another classic by Yes.Gorgeous! Absolutelt one of the best Yes albums and one of the best progressive rock albums ever released.A must to all progressive rock lovers and collectors.
2,Yes Looks Back,"Yesterdays is a compilation of songs made up from the band's first two albums, Yes and Time & A Word. Those first two albums went virtually unnoticed in the US before the band hit the mainstream with their third release, The Yes Album. One of the reasons the first two albums failed is that they are not very good. The band is still trying to find its footing and the lineup wasn't set. The band was in between albums when they released the album in 1974 and most people were unaware of their first two releases. The only real bright spot is their version of Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" which was recorded in 1972 with the classic Yes lineup. It is a fabulous interpretation of the song and a highlight from the band."
1,lightweight,Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product. I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging.
3,Good for small jobs,"I would only recommend using this for the odd small job. The silicone is easy to works with, but is not outstanding in preventing mold. After about 1 year, it seems to be pealing off in some areas."
2,GREAT BAG - BAD - Handles -,Pros-*Lots of room for everything you need*Protective of your Laptop/PC*Well designed with compartments with everything you needCons-*Handles breaks after a year - had two of these bags handle breaks in same spot.Over all-This is a good bag over all I had two of these bags and had the same problem twice I would not have purchased this bag again but I have looked for something else with the same quality and for the price there is nothing out there that has the design and the features that this one does well I have not found anything else that bets it and I'm still looking and might buy it again because I like the features and compartments that the bag has.
2,disappointing,"After a huge debut, and then the comeback of the year with the mighty Slave to the Grind, Skid Row's third effort, Subhuman Race, is a big let down. It has it's moments (Into Another and Breakin' Down) but is very disappointing for the most part. Every time I hear the chorus to Beat Yourself Blind, I cringe."
2,Not what's shown or described,"I just received this item. The picture shows three Wire Cup Brushes in three distinctly different sizes. The description reads ""Wilmar W1214c 3 Cup Wire Brush"". Who would have thought that you only receive one 3"" diameter Wire Cup Brush? Price was right so I'm not too disappointed, but I just wanted to let others know before purchasing this what they will be receiving. Seller should change both the picture and Item Description because they are both currently deceptive."
2,Not advanced,"The title is deceiving: advanced is a stretch for the content. If you already have some experience using Javascript, consider another title that doesn't just cover the basics as this book does."
4,GREAT HEAVY FAN...ALOT OF POWER,THIS FAN WILL TAKE YOU BACK IN TIME WHEN THINGS WERE BUILT GOOD AND SOLID... AWSOME FAN... ALOT OF POWER...GREAT PRICE. CENTER CHROME PIECE A LITTLE OFF AS MENTIONED IN SOME ABOVE POSTS. WOULD DEF. RECOMEND THIS FAN
4,Hit after Hit,I love this CD! It haves the #1 hits of each artist. Music sounds good I would have rated it ***** but the music on 2 of Sade's songs could have been better.
4,Nice costume; great quality for the price,"This is a quality costume, especially for the money. I returned a more expensive, cheaper quality, costume and purchased this one as a replacement. The costume lived up to the positive reviews."
5,Great local disc,An extremely hard to find local Nashville rap disc that is great if you knew it when it was new (and maybe even if you didn't) brought back some great memories and a great add to my collection.
3,"Nice Try, But it still doesn't beat the real thing","I think it is great that the artists paid a tribute to Led Zeppelin. (Probably the best rock band ever). I like the Stone Temple Pilots, Dancing days. But if you're a LZ Fanatic (Like me) you'll know that the original albums are still the best. Buy the originals to experience LZ."
2,Not for the LZ purist,"If you are a Zeppelin purist, this album is not for you. For example, Sheryl Crow is not well-suited to sing Dyer Maker. This is clearly an unwanted product of the Page/Plant reunion. Maybe worth your time if you haven't heard the original cuts."
5,Good listening!,"I purchased this one because there were several songs from Larry Gatlin's first LP, ""The Heart"". The lyrics and his vocals reached down into my soul as I listened over and over to the LP. Don't know why that particular record has not been released in CD format. The beautiful songs have stood the test of time."
3,Good but not bright.,I know that rope lights are not support to be bright or put out any sort of light but these are very dark. I used them as back lighting for cabinets and they are hardly noticeable even with the lights off.
1,"Could have been a great scale, but NOT!","The good:1-large platform,2-large, easy to read digits3-grams or 1/10 oz scale4-very accurate and consistent (unlike many digital scales)5-easy tare zeroing6-11 lb capacity7-auto shut off (BUT SEE BELOW)The bad:1-uses hard to find, expensive lithium coin battery2-auto shut off. Tends to turn of much too quickly. This can be a problem especially if you zero tare, add material, and then it shuts off!If the auto shutoff will not trouble you, then this is a very nice scale. But be aware.UPDATE: That auto shutoff gets more annoying all the time!UPDATED UPDATE: Changed rating from 3* to 1*. Auto shutoff became erratic and much too fast. Ruined the utility of the scale. If the auto shutoff was reliable and set to much longer (like 3 minutes), it would be a solid 4* item (coin batteries still a problem- they wear out way too fast even with the auto shutoff). As it is, don't buy; check out the Ozeri scales. I got one to replace this piece of junk and so far it's great."
1,Taylor scale fails,"I bought this scale, because of the fact that measures in kg and scales at 1g, which for me is important, but there are vary factors that are really upsetting, it shuts off in the middle of the weighting, so you have to start all over again, specially when you are making your mise en place,So you really have to have everything ready before you even start, second it broke so many times, that even Taylor exchanging for a new one, in more than four times I really gave up in the product, for now I use it as a back up, because if you use it a lot you may have to return it a lot also. No wonder there's a life time warranty.Cheap like all Chinese made products, nothing is made in this country anymore so we get what we pay for, but not what we want. I found OXO scale a good purchase comparing to the cheap Chinese Taylor. I don't even recommend it if you use it daily, a real little junk."
1,Another Regurgitated Pseudo-Scientific Garbage,"This book is absolutely laughable in how it tries to deal with clinical depression. The author's suggestions are akin to the idea that wearing a smiley face on your lapel will make you a happier person. His insistence that humans are somehow ""wired for happiness"" is rather hard to reconcile with the Buddhist principle that ""Life is suffering"", yet that doesn't stop him from shamelessly pushing religion on his readers. If you're an atheist, you apparently don't even count as a person.The positive reviews of this book seem to come from the author himself and his multiple fake accounts, which only furthers undermines his integrity as a serious writer."
5,Anatomical Inferno,Crushing production......Absolute Carcass worship........Highly recommended to fans of Grind-Gore
4,Excellent true story of WWII,Lots of action and suspense. Great flick for any WWII Buff. Also a great move for students on the many aspects of the war.
1,The DVD would NOT play at all.,"I was given the impression I was buying an english subtitled version of this film, that would play in American blu-ray players and it did not play at all! Very dissapointed indeed."
1,Too Much.,"There is too much to wade through in this story -- exaggerated accents, Indian lore, extreme weather conditions, improbable behavior, unlikely relationships, secrets within secrets. Yet the romantic outcome is a foregone conclusion from the start. I wanted to like the book because it is different. But, after picking it up a dozen times only to lose interest each time after a few pages, I finally skipped straight to the last chapter. (I did want to know who committed the murder and why.) I haven't resorted to that in years. Just couldn't get into this story because of all the wierd, unnecessary distractions."
1,Lamp sent is not lamp shown,I was not too impressed with the fact that the lamp pictured and that I ordered because it matched the crib set I have wasn't the lamp that was sent to me. The lamp that was sent to me was from a different blue jean teddy theme in which I have nothing else. I have the noah's ark theme and I wanted the noah's ark lamp.
2,"Kids like it, I don't","I honestly think these books are totally stupid & rude, but my kids like them. The little one likes the music. I would say if your kids haven't discovered Captain Underpants on their own, don't introduce it to them. You'll probably wish you hadn't."
1,Disappointed customer,"I was also disappointed with this highchair for the same above reasons. I don't know how they expect for an infant/toddler to sit in this chair in a functional position to eat. Are the Italian kids giants or what? I have to put a small pillow under her bottom so she can sit tall enough to reach her food while in this chair. I have a Fisher-Price Healthy Care high chair half the price at a relatives home, and it is SO MUCH better in this regard. Also, don't waste your money on the Prima Pappa Rocker. I folded it up one night and it fell over (doesn't stand up well even when leaning against counter), and the seat unit was bent (basically broken and unusable). Anyway, who wants to rock their child when at the table? Don't waste your money. Buy a wooden chair as above or Fisher-Price."
3,Okay But.....,"We needed to replace a pet carrier too small for our current pets.Shipping was fine. Instructions minimal and reduced to tiny pictographs. Fit of parts is tight, the door is difficult to operate one-handed.Less than 2 weeks after assembling a crack has developed on the backside opposite the door.Sigh...It was very pretty for a little while.Hope you all fare better.Two and a half stars."
2,Cat Carrier -- too small,Any critter would be claustrophic in this except the tiniest baby thing. I gave it away and bought a much larger one because the reshipping cost and return mailing would have made it cost prohibitive to return. Waste of money.
5,Really happy,Very happy with price and how quick I received product thank you. Highly recommend buying from this dealer. Tragicaly hip CDs are hard to find or over priced hopefully more from this dealer.
1,A bad imitation of REM,"Never having heard this band, I bought it on recommendation of a friend. They sound a bit like REM, only without the soul. They're just not very good. I thought about throwing the album out, instead I tried giving it away. No one wanted it."
5,Another McToys masterpiece!,"This Box Set is pure gold to the eye.And I'm talking about all the detail,the dinamic and the power residing on Neo and one the Merovigian's vampires.The break-apart action is awesome and makes this an must-have for any Mcfarlanes Toys or Matrix fan.No doubt about it,you must have it!"
5,The Best Oldies R & B I've heard in a long time.,"If you like James Brown, Sam Cooke, Marvin Gaye among others, you will love this c.d. He has a gospel sound with a unique range. This c.d. contains tap your feet songs as well as sit down and listen tunes. The song, You Can Make It If You Try is my favorite. It was the first anthem for Blacks before We Shall Overcome. It's really inspirational. Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,Useless and a waste of money,"I bought this in hopes of improving my singing voice, especially increasing the range of my voice and avoid singing off tune. At the end of using this my voice is no better than it was at the start - in fact it's a bit worse. I'm having a harder time keeping my voice in tune than I did at the start. It actually made my singing worse!"
2,Don't let the cover full you.,"This DVD is for the very beginners. The coaches won't help you to sing like Mariah, Beyonce nor any of the member of Boyz II Men."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"This DVD was terrible. Watching this video will NOT teach you how to sing and you definitely cannot follow along with it to practice. It made me want to cut my ears off. In all my years of singing and taking voice lessons I had no idea that such complete trash was out there!!!! The first ""Vocal Coach"" had people producing incorrect wide mouthed vowels that can not be described as an audible pitch that any human being can endure listening to. The second guy at least knew how to play the piano and was doing vocal exercises. But, his tapping the piano and telling people to ""use your pee muscles"" to sing is NONSENSE. I am shocked that this was ever released!! DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,great service,"This book was exactly as advertised - a beautiful copy of a somewhat hard to find book, dust cover intact, interesting and time - enlivened poems overflowing. Unfortunately, the USPS mangled it in transit. Within 10 hours of clicking the appropriate spot on the website, I got a full refund and a nice note from the seller. I'm a slighly unfortunate - but satisfied - customer!"
4,knifefighter,"This is another fine novel by Wellman generally based on the life of the famous creator of the Bowie knife. Jim Bowie was a larger-than-life character during the turbulent history of the early United States. Wellman wrote well before the advent of 'political correctness' so he pulls no punches in describing the attitudes of the day among those frontier people. Bowie was a slaver, and, like many of his contemporaries, saw nothing particularly wrong with that peculiar institution; nor, was he squeamish about gutting any opponent who challenged him to a fight. Like many men of those times he was tough, ruthless and independent, the sort of men who flocked to Texas during its fight for independence from Mexico. As in Broncho Apache, Wellman makes his character sympathetic without being sentimental. It's a believable characterisation and, overall, an enjoyable read."
1,MOBIL FOR LOOKS ONLY!,"I was dissapointed in the BJT Mobil. When on it only plays for a few min. and then stops, no matter how much I turn the knob. I had to result to using a crib side melody player instead. I have also found that the mobil just get's in the way when changing or putting my son to bed."
1,not a good book at all,the stories missing words and pages changes the scene too much and although it seems valuable the story seems too be dragged out to make the story longer
2,The 74 gun ship Bellona,"This a great book, so why the 2 stars? The book states on the cover that it is a revised edition complete with 1/96 scale fold-out plan. Well when they revised the book I guess they took the fold-out plan ""OUT"". I couldn't find it. I bough 4 books in this series and they all say the same thing but NO PLANS. If it wasn't that the other information in the book is great I would have returned all 4. Still a disappointment."
2,Bertrice - you've disappointed me sorely!,"Unfortunately, this book like Love Slave, Betrayed and Enchantress just does not do the author justice. The characters were trite and I didn't care if they worked out their problems or not. While there were some good ideas to explore in the plot, they were never fully developed. It's hard to believe this was the woman who gave us Skye O'Malley."
3,Predictable...,"This is an okay book. Not bad. Not great. Just okay--but hardly worth the price of a trade sized book. The hero and heroine are well suited, the lovescenes are fun to read, spicy but not too exotic or kinky (as readers have come to expect of Small). There was some profanity and some purple prose but it wasn't heaped on ad nauseum (again, this differs from what readers can usually expect from this author).Parts of this book were really hard to put down but the deception at the end and the plot device involving Trahern were both a trifle boring, and altogether unnecessary and only prolongued the happy conclusion of this otherwise mediocre book. (The ending was a little too trite for my tastes.)I miss the exotic eroticism of Small's other historicals. She really should stick to writing stories in the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries."
2,Bla bla blah,"Ok, I got this book as well as the ultimate guide to Asheville and Western NC today in the mail.First impressions for both of these books was to trow them in the trash.(I am venting my anger here a due to my disappointment and frustration)Why cant someone just write a travel guide without all the fluff?!For your average Joe who is looking for a go here, see that, these are probably not for you.If this book was condensed down to 50 pages I would have preferred that greatly.If a future travel writer reads this PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, keep it simple! stop thinking your gonna be the next best seller for Christ sake!I have a trip to plan, and don't need to spend a month reading a bunch of BS."
5,Hang Your Mags on These,These are the best for filing magazines. They fit so perfectly inside a three-ring binder and the magazines lay flat. A whole year's worth (12 issues) in one binder is great. I purchased 3 sets and know that I will buy more in the future. No more misplaced issues and no more damaged pages. This is a best buy.
1,Made me wish I was deaf,"I was in a store and this CD was playing, and I immediately wanted to rip my ears off. If Yoko didn't have John Lennon as her meal ticket, she would be hunting for food in a dumpster right now. I heard a rumor that the CIA uses Yoko's music as part of their torture/interrogation methods.This gets one star because you apparently can't rate it is -5000 stars."
1,A pathetic excuse for a book,I regret wasting my money on this book. It is simultaneously pretentious and banal -- its lone accomplishment as a book. You will not learn Transact-SQL in 21 days or 21 months using this text. It is mostly a reproduction of the vendor documents. You would be much better served to get Inside SQL Server or the Guru's Guide to T-SQL if you want to get your feet wet with Transact-SQL
4,Excellent Introduction to SQL,The first two thirds couldn't be better. The Last third gets very fiddly and is not as well written.
5,Very Good,Liz is on trial for killing Sam Jessica's boyfriend. Jessica and Todd won't have anything to do with her. It looks like the verdict is in. GUILTY. Then a surprise witness takes the stand......... I thought this was a good book. It was nice to see Liz in trouble. But I think Jess was wrong in stealing Todd.And Todd should have been a more caring boyfriend. And this Margo mystery is killing me. I mean who is she????? I love this book and you should read it too. It's really great!!!!
5,Not A Compilation,"Recorded Live in Carrolltown Pennsylvania in 1957 - Volume 2 was recorded in 1964 in Chicago. Both are a mixture of well known Ellington tunes, not so well known tunes and a few standards. There are no guest vocalists. Ray Nance has a brief vocal on the second, shorter version of the opening Take The A Train but after that it's Duke who does all the verbalizing, introducing the tunes and band members.The whole trumpet section changes personel for the second volume with Clark Terry also being replaced. Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonzalves, Jimmy Hamilton and Harry Carney are present for both concerts.Stanley Dance wrote informative liner notes to both volumes. Very good Collectibles sound quality."
5,Another Winner From Blue Knights,"Duration: 51:57Released on: March 19, 1996A follow up to their all time best seller, Red Night, and the hottest release from the group that started the ""acid Jazz"" phenomenon."
4,jazz meets dance,"More interesting than smooth jazz, more rich than pure dance, Blue Knights takes strong influences of both to create cool grooves. ""Tropical Night"" collects enough material for an entire studio album plus a few previously hard to find tracks including a slowed-down version of their club/trance track ""Gimme all your lovin'"" as well as two other rare gems from Innovative Communication collection albums."
3,BLUE KNIGHTS Tropical Night,"Tropical Night was a bit fast-paced for my liking as Blue Knights music goes; I've always appreciated their languid, meandering smooth jazz stylings over their more up tempo offerings. The music was somewhat predictable; in the same way that eating a bag of generic brand potato chips is predictable in taste. When I listen to Blue Knights I want to feel like I'm cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in a convertible at midnight, rather than feeling like I'm stuck in LA rush hour traffic. Nevertheless, if you're a Blue Knights fan you'll find it acceptable."
3,It Was Good To Know,I browsed through this book to see what was available for kids in Las Vegas. It was good to see so much was there. Parents: Please read this book and keep your kids out of the casinos!
5,good job!,Pleased to get a hard to find book.....arrived right on time. ThanksBTW....the author is a distant cousin which makes this very special.
1,Chinese made,"I thought Bulova was a high quality manufacturer. This watch is made in China. The cover does not fit. The latch won't release, you have to pry it up with your thumb nail. I was very disappointed and returned it the next day."
5,A book of comfort when a mom dies,A friend of mine gave me this book when my mom died of cancer. It is a simple story of a mother and daughter and their life together and how their life details continue even after the mom is gone. It is a wonderful small book and a thoughtful gift to someone grieving the loss of their mom.
3,More bass vocal & drums mayhem ...,"... actually, the songs seem pretty tight and organized. This album comprises twelve unreleased tracks from 95-97 and eight live tracks recorded at SHOWBOAT Tokyo on 7th Feb. 97, and feature guests on sax, vocals, guitar, and keyboard. Displaying the usual but good side of ruins we all know and hopefully love, are the first twelve tracks. Each song manages to have personality within the framework they write. Occasionally expanding on that, doubling the bass melodies with some odd keyboardish effect, or the electronic manipulations of ""Still Life,"" an adequately titled piece. The next eight are live tracks and I think are more interesting because of the guests, and the different sounds they contribute to the band. Ends on a prog rock medley which is dedicated to and features tunes from twenty-four prog bands. Though I can only recognize one of them..."
1,"A Yelp, A Yearning, A Bleat, A Whine","Except for the single, ""Hands Down"", and the aching ""As Lovers Go"", Dashboard Confessional's A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar is the worst release by a potential superstar act in years. On the cusp of commercial breakthrough, Chris Carraba and company forsake their campfire confessionals for band arrangements and beefier sound. Problem is, Carraba's material works best with its shared intimacies - those hushed moments racing along to the next rousing chorus on the cusp of audience participation. A Mark... sounds as tedious as everything else on the radio right now. Alternative title: A Yelp, A Yearning, A Bleat, A Whine."
4,Not quite sure,"This cd just sounds a bit...not as good? Even through their acoustical sets such as #6, it's just produced as well I think. Hands down is a good song, but apparently it was mass played through MTV. Shame. I think number 3 is a really good song. One thing I can still give Chris Carabba is that he has great lyrical-writing abilities. However, he should have just stayed in FSF."
5,each time....for better or better,Dashboard...A mark a mission a brand a scar...ive falling love again..for sure...i can listen to this cd without skipping one track...any dashboard fan has to pick it up and if your not a fan...well you pick it up too punk...itll be well worth your money...
1,Get the Old Stuff,"This CD, sad to say is a disappointment. I have been a die-hard Dashboard fan for 2 years and I am completely in love with The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most and The Swiss Army Romance. These are two of my absolute favorite CD's and Chris Carraba has sadly changed his ways. This new album is full of pop lyrics and are drained of emotion, I miss the old Chris and want him back the way he was. I strongly suggest you buy one of his old CD's but this one is not worth your money."
1,"Look up ""sissy"" in the dictionary","And you'd see Chris CARRAPPA's boyish mug with that puppy dog ""I'm so vulnerable and sensitive and I just know that's gonna get some girls back stage tonight""-look on his face. The Cult of Carrabba is truly a frightening prospect: A bunch of moppy haired emo boys and whimpy girls who have never heard of Bob Dylan or Elliot Smith and who follow a 27 year old untalented singer who obsesses over high school romance.Most people say ""What you have a problem with singers who aren't afraid to show their emotions?"". The answer is no, I have a problem with singer songwriters who aren't good at what they do. This is audio diarhea.Please do yourself a favor and check out Dylan, Smith, Ben Harper, Nick Drake or Jeff Buckley."
5,"A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar is a great cd","I first heard this CD when I was visiting my cousin, and then as soon as I got home I bought it! chris carrabba's voice makes me melt! haha! all the songs on this cd are amazing. my favorites (absolute favorites- i love them all thought) are:1. hands down2. rapid hope loss3. as lovers go4. carry this picture5. bend and not break6. ghost of a good thing7. am i missing10. so beautiful13. several ways to die tryingahah thats alot isnt it. but seriously if i could i would rate this higher than 5 stars, i love it that much. it is always either in my discman or my cd player."
5,Rebirth,"D/C has never sounded better. They have the maturity of Daves Matthews band and the grit and soul of the Counting Crows. Since there previous album Chris has dug deep into his soul and found the brightest and darkest sounds and feelings and have put them into words that anyone can understand if you have ever been loved, in love, hurt or still searching. ""just bend the pieces like they fit/like they were made for this/ but they werent made for this"" finding solace in yourself and finding a peace of mind is what artist search for and D/C has found that in there music. This album is a rebirth of band coming from childhood into a world of lost emotions and fears and they have characterized this transition on this album."
1,"Do not buy this album, you'll regret it","My friend has this cd and he sings along with these lyrics meaningfully. It makes me sick. I don't like this band, all this guy talks about is how he's sad, becuase he broke up with his girlfriend. 1 or 2 songs is alright, but the cd is full of these songs. The guitar work is unimpressive, alll he does is play easy chords, or uses wierd tunings. I'm not agianst acoustic music(I like Dave Mathew's slow stuff), but this is horrible."
3,NOT THE SAME DASHBOARD,"IM GONNA MAKE THIS SHORT AND QUICK. I THINK CHRIS IS FINALLY OVER THE HEARTBREAK. I COULDNT HEAR HIS PAIN IN HIS VOICE LIKE YOU COULD BEFORE. WHICH IS GOOD AND BAD. GOOD BECAUSE YOU DONT WANT TO KILL YOURSELF AFTER LISTENING TO THE TRACKS, LIKE THE PREVIOUS CDS. BUT POSSIBLY BAD FOR THOSE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE GENRE ""SLICE YOUR WRISTS AND BLEED TO DEATH EMO"" OH WELL. THIS CD NEEDS TO GROW ON ME REALLY QUICK LIKE THE EARLY ONES OR ILL JUST RETIRE IT."
5,awes0me!,"wow. im a big dashb0ard fan, and this is their best cd ever! they keep their same go0d old sound while at the same time trying out other styles of music! i luv it!!the new and improved Hands D0wn is my personal favorite! d0nt listen 2 any of the bad stuff people keep saying about this album!! check it out 4 yourself!! buy it n0w!!"
4,different in a good way,"This cd is different than the usual DC stuff. It is much more amped up than the other 2 cds, which were basically just Chris and an acoustic guitar. They have made some changes like adding electric guitars and more drums. Having heard their older stuff I understand that some DC fans are mad because of the new sound. To new fans I would reccommend this cd as well as ""The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"""
3,Disappointing,I was a huge fan of The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most and to a lesser extent The Swiss Army Romance but this album is a very different Dashboard. The full band plays on every track except one but in a way more pop-punk-bubblegummy kind of way than on their previous stuff. It really does seem like an intentionally more commercial release that fits more alongside pop-punk bands than acoustic emo. Even the lyrics seem to lack emotion. That's not to say there aren't some good songs on here - it definitely has it's moments (Am I Missing is an amazing song) but it's too much of a departure from what Dashboard used to be all about. Maybe I just need to give it more time to grow on me however if you're looking for something to compete against The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most then you won't find it here.
3,WAY Better off Acousticly,"DC was my favorite band until chris picked up the electric guitar. The emotional lyrics and chirs's voice are just a better fit for an acoutic sound. Maybe acouple of songs sound just as good electricly such as ""Hands Down"", but for the most part its disappointing. I really wish DC would have stayed acoutic.songs that got the stars:1. Hands Down3. As Lovers Go7. Am I Missing10. So Beautiful"
5,Best Dashboard CD Yet!,"Wow, I just purchased the new Dashboard CD and cannot stop listening! The album in it's entirety is incredible! Each song is well produced and filled with catchy melodies and passion. Especially ""Bend and Not Break"" (#5) which is a stand out on its own! I definitely recommend it for both old and new fans. It's Dashboard at it's best!"
4,"Ho, ho, ho!","This is a boxed set featuring Bob Rivers first two Christmas albums (Twisted ChristmasandI Am Santa Claus) plus the ""bonus disc""Twisted Tunes 1994: The Year in Review. I have reviewed all these albums separately, so there's really no need to review them here. I'll just say they're funny and leave it at that."
5,Terrific,"This is a great memory upgrade for a very reasonable price (in the secondary market, that is. These days, I wouldn't pay more than $80 for a card this size.) It snapped right into the second memory slot and really speeds up my computer. Great!"
1,184 pin memory board,"So far I haven't been able to make it work. But I'll keep trying, I've got a man who works for IBM coming when he gets time to see if he can detect the problem,"
1,"I still haven't received my product yet, who shoul I talk to?","I haven't received my book yet, who should I talk to to get my money back.Thanks, Lien"
4,Excellet Read,"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. I couldn't really relate to Sam because I have never lost my best friend, but I could really feel her pain. They shared everything together and I can't even begin to imagine what it's like losing that. This book has a great story line and kept me turning the pages wondering what would happen next. I really do reccomend this book to anyone who is ready for a tear-jerker that will teach you to not take for granted what you have, and will deeply inspire you."
1,i'm supposed to cry but i don't like being manipulated,the author must be asking people she knows to write good reviews of this book. i wanted to like it but how can i when it is like watching the young and the restless.
5,sequel!,"...The sequel, which is tentatively set for release...is called ""The Farther You Run"". There was also a movie produced based on the book, but at this time has no plans to be released in theatres or on video. But keep your eyes open!..."
5,"2 sisters, we both loved this book!","This book was very sad but very good. The author, David Wills Hurwin, was smart to alternate the chapters being narrated by Sam and Julie because you got to know each character's individuality and different views on the same events. READ THIS BOOK!"
5,"This could possibly be the best book I've ever, ever read!","A Time for Dancing was so wonderful, I could not stop crying even after I finished, this book touched my heart not like any other has. I felt that I knew both girls and had a connection with them since I too take ballet and the strange thing is one of my dance teachers name is Linda and I have a good friend named Julie. This was a very hard book to read in the fact that you knew what was going to happen, but when and how it was going to end. I think Davida Wills Hurwin is one of the best authors I've read, thank you for writing and publishing this book, it truely was amazing and inspirational...I'm looking forward to sequal....I hope it is as good as this one.....I would totally thing everyone should read this book, it should be a novel for english classes everywhere...all I can say is WOW!!!!!"
4,"Finally, new and original material with a sense of nostalga","This one grows on you! First time I listened to it a couple of tracks caught my ear. Then, played it again, and again and its get better each time I hear! If sampling, go to tracks #2 and #3 for some cool tunes! Having opened for Roger Waters and played with other names, Mike Stone is a hot gutarist with a tight band to boot!"
1,Did not receive but charged,I was sent by Osprey Talon the wrong items and I returned as requested but have not received correct item or refund. Luis Cuesta
2,Rob 32,I read this book followig a rave tv review by other authors. What a disappointment. I still can't decide if it is a french travel promo or an excuse for a confused sexual fantasy.
2,Difficult to read,I was really looking forward to starting this book based on the positive reviews. But I was very disapointed. I had a very difficult time reading this book. It is slow to develop and filled with many unnecessary details.
5,Mejor cd del año!,"This is by far my favorite cd. I have so many cds in spanish, and Obie Bermudez I could listen to for hours. Even my friends who don't know Spanish love this cd."
2,Kinda gross,"I bought these for my children. Mine seemed to work and hatch and grow fine, but they were gross looking and smelling. I had initial problems getting the packet to go to the bottom of the tank but after waiting for about three times what the directions said these things did hatch. The water was dark and murky and it looked like I had dozens of swimming roaches in there. My children were afraid of them, and I was a little intimidated by them as well.I would buy sea monkeys before buying these things."
5,Aquasaur,"My 7 yr old grandson will love getting this gift for Christmas, his older brother has a pet frog and he will love getting his own pet to care for. This gift fills a need for a gift for a boy who loves pets."
2,Eggs did not hatch,"My son received the Aquasaur Habitat for Christmas. He was very excited to get the habitat started. We did everything right, we used spring water, let it heat up to 74 degrees, then added the eggs and stirred them up. Nothing happened after four days. I have a very disappointed 5 year old! I tried calling Uncle Miltons and they have very limited hours."
3,flimsy,"We have had this product before, I forgot how flimsy the container was. Last time we had one aquasaur hatch and grow into a large (I guess) adult. Unfortunately, this time we got two that hatched and died a week later."
5,Fun!,"My son, who is 5, has had so much fun observing these little creatures. The instructions are very clear. I bought this kit (...)and really didn't expect much from it, but have been very surprised how everything has worked exactly the way the booklet states! My son tells all his friends at school each day about his fish and they all are very much in awe that these fish are from ""dinosaur times"". One of the better birthday gifts my son has received -- educational, easy directions and fun!"
1,It's a Dud,"I bought this as a gift for my nephews. Their mother helped them set it up. She is a very meticulous person and went through the directions twice. After two attempts, nothing ever happened. I would not recommend this as a gift. It's just to sad to watch the disappointment."
2,Waste of time,I rented this for free thanks to a coupon. All I can say is that the price was right.The movie drags on and on slowwwwwwwly. Nothing happens. It's just so uneventful and dull. You will have more fun watching paint dry.
1,Lame is even too good a word for this one.,"This is by FAR, the worst movie I have seen in years. Bought it yesterday, and today it sits in the bottom of my trash can and even THAT is too good for it. I cannot see how any intelligent person would get even the least enjoyment from this filth hollywood, deemed as a movie. Save your money and go out to a nice dinner instead. Absolutely degrading to watch."
2,Better than I expected,"A movie father-son storyline, and archery saved this movie from a lousy review. Caine was awesome as always but the film was not."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"The movie was extremely boring and had no point. The movie follows a weather man and his extremely messed up family. I swear they must live near a toxic waste dump. They are all total moolies. Watching this movie reminded me of being in a walmart on a sunday morning...Watching this movie was cruel and unusual punishment.To the people that say this movie was artistic. I like ""artsy"" movies, and this one wasn't ""artsy"" at all. Just plain retarded."
3,"American Beauty clone doesn't hit bullseye, despite Cage and Caine","I'm a Nicolas Cage fan but I don't think Cage really shines in this movie. It's not his acting but the story doesn't quite make it. Cage plays the role of a Chicago Weather Man, estranged from his wife and with a dying father. He's a man that doesn't measure up despite some success in his chosen career. He also knows he doesn't measure up and is continually making half hearted attempts at reform that if anything make things worse. Still his heart is in the right place and you empathise with him. By accident he takes up archery and perhaps driven by his father's death does make progress. Some of the best scenes in the movie are shots of the weather and the seasons as they advance on the Great Lakes. Michael Caine delivers, as you would expect, a sterling performance as Cage's author father. I suspect the producers were aiming for another ""American Beauty"" here and the themes are similar. Unfortunately the arrow lands just off target."
2,Weatherman movie,"OK movie but in some cases weak script and an ending that was a little lacking. But some good moments and a few good lines. Cage just always plays himself, but the supporting cast was excellent."
5,Great for Nic Cage Fans!,Nic Cage gives us an exceptional performance - sweet! I laughed at his quirky character all through the movie and his relationship with his kids and the rest of his family is hysterical. I'm sure if you aren't a big fan of Nic Cage you won't like this one much. But this is one of those rare movies where he surprises people with his rarely revealed acting talent.
1,this movie is tired,a film that takes a turn for the darker side of life is a played out concept. Nick Cage s down on his luck in life&other areas this film about a Weatherman doesn't have any Sun in the forecast&is real gloomy. not a memorable film at all.
1,"Dreary, dismal, disappointing","Crude in spots. Despite two good actors, Cage and Caine, fails to elicit caring about them (except in a negative way). If the second half (which I didn't watch) turned up the happy music and redeemed the main character, it's unwarranted and unbelievable. If you're going to waste your time, rent it or borrow from the library."
1,Awful !!!,This is the silliest film I've ever seen and the foul language only made it worse. I'm surprised Michael Caine even wanted to be a part of it! Don't waste your time & money on this.
1,a good review about a stupid guy,"Maradona fue un gran jugador, Por cierto no el mejor de la historia como siempre repiten los argentinos y si un aproblemado, drogadicto y escasamente inteligente deportista. Este libro cumple con lo básico de una reseña de un jugador que no alcanza la categoria de personaje. I m sorry, Maradona was a good player, not a caracter, not a nice person. Only for Diego fans (silly people)"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with the album. A couple of funny songs, but most were annoying or plain dumb!"
2,"Skip this one, get the other","Skip this album, but do get the other Twisted Christmas by the same group."
2,No Bargain,This anthology is overpriced for what it is. Most of the excerpts are too brief and lacking in context to be of much use or interest. The two episodes that are presented complete are not particularly distinguished. Print quality is very variable and often poor. The two-disk format might lead one to expect more: disk 1 is just over 90 min. and disk 2 is barely 50 min. The extremely interesting field of early serials deserves a better showcase.
3,Red by W.G. Snuffy Walden/W. Holzman,"I'm trying to find the song Red byW.G. Snuffy Walden/W. Holzman. If anyone has a copy please let me know. I would really appreciate it. Thanks, Hayley"
1,More SNUFFY!!!,"Ignore this disc if you are a fan of the show. All of the music, save the last track featuring W.G. ""Snuffy"" Walden's original score, is disposable ""hip"" trash designed to sell more copies to stupid people. I should know. I bought one. It's not with this world any longer and I feel the better for it. True fans should demand a compilation of his various themes and toss these drink coasters at the company's building. Incidentally, you can find an entire albums-worth of equally touching ""Snuffy"" themes on the wonderful ""thirtysomething"" soundtrack. Yay!"
2,Disappointed.,I have a few mammoth books that are either of the horror/terror genre. They're usually pretty good. I'm a Stephen King devotee myself & it's usually hard to find good horror that I'll actually pay attention to. This book just didn't cut it for me. Usually the majority of the stories are great...but this book left me hanging. I'm reading The Mammoth Book of New Terror right now and am pleased as punch. Best New Horror Vol. 15 just was a DISAPPOINTMENT!
3,Facinating Vatican Information--then a dramatic drop off!,"This book is started in a manner of which only the great (late) Fr. Martin, SJ is capable- dramatic, with panache and leaving the reader thinking he or she has their own inside source on papal and curial happenings. Even reading a text set in 1972 gives the reader an interesting view of the last conclaves of the 20th century. Martin begins comparing each pope (Pius XII, John XXIII & Paul VI) and their relationship with Augustin Cardinal Bea, SJ- who happened to be the mentor of the author. We come away realizing the sway Cardinal Bea had and the privledged information Martin possesed. However...by mid point Martin begins a 100 page tangent on sociological tendencies and cultural failings of the West. Besides slowing the book pace, this detour leaves the reader scrathching thier head pondering the relevance."
5,A must have for COMLEX prep,"This book is great. It presents the material clearly and concisely. It has some great charts, good images, and ""Trigger Points"" - areas pointing out the key information on a topic that can be quickly reviewed at the last minute.This book IS NOT FOR basic understanding and initial learning of OMT fundamentals or techniques; however, it is perfect for review. Certain topics may need to be supplemented with course notes, Foundations, or another resource (ex: Crainal); but overall the book serves its purpose of putting the important information all in one book with an easy to read format."
5,Great for boards.,Pretty much everything in this book was on the test. If its marked to know I had at least one question on it. Just a good synopsis and also helpful on the anatomy questions too.
5,the swelleres - end of discussion,this cd is a great punk cd by a great punk band with nick danger bringing great guitar riffs and great vocals along with good songwriting the swellers are a great band with explosve live shows i recomend this cd to anyone
5,my cat likes it,"I received this carrier and just finished assembling it. (Which was easy) I put it down on the floor next to the Amazon box and my cat walked over, climbed in, and went to sleep. I say- quite an endorsement."
2,not hot enough,"I initiated return of this item to Amazon today.I tried using it two times, and the plates just don't get hot enough to properly sear the food, as several other reviewers have noted.Grill marks are fait and few between, and steak turns out more steamed than grilled.My old GF grill did get hot enough - but was too small and didn't have removeable plates.I hoped this would have at least equivalent performance, despite some poor reviews. Sadly, it did not.Don't make the same mistake I did. Only buy this is you don't care if it sears as well as the old GF grills."
5,whoa!!,[...]great product definitely a step up from the 1st gen of foreman grills. lovely temp gauge and removable cooking surface. A definite need if you are on the south beach or atkins diet. Grease slides off and easy to clean!! Yummy! id buy more as presents to friends!!
2,Poor heating,This George Foreman does not provide the heating of the older models. A hot dog would be done in 5 minutes compared to about 15 minutes on the rectangular. It uses more electricity. The removable plates are good for cleaning but that's about all. Sorry I bought it.
1,Great idea-bad implementation+safety hazzard-Save your money,"Completely unsafe. Spewed large amount of burnt plastic smoke, rickety clamps to hold on plates, steamed, did not ""fry"" hamburger. Took twice as long as book said to cook, took 3 times as long as the smaller GF grills do. Plastic top too hot to touch even 10 minutes after it was unplugged. Did I mention it smelled like burning plastic for the entire time it was on?"
1,It is a piece of junk,"Pretty bad, because:-grill heats unevenly. Cook a full grill of bacon and see what I mean.-alarm sounds right at the frequency that is most often lost to hearing, especially in older men.-plastic case arrived broken. It is poorly cast. Fortunately the 3"" piece that was broken off did not affect functionality. There was no damage to the shipping carton-it came from the factory that way!-the appliance takes up at least two inches more counter space in both directions than it needed to, had it been designed correctly.-Amazon would have taken it back but we decided to keep it because we don't have time to chase down a Delonghi right now, so Amazon gave us a partial refund. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,Foreman took the heat out of the kitchen,"I am very upset with this grill. I was expecting something that actually gets hot enough to cook my food to a grill type consistency. At least leave some marks where the raised parts of the grill plates were in contact with the food. But this grill won't heat up to the max temp. even after ten minutes of pre-heating. I don't recommend this grill to anyone who is looking for a nice, hot grill. I think I could do better just leaving the food out in the sun."
1,Piece of !@#$!@!,Since day one the item never heats up at all. We set it to the desired temperature but it never reached it. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!
1,This grill is not what it's cracked up to be.,I have had this grill for 7 months and I just threw it away and bought a competitors grill. The GF Grill does not get hot enough to cook burgers and will ruin a good meal. Buyer beware!
2,Disappointed,"After looking at ALL the reviews and not feeling very pleased with the customer ratings, I decided to get it anyway. OMG!!!! I don't like it. It doesn't keep it's temp. I don't like it....I don't like it... I wish I could send it back.Don't buy this one. I have had other GF, but this one sucks."
1,These Should be Recalled,"Wow - I wish I'd read the reviews here before buying. Seems my experience was a textbook case: bought this because my previous Foreman grill, while it cooked well, had CHEAP teflon and was a NIGHTMARE to clean. Bought the GRP99, and during the first use, smoke poured out and the top melted. We nevertheless managed to use it maybe five or six more times over the next four months, but it never cooked particularly well. Then last night, I plugged it in, and it's DEAD. No power.Clearly there's a big market for this type of product. Too bad the folks at Salton can't manufacture anything of quality to save their lives. I'm going back to my broiler.This model is clearly a dud, and should be recalled. Class action lawsuit, anyone?"
3,Power cord extremely short,The power cord is EXTREMELY short - only long enough if you place it directly in front of an outlet. I had to buy an extender.
2,Very Unhappy,"I purchased this grill for my family of four, about two months ago. I have only used it three times. Each time I use it, I have such a difficult time afterwards cleaning the ""top removeable plate"" to the grill. I just cannot get the plate clean... I use a gentle scrub-sponge with dish soap and then rinse with hot water. Even washing it the last time I used it, three times, it still has food stuck in its grooves. I am so upset, for I have wasted my money on what I thought would be a great addition to our kitchen. The cooking surface is cheaply made, the silicone coating is really thin. Any suggestions on what to do.... before I throw it out!!!"
2,Reliability an issue,"I've seen reviews stating that the reliability of these grills is an issue and can confirm that mine packed up in less than 4 months with very little use. Amazon have been great and sent me a replacement but if they hadn't I wouldn't be rushing to purchase another one, probably go back to one of their older models and live with the horrible cleaning."
1,This item is DANGEROUS!!,"Unlike the other reviewers who pointed out the dangers of a melting heating element, my issue is what I consider to be a dangerous and defective design, namely, the removable plates. They are held on by thin, cheap, flimsy clips, that, apparently, can deform or come loose when the unit is heated. Several times now, when cooking, I have lifted up the top only to have the ""removable"" part come crashing off. A 350 hot piece of metal landing on your feet, your cat, or God forbid, a child underfoot is not something anybody would want. Stay far away from this piece of junk, it could burn you or worse. This issue, combined with other safety issues made in other reviews make me wonder how on earth this item ever made it onto the market. George, you oughta be ashamed of yourself for foisting this junk item on the public."
4,works well; easy to clean; a little small,The only negative is that I need it to be a little larger. It is much easier to clean than the older ones!!! Overall good value.
3,Beware,I got this grill as gift a long time ago and it worked fine. Except for the fact that it doesn't close well over thick meat therefore is has uneven cooking. My top grill plate fell off twice recently for no apparent reason. So be careful when buying this grill. the handles are not constructed well enough to handle alot use. Im searching for a new grill.
3,Summer Grilling has begun,"The George Foreman Grill works well, I use it for grilling fish, meats and poultry. I received it within three business days which was great. Thanks Amazon."
4,"Great for small meals, but...","I got this as a wedding gift in July and have literally used it 3-5 times per week since with absolutely no problems. We had guests for dinner the other night, however and the extra pork chops appear to have killed the grill. Not good.Still, I wouldn't want to live without it on a daily basis and their customer service was great when I just called. They're e-mailing me a mailing label to send my unit back and they'll send me a new one. They were very pleasant and helpful. I'll update this once the transaction is complete, but so far, no worries except cleaning the broiler when we have guests in!"
2,Loved it till it died,"We bought this grill in August 2005 and pretty much used it every day for something, usually bacon. I loved being able to put the plates in the dishwasher. Then Sunday as I was grilling steaks for my son's birthday supper I noticed the power light was off. We checked the ground fault breakers and the plug in. Nothing wrong there. Then we looked under the grill. The bottom has what looks to be a wire that has melted through the bottom and is visible on the outside. I was really surprised that our countertop wasn't damaged. It is definitely a fire hazard. The Salton company is sending me a postage label to return it for replacement but I won't be able to trust this brand of grill now and will buy myself a different brand. I have seen several reviews that have had this same problem."
5,Indoor grilling,Far superior to the original George Foreman Grill because the grills can be removed for cleaning and it has a timer and thermostat. Love it for chicken and veggies. Also makes a great panini grill
4,defines objective measures of success,"Tubke surveys many recent spin offs, and this book appears to be essentially his PhD thesis. The idea is to study what factors contribute to the success or failure of spin offs, as a guide to the future.Hence, there is a fair amount of multifactor regression analysis, to tease out the contributions of various factors. The study is also broken up by industry. Which makes sense, as a given industry might have unique conditions for its companies. Doesn't make the analysis any easier though.The author also went to some effort to define objective, measurable quantities, against which to assess success or failure. Perhaps, and this can be contentious, this might be the best use of the book. Where you assess whether those quantities are indeed relevant to your corporate situation and industry. So that, if you are contemplating a spin off, you have some metrics to apply."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased a couple of these directly from Peach Tree and when they arrived I found that both of them weren't even close to being flat, both were bowed up in the middle. I called Peach Tree and was instructed to bend them to straighten them out. That worked somewhat but they still aren't as flat as they're supposed to be. I would not buy this product again."
4,A little dry but a fun reflection,I am a fan of Tom McCombas's collection of Lionel and toy train videos. This one is a bit dry because the interviews become lengthy with some weird edits. Primarily bought it for my son's obsession with toy trains but ended up enjoying more for myself. If you are fascinated by toy trains and their collectors this is a good see.
3,good but wide and big,wasn't great for me. Those thongs are too roomy for me. I have a thin feet so they weren't good on me. If you buy them get size 1/2 smaller than your real size.
5,Sceptacisim Paid Off,"I first heard anything from Jekyll and Hyde at State Acting Competition and was really sceptical about the music and lyrics, but bought the CD anyway. I absolutely love it! The music is powerful yet soft in it's own way and the actors' voices portray the characters and emotions the best I have ever heard on a cast recording.Hyde is so powerful with his voice, and he only grows when he turns into Jekyll and it shows thorough his voice and you can hear in his voice all turmoil and emotions that he's experiencing. All in all a wonderful musical and I can't wait to see it on stage!"
3,Understanding the Dreams you Dream,I like this book but I prefer the Ultimate version because the Ultimate give greater details concerning numbers and colors and it also has other symbols that I have dreamed of that was not in Understanding the Dreams you Dream.
3,not as comprehensive as i would have liked it to be. Not enough of the dictionary part.,What was there was interesting but not enough of it. I go to look something up andit isn't there. I gets frustrating when I am on a roll. What was there was good
5,A MUST for those who need spiritual understanding,"A great book to find out how, and what God speaks to us in dreams. Great dictionary!!!"
5,Pleases my girlfriend...,"but not as much as I do.I bought this as a gift for her, as her old one was on it's way to the big recycling bin in the sky, or where ever they send old electronics, I think it is Africa or India.Anyway, she loves it and uses it every day, and thanks me everyday for it.Well built. Super fast shipping.If I played Sudoku, I would get one for myself."
4,The BEST Thing to come from this Movie(?),"YES - The BEST Thing to come from the flim(don't bother w/ the flick)...The Soundtrack Album, however, was a grand creation of the times - and still holds up as a fantastic listening experience(w/ the possible exception of 'Smash It Up'; sorry Offspring).But, let's face it, ""Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me"" by U2 & ""Kiss from a Rose"" by Seal, are damn near unforgettable. And when you throw in artists like The Flaming Lips, Brandy, Method Man, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Massive Attack, & Michael Hutchence(RIP), it's one album any Soundtrack fan should have in their collection."
3,Decent Stuff,"Not the best soundtrack ever, but Nick Cave's song is great. Just get past the silly generic songs from U2, Seal, Flaming Lips, and PJ Harvey."
4,Seal and U2 rocks!!!!!!!!,"Kiss By a Rose and Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill me are the only two good songs in my opinion.The othes aren't worth it."
3,How could a CD with Eddi Reader on it be bad?........Well...,"I bought this CD only for the Eddi Reader song ""Nobody Lives Without Love"". If for that song only my money was well spent. Several of the other songs are enjoyable, but as far as soundtracks go it is nothing special."
1,"The Cup, DVD","This film could be very joyfull. But as the film on this DVD only contains of Chinese and Tibetan language the film will not be enjoyed by most. The offer does not mention about these languages, and the missing of English language. If I order a title in English, I can assume that I get something in English. Or not?"
3,"Slow Read, But Okay","I really wanted to love this book and to finish it in a few days. I like fast paced adventure fantasy that puts me on the edge of my seat. The occult theme is a HUGE plus. But it's just not that kind of book. It's not the kind of book you put down and never pick back up, but it's likely not a book you're going to pick up and not be able to put down either. This is what I'd call an intellectual slow read. Meaning -- if you're looking for mere brain candy (which sometimes I am, sometimes not), these books are not it. Instead, this is urban fantasy that makes you think. The world is rich, the writing tight, the plot interesting and intriguing. The charcters are complex and fascinating. I have to hand it to Ms. Saintcrow in that she definitely has written a worthwhile series. It's just not the kind of book I'm going to pick up for fun. This is a novel I'll read a little here, a little there, and maybe more later. Haven't decided if I'm picking up book two or not yet."
2,"Heroine is unlikable, romance is implausible","I'm not hard to please when it comes to reading. I really expected to find this as another guilty pleasure. I love tough heroines and unique romance! However, I was disappointed by how unlikeable the heroine was. She wasn't supposed to yell because of her powers as a necromancer, but most of the book, that's exactly what she was doing. She was always full of acid and when she was nice, it didn't really make sense. The competing romances were also disappointing. This book made me feel like the author was actively hating men while writing it. She couldn't appreciate men for anything other than their muscles. I was quite disappointed. If I want to get away from the depressing aspects of life, I don't want to read a book where the main character is so depressing. Interesting world, unlikable characters. This just didn't make sense."
4,A great gamble,"It's strange how you come across good books. I took a gamble on this book after reading someone give it a bad review. The same person wrote a bad review on a book that I thought was fantastic. My gut feeling was very good on this one. I loved this book!For years my favorite author was Laurell K. Hamilton. This has been slipping lately due to her main characters becoming such dim witted nymphos.If you love strong characters that aren't afraid to stand up to creatures stronger than them, then you will love Dante Valentine."
1,You get what you pay for...,Bought this for Nuru massage purposes. Popped within three uses. No patches or repair kits included. Wish I had spent a little more and bought one with thicker plastic.
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!,"I still don't really know why I bought this CD in the first place. Probably because I liked the song ""I Can Love You Like That"" and figured the rest of the CD would be equally good. WRONG. I detest every other song on here. The only reason for the two star rating is because of the strength of that one song."
3,an okay zoid,"This is a pretty good zoid. i was very surprized at how much better it was than i expected. i wasnt going to get this one at first but a few other reviews perswaded me o by it. i dont want to say it was a wast of money, but it was kindov a wast of money. the head is always falling off and it barly moves at all. i always have to push it along so it can sort of move. i hope i dont stop you from buying it if you want to. but this what i think. its just an okay zoid."
2,Nothing to crow about,"My jams were very runny when using this. Not only runny, but the fruit & liquid seperated! I had to mix it together every time I wanted to use it. Due to the excessive moisture, it quickly soaked through & sogged up my home baked bread for sandwiches if it wasn't eaten immediatley. Forget having a sandwich at work! I needed a fork for the soppy mess! I don't plan to purchase it again & even gave away my surplus!I am now using the Pomona's Universal Pectin sugar free & it is fantastic! Every single batch of every type of jam turned out stunning! Excellent color & flavor! I'm so thrilled with Pomonas! Avoid this stuff & invest in the Pomona's, it's the best!"
5,A Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction,(This is) a work of art in the age of digital reproduction.
4,sturdy stroller,We don't have baby yet but we've set it up and played with it a bit. It's very sturdy and everything seems to adjust easily...once you've figured out how that is! So far I only have 2 problems with it: 1. the cupholder won't clip onto the handle properly and 2. the instructions are not great. Will have to update this once we've got a baby to put in there!
3,Awesome for game but has some flaws,"These are really good sounding headphones and the mic attachment is a nice addition. I would give this product 5 stars if it were not for a couple of flaws.Fist if you computer has a grounding loop (which im pretty sure all of them do. Its from every device being connected to the ground including your sound card audio) the headset amplifier amplifies the noise so you can hear your computer crunching, working, mouse moving etc. Gets really annoying. Expect to purchase ground loop isolators for all 3 pins.Secondly the cords and headset itself are fragile. The cords that connect to the computer are so tiny that pulling on them too hard will shurely break them (which is what I believe happened to mine). They also tangle very easily.So so long as your willing to fork up cash for isolators and treat them like a baby (dont tug on the cords) these headphones will make your day."
3,not bad,"I bought this a few years back when it came out and was the only 5.1 computer headset the market to my knowledge. When it worked, the audio output and microphone input worked great. The volume on each of the 5.1 surround speakers is adjustable, so you can adjust the rear speakers to what you think is an appropriate volume for ""behind"" you. The microphone, which detaches from the headset, always had a very finicky connection, as did the connectors on the little black box with the volume control. In recent months, CS:Source causes the sound to go haywire every 30 minutes or so, which has to do with some command the game issues that this unit doesn't like. The earpiece recently broke off, but in their defense I did throw them on the ground countless times."
2,Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook,I bought this revised version for my daughter who grew up eating things I made from my 1970's ring binder copy. The content of this cookbook is great and has some handy information but we both still love my 70's version better.
3,Not as good as it gets,A good basic cookbook. Not a lot of involved marth-esqe recipes but specializes in many good old fashioned delights. Need to have a page holder as the book doesn't work well open on a counter. Desserts are especially well done and represented.
5,Great Resource!,I have always found this book to be an excellent resource; not just for recipes but for the items in the back that tell how to make substituion ingredients as well as measuring tips for when one forgets how to convert measurements. I now try to give this as a wedding present.
4,BHand Garden New Cook Book,"I liked the cookbook but the construction of the book physically doesn't stand up to the kitchen use! The Spine's clips is made of plastic and has broken off therefore the binder will not hold the cover to the looseleaf binder! This occurred within a year of use! I don't recommend buying the book for this reason since we have these cookbooks for life and it's a bad reflection for durablity!Sincerely, Rosalind Luzzi"
5,Great All Around Cookbook,"We recieved this cookbook, 4 1/2 years ago, as a housewarming gift. I use it a lot, more than my other cookbooks. I came here today to look for the 3 ring binder edition, as my paper back is losing pages!!! I can't wait to order this book and put it to more good use. I would reccomend this to any cook, novice or experienced!!!"
5,What a GREAT Cookbook,I originally purchased this book for my mom but when my boyfriend saw the book he LOVED it too! So I had to go and purchase another one so they both could have the cookbook at there dispose all the time.It has GREAT recipes - We've made SO much from this cookbook.The recipes are not difficult to prepare and make. I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.
4,More classic Kansas City swing!,"The third volume of this great series which reissues all of Basie's classic early material in chronological order. In all honesty, I have to admit that I find most of Basie's instrumental material a bit monotonous -- the horn sections are way too punchy and the arrangements, while undeniably swank, are also quite repetitive. But the vocals...? OH BABY! With Helen Humes and Jimmy Rushing splitting the microphone time, what's there to complain about? Her voice is oh-so-sweet and he's got the soulful blues 'way down deep inside. And yeah, the singin' non-vocal tunes are also not to be ignored... With Lester Young, Jo Jones, Don Byas and all those other Kansas City jazz cats running around, this is music that has to be checked out by the true student of jazz... no matter *what* I think!"
3,Good book.,"This work by Grudem is solid and easy to read. I guess one would purchase this for the application sections? For a much more in depth examination of Christian doctrine, one is better to purchase Grudem's systematic theology. Or even better-from the same tradition, R.L Reymond's recent systematic theology."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I give this album one star because it's not the worst music I've ever heard, and one more for ""I Love You Always Forever."" Donna Lewis's talents do not lie in songwriting. Her music is bland and her lyrics don't make much sense. She did not write the one good song this album has to offer. It was a waste of money."
3,More than,Donna's talent as a singular artist who could weave an ambient thread into memorable pop hooks sets her apart from other less progressive divas such as Britney Spears who in comparison may have had more sucess with infectious pop numbers but who clearly are not in Donna's ballpark...
4,Performs as advertised,"Capable recorder that performs as adverstised. Slight background noise when recording, but otherwise intelligible recording. Operation is straight forward with little reference to instruction manual."
4,Works,"Recently bought this off of Amazon. I'm not quite sure what they did during the refurbishing - but the recorder works just fine. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because I find it doesn't really cut background noises very well, although this might be something all recorders do (this is the first one I've owned). In lectures with 300 people the quality isn't really that great, despite the conference/personal settings I put on it - although I guess it's to be expected, but I definitely think this can be improved upon in future recorders.That being said, in one of my smaller classes it's very clear and crisp.Overall, a good buy - the refurbished is much cheaper than a new one, and to be honest I doubt any serious changes were done.Been using it for 2 weeks so far, approx 24h of usage and it's still going fine :) Batteries still indicate full power."
4,Great Deal,"This digital recorder is great, the recording quality is outstanding and it is very easy to download recordings to a computer thru the built in USB conection. The recorder is very light compared to outhers ive used, which makes it nice when you have to carry it in your pocket. I use the recorder for work and use it for interviewing people and recording telephone conversation. The only shortfall is the speaker volume may not be loud enough for some people, the recorders not ment for casual listening of music. In a work environment like in the office its volume is fine but out at the park or beach you will be disapointed. I do not believe any recording device as small and light as this one is loud enough for use at the beach or a park but hook it up to some external speakiers and its just like an IPod. I paid under 60 bucks for this recorder and it is just as good at 300 dollar recorders ive used."
3,I'm not very techno savvy,"I wish that the people writing the instruction manual had a better command of English. If you need the instructions, be prepared to remove a verb here and there to aid your comprehension. GEEZ, Olympus!"
3,"NICE, BUT NOT THE BEST","IT'S A NICE LITTLE GADGET. IT JUST TAKES FOREVER TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND USE IT. I GOT TO RECORD, BUT NOTHING PLAYED BACK, OR I COULD NOT FIGURE ON HOW TO PLAY IT BACK"
4,good recorder,"This is a good recorder and a good value. I'm using it for interviewing people for a research class and it does a pretty good job at picking up both voices. I've never used a digital recorder before so I don't have anything to compair it too but it works well for me. I like that you can save recordings in different ""folders."" It's easy to find the files when you connect to the computer. And you can slow down and speed up the recordings which is nice. Slowing down the recording makes it easier to transcribe interviews."
4,Convenient recorder,"I really like the arrangement of the buttons as well as the file storage. It supports both popular audio file formats that can be transferred to PC.The first one I got drained out the battery within a week unused, but Amazon quickly replaced it with a second one that works perfectly."
5,Great Recorder,This voice recorder was just what we were looking for to do EVP work in our Paranormal Investigations. It is very sensitive and has the added feature of an onboard USB connection that allows for instant hookup to a computer. I will be purchasing more of these in the future.
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"I tested it upon purchase. It worked great one time ...When aI needed to use it a few months later, it would notwork. It won't recharge and won't start no matter what.Spend a little more and get a better quality product.I'm disappointed because Oympus has always been a top qualitybrand. Not any moreToo bad."
4,Great recorder,The recorder works great. It has plenty storage and the speaker is loud enough to review what i recorded. Read some bad reviews about the speakers and quality of MUSIC played with the recorder. Suggestion........buy an Ipod to list to music instead.
2,The screen does not illuminate,"The screen does not illuminate but operationally it is good, I think it's better that way because the battery lasts longer, USB wine wireless."
2,Just OK,I looked at several digital recorders and landed on this one. It's small and seems to record OK. One thing I noticed is the voice activation sometimes misses the first few words of the speaker. This would be fine in many situations as long as ambient noise is low and you're not looking for a super-fine recording.
1,Stay away,"I wont recommended. Major design issue, memory gets messed up after one year and the factory still don't have a fix for it. its not worth it"
4,Great for an intermediate journalist!,"This was my first recorder and I found that it was exactly as described online. It's perfect for me because it's small, light and sleek. I take this recorder with me everywhere and I find that it is quiet enough that most interviewees don't notice that it's there! I love it. The only bummer is that the recorder is a little touchy when trying to fast forward or rewind. Overall I think it's great!"
1,Poor Design Means Built-In Mic is Useless,"The built-in mic on this thing is connected directly to the case. It has no shock-mounting or isolation of any sort. So if you lightly stroke your finger over the case, you'll hear a roar in the recording, as if someone is blowing directly into the mic. This might be a good product if you use some other mic, but it's useless as a simple handheld dictation machine."
5,Price Hike.. this was cheaper several months ago,"This is a great device and I have since given mines away to someone who needs it and I will need to purchase another, but this price is way more than what I paid several months ago.So I give this item five starts because this is made of quality, and records very well and clear, how ever the price has been hiked and it makes no sense to pay this much for this item.This item comes with a case and has a lot of options for a recorder. Nice buttons, and nice quality look and feel. The case is nice because it keeps the screen from getting scratched.Shop around before you pay this current price. I paid $50.00 for this months ago."
3,It works,"Purchased this for making cocktails and it is a good looking spoon with decent balance. The only major issue is how small the concave section of the spoon is. It barely catches the ice and cannot be used like a traditional bar spoon (for measuring) because of it's size. Overall, good product for the price."
3,Shame-Based Man,"It's alright in general. I bought it for the Doors skit, which I love. Otherwise, the rest is alright."
5,Melissa and Doug do it again,"I am a huge fan of M&L and these pillows are awesome. Perfect accent for my lilttle ones new Toddler bed...and they are washable - sold! Hope they hold up OK, time will tell. My sons love them and roll/kick, throw them all around and while they can knock things over, they can't really damage much! The scale of them are pretty big - realistic, baseball is bigger of course than an actual one."
2,Detailed but poorly written Medieval history,"There is no doubt that the author knows his stuff. He provides a thorough introduction to the major themes of the late Medieval/early Renaissance period. However, he has all the flair of a mortician and he systematically sucks the oxygen out of the subject. Furthermore, his writing style uses awkward sentence constructions that leave the reader stumbling through his prose, getting lost, bogged down and frustrated. As an avid historian, I now understand why some people have grown up hating the subject."
1,Quinn Mills unlikely candidate for e-leadership,"E-leadership represents Mills' attempt to re-invent himself for the New Economy. He does not succeed.While Mills has done a fairly good job of gathering a series of individual profiles, he fails to provide a philosophical framework for understanding the central question:""What qualities are required for leadership in the newly wired world?""In addition, like many Web-centric management books of this vintage, many of the protagonists and their lessons seem outdated in the era of the post-crash NASDAQ.While Mills, a former leader in the field of labor relations, brings a great deal of experience to his subject, he fails to bring new insights or disciplined inquiry."
5,Lo mejor de mago,"Es uno de mis grupos favoritos, pero este disco es lo mejor que tienen, es el mas metalero."
4,best handheld since C V,this game is good i have a rom of it and it is good im going to by it when it come out metriod prime is going to be asome to
4,Just too easy,the game has great gameplay and all but im on the the sencond to last boss and ive only had it for 5 days and ive been playin it for 3 hours in thoes five days.and i stink at action games and rpgs. its still a good game though i suggest you borrow it from a friend or some where .
3,Be CAREFUL!,"The golden sun Oh Happy Day, Edwin Hawkins, is NOT the Oh Happy Day reviewed by D.V. Lindner. The CD pic may be above the review, but beware. I even CALLED Amazon.com to be sure to get the correct CD, but Nope. As so many others, I was searching for the version of the title song that was in Secretariat The Movie and the version on the golden sun CD is NOT it.The CD itself is okay and the review re how it was recorded with lesser quality of sound is the review that goes with this picture."
5,I love this game!!,"I teach middle school Spanish and my students LOVE to play this game. They ask to come in during their lunch or study hall just to play the game. They learn new expressions that we haven't covered in class yet, as well as review vocabulary from earlier in the year while having fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to refresh their Spanish vocabulary or learn basic Spanish vocab."
2,Ordered a Swisher - was sent something else,"On the package and on the splitter itself there is NO appearance of the name ""Swisher""! Instead, we were sent a ""Super4rce"" Chinese-made unit with questionable welds, unhardened steel and a hydraulic pump that malfunctioned after the first few logs.After fixing the hydraulic ram we were able to split several very hefty maple rounds with no trouble at all. As we continue to operate this splitter in the future we will always wonder if it will work hydraulically. We'll also be concerned that the soft-metal construction so typical of Chinese tools will become compromised and bend. And we'll watch the welds to see if they crack or disintegrate.The splitter is a GREAT idea! It just needs USA grade construction -- and a larger splitting wedge as well.Time will tell if this was a smart purchase. Buyer beware."
2,Disappointing...,"I found this book disappointing. While it says nothing objectionable, it also says nothing new."
5,Great! I use them everywhere,"I bought these so I could listen to radio at night with out bothering my wife, but I now use them with my Sony video camera to monitor audio while I'm filming."
3,No Consequences,"My 3-1/2 year old loves this book, and it is certainly an amusing tale. However, I don't recommend it as a tool to help teach children acceptable table manners. There are no consequences to Froggy's poor table manners; indeed, after destroying a fancy restaurant, he is rewarded with ""burgers and flies."""
3,"Good resource, but not for first-timers to Immunology","The book jumps head first into some big immunological concepts with out giving significant introduction or explanation. Some of the figures are also sub-par. Not a bad resource, but for first-timers to immunology and for a more thorough discussion of the subject, I would recommend ""Janeway's Immunobiology, eighth edition"" by Kenneth Murphy."
3,I liked it,It has some very easy to work exercises and good info within it. Not perfect by a long shot but it deserves a read or two because Dr. Mumford is very clear in his writings. Goes well with his tattwa card boxed set and would make an excellent addition to Bardon's Initiation into Hermetics book.
3,Similair Technics Speakers,"I have a pair of Technics SB-SL501's that use the same type of drivers and such. The woofers themselves won't take much and I have already blown one out and I have pushed the other one woofer to hard and that resulted in damage to the woofer. The voice coil got seperated!! I don't like the overload protection on the tweeters and midranges, try and crank out Linkin Park and they go out. I find these speakers to be difficult and junky and to top it all off!! .... On the other hand Technics makes the best unbeatable turntables in the world but their speakers could use some more upgrading."
2,"good for internet, not for file sharing","This product actually worked great on myIBM Thinkpad 760XL for surfing the net, worked great onmy Linksys 4 port router (BEFSR41 ver 2) as well.only problem I ran into, was trying to setupfile sharing in Windows 98..the Network Setup wizard, for some odd reason,would not detect the presence of this NIC card,not even after reboot, so because of thatI was not impressed.but it is a great card for those who just want to surfthe net and not use file sharing(still not sure why Network setup wizard won't detect itthat one has me stumped)"
5,Acclaimed by many: Its justified,"This one is famous so not much to say. Great presentation of physics, should be on everyone's shelf, iPad, PC or where ever you read it. I'd recommend it as a reference (no exercises - haven't read it cover to cover -) and it could be a very interesting first read if you have a decent professor (which for Physics I think is common). Of course there are many other books of the subjects mentioned but this one is good as serious compendium. There is a errata webpage, can feel outdated but it's illustrations but is a good trio. There are three main books in the case and a small one."
2,Not as cool as it looks,This water gun is far less cool that it looks. The water stream is thin and not very powerful. The spiral hose and clear resevoir are strictly ornamental. Spend the extra money and get a better water gun.
5,Best Price,I have to take Jarrodophilus several times a day and this purchase had the best price on the Internet.
1,Jarro probiotic,"I took 4 capsules a day of the Jarro-Dophilus EPS probiotic until I finished the box of 120 pills.I would love to say this one works. Sorry, in my case this probiotic didn't work at all and was a total waste of my money. Companies making probiotics make some towering claims about their products. I have found only one so far that worked fairly well for about 8 months until 2 sets of anti-biotic pills destroyed my digestion. I am currently trying Florastor. Another probiotics shouting we are number one. So far, these pills ain't working either and to add insult to injury the Florastor pills are very expensive."
3,probiotic,Too early to rate. I have only taken for a week. The product was purchased at the request of my doctor. Sure hope this product will help with IBS.
5,Excellent,"Russell alternately brings feeling and energy to the tracks on this amazing album. There are tracks you can kick back to and others you will want to turn up. The musicians along for the ride are stellar. This guy should have been a huge star (he was on his way in the early 70's), but as Gatemouth Brown told a friend of mine, Leon ""spent a little too much time in the 60's."" Luckily, albums like Leon Live, and the self titled LP clearly show what he was capable of and why he was so sought after as a musician by the greats of his day (The Stones, Clapton, George Harrison, Cocker, Dylan). If you like any of the names just mentioned there is probably something on this album for you. A lot of the tracks are the kind found on Exile on Main Street (full-sound -- gospel back-up singers, horns). Good stuff."
4,joke book,I believe this tome was funny in many aspects and some of the jokes were really funny. Many of the jokes can be adapted for use at certain presentations such as seminars and business meetings. I think it's worth the price. John.
2,Collapsible Golf Travel Bag,I returned this because my standard size golf bag did not fit in it. It was also unstable on its wheels pulling it.
3,not worth the hype or money,This product has it's good and bad. The good: it feels like water on the skin. No oily residue to wash off. The bad: it doesn't take off eye makeup that well and it's expensive. Save yourself the money and buy something else.
5,heartfelt beauty,"this collection of earls ballads is so moving the master takes you through these beautiful classics.the moving this time,julie,chrstia,and my favorite if your still in love with me.other suggestions are soda fountainshuffle,life stories,and love stries earl is a master who will go down in jazz history"
5,Trivia with a punch (and bite)!,"My wife HATES video games but not this one. We both love trivia and game shows and ""Jack"" has the best of both. The questions are not ready for prime time (Yes, that's my final answer), still we were laughing from question 1 to 21. Nothing to play with younger children, but for adults it's the twister of 2000. You will get hooked on this game, thank God it comes with 2 CD's so you will have plently of questions to 'dis n dat' about."
4,You don't know jack,"If you like the Computer version then you will like this game. It is for Playstatin but can be played on Playstation 2. It is almost the same as the computer game except that there are more questins and no gibberish question (personally that was my favorite.) The gams also automaticly saves game data to your memory card so that the owner of the game can't cheat by knowing the answers already. It's a fun party game, who would want to sit around a computer screen to play a game when you can use your TV?"
4,work bootss,"The boots are ok, difficult to break them in because of the stiff leather. other than that, they are excellent."
1,Not same quality as Timberland retail store,"I previously tried on these boots in a Timberland retail store and loved them. They were very comfortable, but expensive. When I saw the same boots on Amazon for considerable savings, I ordered them. They are the same boots, I checked the item number. The boots I received looked identical, but the leather was as stiff as the plastic boots sold at low end department stores for around $20. I tried to break them in but could only wear them for 30 minutes at a time. I called Timberland customer service and they told me to buy a bottle of leather conditioner??!!. They finally became comfortable after about a month. They aren't marked ""seconds"", but they are definitely not the same quality. I would not recommend buying these boots online."
1,Not What I ordered.,"The product that I thought I was buying was a certain color and double soled like the picture shows. Unfortunately that isn't what they sent, as I received a single soled boot that wasn't even the same style as the one I ordered. Make sure you check what you are buying as I thought I was getting a deal and then realized I could have gotten them cheaper somewhere else."
5,Termite Pruff Copper,"Interesting product, seemed to wipe out a minor infestation I had by spraying it into a hard to reach area."
1,IT'S NOT A REVIEW,"Amazon - Has started to pull fast ones on it's readers. Lisa Hopkins' few paragraphs are not a review but a notice. A review is an intellectual participation in the premise of a book and with the evidence presented for it. What Hopkins gives is merely a notice of the contents of the book. As such,even,it's inferior to the notices in the New York Book Review section in the Times on Sundays. Hopkins should read the New York Review of Books for a while, and then write a proper review. Per Amazon: I will not buy any more such shallow nonsense. TRC"
4,No Do Your Thing,This is a very good video compilation but ironically it does not have the video You Do Your Thing.The videos areDaddy Won't Sell the FarmCold One Comin' OnDidn't IMy TownHell YeahIf You Ever Stop Loving Me
4,Good read,I enjoyed this book. It followed a different story line that I found intriguing. I would recommend reading this story.
4,Great read,I really enjoyed the book and read it in almost one sitting. Reminded me of Brent Weeks Night Angel trilogy and looking forward to the sequel.
3,Why,The book is good but why do you have to put humanity in it blood I what the name is you tucked up
1,Get The Originals NOW,"Why would anyone want to waste their money or their time listening to these overwrought imitations? Hey, Leiber and Stoller are one of the top 3 songwriting teams in the HISTORY of rock (McCartney-Lennon and Holland-Dozier-Holland are the only other ones who could hold a candle), and most of their best work is available in THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. So here's a clue: start with a Drifters best-of, then move to the Coasters. Then Elvis and Ben E. King's solo stuff. If you still can't get enough (and you won't), then start looking for 50's and 60's compilations with the missing essential tracks (Kansas City,Love Potion #9, I Who Have Nothing). Do that and this CD becomes not only utterly dispensable, but an abomination to the memory of these great songs."
5,If you don't love it you don't like Great music,"I had heard many great things about this musical when it first appeared on Broadway. I had the privilege of seeing it in London in 1997 and bought the sound track as soon as I returned to the US.The audience in london was tapping toes and clapping hands from start to finish, as were myself , and my family. Even my Teenage son once he heard the soundtrack it was difficult to get it back from him. I've since seen a pay perview video and the musical again. My spouse has seen it now three times never ceases to please. The soundtrack just keeps the pleasure current. I'd listen to it until the CD Wears out if possible, and see it again and again."
3,Long time fan,"I have been with these guys since the 70's, I didn't even know they came out with a new album til last friday, so I bought it. Maurice White's voice sounds so clean, P bailey flows and hits the highs. How can you not like clean music. I am so sick of raps, that's not music! It's filthy words and it all sounds the same all the time. EWF plays real music, clean R&B. I really miss it.I like the cd but did not love it. Slow jams are great but I would have liked to have heard a little bit more of their funky uptempo stuff. The one jam out of 17 tracks is the last song ""dirty"". It is old (1978) but kind of country-funky, I really like this song and wish the cd had 3-4 more uptempo stuff like this. Over all a ""Good"" cd."
3,Pieces missing,"I'm basing this review strictly on the samples. One star for Phillip, One for Ralph Johnson, and one for the White brothers Maurice and Verdine. The two missing stars? Obviously Larry Dunn and Al McKay. Add those two missing pieces and you've got a perfect five. When those two key members of EWF left the group, they took a key part of the EWF sound and flavor with them. I like all the artist they collaborated with on this project, but as a long time EWF fan I have only one request. Please try to do a project with those two former members on the next album. Even if it's only one song a piece. The sound they contributed to EWF is on par with what Anthony Lockett did with Cameo. It just isn't the same without them in place."
4,EWF is back on track,"After waiting nearly six years I finally got my wishes fulfilled - a new EWF-record with Maurice and Phillip and the other funky guys. A very good and intelligent album that beats the s--t out of most R&B and soulrecords that are produced today. The only thing I don't like on this CD is the electronic drummachines. If there have been real accustic percussion I would give this record five stars - but its a good piece of music.Now I'm waiting for the next record. Don't let us wait to long, Maurice."
5,Love this Band,"I used to listen to this CD back in the early 2000's. Brings back memories, Loved it. Listen to it all the time."
3,"Thorough, but short-sighted conclusions","Most of the analysis and critiques of the NP on Paul is good, but I still couldn't agree with Westerholm's conclusions. I found that he does not really take the OT seriously on its own terms - he sees it purely through a Pauline lens (re: Leviticus, he says that the book is only valuable because it points to Christ and atonement; in other words, the laws meant nothing for the Israelites in the time before Christ) rather than seriously trying to see how Paul is working with the OT and the law in order to understand how Christians are now called to live because of Christ. Overall good and thorough, but if you're a New Perspectivist, you'll disagree with many parts of Westerholm's conclusions. If you're a fan of the OT, you'll be repulsed by some parts of his conclusions."
5,These are beautiful...,I bought these as a birthday gift for a friend - they are very nice quality and she LOVED them! I would recommend.
4,Gr8 product for the price,"This is a thick conditioner that has strong tea tree oil smell and 9 hours later I can still feel the tingle of the tea tree on my scalp from using this conditioner. This conditioner is paraben free which I love, but I was disappointed to learn that there was protein in this product. My hair is type 4 as I am of Afro-carribean decent and protein sensitive. I can tolerate protein well mild proteins in moderation. This product didn't turn my hair brittle and dry. It conditioned it was like I said very thick. I love the wonderful ingredients aside from the protein. I can't beat 18 oz of conditioner esp. a thick one that is 100% organic. I would recommend this product, but it isn't necessarily I practical buy since my hair is so sensitive to protein. Every use is with caution when it comes to protein and my hair. I would recommend this product to others as even with my sensitivity my hair was left soft even after the product was rinsed out and my hair dried."
4,good conditioner,I like this conditioner because it makes my hair feel soft and clean. It smells good too. I recommend this conditioner.
3,HeavenzAngel,"I received this conditioner (along with the shampoo) a week ago. Thus far, I have used them my last three hair washes.While I do notice a positive change in the texture of my hair (it is also shinier and easier to manage) there is minimal difference in my scalp condition.I have scalp psoriasis and was looking for a shampoo/conditioner that really helped minimize the itching, inflammations and flakes. So far, I have noticed little improvement in this.While I do feel some relief while I am washing my hair, since the product leaves a ""cool"" feeling on your scalp, afterwards, the itching is still there.I was hoping that by now, I would start to notice a change in this aspect. Maybe I should give it a while longer."
3,so far so good,So far there hasnt been any issues. Headers bolted on easy. The only problem was conecting to the Y pipe. Alignment was off a bit and bolted up pretty tough. Had to grind down the flanges to make and tighter fit.
1,Doesn't hold air!,"My 2 girls got this as a Christmas present & the first night they went to sleep on it, one had already gotten a leak & cried because she couldn't sleep on ""her own bed"". The other was deflated in the morning when we woke up. They didn't jump on them, either. We can't send them back because like most x-mas gifts, the boxes have been thrown out."
2,Not for the medical student,"Dale Dubin is a little too oversimplified. It takes too long to read and in the end one feels not having gathered enough. The book seems to be directed more towards paramedics.Medical students would be better of reading Hamptons ECG made easy. It is concise, yet comprehensive enough. It is easy to read and in a little over 70 pages."
5,"The Best Soulful Group Of The 70""s",When i heard the song wherever you go i had to find out whom were the artist behind this soulful sound then i was told it was Skip Mahoney and the Casuals Skip's high tenor voice was Unbelievable I tell my friends guys just dont sing like that anymore back in the 70's guys sang not sing but sang I love this CD i would tell anyone to purchase it i also love the ballard I need your love is also a wonderful song
1,Cheaply made,This tea kettle is very cheaply made and only lasted 2 weeks before it stopped working. The price was cheap and now I know why!
5,Great way to heat water quickly,"My wife and I enjoy tea quite often, and this electric kettle works very well. Don't know how long it will last, so far we're very happy."
5,toastess cordless electric kettle,"This cordless electric kettle has turned out to be very practical in design, a pleasure to use, easy to keep clean, and boils water ""bird speed"". Definitely a good buy. j. price"
1,Unsatisfied and disappointed,"I purchased the Toastess TJK-28W 1500-Watt on March, 11, 2007. Around 2 weeks ago, I started to notice that the heating element, which is asserted that ""concealed stainless-steel heating element resists corrosion"", is slightly peeling with mental-like small parcales.I think the possible reason for the peeling of heating element is that the heating element is only coated with stainless steel.I stop using it to boil my drinking water."
1,Repulsive,"This has to have been one of the worst books I've read in years. The writing was difficult to follow. The subject matter was offensive, and didn't come off as remotely funny. I was totally repulsed by this book."
5,Third Book and Getting Better all the Time,"Paul Doherty is the consummate professional when it comes to writing historical mystery novels. I for one do not know how he can be so prolific with his offering of books and yet make sure that each of them is well researched. Whether they be 13th, 14th, or fifteenth century they are always true to the period. He has also written books about Alexander the Great and is now turning his hand to novels of Ancient Egypt at the time of the most influential period in its long history.The new Pharaoh-Queen is now settled firmly on the throne of Egypt and with her adviser Amerotke by her side sets about the task of bringing her beloved land of Egypt back to some normality after the death of Tuthmosis and the consequent chaos that took over the land. But yet more trouble is round the corner as she and her adviser have to tackle a recent spate of killings. Deaths that are ascribed by many of the more superstitious people to the God of the Dead"
5,Great Classic Math Book from a Master,"This is an incredible work, painstakingly and lovingly translated by someone with more patience than I might ever have. Thank God there are people out there who can do such tedious things so we can all enjoy these great works in English. This book shows how a master thinks about mathematics. It rolls out of his head like you and I might talk about the weather. If you get but one new idea from this book, it was worth the price. Gauss' contribution of ""clock"" or modular arithmetic will change the way you think about numbers."
5,Easy install perfect fit on Epi Les Paul,I installed these on my Epiphone Les Paul Custom. The install was quick and simple. The existing screw holes were a perfect fit for Dunlop screws. I removed the original Epi LP strap Pin and reused the felt washer originally installed. I put some paraffin on the new screws before installing. The only issue was putting the strap lok onto the leather strap. My leather stap is rather thick. The tail strap fit fine but the lead strap need some minor paring of the leather in order to fit the plunger deep enough so the lock washer could be fit. All in all it only took 10 min to complete the whole installation. Just remember to keep the original screw and pins in your guitar case if you ever plan to sell your guitar.
4,"Great product, a defect with the gold version though","This product is fantastic and very much worth the money. It's easy to remove/attach a strap and it's virtually impossible for a strap to fall off during performance.However, there's a slight problem with the gold version. I'm guessing the plating is quite thin or just bad quality plating, because it oxidized within a week out of the package on the bass. Of course, this doesn't affect how well it works (it still works great), but the appearance is dull and not shiny at all (unlike when I first opened the package)."
5,Awesome Strap Locks,"These are really great strap locks, only thing that's bad about them is that the screws strips really easy. So I would strongly recommend using an electric drill to put these on. The screws go in faster & won't strip, like they would with a screwdriver. But other then that this is a really great product. Over all the strap locks tend to be very stable in holding the guitar and strap in place. I put these on all my guitars."
3,Only 3 twists to a pack!,"The product is fine, but the price is ridiculous. The description did not list how many are in a pack, but there are only 3, which means you are paying more than $3 per twist. That is insanely expensive. I can get a 6-pack of the 5 inch twists are Walgreens for $2. These are gigantic, and my dogs spent a couple hours entranced with them (the older dog actually gave up and left his for the younger dog)."
1,think twice!,"Don't buy this unless if you expect it to last beyond the 3 year warranty. All out of warranty repairs are $135. The warranty for the repair lasts a year. Mine broke, again, after the repair warranty expired. Seiko service (the only people who can fix these) wanted another $135 to fix it AGAIN. They never tell you what they fixed except ""repair movement."" The watch was never dropped or abused and had light use. For what I paid, i expected a lot better than this. You can get a lot of watches that will do the same thing as this one and are a lot more reliable and cheaper."
2,so disapointing,Well i recieved the set and was so excited about it and had been waiting for it forever!!!I noticed something was missing and i started to freak out.I opened the box hope that the item missing(A SHOVEL)had just fallen out but no...sadley there was no shovel and i was sooooo dissapointed!!!This was a complete scam and waste of moeny-(I HAD PAYED FOR A SHOVEL TOO!!!) so i recomend NEVER buting this.Of course unless you don't care about a shovel then it's a good product.Cry cry cry...
5,Easy!,First time trying this product and found the product to be simple to use with amazing results! Professional look and easy!
1,Don't bother,This was impossible to use! The dough sticks even if you flour it. You can't get the ravioli out with out tearing them up! It is easier to make them the old fashioned way! I say don't waste your money on this!
1,Norpro Ravioli Maker and Press,"I returned this product on March 3, 2011 and have sent several e-mails regarding a credit to my account but apparently they have not received my return. I can't believe that they have not received my return to date. Very discouraging! I do not think I would order from this company again."
4,better than making with hands,"This item is really good. I have it for about a year now. I make 12 raviolies in about 5-6 min.(including rolling the dough, and putting the filling) It saves a bit of time. When using the Ravioli Maker Press use plenty of flour on one side (the side that is going to end up on the maker). If you used to make raviolies by hand with the maker they sure taste different(dry)but with some experimenting you will sucseed. also roll dough a bit thicker. As far as washing I soak it in water and dough comes of easy. The product is really good. I am very happy I bought it."
3,To big,"Center diameter was to big, was planning on using the return service, seams easy enough, until I found they fit a friends car, and I like helping, so, here you go..."
2,Poor.,"I have to admit that I experienced the same thing as some of the other reviewers... at two different locations... Bought the switch, it worked great. Later, it brought the network to it's knees. Transfer rates were the equivilent of a 33.6 modem, ACROSS THE LAN. I would not recommend this product, ESPECIALLY since other people have experienced the same things. The good reviews? Perhaps they haven't had it for very long. Maybe mine was from the same bad batch."
4,"Easy, efficient and seems reliable","This purchase was to replace the same model switch. The prior one lost one port at a time and then burned out completely. I replaced it with the same model since it was most likely just a problem with that particular switch. I like Linksys products for the most part. I've had my share of problems, but I think you get that with any network equipment priced for home office consumers. My replacement switch has worked flawlessly for the better part of 4 months and I would recommend it to the average user for their home networks."
2,works well while it lasts -- but don't count on long life,"I've had two Linksys products die on me shortly after a year (a 4-port router/switch, and now this 8-port switch). It works fine until it dies (but that's like saying a stapler staples correctly: it's supposed to).Just to note: I run them in a very friendly environment -- no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem. (Also, you can count me as an ""expert user"".)I myself will never buy another Linksys product again -- I'll try out Netgear & DLink and other brands, but goodbye Cisco/Linksys. If you chooose to try their products, caveat emptor."
5,Great device for my home network,"I wanted to replace my old 8-port switch, where I had my motorola cable modem, my server and my Linksys Wireless Router. Worked great as soon as I hooked up.Smaller than the switch I had, and design and color match my WRT54G.Wanted this model, and Amazon got the best price. Can't complain."
5,Product works great,This product was purchased to expand my home network. My other switches are this model of Linksys and have served me flawlessly for several years. This one is started on the same path. Good dependable product from a good seller
3,Red Color is Actually Maroon,"I ordered this lunchbox in red, but the color I received was actually a dark maroon.Other than color, the lunchbox is great. It's easy to clean, made of durable material, and it's large. For example, it can hold 2 small tupperware containers for soup and sandwich, a yogurt, bags of carrots, celery, nuts, and a small apple. The extra pocket is nice for holding napkins, silverware, and condiment packets.Unfortunately, my boyfriend will be the primary user of the lunchbox, because the maroon color does not look good with my red coat."
3,For The VERY Serious Horse Racing Fan,"I was disappointed to discover that in this 448 page book, approximately 290 pages are devoted to thousands of lines of statistical data. It was not what I expected. The history of the sport is arranged in a time line format with a story on each decade from the 1890s to 2004, each chapter followed by 30 or more pages of statistics. I am not a horse racing fan but I did find this book enlightening. What I learned is that horse racing is really all about the breeding and the money. I found this very sad, especially in light of the recent tragic deaths of Barbaro and Eight Belles."
2,WHATT happend at the end?,"I was worried the while time that this movie had enough budget to show bank scene, it kind did with cheap fireworks towards the end. But it seems like they run out of film to cut so ended up not seeing what happened to Kianu and the bad guy in the hole. I'm not satisfied."
4,"Chekov would approve this story, too","Keanu Reeve's underhanded performance coupled with James Caan's heavyhanded acting balance the mighty talent who is Vera Farmiga.This is really a very entertaining story, acted so well by the said actors.It's a story of someone who does time for a crime he hasn't committed, and then goes and does the crime. Love the assonance throughout the movie--soothing.Farmiga plays cold, cold characters...this one's no exception. Reeves' character falls in love with her. It's like watching two icicles loving each other and that's amusing really, for love deserves such melting farce. But Reeves can never really play characters capable of loving with any amount of warmth above a kelvin; nor do we want him to, because that would damage the persona we've come to know his characters by.This story belongs to dark comedy story telling, and a good one at that."
2,Elfman vs. Goldenthal and Elfman wins!,"I bought this cd for two reasons: 1. I collect all superhero music; 2. I liked the Two-Face theme. However, Goldenthal is all wrong for Batman! His music is always on the technical side and doesn't actually try to understand the characters, but is just weird for weirdness' sake. Elfman always writes his music with the emotions of the characters in mind, something Goldenthal doesn't even seem to care about. His Batman theme is too campy(with the exception of the first track which is pretty good, but not great,) the Riddler music is just plain annoying, His circus music is woefully inadequate, and his action music is all noise and no substance( even Elfman's noisy cues contain substance!). The Two-Face music is the most interesting theme on this cd even though it is a little silly for a disfigured and brooding character. If you want good superhero music, check out Batman, Batman Returns, or either Spiderman scores, coincidentally all Elfman!"
2,"Bombastic, overdone score that is unenjoyable.","A follow up to Batman Returns, Batman Forever is the first score written by Elliot Goldenthal who begins with a decent main theme that gets lost in bombastic rattles and clangs. Sometimes this score sounds more like a dryer full of quarters set on tumble. Overall I don't believe that this is a very good score and since I own over 350 of them, I speak with some authority."
4,Great for File and Internet Sharing!,"I borrowed this product from a friend and it worked great, for file sharing. Do not buy if you want speeds of 100mbps. For internet sharing you have to use Windows ICS which is a pain to install, but when done right works great. (ICS is not the hub's fault, if you don't know how to use it buy a router!) I liked it but I had to give it back."
2,shoddy,"One would expect more from Harold Bloom, whose superb 'Shakespeare Invention of the Human' is such a marvellous collection of essays. While I appreciate the task of being an editor is different, I'm astonished that Prof. Bloom cannot find one piece of Tolkien criticism written more recently than 1983! Before today's college freshmen were born...!Perhaps this book was a little hastily thrown together, but I can't help feeling that serious students of Tolkien will feel ripped off--and better off going to their college library for current critical studies. I fully expected to see, for example, a selection from Norman Cantor's superb ""Inventing the Middle Ages"", whose chapter on Tolkien gives an historian's interesting perspective on why, contra Bloom, the Lord of the Rings will take its place in the pantheon of great works of the 20th century (""aesthetic reservations"" be damned).Anyway, its the lack of recent pieces like Cantor's that makes Prof. Bloom's book such a disappointment...."
3,Beautiful but not as described,"The pendant is gorgeous, but the chain is a cheap non - silver necklace, so drop it and just take the pendant.N."
3,hmmmm........,i bought this necklace a week ago and it just reached todaythe pendant is very cutei was slightly disappointed since it looked way better in the picture (the red color on da roses are pretty light compared to the picture. u can barely see it)the gift box is smaller than i expectedthe quality of the chain is very cheapall in all it isn't that bad but i suggest that people should prepare a back up chain for the pendant
3,Was Decent,"Bought this for my mom once, and to be honest she didn't seem to liek it. It was made pretty cheaply as well. But it did come in a cool little box."
1,It broke!,"This necklace broke imediately! It came with a chain I didnt wanted so I tried to unhook the pendant from the chain and then the ""ring"" which was attached to the pendant broke! So now I have to forget about it or pay even more money and wait longer for it to be fixed at a smith! Very bad!Otherwise beautiful piece."
5,Highly recommend,This item arrived promptly. My husband and I installed it in a very short time. I am very pleased with the look and also how much space was freed up in my cabinets. I have no idea why I waited so long to purchase one.
5,Looked 4-ever,"I looked around all the stores and on-line resources for what seemed like forever.I thought this was too good to be true. however, the great price is just a bonus to this perfect pot rack.the size, the ease of installation, the included hooks, the fact that i now have cabinet space; all this = 5 stars!!!"
5,What do you do if you don't have studs above your kitchen?,"What do you do if you don't have studs above your kitchen?I didn't have studs in my kitchen ceiling where it would make sense for the pot rack to be. My only options were to return it to Amazon or secure it to the sheet rock that makes my ceiling. I bought some toggle anchors that fit the hooks that come with this. It worked like a charm, and it could theoretically hold 200lbs, but I'm not about to try that :PAnyway, I was worried at first that it may break under the weight of the pans. So I increased the load of pans a few at a time, and I'm proud to say that I have some heavy pans hanging from it and big pots sitting on the rack above it. Works fine now. I put a link for the type of toggle bolt I used. You could easily buy them at your local hardware store where they will sell them individually. This comes in a pack of 10, and you only need 4.Itw Brands 10Pk Dry Toggle Bolt 25220 Anchors Hollow Wall Expansion"
5,Great product!! Great Price!!,"I was a little skeptical about buying this pot rack because like the old saying goes you usually get what you pay for and this pot rack is extremly cheap in price compared to many of the others out there. But once it arrived I was pleasantly surprised, its very durable, looks very nice and was easy to hang.. I have many heavy pots and pans (I'm actually over the limit in weight it recommends) and have had no problems whatsoever, of course make sure you hang the hooks in a joist (wood), do not take shortcuts and anchor into plaster or drywall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a pot rack.."
4,pot rack,This pot rack holds all my pots & pans well. It was nice to get my storage shelfs back to use for other things. I live in a small apt. & storage is at a premium. And with all my pans out in full view I use more of them instead of the one that just happens to be out. Also the price didn't break the bank and it was not to hard to install. (4 stars)
4,Solid,"This product was simple to install, it worked perfectly with the limited amount of space that I had, and it looks fairly good. I would purchase again."
5,Perfect Pot Rack!,"I love this pot rack - it looks so much more expensive than even ones that cost twice as much, and it is perfect for our more modern kitchen. Great deal!"
5,"Styilish, Good Quality, Excellent Price","This pot rack was exactly what I'd been looking for. Installation wasn't too difficult, and the chains are long enough, even though I have a rather high ceiling. Several people have complimented it, and I've only had it up for a few weeks. It holds the weight of my 10 pots and pans easily."
5,Works Great/IT,"Use this in my dorm room to allow multiple connections to run from one internet port, works great on the Xbox 360, PC, and multiple laptops with no latency (slowing)."
1,Customer Service? What's that?,"If you buy this product you better pray it works. I purchased this product and it didn't work, sent it back to Amazon to get replaced. Then it still didn't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasn't, and that this is the 2nd 'faulty' switch. However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them. I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number isn't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product, I hope it works for you. But if you think you might need some service from the company, you may want to think about going to a competitor (are there any in this price range?)."
4,Much faster,I have a Cisco 677 DSL Router acting as a DSL modem to my house. I initially hooked up a Linksys BEFSR41 Cable/DSL Router/Firewall but it bogged down the internet connection for the two computers connected. I then found out that my DSL modem (the Cisco) was also a Router. I replaced the BEFSR41 with this EZXS55W Switch as I figured that I didn't need two routers in line (though I lost the firewall in the process.) Result: both computers now have a much faster connection to the internet! I frequently use both computers simultaneously for internet gaming requiring high bandwidth and this box seems to get the job done just fine. Setup involved plugging it in and booting up the two PCs. Nice!
5,easy to use,"Haveing multiple computers and a cable modem, this switch work wonderfuly. Plus it is small, it is tucked away but still easy to get at. And I have never had any problems with speed or losing connections. I was hesitate to try this switch because a friend had difficulties with a Linksys product, but I have actually enjoyed this switch more then i expected."
2,Not a Fan,"I've never been a Sheena Easton fan. I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. His report was lukewarm - a few hits, but lots of unfamiliar, medicore filler, he said. Not recommended."
4,"Great episodes, but repeat music","This season 1 set contains 3 DVDs with a total of 20 full episodes. The only drawback is that they use the same song at the beginning and end of the episodes for several episodes in a row. So, even though the episodes are different, we find ourselves fastforwarding through the songs at the beginning and end so we don't have to hear the same song 10 times in a row. Other than that, it's a great set."
3,"Love Hi-5, but DVD recording quality is BAD.","My little guy loves Hi-5 so he loves the DVD. I hate to give them a 3 star, but the DVD quality is really bad. The sound volume goes up and down throughout most of the songs, it's REALLY annoying. We checked our sound system and it's working fine with all other DVD's. It's really bad in the main song at the beginning and end of the shows. Since my son is only 14 months he doesn't notice it, but for the price we paid for the DVD I would have hoped for a better quality recording. I agree with the other posts too, I think there are some episodes missing and the menu options are not that detailed. I will probably have to return it, the sound going up and down constantly is horrible."
4,Not too excited,"I bought this for 2010 Chevy Suburban 1500. This is my third Westin Sportsman guard, the last one was on 2000 Suburban. Product quality, dimensions, solid feel, powder coated finish, easiness of installation, packaging are all good, no complaints there. I took one star off for a couple of reasons. First, when installed, I can not see this brush guard from anywhere inside the truck. On my other trucks, I could see the center raised bar (as well as the corners) from the driver position, helping me judge where the front of the car is when pulling up close to something. With this one, I already touched a wall couple of times in a parking garage. Second, design wise, I think that the vertical bars are more ""fat"" than they need to be, sticking at least 2"" further forward than necessary. Fit looks a bit generic - I can not say that this guard follows any design and styling features of the front of the truck very closely."
2,Just didn't get it!,"This seems to be a book mainly about a ""nonrelationship"" between a manly driving instructor and a very girly middle aged woman. Some of the car information is mildly interesting, but the endless analysis of their lack of a real relationship is just plain boring. It is also difficult to understand how the mother of a nine year old would be willing to risk her life on the back of a motorcycle. Guess it takes all kinds!"
5,One of my favorites,Owned this on vinyl years ago and am thrilled to have iton my mp3 player now. Its every bit as good as I remembered.
5,Dylan,I had an vinyl copy of this album. It was one of my favorites. The record had become scratchy plus my old turn table was not compatible with my equipment. When I saw the the album on amazon at a great price I jumped on it. I am now once again enjoying the songs.
5,What a great book for so little money,I have never purchased any reference work of such exquisite quality for such a small price. Two thousand years of history of the Holy See within anybody's reach. Highest quality research. No hagiographies but merely a stating of historical facts. This book is truly a great treasure to me.
4,monkey king,I waiting a long time to read this book imswr very interested in Chinese mythology so far I have enjoyed the story..thank you Amazon for your prompt service I also have a kindle fire wihich I also enjoy very much!!!!
1,leaks,"I purchased this pan for elderly mom, she informed me, that when she made an upside down pineapple cake, that when baked, it leaked in her oven. Where she than had a mess to clean in her oven, She said she didn't use a cookie sheet, but she should of. No cookies sheets shouldn't be required when baking cakes."
4,fish n chips,"fish, fish, fish, and chips! this is one interesting joint venture to say the least! leftover crack and their masterful lyrics on one half including covers of two subhumans songs added a nice touch to this cd. and of course dick lucas, jasper and company doing what they do as always, formulating the sounds of old school punk rock and ska music in their own style. brilliant."
5,The unmagnificent lives of adults...,"Patience is a virtue when listening to Boxer, the exquisite new album by outstanding Brooklyn-based artists The National. Anyone familiar with their last album, Alligator, might be surprised by its lack of what the Onion referred to as ""controlled-detonation rockers."" What it does have is excellent tunes, tight musicianship, strange, witty lyrics and the incomparably gorgeous voice of Matt Berninger. Every listening reveals more subtle touches that add up to what I consider the album of the year (in a year with many, many outstanding albums.) It's also an album that deserves to be listened to as a whole every time, as the sequencing of the songs is perfectly done. Standout tunes for me are the lovely, romantic ""Apartment Story,"" the '80s-sounding (in the best possible way) ""Brainy,"" album opener ""Fake Empire..."" If I go on, I'll have listed every track on the album. I can't stop playing it. It's that good. Buy it now."
3,pleasurable,"Boxer is one of those albums that's perfect for background music, and every so often you'll hum some of the vocal melodies, but the album overall is honestly not NEARLY as memorable as the 80-plus reviews here will have you believe.The lead singer rarely (if ever) branches beyond that ""calmly pleasant"" vocal style and presents listeners with vocal melodies that are average at best. I believe the singer was influenced by Bruce Springsteen's early work, or perhaps Bob Dylan's early work for that matter but lacks the charisma to stand out. I hear a slightly similar sound in his voice to these two legendary artists. He's not bad of course, and the band isn't awful either. Far from it.Still, after several listens, ""Gospel"" is the only song that really connects with me. The rest is just pleasant filler. You'll probably like it more than I do."
4,Another National Achievement,"The National has released yet another captivating and expressive album that makes my top 4 of the year. The Boxer is more intimate and softer in comparison to The Alligator. But don't let that deter you from listening, because what it lacks in bang, it makes up for in depth with many subtle layers of instrumental and sounds. After listening and concentrating on this album 4-5 times, you will notice all the additions that make this album feel whole. The lyrics are still dynamic and flow so perfectly with his style of singing. I really do commend The National on this album!If you have not yet heard The Alligator, make it a priority!!!"
4,Out of print - great find,"I was happy to find this CD on Amazon because it went out of print years ago. I had a copy years ago and am not sure what happened to it. Smile was a relatively unknown grunge-punk garage band that had two singles that were occasionally played on the radio in Southern California: ""Rock Anthem for the Retarded Teenage Hipster Population"" and ""Staring at the Sun"". Staring at the Sun, in particular, is sort of an unknown 90s alt-rock classic. Overall this album is fairly weak in the songwriting department with only a few truly great songs, but the performances are energetic and guitar tones are thick and crunchy. I recommend this to fans of 90s grunge, punk, and power-pop bands like Silverchair, Bush, Sponge, and the Offspring."
1,Useless,"Not a good buy. Full of trivial info. Looks like I paid for only 10-12 pointers I picked up from this thick book. This book is probably useful for HP UX System admins, but that too is limited to first 2-3 chap.OReilley's book on System Admin is a better choice with some HP manuals."
3,Good Buy,"This is a good keyboard for this price. The main con is that it has only 37 keys. It would be better if it had more. Makes a great Christmas presnt for an aspiring pianist, or any child/teen who enjoys music."
4,good keyboard bad adapter,The keyboard is great. The adapter sold by Toysrus is the wrong one. Toysrus should have contacted all of the customers whom have been inconvienced by their error.
1,LINKSYS 5 PORT HUB,"As I recall this is the item that you cancelled the order on. I did secure an 8 port model which works just fine, but of course I never received a 5 port model which is more feasible to use/sell.Thanks anyhow.Bob B"
4,EndNote ROCKS!,"I am a graduate student and I find that the EndNote product is INVALUABLE for references in papers and reports. This program magically locates all of your references and orders them at the end of your report. If you need to change the format of your references or citation markers it will do that for you in a blink of an eye. The only problem is that EndNote 3 was uncompatible with Office XP, and thus I have to upgrade to a newer version. If you run Office XP you should get this version."
4,"good product, but this is NOT the current edition","EndNote is an excellent product and widely used by researchers and medical writers. However, the buyer should be aware this is version V6, and NOT X6. Many users of EndNote recommend one buy the current edition as it contains features they find useful.CSmartphysician and medical writer"
4,A near perfect starter kit,"I bought this kit to connect two computers (one running Win2k the other running Win 98) and ADSL internet connection.When I got it, i opened it up, and was surprised to see it came with Descent 3, detailed manuals for easy installation. But no Win2k drivers included, no problem though I went to there web site and downloaded them in seconds. Installing the NIC in the Win2k system was a breeze. The problem came the my Win98 unit but not because it was Win98 but because it had a AMD chip. After fixing that problem (PCI/IRQ Steering with AMD as stated in the NIC manual if you search) Everything went smooth and can be.I would have given 5 stars it the AMD problem was more than just a foot note in the manual. All and all one great networking kit at a good price that will allow me to add more computer later.I transfered a 214 meg file in 1:36 (2255.7 kB/Sec Avg 3191.7kB/Sec max)"
5,just fantastic,action was great. loved it all.would watch it again any time. good entertainment for all ages over ten years oif age..
2,Couldn't take it,"I never found out if this would work for me or not. I was into about 4-5 days of taking it and my IBS started acting up, so had to stop. The fact that my daughter was also taking a similar product in this line, and also suffers from IBS, had the same reaction; we both concluded it was something in the formulas. So I'll never know if this would have helped or not. I would just caution if you also suffer from IBS, that you proceed carefully and make note if you get a similar reaction. From the other reviews here, it sounds like this is a very good product and wished I couldve taken it long enough to see a result."
5,Dylan's best,"This is,in my opinion, Dylan's best album. All the songs are great, good passion, and understandable lyrics."
3,Pleased,I am happy to have the songs I lost when the original album was damaged. This CD like any other has good and not so good songs which depends on the listeners preference. It contains some hard to find songs that make it well worth the purchase for hard core and moderate Bob Dylan fans.
2,Dylan's Worst Album,"Dylan catches lots of grief about his albums of the 80s but this could be his worst of all. BORING-BORING-BORING!!!! Oh Sister, One More Cup of Coffee, Isis, Sara, Joey are all terrible. Hurricane starts it out ok but the rest of this stuff is AWFUL!!! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Glad he came back strong with Street Legal."
4,A long time Halflife Fan...,"First off... People need to read system requirements on the boxes of games, and or do more research.Second the game is phenominal. I have a simple Dell 4600... Except for a better graphics card (a wimpy 256 MB Radeon 9550)everything on my computer is stock. The game itself is great and because I owned the first halflife I already had a Steam account which makes things much easier.Strengths: The games graphics, AI, storyline and flow are all great. Water looks real (literally real) Characters move and speak fluidly. The AI enemies think and engage together. The storyline is interesting and the game overall plays fine.Weakness: The Loading Times... The loading times for me are normally 1-2 minutes for the next area to load. I'm simply going to buy some RAM to help this.Overall: Buy it if you don't have a crappy computer. :)"
1,Very close...almost too good to be true.,"Right off the bat I've never, EVER, heard of this game at all! What's up with that? After playing the original, which is great(back in 98), I was so ready to get that sequal. Who can deny the chaos that's going to come when it comes out?! I'm not sure if it will suceed over the original but who knows? I'll tell you... only Valve knows these answers and their keeping it as a suprise. I HATE SUPRISES!!! Oh sure they've gave out hints and treats but that isn't enough for an enthusiest like me! So... if anyone knows, TRUELY knows, when this game is coming please tell me! I've got to know if it will work on my computer."
4,Hoping for the best...,"Aaaah... What a magicall year for gamers. Quake 4 announced, Doom III & Half-Life 2 on the way, and Duke Forever... uhm... well... Half-Life being one of the best games ever to take place on mine and any others hard-drives was bound to a sequel. But, what will we recive? One thing is certain, the game will be powered by one of the wildest graphics engines ever. Visuals only seen in movies, sound effects to droll for, kick-ass much environment interactivity... But... Can Valve keep up with the success of the original? Only time will see..."
1,WARNING,WARNING: It's only the disks and does not have the online code required to actually play it. You'll have to buy an online code separately to play this game.
3,"Good game, copyright dimishes experience","I am a longtime gamer, I had a pong console if it gives you some idea of how longtime.I played Half-life when it first came out and loved it. I really like this game as well, but the copyright protection really detracts form the experience. I open Steam and wait for it to do all the things it needs to do. Wait wait wait. 5-7 minutes as I time it. sometimes more. Far Cry was as impressive and didn't treat me like a ""perp"" every time I wanted to play it.I know Piracy is an issue, but this is not the solution.Game is good and worthwhile-I got the collectors edition. Don't. The Book is useless, the half life one and counter strike are available elsewhere. The Tee-shirt is pretty nice though.Overall the game developer did an outstanding job-whoever came up with the copyright protecvtion screwed you guys."
5,The Best Game around,There is nothing bad to say about this game. It has it all!!!Continueing in the tradition of Half Life. Half Life 2 is a sequel that should not be passed by. A must for all shooters!!!!
3,Don't Stand For This!,"If you've experienced the kind of installation and registration frustrations that others have, regardless of what you think of the game itself, complain to the makers themselves and make it clear that you're not happy with this kind of treatment.I can understand the makers of these games wanting to protect their product, but this is treating their customers like criminals from the get go. As one reviewer quite correctly pointed out, ALL games will go this way if we allow them to. I've played games twice as enjoyable as this, and there is very little or no protection on those. What a way to treat loyal customers!Buy DEVASTATION instead - Half-Life 2 is a rip-off of this game, and you can use it on a spare machine without the cyber cops cutting your hands off."
5,Awesome..graphics and gameplay,"Incredible graphics! The gameplay is awesome and the attention to detail is impressive. Not to mention that after you enjoy half-life 2 a bit, you can then play counter-strike which is another great game altogether. Two awesome games for the price of one...you can't lose. Some advice on installation...if u have zonealarm firewall you may need to turn it off when first installing and at first launch of the game."
3,HL is the greatest game ever.,"I was fiends with a guy who had teh source code cuz he bought it off ebay for a package of skittles and some money. I then used busy-as-usual basic to write hacks for teh game, so when it comes out I will always win. I tehn used jabba-scribt to preload the AI which I now use to power teh internet. I got to the end when this big ape came out and tuched me, so gordon shouted no bad tuch bad tuch bad tuch. Dis game could have ben great but the valve computers in FRANCE where hacked by JEFFK!!! who tehn went to Jerry's house for some pie. Also open eh consold and type ""say allboys"" to get michael jackson mode. It takes you tot eh secret neverland level where you have to save mickaly colkin from the evil flying glove."
1,"dude, this sucks","hey all. i just thought i'd add my say, being an amateur computer user, instead of any of these clever computer experts.frankly, i'm annoyed. i think that valve's paranoia about half life 2 being cracked and modded etc is OTT. they have to come to accept that, no matter what they do, someone who is cleverer than them WILL take it to pieces.i also agree with some of the other reviewers; that the enthusiasm for the game is dwindling now. i don't believe that that will mean that when the game is FINALLY released that the sales won't be phenominal, far from it. i just feel that valve have fallen flat on their face while trying to find the opportune moment.hell; i'm still going to buy it. if it ever gets to england. which is.... likely but probably quite a lot later than america.oh yeah, and to the guys that thought it might be fun/useful/profitable to hack valve and steal early source code, bringing the date back further, cheers. not."
1,i wish i could give it minus a gazillion,this game sucks. i liked the first one a lot. this one has no online. uh oh big mistake. valve has done counterstrike source which is a [...] times better. dont get this game. doom 3 and halo 2 are much better than this crap.
3,Half-Life. Half-Good.,"The game is not bad in itself, it has great graphics for one, the storyline is also kind of entertaining. However there are two big problems with HL2:-The game has to be registered and activated online with Steam *before you can even begin to play*. No internet, no HL2. A very long process. After you have done that, the game expects you to play online (even though it is a single-player game). There is an option to play offline, but it is somewhat difficult to activate and even then the game regularly tries to connect.-The game has a bug generally called ""stuttering"". Very frequently the game hangs for a few seconds, while the audio goes like ""It's Freeman/Freeman/Freeman/Freeman/Freeman"". The problem is not related to performance, even powerhorse PC's have it, and no solution is in sight (Valve does not seem very interested in fixing it)."
3,DON'T GET THIS GAME .... YET,OK here's the deal folks. HL2 is an incredible game no doubt about it. It's physics engine Havok is simply amazing BUT they fall short in the customer service area. talking to them is incredibly difficult. I would strongly recommend waiting to get this game till the first patch is released. You will likely have problems and getting help with your problems is simply too big a pain.
2,Realy frustrating experience,I just can believe that some people can give this Game aFive Stars.C'mon can't belive that your Dream Sequal of HalfLife 1 i'snt that good.STEAM sucks ;and that's a FACT.Ijust can stand to wait and wait when STEAM let me play theGAME.VAlve you just make a mess getting this intrusivesoftware.The mother of all annoyance...
1,What a POS,"Save your money. If you think you own this game after you pay your $50 think again. You will always have to get permission from ""Big Brother"" Steam to play. The game comes with NO instructions and support is worthless. If the $50 is really burning a hole in your pocket, go outside and do just that, burn it, you'll get more that then you will dealing with Steam."
5,Best game of all time!!!,"The graphics are great, but what really makes this game a classic is the gameplay.One issue mentioned by previous reviewers is that it is too easy; it certainly is a lot easier than ""far cry"" which I played at one of the easiest levels. By contrast, on HL2the ""hard"" level is perfect for me despite the fact that I am a below-average gamer.Before it arrived, I was worried about the internet connection issue people have mentioned in earlier reviews, as I only have a slow dialup through my university. But you only need the internet connection to set it up the first time (which took an hour an a half or so). After that you simply play in ""offline mode""."
5,Great Game For HL Lovers and Newbies,"Being a huge fan of the HL series from inception, I was more excited than Mick Jagger at a fashion show. Despite the monster install session (1 Hour) and Valve's Steam engine annoyances I got it all up and running and I quickly got thrown into the best 1st person shooter I have ever seen. Game play is intense, story line compelling, and the physics engine is a blast since you can pick up, throw, and shoot just about anything with real world like consequences. And the Gravity Gun. Come on! I wish I had one of those to use around the office.If you claim to be a gamer you will be a hack if this isn't in your pantheon of fine games. Word!"
5,Very good Mr. Freeman!,"Ever since I first Slumped the Specimine into the the anti-Mass Spetromitor in the first game. I've been addicted to Half-life. and found that leaving me with more questions then answers worked when this game first came out.I was ungry for more! and more is just what I got... More action, More cool weapons to play with, and yes... More Questions then answers.But this time around. the characters and allies in the game tore my heart out and tugged on them so hard tat i emotionally connected to teir plights. Then again their rebal AI was pretty bad. I ended up not caring if the NPC folled me or not and if they did, I tended to lead them into a mine field or two before I did anything more important later.Still the game was fun fast and action packed. I loved swinging the Crowbar once more and a new gagit like the gravity gun was great too."
2,Boring.....,"I am very much into good health and buying healthy products, but this book could not get my attention long enough to find out if it is any good. I finally gave up."
4,Must get one of these.,"If you are going to move your Ps2 anywere, no matter how often, you gotta get one of these to keep it safe. I found it can hold the Ps2, 4 controllers and a multitap, RF adapter, Power cable, Memory cards, and about 2 games. You should get a DVD carrying case as well, if you ever plan on owning more than 2 games. Other than that one problem, this is a very good quality and very useful carrying case. Well worth the money."
5,If you transport your system this is a must,"The Playstation 2 is a very fragile peice of equiptment. You need a padded case to transport it. One little slip of the hand and your system is broken. Take my advice and buy one of these. If you don't plan on moving your system at all, then you don't need it."
4,who would have imagined?,"Indeed, who COULD have imagined that Bill Drummond, co-founder of the KLF, would be the last true beat writer? Although not as well authored as, say, Burroughs, Kerouac, or Thompson, the book does cover a lot of existential ground. Drummond's logs throughout Z's and Gimpo's ramblings serve as treatises of reality, sort of olive branches offered to a reader trapped in the creative unapologetic word vortex. There's lots of violence, drugs, sex, and certainly lots of filler. The book is a heavy read, not the kind of adventure one feels the urge to digest in one sitting. I enjoyed the open-ended writing style. One word of warning though, the book makes many (albeit often subtle) references to its prequel, Bad Wisdom. What will that curmudgeon Drummond and his pesky cronies be up to next time? Perhaps a recovery mission for a certain box of hidden money in a place which smells of sulfur? ;)"
2,Made in China,"My dog loves the sweet potato chicken wraps which is why I was so disappointed when I read i tiny letters on the back ""made in China"". Although this company as not been recalled to the best of my knowledge I'm not willing to risk giving my dog any treat made in China."
1,Super lame,"would ov been fun if it worked. Would not load once in the dreamcast just acts like its not a game disc. Pretty upsetting, I was waiting to play this game for awhile ...to bad, disapointed."
3,Not very user friendly,"I'd like to preface this by stating that my 6-year-old and I only spent a (frustrating) hour with the Dinosaurs and Solar System CDs, so my opinion may change after more time spent with them and the Earth CD. So far, we love the graphics, sound and the few activities we were able to find. However, the software doesn't appear to be very user-friendly and we are having difficulty determining what activities are available and how to access them. There is no main menu to show you how to navigate through the CD and many of the screens do not feature an ""Exit"" icon to allow you to exit the program or return to the main menu.We are very PC-savvy and use other computer games/activities. I wonder if we're overlooking something obvious here. Does anyone have any advice on this CD set? We enjoy the cartoon and would love to have the CDs supplement it."
1,Tripe,"I found this book to be poorly written with no insight. The anonymous writer has written a story that careens from one extreme to another with little thought or insight to how her situation occurs. She asks questions about her life and family without ever answering them making the reader wonder what the point, if any,there is to the story.Though this is heavily promoted on the Internet, I was never able to find any information backing up ""Jill's"" story making me wonder just how much is factual."
1,Lame !,"Could have been a good story in the hands of a capable writer.As it is, the book poorly represents the experiences of abuse and should never have gone to print. What a waste. And what's with the pathetic attempts to promote the book via the internet and flyers on walls ? Please give it up for the sake of all that is good in the world."
5,nice,"Husband put it together rather fast..However, he was not satisfied with the screws they sent to hang the rack up with. So we went to Home Depo, and bought screws he felt where strong enough to hold the weight of the rack plus my heavy calphalon pots and pans."
5,Awsome!,I love this saddle. It fits the traditinal horses absolutley perfect! The stirrp leathers will fall of if you pull hard on them so be careful. If you work hard enough you can get them back on.(I got mine back on)
5,John West Peppered Mackerel in sunflower oil.,This John West Peppered Mackerel is better than the Smoked Mackerel from the East coast - in our honest opinion.
1,Dongle hell,"This dongle is complete ..., It'll break in no time. Worst off, once it breaks (and it will break) you have to deal with linksys horrible customer service. I would not recommend any linksys products to anyone, and would rather advise everyone to avoid them at all cost."
1,Wow.,"I usually keep my opinions to myself when it comes to matters of personal taste, but I'm having a hard time seeing how all these reviews can be so glowing. This book is unreadable. I managed 100 pages before I had to put it down. Obviously, I'm not the target audience for this type of story (even though I thought I was), but I can't even assume there was an editor involved here. Someone compared it to Lovecraft, and I'm thinking Britney Spears is the next Aretha Franklin. I don't want to be rude, or entirely negative, so I will say that the writer has a good imagination. The premise of the story is a good one. It's the delivery that falls short. Oh well, I guess you can't please everybody."
4,A good collection of up-to-date Slav games,This book is useful to provide an overview over the currently played lines in the Slav defence. Most of the games are taken from recent tournaments featuring some of the strongest grandmasters. At the end of each chapter a nice summary of one page is given. While the main lines are explained quite thoroughly others e.g. the Smyslow variation are treated on a lower level. It has to be pointed out that this book doesn't provide a complete coverage of the Slav theory. Therefore a tournament or correspondence player will need additional sources of information.
2,Won't fit with LCD,"If you are planing to use this case to carry your PS1 LCD combo be warned. The combination will not fit in the front pouch. You have to use the back pouch that is bigger. The back pouch is supposed to be used for cables and controllers, but if you want to use the LCD with you PS1 you have to put It in the back. Then you have to put your cables in the front pouch. The front can comfortably hold the car adapter, and if you really cram it in, the AC adapter. This leaves you carrying the bag with your controller in your hand. Disappointing."
1,wrong item sent,"the wrong item was mailed to me (a non-branded cartidge), and i still have not received a refund after returning the item almost two weeks ago."
5,Sparkly!,"My husband got me this chain for Christmas, and I love it! The twist in the chain gives it a very sparkly look as light moves across it. The 20"" length is perfect for showing off a pendant. It's also quite strong and the clasp is secure."
4,Bipolar for Smashmouth,"This album is different from the stylistic neo-60's mutant steadyness of Astrolounge and skacore influence of their rags to riches debut ""Fu shu mang"". My favourite is the song ""disenchanted"", an unusually jazzier tune that I would recommend for any fan of Miles Davis, Charlie Parker or Nat King Cole. I still like the typical feel-good SM songs like ""Holiday in my head"" and the poking fun at eitism in ""The In-Set"". I've always liked the Space-age lyrical metaphores and the whole ""Jetsons"" feel to what these guys do. There's only one incredibly boring song in the album (track #2). I'm not much of a consumer of pop bands that are pimped by big business, but I still recommend the few and far between that I consider to be islands of talent in a sea of overpromoted crap. Smashmouth has been one of those bands."
3,What happened?,I really idn't like this cd that much...i was hoping it would be like FYM but they just got 60's or something...s#*t
4,Best Smash Moth CD out,"This is so far the absolute best CD from Smash Mouth yet. After their sucsess with Allstar in so many soundtracks such as Mystery Men, Shreck, etc. Alter losing Drummer Kevin Coleman and Getting Drummer Michael Urbano ( who I think is better). How could this CD Be bad with songs such as Holday In My head and Sister Psychic? I give this cd a 4 out of 5"
3,So?,"Seriously, has anyone else noticed that all Smash Mouth's songs sound the same? I mean, they're okay songs, but they all sound the same! I definately wouldn't be able to say Smash Mouth has matured any in later albums, because they're still singing the same stuff they were in the beginning. In my opinion, the songs don't vary much at all, it's like listening to the same song slightly remixed over and over.I don't know about this album. I'm not completely sure how the songs sound. But I do know all Smash Mouth's hits are feel-good rock songs. And the guys in Smash Mouth look like they're about thirty or forty.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
2,Don't Like It Due To Personal Preference,"I couldn't read into many pages before giving it up. The reason isn't largely due to authors' interpretations of Tao Te Jing, but due to the mystery of authors' choice of this version of Chinese script. The more widely used version is simpler with less noise words. After reading so many ""&#20846;(xi)"" and ""&#20063;(ye),"" I simply just quit."
4,Well Worth It !,We had these programs up and running on our computer less than a half hour after they were delivered. They were easy to install and are easy to use. The material is interesting and educational. My kids are having lots of fun using them. We would definitely consider purchasing more Magic School Bus software. These are every bit as good as the TV programs.
5,Fun!,"This is my first didgeridoo. I've only had it a few hours and haven't set it down yet. I got the drone tone down, but the circular breathing is a little difficult. It sounds awesome and its easy to manipulate the sound. The bag it came with is very nice. I am very pleased with this purchase, which arrived two days after I placed the order. Excellent product, excellent service!!"
5,Very pleased with this kettle,"The Toastess TJK-55 is a well designed kettle that works very nicely. Others have lids which are so tight you cannot open them, this one closes tightly but is still easy enough to open for filling. It heats water quickly and pours well. Ours gets used at least twice a day and it is a pleasure to use it."
4,Not bad but there is an issue...,"This gave me access to the network for my older laptop. The only issue I've found is that the cable connection to the card is very fragile, and easily broken. I had the card about 2 months before it was rendered irritatingly inconsistant due to a connection problem between the card and cable. I would recommend being very careful with this product."
4,A great product for win2000 laptop but with a small drv prob,"I'v bought this card 18 month ago and it is still a great and fast product. I use it on a Toshiba 4000CDT with Windows 2000 Professional installed. I use hibernation and go off and on the network. The only problem which I came across and I think is driver related is that when I hibernate, start up again networkless and then hibernate and return to the network the card is not functioning. To resolve the problem I release and insert the card while running and everything works again - not a big problem."
4,Good Solid Product...,"I bought this network card at the same time as I bought the Linksys 4 Port Cable/DSL Router/HUB figuring I wouldn't have any compatibility issues. I was right. It's easy to install in your standard laptop PCMCIA/Cardbus slot. Windows 95 autosenses it. You load the drivers from a floppy. Reboot, and you're up and running. It took all of about 10 minutes, including re-boot time.Performance is no problem, as it (and the router) autosenses the correct speed to send at. On a fast network (10Mbits; which is 10x faster than most broadband connections) it goes fast, on a faster network (100Mbits), it goes faster. For the money, you just can't go wrong."
1,Kids of all ages should avoid this game,"While I know this game is aimed at a very young audience, it is just terrible. The only kids who would want to play this aren't big enough to pick up the controller. This game has no focus and teaches nothing. Maybe if the graphics were sharper and more colorful and maybe if there was music it would be a decent game for kids, but it's not. Read your kid a book instead."
1,This is not a book!,"This isn't a book, it's a group of stickers. The drawings were realistic rather than the stylized type of drawings I'd have preferred for a children's book. Also, the names of the fish were all listed on the inside back cover rather than on or near each sticker."
3,"Pretty good, some flaws","I bought this watch because it was relatively inexpensive, had a large display, and a decent look.The functionality of the watch is pretty simple: Time, Run (e.g. the stopwatch), and Data (see total workout time and individual lap times). I wish in Run mode I could toggle the behavior: whenever you hit ""lap,"" the timer starts again from 00:00. In some cases this is really nice (you're doing laps and want to compare easily), but you have to switch to Data mode to see your total workout time.The other comment is that the watch is angled and hence can really only be worn on the left wrist.Rating this as 3* mainly because I'm about to send it in for its 2nd warranty service (yay for the 2 year warranty though). This is the 2nd time the Start/Lap and Stop buttons have stopped functioning, but only in Run mode, which is very odd."
1,"Good product, I'm sure, but won't work in the PC Card slot on a 06 Honda Civic","I bought this item hoping that it would work in the PC Card slot in my Civic, but when I popped it in and pressed the Card tab, it would not read from the device. I checked the card reader and media both in a laptop prior to using it in my car, so I knew that the media and adapter both work. I believe that Honda uses a Type I card slot instead of a Type II card (this adapter is Type II).So, if you are thinking of getting this for your car, you'd be better served getting theSanDisk SDAD-38-A10 CF to PC Card Adapter, which is specifically mentioned in comments as working w/Honda. Now I am just hoping that the new card that I bought will be able to address a 16GB CF card!"
5,Good addition to trailer,I purchased these brackets to allow me use my leveling hitch on my trailer that didn't have these brackets. This helps keep my truck leveled better and has made towing easier. Well worth the money if this is all you need to allow using a leveling hitch with your trailers. Installation was easy
3,Faded Roses,"""Bette of Roses"" is a competent album, it's just not a very memorable one. The country tune ""I Know This Town"" (Miss M Goes to Nashville!), the soothing ""To Comfort You"" and lilting lullabye ""Bottomless"" are wonderful showcases for Midler's talent, as well as allowing her to some vocal experimenation. But many of the songs, while pleasant enough, just don't grab the listener. As misguided as Midler's decision to record the Maria McKee-penned ""To Deserve You"" was (not a bad song if recorded by waif Maria, but totally wrong for the brassy Bette), at least it breaks the monotony. Compounding the problem is the slick production. Bette's best when some of her rawness is allowed to show through, and ""Bette of Roses"" covers it with a thick, glossy sheen. With the exception of that country track and ""I Believe in You""--the only moment when Bette's personality breaks through--this record could've been made by anyone. And Bette's not just ""anyone."""
5,Classic Bette!!!,"Bette of Roses is a stunning collection of Bette at her best. The songs range from heart wrenching ballads that can top even Wind Beneath My Wings and From A Distance, to fast paced rock tracks like The Last Time, in which Midler could easily pass for a twenty year old rocker from New York. Midler's vocal training of late gives her a vocal power and range that is awe inspiring. Fans will be shocked and delighted to hear her increased style. Bette followers and newcomers alike will get what they pay for with Bette of Roses. For ballads, rock, and even a little of the Midler wit and humor for which she is so well known, Bette of Roses is the Best Bette. Not to be missed!"
4,"Thought it might not be fun, but was totally wrong.","I'd read the reviews and decided this would be the board game I'd bring to the big family holiday party. I was looking forward to my brother and I having fun coming up with ridiculous answers. We're big fans of the ludicrous. When I got the game a week before the get-together I opened it up and began playing with my girlfriend. We weren't convinced it was going to be a hit. But we were were wrong.It turned out to be a lot of fun with eleven of us playing. There was a mix of serious players, and comedic saboteurs like my brother and I. Our 7 year old niece and nephew even played and had fun. 'There is a Moroccan saying, ""if the hill is on fire..."" it's a bad day to go for a hike wearing kerosene clothing.' I didn't fool anyone with this answer."
4,skinless and boneless sardines,This is the best price to buy the best protein from the sea. Sardines are vegetarians and least toxic of all the fish in the ocean.
2,sardines not that great,"Not that great, prefer sardines with skin and bones. These have a completely different taste"
2,Disappointing,"70 pictures. That's all the pictures I took before the memory card was full. What's worse is that I only used the flash with approximately ten of them. Unfortunately, I found this out while on vacation which stunk. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this card."
3,Not Weber Brand as Titled and Pictured,I've not put this on my grill yet. The quality looks reasonable. The item I received is not a branded Weber replacement part. I'd prefer that the item be accurately described as a non branded compatible part instead of described and pictured as a brand name item. Probably a reasonable value. Time will tell how it holds up.
4,Upgrade for Older (pre 2000) Weber Grills,"My grill came with the quick connect (Weber 3605) fitting, and well, after 14+ years of solid use, the tanks can't be filled anymore. The industry has moved to the QCC1 connection instead, so this is the item to buy to make your old grill compatible with the new tanks.Another way to go, and a bit less expensive, would be to purchase theWeber 7502 Hose and Regulator Kit (21-Inch), and then pick up an adapter at your local hardware store. The part you'll want is a 1/8 male to 3/8 flange adapter. They're brass colored and go for three bucks. Good luck and happy grilling!"
4,Easy to install,"I was nervous about installing kit, but it was easy. Took me maximum 10 minutes and works well."
3,Not original Weber part,"The image shows the part in Weber packaging. It did not come in that packaging. A note explained that they did not have the Weber and this was the substitute. It may be as good, haven't tried it yet"
1,Save your cash...,"Sorry, but this book REEKS. Although I'm sure the author spent considerable time writing this ponderous volume (most of it in a delusional state, probably), it is an enormous, overpriced collection of disjointed, preachy, and largely irrelevant thoughts. There was just no understanding it. It's the worst Aikido book I have ever seen, and the only reason I gave it 1 star was because Amazon wouldn't let me give it a ZERO."
1,Don't let your money climb for this software,"The first review of this game pretty well sums it up. To add to the frustration, I get to a point in the game after studiously following the flags that mark the trail and end up at a dead end. That's it! No mountain top, no end of the ice-fall, just a dead end. I called Mount Everest tech support who omnisciently told me to reduce my graphics speed (which I did but then couldn't even see the ladders to cross the Icefall) or upgrade my video and sound cards.Please don't waste your time on this game. The company who made it obviously didn't. There's a reason it's marked down astronomically."
2,not for solid core doors,"I purchased this for a 36 inch, solid core bedroom door that might weigh 100 lbs at most. At full tension, the unit just barely closed the door without the latch catching. Maybe it would be fine for a smaller, hollow core interior door."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this book looking for a concrete gameplan on increasing brain efficieny for studying, etc. Based on the title and back cover, it appeared to be a good fit. Instead, the book focuses on science and offers very little in the way of practical application. I didn't complete the book - reading 3 chapters and scanning the rest was enough wasted time."
3,"Useful, but slightly disappointing","As a technical writer of close to two decades, this was a little disappointing. I do believe you can freelance and make decent money technical writing, but in recent times, both writing and graphic arts have taken a backseat to programming. And programming is not even a sure thing anymore. Maybe the book is a little out-of-date? But it should be emphasized that tech writing is a great career for us English majors who love to write and who need to make a living - whether it's making $40K, 80K, or 120K. It's better than working at Starbucks (though that could be good too)."
4,they get the job done,"These extensions work reasonably well to hold instrument mics on a mic stand that primarily holds a vocal mic. They are well made, but the attachment can be a little loose unless you really crank the knob, and even then... I would not want to put a heavy mic on this extension. But it works nicely for an sm57 or a small diagphram condenser mic.It might be more convenient if the 5/8"" threads for the mic mount were positioned vertically with an adjustable threaded knob, rather than horizontally with fixed threads. But it works fine as is and the price is right."
5,charming thanksgiving book,This is a holiday favorite at our house. Lively colorful illustrations accompany the story of two differnt families and their different ways of celebrating Thanksgiving. My son laughs out loud at some of the pictures. It has a lovely message that holidays and families don't have to be perfect to enjoy as long as you are surround by people you love.
5,New View on a Standard History,"The general story of Alexander is well known. After taking over from his dead father at the age of sixteen he gained control of first the rest of Greece, they he defeated the Persian empire on his way to Northern India.The author is Lecturer in Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, England. He brings an insight to Alexander's battles that is lacking in similar reports from other writers. He is able to look at Alexanders contributions to combined arms operations, to the effective use of non-Greek forces, the use of a navy when required.During the twelve years Alexander campaigned he fought a wide variety of enemies from fortified cities, calvary, various kinds of infantry with varying combat styles. Alexander was successful against them all. What made him the most successful general of all time?"
4,Great album for people who liked 80's pop-rock,"If this album gets released in the 80's, it would easily have been top 20, with two or three of the tracks being top 40 material. Sounds a lot like Journey and The Storm, and the tunes are in the same vein as Toto, Asia, Foreigner, Loverboy, and other great 80's pop-rock bands. Contains a good mixture of lively rock songs and ballads. I would give it 4.5 stars if that were possible. They don't make enough of this type of music anymore."
1,Why does it Matter?,"You don't need Theomatics to prove GOD exists,just get on your knees and experience Him!That you can't do with Theomatics.Like the man before the great white throne judgement,Who says, ""I'm sorry GOD I cant go to HELL Your theomatic numbers are wrong"" The time frame in which we live was made very clear by Paul,in the book of Ephesians 1:1-14 The Father is calling out His sons whom He predestinated before the destruction of the world (foundation)in Christ Jesus to be like His only begotten Son Jesus,Who will be called home before the rapture of the church Phil 3:14. because they are not of this world,Jn 8:23.and theirs more much more but because of space I cant go into it here."
5,Awesome God hearing prayers!,These prayers are so anointed that praying them will bring answers to your life and the refreshing touch of the Holy Spirit to your life daily. This is my 2nd or 3rd copy and I can't keep them because my friends and family want the book once they see that all of it is based on the Word.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH SOME ACTIVISION TITLES,"Causes ""freeze-up"" while saving on Tony Hawk Underground. Activision claims they only support official Sony cards."
4,Stick With Sony,"The Nyko Memory Card works, it saves your files fine it deletes fine but after a month or 2 your data starts getting corrupted. My advice is to buy the Sony Brand it should be fine, I have never had a problem with Sony."
5,the J Geils band,a very good first album from this band...the songs are great ..the band is at their best..rockin' and rollin' at it's best
3,Steady Blues,"This is an interesting CD to see where this bouncy Boston Band got started. Its almost exclusively blues oriented rock but there are certainly several catchy if not spectacular songs. The bouncy cover of First I Look At The Purse shows that yes men can be materialistic about their women. The lyrics are delivered in a hillarious way by Peter Wolf. The Johnny Lee Hooker cover Serves You Right To Suffer is another gem where the guys play a cool slow blues groove with some great harmonica riffs by the Magic Dick.Hard Drivin Man and What's You Hurry are other stand out songs.This CD is not on the level as some of their later work whether it be Detroit Breakdown, I Do, Just Can't Wait, Freeze Frame, or others. However it is a nice start for these Boston Blues Hounds. Anyone curious about this band might be pleasantly surprised by picking up this release."
3,Be careful - this book does not include the plans!,"While this book would be useful to someone looking to build, but not yet sure what design they want, it does not include actual plans (you must purchse them seperately). It also does not include plans for cupolas as the write-up seems to indicate. These are only included as part of entire barns."
2,a so so book,"I decided to save my money and not buy this book. There are much better books out there for just a little more money. The editing, and proofreading are not up to snuff. It's a source book with information that anybody who is serious about building barns has already bypassed. For the homeowner who wants to build a shed in his back yard, maybe. For the serious barn builder, no."
1,"Obvious, short and boring","Each year I check out hundreds of library books to read to my children before bed. This is the first time I've been so disappointed by a book that I am writing a review. This book is meant for children but I can't see anything about it that would appeal to children. The illustrations are scary, the story is short and boring.The connection between actual history and this story will certainly be lost on the age range of children targeted by this book. And for the adults who might be reading it, it is a shallow and obvious parallel. With hundreds upon hundreds of wonderful books out there, skip this one!"
3,Old School Style is better,"It's funny that I click on a link to this item from the homepage and it's ""currently unavailable"" Whatever. Old-school style is better. Go to the drugstore, get a bottle of cinnamon oil (yes, they still make it) and throw some toothpicks into it. Leave it a few weeks (minimum) and voila! I have a bottle with toothpicks that have been there 10 years! Talk about saturated!I haven't tried this product, but I think the idea of going back to your Jr. High School days is better done the old style. And I don't see cinnamon paper anywhere... ;)"
5,Sweet!!!!,"Yeah. Toothpicks. For $7 no less. What a bargain!!! And they are flavored? No way. That's so cool. Why didn't anyone think of this - well besides Joe in Middle School - with flavoring for next to nothing. But still, a seven dollar tooth pick is my idea of fun. And even better - if you get sick of them you can sell them on ebay as pieces of the crucifix that Jesus was hanged on (or the guy that played him in The Passion)"
1,Very weak,"I feel like I got a box of plain wood. You can almost tell there is supposed to be some cinnamon in these, but not really. Maybe I got an old box but these were very disappointing."
4,Sinatra's Rat Pack,"Very good DVD to find out about The Rat Pack. I have been looking for something that brings me back to that era, and this is the closest."
1,"Pretentious, overwritten, overpriced","Wannabe Faulkner, wannabe Cormac, endless questing for the perfect metaphor--the writing is total drudgery. And the ""gutsy"" storyline is handled with the same old wink-wink nudge-nudge. Lowest rating."
5,A GREAT READ!!!!!,"This is only the second McBain book I have read. It is very , very good. I am going to try to find them to read in order. Have a long way to go I know. The Mugger is about Bert Kling, who is a partolman. He is searching for a mugger named Clifford. He is doing this in his off duty time. Then a young girl Kling has met is killed, was it by the mugger or not????? The ending is great is all I will say about that. The book is fairly short, easy to read and will hold you attention. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery."
3,Good fiction if your brain needs a break,"A bit violent, a bit simple, but it's easy to see why this guy was a cult classic. I am not usually a crime novel guy, but these are a nice break from non-fiction or more ""serious"" fiction. It is evident that this author never took himself too seriously, which is refreshing. Seems ironic I found him after he died, but he left behind a fairly massive body of work. No Vonnegut, but man cannot live on Vonnegut alone."
5,A total classic set!,Love this set of books! Still relevant even after reading them when I was a kid!! Excellent articles/stories and pictures. Will be reading them to MY kids now. :)
4,Ken Follett continues to write well.,"While not at the level of Pillars of the Earth, this historical novel did not disappoint. The Man from St.Petersburg would be especially interesting to readers with adult children as the characters are dealing with the generation gap. It was interesting to see a mother trying to protect an adult child from strong emotions where the mother has her own passion return."
4,Man from St. Pete,"I haven't read a Ken Follett novel in years. Evenly paced with a few turns, I envisioned what London was like in 1914. A bit more detail on St. Petersburg was missing, given the book's title. I expect to catch up on other Follett work that I missed."
3,Not one of his best,I have only recently started reading Ken Follett and all the books so far have been fascinating with the amount of historical detail and research. The Man from St Petersburg was readable but didnt catch my interest as much as his other novels. Worth a read in any case.Fortunately there are lots of other Ken Folletts to read. I have recommended his books to friends who have also become fans.
2,Morally sickening... avoid.,"This book IS quite interesting, a captivating plot and lots of historical detail sure to delight most readers. Its the cheap sex, lust and glorification of adultry that damns the whole thing. Not to mention, this book has the trashiest climax I`ve come across in a long time.Mr. Folletts obsession with adultary is extremely frustrating as he writes what are otherwise excellent historical thrillers. Trust me, if you have an ounce of traditional values in your body you'll want to hurl this book accross the room.Pick up A Dangerous Fortune or Pillars of the Earth first. Lets all hope Mr. Follett wakes up and takes his job a little more seriously soon."
4,"good story, worth the read","another follett win! what a great story. i highly recommend the book. if you haven't read follett before, this is a good place to start and one of his better books."
1,No Scoop Included,Please Help = There was no scoop included in my jar as it should be so I don't know how much to take!! Can anyone please tell me if normal scoop equals 1/8 or 1/4 teaspoon??!! Frustrating!P.S. Product also smells racid/spoiled I've used this before anf there was no smell so I think I got a defective jar and am in process of returning for exchange....
1,very bad!,"This book left me looking for other books the minute I picked it up, the author rambles and goes no where with the point, you are better off getting a Microsoft CD through Amazon, about Africa. This book is junk better used as toilet paper to put it mildly."
5,Rockin' Blues at it's finest,"In my opinion, the first two J Geils Band albums were their best. There is nothing pretentious about it - just good solid rocking blues with old-school instrumentation - bass, guitar, drums, B3 Organ, and harp. Peter Wolf is one of the best deliveries of this type of music. Short songs, good lean (and raw) production, and recorded well. Buy it.Also, I don't liking buying MP3s. That's the only way to get this. Please reissue this album on CD - or in one of the HD downloadable formats."
1,OMG. What the ...?,"This movie was way to preachy to be entertaining. Surely, this is not the kind of entertainment that a 5 year old should be subjected to. A big thumbs down to the production."
5,NGK's Always Work,"Love NGK spark plugs. Run them in mopeds, lawn mowers, generator, snow blower, and my brother's Yukon. NGK's seem to last the longest and help make the engine easier to start."
5,good night abandon where house where the raccoons aren't afraid to be themselves,can you just imagine a small infant getting to a gas station clerk to shove his foot in to this stuff and then realizing that Albertons has small parts for sell and getting in on that look at those anus's from the tv like me and ill give my cat leather pants.
5,Breyer Wood Corral,I bought this Breyer Wood Corral for my 7 year old daughter to go with her folding Melissa and Doug barn. After reading the reviews someone suggested getting this additional corral as the one that comes with the barn is not long enough to contain many horse models. It was a great suggestion. If your child has many horse models purchase this additional wood corral as it goes well with the Melissa and Doug corral.
4,Here it comes Herr Direktor Montlack,"Last night I had the privilege to see Andrew Montlack's first featured film at the venerable ""Gate Hell Social"" bar and lounge in Astoria, N.Y.BOHICA is an expensive B-movie comedy that rivals most of the trendy yet soon-to-be popular YouTube films of the moment. The story follows a would-be director who is confronted with a host of production realities in making a movie; all while dealing with profound fallible hypotheses in his actors and incurring incredible financial burden to his crew and himself. The movie's storyline seems to follow, coincidentally, the director's inner conflict with the outside world through the lens.Prepare to be assaulted with on-screen incompetence and eccentricities, in a revolving stream of quirky scenes since the bizarre Ed Wood.At the very least, Montlack's knack for the extreme and absurd, is an outstanding talent and has proved himself to be a young filmmaker to watch."
1,Item missing from packaging. Paid extra for overnight shipping.,Received box with packing material and an empty small plastic bag with the item label on it. Amazon has refunded my purchase. I would not attempt to purchase anything from this seller again.
5,Great fast business,The product was just as described and shipping was fast. Would do business again.
3,More Conneticut yankee in King Arthurs court.,"When you find a niche in sci-fi, fill it up. This story is a continuation of another average book in the spaceman in the era of knights genre."
1,NOT FOR THE 590,"I managed to get it on, but now I can not get the screws in. I used a C-clamp and then a vise and the holes don't match up. Now I need to find a way to get it off after it scratched up my barrel. This is a horrible fit for the 590 and now I have a barrel that looks terrible. Thanks Mossberg for making me think about a Remington. This is false advertisement need to file a claim."
1,Ruined My Barrel,"This was listed as being compatible w/ the 590, but the brackets and screws are not long enough. The brackets trashed the Parkerization on the barrel of my brand new Mossberg 590."
1,Don't buy for a Mossy 500 Cruiser,"Bought one for my Mossy 500 ""Cruiser"" model w/ the 18.5 inch barrel. Forget about it - won't fit as its too long. This is made for a standard barrel. Looking like I just ate it."
4,fast shipping and no problems,"great product, the matte finish on the heat shield offers a nice contrast with the black gloss finish from the mossy 500 12g 20"" . a bit of struggle the couple the the nut with the bolt. i also prefer using a barrel clamp instead of the plastic spacer."
5,maybe my favourite 'ash' album,"the review title says it all, 'there's the rub' is really one of wishbone ash peak of creation. you can find in it, all the guys, with the new axe-man, Laurie Wisefield, can do better; great vocals, great melodies and the trademark twin-lead guitar solos, a piece like F.U.B.B. shows you it all! with no doubt, but it's my opinion, their best instrumental song! highly recommended, trust me! (I'm italian, sorry for my english!)"
4,The classic Wishbone Ash 70's album.,"If you like Wishbone Ash, you probably already know about this 1975 album, and like it. What's to say ?"
5,There's the rub,"Wishbone ash's ""There's The Rub"" Has to be one of their best records.The duel guitars are great! I would recomend this to any Wishbone Ash fans. But you would already know how good this is.If your new to Wishbone Ash, This would be a great start."
2,Should have been another Jedi Apprentice book,"This was not a ""new book"" at all - it should have been under the Jedi Apprentice series... In my humble opinion - wait til it comes out in paperback."
2,The Sicilian Taimanov,"I must say that I was quite disappointed after buying the book. The book was written by GM Plaskett of England. He covers most of the important variations of the Taimanov with some games from top level grandmaster play in the 90s. There are 10 chapters followed by a summary of variations. There is a decent amount of verbal commentary in each of the games however one of my pet peeves was the dearth of analysis of any of the games. I think this is a good book if you are at least expert strength and are a regular Taimanov player. However, i think this book must be supplemented by another opening text. I am not sure if there is that much more material here that is useful than can already be found in MCO or NCO."
2,could have been worse,"im not sure what he was thinking with this book, cause it looks like plaskett probalby spent some time writing/compiling this, but ultimately he produced nothing special at all.you can probably read this book and not be any better at playing the taimanov than before..."
1,Low Cost Pool is Junk,"This pool deflated within 30 minutes of blowing it up (a lot of work...) and ALSO leaked water out the bottom. (Shame on us for filling it right after working hard to get it inflated...). Shame on Amazon for showing 2001-2002 reviews first. The quality of this product has obviously changed in the last 8 years. The return policy makes it impossible to return now that we had a :( Christmas surprise -- we bought it in October and now that we had a problem last week, we are too late to return... shame on us.Oh yes, the sun shade -- that did not work within the first 1 min -- it is poorly designed and attached and blows right off. The fact the pool did not work either, that is unforgivable. Twenty bucks wasted."
2,Great fun BUT not long lasting,This pool was great I have two toddlers and I wanted something big enough that I could join them and teach them how to swim. I loved the pool until it ripped because my 27lb son jumped in the pool. I told you his weight to demonstrate that he is super small and he was able to rip the plastic. I was very sad when I had to toss it after only 2 weeks of using it:-(
4,"Pool is great, shade is not!","Like any other pool it is great, but the shade part falls off. The shade is the reason I got this pool. I can get the shade part on but it falls over very very easy, so what good is it."
1,Don't buy this pool!,The pool arrived incomplete without the plug! We made do but the top sunshade is a disaster that never holds up. I rarely write reviews but I had to warn other parents: do not buy this. Your kids will be disappointed.
4,"great value, great shade","This is a great value... I love that it has the shade which is detachable, and it's much larger than I thought it would be. Highly recommend! Only down side and this isn't about the product is that it will take forever to inflate if you don't have an electronic pump. We're using this in winter as a ball pit and in spring/summer as a pool for our 1 year old."
4,works well for me,"These headphones have decent sound. The sound isn't loud as the in ear ones, but the quality is good. The wrap around style suits me better. They don't fall out like the ones that go in the ear do. Often with my small ears the others fall off. I walk to work in them and they stay on fine. But if you are looking to cancel out background noise these won't really do that."
4,Excellent Sound,"I bought these headphones basically for using them with my computer for music and games and I was looking for a neckband style, cheap, but great sounding headphones.I have been using the HS820 for about a month and I loved the crisp sound it produces, along with a powerful bass. I'm very picky with headphones, and these definetely pass the test, soundwise. I listen a lot of trance music, and they can reproduce high-quality MP3s with amazing results. Also the groovy tunes from GTA SA sound great.The only thing I complain about is that there are times that they feel uncomfortable, so you need to move them to the point that you don't feel them, cause if you don't, it may result in achy ears."
5,Compact Flash PC Card Adapter,"Purchased for use with Janome Memory Craft 9700. Downloading embroidery designs to compact flash memory card. Insert memory card in adapter, load in machine - works great!"
4,Works as advertised,"SanDisk knows CompactFlash (CF). They invented the format. As expected, SanDisk's CompactFlash PC Card Adapter works with all the CF cards out there. And it works under various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows XP and Apple ""Jaguar"" Mac OS X.Made off of stainless steel, it is ruggedly made, too.Just one complaint: like all the adapters I looked at, SanDisk lacks an eject button. It would be nice if I can eject the CF card without ejecting the SanDisk adapter as well. But for the money, I can't really complain.Pros:- Flawless compatibility with all CF cards and various operating systems- Ruggedly builtCons:- No eject button- Supports only CF (does not support other formats such as Ultra CF, SD/MMC, MemoryStick)"
1,Designed to frustrate!,"I was looking for a wireless mouse to hook up to my PC/TV and didn't know what an Air Mouse was before I went looking for this product. All the features and programing looked fine on the specs but when I got this ""mouse"" the reality was much different.The first mouse that I received worked for a week and then just stopped. I figured that it was a defective unit and returned it for a second. This one seemed to connect and work fine at first.On my Desktop it works fine, but take it across a webpage and the frustration begins. Take it across any frame on a page and the mouse starts interprets it as a third button click and grabs the page. Every time I get the page to the correct place I want to view, if I move the trackball the whole page starts to scroll. No new drivers are available to stop this behavior and when I went to the support site I got a ""404 Page Not Found"" error.This mouse is no end to frustrating and I'm returning this one also."
4,optical presenter mouse,"This was also a gift and the party that recieved it,gives talk and prsentions and says it works just great."
5,A blue guitar lecture,"First of all I have to admit that I've always been a Robben Ford fan. Having said that, in my opinion, it is indisputable that this is a fantastic CD.If you are a blues fan and you like ""blue guitar"" played the way it should be: intense, passionate and with great feeling; if you think that slow blues are the real deal, do not hesitate and buy this CD! It is going to be your bliss for the foreseeable future."
5,Excellent RPG Game,"Despite its old age, this game remains one of the best RPG games ever. Most of the orc and human units are very similar, which is disappointing to me...but as the civilizations advance they develop unique abilities. Their magical abilities are especially different. The humans have the advantages of healing, exorcism, polymorph, and invisibility spells...but the orcs have necromancy (!) and better magic for destruction. It's pretty cool."
5,Travis Hits!,"Although Coldplay take center stage when it comes to gentle rock, Travis have always offered an earthier, folkier approach to warm rock lullabies. They can be bittersweet, on ""Flowers in the Window,"" optimistic, such as on ""Sing,"" or sorrowful, on ""Why Does It Always Rain on Me."" The earlier material is a little weak, but the latter makes up for it. Here you'll find tracks about love like ""Side"" and current politics like ""The Beautiful Occupation."" Travis are an underrated band with strong melodies and, by listening to this collection, a great catalogue."
5,The Nicest Band in the World,"Travis, they are really the nicest people in the world, and I hate celebs. This album contains all their singles from their four brilliant albums, from 'Good feeling' to '12 Memories'. It also includes the single only 'Coming Around' which is good, the new uplifting single 'Walking in the Sun' and the 'Distance; which I think is great. Apparently this is the first of the planned four best of albums from Travis, so we will be seeing this Scottish band for a long time to come, which of course is not a bad thing. This is a great introduction to this band which never broke the US. Can't recomend it enough."
4,used book but in good condition,"bought this used book, even though the pages were yellow, at least it was still readable and in good condition. satisfied."
3,Interesting but self-serving,An interesting story. However the fact that an officer who served in a number of fronts (including the Eastern front)had no inkling of the atrocities committed by the Germans is very hard to believe.
3,"Good, but not great WW2 account from the German side","This book was fairly well-written, and contains some interesting history. However, written from the perspective of an artillery officer, I felt that it had neither the intensity and grittiness of Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier"", or the strategic and tactical insights of von Mellenthin's ""Panzer Battles"" - both of which I would recommend as superior war books written from the German perspective."
4,UNIQUE,"This is the story of a german officer during world war 2.He served on almost all the major front's during the war and managed to survive. I thought the best part's of this book were, the battle for Berlin and his time spent in Soviet prison camp's after the war.Siegfried Knappe {the author} was a decent german who was thrown into a hellish experience."
1,Beyond broken,"I was excited to receive this frame, but when I slid it out of the box, the frame had broken into 3 or 4 pieces, separated from the glass and started falling onto the floor. Instinctively, I tried to catch the falling pieces and sliced my hand on the glass piece. I contacted the company about their faulty, beyond repair product and never received a response. Wasted money, with a scar to boot."
2,Meh,"I haven't finished putting the frame together (all 19steps of it...) but so far, i haven't had that much fun with this product. I did get good impressions of baby's feet, but I had to figure out several tricks to working with the clay really fast. I kneaded the clay, put it on foil and tried to roll it out. It sticks to the wooden roller. It has the consistency of marshmallow fluff. Trick: Wrap the roller in tin foil. Then, when you're ready for the impression part, get baby's foot wet to get a smooth impression. I'm currently waiting the 24-48 hrs required for the clay to dry before I do anything else. Here's hoping it turns out!"
1,Waste!,"Bought it. Got it. Installed it. Used it for a day for like 10 shots. Worked. Removed it from my Olympus D380 to my card reader for transfer to computer. Did transfer. Installed it again in camera & then ""CARD ERROR!"" Now it's junk!"
1,An absolute NIGHTMARE if you get it on your hands!,"DOW needs to provide a LARGE, VISIBLE warning label (why not use the bright yellow cap?) about how impossible it is to get this stuff off your hands/skin! There are many first time users who may assume that you can use your fingertips to spread this stuff neatly and evenly, like you would caulk. There are also many users who might not happen to have their reading glasses on hand (many don't), so they miss the small print warning. I've had this stuff on my fingers now for a week, and my hands look diseased! Once cured, this stuff will literally bond to your skin worse than even KrazyGlue! As for the product itself, the applicator often leaked, despite my screwing it on correctly. Clearly, the many other negative reviews regarding the lousy applicator corroborate my findings."
1,Horrible Stuff: 1-time use. Impossible cleanup.,"One-time use only. Impossible to clean. Ruined more things than 'fixed'.After first use, the straw and nozzle clog with hardened ""stuff"" and they are impossible to clean with any household solvent.I've never used this product and NOT gotten it on my hands and/or the surroundings. the delivery mechanism and the material itself is impossible to work with. This stuff seems to explode and drip everywhere. Once it's on your hand (and heaven forbid your carpet, wall, clothes), say goodbye. This stuff cures with water and nothing seems to dissolve it (I've tried paint thinner, acetone, goof-off, oils and lotions).Just threw away my 4th can after trying to use it a second time. Never will I consider a Dow product like this again."
4,Not Simon's best but has good heart-warming moments,"This story about a boy's puberty is not quite entertaining when it deals with the boy's dealing with his sexuality but it is excellent when it addresses the tensions between the sisters and the solidarity of the members of the family with the refugees from Germany. If you can ignore the puberty shenanigans, this is a touching story about a family that faces the challenges of the late Depression with love and courage."
5,Grandson Loved It!,"I've bought a number of games for my 7-year-old grandson, but Rat-A-Tat really caught his attention. He kept asking to play it. The rules are simple enough that he understood them easily, in fact he was soon coming up with his own versions of the rules (play for high score rather than low, etc.) Even his 4-year-old brother enjoyed playing. It was good discipline to have to remember the cards and to not look again at them."
4,Great family game,"I gave this game to my grandson for his seventh birthday and the entire family enjoyed playing it over and over again. It didn't take long to learn the rules and they loved yelling ""Rat-A-Tat-Cat"" when they felt they had a winning hand."
5,School age fun,"Rat-A-Tat-Cat is a simple, easy to learn, card game that is fun for all ages.The illustrations of cats and rats add a humorous new dimension for school age children."
4,Great game,"I bought this last year but my daughter is just really enjoying it now. It took a couple of minutes to figure out but then it is easy. So far we've only played with the two (of us) but I imagine it will be even more fun with more people. As with most 1-off card games, you COULD use a regular deck of cards - you are paying for the ""rules of the game"" (and of course the cute rats and cats)."
5,Fun Game,My kids (ages 6-11) cant get enough of this game they want to play it over and over again!! Highly recommend to families with wide age range!
5,Great learning tool!,"I picked this up at a yard sale for $.25! Best quarter I've spent in a long time, and it is totally worth more. I bought this for my therapy practice. I see a lot of kids aged 10 and under, so I am always looking for educational games that don't make lots of noise or use batteries.This is a good game for high-functioning kids and/or those who love to learn games, especially card games. While there is strategy to this game it is easy enough for kids to pick up and the more they play the more they'll learn. In fact, just today, I got beat three rounds in a row by a young client!"
4,From Side Show to Broadway,"The mysterious Fredrick Thompson left little biographical information in his wake, but Woody Register has taken the scant evidence and woven it into a revealing narritive of the man who made Coney Island famous. This book cchronicles an even more important story as well, the concepts of leisure and amusements in the 20th century. The theme park, theatrical spectacular, Vegas showroom and Broadway all own a debt to Fred Thompson's inner child. This book is a must for anyone serious about the business of fun."
5,Was Thrilled to Get the Last Copy in Stock!,"Easily said: Rob Grad and Superfine were at the top of their game with this CD back in early 2000's! Although I know they are no longer together today, at least I have a piece of their history. Rob's abilities, talent and range are genius. This man hits high notes that reach out beyond the universe. I only wish I had known about them (2003-ish) before now. But at least I do know now and love the CD. I Zumba to it everyday! Kicking some butt daily! Rob stands out due to nothing more than his pure raw talent. His voice, one of a kind. Like no other I've ever heard. I hope Amazon.com gets more of these CD's, so you too can hear for yourself! Rob Grad now, today in 2011, has a solo career and new projects under way. So stay on the lookout for him and his next new projects! I'm certainly enjoying this Superfine CD and anything else where Rob Grad is the main vocalist! Thanks Robbie! Tonya"
5,Great product,I have tried several ear buds for under $100 including Esure 1 and Ultimate Ear. The JBL ear buds are very comfortable and with a little fiddling with the fit they have a far superior sound than the other ear buds I have tried. The cord does make noise when I run but if I just place the cord away from my body this is not a problem. For the Amazon price of less than $50 this is a great product 5 stars.
5,A Wonderful resource,This book really is a wonderful resource for physicians interested in a statistical basis for their practice. I had been seeking for a book with hard numbers on the frequency with which symptoms and signs are found. This book really does an outstanding job
5,How to make a daughter happy,"I bought this knife as a Christmas present for my daughter. We had attended a knife course at a local chain in Chicago and had the chance to use several high quality kitchen knives. This particular knife (and the whole set) is outstanding for women who don't have large wrists and forearms for cutting all day. It's lightweight, well balanced and has no hiding place for food residue. The blade is razor thin and razor sharp. It should be cleaned immediately after use and returned to safe storage. It would be easy to get a severe cut just from a glancing touch of the blade. It is also easy to thin-slice 10 pounds of potatoes and 2 pounds of sweet potatoes in record time and without breaking a sweat. I'm a long-time Santoku fan but I'm happy to play with the Chromas anytime. If I wasn't old already, these would be my lifetime knives, even though I think they're ugly. Ah, well..."
5,I love this knife.,"This is my new favorite knife. I bought it to replace an 8"" Global chef knife, my previous favorite knife. I would have stuck with my Global, but I've gotten too used to using 10"" knives at work, and the Global just feels too small now. I have a culinary degree, and I work both the line and prep at a high-volume restaurant. This knife has a fantastic grip, it's actually designed for the pinch grip that should be used to properly hold a chef's knife. The balance is fantastic, and it is a very good looking knife. It's actually almost too sharp, the first few times I used it on tomatoes, it slid across the skin a bit before gliding through like a hot knife through butter. After a couple of uses, it's handled everything I've ran it through perfectly. The box it comes packaged in is quite nice as well, serving quite well until I get around to getting a blade guard for a 10"" blade. If I win the lottery, I'll be buying a full set of these."
2,Not the quality I was hoping for.,These chimes are not as sturdy as I hoped for. The chimes are not very loud at all. I was dissappointed. They won't recreate the childhood memory of sitting around the chimes on Christmas Eve.
1,Cheap,I had one of these when I was a kid and loved it. This one was cheap and fell apart almost instantly sending candles that were lit flying almost setting fire to my couch!!
2,rehashed story!,"This book is the latest in a string of books by this company that is very disappointing. They capitalize on the great work the Fishmongers in Seattle do, and don't represent their real philoshophy well. People would do better to get the Fishmonger's real book!"
4,The Shades,I remember this book so well. I remember thinking it would be so cool to have a shadow friend or even be a shadow. I really hope I can find this book to share with my 9 year old daughter.
2,Recommend other card,"I bought this card for my IPAQ 3955. Besides having slow read and write speeds, the realiability of the card is bad. Half of the time I am only able to use 3/4 of the available memory and than get writing errors. Save yourself the time and agony and buy a better brand like Viking."
4,works just fine,my compact flash card works just fine & got here in a timely mannor as well thank you
5,works in Muvo shell,"My husband bought this, and it works great in a Creative Nomad Muvo2 shell (4gb MD removed) that we bought for $40 on eBay. For $100, it's a great deal for a 512 mb MP3 player!"
2,This card will not work in your Imagemate SDDR_75 reader,"I bought a new sandisk 512mb CF and installed it in my Sandisk imagemate-SDDR-75 card reader and my card reader wipe put all my pictures and my card would not work after the imagemate SDDR-75 card reader installation. I ended puting it back in the camera and used the camera software to reformat it. I call Sandisk and they told me that;Thanks for contacting SanDisk Technical Support.There is a compatibility issue with the SDDR-75 and the newer CF cards. We would normally offer an exchange for a reader that is compatible; however, your reader is no longer under warranty. We certainly apologize for any inconvenience. OUCH!The following readers are compatible:SDDR-86- 6 in 1 reader SDDR-88- 8 in 1 reader SDDR-91- USB 2.0 CompactFlash reader"
2,It's the only book on Dinah.,"I read this book recently, and I must say I was really disappointed. I thought it was quite poorly written, and terribly edited. There are typos throughout the book, misspellings, etc. Some of the interview material was just plain confusing. However, having said that, it is the only book I personally have been able to find on Dinah Washington, so it must get some credit for that. There is quite a bit of information in the book, but I felt it could have been much better organized, and I felt like the author's personal critiques were a bit misinformed. Overall, not that great of a read, as far as enjoyment, but it does provide some information on a terrific lady, which is sorely lacking in the jazz annals."
5,My 2 year old loves it,"My daughter absolutley loves the antics of Clifford and his friends. The message the video sends about real friends and acceptance of others are wonderful, yet they are stated in terms that even a two year old can grasp. I enjoy watching Clifford with her, because it is not a syrupy and sappy as some of the other children's shows out there. I am sure that other children will love the big red dog as much as mine does!"
3,New Edition Needed,"This book is huge, almost telephone-book size. It contains valuable demographic information. Its disadvantage is that it is now out-of-date. The two very newest and finest casino-hotels are only listed as pictures of ""things to come"". This guide is out-of-date in other areas also. The public transportation prices are incorrect (too low), and trips to outlying tourist attractions like Hoover Dam or Bryce Canyon, or the Grand Canyon have been changed considerably from those listed. We left our copy in the hotel room, rather than carry it home."
2,These don't stack,"I don't own these tumblers, but I read on another site that they don't stack because the bottom is round and the top is oval-shaped. Major disadvantage!"
1,Terrible,I've been playing these backyard games for a while. At first it's fun but after a while it just gets too easy. You can't lose even if you play on hard. ...
4,Buy... Must Buy!,"This game is awesome with great graphics and the players are really good. I gave this game a 4 because your opponents don't do anything but stand there, while you have the ball. They just cover you. I thought it would be a challenge but it isn't.But... The players are really good and, I recommend that you buy this awesome game. GO BASKETBALL!!!"
2,Good Flick For Collectors of B-Movies,"Based off of the CD ROM that you can get under the same name, this movie is a compilation of various other b movies. Basically from the 'Bimbo' movie series from Surrender Cinema.I loved some of the movies that have scenes in it, Cannibal Women In The Avacado Jungle Of Death, and Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity to name a couple. But this tape is really some silly attempt to throw in a bunch of the funniest scenes from these movies to try and get some new storyline. It fails miserably. But it is funny in some parts. I haven't got the CD ROM yet, but it is on order. It will be interesting to see how different it is. A good piece to collect if not just for interests sake."
5,One of my all time favorites!,"Wow.. this one I never get tired of. A true talent and a wonderful voice. She has some similarities to Toni Braxton but her vocal skills put her in a class by herself. She is far superior to Brittney Spears and, in my book, much classier. I cannot believe that her talents have not been capitalized on yet! HOw does a talent like hers go unnoticed? I just hope she doesnt get stooped to the level that Spears has gone who is now nothing but a tramp in my book. Jordan Hill doesnt need to rely on sex and skin to sell her obviously wonderful vocal talents.I continue to check for a new album from Jordan Hill.. but nothing yet! I hope the rumors are true that she'll be releasing a new song and (hopefully) an album to follow this year."
5,A Whole World Of Potential,"Not many people have heard about this rising star which is sad because she is incredible. Jordan Hill's first album, which was produced by David Foster is full of emotional ballads and catchy tunes, which will one day establish her as one of music's best. On Remember Me This Way, Jordan delievers a powerful yet moving performance which will bring tears to your eyes. Written by Foster, and his wife Linda Thompson, the song is so amzing, I cannot understand why Top 40 didn't give this song a fair chance. Other efforts include a great dance tune called Ride which is getting airplay at clubs all over the world, and For The Love Of You which features Foster on backround vocals (he sounds pretty good). Jordan carrer will only blossom as time goes on, and hopefully AC and Top 40 radio will get out of the shell and recognize incredible talent when they hear it!!!!! Great job Jordan."
4,Decent debut by this new Finnish band...,"Good band, good album. For fans of Opeth, Dark Tranquillity, Katatonia, etc. Very melodic, progressive sound."
5,excellent reading,wilbur smith's books are excellent reading. i've recently discovered this author and can't get enough of his writing. i would reccomend this book highly and any other wilbur smith books as i have read several.
4,great book,"got book quickly in great condition will definately buy from this seller again, made perfect present for my boyfriend who is an avid reader."
3,Compelling but deeply flawed,"As far as the overall plot and the action, White Star is reasonably entertaining. But there are several problems which keep it from being a really good book. The characters and their interactions are at best cheesy, and some of them, especially the 'love interest', add nothing to the story. The action of the final battle between the two snipers is well written and exciting, but does all of the action have to be saved for the end of the novel? White Star is worth reading, but if you want truly great sniper stories stick to Stephen Hunter."
3,Nice looks. High maintenance.,"I had recently renovated my kitchen and wanted to add a little something to make it look more futuristic. The light looks great, but the glass dome of the light creates a lot of surface area where dust will collect. I find myself having to take the glass dome off fairly often to remove the dust. Don't get me wrong. I like the look, but if I had it to do over again I would consider the maintenance efforts such as they are."
1,If you want to go insane - buy this,"Assembly of poles - no problem; getting fabric tent over them - ridiculous. In fact, I am going to write Schyuling a letter - maybe they'd like to assemble it (for several hours while two toddlers await ... fun). Don't buy it - it's terrible."
2,very poor,"So much pages with trikcs (almost always tracing of another books o magazines) I was waiting more about pencils, markers, I don't know, techniques for improving really skills to be best my architectural drawins..."
3,Limited durability for guitar strings,"Realistically, if one is stringing instruments frequently especlially with steel or complex wound strings, this is more use and harder use than clipping light soft wires used in most electronics. However, only a few days after arrival, the blades are all nicked up.I like the clippers, just will keep more of them around at this price."
5,Absoleutly the best Vangelis album. You will play it often!,"One just cannot put this music down. It will haunt your mind all day. I first heard it as a theme in the movie ""Runaway Train."" I didn't know where the music came from but I liked it. I accidentally came upon it when I bought the album. I highly recommend it. Wonderful!!!"
3,Seams are a problem,"Like other reviewers said, the seams make a VERY pointed nipple area. I decreased the pointiness with my sewing skills (sewed it to round it out more) but my problem is with the top seam between the satin and the lace. The joining of fabrics is very thick and it shows under thin clothing. Haven't been able to fix that problem."
2,Glamorise strapless bra - pointing breasts,"This bra would be perfect if the cups were seamless. There is a center ""dart"" (seam) stitched from under each breast to the nipple area. The dart comes to a very sharp point, much like a dart stitched in a skirt. The pointiness reminds me of the old fashioned bras that women wore years ago....the pointier the better. Unfortunately, I personally don't fill in the ""points"" and therefore when I wear this bra under knit fabric or something form-fitting, the points fold and are very obvious under the garment. It would have been a better design if it were ""seamless"" like most bras are. Otherwise it is a very comfortable bra and it is also pretty to wear under something low cut or v-necked."
1,Terrible bra for size c!,"Should have known that this would not work for me. It smashes your breast like a mammogram! It might work ok for smaller cups; but, did not do well at all for my c cup. I will not even wear this around the house....... Fits to poorly."
4,Great fit,I never wear a strapless bra but needed one for a top I bought. This bra fits very comfortably and gives me the support I need. I might wear it a lot more than I thought I would!
3,Very pretty but...,"I liked the lace and design, but it's not as supportive as I would like it to be. Also the seams were not as smooth as I would have liked."
3,"Good, but I wish it had some cup support","This is a nice bra and it is comfortable. I did have to pull it up once in a while, but it did the job. It would have been better had it had slightly padded cups to prevent the squished and saggy look. It would help support and uplift a little."
5,Great gift liters up easily soft and cuddly toy,Choose for granddaughter for birthday gift liters up changes colors and makes going to bed at nite fun and easy
3,Doesn't look the same as picture.,"I ordered the shifter knob and the first attempt for delivery UPS either delivered to the wrong address or left it in front of my apartment building and someone took it but Amazon made it right by sending another one immediately and using FedEx which does not leave packages on door steps not caring if the package actually makes it to its buyer. The picture on the website does not represent the actual product because in the picture the black knob has a white Hurst emblem on it and the actual knob does not. Other than that, all is well."
2,Disappointing and derivitive,"This book was a disappointment. For the first 150 pages NOTHING of any real interest happens. I very nearly put the book down. After that first 150, we finally get some action, but this action is indeed centered around other characters than our heroine. It seemed like I was suddenly reading another, albeit better, book. Unfortunately, this much more action packed second half is essentially a rip off of all those many movies about men hunting men, while the first half was so much like the Honor Harrington books that I decided to simply go and reread those superior tomes. I suppose my sincere recommendation is that you do the same."
1,Enid Blyton writes Starship Troopers!,"The best thing about this novel is that after reading it I have decided to write a novel myself. My inspiration being that if I was iliterate and had English as a secondary language I could not come up with a bigger pile of rubbish. According to some of the other reviews this book is the weakest of the series. I will never know as this book has put me off *reading anything ever again!* It really is that poor. How people can justify giving it 4 or 5 stars in a review is beyond my comprehension. Books like 'A Game of Thrones' by George RR Martin, or 'Perdido Street Station' by China Miéville, deserve that kind of rating. Read them... Go. Now."
1,YUCK!,"All I can say is;1. Same boring challenges.2. AI seems to just ""flip coins"" to decide who to vote off!3. The AI seems to change it's mind about the political situation at camp every minute (again the AI is ""fliping coins"" to decide who it likes and does not like).4. Too many technical problems (installing and playing).5. Costs way too much for what the game offers.Just keep watching and enjoying the show! Don't buy this game!"
1,Do not buy this game!,This game is horrible. There is nothing more to this game but clicking the mouse button. There really is no challenge to playing this game. This is supposed to be an interactive game? Yeah Right!
2,Can't get the challenges to work,"I have purchased two of these games. I have installed them on three different computers and each time the game stops working at the challenge screen You are supposed to get information on what controls to use during the challenge, but all that happens is the players stand around waiting to start. The game seems really cool if it would work correctly."
2,Survivor fan?? Skip this game..,"Like many- I am a huge survivor fan and was very excited to get this game, but i was disappointed in the actual game play- there is too much repetition- in the mini games, dialogue etc. It is nice to revisit old fan favorites and play along using characters you already know..but be warned, this software has a bug that makes installtion hard and keeps kicking me out and onto the desk top..Take my advice, and vote this game out of the tribe!! Immediately"
1,Too many problems,"I bought this for my kids, and they were happy, but when I go to install it, it won't work, you have to go online just to see if you can fix it, and there they have about 17 patch's that you have to download to make it work, then realize later that it wont work with my ATI video card!!! It also won't wook for vodoo cards. Don't bother with this game!!! It's not worth the problems."
3,OK Game,"This game is fun, but somtimes it is very hard. The only fun part is the challenges. I have made it to final tribal council a couple times. But it is really hard not to get voted off. Even if you have an alliance with someone, they may still vote for you. Overall, This is a fun, but hard game."
2,It's not a wonderful game!,It gets old fast when you either shoot with a bow and arrow or Pull a rock for every challenge. Everyone breaks there alliances with you and if you don't win immunity you are voted off. People also say they are going to vote for Kimmi one second and the next minute when we go to tribal council They vote for Elizabeth or something. This game was not very well made.
1,Boring!,Okay... You truely are a Survivor if you survive this game. it is so boring that you deserve a million dollars for sitting through it. Might aswell buy a new mouse if you buy this game. There is sooo much clicking. I am a HUGE Survivor Fan. I suggest buying the new Survivor game coming out. This game isn't worth it.
3,A 1909 murder mystery,"Lawrence Blakeley is a stiff collar (literally), middle-of-the-road average life lawyer. So naturally he has to be thrown into the middle of an adventure. While riding on a train a man is murdered. To Blakeley's horror he believes he was the intended victim. Then circumstantial evidence starts pointing at him as the murderer! Add to that a mysterious young woman that he starts falling for. Blakeley doesn't know just how she's involved with the murder. What he does know is that she's involved with his best friend and business partner, which puts another kink in the works. Rounding out the usual suspects is an amateur detective who gets as many misses as he does hits as everyone tries to figure out who was The Man In Lower Ten."
1,"just the facts, ma'am","I downloaded this book because it was free. There was NO information on it, not even a cover picture. So, I thought I'd try it.I got about 10 pages in before I lost interest. It appears to be a detective story written in the style of the Maltese Falcon. The dialogue is choppy, the mood dark. I'm much more of a light and fluffy book person.just so you know to make a better download decision."
4,For Agatha Christie fans,Mary Roberts Rinehart has the ability to take you into the past and let you see the world that was when the action is taking place. A good mystery that presents all the clues and then lets you go along on the trip as they are all fit together. I enjoyed it.
2,Interesting Topic - Repetitive Thesis,"After hearing the author talk on public radio, I was looking forward to new information and insights on how women are portrayed in tv, motion pictures, and literature. What Issacs states would be hard to argue, women ARE put into categories - strong vs. weak - or as she puts it, strong dames or wimpettes. However, I would argue that men are put in these categories, as well. It is a very quick read & does provide recommendations at the end concerning books, movies, and television programs that show strong women, not 'wimpettes'. I would suggest any parent or concerned other who feels women and girls are portrayed offensively read Issacs essay for a primer but actually write to the 'powers that be' that are in charge of network decisions,the movie makers, and, finally, the writers that put the 'pictures' in our minds of what a strong women really means."
2,"Interesting subject, but a disappointing read.","I have to admitt that it was the title of the book that caught my attention. I was excited to finally find a critique of modern women and the wimpy, unaccountable, excuse-making attitudes many television personalities inflict upon the viewers. My first disappointment was that the book focuses mainly on fictional TV characters, not real people. What is the point of criticising a fictional personality if it is the actress' job to portray her that way? The author missed out on the major wimpette of our time - Oprah Winfrey. While I don't mean to pick on Oprah, I want to point out that there are plently of true cases the author could have used in her book."
2,If you like hard rock...,This is rough and ready music with a hard-nose seamy side like hard rock music melodramatic and somewhat crude in tone.
5,SAVATAGE,"This is a great album. If your a fan of concept albums or good metal, then you should own Dead Winter Dead. Everything about this album owns. Great concept, great songs, solos, and vocals. Savatage are a great band. This is a good album to start with if your new to this band. This is for sure one of my fave albums that I own."
3,Phone cop,"This sort-of does what it says, in that it will play the recorded ""Stop-calling- me-you-jerk!"" message. The catch is, you have to monitor calls and manually push the button to activate the message when your caller ID tells you that the incoming call is from a number that you know - or suspect - to be a telemarketer, slimeball bill collector or other undesirable. For around $10 including shipping, it's worth it sometimes just to not have to actually answer the phone or let the unwanted calls ring through to clutter up your voicemail."
2,not worth buying,"I brought these knives in August and I noticed they were rusting, so i returned them and was sent new ones. It have not been a month since I had the new ones and they are rusting already.Since my husband throw out the box I can not return these. You should be very careful with these knives my husband had to go to the ER because one of the knives cut him while he was doing dishes.Do yourself a favor and do not get these knives."
4,misleading title,"The daughter of an explorer, a shady illegal game smugler, and a bureaucrat come together on an alien artifact. Each wants something, but the place abounds with mysterious unintentional traps.*Spoiler* I found the ending the best though as it offers a look at upgraded senses and a high civilization."
4,Cool game,I have always love the backyard series. Especially football these games are for all ages. At least thats what I think. The backyard series gave me insperation to do my own games. Even though I am still 11 years old I like to program games.I think that its cool that you can pick players from real football to put on your team. All the backyard characters have there own personality and its really cool to talk to them. Another good thing about the series is that the games are really cheap. I think it is worth the money and you will play it for a long time with out getting bord. But if you do buy it I would suggest putting it on the hardest level so it will take longer to beat the game.
3,"Close, No cigar","This is an ok game but I wouldn't recomend buying it. First of all they have too many players at the same position. For example out of 10 players 6 of them are quarterbacks, 2 are runningbacks, and the final 2 are defensivebacks. Notice they dont have one wide receiver so you end up having Steve Mcnair(a quarterback) as your wide receiver. And second instead of Cade Mcnown as a quarterback maybe try Kurt Warner? How about Marshall Faulk instead of terell davis. But hey its a kids game so what do you exspect? Save your cash to buy Backyard Baseball 2003(comes out 6/11/02) trust me its worth the wait!"
3,Understanding how fixation runs our life,"This is a very good talk by Eli Jaxon-Bear on realization and how the Enneagram helps to show us the fixation of the ego and ""our"" habitual, automatic patterns. Shows even more clearly that they are not ours as they are shared by millions. The last third of the talk discusses many of the reasons I find the Enneagram useful in my personal growth and practice and my Life and Business Coaching.What it is not is a talk on the Enneagram, and it does not go into type descriptions or many details about the Enneagram. I would say the talk is best for those already familiar with the Enneagram and with a spiritual practice as well as students of Eli's."
5,Haley's Hints Help,"I grew up when my folks did most of this stuff as everyday practise. I subscribe to a newsletter that has some of these hints. However, this book is still worth money, and more. It's partly about saving money, recycling stuff giving it a second chance before hitting the garbage. Mainly for me, I hate running out to get something when there is something laying around the house that would do just as well. Whatever your angle for following these hints, money, the environment, or just wanting to save a bit of time; this is the book. Besides I like having a book in my hand instead of running to the computer every time something needs doing. Somethings I would never think of looking up. Like we have five cats, one have chewed through several of my headphone wires. The hint is to rub the cord with soap, cats don't like the taste. Now that saved me some money."
1,americans: grow up!!!,"people like me who are from europe always go like ""oh,oh, these americans he?"" wich is really happening about this thing these americans made up called ""the rules"". you see them all struggling SO hard to find a partner by using these rules and it's just SO silly that it makes you laugh out loud!! the first time I heard about this was while I was watching a documentary on tv not so long ago and everyone who saw it was like ""what the hell are these people doing over there???"" It's like watching a group of imbecils PLAYING A REALLY WEIRD GAME!!over here it's really easy, so what the hack there doing over there looks more like people who losts there mind...take a look how it goes over here and you'll see how easy it can be!!!"
2,Same old tired advice your grandma used to give,"I have heard that one of the relationship ""gurus"" is divorce which doesn't surprise me. A little cat & mouse at the beginning of a relationship is acceptable while a couple is trying to establish a relationship and still making up their minds about each other. But once a relationship has been established, I think it's time to get real. The author suggest that you keep playing games until the wedding day. I don't see how one could have a successful marriage, when your spouse never really got to know the real you during the courtship, but instead only got to know some mysterious character you were playing. I bought this book for curiosity's sake. I feel dumber for having read it."
2,Not as good as it used to be,"I originally purchased this product 7 years ago in a craft store for my very heavy back door. It propped open the door nicely. Overtime it has gotten dirty and I was glad to be able to replace it when I saw it was available for purchase on Amazon. This new one, same manufacturer and design, will not hold open my door. I weighed this one and it comes in at 2 lbs. I then weighed my old one and it weighs 3 lbs. If you need it for a light weight door, it would be perfect for you. If you need it for a big or heavy door, forget about it."
2,"Not the ""Best,"" not even ""Whiteman"" in some cases...","What can you say about a ""Best of Paul Whiteman"" disc that contains three tracks by Ben Selvin's Orchestra that were released, for reasons obscure, under Whiteman's Name... a fact not mentioned in the weak liner notes (although known by collectors for many, many years)? Sloppy, is what you can say. If you are a Whiteman completist, you'll buy this anyway, which I suppose is why Collectors' Choice expended so little effort in compiling and annoting this set. Ironic that the same lack of ""truth in advertising"" behind Columbia's 1928 deception should be repeated 80 years later! There are a few decent tracks alongside some of the WORST tracks Whiteman ever waxed (""Japanese Mammy""?! Ewwwwww!). If it's the jazzier side of the band that you're seeking (largely suppressed by Columbia upon his moving from Victor in 1928), you'll come up short here."
3,Trying to figure out where the 2nd work-out is,There's definitely one 30 minute work-out. But doesn't it say 2 complete work outs? The one is work-out is OK. But I was expecting 2.
4,Easy start to Tai Chi,"I became interested in Tai Chi as a means of increasing flexibility and strength, and as a means of relaxing, but not becoming an Orientalist. This DVD presents the basic movements in a manner that is slow enough for me to watch and learn. Matt Cohen gives relaxing, clear instructions with music that helps relax. I enjoy using this DVD and find that I am able to progress with the lessons."
2,Vitals cut off!,"After reading the reviews, I downloaded this video. However, the frame of the film itself is horrible. While you can easily see the hand movements, the poor instructor's legs and half of his face are cut off in the intro. (Even when minimized.) If you are truly to be connected ""to the root"", you also need to see the position of the feet and legs. You cannot.Despite that, the exercises are pretty good... for the hands. I wish I could see what his legs are doing, as I'm probably stressing them out just trying to do the poses.Having been instructed and practiced teaching martial arts myself, I would highly recommend another video. This needs to be re-edited and re-shot."
1,CT Fails Again,"I really wish my school would stop blindly assigning Course Technology books for their classes. Occasionally they're good, but more often than not (I'm on my 6th - 7th Course book), they're a terrible excuse for a college text - let alone if you're trying to learn a given subject on your own. This book is a perfect example. No need to go into specifics - the other reviewers are dead-on accurate. I just wanted to add my two cents - and my one star."
4,Metallica Loud,"All right now, James has no longer his killer raspy metallica voice, but the band has never sounded better! Don't get me wrong, I thought the Seattle concert from (binge and purge) was the best, but this concert has the killer sonics that the (binge and purge) concerts only wished for! So, get the others, but enjoy this extreme piece of METAL!!!! It's a loud piece of Metallicda history!!!!"
1,lack of sufficient information,"I have a Sony DVD Blu Ray player and it was not until the cd was open and in the player that I realized the cd could not be used on my player. There should be adequate information supplied before purchase that this cd is NOT compatible with Sony dvd players. Very ,Very disappointing and misleading, I think."
1,wrong item shipped,"not sure if it was intentional but i was NOT sent the item I ordered, instead I was shipped the wrong title from the same author"
3,CORO YOU LOVE CORO OR DONT I LOVE CORO !,THIS Shadows [CD-SINGLE]~ CoroWas ok i like ( CANT LET YOU GO & FALLEN ANGEL MUCH BETTER )...
1,It damaged my bras,The BraBaby does not function as claimed. The wholething came apart with the first wash. This device isway too flimsy.
2,very disappointed,"I had high hopes for the BraBaby, but they were quickly dashed when my $80 bra came out of the washer with snags all over the cups...and I so wanted it to work..."
1,Doesn't really work,The product does not state that any size over 36 C probably won't fit in the Bra Baby
2,Easier by hand!,"Unlike some, my Brababy hasn't broke (yet), but it is a hassle to use! The plastic it's made out of is very flimsy. Underwires are a chore to keep inside while you're closing the apparatus up. (If you're bigger than a D cup, forget using the Brababy) The straps usually stay hooked inside the inner ball, no problems there. It does take up alot of room in the washer, so don't put too many clothes in with it. I think I'll just go back to washing my bras by hand; much easier (as it usually takes me 5 minutes to get the bra inside the Brababy!)"
2,one broke at the first use,"It's good for its purpose but not resistant. The lock that close the ball broke in the first use when I tried to open. The other one worked fine. It's a cheap plast material, could be better and more resistant. But for now it's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras. Besides, this product is for medium and small bras. Who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the product"
5,From beginning to end this is a great book,"Life Interrupted is the book I wish had been available when my sixteen-year old sister gave birth to my nephew.I think had she had this she would have made wiser decisions for herself and her son. This book is a wonderfulblend of stories, resources, and pragmatic advice. The layout makes it easy to read and the chapter topics arerelevant to today's teens. I believe this book is not only for the moms who get pregnant, but for every teenagedgirl. Tricia Goyer has done a marvelous job of creating a resource that needs to be in every school in America aswell every church."
5,Excellent Resource for Young Moms,"Tricia Goyer knows what it's like to be a teen mom. Adding personal experience to meticulous research, she has created this invaluable resource for young moms and those who are close to them. This book resonates with truth, honesty, and encouragement. I highly recommend it!"
2,The Oxymoron of Intelligent Design.,"Intelligent Design is Intellectually Dishonest. These DVD's would be more appropriate in the Science Fiction category. These DVD's are just another collection of the Creationists endless asking of the same questions that have been answered time and again for the last century and a half by accredited scientists.If you're gonna watch this, be a mature adult and watch some REAL science from Neil deGrasse Tyson. Not only will you get the whole answer, you'll get some honesty.I give it two stars because the stuff is unintentionally hilarious. It is educational for the logical fallacies and would come in handy when teaching debating skills."
2,I'm Sorry,"I'm sorry, this recording does not stand-up with the Beau Brummels' earlier work. Many people think that this is a good example of country-rock! If you want real country-rock, listen to Poco or the Marshall Tucker Band or Graham Parsons (either solo or with the Byrds or the Flying Burrito Brothers) or even the Grateful Dead. The Beau Brummels were originally one of America's answers to the British Invasion and produced classics like ""Laugh, Laugh"" and ""Just A Little"". Here they're not anyones answer to anything."
3,okay,Volume 1 was so meaningful and colorful. I have been disappointed with then meditations as they just don't seem to tie God and nature the same way as Volume 1. I love volume 1
2,Who is this box for?,"I defy anyone to tell me what these 25 movies have in common--other than that they were produced/distributed by Universal Studios. This isn't a well-curated collection, just a bunch of movies that a lot of different audiences will like, but there is no audience who is going to have a taste for all of these films. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""Mama Mia!""? OK.... And if you can find me anyone who's going to finish ""Pillow Talk"" then pop in ""The Fast and the Furious,"" I'd love to meet him/her.Instead, this set seems to be akin to the world's most expensive box of chocolates--something for everybody, but nothing for any one person. It's something that a great aunt with a lot of cash would give as a birthday gift: ""I heard you like movies, so here are a bunch of movies."""
2,Not his better work,"Moved by Baukham's classic on Jude, I bought this book. First the grammer as intellectual as it sounds is not clear, it is more philosophical than theological. Then almost everywhere had a reference to Kierkegaard, why? It looked like a review of the opinions and works of Kierkegaard.The book certainly didn't deliver on the book of James which has a wealth of wisdom."
2,I need some TP,"I never really 'got"" the Butthole Surfers. I would always seem to pick up their albums, partly due to their underground ""buzz"" and partly because I love the name. And every time, I would basically play it once and shelve it. Quite simply, it just didn't rock! Maybe it wasn't supposed to. But in the mid-80's with stuff like ""New Day Rising"" out there this didn't hold a candle. So here I am now, and again finding myself purchasing a Butthole Surfers product, partly because of their reputation for legendary live shows (this being from their prime), and partly again because I like the name. And once again, I don't get it.It just doesn't rock. Sort of like why I never got into Sonic Youth. The buttholes are more like a noise/joke band, and perhaps I've missed the point all along. I mean, during one song the dude comes out with a tuba. What can I say, it's just not for me. Back to Zen Arcade."
4,Very Good True Story,"I really like this movie. I first viewed it on television many years ago and recorded it on VCR. It is a movie for family viewing, but should be edited some for young children. The fact that Steven was missing for so many years may be frightening to young children, as well as young parents. Since it is a true story, the viewer needs to understand that this is not an everyday occurrence."
2,Informative,"I purchased the book as I wished to discover just how good of a tennis player Big Bill Tilden was. This book was written by Frank Deford, a well respected sports writer. The information presented was incredibly well researched. All in all the book fulfilled my purpose in buying. However a picture of the chronology of Tilden's career and life was difficult due to the author's presentation. Finally Mr. Deford devoted entirely too many words/pages in defending Tilden's homosexuality. It was as if the book needed to be 'so many pages' in order to be published."
3,just a heads-up,"If you're a fan of the ""Somewhere Between the Train Station and the Dumping Grounds"" Cavity, the ""On the Lam"" Cavity, or even the ""Laid Insignificant"" Cavity, you may not find much to love here. the beloved Cavity vocalist, Rene Barge, who generally sounds as if he's rolling around in a mud puddle filled with broken glass, is sadly absent on this release. You'd think the music would be more or less the same, even without the trademark vocalist, but Rene's absence takes a huge amount of energy away from this album.It's a decent stone-metal album, but the lyrics are awful and the vocals are certainly lacking.Hopefully the recent release of ""Laid Insignificant"" will draw some more attention to this amazing act."
1,Mile Deep in Your Ear,"I suppose that the sound and noise-canceling quality of these are okay. However, they are so deep that they were painful to put into my ear for any extended period of time. I might as well have shoved a Q-tip down to my ear drum. I would avoid these if comfort is a concern when choosing ear bud style noise-canceling headphones."
1,I guess you get what you pay for,"There were so many negative reviews for the HN060 ear buds that I should have read before I bought mine. An old Yuban Coffee commercial had a line that went... ""you get what you pay for"". In this case it's so true. I only paid about $17 plus 6.80 shipping for my set so I didn't lose too much. Even at that price, I'm terribly disappointed. I got mine on e-bay and they were new in an un-opened package so it's not defective merchandise. The noise cancellation is extremely poor, you have to turn the mp3 player volume up to about max to get a decent sound. When you turn on the noise cancellation circuitry all it does, as far as I can tell, is boost the volume. Save your money and buy a real pair."
1,regret buying these,"i truly regret purchasing these headphones. they're not terrible but i would never consider them again and you shouldn't either. first of all, they don't stay in your ears. i've tried all three flange sizes and they always slip out, even when i'm sitting still. second, they have that annoying mechanism in the middle of the cord that's for sound cancelling. it's bulky and pulls out the earphones when you move around. they come with a strap to put around your neck to hold the mechanism up but that's so awkward! you have to walk around with this thing hanging around your chest. third, the electronic sound-cancelling makes a small hissing which takes away from the quality. the cancelling is decent and the sound reproduction is fine but it hisses! overall, not very good. which i had saved my money for a better pair (namelyEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator Earphones (White))"
1,Uncomfortable,"I never had a problem with earbuds before, but these are uncomfortable and are always slipping, so I end up jamming my fingers in my ears every few minutes to keep them in place. With the noise-canceling on, I still need to set my Ipod at full volume to hear it on an airplane (I usually prefer sound at a much lower level than other people). I've been using these for about 2 months now (the noice canceling feature does still work on mine at least) and I'm finally fed up with them... next stop: trash can."
4,"Works pretty well for me, but some faults","These noise canceling ear buds work pretty well under my helmet while riding, which is why I purchased them. I can see how their tendency to pop out of your ears without pressure to hold them in could bother someone using them in another scenario. They do a GREAT job canceling the engine noise from the bike.The unit also seems to be pretty easy on the batteries. For the price they are quite a good deal"
2,"Lot of fuss, no quality","The noise remover is a joke, the wires make everything clunky and difficult to manage, and the sound quality isn't that great for the price."
2,Ouch my ears,"For 50 dollar headphones, you'd think they could get the basics right. I can not STAND to have these in my ears. They are so uncomforatable. I can't even comment on the sound quality or it's ability to reduce ambiant noises because I can not bare to have these in my ears for longer than 10 seconds. Perhaps this is a personal thing, but for me, I could not wear them. 50 bucks gone."
2,Noise canceled permanently.,"Owned these for 11 months. Worked as described and did a good job of it until the right channel quit working. I think it was due to broken wire within the braid just after the amp/noise reduction unit. The braided sheath should have guarded against this, but, alas, it didn't."
1,"Worked fine first, but blew up in a month","I used these with my Treo phone/MP3 player for a month or two, in which period I flew a number of times. The product was okay, but whether it was real noise cancelation or just the creation of white noise (hiss) - I am not completely sure.The problem was that during my last flight I blew up the amplifier/noise canceling unit. Probably the sound level on the Treo was louder than the Philips unit could stand. I now have good sound in one ear but the other channel is dead.Also the silicone earbuds keep falling off. I am running out of replacement earbuds so this headphone is end-of-life.I will have to try to get a warranty replacement.(Update:) I live in Europe and had the item delivered to a US hotel when I was there. Now Philips Europe does not want to service it, but asks me to send it to the original seller. It's not worth the shipping cost, so I ordered Plane Quiets instead."
2,too heavy to carry,"This calendar had all the features I like, but was too heavy to carry in my purse. I donated this one, and purchased another..."
3,Nozzle was cracked.,"The nozzle was cracked on the can I received so it took the entire can to get the dispensing gun clean, just barely had enough with much of the solvent leaking out instead of all of it going through the gun. Wear nitrile gloves when working with expanding foam and the cleaning solvent!"
3,Okay but needed to be handled better,"Had the screenwriter and director handled this better, this story could have been stronger, more complete, and more organized. Even the performances could have been better than they were. By the end, Hopkins' character realizes that attacking people is not the way to get what one truly desires, especially when custody of a child is involved, but this is not handled in a very smooth way. Also, the weird fantasies and nightmares he has about smothering his son are not dealt with in a coherent fashion. As well, the movie comes off as strident rather than profound.I gave it three stars just because of the cast members and the attempt, which is so so but not terrible."
2,Quality Product (but now falling apart),"I purchased 3 of these plastic Arborvida plants in July of last year (2008). I was a little concerned about how they would manage outdoors during the winter, but they held up fine under all conditions.UPDATE: After less than four years outdoors, the sun has taken its toll on these plants. The plastic is now extremely brittle and the trees are falling apart. I thought they would have at least made it to five years."
5,Remixed!,"Fans of Lunascape around the world will love this Maxi-Single. Remixes of Lunascape's hit song 'Mindstalking' are upbeat and unusual, and the bonus remixes of 'Lane Navachi' and 'Yairo' add the perfect touch to this unusual compilation.ACIDplanet.com recently held a Lunascape remix contest for this particular song, so any fan interested in hearing other remixes should check out the 'contests' section of this particular site to listen to over 500 submitted remixes!Don't put this CD on repeat - you'll soon get a little sick of hearing the same song over and over again. Playing it with Lunascape's albums 'Reflecting Seyelence' and 'Mindstalking' make the perfect accompaniment.Banshee [lunascape.retrogression.org]"
4,A president's grandson,"Gavin Arthur was the gay grandson of President Chester A. Arthur. As you can tell from this book, Gavin was rather eccentric. My favorite bit from this book was the part where he explains that traditional Jewish circumcision involved an act which resembles gay sex. As strange as this sounds, and even if you never heard this before and assume that Gavin was crazy, the fact of the matter is that what he said was true. This has all sorts of interesting implications, especially if you think of Paul and Timothy in the Bible."
3,It's a hoot!,"I found most of the ironic and frightening tales within this book to be quite entertaining, though I had heard most of them before. Television and the media, especially MTV and VH1, have been all over this material for years. It was still fun to read about them all again, contained in one short volume. Though the book was a bit amateurish, grammatically speaking, the writer at least knew how to amuse, especially by making mountains out of molehills. It's all coincidences mostly, of course. I found it interesting that a reviewer had brought up the phallic symbol seen on old copies of Disney's `Little Mermaid', a legend the writer discounts. I've seen it too, as a family member had shown it to me a while back. They say it's unintentional (though I don't know how it could be), but it truly does exist on those old videocassette covers. It's just one of those comical things in life. This book is too."
1,Strange Fruit?....Strange Period!,"Great idea for a plot but, the acting was weak and the the actions taken to solve the case unbelievable."
4,Bitter Fruit,"I can't exactly disagree with some of the reviewers who have given this lower marks, some of the acting is atrocious, the script is too long, and because of the low budget technically it's grasp exceeds it's reach. I do however have to give the movie major props for not just spinning the same old cliches about Southern racism, as well as some really powerful performances, most notably from Berlinda Tolbert as a grieving mother who is hell-bent on finding her sons killers, David Raibon as the victim's brother and especially Kent Faulcon as the childhood friend of the victim, now a successful New York lawyer brought down to help solve the case. Faulcon is a true find: he does an amazing job of radiating the emotions his character feels returning to a home on which he has turned his back, and which has in turn turned it's back on him.The movie's grasp may exceed it's reach, but the film-makers and the leads definately deserve a shot at bigger things."
5,Pool Cover?,"We bought this pool last year for our kids. They are 12, 11, & 4. They love it! My 4 year old learned to swim, without being afraid because it's a good depth. The only bad thing is, is that I can't find a pool cover."
1,Granules are too small,The bird feeder that I got from Amazon has a wider set of nettings & the Wagner seeds are quite small & there is a lot of wasted grains - grains that fall on the ground & get wasted...
2,Overpriced,There's much better values out there for bird seed. Many stores sell a 20 pound bag of seed for nearly half that price.
3,3 stars. These are B-side quality.,"Over time, Sleater-Kinney has become one of my favorite bands. And I would recommend the CD Single of ""Get Up"" to anyone who feels the same way. Each of the songs on the CD is good. But none is great. They're all kind of catchy in that Sleater-Kinney way -- ""By the Time You're Twenty-Five"" has really grown on me -- but there's not a ""Little Mouth"" or ""Turn It On"" here. Buy it if you're a definite fan, and otherwise, check out the albums first."
5,Mustela is a must-have for newborn,"I love the smell. I love the foam. I love that it makes her cradle cap disappear. This is one of my favorite baby products. I bought the soap and face wipes after such a great experience with this, and I love them all. It's so much better for her than the J&J products which leave her skin and scalp dry."
4,Pros: lasts for ever. Cons: strong scent.,"I originally got this as a part of a baby shower gift, along with other products by Mustela. I have twins and they get daily baths. I use this shampoo only for their hair (and a Johnson bubble wash for everything else). This stuff lasts for EVER. I think the girls were almost 6 mo old when I finally had to order another bottle of this. It foams really well, keeps girls' hair super soft and clean. Never any irritation.My only complaint is that I think the scent on this product is rather strong, but the girls are used to it now and since it's a part of their bedtime routine, I don't want to change things up on them."
4,worked,This shampoo seemed to work. My baby had cradle cap and now she doesn't so that's what we were going for! The smell wasn't too strong but wasn't as pleasant as some baby shampoos. The foam is really nice so you can spot treat and the bottle goes a long way!
5,My favorite book,"I read this book and loved it. For me it was not a long book at all, even being 714 or so pages long . I loaned it to a friend and never got it back,but thru' the years I have always reflected upon reading when discussing books, so I decided to get another copy of it. It is my #1 book following Flowers For Algernon, and Just Say No."
2,Average at best,"Beau Brummels was a group with some great harmony in their hits and while from the US, really sounded more like a British Invasion group. I liked their hits but if you listen to their debut, you get the feeling that the group only had a few classics in them. Then came Triangle. Don't be fooled by all of the hype or 4 star average rating of this album. This is a mediocre album at best and not the classic that many reviewers believe it is. And I agree with a previous reviewer who felt that the vibrato became annoying. I'm a big music lover and I look for classic albums. I have most in my collection and many, like Rubber Soul or Blind Faith are albums that I would definitely miss if I could not hear them again. Don't get me wrong, this album is not bad but there isn't one song that blows me away and if I never heard this album again, it would not matter."
4,Good Album,"I was fortunate enough to see Robin Lane and the Chartbusters on 2 occasions while I attended college in New England. The second time I saw Robin Lane was 10 years later than the first time I saw her. Also, the lineup in each band was different in that not all of the original band members were present the second time. No matter, both shows were fantastic. Imitation Life is my favorite album by her, but this album is good. However, seeing the band live is best. The shows give off a sense of urgency and emotion that the albums (as good as they both are) just don't convey quite as well. I would love to see the band again. If you have not ever seen the band, then the albums are a good place to start. It's interesting, I bought her first album before I saw her show. After I saw the concert I knew that the album did not do the band justice as far as the music was concerned. However, if you like Robin Lane and the Chartbusters, buy all of their albums and EP's they are certainly worth having."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding Me,I took this author's course at CSUS back in 1991 and found him to be insufferably arrogant and cynical. He assigned this book in his class and I recall it being impenetrable. Pretentious rhetoric covering up incoherent arguments. I've noticed one of the used copies is going for $0.01. Overpriced if you ask me.
1,beware,"The dust ruffle from this set is not what it is cracked up to be! I washed it on gentle and it fell apart the first time! It never fit the crib right. It was almost 2 inches not long enough for a standard size crib. I had other issues with this set as well, I wouldn't purchase it again! No matter how cute it is."
5,very informative,The book was quite informative in giving the reader a look into sports that is not often mentioned.
4,nott scary enough,"This was not scary enough for me. i mean, it was a kid show But i expected Curtis (the bad guy) to be ReaLLY scary. He turned out to be nice. This movie was funny cuz it was like Night of the Lving Dead, but it just had the ghouls really funny looking and they acted stupid. The beginning was boring but the end was a real funny thriller"
4,Scarier than Stephen King!,"Although it drags a little in the middle, this book ought to be mandatory reading for any parent about to send his or her child to public high school. No discipline, no values, no integrity, little education. I work two jobs so that I can send my kids to private school. Reading this made writing the checks a thousand times easier. The lesson of this book: even if you have to live out of your car, avoid public education!"
1,Not Recommended,"I wanted to like this book, but honestly, I didn't find the kind of serious treatment of the important subject of the greeters ministry of a church. I would not recommend it for training greeters. Some of the examples in the book were strange if not fanciful. Like the directions about ""how to hug someone who doesn't want to be hugged"" or the greeter who was given a diamond ring by a guest. Try ""Serving as a Church Greeter"" by Leslie Parrott, Paul E. Engle"
3,More Form than Function,"I bought these knives to replace an old set from IKEA. Based on the reviews, product information, and name recognition, I was really looking forward to seeing a huge difference between these and my old knives. Unfortunately, I haven't. They're solid, seem to be of good quality, and come with a nice replacement guarantee, but they just aren't very sharp. I had to saw a little bit in order to pierce the skin on a tomato - something I wouldn't expect to have to do with brand new knives. Final word: look great, nice value, but not very sharp."
2,Eh... not really what I want in a knife set,All but one of the knifes are serrated. Its a decent set if your carnivorous but pretty non-ideal for cutting lots of vegetable. Manufacturing quality is good and high value.
4,We need a sequel!,"I, like many others, have read my way backwards through Kent Haruf's (too few) books since being mesmerized by Plainsong. Having just finished Where You Once Belonged, I am eager to have a sequel. I'm not sure whether Mr. Haruf reads the reviews on amazon.com, but just in case: Please help us get some closure on Jessie and Pat! The book ends quite abruptly, and it certainly left me anxious to know especially what would become of its self-posessed heroine and her two boys. To all of the rest of you, I recommend this, as I recommend any of Mr. Haruf's beautifully simple books. He has a gift for expressing the pathos and triumph of living everyday human life."
4,Nice collection of Vineyard worship,"This live worship recording is classic early 2000s Vineyard music -- best with friends or turned up loud, especially in the energetic first half and given the audible audience clapping and electronic band sound. The songs get slower toward the end, but still aren't what I would call 'quiet' or 'relaxing' ... I think there's a sense of striving and reaching out to a lot of Vineyard music.My faves on the CD are ""Creation,"" a bouncy song with a soaring female voice that glories in the natural word, and ""Father of Lights,"" which for me is a comforting classic. In general, I find the first half to be songs I find more engaging and familiar. Not the most outstanding CD but worth it if you like this type of music -- and the used CDs are quite reasonably priced."
2,Not a real mystery book,"This is the first time I've read this author. Perhaps her other books are more ""mystery"" than this one. I was greatly disappointed as the ""mystery"" had no real ending. Though the book was short, I still felt like I wasted my time reading it."
5,very pleased,"I have had this knife for three years now. I am a collector of fine knives and I can tell you this is the knife I prefer on my side. It is superbly engineered and an excellent design. The steel is excellent, the leather sheath is durable and well designed. I can quickly unlatch the button and have this knife in my hand, maybe you think this is not that important but I have been disappointed in knives where the sheath makes it too hard to get the knife in your hand. I have yet to sharpen it, very good quality steel. It is thick enough I can pry with it and not worry about it breaking. This knife made me a life-time believer in buck knives."
5,Great deal for the money,This was a superb buy. Cooks evenly and is well made just like the very costly other enameled cast iron.
5,"An Excellent Analysis with Solid Prescriptions for ""How To""","I have been reading this book and, at the same time, Customer Specific Marketing by Brian Woolf. Both a are great tools for anyone who is workign to crack the code. Truth is, he nails it. Focussing on maximizing and maintaining the value to the customer is - and should be - the holy grail for any business. This book has reignited my belief in this critical principle and has helped to get me focussed again on what we can do to continually improve the experience of our 17 million members."
2,CUTE BUT MY CAT WASN'T INTERESTED,"I thought my cat would love this because he likes toys he can carry around and this one actually has a little handle. But he was quite unimpressed, despite the fact that you can fill it with catnip. Still, it's adorable and maybe your cat would like it better than mine did."
2,Wont hold air,Product seems to not hold air. The air intake valves are the problem not a leak. Had problem the first time inflated. Customer service will not send a new one. I can just get a refund. I like the pool a lot. I has the features I was looking for that I couldn't find in a store. Want another one so I don't have to reinflate every day but evidently amazon won't do that.
1,Worthless,"This pool does not hold air. I inflated it twice, attached the valves correctly. It was flat in a matter of hours.Don't buy this pool. It is useless, cheap, a waste of plastic."
2,"Ripped in a few weeks, no drain plug","This pool looked great as it was being inflated. However, I was very disappointed to find that it had no drain plug. A pool this size is very heavy and difficult to drain by hand. The bottom developed a leak after just a few weeks of use. Definitely not recommended."
4,Good book for Little Girls,"This book is a good book for little girls. I wish I had some like this when I was growing up. The content is not magnificent and the themes are one dimensional, but this is what makes it so great. The simplicity of saying that we, as minority women, are beautiful and are sisters with all women because without us, there could be no world.To a girl, that's saying a lot!The pictures are very nice as well."
3,"Energizing, erotically charged","Great story. Good action. Emotionally captivating, yet strong and explicit. It is great that the directors are not afraid to reveal explicit male sexuality. Men do get sexually assaulted too you know!."
3,A strange movie,"It's difficult to speak about a movie so strange. When I saw Spetters, I thought that the director was a genius. He maked some scenes very hard, but without courtesy. The story too was very interesting. The director, infact, become very important and famous."
5,It's amazing,"I love paul verhoven's movies after seing The 4th Man and Flesh and Blood. So i tried to check this one,it's amazing. It potraits of dutch youth in 80's period. It has complex story about friendship, ambition, and sex. Well done for the actors and actress, and so for directing. It's suprising, this movie contain full frontal nudity, and explicit oral sex. Just check it out!"
3,unusual mystery debut that's good but flawed.......,"Ellis Portal-a once powerful lawyer/judge who, through a mental breakdown, loses everything and becomes homeless and a self imposed ""hermit""-is the anti hero of this new mystery series. Ellis lives isolated in the Canadian wilderness right off of Ontario. After finding a severed black hand with a rare ring on it, Ellis becomes drawn unwillingly into a mystery involving both his transient present and is upper echelon past.As a mystery, I'd give the book a 3.5-pretty interesting but Ellis' investigation was flawed at best. As a mystery hero, Ellis was much more fleshed out and equally sympathetic and morally bankrupt. While the plot did have some fairly large holes, the solitary musings and struggles of Ellis were thought provoking and magnetic to follow.Not the best I've read but I'll still try the other books in this series.3 stars"
5,Great Buy!,"This set has been a very welcome surprise. Once we purchased the crib set, we were able to visit many other stores (fabric and craft stores mainly) and found additional fabric, wall murals, etc to match it completely. There are even clothes that have the same patterns on them. Can't wait to finish off our nursery for our baby (who's due in Feb)."
3,what about the girls?,"My sister is having a girl... She loves the blue jean bear, but why dont they make a blue jean girl bear, like wearing a blue jean dress. If they do make them please help me to locate a set...."
5,my favourite.,"I have all 5 of Tori's albums and Boys for Pele is my favoruite. Really, I can't decide if Choir Girl or Pele is my fav but i love all of Tori's albums. Tori is such a genius and such a great songwriter. My favorite Tori song on Pele is Professional Widow. Ignore those stupid critics, this is a great album!"
2,disappointed,"I absolutely love Tori's other CDs but I've found this one impossible to get into. The tunes aren't catchy like Choirgirl Hotel, and the words make NO sense. I'd say save your money for Choirgirl Hotel or Little Earthquakes, they're much better."
1,Talented artist seriously stumbles on her thrid go around,"The first pair of Amos' albums proved her to be a vital and talented artist - a writer of gorgeous melodies, startling lyrics, and imaginative musical arrangements. Unfortunately on her third go around she is dangerously close to self-parody with an unfocused piece of work that does little to alter her growing image of a self righteous, humorless, man hater (the later of which is reinforced by the album's title and cover photo) who sadly just may be running out of musical ideas. While songs like ""Blood Roses"" ""Talua"" and ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" hint at the promise of her first two albums, far too many others undercut the momentum Amos gained with her debut and its follow up.If you still think you might be interested in this CD, save the dough and hit the used CD bins first. I run into this one all the time there."
3,thought-provoking...,"I must say that I neither like nor hate this album as a hole. Some songs, such as Hey Jupiter, Talula, In the Springtime of His Voodoo, Marianne, and Mr. Zebra, I just love. Tori obviously was trying to do something here, and I understand that perfectly, but I can't listen to this album all the way through because I lack patience in all areas, not just where this album is concerned. Some people love this album, and some people hate it, but this fact in itself makes this a good album."
5,a tori fan's MUST HAve,Tori gives up her solitary piano for a spectacular album. Her voice is full of emotion and pain.It is depressing but uplifting. Hey Jupiter is teary/beautiful. and Doughnut Hole is the best song ever. I give this the top rating because that is what it deserves.
1,"I Love Tori, But Hate This CD","Let me start by saying that I think Tori's first album ""Little Earthquakes"" is a masterpiece. There is not one bad song on it. Her second ""Under the Pink"" is good and definitely worth having, but can't equal the majesty of the first. ""Boys for Pele"", however, is awful. I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews for this CD. You people obviously haven't listened to ""Little Earthquakes."" You are missing out. ""Boys for Pele"" can't hold a candle to it. I'm giving ""Boys for Pele"" 1 star because there is one (and only one) good song on it and that is ""Putting the Damage On"". That song is excellent. Otherwise, you can have this CD.Please do not make this your first Tori Amos purchase. Buy ""Little Earthquakes"" then ""Under the Pink"" and then, if you must, ""Boys for Pele""."
5,The BEST,"This is truly Tori's best album. I like to listen to it with a glass of wine and get into the music. I feel like the album is like a story. Kind of like the stroy of a girl who learns how to live without her love one. It has it all, sad songs (Hey Jupiter), angry songs (Professional Widow), happy songs (Mr Zebra), melancolic songs (Horses)... It is absolutly the best. I recomend to play it loud and play it a few times before making judgment. The first time I heard it I didn't like it that much, but after listeninc again and again, it was truly the best."
1,'Hooked on Phonics' DIDN'T work for Tori,"Where the heck did Tori learn how to enunciate? Ms. Amos, let's have a quick language refresher. Today's lesson: vowels.a: the long 'a' (as in ""save"") should be pronounced just like the name of the vowel ('A'), not 'EYE'.e: the long 'e' (as in ""we"") should be pronounced just like the name of the vowel ('E'), not 'AY'.i: the short 'i' (as in ""wish"") should be pronounced like a short 'i', not like ""EEEEE"".Now let's try it. Say, ""We wish for Tori to stop this, okay?""Tori's response:""WAY WEEESH FOR TORAY TO STOP THEEEEEEEES, O-KAEYE?""*shakes head*You get the point, folks. Tori's over-stylized ""slacker accent"" may appeal to the emo crowd, but for the rest of us it gets downright annoying. If I want to hear bizarre accents I'll listen to Bjork. I don't need some North Carolina girl inventing new ways to butcher her native tongue for the sake of gimmickery. That is all. lol."
2,Not her best,"Apart from ""Horses"" and ""Caught a Lite Sneeze"", this album is somewhat disapointing. It doesn't have the strength of Choirgirl or the emotion of Earthquakes. The harpsichord wears out its welcome after only a couple songs and becomes less intriguing and more repetative. This album was certainly a departure for Tori, but I think it's time to come back now."
2,A huge disappointment to a huge Tori fan.,"I am a huge fan of Tori Amos - I have been since the days of Little Earthquakes. She is a stunning song writer and singer - probably my favorite out there. But I was terribly disappointed with this album. She seems to swing too far in the direction of self-consciously deliberate ""alternativeness."" While it is an interesting musical exercise, and perhaps we should appreciate it as artistic growth that allowed Tori to reach the heights she does in her most recent album, ""Songs from the Choirgirl Hotel,"" the album comes off as almost pretentious. I ended up selling my CD back to a used CD place. If you want to hear Tori at her best (which is a truly magical musical experience), get either ""Little Earthquakes,"" her first, or ""Choirgirl Hotel."" A disappointing musical experience overall!"
4,Guardedly delighted,"I purchased this product with some trepidation because the other reviews I saw called it tinny and junk. But it was sold through enough reputable places and offered such a promising solution to my aged and cheap (""I'm not going to pay $5000 for a hearing aide; how many years do you think I have left?"") aunt's hearing loss that I decided to give it a try. My aunt is virtually deaf, but this product could be turned so loud that she asked me to turn it down. For the first time in two years I could carry on a normal-voice-level conversation; I didn't have to scream in her ear. And her perception of what I said was 100% accurate as opposed to about 50% when I was screaming.The product does not strike me as very durable, but it is not junk either. So far -- a few weeks of irregular use -- it has been 100% reliable."
4,Works Fine,"I bought this for my mom. She likes it quite a bit. It provides more amplification than she needs.I also bought her the ""Stealth Secret Sound Amplifier"" and she's decided she likes that one a bit better - sound is better for her and her hair hides it pretty well.Both devices amplify the surrounding sound, so I suspect it's completely dependent on her precise hearing loss."
4,Clarity Personal listener,"The Clarity is a fair device to try for trouble hearing in crowds or around ambient noise. Next best thing to an in ear device. Bugaboos of the device are: The little microphone cover falls off easily and is lost, requires frequent tone dial changes depending on speech from males or females, does not come with a convenient method of wearing around the neck (which is most likely where you'll want to wear it). Overall I do not regret the purchase. It has helped me immensely in my frequent meetings, allowing me to hear people all around a large room."
1,Disappointed!,"If I could give this product the equivalent of a negative star rating, I would. It didn't work out-of-the-box. No power. Flimsily made. I had purchased for my elderly mother and needed it to work for her short visit to convince her of the need for a more permanent solution to her loss of hearing. Don't buy this product."
2,Garnet ring,"This ring is pretty which is why I bought it, but the the band metal is so thin it uncomfortable to wear. It cuts in between my fingers making it painful to wear."
1,Don't waste your money,I installed these on a 2004 Durango and found them completely worthless compared to factory installed systems that I've had on previous cars. I ended up buying a rear view mirror camera combo that worked incredibly well. These only beeped when I was a foot away from something. I was very disappointed in the product
2,"It sounds good, but with a DED display",The LED displey stoped working the second time i turned my car on after installing the sensor system. But it still sounds good!
1,"Very bad product, very bad experience","It came with all of the sensors damaged, so I had to buy a new one in my country because there are no spare parts for this, cos I'm not at USA I had waste 31,20USD and now I only have 6.24USD that they refund me and I have a useless device on a box even it was new. Bad experience, very bad experience."
2,The two singles I love do not represent the full album,"STP's two singles that received massive rotation on radio stations (""Trippin' on a Hole"" and ""Big Bang Baby"") are the only reasons to purchase Tiny Music. I bought this album expecting the rest of the songs having the same guy singing in a unique, scratchy yet high-on-the-octave-scale voice (as the two singles would have you believe), but what I got from the rest of the tracks was what could best be described as very Vedder-derivative. As it turns out, it was just a cool vocal effect that was applied to Weiland's voice on only those two tracks. What a rip off. If you heard those two awesome singles, and had Purple in your possession, you wouldn't believe it was the same Stone Temple Pilots. Everything but the two songs I'm very fond of went by in the blandest, stereotypical mid-90's rock blur imaginable. I give Tiny Music two stars for two great songs, but guys, stop the false-advertising!"
2,Please resist the temptation to buy this,"Now, before I write this let it be known that I like the Stone Temple Pilots. I own all their albums now, and I really liked their other three. That much said, all STP fanatics should buy this album, but if you're just a casual STP fan like me then stay away from it.Some of the music is good. ""Pop's Love Suicide"", ""Tumble in the Rough"", ""Trippin'On A Hole In A Paper Heart"", ""Art School Girl"", and ""Adhesive"" are all good songs overall. But this album on the whole is a pretty bad album, I'm sorry to say. I don't know who that is singing, but it sure doesn't sound like Scott Weiland. Not on one song. Some songs sound like they belong a pretty album.I'm not trying to diss STP. I like them. I'm just writing to you as a concerned reviewer who just wasted $18 on a CD. If you really feel compelled to buy this album, download some songs from Napster first and try it out. Fanatics may want it, but it's not for the average grunge fan."
4,"Different approuch, same quality","Despite the difference in sound, there's no mistaking STP. This album provides a more pop-rock approuch than the first two albums. With songs like Trippin on a Hole in a Paper Heart, and Seven Caged Tigers, it seems that Scott Weiland's problems with booze and drugs have in no way affect the quality of this album."
2,I've heard much better from STP,"A sharp contrast with the Core CD, this one from STP is definitely the worst out of all three. Although many of the songs are clever and fun, I was really disappointed after listening to this CD because I found none of the good, old, Stone Temple Pilots on it. I think that, in their effort to soften up, they've altered their music way too much, for the worse. A lot of people are whining that they were too grundgy and wanted some classic rock style music from them, but if you want classic rock, listen to Hendrix or Zepplin. Personally, I liked the Stone Temple Pilots a lot better before, and their Core CD holds as one of my most prized ones on my CD rack."
3,Large enough,"3 1/2Fine third disc (probably the last one) from the Pilots where they toned down some of the more hard rock in favor of organic roll. The results aren't usually as spectacular as their most powerful punches, though nearly as consistently appealing."
4,"Good, but not their best","This one had to grow on me. I am a huge STP fan. I have all of their CDs, but this one is more than a little bit quirky compared to the rest. Maybe some of the band members had other things ON their minds when they made this one. Eventually I grew to like it just as much as the others. Now, I can't imagine STP without 'adhesive', which happens to be my album favorite. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, but maybe tell them to have a drink first to keep an open mind."
1,Not a Long Term Solution,"This doghouse was only useful for two years before it self-destructed in my grassy dog lot. I would try something like an ""igloo"" or a ""K-9 Coop"" next time, but if you keep your Four Paws house on a porch it should last longer."
5,My black lab loves his new house!!,"My black lab loves his new house! When I was assembling it, I thought it might not be as durable as it should be, but after being fully assembled it has remained very sturdy and durable!!Also, the assembly is VERY EASY!! You just have to connect a few sides and tops and you're done!!The color was not cream and red, as is pictured, but rather is cedar (varnished) with a green top. However, nonetheless, VERY NICE!!"
5,The Illuminating Tea Party,"Released in conjunction with their ""Tangents "" cd, ""Illuminations"" is the very first DVD compilation from Tea Party. The fourteen tracks on this disc comprise the major label video history of the trio, including the Australian-only vid for ""Shadows On The Mountainside"", which was previously available as part of the computer portion of ""Alhambra"".This is truly a fan's treat as the extras on the dvd include band commentaries, a discography, lyrics & biographies, and an audio- only option. Options also include a choice of 2.0 stereo sound, DTS, or 5.1 Dolby surround sound to enhance listening enjoyment.While long-time fans may be disappointed that the vid for the indie single, ""Let Me Show You The Door"" wasn't included, the disc more than makes up for it by adding behind the scenes coverage of the making of the video for ""Walking Wounded"". The video history of Tea Party is available now and is truly an illuminating experience.CHRIS"
4,A Great Performer,"Paige is a wonderful performer, singer and interpretor. She sings the great songs but the orchestration sounds the same on each song, as if played from the same synthesizer. She's great and stands alone...her support system is very weak!"
5,Elaine's Excellence is Obvious in Encore,"This is an incredibly eclectic, and strong mix of Elaine's work. The power of her voice is obvious in the tracks from ""Piaf"" as well as ""Sunset Boulevard."" Also enjoyable is the reworking of ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall."" Encore is not only powerful and well done, but fun to listen to."
4,Well done!,"This CD is an excellent choice for a new fan of Elaine Paige, or one who would like a 'best of' compilation of her musical theater songs. Many of them are the best interpretations I've heard of them, her unrelenting voice hits the notes dead on, without any pretense. Of particular note are her ""Sunset Boulevard"" selections, which makes me wish there was a complete CD of that with her available. The only reason five stars was not awarded here is because some of the orchestrations have too much of a pop quality to them, as in ""I Dreamed a Dream"" and ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". But obviously the main focus here is her voice, and for that I easily award five stars."
4,Dad's Navy,"My father served aboard the 'Frankford,' a 'Gleaves'-class destroyer, during World War 2. Dad is gone twenty years and better now, but I wish I had been able to show him this book while he was still around.He was never a great reader, but I think he would have been drawn along through the eight stories in the (really rather slim) volume. And then he likely would have told me that one of them was an obvious sea-story and a couple of others were far-fetched. But that Mr. Forester seemed to know a little bit about what it takes to install radar on a old destroyer that was never intended to carry that sort of thing. (Dad was a signalman on 'Frankford,' and made his living working on radar for the Air Force after the war.)They're mostly gone now and even their kids are getting long in the tooth. Forester's little book is an educational (and entertaining) look back at the Men Who Saved the World.I may need to point this book out to Dad's grandsons. They never got to meet him."
1,This product SUCKS!,Recently purchased two Plye 5.8 inch lcd headrest Tv's. Both are same model number but are two different tvs. They have two totally different menu functions and two different pictures that can't be matched. Horrible product do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money. They are cheap but suck.
5,This book will change your life!,"This is the book we have all been waiting for, the Magnum Opus of all Health Books. Never before to this extent has there been a book that contained TRUE and natural healing like Basil Gold's ""Not on the Evening News"". This is a book NO home should be without! My health has improved dramatically using simple foods and inexpensive techniques. This book will save your life if you are ill, or drastically improve the quality of your life if you are not. Highly recommended!"
3,Disappointing contents...,"This glossy book of about 90 pages has very clear pictures. However, nowhere in the book does she state what her art, 'mctavishing', is. Most of the pictures are of meandering stitches which one could quite easily obtain from the very excellent book for beginners by Maureen Noble. The bonus is in the DVD where Karen shows how to backtrack on an already drawn line/curve."
2,mmmmmmmmh?!,"Ok it just tells you things you want to hear about yourself, but do you really get this self confidence developped? Not really!"
2,Ehh,"I have three hypnosis CDs, and out of all of them, this is the one that never gets used.They drag out the hypnosis too long, repeating the same generic phrases over and over.I do not think they put tons of thought into this product, since there aren't anyspecific confidence building sentences within the session. It just relaxes you.I do not recommend buying it, and wish there was a good one out there.Have not found it yet!"
3,Showcase of yet another successful R&B then-princess,"If I give 3 stars to this video collection, the credit of 2 stars actually goes to her videos from the 2nd to 3rd albums, SECRETS and THE HEAT.If you really know how to appreciate this 90's R&B; princess with a curvy butch figure in a husky womanly voice you'd skip most of her 1st album videos straight to YOU'RE MAKING ME HIGH, UNBREAK MY HEART or HOW CAN AN ANGEL BREAK MY HEART. Toni has mixed all the glitz and glamour with her seductive lyrics, sexy vocal, curly hairdo, bodyhugging outfit and fairly videography tales to the max and probably the best ever projected in a beautiful American Black woman.Check out the final SPANISH GUITAR, it'll make every straight guy out there shiver with an anticipation!"
4,Almost too heavy duty,"Very solid. I use a rigger's belt without the anchor point for everyday use, and thought this would come in handy for attachments of tools, lowering stuff from the grid/roof, etc., but most of the time that big honkin steel triangle was just in my way. Definitely good quality, and appropriate for certain situations."
5,Blackhawk...Need I say more?!?,Anyone that knows anything about Blackhawk or their line of products already knows that the name speaks for itself. Needed a solid belt for my dropleg holster and molle. The belt holds up just as I expected it to; like a champ!
4,Looks and feels sturdy,"Received this item. The belt is secured by Velcro folded over the buckle. I ordered large size and I did measure it and from the end of the Velcro to the buckle is 52 inches. I have 42 inches waist but the Velcro that is folded over to secure the end is only 9 inches, there is still another 9 inches of Velcro to be mated. So I thought if the whole 18 inches in my case, of Velcro is mated it would be more secure. The material itself I think is light but strong. I will use this belt to hook up to my lanyard. 4 stars because the velcroed part is not long enough in my case, to mate with all the velcro's length, although I ordered the longest available."
2,on/off button is a turn off!!!,"My 17 month old loves the Wiggles, so I thought the microphone would be perfect. But whoever designed this toy really wasn't thinking and I can't believe it made it to the assembly line this way. The ON/OFF botton is right where you hold it. My daughter is consently turning it off by accident and gets very frustrated. I will say it is durable, she has thrown it a million times and it has held up. I also bought her the guitar, I would give that 5 stars and suggest it instead of the microphone."
3,It's pretty good,you have to have the perfect snow fall to be able to have the right quantity and consistancy of snow to create a fort.
2,Okay but not great,"This worked okay when I put it on my husband's safety glasses but lousy when he tried to put it on. He tried to glob it on the way they do on TV and messed up his glasses. I had to take the stuff off and reapply. It really does not get rid of the scratches, just makes them less noticeable to other people."
1,Didn't work at all-made it worse,"This product almost ruined my daughter's glasses. We followed the directions to the letter and got horrible results. Instead of getting rid of the scratches on the lens, it left brush marks that were impossible to see through. I don't recommend this to anyone."
3,"A Decent Book, But...","This is a decent book, outdated as was expected, but WAY overpriced. The information will allow you to build a dome greenhouse, but the result, if following the book, will look rather shabby by today's standards. This is to be expected from the time it was written, but it still comes down to the cost. I am keeping the book and might try the design, but with modifications in materials. If it had been a reasonable price I would have given 5 stars."
2,Bad band can't replace in stores have to order for 20.50+shp,I only had this watch 2 months and the band broke!In my sleep!I went to every store in the malls and others No One has this special band and all of the casio watches Ive had recently have the same band but just different enof so they cant be swithed! I finnally foun one online after finding out the model # one the back lacks one letter it should have. andthey want $20.50+ shipping The watch band sucks but I rather like the watch exept for the way the hands canget off even though the digital is right and the day light savings time setting sucks.
1,One long boring movie,I recorded this on my DVR service it long and boring and fails big time in holding viewers attention. After about 30 mins I hit skip forward and until I got to end and it was just more of the same. I hit delete once it got to credits it only at best a 1 star movie I give it 2 if it been in color & not the very poor quality grainy B&W format.
3,rare experience seeing Rock Hudson's acting abilities,"Bought this for a friend who had been trying to find it for several years. Supposed to be Rock Hudson's better roles in his acting career. I enjoyed all the parts he played in this movie and he was pretty darn good, especially when he got really inebriated; however, the story line was in the weird catagory for me and that alone turned me off on the movie as a whole. I would call it a fantasy to be able to relive your life again and again, but maybe it was really a ""Ghost story..."" Perhaps the title meant second chances at life...who knows except the writers...."
5,The best tool to sell your house,"When we decided to sell our own home, we thought it would be wise to get advice from an attorney. Well, we found it where we least expected: from a book written by Joseph DiBlasi, Attorney at Law. This book taught us to determine the value of our home, when to advertise, how to negotiate, and - last but not least - how to prepare the right contract. DiBlasi must be a very experienced real estate attorney. Go by his advice! It helped us tremendously."
2,Not very impressed!,I bought this CD because of all the great reviews. You people need to get out more often!
4,Unparralled Immersion for a mystery adventure game,"When this game first came out many many years ago, I had experienced nothing like it..For the first time in my video game playing experience, I felt as if I was truly the character on screen, and the people who's goal it was to put you into the shoes of this p.i. tex did an extremely well job and will be remembered in the history of video games for their innovative style of storytelling combined with investegating..One of the best detective games around..."
5,Great CD!,This is one of the best hypontherapy cds I have. The british voice is very relaxing and the music is beautiful. One side guides you through a tour of your dream car and dream home. There are affirmations that pan from one ear to another and slowly fade away. Both side one and two are 24 minutes long.
4,worth trying,"The voice is soothing, it takes little time a day. I don't know if I have yet reaped any discernible financial benefits, but I do know that it's worth a try and that it is relaxing and gives great affirmations that alone should help make new and better habits. I think I'm relearning how to save and not impulse-buy as often. Overall, worth the money to try it. Just make sure you keep doing it for at least a month to see if it benefits you; it is not immediate, hypnosis takes time as you're altering habits that have been there fore years and changing your frame of mind.I really like this product and I enjoy Glenn Harrold's voice. Not a scary thing at all, and I've listened to it without relaxing completely, and he's not giving you weird subliminal messages or anything, which I find comforting!"
4,We Get to See Cabot Cove!!,"The first episode on this tape is an average, enjoyable Jessica Fletcher story. But the second one is a treat! It's one of the few episodes that features the town of Cabot Cove, Maine, with quite a bit of outdoor scenery for a change. If I recall correctly, a California town is the actual filming site, but it works! Additionally, there's a rather sad and unexpected twist to the ending making this one of Jessica's best mysteries."
3,Season one was better,"Only has 4 storys in different episodes. And all of them are ones that happened durring or in between episodes from season one. Only the first and last are good. Their is one called ""Endless Eight"" it is 8 episodes of them doing THE SAME THING over and over and over and over..... The only difference is outfits. Turnes out they are stuck in a time loop and have been for almost 600 years. Poor Yuki can remember every single day of it.. It turns out what haruhi wanted to do was have a homework party...... 600 years for poor yuki and all she wanted was to hang out and do her homework. I wouldnt have paid so much if i knew it would suck so much. i guess its nice to say i own it but the first season is deffinatly better."
5,Haruhi Suzumiya,The second season of the melancholy of haruhi Suzumiya was everything I expected. Amazing that's all I have to say.
4,endless 8,i really do like the series but my only problem is with the endless 8 episodes. it's only 14 episodes long and #2-9 are almost the same episode with a few changes but the other episodes are great it would be great if there was another season coming out.
5,Great book for many ages & levels of knowledge!,"This book remains one of the best that I have found for someone developing more than a casual interest in squirrels.Book is broken into three sections - the ground dwellers, tree squirrels and gliders. Twenty nine illustrations and information on distribution, descriptions and other pertinent info. Book is better for someone who is interested in reading about squirrels than it is for someone looking for a field guide (book has no photos, just some very nice illustrations).For several species the author has created fictionalized accounts (based on sound data) of aspects of their lives, into which are artfully drawn the other animals whose existence is ecologically entwined. Includes an extensive references section.Book is written on at least a high-school reading level (at least when I went to school!)."
3,battery tender,I bought this to keep my mowers Gel battery charged and it seems to be doing the job. I wanted to keep it charged so I could use the mower that has a snow blade on it to plow my large driveway. We haven't had much snow yet so I don't really jknow if the battery has enough juice to start the mower.
4,good battery charger,present for my dad. he has not complained about it yet. he has had some other battery tender models burn up .
1,What warranty?,"I purchased this product in February of 2011 and it seemed to work fine. It says that this model can be used as a battery charger and it will change from charge mode to float/maintenance charge mode without damaging the battery like trickle chargers. In July of 2011 it just stopped working while it was connected to my classic car battery in float/maintenance charge mode. Of course I bought this model for its 10 year warranty, but now I find out that in addition to having to pay to ship it to the company, I also have to pay $15.95 for them to do Warranty Evaluation, & shipping & handling fees. When you pay $47.00 for an item and it costs you around $30.00 to pay for shipping & return shipping, what is the point of the warranty? This is supposed to be ""the best"" of battery chargers and they basically want me to pay for anything done to the unit. I am not impressed!"
1,Carrie Underwood and Some Hearts,"Bad album, bad album. She could've at least tried to put some effort forth in making a decent album."
1,Dreck,"This is what you get when Nashville's Music Row and American Idol converge in an unholy crossroads of content manufacturing. Can Ms. Underwood sing? Undoubtedly. But like many contemporary sirens her pipes are wasted on market-tested fodder and aural wallpaper. If boredom had a sound it would be this.You want a female country artist? Pick up Loretta Lynns latest ""Van Lear Rose"" or Mary Gauthier's ""Mercy Now"". For some new bloods check out anything by Allison Moorer, Neko Case and the Dixie Chicks."
5,Her Best,This CD is farvher best effort of all. Been a follower since Idol and fell in love with her voice on the show.
5,This girl is a STAR!! *****************************,"I have been a fan of American Idol for the past three years. I never much cared for Kelly Clarkson or any of the others as being 'stand out performers' as declared! But when Miss Underwood came along - I saw the Class, Talent, Beauty and her bright and shining future! And get this! I don't like Country music! I purchased this CD and loved it! And - I will purchase all of her future CDs!! Her voice seeps into your inner soul! Now, for the record, I think Chris Daughtry is awesome as well - have not purchased his CD (yet) tho!"
5,Some Hearts by Carrie Underwood,Carrie writes and sings great music. Well produced. Good sound. Good listening.
3,Definately Recommended,"I bought this album for my sister and pretty much only for the song Jesus Take The Wheel, which I love! I didnt think I would like the rest of it as I am not much of a country music fan, BUT I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoy this album, so I would definately recommend this to all country music fans and anyone else who just feels like something different! I even got my neice bopping away to it and that is saying something!"
3,not a surprise,"unlike bo's cd, carrie has released an album exactly like what i expected. thank god it's the country pop music that i like. when i first listened to the songs i could easily imagine them being soundtrack to movies (like kelly perhaps?). i do enjoy listening to her songs.however, i still think carrie is boring (sorry die-hard carrie fans). her voice is good and she can definitely sing very well - but i've heard her type before. and they fade into the background for me. carrie's singing does not add anything to the songs. thats why despite the good album, i'm only giving it a 3."
5,Amazing voice...but just an ok song,songs choice all not nice..i hv to say that..it's a collection of boring songs..really boring..but she has the ability to turn bad songs into good..she sung it..sung it well..good job Carrie!For that i give her 5 stars!
2,pretty bad,"Kind of a disappointment. I must admit I'm not an idol fan, but this album sounds more like a pop album to me. I can listen to a couple songs, but that's it."
1,Awful album.. worse than Hilary Duff!!!,"I didnn't think it was possible, but she managed to do an album that was worse than Hilary Duff's latest, Most Wanted. Every song on here is abysmal. I would suggest that this country dragqueen stop singing before her ugly face is shown all over the TV as the ""loser of the year"""
1,oh my goddd,"I hate britney spears look alikes they always offer bad music. I hate country music too. And good god, if you're going to sing about jesus at least wear a top over your bra carrie! I'm surprised no christian fanatics have protested over her album cover already!"
1,To the person who keeps writing 5 star reviews...,"You should just stop. Everybody knows its just one person. You make it obvious because none of them are real names and none have anything impressive about them. Now, to the album. Wasted is excellent. Some Hearts is alright, the rest stink. Buy or Not: NOT."
1,She sucks,its obvious that some stupid idiot is making repeated accounts and giving her 5 stars. What a loser. Don't be decieved by this. This CD really sucks hard. She sounds like a sad oaf who needs help eating her grains. Wasted is the worst song ever!
2,Average music&a Cute chick,"America Idol has been able to push alot of slick Acts that fit into there own Boxes which is cool for the purpose it serves,Problem is it's hard to forecast who is actually gonna have a long term career.Carrie Underwood has a nice voice&is a Nice looking chick,but this Album is too Polished for it's own good. I believe that for any Artist just starting out you need to have your flaws&work on them,but they are needed for Growth. Carrie Underwood has a chance to have a decent run,but I get the feeling that the Record company might make Her into a Faith Hill type in training. this album doesn't really have any material that stands out,but vocally she has some nice moments."
5,Bravo!,Carrie Underwood surprised me with her debut album! The entire album is so cool! I just love her voice so much! Beautiful job!
1,I don't like Some Hearts!,"She did a bad job on Some Hearts, all she did was scream and yell! Better luck next time.."
5,Very Good!,"Carrie has the best woman vocal from the show 'American Idol'. This debut album shows it. What I like most about it is you can hear her voice very clear and that means she has total control over the songs. Plus there are mix of different type of songs, different emotions. She is capable of doing country and pop or even rock, that is very unique in current music industry. Other AI contestants appearently need loads of promotion here or there, but Carrie will shine through no matter what."
5,Carrie is awesome,"I Love Carrie Underwood so much! She has the best voice and seems like the nicest person! She definitly deserved to win American Idol! Keep up the excellent work, Carrie!!!!!!!!!!!11"
5,"KellBell is amazing, Carrie even more so!!!","I love this album!!! It's just great to listen to. I don't like country, but I like this! I had faith in her. I was hoping she would so something impressive like Kelly did and she did Kelly one better! Way to go Carrie! You're da bomb!"
1,"i don't like her music at all,not one little bit!","She needs to stop hurting my feeling with her music. It's all depressing, similar tracks. that's why you're basicaly buying this for 10 dollars when its worth about 2 because you're really only getting one song. They all sound so similar. Take my advice and don't buy this."
3,Well...it's not a classic,"This was an ok album, but it's not a classic...by far. The album pretty much dragged on after the first track, and the only songs that were actually worth listening to were, ""Jesus take the wheel,"" ""Some Hearts"", ""I ain't in Chekotha anymore"", and the bonus track, ""Inside your heaven"". This wasn't a bad debut, i just thought it wasn't her best."
5,Gotta love,"I have loved Carrie Underwood since she was on A.I. This is a great first album. She keeps getting better, I would buy her follow-up album as well. I love how genuine she is in real life and you can hear it in her voice. It's a must have album. Pop it in the radio, turn it up and sing-along!"
4,Imagine my surprise,"I found American Idol 4 to be very disappointing and really didn't much care for Carrie. Imagine my surprise at this album. It is by far the best AI debut album so far. ""Jesus Take The Wheel"" should be a huge crossover hit for her....I expect it to top the Country, Christian and Adult Contempory charts. ""Before He Cheats"" is a solid Country winner. Both feature Carrie's amazingly powerful voice.The weakness of all the AI debut albums has been the over-abundance of sappy Pop tunes. Fortunately this cd has enough solid songs to overcome that handicap and make it a really good album. If you were a Carrie fan you're gonna love this album. If you weren't a fan, chances are, you will be now!"
5,Best CD Of The Year,"This cd is a must have. It is the best cd out there this year. You can listen to this from begining to end loving all the tracks. Picking a favorite is no easy task. Country and pop fans will all fall in love with this cd. She is by far one of the best vocalists out there and showcases that on her cd. This lady will be around for a long time to come like other idol winner kelly clarkson. As far as other idol winners (ruben & fantasia) she totally blows them away making them sound like william hung. The only other idol contestants that are worth listening to are: Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Kimberly Locke, Josh Gracin, Diana DeGarmo, Latoya London, Jennifer Hudson, Anthony Federov. Also Bo Bice is so over rated and his cd will be a big waste of time and money (I can sing better on a bad day). We Love You Carrie!!!! Yo Go Girl!!! Straight to #1 !!!"
1,I LOVE SOME HEARTS!!!!,"ITS SO BEAUTIUFULLL. MY FAVORITE SONG IS SOME HEARTS, it makes me dance so much in front of my friends. I look really dumb but I guess thats my problem, who cares? Anyway, but this its really awesome!!"
1,Not quite good enough,I'm sorry but Carrie Underwood just isn't good enough to sing full length albums. She'd be better suited for informal kareoke.
1,Carrie Underwood's debut,"I hope that she intends to sing better than this in her future releases, this is pathetic. Carrie Underwood, I liked you on American Idol, I liked you at the American Idol Season 4 Tour, and I loved your latest album, but this is awful."
5,A buch of peopel is going to hate me..,"I think she did a better job than Bo, even when Bo is given more time to work on his album (Bo has lesser press and stuff like that than Carrie. And also Bo's album is released about 1 month after Carrie's).Carrie Keep Up The Good Work!!!"
5,Carrie Rocks Country,I love this Album. I got it as a Christmas Present and it rocks.Wasted 9/10- It's great but her voice is a little to high.Don't Forget to Remember Me 7/10- It's O.K.Some Hearts 10/10- It's Awesome.Jesus Take The Wheel 10/10- It is one of the best on the album.The Night Before 9/10- It is pretty good.lessons Learned 10/10- I love the strongness in her voice.Before He Cheats 10/10- Definatly the best.starts With Goodbye 2/10- Forgetable.I Just Can't Live a Lie 3/10 -Another Forgetable song.We're Young and Beautiful 9/10- Great.That's Where It Is 2/10- ForgetableWhenever You Remember 10/10- A sound of passion in her voice.I Ain't In Checotah Anymore 10/10- Groovy Beat.Inside Your Heaven 10/10- A highlight On The Album.I reccomend this album to Country fans. Most songs are fantastic.
2,Just Not Good Enough,All she know's how to do is scream. I'm sure most people are just buying this because she's beautiful. Unless your a big Country fan and then you should like it. In my opinion I wish I didn't spend my money.
2,Four Decent Tracks,"There are 4 decent tracks: Jesus Take the Wheel, Before He Cheats, I Just Can't Live a Lie, and I Ain't in Checotah Anymore. Whenever You Remember, That's Where It Is and Inside Your Heaven are just dreadful songs, and Carrie ruined Wasted, Lesson Learned, and Some Hearts. The rest is just bland and forgettable. This is disturbing how many people pretend loving this album."
1,"Overly commercial, bland, mediocre 'country pop'!","Listening to this CD all the way through was a very painful exercise. Our military should have used this Carrie Underwood CD to 'flush out' insurgents, not heavy metal! The music is way too commercial and boring to be taken seriously by any music lover with good taste. It is pathetic and sad how gullible the masses have become in accepting the contrived, overproduced pop stars of today, who clearly exist and are 'manufactured' by the greedy record companies to make them maximum dollars and profits. We are witnessing runaway greed and commercialism that is turning 'artists' into 'product' like never before!"
1,Terrible trash,I can't believe that anybody would buy this buttered up trash. It sounds like songs that were recycled. She is contrived and she has no passion. In a long while we won't remember her name.
3,Good but lacking,"Great vocals on this album. My only criticism is the poor lyrics of the songs. Especially songs like ""Jesus Take the Wheel"" is cheesy and it's obviously geared towards those right-wing, Republican rednecks who love their evangelical Christian sap. I mean, if you wanna sing a spiritual song at least make it a good one. I hope Carrie puts some more thought into her next album."
1,Dislike every song,"There isn't a song I like on thsi album. Every song is passionless, contrived, boring, and just senseless, talentless, andd ridiculous. It's crazy how this girl even got a record deal, shameful if you ask me."
1,Not good.,"I really liked Carrie, and I love country music, but this cd is awful. Lame songs, and even though her voice is wonderful, it sounds the same on every song. I hate to say it, but I got bored with the cd after just a few listens."
1,Kelly Clarkson is amazingg!! Carrie just isn't...,"I'm not sure what happened to Idol since season 1 but it seemed to just have blown up, i'm sorry. Everything has been crappy since Kelly Clarkson. The trend is getting old. They can't just keep manufacturing no talents like Carrie. All she does is scream and yell with not one drop of passion in the least sense. I suggset she grow up and mature when singing a song like Wasted and see if she comes upon any newfound meaning. She sings it like an outsider who has no idea what she's singing about and needs voice enhancements. The rest of the album is just as shameful as this forsaken song. Poor lyrics."
1,SHE IS UGLY AND AWFUL,"I don't like her music at all and she doesn't have any talent. BO Bice is better! I never liked her american idol and I don't like her now. Get a life Carr,e you can't sing!"
1,Very dissapointed,"Wow, I was very dissapointed with this release. Carrie Underwood is from my hometown, Checotah OK, and I thought she was a good OKie and goign to release a decent cd. Wow was I wrong, I'm never watching AI again, she should've lost."
5,America's Pride,"Love the CD. Love the singer. Only more to come. This lovely and sweet young lady will be singing for years to come! My only wish is that she would make a rockin' CD. Her Heart rendition on American Idol blew me away!Oh yeah....one more thing. Would the bitter, mean-spirited and jealous chick who keeps writing a 1 star review for Carrie's CD, grow up and quit it? It's obvious it's the same person writing under different pseudonyms writing vicious things. One time was enough. It's easy to tell it's the same person by their style of writing, grammer, tone, and put-downs of Carrie while giving highest recommendations to Kelly Clarkson. They are both exceptional....just different. No need to be mean to one over and over just because you prefer Kelly over Carrie.Personal and vindictive criticisms are bad karma."
5,Some Hearts,I am very satisfied with this product. I really like the prices that are offered on CDNOW.
3,What are they doing in the recording control room??????,Am I the only one to noticed the abupt end to Inside Your Heaven in the middle of the fade out?????????? It's like the last 10 seconds of the song was chopped off.
3,I like it!,"I like the album, its okay, some songs like Jesus Take The Wheel, Some Hearts, I Just Can't Live a Lie are really good. Carrie keeps working with this zeal. You're awesome!"
2,Nothing Special,"I was greatly disappointed with this cd. I am a total country music fan and expected ""better"" songs. In simple terms, it's a boring cd. Not the kind of cd you can just pop in the player and let it play. Maybe the second one will be better, cause the talent she has, just the wrong songs being picked for her to sing."
1,Hillary Duff Goes Country !,"If you are under the age of 13, this is a great album. If you like real music by people who can actually ""write their own material,"" go buy a Martina McBride or Sugarland CD. This girl is selling a good amount of CD's, but if you gave ANYONE the amount of publicity she's had the past 6 months they would sell CD's as well (see Ashley Simpson). The song's on this album are very boring and slow."
5,Really great Country Rock,"I am for sure not a country girl, but some of these great women still know how to rock and roll!"
1,Just plain terrible!,"This album is horrible! I hate this music, every song sounds all the same to me. She needs to learn something about music and stop being afake lypsyncher. She's a very bad blonde."
1,Contrived. Not fun. Terrible production.,"I'm not giving a bad review just to bash Carrie. I kind of liked her on American Idol.But this album is such a let down. I feel like she recorded it for right wing America because that's what's in right now. I listened, and i won't be buying. I've persauaded several people not to buy it as well, becuase it is dissapointing, with horrible production, and obvious lyrics."
1,Just awful,"I don't get this. She is horrible, she is completely bonkers for releasing this trash. I can't even believe how horrible it is. The worst song is Lessons Learned and the Best Song is Inside Your Heaven because it's the last song."
1,Worst album of 2005,"She sounds awful on wasted, constricted on Dont forget.. and she sounds like a bublegum pop artist on some hearts. She is terrible all i had to do was listen to 3 songs and i knew. Give it up Underwood, you can't sing."
1,Sombody stole my review so i'm writing another one,"I'm sorry but i'm not going to stand by while somebody copies my review and twists my words. The truth about this album will stand. She sounds horrible. Every song is similar, making it hard to point out the differences between them. She sings dryly, with the same, high pitched voice. She lacks range and power. She seems to be like another one of those country singers who lurks into the shadows. Wasted is the best song on the album, of course, but nevertheless, the album is awful."
1,Carrie shouldn't have started this singing business!!,"I wish Carrie never went into singing. Her vocals on this album are screechy and terrible. Carrie, try working for PETA or something OTHER than singing!"
5,Carrie Underwood Album Some Hearts,"I purchased the cd album Some Hearts, and I love the album. All the songs in the cd are awesome. She will be around for a very long time.It was easy to purchase this item on Amazon. Just enter your info and click. I received my item in 2 days. I am very happy with your service."
2,Total Jewel Knockoff,"I am NOT a fan of American Idol, but I still wanted to hear Carrie Underwood's debut. So I listened to it...and it is a total knockoff of Jewel's This Way. Believe me, I know, because This Way is my favorite Jewel album and one of my favorite albums in general, after Tori Amos's Boys For Pele. In Jesus, Take The Wheel, her voice sings a little melody much like one in Jewel's song 'Till We Run Out Of Road, and the whole song sounds a lot like Standing Still. Carrie has a good voice, but her music is not original enough for my taste."
1,Horrible album!,I got this album for xmas from my aunt(who doesn't know me very well-obviously). I gave it a try but I just had to throw it out. It was the most horrible music i've heard in my life! All she does is scream and yell and the music overpowers her weak and shy voice.
2,Awful 70's Eco Tripe,"I can't belive that I was actually scared by the so-called ""monster"" in this film almost 20 years ago. A man in a rubber boogeyman suit - wooh!"
2,bear's a wimp- he should've done that to THEIR faces,"the title of this message sums it up. All 70's-80's horror flicks suck big time. This bear should have done that to THIER faces he is a bear after all. Grizzly bears(esp mutant ones) can pretty much win every fight and would maim the victim eventually. A human cutting up a bear with a knife and drowning it? c'mon, man! Watch ""Grizzly"" instead. Yeah it's early 70's feldercarbon, but it is very disturbing to the eye(s)."
5,I don't see the humor in this!,"I love this movie, wish it had extras though like deleted scenes, a documentary ect. Getting to the point now. My comments are directed to those reviewers who thought the sleeping bag scene was funny. What kind of sick twisted people are you to think that a kid being killed is in any way funny, you people need to see a shrink because there's something wrong with you!!!!!!"
4,Monster movie with a message,"Ok, I thought 'Prophecy' was a decent 70's horror flick. The ecological twist in the movie is interesting and hey, I enjoyed watching the beautiful landscape of Maine. Yes, Robert Foxworth puts in an 'over the top' performance but this IS supposed to be a horror movie. He did a great job. Talia Shire played the part of the weak wife to a tee; she is Adrian afterall(need I say more?).Overall, the movie had a creepy vibe. The indians were creepy, thanks to a solid performance by Armand Assante. The maine guys were a**holes. The overall talk of mutant genetics or 'freakism' combined nicely with the moody rain scenes. 'Prophecy' is definitely not a crap fest. In fact, Id easily put the movie one step above all the crap and call it 'GREAT'.'Prophecy' delivers the goods for a 'popcorn' horror movie that just MAY make you think a little. Hmmmmmmmm."
4,The Real Prophecy,"I remember going to the movie house to see this with my older brother when I was a kid. It scared the heck out of me then, I guess that is why I still like this movie today(2009). It is a unique story and a good made movie of its era. If you like older movies that are scary but not evil, you'll enjoy this."
4,Hilarious!,"A giant rubber bear with a melted face chases people around in the woods and hilarity ensues. The sleeping bag scene will make you laugh out loud. My favorite part of the movie occurs when the characters consult with ""Grandfather,"" a sage and wise old Indian shaman who resembles ""Ernie Douglas"" from the TV show ""My Three Sons."" The fact that ""Ernie"" keeps staring and grinning at the camera makes it that much more funny. When the characters are chased into a cabin, they begin sealing up doors and windows with a multitude of hammers and nails that seemingly appear out of thin air. And when things get really dicey, they flee into an extensive underground tunnel system located conveniently under the floorboards. Hey, it could happen!Amazing to believe that this mess was directed by John Frankenheimer.Enjoy!"
1,Politically correct horror movie?,"I like a good,solid, horror flick as much or better than the next fanboy.Unfortunately,Prophecy: The Monster Movie is a shining example of what occurs when you bring environmental political correctness into the mix.No mad scientists or supernatural creatures of the night.Instead we get a mercury poisoned grizzly bear that attacks a couple of scientists in the wilderness of the northeast.Stupid script and wooden acting make this the worst movie I have ever seen in all of my years upon the earth.(And I have seen some bad ones).I originally saw this in a theater and this was the first time I walked out and told the management I wanted a refund.I can't even imagine the zealots from Earth First sticking around and watching this dead fish rot on screen.I would be hard pressed to choose between having to watch this movie or have somebody use a hot soldering iron to burn their initials on my scrotum.To sum it up,yes,it sucks."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I have another CD by Glenn Harrold and I was disappointed in this one because it was too much like the first one I purchased. I was expecting some different imagery and basically got the same imagery that was in the first cd.However, I do find his voice soothing. I love the accent and it is a calming cd."
3,"Got me sleepy, but didn't fall asleep","I have never tried a sleep CD or anything like it before, but I've had trouble falling asleep my entire life so thought it was worth a try. I read a bunch of reviews of people who said this really worked for them. I tried this several nights in a row and never did I fall asleep during the audio. However, the breathing exercises and suggestions were good for helping me get relaxed. Each time I was able to fall asleep on my own without too much effort after the recording was over."
5,Brit the videos,"AWESOME that is the best word to describe the videos. It give you the full pepsi comercial, the viedos for slave, not a girl not yet a woman, and a few more, it also has a photo shoot with Britney. I love it."
5,Fantastic Illustrations,"This funny alphabet book about a pesky fly is a great story all by itself. However when you add Stephen Gammell's illustrations you get an instant classic in the area of children's books.Stephen Gammell's illustrations are pure artistic genius.Every child that I've read this story to have loved it.Apparently, it's only uptight, stick up their butt adults that don't like this book!!!"
4,Virtual Realities,This is an excellent book that tells how over the years Hollywood has become just as much a propaganda mouthpiece as the Chinese media. Hopefully it will awaken those Western supporters of Tibet from their fantasies and simplistic views of the Tibetan situation.
3,To bomb or not to bomb,I found it more informative than entertaining. I was a young boy at the time of WW 11 and gave the planning no thought. It is interesting to read about the agonizing decisions that had to be made.
5,Comic Artist Bible,"If you are endeavoring to be ANY kind of artist, I highly recommend this book. Stan ""the man"" Lee and John Buscema have made it the most simplified, yet exhaustive, step-by-step process for any artist to follow. Your artwork will benefit greatly; from the tools you need, to perspective, shadows and highlights, pencil techniques, inking techniques,... it's ALL here in one nicely illustrated and fun to read collection. I consider this an invaluable resource."
4,Liz and Todd share troubles,This was so funny! All the situations Todd got caught in were hilarious. Especially the bubbles at the Laundromat. And Liz kept leaving Todd for Bruce. I felt Kind of bad for Bruce.
5,Excellent Supplement for Medical Student Education,"I am a first year medical student, and bought this book on the advice of a second year. It has saved me during our cardio block. Our instructors don't teach EKGs very well, and this book explains them very clearly. It is also a pretty quick read, and works very well to help you learn and understand the material, not just memorize it. Buy this book!"
5,great EKG reference,this book is everything that the reviews and colleagues described. highly recommended to anyone that is in health care and would like an easy-to-read reference to keep in their library. i read it from cover to cover in a couple of days over coffee and actually enjoyed it!
1,"Buy Thaler's ""Only EKG Book You'll Ever Need"" instead","I'm a med student. I recently had an EKG quiz, and totally bombed it. Then I got Thaler's, and got almost every question right on the make-up exam. The problem with this book is that it doesn't go into enough detail to help you understand major important points of each EKG issue. For example, for left bundle branch block, it's important to know that you need to look at leads V5 and V6. Thaler tells you this; Dubin doesn't. It's simply not detailed enough to teach you what you need to know."
5,Excellent,This book is very clear and starts with the basics. It great for a new grad or an excellent review for nurse who wants to improve on reading EKG strips.
2,Did not particularly like this book,I preferred the EKG WORKOUT book by JANE HUFF. The Dubin book...I don't know...I felt like I wasted my money.
5,Great Resource,Excellent resource for study and education of interpetation of EKG interpetation and study guide for CCT exam. I highly recommend
5,makes learning easy,I was initially intimidated about the task of learning and interpreting 12 lead ekg's . Some friends/colleagues suggested this book as a fun and basic text for grasping the fundamentals. And that is exactly how I describe this book-it takes the complexity out of it and makes it a good learning experience.
1,Rapid Interpretation of EKGs,"I was never sent the product. I was informed that it was ""undeliverable"" although I gave you the correct address information.I was not given the opportunity to correspond before my order was cancelled, and no one responded to my e-mail.I was extremely disappointed in the services that were never provided."
3,"It's ok, but...","I got the book. It looked okay, but there are lots of memos and lines that bothered me a little bit."
5,Who couldn't love Wallace and Gromit?,"I saw the shorts, saw the Oscar-winning film in the theater--and now I've seen all of the Cracking Contraptions. Will look for more W&G; DVD titles. They're so much fun, and you can watch them on a date night or with kids. . .and DVD does a great job of telling their story.LOVE Wallace and Gromit."
2,still waiting for product,So far I have recieved everything I placed AFTER I placed this order...Wheres my stuff? I'd really like to hear this to see if I like it!
5,Time Marches On.,"I Like This CD Alot. It Is My Favorite Out Of All Tracy Lawrence's CDS. My Favorite Songs On This Album Are: The Title Track, ""If You Loved Me"", The Dance Song ""Stars All Over Texas"", And ""Is That A Tear"". This Is A Must Have For Any Tracy Fan."
5,Great Book!,Growing up this was my favorite book. Every kid who is interested in sports shpuld read it.
5,"THESE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY WORK!!!","These have been renamedOral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head (3 ct.)I am this customer's mother and am writing this review because I ordered this product. I am a coffee drinker and (unfortunately) a smoker and I have the stained teeth that come along with this territory. After reading that these toothbrush heads work just like a dentist's polishing head during a cleaning, I decided to try them. The package states that whitening takes 21 days, so I persevered for three weeks. Guess what, 21 days have elapsed and my teeth are no longer stained and are getting whiter and brighter with each passing day!!! I am so pleased that Oral-B developed this brush head and that I tried them. I even ordered 3 more packages. No more whitening trays, brush-on whiteners, white strips, etc. for my family or me!!!"
4,Great for what it is.,"I am a Corporate Trainer & am always in search of a poignant story and the like to add to a presentation. Although this book is well organized & quite extensive most every quote is directed to the Christian perspective. The book is one of the best that I have seen with this type of subject matter, but I will not be able to use it in my profession because of the religious content. I have in fact passed this book on to my sister whom is involved in Christian Retreats and is a speaker at those events. I also showed the book to my pastor and he will be ordering one shortly. Well organized, extensive on the subject matter and excellent stories abound inside. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for this type of materiel."
2,:-(,Obviously this was an item that I shouldn't have purchased online. The tools are fine for my 19 year old to keep in his trunk but the storage case has NO fasteners to close it. Sure the case is sturdy but without being able to lock closed it's inconvenient to carry and just not practical. I could have just bought tools and a toolbox but thought this was the better choice - oh well!
2,meandering frustrating book,"I really wanted to like this book but I couldnt get past the meandering inner dialouge of the main character, the strange sequences and the total lack of character development. It was basically one long poem about three days at Versailles at the start of the revolution. It lacks the crisp moving quality of Philippa Gregory's works and depended too much upon the reader's knowledge of French History.Not recommended."
1,This book was so bad...,"The storyline of this book was that of one women who was Marie Antoinette's personal reader talking about 3 days back in 1789, as the French Revolution nears. It seemed rather promising. However, I had three major problems with the book. First, it had no solid plotline. Secondly, it went off on tangents that really made no sense. And last of all, it was so unengaging. I didn't care about the characters or the book at all. It took me forever to finish it, all the while HOPING it would get better. It apparently won a award in it's native country of France, perhaps something was lost in translation to English?"
1,Gorham Melon bud 5-piece Stainless Flatware place setting,"The large fork was bent, but because I was going to a wedding the next weekend I could not return it for a replacement. You should really check to see if everything looks okay. I gave it to the bride and groom all wrapped up and hope they can exchange it at a local store."
2,Quality,The sound quality was not what I expect. It was just a minor improvement in sound quality from when it was originally recorded.
5,Really Wonderful,I am so glad that I took time to review other comments and selected this CD. A great selection of works by a really wonderful artist. Piaf's passion is felt each time that I listen ... and this is one CD that has become a listening staple. The music clarity is great and it is clear that the producers focused on listening quality.
3,She's losing her motivation (whatever it is),"This album is good, but her previous effort ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster"" was much better! There are some stand out tracks on this CD, namely ""Ride It"", ""Desire"", and ""Let Me Love You More"". It also features some big-band/jazz numbers at the opening and closing of the album that are a lot of fun.And in headlines lately, Geri will be rejoining the Spice Girls as they reunite for one last work tour in December of 2007. How exciting!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"It works in my car CD player just fine.Like the others, I'm pleasantly surprised by this record. It's has some pleasant jazzy songs, and her voice is still pleasant to listen to. Of course there's the campy dance numbers we love too."
2,"Ugh, this album makes me sad","I LOVE Geri, except this album! It's too serious!! All she does is sing about love! It should be renamed ""Stuck In A Piano Bar."" This CD is not Geri at all. It's not campy and/or fun. She needs to return to her Spice Girls/ ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster"" days. SIYWGF is her best album yet, this one is terrible. Out of 12 tracks, there are only 3 that seem like the old Geri. Those are 'Superstar', 'Ride It', and 'Don't Get Any Better'. I feel so bad for giving it a bad review. This album sounds NOTHIG like her first two albums. After this CD was released, she was once again dropped by her label, EMI."
4,Near Perfect PASSIONATE POP !,Ms Halliwell has successfully done it again.The spiciest of the girl power pack presents to the world a campy delightful musical romp bound to entertain fans. Geri continuously produces a familiar sound for her fans to enjoy. This is clearly why she succeeds on the charts while her counterparts fail.She gives her target audience what they want to hear. Catchy tarty pop!Truly a sinful addiction. Geri does not take herself seriously as a vocalist while she enjoys her time in the spotlight and that is exactly why the CD is fun and pleasant. Geri is a modern day incarnation of Madonna before she seen any rays of light.
1,Tabloid,"Full of hatred as the first one, just the sources of this last one tell us everything about how the writer of that biography has written it : using tabloids and people magazines....That's all, so no doubt about the poor accuracy of the content.Better buy other books on Mr Gibson."
3,A cheaper alternative,"I don't actually own this product and there is no information as to the power supply. In these energy conscious days, it is something that all of us should take seriously.It looks to be battery operated. But more detailed information should be given.For those who have deeper environmental concerns and a shallower pocket, there is a cheaper alternative, home construction. http://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-DVD-Rewinder.Finally, it is worth mentioning that although double sided dvds are somewhat rare these days, these disks do not have to be rewound, having watched one side, one simply flips the disk to watch the other."
3,Ok,This is an ok book. Tells a lot about his life and what he accomplished with Duke and the Pistons
2,Pretty but easily broken!,"I was so excited to get these earrings. I ordered them Sunday and they arrived Wednesday, so I was impressed with the speedy delivery. However, when I opened up the package, the back post that goes into the ear was badly bent. I went to fix one of them (not using a lot of pressure or force at all) and the whole inside part of the rose came completely off and would not go back in. Thinking I would try to superglue it back together I turn to the next earring. I pick it up, and the middle pearl falls off!!! I was so disappointed. I tried bending and supergluing last night with not much luck. They are very pretty and I hope I can get them fixed. They look exactly like the picture, just don't breathe on them or they will fall apart!!!"
4,"Good book, bad puctuation.",I just completed a 2 week tour of England/Scotland and decided I needed to know more about British history. The book was excellent for this purpose. The only complaint was the puctuation was not always correct which caused me to have to reread some areas to understand what the author was saying.
4,Miss Evers' Boys review,The movie was an assignment for school. I still found it very interesting and well done. It's a great example of the importance of laws governing the use of human subjects in research. Good information on an ugly piece of US history. Hopefully the lessons reach further than dealings in our own country.
5,Very Good,This movie arrived in good time and it is in excellent condition. I highly recommend this seller. Thanks!
4,For Those Who Love The Eighties,"Three O'Clock High is one of those forgotten 80's movies that you just can't find anywhere. And yet, if my dad had his say, it would be held up as a classic.Jerry is no ordinary kid. He's hypoglycemic. He has a best female friend who believes in benevolent spirit guides named Toby. He dries his clothes by sticking them in the microwave. And now he's about to earn himself a reputation as the boy who was challenged to an after school fight by the one, the only Buddy Revell.The whole school has gotten a whiff of blood, and it's worked them up into a frenzy.Will Jerry win? Will he be pummeled to a pulp? I guess you'll just have to watch the movie to find out.There's something about this movie that's a lot like Ferris Bueller, only with a different plot.* - Painfully bad** - Barely watchable*** - Could go either way**** - Recommended***** - One of my favorites"
4,Underated 80's Classic finally comes to DVD,"I've waited a long time for this movie to be released on DVD. It languished way too long in the overpriced retail rental VHS format. Though the DVD is bear bones; no extra scenes, no commentary, not even the obligatory paper insert with the scene list(!?); it's still a must have for any fan of 80's teen movies.Casey Siemaszko is excellent! The ""Book Report"" scene and the song ""Something to Remember Me By"" both help make up for the DVD's lack of extras. The quirky camera zooms & angles, plus quotes like ""Your face looks like non-fat milk."" are the cherry on top.My other favorite thing about the film is that I get to remember what real 80's fashion and hair looked like from all the background student extras. Not some Hollywood stylist's interpertation. Gawd... did we really wear all those horrid colors with those fluffy poodle cuts??? Sheesh!"
4,drapery rings,"was perfect for my curtains on a tension rod in bathroom, curtains hand well and are easy to open and close, would order again when needed"
2,Product is good when it works,"Have a Pro grade gun dispenser, but the threads on top of the bottle were either threaded wrong or something. Could not get bottle to seat properly on gun. Other bottles worked ok,..but 2 out of 3 of these wouldnt screw on properly.Very expensive per bottle compared to disposable units from Big box stores."
5,"Just like the disposables, but....","You definitely get more product for your money, but cleanup is key. If you don't clean your gun well, you are better off with disposable cans."
5,The best MacBeth mystery of the series.,"I have enjoyed all of the Hamish MacBeth novels, but this one is my favorite. First, Hamish has to deal with the ending of his long relationship with Priscilla and then he has to deal with the loss of another long time friend. Hamish ends up on a vacation that is anything but a vacation. Beaton does an excellent job of creating great suspects and weaves together a great mystery. Recommended reading for anyone that loves mystery novels."
5,master/slave,"Hot! A Page-Turner! Covers all kinds of styles, flavors, desires and kinks of Dominance and submission. The only thing hotter is if you are living the life style! For those curious, not sure, sitting on the fence.....this will be the deal breaker. Cause you either want more of it, want to join some club or group...... or too faint-hearted, not your cup of tea - and now you are sure."
3,Not enough good stories to make it worth the money,"Don't waste your time. The four good stories-at an average of three pages each-are not worth the money for this book. If you really feel like you HAVE to have it, buy a used copy, or find one to trade with someone!"
1,Very Poor Quality Book,I will be sending this book back as it is just a photo copy of a book! The photographs are of very poor photocopy quality and hardly visible. I feel the is desceptive advertising as the book was $29.00. I hope Amazon is more careful in how it advertizes books. I feel it should state when a book is a photocopy. Be warned.
4,Great BEGINNERS book,I really want to emphasise the title. Very basic but equally effective and the projects grow quickly. After you master these I would suggest the A-Z of Crewel Emroidery from Country Bumpkin - more projects and techniques but you'll have the basics already! Definitely worth the price of the book to get you started.
2,"Phyllis Diller's Version of ""A Christmas Carol""","The only people I'd recommend this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" to are hardcore collectors of Phyllis Diller memorabilia and/or versions of ""A Christmas Carol."" This is one of the least impressive, animated versions I've seen."
1,It won't install,I never had a chance to use the Dymo LabelWriter DUO becuase it would not install and run with MAC OSX 10.4.4 or 10.4.5. Help desk personnel were very polite and professional but could not figure out how to get the LabelWriter to install.
2,Middling to Sometimes Awful,"I try to avoid making general statements about the quality of acting in gay films, as it's usually somewhat sub-par, or should I say sometimes sub-par acting is okay if everything else falls together and then you have a decent film.Not here.Every scene feels like a bad high school play. I can't believe all these semi-stars showed up for this terrible mess. I feel especially bad for Michelle Nichols, clearly out of everyone's acting league here. Hers is the only decent acting during the entirety of this film. And the only few moments when you feel some sincerity and, perhaps, some meaning in all the messiness here.There are a couple cute guys, and some nice costumes, and lots of nods to comic books. This is a rental, purely. I doubt you'll want to see it more than once."
4,Loud but good,"I bought this laptop in Apr, 2003 for College. It is great. I can do pretty much everything a college student and more can do.The only thing i dont like about this laptop, well there are two, are first, the fan, and second the weight.The fan is loud and it runs non-stop. Even with the fan running constantly the computer is still quite hot. The weight is the other factor for me. It weights close to 8LBS! So it is not really a laptop, just a cool thin desktop.By the way, dont wear shorts and have this laptop on your lap. You will be asking for first degree burns hahahah.But not to dis this laptop too much, since i am typing from it right now, it is a good laptop/desktop for a college student."
1,awful experience with sony,I'd avoid this machine. The series has chronic cooling fan problems. Customer service is great: if you don't mind spending 12 HOURS on the phone before getting authorization to send them the computer for repair. Mine came back with a defective fan. The time wasted wasn't worth the price of the computer.
2,Do NOT waste your money on this junk!,"Now, I am on to my 2nd replacement FRV25, after the first 2 broke down. Pointing device was broken on the first one, the screen was broken was on the second one (since these were within the first 14 days, I got replacements from BestBuy). On this third one, the screen is slightly tilted and one of the keys popped out, so I need to take it back to BestBuy for repair.If you are looking for an advice and recommendation (from a software professional), I am warning you about this computer. Do NOT waste your money on this computer.Besides its extremely poor quality, original CD's don't come with the computer. So, if you want to have the original CD's, you need to buy them from SONY separetely."
1,Come on....,"Well, please only buy cameras that you can check out in person first. I thought I was getting a deal, and this camera is a lemon. The reviews on this site made the camera sound decent enough, but now I feel I just blew eighty bucks. My main complaint is that it's really hard to get a decent looking picture with this camera. Most pictures I take end up looking kind of green. I'm really missing my old camera that I lost, I thought that just because this camera was 8mp it would be quality. Also the face recognition is not something you would recognize. Its one saving grace is that it takes decent movies.Oh ya, one really really annoying thing. My camera has a tendency to give a ""depleted battery"" message, as soon as I put NEW batteries in. It automatically shuts down. I'm not sure what's going on, I have to start the camera in a special play only mode to get it to work. Anyway, just don't buy cheap electronics without testing them out first."
4,Revision 2,I Reviewed This Items When First Received Them Don't Know What Happend To ItI Found Items Items To Be Very Good Condition Once Again Thank EverybodyThank You
3,Terror Train,"Fun whodunit but we all know from the beginning who is doing it? Jaime Lee Curtis is beautiful as usual, I like the Marx Bros touch and the Steam Train."
4,Great for the whole family,One family member has Guitar Hero for PS2 and it's great fun. So this will be a great Christmas gift for other family members!!
4,good but hard,this game is a great party game but i would not recommend it for younger kids as they will get frustated because on the harder levels it takes great finger dexterity
1,"Rah Rah, sssss Boom Bah","Although this publication claims to reveal the ""secrets"" of LinksLS, it is nothing more than a pep talk. Its illustrations are very difficult to see, there is a lot more to putting and other subleties to the game than the authors bothered to mention. The book is extremely overhyped.The authors indicate they are doing one a big favor by ""revealing"" the ""secret"" swing meters. This information is readily available on the web, along with tips on putting, loft, wind and other factors that are much more detailed and useful to the online golfer.In summary, my psychiatrist might recommend it to improve my moral, but it is not going to improve my golf game. Do not waste your hard-earned bucks. Search the web for LinkLS and get much more useful information on game play."
1,Mikasa cup and saucer,"Not packed well at all and broken into pieces. Disappointed but they issued credit for item, not shipping"
5,Kids Big Book of Games,Wonderful collection of games. My children (age 6 and 8) have thoroughly enjoyed this. Well thought out and great for the car too.
1,Candy cigarrets,"Very bad buy on my side. first of all i had misstaken these for the candy bubble gum cigarrets. When i got my package i was quite happy with the shipping time, 3 days but when i opened the package it was just the candybox inside of an amazon box. The candy box was not sealed and it was all dusty on the outside, and when you opened it the ciggarete individual boxes were all dusty. I opened one of the individual cases and there were like 5 or 6. I opened another box and there was 5. I tried one of the candy sticks and it tasted horrible! not a good buy at all. WARNING THESE ARE JUST STICKS OF CHALK PRETTY MUCH, DO NOT MISTAKE FOR BUBBLE GUM CIGS."
2,Not worth the money,This product didn't do anything. I purchased it to work on light sunspots and used it religously twice a day for 5 weeks and no change. I went with DDF gel and light night and day. Don't waste your dollars.
5,Must have for Darius fans,There are lots of hidden gems on this CD.If you listen really closely you can start to hear the prelude to his going country.
5,Fun Game,This game is great for visual spatial awareness and for strategizing. This is fun for adults as well as children.
1,too hard,"I wish I knew about these reviews before I bought this game. SImply put, its too hard. Ilove E.T., but this game is not worth it but another one."
5,The Gufs are awesome!,"Words are unable to describe this band. The best that I can come up with are awesome, passionate, unbelievable, and inspiring. I saw the band live twice and the are incredible. All of their albums are worth their weight in gold!"
5,The Gufs make great music!,"The Gufs, (from my hometown, yeah yeah Milwaukee!) are a great alternative band. They are one of my favorite groups, and their music is really beautiful and inspiring. I am listening to this CD right now, and some songs are mellow and relaxing like Listen to the Trees, while others you can really rock out to like Smile and Crash Into Me. This is a great CD, i suggest you buy it!"
5,Eric Braun the Legend!!,"No matter how you review this Cd you have to say that Eric was and will always be a pioneer of guitar. Maybe some of the songs here are different than what Butterfly fans are used to but one thing is for sure, its Eric back at the axe. Man give this guy credit, he came into music when people weren't even taking the chances that he took on guitar. He set a alot of standards for players coming up and it is such a shame that he is already gone from us. Wherever your at Eric I know you are playing your a-- off, God Bless you for your contributions to Rock N Roll."
1,Egads!,"I bought a cutout version of this at a record collector's show, just to complete the collection.The 2 dollars I paid for it was about a dollar and ninety nine cents too much!There ARE one or two songs on this album that come dangerously close to being good.But, man oh man, the rest? Hold your nose and open all the windows; Something bad is in the air, and the dog didn't do it this time.There is one outstandingly bad track on this LP called 'Searchin' Circles', which actually makes the album worth owning. The vocals on it take on this 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' quality, making the song unintentionally hillarious to listen to. It's straight out of Doctor Demento's 'Audio Torture Vault.' In fact, if I ever hosted a 'Bad Music' program, 'Searchin Circles' would absolutely be the theme.Hope this helps!"
1,Should be melted and never released again.,"Erik Braunn and Doug Ingle always had fights about who was the most important member in the band. With Ingle gone, this album shows you who was right. Ingle was gone by the time of this release and Braunn and the rest of the band was just trying to benefit from the name. This is just a waste of money. By the way, Sun And Steel was just as bad."
5,Simply beautiful!!,"What a voice Luis has!! Unsurpassable! Both, his early performances and later ones, are simply beautiful. The music is nice, too, with the Latin beat and melody I love. Luis Miguel is so passionate, even as a boy. . .I highly recommend this CD."
2,MISLED,"This is not Josh Groban. To quote the jacket,""Artist name for song reference only."" Maybe I mised this when ordering, but it was a disappointment. The overall recording is fair to good."
3,skinless sardines,The skinless sardines are like overcooked fish but not much fishy odor. The liquid is somewhat tasty.
1,Pricing increased dramatically: up over 51%,I've been receiving these via Subscribe and Save for several years. The price just went from $13.07 to $19.75. Bye Bye.
5,Great sardines!,"I will definitely order these again. Yes, they are on the dry side, but they are perfect for making seafood salad. Very nutritious and low in sodium, which is rare. I also love that they are skinless, boneless, and only 120 calories per can. I eat them at least once a week."
2,I was disappointed in this book!!,"My two year old is obsessed with the story of the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf. I bought this book hoping to be able to read the story to him. I was suprised when I got it. I give the book an ""A"" for creativity, but it is not the story of the Three Pigs. I find the book weird and impossible to read to a two year old. He likes the pictures on the first few pages and then we're done with the book. I want to return it!!!"
5,Bought Used,In good shape and my grandson loves the pigs and the great pictures in the book. I also have a copy of this in my classroom.
2,24 Preschool Students Can't Be Wrong,"I read books to children for a living and love to do so. I road test many books and judge a book by the response I get from my students. Four and five year olds love the Three Little Pigs, Pig, Pigger, Piggest, The Fourth Little Pig, and The Three LIttle Wolves. They don't take to this one. It confuses them and the response is a group blank stare and telepathic ""huh?"" I have tried it a few times and am now going to donate it."
2,Baroque Childrens Literature,"I have to join the naysayers here. The illustrations are beautiful, but my 4 year old daughter and I were left exchanging blank looks as the story dissolved into an incoherent montage."
2,The Three Pigs/ Wiesner,Because it was a caldecot award winner I thought how can I go wrong. Was disapointed. I just couldn't appreciate the cut and paste feel of this traditional story gone mad. Not worth the discounted price.
1,My 7 year old hated this book,"My 7 year old did not like this book. He thought the story line was awful, and not appealing to kids. He did not like the illustrations. And he did not understand the plot of the story. This book was one of the worst books we have read. Save your money."
4,"A winner from ""the theater of the absurd""","Perhaps this ""warped"" tale of The Three Little Pigs is meant for BOTH children AND adults. Fans of ""The Fractured Fairy Tales"" segment of the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" series, as well as readers of ""The Stinky Cheese Man and other Tales"", will get a kick out of these revisionist telling of the fairy tale standard. Short on text, the book has engaging artwork and an off-the-wall sense of humor that would appeal to the kid in all of us."
2,"Meant for adults, not children!","I bought this book assuming that its beautiful and unusual illustrations would reflect a satisfying storyline. (Yes, I was also duped by the Caldecott sticker on the front.)I appreciate the satire, and the illustrations are certainly sharp; however, the story line is practically impossible to follow for preschool age children. For those of us who enjoy reading aloud to our children, this is a terrible and disappointing choice.I agree 100 percent with some of the other reviewers--this book is meant for adults, not children. (PS, I also bought Knuffle Bunny by Mo Willems--a much better choice for the preschool set)."
5,keyboard for mac,"thank you! the quickest shipping ever recieved in all my years of online ordering! wow! love the keyboard, its the most affordable one I have found for a mac. It works great and it does the job intended. excellent!"
4,Decent Keyboard,"It's the most readily available third party apple keyboard on the market as far as I can tell. The slimline design is okay and overall it has a semi-sturdy feel. My apple brand keyboards kept dying on me, so lets hope this one handles the wear and tear."
4,An upbeat cd Oro Solido style!,"I was very surprised when I listened to this album. I did not expect it to be so full of energy and charisma. Raul Acosta once again has risen to the occasion and is showing the world that his style of ""mambo merengue"" is real and here to stay. Honestly, I am not fan of ""Oro Solido"" and seldomly listen to their music but I will give credit when credit is due. This merengue is up beat, fast paced with crazy lyrics which makes dancing this kind a merengue a lot of fun. Also included is a bachata and a cumbia which are debuts for Oro Solido in each genre respectively and are very well done. This is dancer's album from start to finish. Therefore, if you like fast paced, mambo merengue Oro Solido style you will love this album. Bueno ponte a bailar hasta las quince mama..."
2,The real enemy in this game is Boredom!,Being an X-man fan i rushed out to buy this and was sorely disapointed. All the way home i was itching to be Rouge but after a few minutes of her strutting as she walk drove me crazy! So a change of charactor - good old wolverine you'll help surely? No his ape like image was too much! Storm and Cyclops rescue the game slightly. The levels are so slimular its a crime and the bosses no harder than each other. Even the final battle was a walk in the park! What had the potental to be a great game is let down by its shortness (i compleated it in hours and i'm not the best gamer in the world!) and its simplisity. I hate to say it but a big let down!
2,Beware the shipping costs,"Buyer beware. I ordered this cheese, not quite realizing how small 1 pound of cheese is and how big a box they would use to ship it, and practically paid more for the shipping than I did for the cheese."
3,Complicated with little flow,"When we went to see both Ridley Pearson and Dave Barry when they came to talk about their co-authored book Peter and the Starcatchers, we picked up a signed copy of this book. We knew little about Pearson except for what was said at the event, but we hoped for a lot since he was a local author. Well, I hate to say it but I was little impressed with this choppy and complicated book. There were times when the reader was expected to pick up on hints that led to resolutions in the book, yet I didn't pick up on them. The book was not a complete waste of time. I was able to follow the computer lingo which seemed a little out dated."
3,Bye Bye Boldt,"This will be the last Lou Boldt book I buy. It might also be the last Ridley Pearson book I buy. Tea-drinking, jazz-playing, sensitive but competent Lou has finally become an utter bore. This time out, the story never quite takes off, and it never really pays off. (If you don't count the revelation the Boldt's son, Miles - MILES! - is actually a child prodigy, a little Mozart.) Mainly we trudge along, knee-deep in Lou and Liz's struggle with her past infidelity. Boldt doesn't actually DO anything but wrestle with his emotions. Even LaMoia fails to light things up, seemingly just along for the ride. I almost didn't read the last 20 pages!Reader beware...."
1,This ripped out my ends!!!,"I got this flat iron because I was so amazed by the ""smoothness"" of the glass. The actual iron itself isn't too bad, and it straightened my hair really well, which is super hard to do, being that my hair is incredibly thick, even after I blowdry it. HOWEVER, the ends of my hair got all caught up where the glass ends and heat protection material begins. It made this ripping noise, and there was my hair on the ""smooth"" glass!!! This product would have been WAY better if they had made the plates smooth on the ends. Now I have shredded hair, and have to go to the salon to get all the split ends trimmed! Thanks Conair!!"
4,Nimrod alone,I'm buying this recording today because of the Nimrod track. Just heard it on the radio and this purchase will be worthwhile if all the rest of the music is junk. What a way to buy a CD--for one track.
2,Awful Experience,"I guess I'm the only one that had a terrible time with this grip. First the holes did not match up at all for the grip pin. I had to file excess plastic off the back of the holder for 30 minutes and hammer-tap it into place. It sounds like it didn't line up for anyone. Not sure how that got 5 stars for obvious design flaws. Second, the grip pin is longer than the frame, because it fits through the original grips which go over the frame. This means the pin is sticking out into the rubber grips and keeping them from being flush. The end result was a long gap down the rear of the handgun in which you could see the main spring housing. What a joke! These are going right back in box, and back to Amazon..."
3,color,It's a color wheel with zero help. I really hoped there would be a bit more info on how to use. If you really know what yu are doing then this is perfect for you.
3,For dreamers everywhere,"A Siamese cat who would rather be a chihuahua?! Well, heck, I'm a cat person who thinks chihuahuas are overgrown rats, but I could not help but smile when I saw this book! Ms. Schachner made a delightfullly odd story full of, may I be honest, a moron's view of old Mexican bandit culture. And yet so many other things have done the same, and the resulting story is hilarious, imaginative, and a rush to read and the eccentric and creative little kitten grabs your attention and heart as he imagines himself as much more than a boring old Siamese kitten but the great swordsman El Skippitto, defender of the oppressed everywhere! Skippyjon is a true little boy despite the fact that he is a cat and does not let the little details of reality get in his way. His mother clearly adores him and one cannot blame her. Simply adorable!"
5,Skippyjon Jones,Great book for the child and parent who is looking for LOL's! The parent or reader may want to practice first since it's funnier when you know what to emphasize and can be busy laughing instead of concentrating on the reading.
3,Reader/Author reads WAY to fast.,"Even with the words right in front of us, we had a hard time following the story line because the reader on the cd says the words so fast. The story or plot was cute, but I can see how a Mexican American might be offended. The fact that small children can't really understand the story the first few times through makes me want to return it. I will have to read it several times to my kids in a slower manner so they understand it well before putting the cd in again. I would not purchase this again."
1,Warning - Worst Book Ever!!!!,"My 5 y.o. daughter insisted on buying this book at her school book fair. The librarian said it was a great book and other parents at the book fair remarked on what a great book it was also. However, when I read it to my 5 y.o. and 8 y.o. they both hated it - they did not get it. They thought the story was hard to follow and that Skippito was too weird. They did not understand the rhyming (if thats what you want to call it?)and both complained it lacked the telling of a story - plot. Neither child wants to read it again.I agree with all of the above and would like to add some complaints of my own. This book is highly offensive to me as a Mexican-American. It is demeaning and degrading in respect to the Spanish language and hispanic culture. Skippito is not a hero or a role model but a bad caricature of the Taco Bell dog.I feel bad that I exposed my children to this book that is not well written or funny. And I plan to take it back as a matter of principal."
1,Plainly uninteligent!,"I cannot see what benefit children can obtain from learning how to make fun of people based on national and ethnic origin . Just because it is called a children's story does not make it so ! Terrible ! Insensitive and bigoted!Should we expect more stories of the character Skippyjon visiting Asia and Africa and making ""innocent fun"" of the peoples there?"
1,Appalling and offensive,"I bought this book for a class on children's literature I was taking, figuring I'd just give it to my niece when I was done. There's no way I'd give this book to her now that I've read it, though. It's full of fake ""Spanish"", stereotypes, and is just a terrible example to give kids. They might find it funny, but they are also learning that sterotypes are okay and funny. I'm usually pretty ""whatever goes"" but this one was too much for me."
3,Just not that interesting,"I wasn't interested in this book, neither were my nieces (5 and 2.5) at all.The story didn't grab any of us at all.Additionally, I don't think mock-Spanish is particularly funny. I don't think it's overly racist, not in this book, I just don't think it's *funny*.I get that other people like it a lot, I just... don't. This is one I suggest you read before you buy."
5,I LOVE SkippyJon!,"I got this book originally from my book of the month club when my kids were little, it became an instant hit. We read that book over and over and my kids would always laugh at my spanish accent, even though they had heard it 100 times. SkippyJon is a fun, lighthearted book with lots of adventures and a momma who loves him enough to discipline him. I have bought this book for all of my friends with small children and reccommend it as a great read aloud, even for older kids. We got the one with the CD and printed some coloring sheets off the internet, and all 3 of my kids then (6, 8, 10) enjoyed it!"
2,Poor Filming of A Seminar,"Hanshi Minobu MIKI did not authorize the production of this video and receives none of it's profits.The filming cuts in and out and wobbles around. Just when Hanshi MIKI is about to make an important point, the filming stops and resumes just as he finishes, and it cuts off an important demonstration of technique. It's very frustrating to watch.Also the poor quality of the video equipment shows."
4,Very well written and interesting,Mr. Carrillo has a very good use of the English language and words. He tells his stories with a lot of word pictures and makes it very interesting.
4,Good knife,"I do like this knife and feel its a great 1st knife for a boy, when he is ready. I will also express my displeasure of this being made in China. Buck had always been an American made company, oh well."
1,How I got gipped,"I've been along time fan of this product, until they recently changed their formula. Now, every bottle that I buy is like water! You can't even blow bubbles with it! So I contacted California Baby, asking for a reason. Someone named ""Sue"" responded, and said that she would send me postage paid envelope to return the bottles I had. It's been a month now, and no envelope has arrived. Now when I email ""Sue"" about it, she either ignores me, or places the blame on another department in the company. So I'm still without bubbles, and it looks like CA Baby still has my money. I feel gipped!"
1,GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT...,"THIS IS A VERY DISAPPOINTING COMPILATION. THE INFORMATION GIVEN IS EITHER AN ADVERTISMENT TO BUY OTHER DESIGNERS' IDEAS, OR IS ALREADY READILY AVAILABLE FOR FREE ON THE INTERNET. MOST OFFENSIVE ARE THE TERRIBLE RENDERINGS; FIRSTLY, BECAUSE THEY ARE IN LIGHT GREY, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DISCERN ANY DETAILS, AND SECONDLY, MANY OF THEM ARE NOT EVEN CORRECTLY DRAWN TO PERSPECTIVE! ANYONE CONSIDERING USING THESE RECOMMENDED DESIGNERS SHOULD HAVE THEIR HEADS - AND EYES - CAREFULLY EXAMINED."
3,BECKY DEL PARAMO E HIJA,"Although it's not a materpiece, a bit slow in some parts, every Almodovar film is always a gift for the senses, and Tacones Lejanos ""High Heels"" is not the exception. Exceptional acting performances by Victoria Abril and Marisa Paredes, amazing cinematography, marvelous songs by Luz Casal (""Un año de Amor"" and the heartbreaking ""Piensa En Mi""), funny impersonators secenes (Miguel Bose aka Letal), and a must-seen for all the fans of the House Of Chanel with big exposure of clothes, jewelry, bags, glasses (eraly 90s collections). At last, i recommend this film for just having a big time with this funny Almodovar."
4,Keeping Busy,"I think this was a great accessory to my Prima Papa. A toy my daughter could not throw on the floor for me to pick up, she really enjoyed playing with the phone. Just remember to take it off before feeding your baby or you will have something else to clean."
2,Very shallow side-scrolling game,"Clearly I'm in the minority with my opinion, but I simply don't see the appeal of this game. Encountering enemies becomes repetitive very fast and they quickly become a nuisance more than any kind of real challenge. Fighting is overly simplistic and each level offers little in the way of variety or challenges. The music is weak; hardly SNES caliber at all. On the plus side, Spiderman is animated very, very well, but the backgrounds are dark and lifeless. You won't see much background activity or details.Simply put, it's a shallow game. There are better side-scrollers out there. Try a Mario game, Wario Land 4, or (my personal favorite) Castlevania: Circle of the Moon."
5,The Best GBA game so far,"I bought this game yesterday and I love it! It uses the GBA's advanced graphics capabilities way better than other side scrollers like Castlevania. The gameplay is fairly realistic and fast-moving with lots of action. Like the Spiderman games for the GBC, the levels are vast and colorful, and in ""Mysterio's Menace"" they are also quite realistic as well. There are also 3 difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, and Superhero. I started out on easy and went through the first few stages fairly easily, and defeating Hammerhead, Electro, and Rhino(the bosses) was fairly easy. On normal, the levels aren't too hard, but the bosses are really hard to defeat. Neat powerups, like special armor and web cartridges keep the game interesting. Overall, I strongly recommend this game, especially if you haven't been impressed by the GBA's rather weak showing up to now in the game department."
4,Decent Game... If you are a spiderman fan!,"I got this game for my birthday. It is pretty decent. You play as spiderman and beat up guys using your ultra strength. There are lots of cool spidey moves and bad guys. The bad thing is that it is a little short, only 7 levels. And the last levels are a little frusterating. But besides that the sound is almost C-d quality, the graphics are neat and clear, and its a load of fun for Spidey fans."
3,Poor service to a great writer,"Of course the quality of the writing is as brilliant as ever. However, in order to squeeze the twenty plus set of novels into a compact form the publishers have resorted to quite small print and, even more off-putting, they have used very light gsm weight paper which not only feels insubstantial but seems to make pages stick so that one is often turning over two pages not one. This is particularly annoying since I find that I lose immersion in the narrative checking page numbers and prising the pages apart. I would have been happy to pay another $50 or more for a higher quality presentation."
1,great set spoiled,"The Aubrey-Maturin novels take you back to another time - you become thoroughly immersed in the details and the language of O'Brian's great stories. I have collected quite a few of the books and thought I would like to get the whole set. This edition is nicely presented on good paper, but I quickly found that I could not enjoy the books because I kept coming across passages that didn't make sense to me. Eventually I checked with one of the existing books I have and found that this edition contains numerous errors - bad punctuation, words missing etc - which spoil the enjoyment. I have given the set away and returned to collecting the books one at a time."
5,Patrick O'Brian - Master & Artist,"This collection of books is a stunning tour de force. Reminiscent of Jane Austen for it's ascerbic wit; with more action than Hornblower. On reading the collection one becomes part of the crew: immersion is total. O'Brian's prose is tight; the dialogue disarmingly mundane and domestic (at times), but the action is immediate and the political intrigue is compelling. A brilliant body of work."
3,you get what you pay for,"I agree that this is a great way to get your hands on the entire set of books for a very reasonable price. However, the quality of these volumes is a little suspect. The covers of these ""hardback"" books are only slightly more stiff than the softcover versions. I'm not sure if I would have purchased these books if I would have had a chance to touch them before hand. Caveat emptor!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am not talking about the quality of the movies, but of the quality of the dvd release. It's horrible. The first movie is not possible to watch - it's just one big smear. The Triad Affairs is slightly better. Also no extras, as promised on the cover. Just don't waste your money on it, there are better releases with Tony Leung and Andy Lau somewhere! I was so dissapointed!!!"
5,PLEASING SOUNDS,I waited to place an online review until I had use these speakers for a while. With my pleasure I am telling you that this speaker system rivals the much higher price ranged speaker systems. They are very pleasing to the ear with much room for sound ajustment on the remote control with the only draw back with the remote that it's not wireless. The only other draw back is the rear speaker wire lengths. Other than that your sure to get pleasing sounds from this system. By the way I upgrade to these after my Z560 Logitech System lost its Subwoofer.These are much better sounding.
3,RSVP Top-Dot Red Temper,"Pros : Perfect fit for 2"" espresso machine. Works.Cons : NoneOther : Received broken item. (red-dot plastic part). Don't bother to replace.AVOID CentralChef"
4,As described,"Product is fine, just as described. However, if you were looking for a tamper to fit the Delonghi EC155, do not listen to the other reviewers here that say this fits correctly. IT IS TOO SMALL by about 2 mm, which makes it useless.So the product is well made and great if it fits your application, but if you are buying to use with the EC155, it is absolutely not correct! I ordered this one specifically because other reviewers said it was correct and I can tell you it is positively not!"
2,OH MY! 3mm SHY,"Waited so long to order this, hoping that it would be the right size. It is not 49mm but 46mm.Nice to look at and feels good but will have to return. So sad."
1,Not 49mm!,The tamper measures 46mm so it is completely useless for tamping the 49mm basket on my Breville. It's going back.
4,"cheap, fancy balls!","I bought this product so I could wear the beads on my industrial. Unfortunately, I screwed one on too tight, and it split in half. While that was sad, I was very impressed with how fast this item shipped. If you do purchase this, remember to take care when putting the jewelry on- you don't want to split your balls!"
3,Entertainment,This book made it's way around my camp while in Iraq. Everyone I know got a fun laugh out of the seriousness that isn't really there.
2,"A really, really, light read","A fun read, but you'll finish it in under an hour, and it doesn't really lend itself to a re-read. Even the pictures are mere glance at them once icons."
4,Humorous and thorough,"I highly recommend this book for educated people who nevertheless know nothing about robots aside from what they've seen in movies and on TV. The book rarely goes into technical detail, but does leave the reader with a solid understanding of where robotics is, and where we can expect the field to go. The layout is fresh and entertaining."
3,English Class,"Bought this book for my English 2 class, but did not find it interesting or helpful personally. Arrived in great time and packaging though :D"
2,twas ok but i was disappointed,the main reason i bought was expecting to find that awesome music during the scene when li meets on the boat and then escapes from the police to the subway. that music really gets ya going and was probably the best music in the whole movie and it wasn't on the soundtrack. i believe it was composed by craig armstrong who i hope will release it.
2,Stick With Madden 2001,This game is identical to Madden 2001. Don't waste your money going out and buying it. It makes more sense to just upgrade the teams from 2001 because other than that it is no different at all. The music selection in this game makes me want to mute my television. The fact that EA Sports did not put any time and effort into this game should discourage people from buying it. I recommend going out and trying some other football games for Playstation.
5,Exquisite .....,"This cd was and always will be a grand family adventure for the Mason's. How wonderful it must have been for them to be able to create this music together, a better father and son collaboration I know not of. Excellent listening for the home or the highway, I tip my hat to the Mason's."
2,Release handle,Doesn't fit or work as advertised. I may be able to drill the handles out a bit and make them work ....
2,Product was defective,Product was defective. The arm would not go all the way up and allow Elmo to do all his tricks. My two year old nephew didn't find it as amusing as I did...The Spanish was not easy to understand.
4,Nice toy.,"This is a nice toy for a toddler, it does what it says. Doesnt a have an real educational value, just for fun."
3,Interesting but a rehash of other films,"It was a well-produced documentary and is a great way for starting the conversation about what we're eating and how it affects us and the planet as a whole. However, if you've seen some of the bigger films in this category (""Forks Over Knives"", ""Food, Inc."", etc.) then this is going to be mainly a rehash of what you've already heard."
4,A fine mystery and a great homage to New Orleans jazz and history,"It would be ideal if you have some New Orleans jazz CDs playing in the background while you read this, but if you are at all familiar with music by Jelly Roll Morton and the like, you will practically hear it in your mind. The mystery involves the murder of several musicians and will have you entranced. The use of Jelly Roll Morton as a character along with the suggestion that another character is a youthful Louis Armstrong enhances the story for those who are jazz fans. Of course, this is also a must for those interested in New Orleans history. Ultimately, though, it's a well plotted mystery recommended to all."
5,Highly recommend- sexy & cerebral,"A surprisingly poignant and thought-provoking combination of shorts...""Late Summer"" in particular shines as gay-grounded but universally relatable experiences...the writing, acting, and directing for all 4 shorts is diverse, stimulating, and grounding for both gay and straight audiences..."
5,fun but..........,"this game should be rated ""T"".The songs talk about killing ourselves.ladies nakid.songs about sex.you buy this game.10[...]."
5,Way better than the last one,"This game is truly a great one. It has amazing replay value. You can complete the game and you STILL never get bored. I really like the new expansive levels, the awesome graphics, and the REALLY EASY gameplay. It's easy to learn and you can sit there for hours playing and never get bored. Another great upgrade is the ability to make your own skate park and making your own characters. Also, I like unlocking cheats after beating the game with each character. I could go on, but overall, it's just a REALLY GREAT GAME...."
5,Excellent! Like the rest,I have all 4 Pop En Espanol and I have not been dissapointed with a single one. I just wish he would produce more.
4,"Soulful, Duncan really speaks to your heart","I originally bought the CD for the hit 'Barely Breathing', but after listening to the CD, I can honestly say that all of the tracks have something noteworthy. Although the lyrics are a little on the down-trodden side, if the mood fits, wear it!"
2,I'm upset,"The graphics that are in this game are cool. From the players to the stadiums everything seems to be okay. I'm playing defense, with FSU in Doak Campbell Stadium, against the Gators who are 3rd and goal and the Michigan fight song comes on. Sometime the Fighting Irish song also. This upset me but I still play the game. The realism of the BCS standing are very weak as well. I can have the worst team in college, based on a weak conference schedule, and still play for the National Title which is held in the Rose Bowl./Not in real life/ The Bowl games are not held where they are suppose to be held at. For instance the Peach Bowl is held in the Georgia Dome.... NNNNOOOTTT. It is held at Georgia Tech Stadium. I'm a loyal customer to Dream Cast games and I have talked over 36 people into buying your game system because of your sports games alone, but you guys really let me down on this one and I have nothing to brag about to my friends that own other game systems."
3,A 14-year old gamer from Maine,"If you liked Nfl2k1 you might this but you're wasting your money,..... it's basicly the same exact game with some different plays and some different action shots . But basically it's the same game. I was so close to buying this game last week at the mall but my dad said I couldn't then just last night I rented it and I saved myself 35 dollars cause I would not buy this game! Thanks for reading my review..."
3,"One interesting fact, and more than one shot of Ted Koppel","Although this 22 minute Nightline broadcast doesn't have that much to offer, you'd still think ABC would rebroadcast it if only in the hopes of combatting the ""let's bomb those towelheads"" idiocy that's no doubt sprung up in some sectors. The general sentiment, of course, is that Muslims are everywhere and that 99.9% of them aren't evil. If you make any attempt at all to be responsibly informed, this video won't change your life, although you might find the bits about the predominance of muslims in Iowa interesting. I did. Ultimately, this one's for the classroom."
1,Most Booooring Game Ever!,"This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Sure, graphics and sound f/x are awesome, but gameplay is boring and even desperate at times. If you like wasting your time getting lost over and over searching for items and locations this is the game for you, otherwise just borrow it from a friend and see for yourself how bad it is."
1,Long Silent Walk,"I picked up this game, hoping to engage in a compelling and spooky challenge, but I have to say, it bored me senseless. I spent the first two hours simply walking and walking and running and walking through annoying fog. The controls are wonky and often my James would spend a lot of his walking time going in the wrong direction or turning in circles. After two hours of play the only things that happened were finding a map, looking down a well, and meeting a girl in a cemetary, oh, and burning a hell of a lot of virtual calories. I did kill one monster, but only after travelling miles down a path and then having to retrace my steps. I have no desire to turn this game on again and find out anything more. Absolute borefest."
1,boring,read sporkdude's review. he tells no lie about this game. (except for the dead corpses part lol)
1,disappointing,sh2 lived up to its predecessor in that they are both pretty sorry games...not user friendly...stick with RE and you can't go wrong
2,Silent Hill 2,"this game ... big time! i wasted my money on this one. the graphics were ... and it didn't come close to scaring my little sister let alone me. the story line was very weak and i had the game beat in about a week. they went a little crazy with that fog too. what in the world were they thinking?! if you want a great game that will keep your attention i would like to tell you to please, please go for the new resident evil game. now there's a game! i couldn't put that one down. SH2 was so weak i think i forgot i owned it. you know, just threw it in the back of my T.V. stand. SH2 is lucky i am giving it 2 stars, lets just leave it at that."
5,An Excellent Horror Game!,"This game has to be the best survival-horror game ever! Silent Hill 2 has everything from interactive fog to a great storyline! The characters are greatly detailed and the monsters are even better and scarier than the first Silent Hill game. The sound effects in this game is fantastic! The graphics and enviroments are also great in this game! I say it is by far the best scariest game out right now! I don't know why some people are saying that this game is a waste of money, but from my opinion, this game is recommended!"
2,"Slow, tiresome and overrated.","I gave this game all the second chances I could to let it hook me, I really did, but it failed. Why?THE BAD: Slow gameplay (walk around huge areas for hours looking for tiny pieces of info, intermittently bashing creatures ad nauseam). Repetitive. Delays with the animations (esp. when fighting). Terrible camera angles.THE GOOD: Gorgeous game, great mood and best sound yet on PS2. That, however, does not a great game make. Maybe I'm not the genre's biggest fan, but the ""find the key to open the door to fight the monster to get another key"" style of gameplay is TIRED."
4,what a creepy experience,"This game was a lot of fun to play. Do yourself a favor and play through it at least once without the use of the strategy guide. You'll have a much more enjoyable experience without it. I have played throught it three times, and have seen three different endings. This is the only weak part of the game, as none of the endings I have seen so far live up to the inner game story and they leave you wondering about far too much at the end of the game. Other than that small complaint, Silent Hill 2 is a great game that horror genre buffs will have a hard time putting down."
4,this is a cool game,"this is the first horror type game that i've played. i never played silent hill 1 or any of the resident evils. playing this game is kind of like being in a movie that you control. you move from place to place with movie scenes to watch every now and then. the graphics aren't necessarily photo realistic, but they still impress me because the town of silent hill is huge and everything has a lot of detail. i give the audio in this game a perfect 10. all the sound effects sound just how they should. there isn't much music, but when there is it sounds really good. as for control, the camera angles can bug you sometimes, but isn't a big deal. konami did a good job of making this a creepy game. you probably won't be scared, but when you enter some rooms you might wonder what is going to happen next. overall, this is a cool game with a thriller movie atmosphere."
5,Like watching a movie...,"I am not a huge video game fan, but being a movie fan I love playing this game. You can have a room full of people watching one person play, shouting out instructions where to go, what weapon to use, etc. It's creepy, you don't always know what's around the corner. However, I agree with the ""eptiger"" review about the acting parts. The acting/scripted portion of the game is badly written and ""acted"". Not a big deal though. Visual and audio effects are incredible!I bought the help guide to get me through the game. My husband would read it as I played, and he'd only give me hints when I needed help. RPG fans will enjoy this game!"
1,don't waste your money,"Unfortunately, this cd follows the formula of so many other nature cd's, namely: 1. write some sappy, ..., synthesized music, 2. intersperse it with a few nature sounds, but only so the music dominates, and 3. hey! you've got a nature cd! Yeah, this stuff will put you to sleep, but only because its so bad. Actually, the first time I listened to it I was kept awake wondering why I had wasted money on such [stuff], and how much could I get for it in a yard sale. The selections all sound as if they should be theme songs for afternoon movies on Lifetime television, and if you didn't read the titles you would have a tough time telling many of them apart. The final selection is especially laughable, as it consists of grasshoppers and birds chirping in a thunderstorm (again, overshadowed by bad music). Hello, what's wrong with this picture? Bottom line, don't waste your money. I'm sorry I bought it."
2,I detest ETS!,"This book tells you to study EVERYTHING! DUH! The only decent portion of the study guide is the practice test and the explained answers. However, once you take it, it is not useful much. The Content Knowledge Spanish II Praxis is very difficult for those who have not ""studied"" from a book for some time. I HIGHLY recommend the Practice Makes Perfect Series. This book is another way for ETS to make money, go figure. Where is Teddy Roosevelt when you need him? Someone needs to ""bust that trust!"""
4,Nokia phone charger,"This phone charger works just fine and I saved a lot of money compared to Cingular store or Target, etc."
4,Don't even read the last review.,"The person who wrote the last review lumping this album in with the mall metal crap that exists now doesn't know what they are talking about. If anything limp bizkit and associates owe Orange 9mm a huge debt for showing them how to do it right. This album is not a rap/metal album. It is aggressive and loud, but it doesn't fit neatly into some category like some would like it to. Buy it and hear a band throwing it down better than anything thats out now."
3,An interesting take on modern vamire hunting !!!,Blade is the story of the exploits of a half-human half-vamire warrior. who sets out to drive a vampire nation from the earth. His enemy is a vampire lord who plans the down fall of humanity. An excellently choreographed battle in an under ground night club opens the film of course. Blade is filled with bloody combat and minor campiness. A stylish fantasy with a somewhat mediocre story. But I thought Blade was VERY COOL FILM!!!
1,2nd to Battlefield Earth,"Look, I won't delve too much into how Blade reeks (it's not worth it); instead, I'll just say that its special effects are its only decent quality (but that its plot can be easily deciphered eons before its next series of events happen). So, in conclusion (and unless you're infatuated with bad movies) don't waste your money and/or time on Blade."
2,a passable action movie,"The action sequences are very good, but the rest of the movie is a waste of time. Since when are thousand-year old vampire shrines buried under New York City? Vampire sunscreen? Stupid. And for the last time stop trying to scientifically explain and cure vampires. They are supernatural and should stay that way."
5,I Want that Samurai!,"Lets just say that this has to be one of the best vampire movies I have seen up to date! The gore is great, the action is superb and the Rave scene in the begining is just awesome! The music gives the movie a great dark feeling to it, yet it energizes you to cheer when he dices a vampire to pieces. I think Wesley Snipes portrays Blade superbly! Even though he doesent say much, he doesen't have to! His dark coat, and shades with the armour popping out, gives the enemy the message that Blade is not someone you can fool with! The samurai is the coolest! I want one! Truly a great movie!"
4,Cool Vampire Flick,"An action packed and intense vampire flick, combined with ballsy drama and good cast (Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson)."
2,BLAME CANADA!!!!!!!!,"Ok the ONLY reason this gets even 2 stars is because it is the actual movie, and Blade is effing awesome, BUT I think this is the Canadian version(french credits/synopsis on box yet film in English, also only other language is French). So I dont know the deal with Canadian special features but there are none. I remember getting Blade on dvd many years ago and there being at least some special features with alternate endings and such. The only reason I buy Blu-rays and DVDs is for the special features. If I wanted to JUST watch the movie in HD I would use less than legal means and watch it for free."
3,M... pretty good ... but,"I know : a vampire movie, right ? But still, its an action movie and not a horror one ... IT has action and all ... but there are some really bloody scenes ! Seriously , no under 18 should watch this ... for example the scene when Frost was biting the hell out of that stupid cop... blood everywhere, and Eeesh ... Bottom line : action is action ... horror is horror ... You want an action movie : you should focus on action !"
1,This is for the Canadian Blu-ray,"The movie is the incorrect aspect ratio and it's distracting. Sadly that isn't the only video issue. The picture quality if horrible almost as if the movie wasn't only cropped, but also stretched. No special features. The movie itself is awesome. Great action and effects that mostly hold up to today's standards. I recommend the movie itself, but be sure to buy the American version. (It was available when I ordered. I wish I had waited.)"
5,The Era of Vampires has begun...,"Now get me if I am wrong but this movie is very good, I also think that many people think that since the sequel (Blade II) is better because it has better effects. Well although some of these effects are cheesy, this movie is one of the best vampire movies of all time.If you have'nt read the comics then i suggest reading them for background support.The DVD's special features are also very good such as: Featurette ""La Magra"", including the original endingFeaturette ""Designing Blade""Featurette ""The Origins of Blade""Featurette ""The Blood Tide""If you want to watch a good action movie then I will have to recommend Blade.Colin Nickell"
1,Blade steelbook,Package had no protection!! So when I got my steelbook it had gotten all damaged! I've been waiting for a chance to get this steelbook for a while and I finally found one I got it with dents because the sender did not offer any protection!
3,Where are the extras?!,"I know that New Line is no more, but come on WB! You can definitely do better than that! Very good comic book film, but it needs its extras."
3,Blade excessive punching wasn't called for made him look bad,"overall a very good action flick the strength the jump scene from the hospital window, slow motion of the bullets, a lot of good stuff. The concept were good the overplaying is what hurt the movie.The jumps and bullets can be seen in the matrix."
4,NIGHTLINE,"Although this film is much shorter (22min) than ""Inside Mecca"" and doesn't cover the Hajj in as great a detail, it was interesting and included a couple of things that were not in the other longer film. For instance, ""Inside Mecca"" showed the sacrifice of the goats but did not go into the fact that the meat of all those animals are donated to the poor. It filled in the gap between cruelty and compassion. I enjoyed this video but still recommend that after this one, you should watch ""Inside Mecca"" for more details. This is more of a summary."
4,"'Bambi' is entertaining, modern French mystery...","The main character is a nurse in-training called ""Bambi"" by an odd doctor who treats her for fainting spells...says her legs shake like a new born deer trying to stand. After some unexplained disappearences, ""Bambi"" develops a suspicion about who is responsible, which puts her and those close to her in danger. The guessing game that the doctor plays with her is interesting. As is her dream... While it wasn't Oscar material, I still enjoyed the film."
4,Refreshing,"I liked this book. I cannot say the beginning really got me but towards the middle and the end it was amazing. I really enjoyed Porter and his sense of humor and also Lee and the way she felt. I think this was the first interracial novel where the ""white guy"" had the issue with race and didnt just think it was no big deal. And the fact that it was very real and not a fairytale like ending was unique as well. I really felt for these characters especially in the end. It was almost like my feelings for them went in reverse. At first I had a hard time with Lee and her always bringing up race then at the end I started understanding Lee but disliked Porter for his actions. Kim McLarin did an excellent job with this book, and its refreshing to read a interracial novel where sex was not the main ingredient it was more about the issue which was race."
5,WOW! Truly a great book!!,This is my first review but I could NOT remain silent about this book. It was absolutely great! Kim McLarin takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Any author that can make you fall in love with the characters then make you angry at one then root for the one who made you angry is truly a genius. This book really makes you think plus it give you a very real ending. I loved this book and will be reading it again.
5,Great product for a reasonable price,This brand hair color is a great product and does not fade or get brassy. All different colors that I used are all just as good.
4,Just a couple things,"the game was pretty good over all. I liked the graphics, the movements, and I liked how the people didn't make it to where you could cheat as much.The things that I don't like about it is that; two people can't tackle the same person at the same time, and when the QB rolls out and one of the defencive linemen hit him and he just keeps on rolling like nothing happened to him, You can't put your created players on the franchise, and all pro cheats way too much. Oh yeah and last but not least there should be a better pick of collage players in the draft every year in the franchise."
3,"O.K. , but lacking what the othes had","This game was alright, except for for thing. I didn't like the feel of the game. It has excellent graphics, cool story, and some nice weapons. The thing I didn't like was the idea of taking it to such a low brow area. Like in RE:Survivor, it takes place on an island, which kind of takes the fun out of it. I think you should be able to explore more of Racoon City, throw in some new enemys. This game just bored me. In this game, you just kill zombies, which is the jist of the game. But, unlike RE 1, 2, and 3, it felt obscure. When I started playing it, I just thought it was like a remake of Survivor, which ...[stunk] really bad. Next time, make the game a little more appealing. Or maybe it's just me."
3,"OK , BUT.....................","I Just beat this game a couple days ago and let me say that it was really dissapointing. Its not the graphics are bad, they are fine. It wasnt the controls they are basically the same as Re 1, 2, 3. There just wasnt that extra something to make it intresting, The cut scenes seemed lame, I was basically bored the whole time playing the game and don't remember ever really having that excitment thing going at any parts. Beating the game was more of a relief than anything, This game will never be played by me again. 1 more thing it seemed like in this game the puzzles were just annoying, You easily have to spend 3 hours gametime just running back and fourth with nothing to kill and it just gets frustrating. I like the RE series but this one is a Letdown, But still, You have to have it for your RE collection."
1,Resident Evil: Code Vernica X,This game totally sucks majorly me and my dad were trying to play this game we got on the first level and then couldn't even get off the first level with reading the instruction manual too and cheats off of cheats codesguides .com worst game ever the first level your stuck in cell in complete darkness and keep walking around and then get no where. Don't waste your money on this there are plenty of other PS1 and PS2 games that you can waste your money on. Oh and you can play PS1 games on the PS2 for those of you who don't know that.
3,I'm Scared...,"I am not very impressed with the graphics, they should have took some of that graphic ability they used on the cinemax clips threw out the game. Which are really cool to daze apon. The camera angles, uhm, why is it when your looking at the screen with your gameing charecter, you see your charecter looking at you, when she should be looking at the monsters you can't see, eating at you, when there, where? Infront of you, terrible camera angles! I give it 3 stars, cause atlease it scared my wife, and thats all ways fun.."
4,Awesome game.. BUT Solid graphics,This game is ok and scary n all but the graphic is sometimes too solid and not that realistic.. i prefer Silent hill 2 and 3 coz i think the game is more better then this. BUT this game earned a 4.8 starz for the storyline and the + (DMC)demo..
3,maybe it was'nt for me,"To start off with i got it for 9.99 in games exchange.I played resident evil before, so i thought id try this out.It is more of a finding secrets puzzle game,the puzzles and looking for key's is what got me a bit annoyed.I more of a fast action survival horror fan eg devil may cry ,onimusha[a bit different].The graphics were good without a doubt but it was more different from resident evil 3 which had more action on.If you run out of ammo for a gun, then you are basically done the only option is to run.And if the zombies get you it will be annoying .But it still gives you creeps i did'nt get aroun to finishing it off cuz i got board."
2,scared me and frustrated me,"This game was truly terrifying when i first picked it up. But unfortunatly, like all resident evils, the fright didnt last due to1)bad lighting effects2)Corny looking zombies at close range3)inability to work the items or to find the right oneI mean come on. You have have found broze emblem, so what? You have found Strange alloy, and? it took me forever to put it all together. and the worst part is, im still havent beaten this sad little game. (sigh) dont waste ur money on this."
2,Nothing New,"This game series has gotten old. RE 1 was awesome. RE 2 was even better, RE 3 was pretty good, but by RE CVX, it's just old. It's the same old solve a puzzle, shoot a freakish creature. Nothing new. I quit playing about a quarter of the way through. If you're a die hard RE fan, then get it. But if you're just a run of the mill PS2 player like me who doesn't follow any game series religiously, then pass this one up."
2,Not for a person looking to shoot **** up!,"If you are looking for a good shootem up game that has a great storyline with it, don't buy this game. The best part of the game was the demo of Devil May Cry which is unbelievable. Resident Evil however is horrible grafics for playstation 2 and worse controls. In the time it takes to open a door you could run to your firdge and back and still wait and you go through lots of doors. If you are looking into this game for the holidays I would Seriously suggest get Devil May Cry instead because it doesn't have the hard controls and it has amazing graffics"
3,Not her best work,"Live Your Life Be Free is fifty-one minutes and eleven seconds long and was released on October 14, 1991. Live Your Life Be Free is Belinda Carlisle first failure. The cassette did not chart and only one song of the five singles charted. Songs like I Plead Insanity and Little Black Book are not that great. Then again I did like Half the World and Love Revolution. It is hit or miss if you want to buy Live Your Life Be Free.

4,"Excellent album, but not her best","This is Belinda's fourth album and quite different from her first three solo albums. It is in general harder and livelier than her previous ones and quite an optimistic album. One can feel that Belinda had quite some fun and joy during the making of this album.Best Tracks on this album are ""I Plead Insanity"" (what a beat!), ""Love Revolution"", ""Loneliness Game"" (the softest song on the album, a reminder of her past) and the title track ""Live Your Life Be Free"".The album contains 11 tracks with a total length of 51:09. Highly recommended."
5,Classic,"I dont know why this movie has such bad reviews, its really one of the better animes out there. It consist of the main hero Amon, a great swordsman, on a journy of revenge.Theres an evil empire whose recruiting new soldiers and Amon competes with others to become one of the soldiers. Theres tons of characters with unique traits and the movie takes several twists.Its hard to describe the exact nature of the plot but what i will say is that if you dont give this movie a chance, your missing out!"
3,An Uneven Work...,"An uneven work containing some of the most splendid insights ever penned, alongside much malicious superstition and stupendous ignorance, understandable in terms of its location in history. Prone to meander, it propounds a deeply dualistic system that has inveigled many readers into spiteful, even lethal, conflicts with their chosen out-group. The effect on the heart is equally uneven, with a flowering of blessing and love for those of a benign disposition, and an astonishing crabbiness in the obsessive and the doctrinaire. I can only recommend the piece with a caveat. ""You are responsible for what you believe; let the buyer beware!""Reviewed by Jeremiah Coxauthor, Redesigning God"
1,Holy bible,I never recieved this product but was given a full refund. It turns out that this is not the bible that my brother wanted so that worked out.
3,small print,Not sure how to enlarge the print on this one. I need super large print for my mother in law.
3,Easy to use but..,"It is easy to navigate and has a good size print (without zooming in).The only problem I have with it is I don't know what book of the Bible I'm on.All in all, it's an okay buy!!"
1,No way to get it onto my Kindle,I bought this item to download into my Kindle and there is no way to get tech support except to pay for it. I wanted to download tis to my computer and from there to my Kindle and I can't get anyone at amazon to help.
3,Needs to be more user friendly,I wanted the KJV which is why I chose this app. But I find it needs to be more user friendly. When finding a passage you can go to the table of contents get the old or new testament and then book and chapter but I wish it would then have somewhere on the page the book and the chapter you are reading. Other apps are easier to use and find where you want to be but are not KJV. Over all I will continue to use it.
2,Needs better organization / chapters,"I bought this hoping to use it while at church so that I could more quickly 'jump' to the chapter and verse for the sermon. Instead, it's a little cumbersome as there are no bookmarks / chapters directly linked. Or if they are, I can't figure out how to make them work properly...For .99 it's all right but I think I may purchase a better organized copy at some point in the future. This one doesn't reflect what book you're in, and it's really just not very user-friendly."
1,not worth it,This was a waste of a dollar. It was not easy to manuver through this Bible. I was hoping for something better. Good thing it was only $.99 because I already deleted it from my kindle and Amazon account. Not a good deal.
1,Wrong Author or Wrong Editor,"This version of the bible wasn't written by God, as none of the versions have been. If this one had been by God, it shouldn't need an editor. Judging by the other reviews, the editor did a crappy job anyway. Maybe it was written by God and the editors were studio heads or TV network executives. As you were... paying for a bible... when there are free versions everywhere."
5,Must have,"I use my Bible for Church.lay in bed to study my Bible,for my Sunday School lesson.Always carry my Bible with me"
1,Not helpful,"I listened to this every night, for a month. This might have put me to sleep. But, it has not helped my memory,at all. Not worth the money."
1,HARD CASE CRIME doesn't cut it this time. ZERO COOL just ain't cool!,"I have read and enjoyed almost all of the titles from Hard Case Crime; however, this one, I'm sad to say, just does not make it. Poor development of character, grade school sytax, witless plot, and rambling jibberish make this book almost impossible to finish. In fact, I just barely made it through the first quarter of the book before I had to ditch it. I almost didn't include it on the shelf with the other 42 fantastic Hard Case Crime hits. Sorry, but this one ain't worth a fraction of the paper it's scribbled on."
2,Is not worth the money,"I bought this book thinking it will give me all the required tools to analyze and evaluate physicians' revenue cycle...unfortunately, this book didn't meet those expectations. It has a great article about carved-out services but that is as much as I will be taking out of this book. I read the book in three hours...is not worth the money!"
