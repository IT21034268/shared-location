4,"Hot, memorable disco hits of 70-80's","Easy to listen, Special music was arranged for most of the songs, push people back to the party/disco of 70-80. It's worth to own one."
1,Entry-Level carving knives,"These knives are not what they are cracked up to be. I have two of them, and they sit in the bottom of my chip-carving bag. If you want a high quality knife, I suggest you buy one from Rich Notto. Wayne Barton's books and patterns are great, but his knives are very low quality."
1,Great Unit - Lousy Software copy protection,"I'm very impressed with the handheld GPS unit. Does all it should and the screen is real easy to see in the car.However... I'm greatly handicapped because the company puts copy protection on its DirectRoute software. It installs on my new Tablet PC (Toshiba M205) but won't run because of the external CD drive.The company ""promises"" a fix, but as I've searched the web for user groups I've seen this over many months.I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Not the best choice?,"It is ok, but not the best as the sound still a bit weak. I mean not as expect.."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the first set I bought of Magnetic Mosaics, purchased for my K-1 Special Education classroom. They were kind of difficult, but good with a team of students and my guidance. However, when I ordered online for the set I purchased for my six year old grand-daughter, I learned they were totally different - the tiles were only 1/4 "" big and much, much too small to be fun -even for most adults. My 33 year old son spent hours trying to work one of the patterns from the kit and only completed about 1/2 of it. Too hard to be fun - unless you really like detailed art work and have a lot of time to work on it."
2,Benetton Sport - Benetton,"the scent does not last long, the lotion did not come with plastic packaging. I wont buy again thi item"
5,Good Book,"I loved this book, because it made me think about my own life and it made me laugh out loud."
3,something lacking,I really wanted to like this book. I enjoy reading about other cultures and immigrant experiences (I knew my immigrant grandparents very well). But I found the dialogue stilted and the character development lacking. I did find the story line interesting and it was a quick read. But the end left me very disappointed. Too simplistic.
2,A Disappointment,"I have been very disappointed with this album. The biggest problem is the introductory material. Each track starts with an introduction, first in English and then in Spanish. While it is nice to know something about the songs, it is a long span of talking before each track and it quickly (like, the second time through) becomes very irritating having to wait for the end of the intro to hear each song. If they had only made the introductions into separate tracks it would have been much better-- you could skip over the intros when you didn't want to hear them. The other problem is a matter of personal taste-- after wading through the intro material, most of the songs are just not appealing to me. Yes, there are some fun instruments and unusual sounds, but for the most part the songs themselves just don't move me. For kids Spanish songs, I much prefer the Sesame Street ""Fiesta Songs!"" album and the Jose-Luis Orozco albums (especially ""Diez Deditos"")."
1,Not as expected,"This book has a 20 page introduction on Asher and then about then about 20 pages of picutures and drawings. The rest of the pages are copies of two books written in ancient english that is very hard to understand even for an engineer. The drawings included are mostly cross sections of moldings, pillars and some truss diagrams (the truss section was interesting). It the kind of book you would thumb thru and say that is sorta interesting and then never pick it up again. I am returning it."
5,Excellent Product,"I, Captain America support endorse this product as one of the finest and purest creatine supplements on the open market. Furthermore the tabs are much easier to swallow than any powders. The labeling is also honest and straightforward, as oppose to many creatine products that attempt to fool the user into a loading phase."
4,good shorts,The shorts are a bit stiff but that goes away. They last forever and are very functional.
1,not quit sure this is new,It took over 3 week to recieve.Also the package looks new but I'm not quit sure the product is new as welland when its operating make some high-pitched noise that anoyingmy ears when I'm driving
3,Petite wings.,"The picture for this dragon is very misleading. My dragon's wing span is a mere inch and does not have a 6 inch wing span as the info says. Nonetheless, I am mildly pleased."
2,Mediocre Product,Nice looking unit with good CD play and battery life. Radio Tuner and reception is poor. Lack of radio presets makes unit not competitive with newer models.
3,Go for a Digital Radio/MP3 Combo,"I've owned this shower radio for a long time (approx. 7 years) now and have been decently happy with it. I used to create CDs to use with it, but as everything has moved away from CDs, I generally now only use it for its radio. I've moved around a lot in the time I've owned the radio, but where I currently am, the bathroom (with this device) apparently gets terrible radio reception. Whenever I move around the bathroom it creates so much static, that I have become fed up and am searching for a digital replacement.Also, the ""fog free"" mirror started to fog up after a few months of use.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the radio for a long time and, therefore, would still recommend it. I just feel like you can get something more for your money at this point."
4,CLASSIC ROY,"A true artist and voice, covering songs that you would not expect to hear Roy sing and i again purchased this CD because i had the albums only on Record. A must buy if you are a Orbison Fan."
2,Why so small??????,"Although I am a lover of original instruments, I can't been enthusiastic about this recording. The one-on-a-part string section doesn't work. I have only listened to #5, but the viola responses on the first movement sound like a rebec player trying to scratch out a romantic tune- it needs a full section. Everything is so clear that you get no feeling for the impression Beethoven was creating. If I wanted to know every note he wrote I could just look at the score. Wow, I sound like an anti-early instrument guy!!!! That's truly weird.I attended a fantastic performance last Sunday of #3 with a Massachusetts original instrument ensemble, the Arcadia Players. This was a small orchestra, but still there 5 or so violins on a part. What a difference!"
3,Rectangular pieces,The pieces are rectangles so you have to put them in the right way. Younger kids do not realize they are not square and it is frustrating that the pieces do not fit in the grid. We do have fun with this game but I keep reminding my kids to turn the piece around so it fits.
1,No Useful Information,The other reviewer who mentioned that this book has no useful information if you are actually looking to build one of things was spot on.
5,Well worthwhile,"I purchased this based on the recommendations, and I am happy I did. Barry Manilow really is the consummate professional -- he's charming, funny, and exceptionally talented. He's been doing this a long time, and it shows. I was so happy to see him sing ""All the Time,"" one of my favorites. He does two songs from his play ""Harmony,"" ""Every Single Day"" and ""Stars in the Night,"" and you can see that they hold a special place in his heart. Like someone else reviewed, I never thought of Barry Manilow as sexy until this video -- he has a certain confidence and grace, and yes, he is definitely sexy. ""Eat your heart out, Ricky Martin,"" indeed."
5,A must have!,"If you're a fan, of course you've bought it and love it. But what struck me was the number of new fans who might be generated by this DVD. This concert is a wonderful showcase for Barry - the musician and the man. The taping gave an intimate, you-are-there quality that was very special. A great gift for someone who has never seen Barry in concert."
2,Not so good....:(,"This dvd is less than an hour long. Unfortunately, you learn absolutely nothing for half of it. Most of the movements are repetitive in content and the explanations are not even good. Also, the editing is very poor, as the instructor messes up his descriptions way too many times for a professional dvd. I find it hard to believe that ""Hypno"" put this out, since his stuff is typically much better. Air walk is not a common dvd topic, so I appreciate the undertaking. However, I don't think anyone should spend money on this particular dvd. I would watch it for free because there are about 5 total minutes of useful information. Hopefully this guy can try again and deliver a real instructional dvd."
4,incisive & astute,"What's great about Ishmael Reed as a polemicist is that he actually thoroughly researches his facts, so when he holds forth about media distortions of rates of (eg) crack use among white suburbanites, black working-class single mothers being falsely projected as the archetypal welfare-claimants etc, he's not just venting inchoate rage. The introductory section of this book is a masterpiece of close analysis, the individual essays ranging from the interesting to the excellent. His claims about the contemptible misrepresentation of black men in America in huge swathes of the media are, I think, true - and at the least, convincingly argued. His style is clear, direct and accessible. A very good read, & I think the best of his books of collected non-fiction."
3,OK,"This conditioner rinses clean and smells great. It does not condition very well unless you leave it in for at least 3 minutes. A nice side effect is that letting it sit for a while moisturized my scalp and relieved my dandruff and itch.It didn't do much for my hair loss after 3/4 of a bottle. I still lose clumps if I don't sleep and eat well. Bottom line, getting 8 hours of sleep every night and minding your nutrition will help a lot more than anything over the counter.I recently tried the Nature's Gate line of shampoos and conditioners, and strongly recommend them over Avalon Organics."
4,mostly good but....,"Despite what anyone says, Jerome Pradon's Judas is horrible.His singing is the most atrocious, awful thing I have heard in ages. The guy is not a trained vocalist, from what I hear on this disc. Very throaty, forced, pushed, and whiny. And if you've seen the DVD, his acting wasn't much better...."
3,WORST MARY AND JUDAS!,"Ok, Mary Magdalene .. and Judas in this ""new"" stage productionARE HORRIBLE! .....no offesne but Judas is Whiney and Mary cant sing her way out of a paper bag if she had directions...sorry but its the truth, But Glenn is an Ok Jesus notice i said ""OK""not the best but not the worst...But the reason i didnt rate this only 2 is because Trial By Pilate finally had some emotion to itthen besides just saying ""one"" he screams ONE!!!!.. it finalyl sounds remotely real......."
4,"Beloved book, beloved tape","My husband and I have a tape recording of this album from our college days. I just found out that there is finally a CD of this which came out just this year although I have not had a chance to get the CD yet. Richard Burton is excellent as the Pilot, although the Little Prince seems to be older than one expects from the drawings in the book. The background music is simple but appropriate. This reading is faithful to the English translation by Katharine Woods. I found out there's a new reading by Richard Gere and Haley Joel Osment, but I couldn't find out what translation they used."
3,Good but not great,"This one definitly has a familiar theme to it. Namely ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". While not as good it still has an interesting storyline. My only problem with this film is the lack of sci-fi effects. Only a brief encounter with a flying saucer. Well acted and the transfer to DVD is very good. Like i said, good not great."
3,"Funny, in a strange sort of way","This movie is the most obvious remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. I like both films, but besides the hilarious special effects and the casting of an American actress as English, I prefer this film. The stranger, played by Helmut Dantine, is very believable in the part, maybe just because of his Austrian accent. Also, the slightly romantic departure from the plot of The Day the Earth Stood Still warmed my unscientific heart. The messages are the same: anti-war, and that was very timely in the early 1950's. Perhaps it's still quite timely...."
5,Absolutely marvelous,"Its been a rare experience that there is a cd that I listen to all the way though time and time again. This is one of them. Anywhere I go Nat's music travels with me. Excellent production, great lyrics, and a passion for the work comes through in every track. Not to mention a voice that won't stop. Looking forward to the next cd with great anticipation."
2,Packaging and sound are unworthy of the music.,"I'll just endorse what other reviewers have said about the cheap,shoddy cardboard packaging of these disks. As for the sound quality,I've only listened to the first CD,and other reviewers suggest that the sound on the remaining two is much superior. I hope so! On my equipment,at least, the first CD is flat-out unlistenable; the distortion whenever the decibel level jumps sounds like gale-force sleet being blown against the speakers. I don't think it's a problem with my system; I have quite a few CDs of remastered 78s from before the hi-fi era,and have never had any of them sound even remotely this bad. I can't believe Bluebird/RCA would allow even one of these disks to go out sounding like this; is there perhaps some sort of quality-control issue here?"
2,Not the great light everyone says it is,"GREAT IDEA, made into ""made in china junk"" i paid 50.00 for this light it should have been 10.00 the solar panel if lifted all the way grabs the power switch and when lowered "" SNAP"" the frame pops over the switch breaking the glue the holds the panel . i can no longer lift the panel and must charge it face down . the lights only shine out or up , you cant spin the light around to bounce it off a table like a normal light , its in your eyes or lighting up the sky above me , this does me no good at all bottom line , just don't waste your money , buy something else UPDATE :Well i just got another one of these for free because it needs a battery ....so i wanted to get one ...YOU CAN'T forget it NOWHERE ! i even called WAGAN NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY'S anywhere in the USA ..... so it will work on D cells but no more rechargeable function ......WAGEN IS JUST A RESELLER OF DISPOSABLE GARBAGE !"
5,Great Book! Strengthens Understanding - Builds Faith & Love,"I've been a Catholic all my life, and have believed with all my heart and soul! Unfortunately, the last few years I've been confronted with the concept of ""Faith Alone"" like never before. Having married a very god loving faithful Protestant -- I've had difficulty reconciling the the Catholic and Protestant doctrines of Justification. I found myself uncomfortable with the notion of ""Faith Alone"" from the first time I heard it and I began seeking the theological evidence for the Catholic Doctrine of Justification which I felt so strongly in my heart. ""Not by faith alone"", answered my questions, gave me respect for the Protestant position but strenghtened my belief in the Catholic Doctrine, helped me connect my faith, love and feelings with the evidence, and helped me explain the Catholic Doctrine to my Protestant husband in terms he could understand too."
3,"It should have been 5, but that DIRECTION!!...","The material, the actors, the show, are all hilarious from beginning to end. This SHOULD have been a DVD to treasure in its entirety... BUT. In adapting the piece to the TV screen, the director (Paul Kafno, I name names!) has gone berserk! Incessantly cutting to the audience reacting to the jokes, instead of allowing US to react; cutting to close-ups when it is vital to the joke that we see the full stage; a positive genius for having the camera in the wrong place at the wrong time; and at least half a dozen (based on audience reaction) jokes we don't get to see because the camera is showing the afore-mentioned reactions; all serve to undercut what could have been a perfect gem"
5,Twisted And Hilarious,"Well worth your time and money......yes, they do manage to cram it all in, my kids loved it (it's how they wished *all* Shakespeare was). It's the ending you always wanted to really see for Hamlet, we *knew* Titus was going to be a cooking show, Othello you have to see (because you wouldn't imagine *this* one!), how fast can you possible run through English history anyway...Henry who? And the best part is they manage to keep the story lines intact, so it's not sacrilegious. An absolutely great way to storm the Bard.....belongs in every Shakespeare collection.....*way* too funny to pass up."
5,A favorite of mine,"I first saw this wonderful insanity on the ""Today"" show, years ago, when the performers did the football sequence. I knew that I'd have to see it for real someday.Since then, my husband and I have seen the live performance 6 times, locally.Of course we had to have the dvd as well.I marvel at the actor's ability to REMEMBER all those lines, and to survive the physicality (?) of doing the play.You don't really have to know a lot about Shakespeare to enjoy this, but it helps.FYI, I'm 68. And I'll go see this play any time."
4,Harrow House owes Shirley Jackson a Thank You.,"This is a great book, despite early comparisons to The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill, and most recently Rose Red.There will always be studies in the paranormal circles of haunted houses and the people who claim to have ""special powers."" As we watch and read these studies, we often wonder, why the heck these people? Are they all psychologically damaged, emotionally needy people who are looking for the one thing to completely set them over the edge?Probably not, but that's the mixed bag you get with the psychics who are invited to study Harrow House in Watch Point, NY. A home with a storied past, most reently a fire tahat destroyed the school it used to harbor, it vibrates with the energies of past inhabitants, a battery which stores the most destructive of memories.I recommend this book for the ewasy-going style of Douglas Clegg and his ability to make you feel for even the most hateful charaters."
2,The book builds to a quick ending.,"This books starts out like very interesting. I kept waiting for the supernatural to take hold, but instead I had to read 200 pages of character profile. When they finally reach the house your expecting the horror to begin. Instead everything happens in the last 20 pages. If you skip to the end you will find out everything you need to know about the book. Unfortunate because I thought the Halloween man was good."
1,Not worth the price,"Nice design and all, but it dont do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money."
2,Good but not as good as my old Norelco,Bought this as a replacement electric shaver. Am a Norelco user now but wasn't totally pleased with this replacement - mainly not as good - in the closeness and smoothness of the shave ( as compared to my old Norelco shaver).
3,Phillips Norelco 1060 arcitec,"The product look, style, features, travel charger, stand, and weight are all great! However the shave is not as close a it should be. My old panasonic 2 blade system cuts a closer shave in half the time. The shaver also does not do well if you have to shave a shorter beard growth, like a second shave later in the same day. It takes a very long time to get a close acceptable shave."
1,cable did not work well,"could be no fault of seller, rather, the manufacturer, but this cable does not work well, the picture fades out to VERY pink, and distorted, then goes back to looking correct..... over and over... This is running from my Uverse receiver, to my Hauppauge PVR-150 TV card in my PC."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS,THIS DVD WAS TERRIBLE. IM A TRINA FAN BUT SHE CANNOT ACT. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD B/C YOUR NOT GETTING A FULL LENGTH MOVIE ON 30 MINS. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU SAVE YOUR MONEY IF YOUR PLANNING ON BUYING THIS. I WISH I HAD SAVED MINE.
1,"good luck,, mine was DOA","Mine arrived dead on arrival. i put the batteries in and nothing happened. overall, it seemed very cheap and flimsy. it doesn't come with a power cord to plug into the wall. instead, you need to put 6 AA batteries in it. If you want the power cord it costs extra and you have to send away for it + shipping. I can't say whether it fixes scratches well. Hopefully you will have better luck than me."
1,"Quality, not quantity!","Would I have purchased this book, had I the opportunity to examine it? No. The print is too small. Some songs are incomplete. e.g. Gigi. I suggest fewer songs, much better choice and original size print."
2,Could be a great book.,"I received this book for Christmas 2010. It could be a great book, but I give this particular book a low rating because there are two sets of pages 719 to 780 and pages 793 to 849 are missing completely. If you get this book check the page numbering carefully before marking it up.I will be contacting Amazon today about return and replacement.The Ultimate Fake Book (for C Instruments)"
2,Disappointed,"From reading other reviews, I expected a book of many recognizable songs with accurate chords that would be useful in fulfilling special requests. I was disappointed to find few popular song requests in the book and hard to play chord combinations for a ""fake book"" with little musical accompaniment."
1,"""Heart of Rock & Roll""","Hokay, so you can't list all the songs in the book. How about if it has a particular song. Huey Lewis & the News, ""Heart of Rock & Roll""??? I'm looking everywhere for it. Any answers???"
2,Incredibly Inaccurate,"This book is incredibly inaccurate. A large portion of the songs have incorrect root notes, wrong and/or missing chords, misprints (flats that should be sharps, etc..) and out-of-sequence lyrics. The book is good for jogging the memory, but unless you are familiar w/ the tunes and have a good ear, it can't be relied on."
4,Great Book for Jam Sessions and Sing-Alongs,"Love this book. Admittedly, there are about 1000 songs in this book that I would probably never play. But it sure is handy for situations like when friends and family visit and want to have a sing-along. Folks can gather around the book and will undoubtedly find many songs that strike a nostalgic chord with them.Suggestion---put these Fake Books into an iPad App!Oh, and the chord charts at the back are really helpful. I've played guitar for 40 years but still need to occasionally look up a crazy jazz chord."
2,Quickly becomes grating,"After a couple of these songs, the novelty sure wears off in a big way. The idea of trying to jump-start some of these just plain worn-out tunes such as Little Red Caboose, I've Been Working on the Railroad, of Skip to My Lou by reworking them in yet another musical genre is noble. But the younger kids don't really like the arrangements (neither do I), and older kids are already bored to death by the retreads. Like so many other attempts to exploit the kid's music market, this recording grates rather than elates.Your best bet is to check out the CD at your local library, let the kids listen to it for a couple of weeks, and spend your cash on some Trout Fishing in America CDs."
5,Yes!,"This album is just right. A very nice blend of Dancehall, Reggae, Hardcore techno. It's awesome. Great album all the way thru. It goes from hard to soft, fast to slow, and it's just right. Hooray for this album."
2,Beginners only,"Easy and quick to finish. There is an above average trader psychology section, but the trading methods are very very basic TA and there is no shortage of self promotion of his webpage and software. Written and intended for an entry level stock trader, anyone more experienced should pass on this."
5,cat,This product is AMAZING!!!!!Very durable.Have had it for a couple years now and it still looks like its in mint condition.Very adorable
1,Worst purchase in a long time.,I have owned my vocopro for about a year and half. In that time I have only used it 3 times. The DVD reader has died and to get it replaced I was quoted $200. I only paid $265 for it new. I bought it because I was told it was the best. Trust me it is junk. Now I have a vocopro paper weight.
5,Upscale taste,"I first had this tea at a local upscale breakfast/brunch/lunch restaurant and kept returning just for the tea. I was surprised to find it on Amazon and ordered a supply. Great way to start the morning. It definitely does not taste like grocery store tea. Very smooth, clear color, satisfying with no ""woodsy"" taste sometimes found in generic teas. I highly recommend this tea: a great way to start the morning, afternoon pick-me-up, or evening warm-up. Great product."
4,A must read for anyone looking to a better future.,"181 pages chock full of building techniques and illustrations thorough enough to get anyone started on their own strawbale home. I would have enjoyed more details on foundations, but there are books specifically for them. Enjoy this book then build your own comfort zone. Printed and nound in China."
3,Not really my kind of music,I purchased this because one of the songs (Wanting Memories) was played at my father's funeral. I really like that song but the rest are just to much gospel for my taste. But if that is your music style then you probably will like this disk because the group really has some very good talent.
4,More good tales from the Twilight Zone,"Well, we're up to the 33rd installment of this timeless series geared to SF fans everywhere. The DVD releases are clean and clear, restoring footage cut when viewed on syndicated T.V. Also on the DVD is a history of the TZ and a short bio on Rod Serling.This particular release (#33) is only marred by the insertion of episode #151, ""The Encounter"". This particular story has already been included in the DVD series in ""Treasures of the Twilight Zone"". I don't see the need to have it included twice in the same collection -- it wasn't all that good in any event and there are still episodes which haven't been printed a first time yet. However, I'll buy installment #33 to get ""The Little People"" and ""No Time Like the Past"".Other than that, I think you'll find this DVD a welcome addition to your growing collection.~P~"
3,"Musically, very good. Ethically, very bad!","Musically, I'd rate this album very good. It was recorded as a demonstration of some of the songs written by the Coreys. However, ethically I'd have to rate it as very bad.Buddy Jewell only contracted to have them make 300 copies of this album to showcase their songwriting. (I own one of the original 300 pressed.)However, since Buddy's win on Nashville Star in May 2003, someone has pressed additional copies of this album to capitalize on Buddy's name -- copies that Buddy has NOT been paid for. These are illegal boot-leg copies and thus the VERY BAD rating for ethics.Most of the songs are pretty good, and Buddy's warm, mellow voice adds a lot to them, musically speaking. I especially like the catchy tune ""Parrothead Paradise"". But sales of this album do nothing to help Buddy Jewell's career, and instead line the pockets of bootleggers. I'd strongly suggest that you purchase the authorized self-titled album instead.Thank you.Ma_Hubbard, a Buddy Jewell fan."
1,Cowboy boot: History art Culture Function,Not worth the money. Nice photos but many just different shots of the same people (probably friends of the author!) I have many cowboy boot books and this is the least worthwhile of my collection. Save your money.
1,hyped up for a massive fall,"SSD were one of those bands,every review in a magazine praised them as the ultimate punk band.as i live in england,the early eighties were spent listening to ""discharge,rudimentary peni,chaos uk"".not until around 83 did i sample the delights of american punk.""bad brains,necros,soa and minor threat blew me away.when i finally heard SSD...i was let down,what makes it worse i bought ""break it up""....nothing but crappy rock..."
1,The Positive Reviews must be from Relatives,"I tend to rely on the consumer reviews of products when puchasing something that I'm not familiar with. Well, when I purchased this item - there were only positive reviews. (Since then, I see that there are a couple of others who have my same reaction......) A few songs into this CD, I thought that the folks who gave this a positive review must have something to gain from the sales of this release. It's really not a good CD for children. Yes, she has a somewhat pleasant voice, but this isn't the kind of music that captures a child's attention. It's way too slow, too high pitched, and not at all conducive to singing along. ""Do you know the muffin man?"" sounds like a painful piano bar rendition. I was looking for a good cd to play in the car or at home to sing along with my toddler and have him learn all the classics. This one is really hard to listen to for both of us. I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,Not very Enlightening,"I did not feel like I learned anything about Buddhism from this film. Furthermore, when interviewing people with strong accents it is helpful to use subtitles."
5,MBCBT for Depression,Was really happy with this product. It arrived in excellent condition and very quickly to my address in Australia. Much quicker than other purchases I have made via Amazon. Thanks very much.
1,Weird,I bought this thinking it would awesome and then I popped it in and I don't think I'll ever do that again. It's like listening to a children's storyteller. It's really strange...not worth buying at all.
5,It rings my bells!,"Not as smooth as the soundtrack in recording or casting, yet with a much more spontaneous feel. Not that there are any flaws in the casting, and it is not overproduced in the way I find the soundtrack to be. This is the one to have if you want this musical."
2,"Cute, but....","Secondary triggers are a pain to access. Center button won't access quit menu in Unreal Tournament 3. If it was more ergonomic on the lower buttons, I could deal with the center button problem. Could not recommend this controller."
3,Logitech Chillstream Controller,I recently purchased this controller. The fan helps keep your hands cool when playing. Worth the money.
3,Makari products,"I have been using the soap and night cream for a month now. In all honesty, I've missed 3 nights of not using the night cream. If there's a difference, I don't see it yet. But the soap makes my face feel nice and smooth. I would probably buy the soap again. But not the night cream. The products were delivered very quickly."
5,WONDERFUL BUY,"This is by far one of the best horse related books out there. Not only are there tons of beautiful pictures but its full of so much information, from colors to trainers... great buy! definately worth your money!!!"
3,Memory lane,"This cassette is from the Amway days of the '90's.Great word to live by in "" some will, some won't, so what....next!!!"""
2,More blades doesn't equal better,"I recently purchased this new 4 blade razor. Probably like most men thinking the more the blades the better/closer the shave. I was wrong. The four blade razor is average with light one day stubble, but put it up against a couple days rough stubble and it is almost useless, and this razor is brand new! The 3 blade razor I was using performed much better. I will go back to the 3 blade as soon as I can use up the 16 dollars worth of cartridges I got suckered into buying."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is one of the worst razors I have ever used. The drag on this is horrible, and after only a few uses the pivot on the head didn't work properly. Thankfully, I got this for free so I have no qualms about tossing it in the trash where it belongs. The Mach 3 is clearly superior to this piece of garbage."
1,"""F"" for failure","I signed on the band-wagon of having the newest and most improved. It's new and has 4 Blades!! It must rock the Gillete Mach 3 right?? WRONG. I hate this razor with a passion. The first shave is fairly smooth, I will give it that. But the 4 Blades are for some CRAZY reason Tied Together with a WIRE wrapped around them every 1/6 of an inch. These wires come loose and break after about the third use of one blade. Then the wire starts RIPPING YOUR FACE APART every stroke. Then you have to rip the wire out with pliers, and then, ANOTHER one breaks the next time you shave. Horrible product. With an 8 pack of Blades costing $16 (!!??!!), I can go broke in a month trying to shave with this thing."
2,Callanetics much better,"I was so disappointed in this set. It is not at all relaxing in the way Callanetics is. Also, this shares the same tone as the Lydia Bach book (Awake! Aware! Alive)--don't bother with the Lotte Berk Method unless you are already in shape. All of the people in the DVDs are fit and toned--not a normal person to be seen. Callanetics (which is derived from this) is much more friendly to beginners.Also, this whole thing could have been put out on one DVD with an interactive menu so that you could customize workouts.Buy used."
4,pretty good,"The set of videos includes an introductory, an abs video, a butt video, and a strengthening video. I probably won't do the beginner video again; it's not much of a workout if you're a relatively fit person. I like the specialized ones - they're short enough to be perfect supplemental workouts to your cardio. They're not enough to be a standalone workout. I love the instructors - different for each video, but all cute and peppy."
1,A DVD with a few leg lifts on it - why all the hype??,"These have got to be the worst exercise videos ever. A few high steps, one or two leg lifts, a stretch and - oops, DVD's over. Don't even think about sweating or building any muscle. I made the mistake of buying Hip Hugger Abs and High Round Assets at the same time. What a waste!!!"
4,short workout but lasting results,The lotte berk method is truly powerful. I love the isometric contractions. The only part I thought was weak was the upper body with weights segment. Not many reps to feel any burn. Even using 3 lb dumbells with lots of reps would give a burn. I was hoping for more with this dvd. I love the legs and abdominal segment though. Good cueing and teaching too.
4,This book help me to get start on ISA 2004,"A lot of information cover in this book which could help me to get start and master ISA 2004. However, you need to have the knowledge of 70-290, 70-291 and Exchange server 2003 (70-284). You need to have a lot of stuff to complete this book (PC, server, internet connection, relevant software).The only disaapoint thing of this book is it not include ISA 2004 Enterprise edition for its last chapter.Kanel"
1,Boycott this release,"Please send a message to LucasFilm and boycott this Blu-ray release. George Lucas has destroyed Star Wars with these stupid, unnecessary new changes. Particularly, having Darth Vader scream ""NOOOOOOOO"" not once, but TWICE, as he throws the Emperor down the shaft at the end of Jedi.Ultimately, we get the shaft. If no one buys this mess, than LucasFilm won't make any money off of it. Of course, millions of people will buy this and LucasFilm will make millions. Oh well. Sad days."
1,where is the dvd set,I'm guessing the blue ray set for 69.99 and having the dvd sets on here at out of print 449$ price ranges is a empty scam to get more failing blue rays sold. I'll wait for the dvd Saga set.
1,booo,Really.....why change it? Such a shame. He won't be getting my $$ for this. Although I'm sure he doesn't need it.
1,UNALTERED OT Star Wars fan,"Thanks to modern media, the news of the changes have spread like wildfire. I imagine 20 years ago, many wouldn't have known about these changes until we had bought the set. That $80 can now go to something else more worthy of my money. Maybe I'll buy the blu-ray Blade Runner set, at least THAT director respects his work and his fans to release all versions in one set!"
1,If you want to change something...,... then change Boba Fett not dying in the first few seconds of the fight on the sand barge. What a waste of an iconic character. I was already disappointed by Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of Darth Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi. This is just too much. I will be voting with my wallet. No Star Wars on Blu-Ray for me.
1,Consumer Choice,"I saw Star Wars when it was released in the theaters, many times. I bought the action figures and games, then the VHS tapes, then the LaserDisc, then the DVDs, and then the Special Edition DVDs. I'm drawing the line on the blu-rays because while Lucas is free to change his films as he sees fit, I'm equally free not to buy them if he doesn't give me what I want as a consumer, which is the option to watch them, in blu-ray format, as originally shown in the theaters. I cancelled my Amazon pre-order once I learned that the blu-rays do not contain this option. Maybe, in a weak moment, I'll pick up a set used off of Amazon marketplace, but I'm morally obligated not to add his sales totals."
1,"Never George, Never","I wouldn't buy this even you paid me George Lucas, I have integrity, not the kind you can edit out with a scream in the background either."
1,More changes?!,"Well I had pre-orederd this...until I heard about there being even more changes.These are no longer the movies I loved as a kid. They are new, different, much crappier movies.I still have my original copies of the original versions on VHS. The picture quality isn't good. But at least it's a good movie and not this redesigned BS.At this point Lucas may as well make Alderaan shoot first at the Death Star."
5,Star Wars is great,"Lucas is going to change the Special Editions around. For one, the effects look like crap anymore, he's not going to be happy with that. I also fully expect him to actually add in the deleted scenes, I don't see him just throwing them on a second disk.He often wears a ""Han Shot First"" shirt to conventions... so hopefully he'll fix that. Honestly, if he switches that back and takes out the Jabba's Palace rock scene or whatever, I'll be perfectly fine with the S.E."
2,last straw,"just cancelled my pre order. maybe ill borrow off a friend to see how it looks, but i will no longer contribute to this travesty."
1,phooey on Lucas,Thanks to all the reviews informing me that the blu-ray issue had all these updates. It gave me warning in time so I could cancel my pre-order. If the original theatrical version isn't available then I don't want this set.
1,Don't buy an incomplete boxed set. Wait for more.,"Having finished watching all these in a movie marathon at my friends house, I can safely recommend that no one buy this set. At least not until it's being offered at fire basement sale prices. Episodes I-III are episodes I-III. You already know how you feel about them. Episodes IV-VI are of course the altered versions. Some changes merely annoy, some are passable, and some outright insult the audience. Even if you don't mind the changes you still shouldn't buy the set because it claims to be the ""complete saga"" and yet I can't consider it complete without including the theatrical releases. The extra's are pretty interesting and there is some stuff we haven't seen before, but it's not worth $80 bucks. Wait for Lucas to release the theatrical releases too. He inevitably will."
2,Problems Playing Blu-ray on LG LHB335,Problems Playing Blu-ray on LG LHB335. It seems that every five minutes the movie would stop for a minute and start to fast forward! Also the LG LHB335 has the latest update and there is no more updates for this set for now! These blu-ray movies from Lucas Films are so different and not compatible with both my computer and and player! I thinking of returning the movies back for a refund!Updated; the LG LHB335 now plays Star Wars movies without trouble due to an update. Also I could play Star Wars on my computer but with an updated Cyberlink allow me to play it on my computer! Also the the way it was package lead to finger prints on the disks. I clean them and they played well!
1,NOT the Originals!!! Stay away!,"If I could give this zero stars I would! George has screwed these movies up beyond belief. The product marketing says this set includes ""The Original Trilogy""....what a LIE! These are NOT the original movies. Every change George makes detracts more from the originals. And this isn't just about nostalgia for the originals - these new versions are HORRIBLE not because they are different, but because the changes actually make the movies worse. Vader's ""Noooooo!"" scene has changed one of the most compelling of the series and made it cringe-worthy. STAY AWAY - DO NOT BUY!"
1,"Do it for the fans, not yourself lucas.",do all the changes you want but you should include the originals in blue ray. That way everyone can be happy. Do it for the fans.
1,Do not buy this release,"If you want the original release dont buy this. Dont be a nerd, send the fat man a message. Spend your money on star trek if you have to."
1,Changing the wrong things!,"I will not be spending money on this version after finding out that the rumored NOOOOOO! as Vader throws the emporor over the ledge is true. I will NOT watch one of the best moments of ROTJ be ruined.Changes that should have been made.Han solo shoots firstLimit JarJar scenesedit out C3P0's line ""I'm Beside my self"" and the entire droid head swap fiasco."
1,Ridiculous.,"Just give us the originals! It doesn't work like this, George. Even if the changes were good, I would still want to watch the movies I completely memorized as a kid. What Mr. Lucas is doing to his fans is one of the most atrocious fan treatments I've ever seen."
1,don't support this,"Like many others, I thought the changes were a joke. But they're real. And I don't want to support them."
1,Missing Ingredient,"This blu ray set does not include the Original Theatrical Trilogy, so it is therefore incomplete. Yes, these movies have been remastered in HD, and there are hours of special features, but that is not enough to compensate for the lack of the theatrical versions (the missing ingredient).We have waited patiently for years, and we will continue to do so until the OTT is released. Let this serve as a reminder to you, George Lucas, that you have still not given the fans what we want. And to potential buyers, I suggest you hold on to your $90.00 until the OTT is released on blu ray. Believe me, it will be well worth the wait."
5,Amazing,"This is going to be deleted, but seriously these are movies, how can you people take this so seriously. How can you actually sit in your house at your computer and actually push the keyboard and write these things?"
5,Well-done material but imperfect packaging,The PQ and audio are both superb. One thing I found difficult is to pull the disc out of the package. You need to either bend the disc or the booklet page.
2,no digital copy,"Everyone else seems to be able to include digital copy with bluray or even just dvd, but Jabba the Lucas is gonna soak ya for another $50+ down the road for 'fair play' of something you already purchased the right to view. In fact, I won't buy any dvd that doesn't at least give you the option. Especially decades old recycled 'masterpieces'."
1,Classic Lucas,"The original versions of Episodes IV, V, and VI should have been included on this Blu-Ray release. The fact that these films have been altered is classic Lucas, but these are no longer classic films. It is sad.Like it or not, Lucas, THOSE are the films we love. Admit it, if you got a new Flash Gordon Blu-Ray that collected all the original serials, and there was new audio or new CGI elements that were nothing like what you remembered from your childhood, you'd be pissed. Please, give the fans what they want -- theatrical cuts on Blu-Ray."
1,Fans should Wait,"I am not a star wars fan, but I am tired of Lucas leeching as much money as he can and screwing over the fans who made him rich in the first place. It is well known that these blu-rays are not of the highest possible quality, lack original versions of the first films, and have many other issues which are not acceptable for a blu-ray release of the most popular sci-fi fantasy series ever. I just wanted to let people know that the entire film series will be re-released in theaters in 2012 in 3D. So, most likely, the special edition 3D blu-ray box set which will follow those films will be the one to get. Although that may not be til 2013, I dont think people should let lucas get away with releasing another sub-par product."
2,Why are Laserdiscs STILL the best 'Original Trilogy' versions out today!?!,"What year is this!!!??!!! C'mon, George, my old player's gonna' break someday! Remaster those puppies and slap on DTS, sell them as their own box set and watch them FLY OFF THE SHELVES..."
5,Maravilhoso!!!,"Ótima coleo com resoluo 1080p. Tratamento sonoro nota 10. A qualidade da imagem ficou muito boa, por ser algo to antigo. Só gostaria que o encarte fosse algo mais completo e dedicado a colecionadores... algo com mais conteúdo!"
2,What could've been,"Ok the picture is a lot better on Blu-ray, now we know that GL is going to put all these movies into 3D as he said he wanted it to be. The biggest let down was the fact that they could've put the cut scenes into the movies and they didn't, those idiots. The picture may be better but the cut scenes that weren't in the movies and were instead put on a different disc is total bs to me and waste of money when a lot, or most of us thought that the cut scenes would be put into the movies like they should've been, but we get ripped off again, and makeing me angry isn't a good thing.Maybe $30.00 should've been the price for what we got. We deserved better."
1,Restore the original cuts already!,"George Lucas continues to tinker with his films yet again. Adding even more out-of-place CGI to decades old films and making other unnessecary changes while failing to fix obvious technical flaws... And all of this while continuing to suppress (& allowing to rot away) the original versions of these historic films that started it all. If other classic and much older films like Metropolis and The Wizard of Oz can be restored; and films like Superman 2, Blade Runner, and Close Encounters can have multiple cuts released so veiwers can choose which version to watch, why can't Star Wars? It's time for Lucasfilm to restore & preserve the orginal films that changed history and became an instant legend. This has just gotten ridiculous.If you'd like to know more about the various changes the films have been through, as well as the current state of things, check out savestarwars.com."
1,Han shot first,"Vader shouldn't yell ""Nooooo."" Its revisionism, and within this context, is a big deal, it's as big a deal as Han shooting first. One star to drive the point home - 21st century voting."
1,Sad thing is....,"...even with all the color timing issues, and the horrendous changes to the Vader/Palps/Luke finale, and Obi Wan's drunk homeless man yell...this thing is STILL #1 in pre-orders on Amazon. I'm willing to bet every single one of you who one-starred this monstrosity, this mockery of what's supposed to be Star Wars, will end up buying it at some point in the future. You just can't help yourselves. Lucas does what he wants because he KNOWS after 34 years, he has you all by the balls. Star Wars culture is so ingrained in your minds that no matter what he does, you will still fork over your cash eventually. Eventually he will add in a scene where Palpatine looks directly into the screen, breaks the fourth wall, and says, ""You, like the millions of others, are now...LUCAS'.""And you al will whine. And moan. And complain. And go on a one-star rampage.then you'll pay cold hard cash for another hit of Star Wars. Just one more hit. It's all you need. Buncha junkies. It's sad."
1,NOT BUYING IT!,"I just bought full collection of South Park (season 1 to 14)instead of this. People waited for so long to get their hands on BR release and this is what we get? GTFO!Season SixEpisode:Free Hat - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Tweek journey to George Lucas's house to save Raiders of the Lost Ark from being another victim to movies remade and ruined by their directors."
1,"""You were the Chosen One!""","I'm just as disappointed and disgusted as everyone else wishing for the originals, special features, better transfers, and consideration of the fans. George simply doesn't care about us anymore. It's about the money. He's more machine now than man. His mind is twisted and evil.George, you're breaking my heart."
1,"THIS IS FULL SCREEN, NOT WIDESCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!",Please be warned that you will be getting a version of Star Wars that cuts off the sides of the movie and will miss some of the action. I will be waiting to get the widescreen version. They are not saying this is the full screen version and some people will fall in to the trap as some who are posting.
1,Too Bad...,"I agree with everyone else...that is, it is sad that Lucas felt it necessary to alter the originals so extensively. I hope that, some day, hey will release the original theatrical versions on Blu-ray. Meanwhile, like so many, I cancelled my pre-order almost immediately. Sad, sad, sad."
3,What....Again?,"I don't know about you guys, but this sounds like ""Dinner for Schmucks"" to me. Lucas get richer and the rest of us get dumber. How many times can you release the same movies over and over again? What's next? How about 3D next year.I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had enough!"
1,Another piece of my childhood dies,"I am very glad I haven't bought this box set, having seen them at a friend's I have to admit the production quality is much better than the very disappointing Special Edition DVDs but the change Lucas continues to make to a once beloved mythology, aside from destroying childhood memories also make the story telling worse. Please, please, please take Star Wars away from that meddling pillock."
5,Bring my shuttle!,"I'm sure the picture and sound for these will be top-notch. I've abandoned all hope for a re-release on Blu-ray of the originals. I never really minded the addition of things to the OT, but the modifications were, IMO, generally for the worse. See the title for this review. That being said, I'll buy the full set opening day, and probably start with Empire, and it will be killer."
5,Get over it Geeks!!,"I love Star Wars and I feel the same about the originals too , but the changes are hardly the worse offences ever to movies , I plan on getting these when the money is right , stop nit picking guys its Star Wars :)"
5,best ever,"how could this be anything but the best? not possible. it's the ultimate must have for any star wars fan,"
1,"Why George, why?","The fans who have made you a billionaire, you can't throw us a bone? How about your ""special"" bastardized versions, and the complete un-retouched originals in the box set? Far be it from us lowly fans to recognize some story points you've destroyed with revisions, were perfect the first time. The complete saga isn't really complete if it doesn't contain the originals also in high def. But you don't care. Your ego makes you deaf to what we would like as being irrelevant. Thanks but no thanks Mr. Lucas-you supreme narcissist."
1,It's a trap! Don't buy it!,"Sorry George Lucas, you don't get Mulligans in movies. I wanna see them the way they were in the theater when I was 10, 13, and 16, or at least have the option to view that version. I've already paid you for the VHS versions and the DVD versions. I'm not buying these altered movies!"
1,Not looking forward to it,"I've read many of the reviews on Amazon and on the internet, and it seems like Lucas is shifting the series away from his hardcore base to appeal to the large majority (which is where the money is). To those that don't care about the changes, you're right that it's his prerogative to do this, but that doesn't mean we have to like it (or buy it). I won't be buying this collection and will stick with my DVD's."
1,New Changes to Star Wars Blu Ray.,"If these 'supposed' changes are confirmed I am canceling my pre-order. This is complete BS! I have wanted this box set for years and two weeks before it's release we are literally hearing about changes that should not be in the original films, again we have to deal with tinkering. I for one never minded earlier tweaks and am an unabashed Lucas fan, but I will not buy this set if more silly changes are in fact included."
2,What's wrong with these discs?,"I have just received my second set and it still will not play on my updated blu ray player. Disc 4 stops at 2:23 seconds on both sets I have received. Additionally Disc 2 played oat first but now none will, they all freeze after getting to the main menu. Has anyone else had this problem? My other blu rays from other manufacturers work."
1,Star Wars Blu-ray: EPIC FAIL,"There really isn't too much to say here. With only a 4k transfer rate and a lack of special features...why would I (or you) shell out another $90.00 for a poor reworking of a classic? Furthermore, it is only 5.1 surround sound and not 7.1. In fact, it isn't even the classic episodes 4-6, it is the new versions with too much cgi and Hayden appearing as the ghost of Anakin at the end. Please, do yourself a favor and don't buy this...for yourself, or your kids. IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Wait a year or two when a collector's edition comes out with what everyone is waiting for (like the original edition)."
2,Originals vs. Re-edits,"It's interesting how many shots are being taken at people for expressing the opinion of wantingthe original film versions without the new effects/edits. If Lucas has no intention of releasingthose originals again, the easiest way of showing your disapproval is with your wallet. In pointof fact the original Star Wars was great, Empire was the best one and only about 60% of Returnis watchable. Of the newer trilogy... well watching them is like watching a roadside accident. It'shorrible, disgusting and tragic but you just had to take a look. (Except people like me who don't lookat roadside accidents.)"
5,The best set.,"This is the the best blu-ray set I have ever seen. This set has gotten a lot of bad reviews from people who've never purchased of even rented it. They are all idiots who are just going off internet rumors. This set is beautiful. The picture and sound quality are amazing. The packaging is gorgeous. The extra features are incredible. I thought I knew basically everything about Star Wars, but I've learned a ton of fascinating stuff. I pre-ordered this set, and it came the same day it was available in stores. And I got it for cheaper than anywhere else. This is a fantastic deal. I could not be happier. Buy it. It is your destiny."
3,Is it necessary to move from DVD to Blu Ray?,"Having read some of your reviews I think many of you are reacting to a product that still hasn't been released. So far we have very little tangible information about the picture and sound quality of the films, so we are only speculating what comes from different movie freaks sites.I want to read the reasos why we have to forget about our DVDs and take the next step and move on to the Blu Ray saga.I own lots of Blu-Ray discs from movies that date back as early as the 1920's (Metropolis) and I got to admit that Blu Ray is the next big thing in watching movies so I made this evaluation based on my personal experience: If old movies with B class reputation made it to Blu Ray and were completely enhanced in the shiny HD format, what would it be like having the entire Star Wars saga on blu-ray?If anyone can answer that, be my guest and I'll buy it ASAP."
1,Say It Aint So George,"Stop ripping off fans. If you're selling a Blu-Ray in 2011, it shouldn't be a transfer from 2004. Wait for the real release and just stream this inferior version from Netflix for a few dollars if you need to watch it in the meantime."
1,"Lacks the Theatrical release of episodes 4, 5, and 6.","This release of the Star Wars Saga lacks an important part of the series, the original Theatrical release of the original trilogy.George, please stop messing with a masterpiece. The latest additions to the films make a mockery of what was already a great film."
1,Not another dime,I will not spend another dime on Star Wars merchandise of any kind until the original films are restored and released.
1,"Thanks, but no thanks.","If you spend your hard-earned money on this, then you are a chump. A chump, a sucker, an easy mark. No doubt about it. Take your money and give it to charity instead, it will do more good than this travesty."
1,Like Minka Kelly having surgery to look like Roseanne Barr,"The changes Lucas made to these classic films are a shame. It's like Lucas gave birth to beautiful baby, but refuses to take it outside unless its wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt with affliction underwear on."
1,Join the Revolution!,"I too am joining the boycott of this product. My order has been cancelled. George's greed has gotten the better of his judgement. Granted they are HIS films, but they are a significant part of MY childhood. Tinker with them all that you want as long as you give me the ""original"" version alongside your ""new and improved"" artistic vision."
2,dissipointed,"Unfortunately, I was expecting something a lot better as far as quality..The sound cuts out at various places in all discs.The movies look as if they had been regular DVDs converted to a Blu-Ray format..The actual video quality doesn't seem any better than the original DVDs Each movie starts by having the Twentith Cent. Fox come on in obvious Hi Def, Then it repeats as if they had pused a button, and began the original DVD; Tw CEN FOX label playing again, this time in regular DVD defination..I think we got ripped off..Thanks,Dan Orta, Columbia, SC"
1,Destruction of a classic,"I wanted a pure, unedited, un changed, re release of the original classics. Now, we get this, monstrosity of a release. I guess since Lucas is out of original ideas, he is just going to destroy these."
1,NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"First, just another way to make more money. Next year or two will be the all new-3D versions of the movies on Blu-ray.Second, the continual addition of content: NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYY!Third, instead of continually ""updating"" the filem, its time for a Star Wars re-boot. Justin Bieber as Luke Skywalker!"
1,"Wow, really!? 9 Blu-Ray discs and no original theatrical version!?",How in the world is this being offered by the same man who created this saga? Wow...my old DVDs are becoming worth more and more every day.
1,What's the point if it's not the movie I saw?,"The reason I buy classic movies on video is to relive nostalgia and possibly share that experience with a new generation. The edits to the movies make that impossible. Changing scenes simply makes it a different movie.I'm not upset that Lucas has ""ruined my childhood"" or whatever, these edited releases just mean that the films on the disks aren't the original theatrical releases which for me means there's no point in buying them.Others can nitpick the changes, or philosophize on the nature of cinema. At the end of the day, Lucas has made something I don't want to buy out of something that I otherwise happily would have bought."
1,Lucas has lost it,The prequels are horrible and nothing will change that.The originals are great movies but unfortunately they are not included in this cartoony mockery. Stop changing these films and give us the ones we grew up with. Until then I will not be purchasing.
5,I like it,"I think this is a great set and probably the best box set I own. Most of the changes made to the movies were technical, except for the now infamous change made to ROTJ. And honestly, I watched it and it wasn't that bad. Was it unnecessary? Yes. But it doesn't ruin the film.Now I do believe they need to release a remaster of the original versions, if only for archive purposes, but this set is still a good release."
1,No. Noooooooooooooo!,"The changes being done to this film is a crime against art. Why Lucas feels the need to soil his good films with bizarre alterations to rub his fan's noses in being reminded of his later terrible films, I will never know.I'd rather just watch the good Star Wars movies on VHS."
1,"Another ""Full-Screen"" scam before ""Letterbox"" release","I automatically rate this release as 1-star because of the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen). Lucasfilms pulled the same nonsense when they released the special edition on video back in '97. First they released the ""special edition."" Then, a few months later, they released the special edition in Letterbox (original widescreen) format in 16:9. I will not be buying what Lucasfilms is putting out on Blu-ray this September.I'll be holding out for the Letterbox version, which is sure to come out shortly thereafter. I want to see the whole movie, not the ""full screen"" version with 1/3 of the imagery cropped off from the sides."
1,NOoooooooo,"That should pretty much sum it up. Find the original if you can!! RUN, FLEE! Really sad that adding extra content hurts a film rather than help it like it did for Lord of the Rings."
5,Great Christmas Gift...,To have all the Star Wars movies...how awesome is that! I love having all the movies in one package. The great quility of the picture is worth spending the extra movie for the blu-ray.
1,I will not buy this,I've been duped and disapointed to many times in the past. I have no intrest in purchasing this box set.
1,No Mas!,"Lucas has tinkered with the original trilogy one too many times. This is the last straw and I will not be purchasing this set. The latest changes are absolutely ridiculous. Lucas is so out of touch with the fans who have made him and his family rich. Give the people what they want George, give them the original trilogy in it's ORIGINAL form!"
1,Will Not Buy,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!This is ridiculous. I'm through wasting my money on the versions of Star Wars I do not like. What if Di Vinci altered the Mona Lisa by taking away the famous smirk and replacing with a full blown smile with teeth. It wouldn't be the same. The altered trilogy is a crime against humanity and I wish all Star Wars fans would ban the Blu Ray versions until the ORIGINAL versions are captured in High Def.
1,BOOOOOO,"We want the original theatrical releases !!!!. Damn you George Lucas, DAMN YOU!!!! Why must you ruin everything you touch."
1,Vote with your wallet!,"I loved Star Wars for the bigger part of my life. Not mentioning the unnecessary changes, which are awful, I have seen the quality of these Blu-ray disks. It's abysmal! On top of all that, in an unheard of case of false advertising, Lucasfilm claimed they fixed the glaring errors of the DVD edition, and they did so for A FEW shots, they used to promote the set, and left the rest of the movies as they were in the awful 2004.DVD transfer. Maybe a loss of 30% of detail due to black crush is unimportant to many people. Maybe pink lightsabers do not trouble majority. Some people will not object blue snow and almost black faces of characters on Hoth. Perhaps audio problems can't be perceived by everyone. But this is a problem for me, and I am not paying this time!"
1,STAY AWAY,"The new graphics are TERRIBLE. Instead of restoring the existing scenes, George Lucas has gone through and put in these ridiculous computerizations that are very clearly different from the rest of the scene.DO NOT BUY."
1,memory adjustment,"So, i have never yet made a review, however i must at this time say that when all these people make comments about altering and not being a big deal, this is how i saw it in my own mind. yes, we can accept these changes, move on , deal. but.. what would the world be like if people did this all the time? how would it be if someone went into your mind and changed your memorable christmas morning.. or your memorable first time going to a movie.. or the first time you rode your bike.. its not about how he wants things to be or how they should be, its about how it was..... the way it was presented for the first time for the whole world to see.. as a child i have memories of these movies, memories that made me who i am.. part of me.. you cant just go back and change these things ... its one of the worst crimes of artistic freedom i have ever witnessed. its simply history being slowly rewritten. no matter how minor, there is an old saying.... ""if it's not broke don't fix it"""
3,2 outta 3 ain't bad,New Hope and Empire Strikes Back are classics...Return Of The Jedi (and the prequels) are watered down and weak (unless you're geek).
1,Only Blu-Ray?????,"As good as blu ray format may look, I still appreciate the regular old DVD format, and they look better conformed in my collection of DVDs (as opposed to the short-looking blu ray cases). But I have only heard of this set being released in BR format, and it makes me wonder if they are actually going to release the same set in regular DVD format as well?????"
1,"Support the classic Original Star Wars Trilogy, not these cartoons.","As a fan of the classic era of Star Wars (1977-1996), I can't support a release dedicated to the Cartoon Trilogy produced between 1999-2005 and the Cartoon Editions of the Original Trilogy that were released in 1997 and must be updated every few years because Lucasfilm's animation dates immediately. When the real Original Trilogy is finally released in high-definition on Blu-Ray, I'll be there in a flash."
3,dts audio? ---okay I tried.,"One should spend little time reading this - & move on to other reviews --- This set IS NOT ""Definitive"" --- One may consider the audio?"
2,Changes made up my mind for me...,"I was considering buying this, but the recent word of new changes to the original trilogy (""Nooooo"" anyone?) has got me off the fence. I'm going to stick with my DVDs.I have fond memories of the original trilogy as it used to be. The ""special edition"" changes always kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but I wanted the DVDs anyway so I could share the movies with my kids. And let's face it, whether Lucas wants to change his own movies or not is a little thing that barely has any impact on my overall life satisfaction.Until now. Because the new changes (especially the ""noooooo"" in Return of the Jedi, in what used to be one of my favorite scenes) bug me enough that I get to save $100 (or whatever) by not buying these Blu-rays. Life satisfaction intact, +$100.Why won't Lucasfilm release these with the audio and video corrected, effects cleaned up, but the original substance that we all love unchanged? Seems like a no-brainer to me."
4,Good Product,"great Bluray and was easy for me to find this in America Amazon because I live in Japan I cannot find here the Spanish and french version, so was a good solution for me bot in America without any international problems.Great."
1,These are not the films you are looking for....,"I saw Episodes IV, V, and VI in the theatre when these films were released. This ain't them. George is out of control."
1,Why George Why!!!?!?,"This is the last straw, I think I have 6 or 7 complete copies of Star Wars, I have bought, gotten as gifts over the last 20 years on 3 different formats (Laser Disk, VHS and DVD). I've had enough. The endless changes to the films, the horrible transfer with all the really bad color issues. The oh so lack luster HD transfer, which was not done right to begin with. The lack of promised deleted scenes. I cringe to think what the 3D versions of the films will be. Peter Jackson made 2 versions of each of the rings films, the theatrical and the Special Editions. He released both on blu-ray and did not mess with them after they were in the can. Why can't george just stop and release it as is?I've had enough. I've seen them many times on cable in HD. Why didn't they just used those version? Why make more changes? Why why why?No more of my money for Star Wars movies for you George."
1,Great coasters,"It's bad enough that GL won't give fans the original versions - these Blu Ray discs don't even work! I tried them on a Sony (not exactly a no name or knockoff brand) player updated to the latest firmware. I'm sure they would make great coasters, but I am returning mine."
4,Excellent blu ray collection,"They did a phenomenal job bringing the saga over to blu-ray, and it looks and sounds great. 4/5 instead of 5/5 because I don't like some of the changes. You might ask yourself, why is he giving it a 4/5 and not a 1/5? Well, because I am not about to give a product a 1/5, or an F, over a matter of seconds. The movies are all over 2 hours. People here are giving this collection a one out of five because of SECONDS out of that 2 hours. Regardless of how significant the scenes are in question, to give an entire saga such a drastically lower score simply because of a few moments, means that you are not a trustworthy reviewer. Do you know what a 1/5 really is? What deserves a 1/5? Even movies I HATE I would not give a 1/5, unless they were so bad as to be in a class out of their own. That's a 1/5. Does this collection deserve a 1/5 because of this? Absolutely not."
1,hahahaha... nope.,Great another Star Wars release I can not-buy! Star Wars was ruined by George's stupid meddling over ten years ago. Time to kill the goose.
1,Really...........................................................,"I can't even begin to describe how depressed/upset/angry/confused I was by such a simple inclusion of ""Nooooo!"" to RotJ... It made a masterful/timeless scene feel more like a scene from a Star Trek episode.Bad call George... Stick to partnered directing, producing, and writing. Please."
1,No,"With the changes made to the classic movies all I can think of to say is ""Nooooooo!""For those who don't know what has been changed here is a link"
2,What the...,"...is that box REALLY bearing the artwork for the Complete Saga? If so, it's hideous. If not, it's still hideous. Based on what some folks have already written here on Amazon, I went over to the official site to find the actual specs. That's specs as in aspect ratio, transfer rate, format, languages, etc. And you know what? I couldn't find them. Maybe you'll have better luck searching than I did, but this does not bode well for what these discs will contain. You'd think LucasArts, or any studio, would be trumpeting that these blu-rays are prepared using the highest transfer rate available, that they're new digital ""prints"" taken direct from the masters, that this is the definitive version of each film...unless, of course, they aren't. I sincerely hope I'm wrong but...I've got a bad feeling about this."
1,This product was missing a DVD,Doesn't make it a complete set if Episode IV is missing? DVD's work but I paid for 6 movies and 3 bonus DVD's.
1,Hrrmmph.,"I, like most true fans, am angry that the original films won't be present on this new set. Having said that (Larry David), I will - of course - be caving and purchasing it. Mr. Lucas, you are a thief if there ever was one. Know that with every dollar you amass you tear a little piece from the foundation of your legacy."
1,A shame,"Erasing cinematic history? No thank you. There are enough reviews stating similar points of view, but until the original versions get proper treatment, no thanks."
4,Get real...its Star Wars on BluRay!!!,"OK, look...I'd love to see the original films put to Blu Ray as much as anyone, but if Lucas were GOING to do that, he would have done that already! The bottom line is, this is the Star Wars saga on Blu Ray...I mean come on! There are alternatives in getting the original films on DVD the way they were theatrically released (see eBay on any given day), and if you are like me you probably have every frickin version ever made on every format made, so you are covered. But pass up on the Star Wars BluRay release over some purist wishlist - that's not gonna happen. It deserves at least 4 stars just because regardless of anything else, it's going to be the best HD transfer out there of a great cinematic series."
1,No thanks Lucas,"Quit screwing your fans Lucas, you fat slob. Release an actual theatrical version along with this redux crap you keep putting out, or let someone else can step in and take over."
1,"Please no ""Noooo!""","Talk about adding a cheesiness factor. Look, I'm not saying that it's not what Vader is thinking, but adding things at this point is just wrong. Stop, back off, and give us the originals like we want them."
1,George Lucas continues butchering his American classic,"By now, you're probably aware of the tinkering George Lucas has done with this new set. With one of these new changes (the 'Noooooo' added to the climax of Return of the Jedi) he has destroyed the dramatic impact of one of the most iconic scenes in American film history. This is embarrassing. What a waste of a release. I won't even get into the other changes, because that change is enough for a 1-star review."
1,WAIT!,"You are better off waiting for the next blu-ray set. I have cancelled the pre-order, and would recommend everyone doing the same. It's really pathetic what Lucas is doing. When the 3D versions come out the complete set will be released. Good night."
1,Broken Heart,"Dear Star Wars -I feel like I don't even know you anymore. Can't we just go back to the way things were?Love,Noah"
1,SOMEBODY STOP GEORGE LUCAS!,Its so lame that George Lucas can't leave the original movies alone. The NOOOOO and Obi's call are RIDICULOUS!Starwars is pretty much dead to me.
3,It's Ok,"Obviously, i knew te movies, but i wanted to have all in a unique box, but this in not impressive, por example if we compare with Lord's of the Ring product (sorry for my english)"
1,"Star Wars IV - why is it dated ""1977"" when Lucas completed it in 2011?","Firstly....the cover designs are lame. He couldnt leave the classic poster designs of the period alone.As far as the films are concerned, I wish Lucas would just get on with it and digitize the entire saga with digital characters, voices etc.I have a sneaking suspicion that after the entire world buys yet another format of this film, he will license Criterion to release the ORIGINAL trilogy as it was released back in the 1977-1983. BTW, is it me or is Lucas starting to look like Jabba the Hutt? Where does his multichins end?"
1,Ruination of an Iconic Saga,"My absolute favorite movie of all time, bastardized and destroyed. Lucas has jumped the shark with these ""frankenmovies"". It's over. The original Trilogy is no more."
3,"""Average"" sums it up best","This is right on target: bought this not expecting much (I'm not a big fan of the dummy books). My wife wanted to start 'learning the computer' which translated into Word processing. This book really did serve as a good introduction to Word.Also recommended: For my own use, it wasn't much help. I'm a long time Word power-user. I'd say the best advanced book is 'Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation' (driza) and the best average user book is 'Using Word 2000' (camarada). Good luck!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I wanted info on how to insert data from an Excel spreadsheet into a Word document. The 1/2 page on Excel spreadsheets was absolutely worthless as all it said was to paste/copy, which is not what I wanted to do. After a lot of trial and error I finally figured it out by myself. If you just want the basics I guess the book is OK but for anything advanced it's not very good."
4,Halloween Costume - first grader,"We bought this costume for our son who is in first grade. We received it in a timely manner. It's cute and fits him well. He is thin and fairly tall, so it's a little short on him. It was a good purchase and is a great costume for Halloween!"
2,pretty good,"It's a nice costume and practical since it's all one piece - just pull it up over any warm clothes. The label inside the costume actually says size 5-7, so it's quite big on a normal sized 4-year old. Also the mask is huge and could fit an adult."
3,Plasticy but they work,"Not crazy about the quality, they feel cheap, but they work for what i needed. Under the table storage"
2,MAMAS AND PAPAS,I NORMALLY LOVE MAMAS AND PAPAS PRODUCTS AND I DO LOVE THIS PRODUCT TOO BUT I'M TRULY SORRY I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS NOT WORTH $75.00. IT JUST ISN'T ANYTHING MORE THAN A CUTE GLORIFIED BEANBAG.
4,Great show for real Pearl Jam fans,"This show was awesome, but you really have to love Pearl Jam to appreciate it, because they don't play the big hits like Jeremy, Alive, Black or Daughter. However, they play great songs like Wishlist, Light years or Last kiss wonderfully. I also saw this show and I loved it. It was one of the greatest shows I've seen. They were awesome on stage, maybe because it was the first show of the second part of the tour. They hadn't played in three weeks and it showed. They were on fire! If you are a real Pearl Jam fan, you will love this cd."
3,OK ring.,"I ordered several rings from this seller, but this is my least favorite. The enamel lines are not perfect with the cz lines, if that makes sense. I see runover. Pretty ring though because of the color."
1,Confused why this is different and shorter,Beware each disc in this combo pack only has 10 songs instead of the normal 15. I'm not sure why there is a shorter version. Waste of money...
4,Comfort plus for a razor,"I have both the Gillette Mach 3 Turbo and the Schick Quattro with four blades. No complaints about either razor. However, I have thick stubble on my face and both work. The main difference is the Gillette does the job but I need to go over my shaving area, several times. The Schick will take the beard off on ONE swing of the blades. The Gillette cuts lighter but the Schick cuts closer. If you need to shave once or twice a day, the Schick is the answer to that problem."
5,They are razors. You know razors.,"If you like Quattros (or Cincos or Ochos or whatever they are making now), you know what you're getting here. These last me a long time, so I buy them. Plus, ordering from Amazon and not having to get the weird dude at CVS to unlock the razor case? Even better."
4,Good Razors,Been using this razor for awhile and am very please with it - These refills fit very well and did the job
3,Anne,"very dissappointed with these radios (I bought two sets).....they do not stay charged but about 24 hours, even when not in use and it takes 16 to 24 hours for them to recharge each time. I'm wondering if my batteries are old, even though I just bought the radios. I love the individual recharge cradles as we use the radios only in the house and they can be placed in different rooms. I don't think I would purchase this brand again."
5,A Long Time Fan - Correction,"I had made an earlier review expressing how wonderful Robert Mirabal and Rare Tribal Mob are and how great ""Music From a Painted Cave"" is. Video and CD are a must have. I felt it necessary to post again because I somehow made a huge typing area and rated this piece as a 4 when it is obviously a FIVE all the way. Sorry gang. This piece is so soul touching but still allows room to laugh, and of course you'll want to dance!! You'd be doing yourself a diservice to not give it a try."
3,Not a bad cd,"As tribute albums go, this one is pretty good. But...did you ever hear a Beatles tribute that was anywhere close to being as good as the Beatles? Same goes here. These are decent performances, but frankly I think they lack the alchemy that made the Louvins' vocal performances so amazing. I was happy to see a tribute to the Louvins because they sure did earn it. But why get this cd when you can get the real thing? And there are so many more good songs done by Charlie and Ira than are captured on this cd, that it would be a shame to stop here. Go get some of their own cds, no way you're gonna regret it."
5,Truly wonderful album,"This album has become the one I listen to most often. Each song conveys deep meaning, each of the artists truly were inspired. I listen to EmmyLou Harris, if you like her work(from early to present) or that of Gram Parsons, I think this album will be enjoyable for you"
5,So glad i got it,Every track is worth listening to on both disks. Just hit play and have a wonderful evening all day long.
5,Daniel Lee Martin,"Where has this guy been hiding. The best country CD I have heard in 3 years, easily. There is so much musically, and the emotion that is put into this album is rare today. If you love country or hate it, this is an album you have to have. My hat off to this talented young artist, best of luck and you have a new fan in Canada."
2,Disappointed,We purchased this product for my Mother-in-Law to hang in her window. We followed the instructions that were provided but within a few months of giving it to her the glass started clouding up.
3,Nice little gift,"I haven't filled mine with water ... its actually going to be a Christmas gift. The price is a little too hefty for me to get one for myself. My review so far: Good quality, a bit heavy. You'll have to figure out a good way to hang it from a tope window frame or ceiling. Too heavy/wide for a suction cup on the window. Comes with a thin nylon unattractive string - which might need to be replaced with something stronger once filled with water."
5,Get It,"I have worked with clients just out of the State Hospital, recovering from mental illness. This book was invaluable in giving me a compassionate view of how Narcissism develops, what it means to the person who has it and those around them, and how to help. I was afraid it would be dry and clinical but it was very readable and actually hard to put down. I recommend it for all students of the psyche and those who try to help others. As John Briere says, ""We're all bozos on the same bus"" and this book is written with a humility and understanding that appeals."
4,Works good in Europe too,"I have been using the 700 for about 3 weeks now in Europe. I am in the AF and stationed in Germany. So far so good. We just got back from a trip down to the Alps and did some skiing, happy to report we were never in jeopardy of getting lost. This GPS tracked us right up the the front of the hotel. I really like the Voice navigation and the maps are right on with what I actually expereince on the road. I do agree with prvious posts that a function to use current position as a waypoint/address entry and to also track the current route would be most helpful. Other than that it was right on."
2,First days of the Roadmate 700,"Day 2 of having the Roadmate 700, and unfortnately, I got a bad one. After 15 minutes of having great coverage, the power goes out. It will not stay on, until it cools down for an hour or two.I really believe in this product since two of my friends have the same one, and love it. Hopefully number 2 will be working better, but my road trip planned for tomorrow, will be reliant on maps and compass.When it works, it's a 5 of 5 but until then it only gets two.Loren"
2,"Great when it works, lots of connection problems which shut it down.","This is my second unit. First one broke, now my replacment shuts off everytime I touch it. Meaning I have to wiggle the power connector, hope it comes on, reprogram...often in traffic...and hope it works long enough to get me where I need to go.When it works, terrific, but obviously shoddy workmanship."
3,Magellan 700,Takes time to activate and sometimes leaves you in a lurch by getting disconnected. Often has to be reset.
1,"Had two, both stopped working after a year","This is a terrible product. Bought my first one from Amazon at $700. It started to have clicking sounds and searches would take 10 minutes; this was after 3 months of use. Then it stopped working, sent it back to Magellan for RMA and after 2 months received a new one. The new one after 6 months would not boot up most of the time. I would have to turn-it on and off at least 5 times (which takes about 5 to 10 minutes) for it to boot-up. Then yesterday it just stopped working completely. When it works, its great. But otherwise its junk. Stay away, I will not buy a Magellan product again."
2,Poor quality,"I acquired my RoadMate 700 Vehicle GPS about six months ago and I'm still learning my ways with it.The device works well in most locations but in cities the external antenna is a most, since the reception is quite poor.Other issues experienced are frequent freezes, some requiring to restart the device (Is it running on Windows?) and about a week ago the cradle tab broke. Believe me, I'm not the kind of guy who treats a $1,000 gadget roughly: so be aware... is fragile, quite fragile.In summary I'm not impressed by this device. When I purchased it I was thinking about the Never-Loss system that Hertz cars have, but this device falls far below the one you find in rental cars."
1,"Don't buy Magellan, Buy a Garmin","You never know if the magellan will find the satellite when you turn it on. It can take up to 15 minutes. I turn it off & on trying to cycle it. I've used a Garmin 330, Works perfectly. You'll be throwing your money out the window with mine if you buy a Magellan!"
1,The products is not reliable - DO NOT TRUST !,"I'm very upset with Thales Navigation. I bought my Roadmate 700 in April 2005. After 4 months, it started to show power issues . it was not turning on. Only blinking . but not turning on. And that happened when I was travelling !!!So I decided to send to the Repair Center. After 2 weeks, I receveid the product back ...After 4 months again ... It is showing the same power issues! It is not turning on! I'm sending the product back to the REPAIR Center, thanks god It is still covered by 1-year warranty. But I definitely feel like NEVER doing business with this company again.If you can NOT trust the reliability of a GPS ... you should not buy it! It happened twice with me ! I hope it's not bad luck ..."
1,lousy!,"Afer reading many reviews about how wonderful the roadMate 700 was, I couldn't wait to obtain one. A great big mistake. Apprently it is defective. I can't place an address or location anywhere near my state, much less any other local location. As for help--NONE, not from the company or from Amazon. Look out for Amazon. They actually advertise that returning an item is easy. That is far from the truth. You can't get a rational reply from them on what to do with this defective item. Also if you start corresponding with them about trying to return someting, be prepared to spend about two days on your computer trying to explain anything to them. Easy to return indeed!"
2,dance hits from Miami,"this compilation contains Paris Int'l's best releases, most of which I did not know before purchase. the highlight of the compilation is without doubt Jill's simplistic yet enjoyable & fun Match made up in heaven (the full 8+ minute extended club mix). the other tracks are a so-so collection of dance tracks with disco, R&B; & freestyle influence. some of the better ones are from Celi Bee, Evelyn Thomas & Maga's When push comes to shove.If you are after Jill's Match made up in heaven & similar Miami freestyle tracks, I would recommend you check out Miami Dance Classics vol 1 Jam on me, including Jill's hit plus other gems from Olga (who put out a couple very good freestyle 12""s), Company B's Jam on me, and good material from Promise Circle, Tiger Moon, PSO, GT & the likeable I can't let go from Celi Bee"
1,Disc defective,"Had great expectations because of reviews, but it would not work no matter what we tried (equipment tested)had to repackage, deliver to UPS etc. Not good..."
4,A winner,I really enjoyed this CD--it shows the diverse talents of Los Lobos and provides something a little different for listeners of all ages. Lots of fun.
2,Typical rock/pop that we've heard hundreds of times before,"Lucy Woodward's debut album isn't mildly refreshing or inventive. Actually, it's a clear rip-off of most of today's young, ""hip"" female singer/song-writers like Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne. Lucy is a far better singer than the ones previously mentioned, but the songs on this CD don't do any justice for the talent she does have. The lyrics are as generic as can be and the music is boring and unoriginal. I believe that Ms. Woodward does have talent but she definitely needs better songs!"
2,it's a Ok Album,saw a feature on her on MTV a few weeks back&dug Her Vocal Stylings a bit there but upon hearing the whole album it sounded just like everything else I've heard over the past decade&change.She has a Decent Voice&easy on the eyes but Musically not much really going on.
5,Lucy Rocks!,"This is one of the best CD's by a female artist that I have heard in a while. It's rock mixed with a little pop, which is great! Her voice is so mellow nice. My two favorite songs are ""Dumb Girls"" and ""Standing."""
5,"Great film, but an acquired taste","This film is fantastic. It is my all time favourite film - but it is definitely an acquired taste. It's 6hours, black and white, looks like it was filmed in someone's garage and there is lots of dialogue that you have to follow carefully. Well worth the effort!fascinating representation of a fascinating time in history."
1,Not my kind of cord,It broke with in a few hours. It will not stay in place and the cable covering is really thin.
1,Doesn't fit,"I bought two on the basis of the other reviews and the low price, and both arrived quickly. However, when I opened one and tried to insert it into an Apple TV optical output, it would not lock in place. I tried it again in a Scientific Atlanta cable TV DVR optical output and the same thing happened, it would not lock in place. Rather than try to force it, I returned both for a refund. I've had better fits with Monster and Phillips brand optical cables."
5,Works Great!,"This cable works just like the more expensive ones. I believe the reviewers that have a problem with ""fitment"" were just not pushing it in until it clicked in place. Like any of these cables, you must exert a little pressure to insure the cable is snapped in. Don't waste your cash on those expensive ""Munster"" cables."
5,Digital Fiber Optic Audio cable / Toslink,Product work without problems --- unbelievable price / value.Delivery by reseller was prompt.I can only recommend to anybody.PS: Don forget to remove the little clear plastic covers before attempting to plug in the cable.
2,You get what you pay for and then less!,I bought these cables on Amazon and have to admit that I am sorely disappointed in them. The biggest issue with these is that the cables are flimsy. The sound quality is lacking compared to higher quality TOS Link cables. I would encourage anyone looking for cables like this to spend a little more to get a lot more.
2,Did not fit,"This product did not fit my Vizio products as it was to small to remain connected. I bought a larger size identified through someones review stating it was to big for their unit and purchased it. Rocketfish worked for my Vizio, but as stated I heard others say Rocketfish was to large. Nice thing is a local large box competitor wants $17.99 for 4ft'er so still way ahead with my dual purchase."
1,This stuff is cat poison,My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?
1,Throw up Treats,"I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after. I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty."
1,Causes Vomiting!!!!,"Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before. I've tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce."
1,Vomiting Kitty,"Like many others on here, my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these ""tasty"" treats. She really loves them, however they don't love her back. It took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together. Finally after a google search, I came across these reviews. I stopped giving her the treats and so far, my cat has been vomit free. Buyer beware, this might not happen with every cat, so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly. Back to her ""greenies"" I go!!"
5,platinum,everything about this single says superstar. the artist is really giving his listeners everything they want. for me this album is a must. markus vance is a new superstar.
2,The Best Of Walter Murphy: A Fifth Of Beethoven,"It is ok, but I would prefer the original since all of ""A fifth of Beethoven"" (which we owned in the late 70's) was MUCH better"
1,BEWARE! THIS ITEM RECEIVED AS CD-R !!,"Okay, what's going on here??? I received this item today and it sure as hell looks like a CDR!! The bluish-green tint is definitely on the CD, which is a dead giveaway, and the liner notes on the CD are very generic, with no graphics, and the package was professionally sealed with photo of group on front. What is really usual, whoever ""copied"" this CD transferred the actual catalog number from the HOT PRODUCTIONS catalog, right onto the face of the CD. While the cuts are very classic and worthy, the audio not bad, but I've counted 6 audible skips/jumps from the disc during playback! As bad as I wanted a copy of the BEST OF INGRAM, this is mediocre! PURCHASE WITH CAUTION! YOU, TOO, MAY JUST GET THE CDR!!"
4,"Excellent price, excellent pefformance, debatable quality","While the product works as described - one end did not fit as snug as I would have liked into the back of my CD player. It is possible that this is a issue with my CD player vs. the cable, but regardless, it is certainly worth the price! And certainly nothing a piece of tape couldn't solve. :)"
3,Worked fine.,"Couldn't tell the difference between this and a monster optical cable.... Digital is Digital.. The only thing is that the monster cable looks and feels more solid so it won't get damaged as easily. This cable is very thin, and I could see it getting damaged very easily."
1,Trash,"You get what you pay for, but these do not look like the picture. Connector ends broke off. Very cheap. Threw them away."
1,Keep Looking,"I purchased this as an inexpensive cable to link an AppleTV and my Panasonic flat screen. As usual cheap can end up costing more as the cable would not properly engage with the ports on either device and was of laughably low quality. That said, the seller (""Importer520"") took pains to respond to my negative experience and even offered a refund of the trivial cost of the item which I had not even requested given that return shipping was likely more than the refund amount anyway.It's great to see a Seller wanting to make the customer happy, but this cable is not the bargain it seems for anything but perhaps the most basic setup or for really short-time use."
5,3 FT digital audio cable,"Anyone who purchases one of these at a store like Best Buy is wasting their money. Best Buy is a great store but I had both cables and this one works jsut as well as the $25 one from any store, compared to this $3 one. The cable is thinner than the other one but still performs the exact same."
4,Single fiber cables,"These are single fiber cables, not the high quality, multi fiber ones that cost several times more. These work fine for short distances, but you may loose some sound quality if you try to use the longer ones. I used 2 of these off a splitter to two receivers. The input cable that I used was a multi strand fiber cable. These worked fine for my application."
3,"Works great, fits odd","1. The cable is as described. It works great!2. I do have a small issue with it fitting properly. The optical line appears to protrude too far from the fitting, causing it to need some jiggling in order for it to fit. Not a huge issue, but it's an issue nonetheless."
1,Spend the Money!!!,"Ok, I read countless reviews from buyers and sellers both about different cables. Everyone said Monster cables aren't worth the money, that sound travels just as fast through one as the other...well I'm here to tell ya that's not why buying cheap is a bad idea. This cable doesn't ""Click"" into place, and I read the other reviews that said that, and thought ""so freakin what?""...well, that means your cable doesnt stay in at all. I had to tape it to get it to stay. Its a fundamental flaw in its design. And, since the connection is weak, the sound is weak and crackles in and out often. I'm pretty mad about it give the time and money I've spent on my sound system and this was my last loose end. So, I beg you...don't buy this POS. Yes its 3 cents or whatever plus shipping so its like 4 or 5 bucks, but I'm telling you, go spend the money on something in the $15-$20 range and your stuff will boom."
1,Don't Even Bother!!!,"I purchased 5 of these with one of the multiple Toslink switches. They didn't work for me at all. I tried each one seperately and none of them worked with the switch. Even more frustrating, was the fact that only one out of five work at all with my 5.1 surround sound system. Then I thought, maybe the selector switch was bad. But after purchasing name brand 3ft optical cables from one of the superstores, I found that the switch works great. Problem solved. I threw these things in the trash. I paid about 45 times more for the name brand cables. It was more than worth it. DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!!"
4,does it's job,"Does what it's supposed to do, what more can you expect it to do? It's not like it's something you use in some way."
1,Well....Now I don't have to buy this!,Thanks everyone for ruining the movie for me. That's why they call them MYSTERIES you ninkompoops. Thanks for giving away the entire plot!
2,Good condition but Eastern Economy Edition,"The book arrive in good shape, but I was a little surprised that it was the Eastern Economy Edition. Perhaps this was in the description somewhere, but I was not expecting it."
1,Totally Sucked,"I'm taking a college course and this book really bites. Reading it just leaves me in a daze. He goes on and on about how this method won't work and that method won't work which completely covers up what we need to learn. I'm getting 98.18% in the class on term 8 of 10, but it's not due to this book. Unfortuneatley I'm stuck with the book because it's what the school uses. Find another one."
3,Go get any book by Silberschatz instead,"I'm sorry I have to disagree. This book is sloppy and poorly written. Besides the run on sentences, multiple spelling errors, and ridiculously long and labored explanations, the book is a dead bore. The author violates the one simple rule when writing a definition or explanation...do not use the word as definition. Granted, some chapters and sections are better written than others, however, overall the student who is desperate to comprehend will eventually head to the web in search of a better explanation. Along the way they will find Abraham Silberschatz textbooks and breathe a sigh of relief."
4,top line 80s disco,"This was Eartha's comeback album, and even though it's a cracker it was at least 5 years too late for the marketplace. All the tracks on the original release (there's a couple of later bonus tracks on this release) were written by Morali and Belolo, the men behind Village People (ahem) and the Ritchie Family, and although the sound was souped-up disco it was still out of step with the mainstream of the early 80s, when disco was taboo. Still, ever-perceptive gay clubs jumped on it and Eartha found herself with new fans. A worthy purchase, not least for La Kitt's delicious vocals."
1,Dupped !!!,"Received the Eartha Kitt Case with a blank CD in it. What's worse is I returned it for a replacement and received another blank CD, only this time dirty with drink stains spilled all over it. I returned that one and just gave up. Would love to have the CD though. I see others have had similar experinces with this CD from Amazon.com. My advice is to buy this CD from another source."
2,Yee gads!,"I had this album when I was 13 years old and a raging little Vinnie Barbarino fan. I remember playing the songs ""Let Her In"" and ""Razzamatazz"" over and over. Let's just say these songs haven't held up over the years. Travolta is not a singer. He's more of a chorus student - one that didn't make any of the ensemble groups. We'll give this one a solid 9.5 on the Cringe-O-Meter, just below Clint Holmes' ""Playground in My Mind"". I gave this CD two stars because, well, it IS Travolta and it's fun to see how he paid the bills before ""Saturday Night Fever""."
1,Don't waste your time,This is the first book that I've read in a long time that I couldn't wait to finish. I was expecting a well written book describing coming of age stories for women. Instead I got a elementary look at subjects that should have been interesting. This book made no points and came to no conclusions....I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
4,A Global Lullaby- very nice,"I think I bought this because it had the Bobby McFerrin ""Common Thread"" version from my favorite lullaby CD, ""On A Starry Night"". It was just what I wanted- various artists, so I don't get tired of anyone's voice, and lots of variety in the music. There are swedish and african songs as well as ""All the Pretty Little Horses"". And most important, the music isn't overdone. I can listen to it over and over without wanting to scream- it's just soothing mood music lullabies."
2,Lullaby,"Interesting but I really didn't think it was appropriate bedtime music for my daughter. She actually had nightmares each night that I played it for her at bedtime. However, my mother really enjoyed it."
2,DISAPPOINTED .....,"After reading the reviews about this CD, I ordered it with confidence. With all these positive reviews, I didn't think I would be disappointed . Well, I WAS very disappointed .This CD is NOT a Lullaby CD for infants or toddlers. It is very annoying. I cannot wait to send it backWho is truly writing the reviews??? Friends?? My daughter kept saying "" turn off mommy"" I'm so sorry thatI even thought about purchasing this cd."
4,A Prison Diary 3: Heaven,Riveting is a review with which I agree. It is a complete diagram of the lack of common sense used by humans even at the highest levels of civilized bureaucracy and misuse of power at every level.
5,Knock on Wood - Hottest disco song ever!,".""Knock on wood"" with Amii Stewart!Hottest disco song ever - it still always crowds the disco floors everywhere!Hottest in 1979 - still hottest!*****"

3,NOTE: This is a Car-Charger,"Just so you know, this product connects to the cigarette lighter adapter in your car. It is not a plug-in (to the wall) charger. I bought this item (at such a great price), but now I'm stuck returning it. It is a fine product, if you're looking for a car-charger, though."
2,No Way,"Sanghyuk is the worst character of them all he will do and say anything to get Jujin to be his girlfriend. The lies everyone tells in this movie will start to way on you. Jujin walks through life mourning her dead boyfriend and simply does what everyone wants her to do and Sanghyuk rises to the occassion by almost raping her and making himself sick to the point of death so that she will keep him as a boyfriend and she becomes submissive to him and only him.In reality this girl has no REAL friends everyone see Sanghyuk point of view.No one cares for her feelings or really about her needs and wants except for one person and he is the center of this mini-series. I've watched many korean, Japanese, Bollywood movie etc. For me this is by far the longest,tiresome and downright annoying movie I have ever seen."
1,Bad history,"I picked up a copy of Abbott Fay's book and immediately found a significant error. He says that Willard Libby graduated from Grand Valley High School in 1926. Libby's family left Parachute when he was 5 years old; he attended California schools. Yes, he was born in what was then Grand Valley, but if he'd stayed, he would have had a difficult time obtaining an adequate education in order to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry. If you repeat old canards long enough, they can come to be regarded as true, but they are still lies. He stole this particular lie from Al Look, who also did shoddy research. It might be fun to read, but what's the point?"
3,A comprehensive but fatally flawed compilation!,"This would have been the ultimate Triumph compilation except for the following song selection issues...- ""A World Of Fantasy"" and ""Rock & Roll Machine"" are notably absent. ""American Girls"" is also missing, but I really can't complain since this is a British compilation.- ""Spellbound"" and ""Never Surrender"" are excellent live versions, but I would have preferred the studio versions.Otherwise, the liner notes and mastering/sound quality are spectacular."
3,Very Small,I did not pay attention to the size and was surprised at how small they are. They are still useful though.
5,Fun with Chinese Symbols Stencils,I like the size of these and they are perfect for making your own artwork.
5,Excellent claw hook a good option for Tama expensive clawhooks,"My all TAMA superstar clawhooks were broken. I was completely mad about it and I was looking for a reliable clawhook for my bass drum. I tried the Gibraltar clawhooks, they are strong and reliable but looks pretty ugly and badly assembled. So I tried to figure it out where to find TAMA claw hooks. Due that E-bay has many stores that have TAMA CH, I tried to buy 16 for my bass drum but there were very expensive. Almost $20USD each. So I was looking for in AMAZON and I found this thing. Cheap, beautiful and strong. My bass drum looks amazing and I need 14 MORE!!!! so please AMAZON hurry up to have more in Stock I need more! moooree!!"
2,Overpriced for Material Included,"I am a teacher who is taking advantage of my library background to become a school librarian. As I browsed literature in the field this book was exciting for me. I very much want to continue my literacy instruction in my new position. Unfortunately, I would consider it highly overpriced ($30+) for the content given. Included are 10 basic reading strategies (including KWL charts, prediction skills) that is likely familiar to those who are experienced in the classroom. Beyond that it costs twice as much as books tend to when offering ""cookbook"" lessons for teaching (and I mean no insult by that phrase owning several of these books myself). This book would be helpful to those without a background in teaching, but otherwise is a waste of money."
1,Yuckiest Dana ever made,"This Dana is simply one of the ugliest bratz dolls I've ever seen in my life. Just look at her freaky face, her yucky fashions and her huge lips!!! My little sister may wanna buy this freakin' doll, but not me!!! I'd rather buy the Yasmin or the Fianna!"
5,new bratz characters,"Uh, the DON'T remain a mystery! WHAT?? The new Bratz characters aren't a mystery, because i know almost ALL of them (not their names, tho!)Tess and Nona - Latina TwiinsKiana - Native Americana russian girl with blonde hair (duno her name, tho!)Felica - and african american girl.The two other twiins - they are very pale w/ blue eyes and raven hair. duno their names, tho!and someone else.........SEEE!!!!!!!!! They aren't a mystery, Fulliem!"
2,Not working,"Ugh.. I really, honustly think MGAE didn't put enough facial detail into this doll. She has dark red blush, her eye shadow is too dark for her, and her eye lashes are too long. Also, you can't even see her nose. Whats the point? Also, her hair is too dry, and cruchy. Also, the fashions definetly aren't working out for her (she looks bad in pink; purple is her best color) Overall, i think it is the waste of money. I am not a big Dana fan, but i am a big Bratz fan, and this is a poor excuse for a Bratz doll."
2,"5 stars for Dalai Lama, 1 star for rest of 'smart' persons ego","This is only worth watching for the wisdom and heart of the Dalai Lama. Take a bunch of 'leaders' in different fields who are working in their field and spirituality, bring them all together to accomplish some great process (renaissance) and see it nearly self-destruct. Really, the whole premise that you are going to get 'smart' people together to conference, and then tell the Dalai Lama something he does not already know is preposterous. Every agenda from boycotting China (for the sake of Tibet) to 'I wanna speak to the Dalai Lama' comes up and it's not pretty. This is mostly a pass for sure. Watching nearly any other video on the Dalai Lama would be more worth your time. There is plenty on you tube featuring the Dalai Lama that is better than this. If you want to pay for it you can go hereA Path to Happiness: His Holiness the Dalai LamaYea for Dalai Lama, but check your ego at the door."
2,"Nice shaver, but doesn't work for my face type","I tried this for just one shave at Norelco's demo booth, but it didn't work for my face. I have a skinny, angular face with some concave (dips inward) surfaces around my throat. The three heads do a good job of hugging convex surfaces like cheeks, but it can't get into the tight spots on my face. It also didn't give me a close shave, leaving my neck and cheeks a bit scratchy. It also drew blood on my neck. I've used various Braun electrics for 20 years because the straight blade works better for me. Your mileage may vary."
1,Worst Razor I have own...,"I have shaved with electric razors all my life. When my old Remington shaver's battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor. This was the coolest looking so I got it. Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink. It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor. Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks.. My single blade electric shaver works better. Even with multiple passes it won't give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.It has other design problems. For example you cannot charge the razor unless its on the stand or in its case. The case is VERY bulky to travel with.I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!"
2,No Improvement from older style Norelco,I have been using Norelco shavers for years now. I recently purchased the Artitec 1090 as I was hoping to get the benefits of the new design. What I found is there were no improvements with the shave and it was still hard getting a clean shave around the neck. For the costs it definitely was not worth the upgrade as besides a slick new design the product offers no better shave then the cheaper Norelco's. The shaver was such a huge disappointment I finally switched to a nonelectric razor for the first time in my life.
2,Keep your old one!,"This is the fourth or fifth Norelco I have owned. This new one is not any better than the last one which is 4-5 years old. I don't like having to clean it after each use and it is larger than the previous one. I was looking for something smaller, sharper, better than the previous one. And the price is much higher than other models."
3,Close shave but flimsy feeling,"A little disappointed with the flimsy, light weight feeling of the shaver, more like what you would expect from a much less expensive shaver, not a $279 shaver. This cheap construction does not allow for a balanced handling of the unit, since most of us are used to heavier electric razors. Gives you the sensation that it is all made from plastic...but I must say that it does shave very well, which is precisely its raison d'etre.. So, its your call!"
2,Shaving Failer,"Always loved NORELCO, but this time ""ALL FALL DOWN"" very rough on throat area ,doesn't cut as close unless you go over&over&over. The price for this razor is much too HIGH!"
3,not the perfect shaver,"I have been using Philips/ Norelco shavers for the past 12 years; and for the past 5 years, I have been using the 8894 model. for no good reason, I wanted a change and assumed that the new Philips Norelco 1090 would be more improved than the 8894.I was wrong.These are the highlights of the 1090 in comparison to the 88941. Louder.2. less power; 65 minutes verses 100 minutes3. the shave is not better; practically the 8894 shaves closer.4. Plastic casing; 8894 had a leather travel case.5. Slightly lighter than the 8894.6. All the 10 series, rate the sameBottom line if you have been using the 8894 and want a change; my advice is stick to your old shaver and save the money. If you are buying a new shaver, go for the 7810 instead, as the 8894 is no longer in stock."
3,new norelco,"Have had a few Norelco razors. This sounded great and aesthetic. Do not feel it works as well as my previous one. Great design, fair results"
1,Never Again!,I bought this product for my husband's birthday and he hated it. He said the hair always clogged up inside and then it just didn't shave correctly after that. I'm returning it today for a refund.
3,Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's shaving system,"I recently purchased the Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 men's shaver and I find that the shaver does a good job and it has many nice features. But the trimmer is much to be desired, the head for the shaver blades gets in the way of the trimmer head because the trimmer does not come out far enough so you have a hard time maneuvering the trimmer around and seeing what you are doing.I purchased the shaver from Amazon.com and I thought the price was good compared to other providers.Thank you,Fred"
1,Worst Norelco Shave ever,"I bought this shaver at BB&B; over a year ago and stubbornly used it for all that time. I finally gave up and started using an older motel Norelco again. The older shaver is great. The arcitec, other than its' design is the worst Norelco I've used in close to the fifty (yes 50) years I've used Norelco electric shavers. It's a slow shave. Tricky spots like chin and moustache needed to be gone over and over again to get a decent shave. It doesn't hold whiskers, but lets them fall all over the sink and floor.It does look great, but as I said, that's it. If you want a Norelco buy one of the older models and steer clear of the arcitec."
2,Performance doesn't match it's good looks.,"I've used nothing but Norelco razors since switching to electric from blades nearly 20 years ago. This razor looks impressive, but the shave is subpar. With the original head that came with the razor, I noticed that it seemed a little dull compared to previous models. I started having problems with in-grown hairs due to the shave being more of a tear than a cut on the whiskers.I've replaced the head twice, but both replacements seemed more dull than the original. I'm not sure if the quality of manufacuring went down at the Company, but this razor definately looks better than it performs.I just made the big leap to Braun by purchasing a 790CC. I'm reading mostly great reviews on this razor. It hasn't arrived yet, but I'll know soon enough whether or not it lives up to all the hype."
3,Prefer my SmartTouch 9190XL,"Like another reviewer said, I really wanted to like this shaver. I used it for a couple of weeks and ended up going back to my Norelco 9190XL. I find the 9190XL gives me a smoother shave, a faster shave, has a much better trimmer, can be charged without a cradle, has a larger whisker reservoir, has better ergonomics, and has a better travel case. The Arcitec is definitely cuter, but unfortunately cute doesn't get you very far in shaving."
4,"Best yet, but why so pricey?","I've been a Norelco user for years, needed a new shaver, and was taken by the design of this new model. After reading the reviews, I expected to get my usual ""Norelco shave"" - not as close as when I shave with a straight-blade razor, but the best of the electrics. My skin is too sensitive to shave with a straight-blade razor every day. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the resulting shave was as close as I can get with a straight-blade - without the irritation. The angle of the shaving surface is steeper than the regular model, requiring you to keep your hand and arm higher than might be used to, but I got over that in the first two weeks - and, was happy to change given the quality of the shave. The only thing stopping me from giving this product five stars is the equally steep price. Norelcos are never inexpensive, but this one really pushes the limit!"
3,Disappointing,"Being a Norelco user for the past 20 years, I expected more from this one. The trimmer is absolutely horrible -- the lack of an extension (as in previous models) makes it incredibly difficult to use. The rest is decent, but the high price means more thought from the designers should have gone into this one."
3,Step - by - step inlay banding production,"First impression: A cheap, homemade set of thoughts. (presentation/cover could be better) color pictures of the designs would have been better.Subsequent impression(s): A well thought out and informative method book.Although the book is in black and white only, the diagrams and inlay patterns can be clearly followed and understood. It takes you from the basics of wood selection, terminology and inlay design and building through to the tools needed. This is a very basic book that every novice could use in a concise and understandable way to get started in inlay design. Absolutely no prior knowledge is needed or assumed. This is only to start, but the author make it look so simple that maybe no other book would be needed."
2,Much to Brief,I would call this more of an outline than a Book.The coverage of the subject was very skimpy.There was no real information for the Student to learn flying.It seemed more for the instructor as basic outline.
1,It will drive you crazy,Like the car in the parking lot with over senstive car alarm that continually goes off with many annoying sounds. Compiled with no off button or volume control this toy will soon become your least favorite of your baby's toys.
1,These guys have no musical talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"are these people kidding me, i bought this album on what good words has been said about them. I got it the other day and i was flat out disapointed that it sounds all the same. First 2 songs are cool, but it gets boring at that. the vocals get me pissed off after the first two songs, maybe that's why people get pissed off when they hear this band. Hatebreed is a lot better."
5,I loved this book!,"""Beyond One: Growing a Family Life and Getting a Life"" was a terrific read, and that is saying a lot from a mother of two who has very little time to read anything, let alone a book. I found the book to be a witty and compassionate look at motherhood that left me feeling that I was not alone. Having a second child can seem so isolating at times that it is a real comfort to realize that there are others in your same situation who feel the same love and frustrations towards their children. Not only do I highly recommend this book, I anxiously await the next book Ms. Hull writes!"
4,Shimanchu,"If I close my eyes, I can see the litle shops in Koza. I can smell yaki tori, and taste soki soba... the song leaves me wanting to taste melon soda and hear more Uchinaguchi.Four stars, not five because I have a great love for the traditional sounds of Okinawa. I did, however, find this Dragonfly interpretation very pleasing... very soothing. I would definitely see Dragonfly live if given the opportunity."
3,"Great mastering/sound, but missing key tracks","The idea of a remastered, hits collection with rarities and single mixes from Talk Talk was great, especially after the skimpy ""Natural History"" cd. Unfortunately, this CD is missing ""My Foolish Friend"" and Mirror Man"", to name just two. Why bother with releasing another comp, just to omit crucial tracks? Rip off."
2,Redundantly Pleasing,While many of these songs are available on other collections this is a well put together set. One can be exposed to all facets of this band. While many have dismissed Talk Talk as a synth driven 80s band that followed in the footsteps of others they display some wonderful talent and moods within thier music. A truly original band with thier own unique sound. You can not go wrong with this cd.
5,A Gem,"during the movie ""16 years of alcohol"" i heard blue nile for the first time and we clicked immediately. ""peace at last"", ""tomorrow morning"", ""family life""...all with engaging lyrics (though oft muffled until i listen for the 5,000th time)..the quiet truth and sentimentality of almost-a-lullaby ""family life"" is repeated often though in different musical frameworks like the introspective beginning but fuller, more upbeat, sing along choral ending ""...warm earth, blue sky, desert"" of ""tomorrow morning"". a cd i listen to over and over and it still sounds new."
3,At Least There's Olivia D'Abo in a Wet T-Shirt,"I remember this film chiefly for some disturbing scenes:1. An elderly couple's car being driven off the road by an aggressive truck. The old couple die.2. A wimpy garage mechanic is tortured is his own garage -- and forced to watch one of his beloved cars being vandalized.3. Our young hero's mother is brutally raped (in a nearby laundry room, was it?) while he is forced to listen.All this in the midst of some beautiful Canadian mountains and forests!Not the most pleasant viewing experience -- but I seem to recall Olivia D'Abo in a wet T-shirt, so the end product is not entirely worthless."
5,Lots of Fun - worth tracking down!,"Although I suppose you could enjoy Well Groomed on its own, I'd recommend finding the book, French Relations first. In FR, we meet the wonderful and impossible Tash French. Tash is (alternately) beautiful, ugly, graceful, klutzy, appealing, exasperating - well, you get the picture. In Well Groomed, we find her heading down the aisle with an equally lovable mess of a man. You love him, but you know he's not right for Tash. The book is very, very long, but it flies by. An added benefit of reading FR first is that you truly see the transition as one of the main characters changes from King Rat to Prince Charming (and we come to really believe that he had all that good in him all along - and that's really a feat!) More importantly, you see Tash develop into an assured and confident woman, making the right choices for the right reasons."
4,Holy Music,"I bought this CD for one song, We Are, a powerful anthem that I had been taught by a dear friend. However, every song on this CD is powerful in its own right and has served and nurtured me over time. Sweet Honey is an amazing a cappella musical group that has evolved out of the African American political and historical experience. With Sacred Ground, Sweet Honey focuses on the spiritual dimensions of political and social challenges such as prejudice and poverty. The result for me, is always a sense of renewal and energy that feeds the soul, soothes the heart and harmonizes mind and body. Sacred Ground is an invaluable CD for any one who works with dispirited and often disembodied people. While most ""new age"" music, emphasizes a certain spaciousness, Sacred Ground which has its roots in traditional gospel and folk music argues in favor of groundedness as a source of heartful strength. Its just this side of divine."
3,not representative,"i recently have gotten 'into' the disco biscuits, having seen them a few times and bought/digested their cd's. i think they are a very interesting band, and certainly the wave of the future in terms of the jam-rock scene. let me say that this cd is not representative of their live sound at all, which is why i give it a three. it is a very good cd, if a little monotonous at times, but their live sound is so fiercely apt that i hate to see them depart from it at all. this cd sounds very techno, with few instances of a clear-cut instrument playing. even the drums are often synthesized despite the fact that their drummer is incredible. i would have loved to have heard a few more real songs, and not quite as much experimentation. altogether, however, this cd is undeniably original and fun to listen to. get it, if only because it will stand out in your collection as truly unique. more importantly, though, go buy a ticket and see these guys."
4,This is not a live show,"No, this does not sound like a Disco Biscuits concert. Then again, it's not a live recording; it's a studio album, and it should be enjoyed as such. I think this is a great introduction to Bisco's fusion of jam rock and dance music and would recommend it to anyone interested in either genre. Also, it's just a really good disc without a single weak track. No, it's not a perfect recording, but it's a great start. The Disco Biscuits are one of the most creative improvisational bands working right now. All 3 of their studio albums have had completely different feels, and each gives an indication of the evolution of this band's music. ""They Missed the Perfume"" is a great album and makes me very interested to see where these guys will go next."
3,"Very good, but flawed","After hearing that the Biscuits started delving into trance, I was skeptical at first - but this album has some fantastic moments (as well as one standout track, Home Again). Overall though the album isnt a classic, and lacks consistency. Although their live shows are much more engaging, the album is far from bad, and light years beyond their style on Civilized Area. Hopefully they will be able to translate their new sound better second go round, cause this one shows plenty of promise."
5,Its all about the biscuits,After seeing the Biscuits live a few times i am blown away. The y are by far the most unique band out there. They arrange a jamband like sound with a dj which is very unique. Over the years each cd brings something new. This cd brings a new array to the electronica day of age almost a futuristic voyage. This cd is by far thier best and with its long songs that keep you focused i dont know how u could get sick of it.
5,Storage Block,"This J.A. Henckels Twin 22-Slot Knife Storage Block is the perfect addition for any kitchen. Are you tired of hunting through the drawer to find the knife you want? The Henckels knife storage block is the perfect way to keep your knives in order. The slots are large enough for the knife to easily side in and out of the block. There's space for your meat fork, your sharpening steel and even your bone scissors. This block is easy to clean and has rubber pegs on the bottom to stop it from sliding across the counter when you're inserting or removing items. I wouldn't be with out mine."
5,LOVE!!!!!!,"This is the BEST knife holder ever!!!!!! I use to keep my knives in a drawer, but as my daughter turned 18 mos, she was able to reach in the drawer. I LOVE having my knives on the counter now! Very nice, clean look!"
5,Excellent and large enough,The block is very well made and big enough to hold all of my knives. The slots are well cut and smooth. It is a little large but not too big for your counter top.
5,Regalo-Gift,What can I say about this Artist but that he sings with Gods presence everytime. Great for a Sunday afternoon or anytime that your feeling spiritual yet need some easy listening for the soul
3,HoHoHoHum,"Listening to the first few songs is a pleasure but soon becomes uncomfortable as the guitar drones on and on. Some of the sytles of guitaring used do not fit the songs.This is a great novelty CD, but nothing more than that. I wonder if it would work well in a dentist's office as background music?"
3,Ho Ho Hoey : Complete Collection,Love Gary Hoey but this particular cd is not a favorite but it was pretty good. HO Ho Hoey: Complete Collection
5,The only way to listen to Christmas music,This cd is the only way to get into the holidays . Gary is awesome and i own other cds of his . I will buy more of his music .
4,First Love Never Dies is Da Bomb!,"The CD is alright..but First love never dies is the jam ...one of the best duets ever created...Joanne Gardner has a great voice..too bad she's not too well known...""Gotta get you home with me tonight"" is also a classic...If you love Ballads....Pick THis up"
5,First review ever of a book...I read it in two days!,"So i've read some of the other posts here and some have mentioned it sounds like only doctors are writing about it.. well, i'm not a doctor, i'm real and i have a serious case of arthritis (rheumatoid/reiters) i've got between 50-65% more of a SED rate than any normal human. (rate of inflammation in the blood).anyway - tthis book is focused on diet, thats the POINT. you are what you eat, i'm a bit of a health nut anyway - but as this book points out, you'll find things you eat on a regular basis-and think are healthy(and can in fact be)- are PRO-inflammatory - this keeping inflamation in your body.I chose to eat things to make my body healthy, not let industrial products ruin my chances of working out, swimming, riding my bike again - where as today, i can't. hope this helps, feel free to write me to check on my status...te"
3,inflammation info,"This is not the most organized presentation of inflammation although it has extensive information on the topic.I would have liked to have seen more whole foods recommendations in a book titled ""The Complete Nutritional Program...""I'm more than a little frustrated with suggestions to take supplements rather than good quality food.Overall, I was disappointed and would not recommend this book."
5,"An excellent, insightful book","I have always been a Civil War buff, but in order to ""expand my historical horizons"" I read this book. I had a Great grandfather that fought in the war and I wanted to learn more about it. This book was a wonderful and entertaining book to read. It gives the reader an insight on how the average soldier spent his time during and away from the war. The book focuses on not only the horrors of the war, but it also contains many humerous stories that had me laughing out loud! I sincerely enjoyed this book. Anyone with a curiosity for this time period should read it."
1,Forget this album get the other two,"This album was a complete let down for me, I even tried to like it because his first two album where Fantastic. I could not get into the whole Dave Matthew vibe this album gave out. ug I am so disappointed I'm selling this album. If you want to here great Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire, get oh! the grandeur and thrills but do not, I repeat, DO NOT GET SWIMMING HOUR."
5,Possibly the best Mac Game I have ever played. . .,"First, let me say that I have been with the Macintosh since the late eighties. I always yearned to have access to the best games that my PC friends could play. Then, I happened on Diablo II. I love this game.With this type of game, the person usually tires of it after one time through. Not with D2. I've played it three times completely through with three different characters. I still have more characters to go.I had zero problems installing it on my G4. It wants some hard drive space and memory, but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of a game. Installation was not a problem.If you want a thinking person's game, go elsewhere. This is pretty much a shoot anything that moves type of game and, in my opinion, the best in its class for the Mac. Hands down.In fact, I like it SO much, I'm heading over to buy the expansion pack as soon as I sign off this review. Buy it. If you like fantasy games, you'll love this."
2,Item not as pictured.,"The comb is not as pictured. The ""wide"" side is pictured with 23 teeth, it actually has 30. I bought it because I have thick hair and I need wider teeth to comb through my hair after I wash it. This comb cannot comb through my hair, wet or dry."
3,"Reads dry, interesting but not exciting.","The involvement of the CIA in the Occult is hardly surprising. The secrecy ofsecret organizations seem to breed bizarre solutions to the equally bizarre worldwe live in today. The ex-CIA guy who wrote it maintains that a serious kernel of truthcenters the story. Goes to show you that truth is again stranger than fiction,worth reading but don't expect any rush or thrill."
5,Ancient Tower,This is an awesome CD. The original compositions are masterfully arranged and the performance by the New York Voices is breathtaking. I rank it in the top five CD's I have purchased in the last few years.
5,great clasic electronic dance of the 80's,"This is an exelent collection of Man 2 Man's (mike & paul zone)songs, even though still missing two great songs to complete the best of: ""hottes of the hot"", and ""these boots are made for walking"" featuring Jessica Williams. but for newcomers this is an exelent example of electronic dance music before techno & industrial showed up. I had the chance to see this guys at mexico's ""club de periodistas"" with DJ Patrick Miller, and live were way greater than in studio. R.I.P. Paul Zone."
1,I really don't like this...,"Often the very best of music is a result of synergism: a group of good musicians come together and create something phenomenal. Flash is anti-synergism. One can listen and appreciate the great talent of the individual musicians but collectively it just doesn't work. This two album CD sounds like a collection of ""Yes"" songs that were excluded and cut. I like Peter Banks, I like Tony Kaye, I love Progressive rock. I hate, hate, hate this two album collection!"
4,Not as good!,"I love Staind more than any other band, except Nirvana, and I loved Break the Cycle I lived for that album, but this one, as good as it is, was a disappointment. I waited forever to get this album, and could barely stand school on that tuesday when it came out. When I got it I was so upset. But I guess if I didnt compare it to Break the Cycle, than it is by far one of the greatest albums of all time. Aaron's voice and writing has evolved so I will say that, but it doesnt hit the mark. The songs seem so sugar coated as a opposed to the first three albums. But I would suggest to anyone to get this album and get the other three they are by far the greatest writing ever."
1,Not going to say much....,"I was extremely disappointed by this cd. I'm not going to trash the band because they put out a cd that completely related to me and helped me through some problems (Dysfunction), but this cd is just not my thing. It's too pop rock. But still a great band and I'm glad that aaron found happiness in his life. Just not my thing anymore. I'm just going to pretend they stopped after break the cycle. I"
3,Staind - faded into something new,"Staind's newest cd 14 Shades of Grey, fail to live up to the previous albums of Staind. While being an avid fan of Staind, Staind's newest album is nothing like the previous albums. Dysfunction and Break the Cycle set a standard of heavy guitar riffs and melodic scream attached to the name, 14 shades of grey fails to live up to these previous standards. While still a very beautifully made album, this album is nothing like the previous cds. The first song, price to pay brings back the reminents of Staind in the past, however, from that point on, all ""heaviness"" is lost. Its a great album, but hardcore staind fans will be dissapointed."
1,"Save your money and enjoy ""Break the Cycle","If you're looking for the good old Staind, look again. This CD is full of rock ballads. If slow mushy songs are your thing, this CD might be for you. I can take a few of them, but I like Staind's hard edge, like we have heard on their past CD's. Aside from the singer's distinctive voice, this sounds like a different band. Pretty disappointing, especially since their last CD was so good."
2,Hmmm,Unfortunately i was waiting more of Staind but thats Life. Our expectations are somtetimes more that reality! lol
2,Most boring Album From Staind,"I bought this album thinking that it would be as good as Break the Cycle. I was very disappointed to find out that there would be only one song that was ok and only ok to me which is the last song Intro. This album doesn't catch my attention any. All the songs are the same tempo, very slow. The lyrics are all about the same. No loud guitar riffs or faster pase songs. And as for the DVD, not worth watching. Sorry guys, I'm just not feeling this one."
2,staind?,you know there first two kicked some serious a** this one has two or three good songs so dont waste your money or time dont but it
3,O Brother,"Where is the pain and anguish Aaron! What happened to you guys, are you too old the thrash and bash with the best of them. I hope that the next album returns to the style we know and love about Staind. Dysfunction is my favorite of all their albums, Break the Cycle was OK, but this album needs serious help...OK I do like some of the songs, especially Zoe Jane, what a tribute to your daughter...Congrats. But true Staind lovers want the harsh chords and gut-wrenching lyrics. This is a mixed bag for me...try again!"
4,finally they are back,"i am glad staind are back with an album more like Dysfunction because even though Break the Cycle had good songs it was really freaking annoying to hear ""Its Been Awhile"" every single hour for a year"
1,STAIND...UH HUH..SAME SONG/DANCE,"ARE THEY TRYING TO BE THE LAKERS AND THREE PEAT? I BELIVE THEY WILL FADE SOON, IF YOU BUY ANY OF THEIRPAST CD'S WELL YOUR REALLY BUYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAINIF YOU PUT COLD, STAIND, OR ANY OTHER BAND OUT THERE THAT SOUNDS LOUD AND WHINEY AND I WAS BLINDFOLDED AND YOU ASKED ME TO PICK I CAN SAY ANYONE OF THEM COULD BE STAIND, BREAK THE CYCLE WAS OK BUT DEPRESSING BUT IF YOUR GONNA BUY ONE OF THEIR ALBUMS I SUGGESTTORMENTED""!"
2,14 Shades Of Lame,"I'm a tremendous Staind fan, or I was before I heard ""14 Shades"" all the way through. I was so excited for this album the second I heard ""Price To Play,"" but for those of you who like the heavier side of Staind, you will be displeased. More than 90% of this record consists of songs that sound like variations of ""Fade"" and ""Home,"" both of which are far superior songs. Many of the riffs sound the same after a while and make even the electric version of ""Outside"" sound like a headbanging tune. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good tunes here, and maybe it will grow on me, but I find myself bored with it already, and I only bought it 2 days ago. I have to say, I do like the tribute to the late Alice In Chains singer, aptly titled ""Layne"", but I think I'm gonna go throw Dysfunction on now to remind me that Staind is capable of being amazing."
1,Boring,"Shades of Gray is an appropriate title as this album lacked the passion that previous albums had. I kept waiting for a song that would stand out and capture my attention, but one song just droned into the other. I did not enjoy this album at all and will probably sell it to a used CD store."
1,Run For your Life,"Wow! This album is garbage. It makes me wanna jump out a window it's so bad. Staind was my favorite band until I listened to the new album. There isn't one good song on the entire cd. If you liked Tormented or Dysfunction, then you'll hate this one. This album is total pop. Buy Seether instead, Staind turned into a bunch of sissies."
2,Nicht so gut :(,"I'm sorry to say this, but Blümchen has made a bad song! Although I have not heard the original version, which was done by Queen, I can say that this version is terrible! Only a good purchase if you are a Queen fan."
3,satisfactory,this product seems satisfactory.it took some time for my dogs to getused to the hollow sound it made when they stepped onit. other than that it good.
4,Looks nice,I ordered these to match the color of our cherry/ chestnutty bed. Its quick to assemble but the glue doesnt really hold in the slots. Some of the wood pieces did not fit perfectly onto the set. Seems on the pricey side for the quality. The carpet steps look plush in the pics but they are quite flat. My dog is 7lbs and it is perfect for her. Might be too small for bigger dogs even tho it carries up to 70lbs.
3,Dog Steps,"The steps are certainly more attractive than the plastic type but appear to be higher than a normal step. I am not sure if it is for this reason or something else, but my dog Charley won't go up and down them and it has been about 3 weeks."
5,Out of Time Soundtrack,"I've watched the movie several times and without the brillianceof Graeme Revell's talent in giving his music that touch like being in Florida was the feeling I got of being on an island surrounded by palm trees, beautiful weather and a view only the sun gives when it sets............."
4,Great reference to identify common & less known pet birds,"Covers history of aviculture, caging, taming, & breeding including setting up mixed species aviaries.Tells country of origin, habitat, foods, whether they will sing/talk or both. Also covers how they do in captivity with children and other pets.Very informative for the person trying to decide what pet they want or whether they want to set upbreeding colonies. Something for everyone!"
4,The Wonder of Imagination,"It is not easy to develop a film from a child's point of view...as it has only been done successfully a few times. (See VILLAGE OF DREAMS - a Japanese movie or PETER PAN). Here, a Mongolian boy who lives in one of the remote spots of the earth discovers a white ping pong ball floating down the river; neither he, nor the elders or even Buddhist priests, understand what it is. It floats. It glows when a flashlight is turned upon it. First, it is understood as a treasure of the river spirits. Next it is thought to be an invaluable glowing pearl. When the boy is told this is THE NATIONAL BALL of China, the boy and two other young friends undertake a wild quest to cross the Gobi Desert to return this treasure to Beijing. Of course, it is a mere ping pong ball, and when the young fellow finally understands the triviality of the ball, the magic is gone. So, which is better: human imagination or reality, a beautiful leap of faith or a scrawny truth?"
5,Engineer,Works well hangs on my golf bag. Folds up small and fits nicely out of the way. Cuts even the largest ring diameters well.
2,"OK, but not great","This album is OK, but I would probably hesitate to buy it again. There are a couple of pieces that are done well, but over-all, I felt it was rather amateurish.[It reminds me of what I would expect a ""demo"" to sound like, not a ""finished product.""]"
5,Great buy,"Worked great. Even with the rip-off shipping cost, it was still cheaper than the one at my local Radxx Shxck."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Hi,Just letting future customers about this product. It just goes to say, ""you get what you pay for"". This optic audio cable is poorly made but does work. It does not securely fit into my brand new Sony Bravia TV, I had to put some tape around the edge that you push into the optical port so it wouldn't fall out. It is also loose on the other end that I had connected to my Bose stereo system. Good luck if you do purchase this cable."
3,It's a Cable.,Bought these to back up the connection for my Turtle Beach X41's always good to have extra when it comes to kids and video games.Pro: Seems to work as advertised at the moment and price was right.Con: Shipping takes forever (more than 2 weeks)
4,Good cable,"Cable is good and sturdy and has been working great for my home theatre setup. One con would be that the wire is super thin which makes it feel a little flimsy. I worry that the internal wire does not have that much protection. In any case, the cable does was I need it to do."
4,Works 4 me!!,"The optical cable works great, not loose or anything; package arrived on time! I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Great sound if the connection is right,"I got this cable to connect my TV to my surround sound. It didn't work very well the first time, crackling on loud or low frequency sounds, but I was able to reconnect it and get good audio out of it. It is touchy, but it works well when it has a good connection."
3,Does it's job!,It does what it was supposed to do and was less expensive way to get ti done than what I was told I'd have to do.
3,PCD Fiber audio cable,I bought this cable thinking my stero system would sound better. I could not hear any change in sound quality. Although the price was good sve your money.
5,Good value,Works as advertized much cheaper than at your walk in stereo shop. !! Plug and play. Don't get much easier than that.
3,"Great bargain, works flawlessly","Update to my review below: This cable is great, what is terrible is my cable box. After setting the audio output to Digital, it defaulted back to HDMI and the result was the unimpressive quality I noted before. When I can get the box to stay set to Digital (it has a mind of it's own) the quality is fantastic.Although the ends did 'click' into my Samsung TV and surround sound unit, the connection was still a little loose which worried me at first. Luckily, the volume range was actually reduced so drastically that I ended up going back to my component cables in the end. For the price it's definitely worth a try, but results may vary."
3,changing attitudes,"That is the title of chapter 25. Moyar tries to create the impression that loss of support for the viet cong ipso facto meant increased support for the government of South Vietnam by the peasants in the villages. I don't buy it. The peasants in many areas were fed up with the war and wanted little or nothing to do with either side. They would have been happy to have seen a coalition government that would have stopped the fighting. But the last thing in the world that Thieu would agree to was something like that. In many areas the armed viet forces on both sides reached accomodations. To some this might have looked like the Government of Vietnam was coming out on top but the people in the area knew otherwise. When Diem was in power he brought about much the same situation in the countryside where for several years he with seeming ease rounded up most of the communists, to the point where the Americans believed the communist problem was solved. But it wasn't."
3,Fun but...,I really thought the game was fun but Harry's movements were confusing and I couldn't defeat Quirell for two years. Two years!!! The third game was out by then!
3,More intellectual than Biskinds other work,"Biskind writes about Hollywood like a great screenwriter - keeping the story flowing and building on the insider excitement - at least he does in Easy Riders to Raging Bulls. and Down and Dirty Pictures. Seeing is believing is more of an intellectual dissection of 50's politics with movies as the lab animal. It's fascinating, but not nearly as fun."
1,Blu-Ray Version NOT Available,"If you order the blu-ray of Johnny Maestro 40th Anniv. they send you ""Tower of Power"" 40th Anniv. instead!!!!! I'd rate it 0 stars but can't."
4,EOS Base Unit and Remote Speaker,"I have been very satisfied with the ease and performance of this basic wireless system--enough to have expanded my system with two additional transmitter/amplifiers. The only drawbacks are that the more far-flung transmitters occasionally cut out, which can be annoying to listeners, and the sound quality of the base unit and remote speaker is not terribly high, particularly at higher volume. But in general, it enables users to put decent sound where they want it without any real technical challenges."
3,Excellent Service; not so great product (not the seller's fault),"I oredred the EOS system because I liked the idea of being able to filter sound throughout my home wirelessly. Well, the sound quality wasn't on par in my opinion. It was very fuzzy and the speakers would get staticy on songs with low bass lines. This again was no fault of the seller's. I received excellent customer service, speedy responses and delivery. In the future, I will not purchase electronics via the Internet (based on reviews) unless I have experienced them for myself first."
1,Not delivered,"Like the other reviewer here I ordered some shoes that were never delivered. Don't get me wrong, I was charged alright...just never delivered and when I checked into it the company claimed i had been refunded...just so happens that said refund never hit my account. Hmm...pretty shady. Not to mention the other poster from November still seemingly is missing her shoes. I hope people read these reviews before ordering."
1,Bowling shoes yet to be delivered,"I would love to review the bowling shoes I ordered on 11.3.08, however, Up Your Alley have not delivered them. I am hoping it is an oversight by Up Your Alley and that they will reply to my email regardng the delay of the bowling shoes with expedience because the bowling shoes are gift.I am looking forwarding to reviewing them when they eventually arrive."
1,Vapid from start to finish,"Utterly empty, recycled waste from Ellis's overcoked, melancholic mind. So poor I couldn't even bring myself to read it. Send this man an idea, pleeeeze, he's been eating too many magazines."
1,Don't bother,"Everytime I listen to KMFDM's ""Megalomaniac"", I am reminded of the 2nd half of this book. The lyrics seem to fit in nicely with the nihilism and pointlessness of this pile of rubbage.I will say that Victor is a ""protagonist"" that you can actually feel a shred of sympathy for, which instantly puts him a notch above Patrick Bateman.However, that's not to say that Victor isn't a self absorbed, vain, sociopathic scum bag that you could care less about. In fact, you could care less about him, just not much less.Typical Ellis nonsense that is tough to ignore, but has little to no shock value. If you've read one Ellis book, you know what you are getting into from the onset, and there really aren't many surprises in store for you."
1,It should have been called ... Namedroporama?,"I might have enjoyed this novel if I hadn't had to wade through the piles and piles of name droppings. And hey, if I had a dollar for every time Victor put on a Prada suit, I would be rich. This is my first Bret Easton Ellis and I have to say, I don't think I have the strength to muddle through another. Thanks, but not thanks."
3,"good, disturbing, but good.","I am not going to go over the plot of this book, it's already been done. You can read WHY you should like or dislike a book, or you can read the book yourself and figure it out for yourself.I can tell you this, the book is not as disturbing as ""American Psyco"", it is a harder read(the plot turn in the middle is hard to wrap your brain around for a while) and the sex and torture is graphic and at times-boring (been there with him in other novels). But Victor is a character worth reading about-worth getting to know. The writing at times is fantastic. Ellis can turn a phrase with the best of them.I know that I could not read this without frequent stops to clear my head-but keep picking it up-it's great entertainment."
1,can you give a book negative stars?,"If I only had the energy to find every person even remotely interested in this book, I would beg and plead with them to spare themselves the misery that I just experienced in reading this. It had to be the worst book I have ever read. I think BEE should find some way to pay back all those readers for the hours in their lives they've lost because this painfully annoying ""novel"""
1,Just a lot of name dropping,"I honestly did not finish the book-I only read maybe 50 pages. Every other paragraph was filled with a who's who name drop of the mid 1990's, which may be fine for exemplification of the story, but did little to entertain, especially reading it 10 yrs after it was published. The mixing of chapter parts had the potential to be interesting; I just didn't care enough to continue."
2,our very own Gertrude Stein,"Does any of this matter? It goes on and on and on. You can open it anywhere and read until you're numb and cross-eyed, flip 180 pages, start again. It's all the same. It's all a bit much."
4,"""Frantic and Rivetting""","This book was incredible. I bought this book blind (not recommended by anyone) because I liked the cover. It was great reading. Ellis' writing is hard to follow and the story goes all over the place, but that's just a reflection of the story itself and the characters - everything is nuts. You never really know what's going so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This may be difficult to swallow for readers who like worlds that are orderly and make sense - which this story does not most of the time. It was crazy and I loved it! Ellis' is smart but not intellectual. Can't wait for another great Ellis read."
2,a series of video clips a little bit to long,"Felt like I zapped at the wrong time into series of video clips on a music, fashion, about music and fashion channel watching artificial 'real characters dropping their written lines', clips about making the clips and being pointed to the feeling 'hey, look, you are backstage where the first crew (Ellis) shoots clip after clip'. Every piece, clip, character is loose connected with the other. And: it's a sequel to Ellis former books. To be continued... Anyway, if it's your first reading of Ellis work, you will probably enjoy it."
3,What's is happening???,"I have to say this is one of the most confusing novels I've read to date. I loved American Psycho but have felt all of Ellis' other works just aren't at the same level. Same for this one. I didn't ""get"" what Ellis was trying to tell us. There was no fluidity in the unfolding of the story- half the time I couldn't tell if what was happening was really happening or if it was in Victor's imagination, or another character's imagination, or Ellis' imagination. But the first part of the book was humorous and the ending was a little shocking, in a good way. It was overall pretty interesting if you don't try to make sense of it all."
2,Wasn't he once a brilliant author?,"I have been an avid fan of Ellis Since I read Less than Zero. However, I found Glamorama to be poorly written coming from a man who is usually ahead of the rest. It was confusing and incredibly irritating. Who cared about Victor Ward? Not me. Not by far."
1,Thank God I didn't pay much for it...,"I love literature. I respect books. I only destroy a book because;1.) I feel like the author cheated me, or2.) To keep it from falling into the hands of someone else so desperate for something to read that they'll pick up ANYTHING.This one went directly into the dumpster for both reasons."
2,poor quality,one who is used to the original gopher will notice the diffrence right away in the quality and performance
4,After the Mud -By:Bill Shrout,After the MudBy: Bill ShroutThis book was a great autobiography of a young man in the navy. He shares many experiences or the navy life in this book and gives many details. He includes many facts about the war and the people involved. He shares his feelings and lets the reader know of his previous life before he went into the navy. He relays in the book that he had a very sheltered life and many of the new things that he found while in his navy career. I enjoyed the book very much because or the way he tells you of his experiences throughout his young life. I also recommend this book to any age group and I hope everyone who reads it enjoys it like I have.
3,Memories,"I really appreciated this song when I watched an episode from the TV series, ""Tour of Duty."" It's a fun, high energy song that play in a particular scene in the show where a concert was held for the troops fighting in Vietnam, back at a base camp. Fantastic song!"
3,2 Hit Wonders,Wooly Bully & Little Red Riding Hood makes this album worth buying. Everything else sounds like wool bully. All the other songs not to good.
5,Vivaldi Concerto for Bassoon,"I purchased this CD as a gift for a bassoon player. I have not heard it, but the bassoon player thought it was a good recording, and enjoyed it very much."
2,DRY WACK,"I ordered this dry pack to keep my wallet, phone and key dry while paddling. The pack works but i have to admit it is rather cumbersome and a bit dorky. If you are NOT looking to look or feel cool this is an excellent choice. If you are looking for something less bulky and a bit more sleak... look elsewhere."
1,worst countersinks ever,"Worst set of countersink bits I have ever owned!!!!!! I am a finish carpenter with over 30 years in the trade and these were very dissapointing all the countersinks slip they can not be tightened enough and the allen set screws just round right out. I am going to grind some flat spots on the shank of the bit and buy new set screws and see if I can salvage them if not I guess the bits will go in my big jug and at least I can use them as pilot bits, just take off the countersink rings.The box they came in was a complete joke also looks like it was made in 6th grade shop class. very cheap and flimsy!!!! I usually dont even bother with reweiws because 99 percent of the time I am verry happy with my purchases on Amazon but this one was soooooo bad and dissapointing I had to warn my fellow craftsmen about them. Dont buy them unless you are willing to modify them to work. Thank you all for reading my post and be ware of this set of bits. W.D."
1,piece of #$%&,"I perchased this set not knowing anything about counter sinks, now I know. The pro is I was able to drill some holes before the stop and shaft started to strip out. there is no way to tighten the lock screws enough to stop them from spinning. These are obviously made in China. why can't America make a low price good tool?"
4,Delta Force Land Warrior,"This is a great game that is fun to play. It provides about 10 different missions in a variety of settings and at different times of day so there are daytime and nightime missions. It also has campaigns that are longer and more difficult in some respects.The downside is that the actual instructions on how to play, are not very detailed.For me, it was well worth the money and I look forward to playing it."
3,Warning it has NO subtitles,"I can't speak to the quality of the movie; I got this film recently and sat down to watch it last night. I found that even though this listing says it has subtitles, it does NOT. My Spanish is still very limited so I guess I will have to postpone viewing this film for a later date."
2,choking hazard?,"My five month-old loves this little bee; however, he can get the blue ""wing"" all the way into his mouth. Because of its shape, he has trouble pulling it out and chokes on it. I didn't use it for a long time because it was too heavy for him and it looks like I'll be putting it up again. The choking really scared me."
2,Staples do not match description,"These are not the staples I thought I was ordering. These are T-50 staples for a spring loaded staple gun.To me, ""narrow crown"" are ""narrow"" for a pneumatic ""narrow crown"" staple guns."
5,"""Safely Home"" will shake up your world.","""Safely Home"" has to be one of the most inspirational, revealing and personally challenging books I have ever read. If you have any heart for missions or the sufferings of others you will not be able to get through the last chapters with out shedding real tears and wanting to pray out loud. Get it...read it...change your life!"
5,THIS BOOK IS A MUST BUY!!,"I admired Li Quan's faith. His faith shone brighter than the sun. His dearest friend Ben Fielding was shocked. He was expecting a to see a successful writer and teacher, instead, his friend teaching the word of Yesu and living in what could be termed `poverty'. Ben could not understand Quan's true happiness.I admired how Li Quan stood faithful throughout his fiery trail. I have to admit that I would have folded.I admired most of all, his trust in Yesu NOT DELIVERING HIM, but to know Yesu would never leave him or forsake him.When you read the book for yourself, ask yourself what would you truly do??"
4,Excellent book but at some points it was a little cheesy,"I loved this book, don't get me wrong! I cried at least through 1/4 of the book. It's touching and moving for any Christian, especially those with a heart for China. However, at some points, I felt like the story was a little unrealistic and a bit cheesy."
4,The Best of the Series,"Of all the Animorphs books and ""Chronicle"" spin-offs, The Hork-Bajir Chronicles was my favorite. By this point in the series, Applegate had established the alien races well enough that we didn't need a whole ton of background info on them, so she was able to tell this story quick and clean. I must have read this book a dozen times that first year that it came out.One thing that impressed me was her ability to shift between various first-person perspectives, giving each character a unique voice. It's told from the POV of a Hork-Bajir ""seer,"" an Andalite princess who teaches her about alien races, and a Yeerk controller who oversaw the infestation of the Hork-Bajir race as warriors. (That Yeerk would eventually become Visser Three, the primary antagonist of the Animorphs series.)Ultimately tragic with an optimistic epilogue, this one was by far the most emotionally captivating story in the Animorphs lineup. I should buy another copy."
5,This book is great,I was amazed by this book. It taught me alot about Hork-Baijr. You should read this book if you want to learn more about Hork-Baijr
4,Well narrated and fun to read!!!,"The Hork Bajir Chronicles is a varied and well explained story. This book is all about Aldrea(Andalite), Dak Hamee(Hork Bajir seer). The Yeerk war with the Hork Bajir is a bit boring. It is readable only for extreme Animorph fans. The prologue and epilogue are quite touching. This is definitely not a must read for Animorph fans, since the only person we know is Esplin 9466 who is now Visser Three.It is not a bad buy though!"
1,Stinks,This book has no plot. After I read this book I felt like I had no reason to live. Whoever wrote this book doesn't know anything.
5,A great book for everybody (needs a better ending though),"A darn good book; it has a greatness in every aspect that I think a book should have. I'm an avid reader of the animorph sieries and this is a classic. It starts out as Andria(an Andilite) talking for a couple of chapters then goes to Dak Hamee(a Hork-Bajir seer) then the yeerk who later becomes Visser Three. The story take place mainly on the Hork-Bajir home world and telling the story of the Hork-Bajir enslavement by the newly born,but great Yeerk Empire.P.S: Please say my review was helpful!"
4,short but sweet,"This short documentary is a little shy of 30 minutes long. But there is a lot of information packed into such a short space of time. This film details the discovery and contents of the tomb of Tutankhamen, perhaps the most famous of the Egyptian pharaohs. The film covers the details of the find, and discusses the way in which the tomb was laid out. Most impressive, however, are the beautiful shots of the tomb, of the three gold sarcophagi, and of the various other adornments which were found along with the mummy. This is a great documentary about Egypt, and a good use of a half-hour."
1,Pool First Aid,This product did virtually nothing to remove algae from pool. After treating as instructed still had to shock and scrub to remove. Will not purchase again.
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,"I had a very cloudy,almost milk like color for pool water that i could not remedy. After numerous trips to the local pool store and $150 later the pool water was still cloudy.I saw this stuff on Amazon and took one final shot before flocking the pool, which is a real pain according to the guy at the pool store.Well let me tell you this stuff works.After just 24 hours of using it the pool is clearing up and i can actually see the bottom of the pool again.I will probably do a second dose just to be sure.This product is truly FANTASTIC....."
4,Delighted to own this disco classic jam!,"I remember back in the 70's when ""LET's GET IT TOGETHER"" and ""COCOMOTION"" was the JAM!!You couldn't resist doing the hustle when ""COCOMOTION"" was playing.I never grow tired of this song with it's feel good fast tempo beats and violins.""LGIT"" is at a slower pace with it's sexy,raw yet sophisticated clarinets playing.""MONDO CIRCUS"" the last track on this CD is okay(I can do without it).This CD is ""SO HOT"" that strangers stop me in the street to find out where I purchased it.El CoCo is a cherished disco collection and in my opinion ""EL COCO is still JAMMING""!!!"
1,Won't work,Won't install under Windows XP. Just gives a cryptic message. I should know better than buy Cosmi
5,fantastic,"Forget Death Cult Armageddon, buy this. Everything OMC does is awesome, and this is no exception. Just the right mix of atmosphere and heaviness."
5,KICK ASS,"PURELY AN AMAZING BLACK METAL CD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE""BLACK SEEDS ON VIRGIN SOIL"" ""SACRIFICE OF VENGENCE"" ""THE SOUL DECEIVER"" AND ""FELONIES OF THE CHRISTAIN ART."" ITS GREAT."
5,Old Man's Child returns to the metal scene again,"""In Defiance Of Existance"" is a great damn CD!I've only had it for about a week, but it's been the only thing in my stereo and / or CD player since.Anyone that already has or is going to get an Old Man's Child CD should DEFINITELY pick this one up!You can probably find it in Gallery of Sound, FYE, and other stores of that nature.Congrats to OMC for a fifth album well done!!"
4,the best in underground reggae,"if you want real underground from the island of puerto rico i encourage you to get this and other volumes of the noise. is pure ""underground"" rap and reggae by some of the best rappers. if you buy one ...you'll want more. Esto es pura Melaza gente. upbeat , ritmo contagioso,liricas bien ingeniosas... y una que otra tiraita a otros raperos"
3,"Long, and Confusing","After two hours I have no more of a clue as to why this woman left. In the flashbacks we see that the woman and her husband had a good relationship at one time. What teenager hasn't called a parent stupid? What wife or husband hasn't at one point in the relatioship felt left out? These are normal problems that normal people can work out if they just reach out. Walking out is not the answer. I would give this film a 1 1/2 or 2 except that Angus MacFaden turns out a wonderful performance showing what a terific and under used actor he is. He plays the part of a caring father beautifully and one can see why a woman would feel comfortable leaving her children in his care. If you feel you must buy this film shop around for a previously viewed copy at Blockbuster or Hollywoodvideo so, you don't feel cheated and fast forward through the first hour- you won't miss anything and, if you feel lost the previous hour will not clue you in anymore."
1,Nevada isn't worth watching,"Nevada is essentially a movie about a selfish woman who abrogates her responsibility to her family. The ending sees her throwing away husband and children who have done nothing wrong. She gets itchy feet because of routine life. Life isn't fair, you don't always get what you want. If you bring children into the world you owe them the love and time to see them into adulthood. Otherwise they'll be as flakey as Chrysty."
1,big problem,"I have mixed feelings about this video. It IS funny and entertaining. However, the professor uses humor at the expense of truth. There are 26 ""sounds"" and 3 ""vowels"" in English? Baloney. Also, some of his ""history"" gets a prize for humor and a zero for truth. I showed this in an upper division course on Germanic phonetics and history and spent the rest of the hour correcting the information my students had just heard. I'd have to categorize ""A Light History of the English Language"" as academic infotainment. It's the ""National Enquirer"" of scholarship."
2,a garden series?,"This is supposed to be a garden series. What an unusual gardener Peggy Lee is. Her ""bulb garden"" has ""dinner plate ASTERS"" blooming there in August! Really--I somehow think the plants are DAHLIAS which a. grow from tubers and b. are often described as ""dinner plate."" In fact, I have never heard of a dinner plate aster. I also don't think asters would do well in a southern garden in August.Of course, I know very little about stock car racing.Please, let someone who knows a subject read the manuscript before rushing it into print."
3,Basic hacksaw,"Klein makes great tools, my complaint is the extra blade holder doesnt work too well the piece of foam they give you to keep the blades from falling out gets lost real easy."
2,"Not bad, but not really what was advertised.","I received these balls today and they were shipped quickly and on time. Most of the balls are in pretty good condition with only a few (6) discoloured or roughed up. The main reason for my disappointment is that 10 of the 36 ball were the older HX Bite and not the HX Hot Bite I was promised. You may think I am being pedantic, but the reason I bought these was because I knew the Hot Bites were relatively new and would be more likely to be in a good condition. My fears were confirmed when I looked at the HX bites and discovered that all of the discoloured balls or rough edged balls were in fact the HX bites and not the HX Hot Bites, which were in far better condition. I still think these are a pretty good deal for the price, I just don't like being sold something different from that which is advertised, especially if it means the quality of the product is lowered."
5,My favorite of the Matthew Scudder books.,"Lawrence Block is the best. While this book about the drinkinglife may be light on plot, it captures the slowly unfolding, unbearable sadnessof Matthew Scudder's life even better than any of theother Matthew Scudder mysteries."
4,Best Scudder I have read,"Although I have not read the entire Scudder series this particular book has always stuck with me, far more than any of the others. In fact, I sort of abandoned the series because none of Block's subsequent books really lived up to this one. The mystery elements of the story are minimal, rather the emphasis is on milieu. Block gets certain scenes, especially those dealing with alcohol and the rationalizations people make, just perfect. The end is also a fine wrapup for this story - definitely a worthwhile read."
5,Must Watch TV,Season 2 packed as much of a punch as season one with a little more spice! A great show to watch!
4,Episode and product review,The episode is one of a group leading to the summer finale and a real treat to watch. Dani at the Swingers party is especially funny. The video delivers quickly and cleanly to my laptop and is easily watched more than once.
5,"Great movie, enjoyed it very much","This was a great movie, we watched it not really knowing what to expect, but were plesenty suprized, should have known, with Morgan staring. He is a great actor."
4,Fun Movie - Great Ending,"I'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. I have enjoyed nearly all of his movies. This one is no exception. Morgan does a good job of portraying a grumpy old, recently disabled, writer of western fiction, who is basically forced to move to a somewhat secluded town. His neighbors are a single mother, and her daughters, one of which attempts to befriend Morgan, and eventually suceeds. It is a fun movie, with a slight twist at the very end that gives you an extra boost."
5,"Morgan as usual, great","Uplifting, heart warming and interesting. Morgan Freeman lays out another one of the performances we come to expect from the master, enough said."
1,NO!,Morgan Freeman is my all time favorite actor but this movie is AWFUL. Almost like he just needed to do it to pick up some extra cash lol
2,Corny and Predictable,"This movie must be one Morgan Freeman did as a favor for Reiner. This rivals a Lifetime movie. We were waiting for Robert Urich to appear, maybe he did, we turned it off before it finished. Very surprised it was that bad."
2,How is this rated PG?!?!,"The profanity in this starts from the first 10 minutes, including and not limited to using the Lord's name in vane TWICEo (nce by a child). I would not suggest allowing children under 13 to watch it.It moved slowly. You might want to watch it if you want to fall asleep."
4,Actual magic does take place!,An extraordinary human comes to Be again with himself after having lost his spark for life. It all happens in a uniquely sublime well crafted movie that you have some reservations about for maybe the first 5 minutes. But it does not relent in a deep dive into quality relations that rarely happen but that we all wish we stepped up to the plate for.I am embarrassed to admit I seem to have become a sappy watery squash bucketever since the birth of my now 5.4 yr old son - but I have not lost my mind and this film has enough mind in it to pull you in and land you on a piece of smooth glassy lake water.
3,Not sure,I started watching this and I'm not sure if it was too slow or I was too tired.....I fell asleep.
3,The Magic of Bell Isle,"The start seemed slow.It was more drama than romance, with a bit of humor thrown in here and there."
4,Engaging and touching,"The basic plot is not very original, but the story is engaging and very entertaining. Basically, an alcoholic and handicapped author (Freeman) gets a new outlook on life from his new neighbor (Madsen) and her daughters. Morgan Freeman is superb, as always. Virginia Madsen is sublime. There is wit and pathos intermixed with excellent dialogue and a very lovely storyline. Well worth owning."
2,Mostly a sappy corny turd of a movie,It may have been because I watched this on a plane with edits but this was pretty bad. Freeman does a good job but this is a bad CBS after school special. Stay away unless you really like corny dialogue.
5,Unexpected joy,"I always like Morgan Freeman, I was just going to check this movie, but I could not stop watching it."
4,great family movie with a moral to the story!,"believable story we can all relate to with a happy ending.Come on Hollywood, start producing more movies like this."
4,Beautiful Dish,"This is a beautiful butter dish. Unfortunately it is not deep enough to contain a stick of butter. Either the stick has to be sliced lengthwise to reduce its height or the lid of the butter dish rests on the stick of butter instead of nesting into the base. Maybe a stick of margarine will fit but I didn't buy it for margarine. I bought a ""Handcut Crystal Rectangular Butter Dish"" with ""Butter"" being the operative word."
5,Self sufficiency in a Peak Oil world,"In a world of rapidly growing population and dwindling resources, this film offers hope. Modern agriculture is the process of turning petroleum into food via fertilisers, pesticides and the use of powerful tractors. But as oil and gas production begins to decline, and soils become exhausted, the world faces an imminent food crisis. The recent oil spikes and food price inflation of 2008 herald the disaster to come. However, Peter Proctor shows how soils can be rebuilt and crop yields boosted again by bio-dynamic methods that begin with composting based on cow manure. One farmer at at time, he is rebuilding the food production capacity of India, with a view to spreading the methods world-wide. But time is short. This could be the most important film you ever see. An inspirational film for all interested in Organic food, Environmentalism, Peak Oil and Self-Sufficency."
5,At Peace With Nature,"This is a very inspiring and interesting film.Visually appealing and well produced, it takes the viewer on a tour of a number of farms in India and looks at their transformation since they adopted bio-dynamic farming methods. It shows how farming could be, and indeed is being, transformed by ending the 'war on nature' engaged in by agri-business and making peace with nature.It shows how bio-dynamics is the rediscovery of ancient rythmns and that the world has the potential to not only feed itself but become more healthy in the process.Another world is not only possible but is happening already."
5,Muzik Mann,"I was introduced to Nake Music, and Miguel Migs while visiting Virgin Records and couldn't stop feel good about the music that was playing. When I asked the clerk who's CD they were he showed me and I quickly bought it and the previous volume and have been hooked ever since. If you want to enjoy something silky smooth with a swirling sexy vibe on top of that this CD won't dissapoint you.Other music CD's similar to this that I would also recommend: The Best of Nake Music-Bare Essentials Vol 2, Miguel Migs-Colorful You, Blue Six-Beautiful Tomorrow, Miguel Migs-Nude Tempo, Nude Dimensions, Nude Dimensions Vol 3 and OM Records-The United Nations of Future Music Vol 1. If you like sexy, loungy-house music without too much electronica, this collection of music is for you.This CD and the others can best be described as an eclectic mix of deep-housey, soulful, sultry, ambient, laid back, seductive, sublime groove, with sexy down-tempo beats to to tickle your neurons."
3,Useful yet annoying,"As advertised by the title, this book describes how to use ArcInfo 8.0. However, the number of wasted words and useless images kept me from enjoying it much. The book describes, in some detail, the three new modules of ArcInfo and gives a cursory overview of the old ones. The descriptions are sullied by descriptions of things that are too basic for someone trying to use a $10,000 piece of software (for example, What is a wizard?) by hyperbole (for example, ""You will find this feature indispensable"" - really?) and by poor page layout. Overall, I'm glad to have the book, but I was hoping for a higher quality product..."
2,Game had an unfinished quality...,"I'm at a lull in between playing the newer releases, and decided to pick up Lionheart on a whim. Even at a fraction of the original cost, I found this game virtually unplayable. While the premise is original, I found the subject matter distasteful (too much focus on the inquisition), and the graphics tiny, outdated, and the character avatars really, really ugly.The game had an unfinished quality, and I found the combat at the beginning way too hard. Entering into dungeons my character was immediately mauled and killed. There is almost no tutorial, and no learning curve for new players, and hardly any place to get money or weapons.Also I chose and built a female character, I was surprised to discover that her voiceset sounded very male! Err....I'll have to give this game 2 stars. The game had promise, but needed about another year of development. Black Isle has produced better."
5,Animal hospital for kids who have pets,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my godchild who will turn 4 in March. She is very interested in animals and has already expressed a desire to be a vet. Admittedly I am a little biased but I think she is a very intelligent child and she loves the animal hospital. She had to get every piece out and examine it immediately upon opening it. I think this would be a very good experience for any child who is interested in animals. It allows them to see some of the instuments that a vet would use and they can set up their own little office. This is not to be used to treat real, live animals though. There are lots of pieces in the set so if you have a child who gets frustrated easily or has trouble keeping track of lots of pieces, this probably would not be a good selection for them."
2,Only tried yahtzee and there are much better out there,Acceptable version of yahtzee. All game features there BUT adds nothing to utilize computer.Minimal graphics and not even high scores...Other games looked OK but not terribly exciting for anyone over 6.For yahtzee--try Encore or 1 of vendors online--their Yahtzee is terrific and best out there..
3,Not bad but some parts could use more detail,The book it's o.k. but for some parts of the book some going into the signals could use some more explaining
1,One of the worst written college books ever.,"Having had to suffer through 1 semester of this book, I was horrified to learn that my school had decided to keep this book for the second semester of signals! This is book would be much better as a hyperlinked document, because the author continuously references other chapters and formula #'s. His examples are confusing, and leave you wondering what you are looking for. A visist to the book's website leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Honestly, if you need this book, find another book to use as a reference because you will need it."
2,A bad book,"I've had a class with the author of this book and found the book to be hard to follow, vague, and almost impossible to read. Unfortunately this might be the best book on this subject."
5,Son loves this,"My son loved this cup, it was just the right size for his little hands. The little compartment on the bottom to add a snack was a neat plus."
4,It swings...it rocks...,"I bought this CD solely on listening to it in Borders Music and Books. The Amazing Royal Crowns are a truly enjoyable fusion of rockabilly, punk, and swing...if you are into the new swing revival thing, you will not be disappointed. I really only have one complaint: a lot of the songs sound the same."
3,This is a book to rent from a library.,"I am a huge Paul Zindel fan, I have 4 of his books and just ordered 2 more, so BELIEVE ME, I know alot about his books. But something about this book just didn't work. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, it just doesn't have that ""kick"" to it. Zindel did a great job with the plot, he just didn't put in enough POWER in it.He deserves recognition for his book, but there is still a little work to be done.In conclusion, I really reccommend this book, but in turn, I wouldn't spend my money on it if I were you."
4,A boy tries to hide Loch Ness monsters.,"A teen, (nicknamed Loch after he saw 'something' at Loch Ness) discovers thetrue nature of these animals as he hides them from his dad's boss, (who want'sthem for the money)He eventualy helps them escape from theGreat Lakes. The fierce father of these creatures attackspeople while attemps are made to capture him."
5,This is the Best of the Loch Ness!,Read this book if you like loch ness monsters also if you like violent creatures biting people.
1,Not worth buying,These bookmarks are pretty but made of heavy paper. If you waste any type of liquid on them you will have to throw them away. If you prefer a sturdy bookmark do not buy this product.
2,Mayfair Games' Sentinels redone...,"This is basically a weaker rewrite of Mayfair Games' Sentinels product, which TSR won in their lawsuit against the third-party developer several years back. Forced into the basic AD&D Cosmology, this product still borrows in spirit from the original source. As a fan of MFG's Role-aids product line, I appreciated the effort, but it was not nearly as well done as Shaman, Chronomancer, or the latest, the Guide to Hell. Still, it does introduce some good possibilities for a Planescape game, and as such, a creative DM can use this product as a springboard for greater adventure possibilities later. But still, I'd recommend the old MFG Sentinels and Demons supplements, if you can find them."
3,Long Period Covered in Short Space,"This is a very interesting book but a little wordy. I was looking up every other word in the dictionary. And the chapters of the book were not that well connected and did not flow smoothly. One minute you'd be reading about the French and in the next the Americans. The highlights were the last chapters, which dealt with US ships bombarding various spice islands."
2,Dr Sprinkle needs an editor,"I have tried to read this book multiple times, but cannot read it because of the way it was written. There are way too many broken segments within the chapters. It feels as though it rambles on and on with little direction. Each paragraph has its own heading!!! I also don't like getting sex advice from a former porn star. Although I am sure that she is an expert at sex, I am not so sure that my wife and I could relate to everything in the book. We are definitey not the type to take a sex class.The book may contain great information, but the difficulty in reading the book was the reason for the low star rating. I am not sure who else edited this book, but they probably know Dr Sprinkle personally."
3,3.5 from 1/2 of the Artifacts,"Tame One finally hits us off with an LP and was it worth the wait? Kind of. This was a preety dope LP featuring production from RJD2, J-Zone, Mighty Mi and Camu-Tao and Tame came off HARD. This album hit much harder than El da Sensei's ""Relax, Relate, Release,"" but honestly I liked El's LP better. (that's just my opinion)When I first put the CD in the deck I couldn't tell it was Tame One at first. His voice got grimey and it'd been so long since he released anything that I almost couldn't tell it was him. After a few cuts into the LP you realize it's Tame, just a little older, but hungrier than ever. Battle rhymes and beat downs are delivered throughout this LP leaving ""weak emcees"" in the dust.This album was preety solid, but I had higher expectations due to El's album and because of how long it took Tame to release this. All in all it was worth the cash I gave Sandbox."
1,broke within 1 week,Not what I expected this to be. Broke within 1 week of getting the product. thankfully i was refunded the amount eventually.
3,A unique band you may or may not like,"It's a shame that the only review Amazon could find to print is by somebody who obviously does not like this band, because there are two distinct schools of thought on the subject of whether they are or are not any good. Personally, I believe that they are, but that this album catches them before they got to be really, really good -- for which my favorite is BEATSONGS.The thing is, the strange amalgam of melodic, guitar-driven, pop rock with a lead vocalist who declaims rather than sings his lyrics is not something that works for every listener. There is a melodic quality to his reading, but he is definitely speaking, and for some people that is just too weird. For others -- maybe one listener in four, by my observation -- that is just too cool, and an abiding fascination for this band is the result.SWAGGER and ROUGH MUSIC are also good examples of the best of Blue Aeroplanes. TOLERANCE has moments of brilliance but obviously has some polish yet to be developed."
4,Nice material but not much design ...,The material feels luxurious but the fit is so-so. Need to improve on the cut and design.
5,Love!!,"If you have not yet experienced the vocals of Cilette and the musical genious of Roman - you no longer have an excuse. Ten years ago I had to share an office with a girl from the west coast. She had to have music in our little space and asked if it was okay. I kept hearing her music shuffle to this haunting voice and I would have to stop my work to listen. Finally I had to ask her who this band was, where could I find their music, and why didn't I hear them on radio play. She explained the band is from the west coast and I promplty went home and searched for their music. I own their entire collection and always anxious for new material. You cannot get tired of this music! Treat your ears to some of the richest vocals and musical arrangement, you won't be disappointed."
3,Not the best...,"I bought this DVD because it was a good price, but I'm not overly impressed with the quality. There are two work-outs: beginner and intermediate, but they are taped at the same time, and the camera angle is just changed for them. There are also random sequence clips inserted that don't match what the instructer is telling you. The audio instructions and the visual don't match a number of times, especially in the beginner. The results seem to be okay, but not terrific for 20 minutes of work. I wouldn't buy anymore pilates for life DVDs."
1,:arem Jamsems Shell,A disappointing item. Size Large might be for a large child but definitely a very small misses.
5,Love it!,"Love it! My dad had one when he was young so he bought it for my 8 year old son. He very interested in the human body. I painted, glued and assembled before he received it - too difficult for my son. It was not easy - like any model it has many parts and difficult directions but the finished product is awesome. I learned a lot about where everything is in the body :) You do need glue and 8 different colored paints."
4,Good but not solid one,"The book starts every chapter with good start but ends each chapter with so so. I guess the authors start each chapter with great enthusiasm and then lose it towards the end chapter. The book has some mistakes in the worked example, as simple as transforming impeadance to admittance and vice versa. It has also other rigorous mathematical mishap.I do recommend it but not to starters since it could easily confuse . I hope the authors revise it and correct the mistakes and carry the enthusiasm to the end of each chapter."
1,Making quick money,"This book theories on that The Lord of the rings is a covert allegory of the Gospel.If you are any fan of Tolkien you probably know that the one thing he hated more than anything was just that; allegory's.In my opinion, this book only sells the opinions of its writers and has nothing to do with Tolkien who always thought that every reader should interpit his books in his own way.An easy way to make some quick bucks in my opinion, buy some of Tolkiens work instead and make up your own mind."
2,poor contents,"you cannot discuss another world with the customs of this world. the world that tolkien had created never existed and it is completely different than this one (and if you have any doubts, take a look at silmarillion). there's a lot of another sort of things to take a look at in a book, you have to live in the world of the writer, not your world. this is what the authors couldn't do in this book. in my opinion, this book is waste of money."
2,Keep Looking,"This short book uses the themes and stories of Tolkien's Trilogy to draw similarities to various themes and stories from the Bible, with each chapter ending with a simple little reflection. It's actually more of a devotional work than scholarly work. People who are looking to learn more about Tolkien and his Christian faith should continue to look elsewhere - such as ""J.R.R. Tolkien : Author of the Century"" by Tom Shippey.Each chapter starts with a retelling of an event in Tolkien's trilogy, and continues to explore the theme or lesson to be learned from that event as it is also expressed in the scriptures, then ends with simple sentence reflection. The book sheds no real insights for anyone who has read Tolkien's trilogy and the Bible.As far as the Trilogy being secular or sacred, Tolkien was equally clear that while he was not writing an allegory, a myth may have some truth in it."
4,Finding God in The Lord of the Rings,"Any serious Tolkien fan, any person who has spent countless hours reading and re-reading The Lord of the Rings, will be enlightened by this inspiring look into J.R.R. Tolkien's spiritual life and the affects it had on his writing.The comparisons and parallels detailed in this book are not only an asset to Christian education, but are essential to everyday life."
1,Silver Apples - Decatur,"This album was a major departure for Silver Apples from anything else they've done. It is one song (if you want to call it that), 43 minutes + in length. A long drawn out series of sounds that I personally can find no connection with.I talked with Simeon (the founder of the group) at a concert, shortly after Decatur was released. By his own words ""We kind of stuck our necks out on that one."" I'll say. It is kind of relaxing in its own way, but I warn you, don't buy it if you're expecting music like Silver Apples/Contact or Beacon - this is completely different. Some people might call it ""ambient"". I call it a waste of their talent."
1,this is a horrible album,"This album is NOT good. I got it for free and I use it to put my drink on. His lyrics are just for shock value and he talks in all similies. Canibus and Ras Kas are much better. I'm from NJ and so is he but Chino went CA to record this???? Some of the samples are cool but I don't like songs where the chorus says ""I'm a creep, I'm a loser"" Damn.. he is a loser..."
1,Chino just like them Pants,"Weak debut album ive heard Chino on the Wake Up show and he has got lyrics! However he overdoes it always talking do-do and uses to many metaphors. The reason no one has heard of Chino is because he likes Men who were XL size pants and he likes to get into mens Chino's size XL!! His lucky Pac died b4 they met up cos he would of been Chino RIP if you want lyrics and good production with meaning check out Crooked I, Heltah Skeltah, Cocoa Brovaz, OGC, Canibus, Afu Ra and Rass Kass plus Kurupt! peace."
4,"Stephen Colbert Might Not Use 'Em, But You Can.","Stephen Colbert may have declared polyhedral dice obsolete, but we know better. ;-D These dice are a standard set -- d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and another d10 for percentile rolls. The bag is very nice -- well-made and with a fancy logo. The dice themselves are somewhat of a disappointment, since they are bright, almost childish pastel colors instead of something more elegant, but there's a sensible reason: novice players can quickly identify the dice by color, instead of trying to tell the difference between (say) a d8 and a d10."
4,Nicon Cool Scan Review,"I find the use of the scanner to be good, but in some cases a bit long in time. The software loaded with no issue and works as advertised. I have issues being able to use some features, but this can also be resolved. For the individual user one slide at a time takes time but it is how it is. One issue is you cannot have two scanners on the USB at the same time, so you will have to remove one from the buss.I would recommend this product, it preforms well and is easy to use. Hardware Intel 3Gig Processor, XP Pro."
3,Don't use for a large batch of slides.,"Works very well and is great for negatives or small numbers of slides. However, it doesn't support the SF-210 slide feeder, which is essential for doing large numbers of slides. (despite its known problems with jamming, the SF-210 is much better than hand feeding slides individually)If you're planning on scanning more than 100-200 slides, you really need a slide feeder. Trust me.The stock software isn't very good, particularly on mac (it's a PowerPC app, so it needs to run in Rosetta on an Intel mac). I use Vuescan, which is much better and very reasonably priced."
3,Magic movie but not book,"After reading this book I learned Mel stuart deserves a alot of credit, and rightly so, for bringing to the movie that timeless magical quality that after decades, I never get tired of. However, Mel leaves out to much behind the scenes, personal accounts, stories, general info. esp. as it pertains to the rest of the cast for this to be an enjoyable read.However, if you love the movie as much as I did, you will still want to buy this book at least to get Mel's take on the making of the movie."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I think they pretty much took most of their stuff from the CSET web page, which has free downloads of helpful information."
1,how to ship arrows?,"I buyed this arrows from Amazon.com , but was shipped from SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE, they don't know how to ship arrows, they tie all arrows together and destroy at last half of the vanes...good product but bad shipping people..."
2,No points,These arrows don't come with points. Now I'm trying to figure out how to fix that. The good news is they were packed well with a plastic separator.
3,Weird Flavor,A book a bit too long. Rather difficult to characterize. Not bad but not very good. A story I was eager to discover and found dragging on. The main interest of this book lies in the uncanny atmosphere JB creates to make you believe the world is not what you know it is.
4,Gerbert's Beanstalk,"This ""new"" (1992) episode features Gerbert in a true-life circumstance that kids encounter every day. For the first time Roary comes to life and they take an imaginary trip up the gardener's vine to the land of toys. Once there, they learn a lesson in greed when Gerbert decides one toy is not enough. Gerbert's greed leads to the Giant's capture of Roary. All ends well, however, as Gerbert realizes that Roary is much more important than any toy or possession. <Based on the video jacket>This is a video for 3 to 6 year olds."
3,The Autograph Man,"Alex-Li Tandem's life is selling, collecting, and trading famous autographs. Sometimes he even forges them! He yearns for one special autograph, one of the elusive forties actress, Kitty Alexander. After having written to her since he was a teenager, he mysteriously received an authentic autograph. Things change, as he endeavors to discover how he came upon this rare and authentic autograph.Zadie Smith sure has an unusual style of writing! But she can sure develop characters! I fell in love with her characters, all of whom felt so very real, as if I had actually met them! Her humorous style made me laugh out loud. What an unusual experience this book was!"
1,Torture!,"I hate to be the first person to give this book a 1-star rating but after about the first 50 pages or so I found it a TORTURE to read. Zadie Smith is a talented writer, and I had very much enjoyed her first novel, but I could barely make myself finish this one. Some of the problems with it: I didn't like the main character enough to really care about what happened to him. Also, (I'm Jewish myself but) I found all the stuff about Judaism tiresome."
1,The Autograph Man,"Shockingly bad! I can't believe this actually got published,I found it incredibly hard to continue only tried to finnish it because it was given as a birthday present... advice don't waste your time or money."
1,NOT the sound quality of the original LP,This is NOT the quality of the LP. Bass/ treble balance is way off. Volume of spoken portions is way softer and background way louder than the original. Disappointed.
1,Gravely Disappointing,"I was a huge fan of JMC up until this album, which was one screeching guitar after another with no latching melody. It was so bad, that I assumed it was their last. Nine years later after watching Lost in Translation, I realized they recaptured their character and squeezed out a few more LPs. Nonetheless, I'd skip this one."
3,one works the other one no,"I have ordered 2 torches, they are smaler than they look but this is not aproblem, one works great, the other one lasted less than 10 dives, it does not turn on anymore even with new batteries, I realy do not know why...but the other one is great, not as primary torch but a very good choice"
3,Could be better...,"The concept is great and my daughter loves being able to gnaw on her frozen fruits (and I love not having to mash them all!) however, we no longer use this one. It is way too difficult to take apart after use, especially with slimy banana all over it! Also, the ring shaped handle is too awkward for her to easily hold on her own. We now use a different brand with straight, chunky handles and she has absolutely no problems."
1,"poorly designed, pain to clean","Awful product. I would not recommend it to anyone. It's not only poorly designed (too many parts, too many little crevices that food can get trapped in that make it a pain in the you know what to clean) but it's also poorly constructed -- the mesh bag is not completely finished on the inside. It has a raw edge which helps the fabric unravel fast, posing a danger to your baby if you are not careful with it as another reviewer wrote earlier."
1,DO NOT buy this product,"Within three uses, the stitching at the end of the mesh bag had come open and my 6-month-old baby had a large piece of fruit (aka a choking hazard) in his mouth. Do not buy this product."
5,My 5 month old LOVES these feeders,"My 5 month old son loves to eat bananas and avocados out of this feeder. I also have the Munchkin brand and these are easier to clean. As others have mentioned, it gets messy but that is how babies learn to feed them self."
1,Weak and incomplete,"While this book will give a newcomer *some* idea of how to use XML with Microsoft's XML parser, the examples are weak, and it is difficult or impossible to find detailed information. For example, MSXML DOM methods are listed, but often no parameters are described or explained. The reader is left to experiment to find out how things really work. You are far, far better off getting the Wrox book IE5 & XML, by Alex Homer."
2,"Short on real examples, long on pontification","This book will give you the same information you can find out on the Web about XML. All hype and no actual real world use of the technology. The included code examples were buggy as well.As a developer who is in dire need of information to complete a project, I have more questions than answers after reading this book."
4,good songs from the harmonica master. The earliest takes.,The earliest takes of Sonny Boy at the Trumpet Recordings. Powerfull style and quality. Good songs.
2,I made a mistake,"I made a mistake if this was listed as ""used"", because that's how it came. I think that beauty products should never be sold as used. It's just not sanitary! I was not very happy."
2,Did not receive,Ordered product and about 2 weeks after I received shipment confirmation I did not receive. Went to track package but it was obvious that the tracking number was made up (tracking number said 123). Contacted seller and they said that it was a mistake but they would ship right away. Still did not receive. They did refund my money.
3,Doesn't Work Well,"I bought the same phone as my boyfriend so we could talk on Skype. Although his phone worked just fine mine had several issues that had to be mechanical in nature. Some of the issues I experienced was that it would not let me dial in numbers directly to the phone, I had to save them as a contact and then it would allow me to dial from my phone. It also just sometimes wouldn't work, and sometimes would. It was very unreliable.These phones seem to be a little flaky, but my boyfriend's phone always worked the correct way even when hooked up to my computer."
3,Reception,"I find that the reception with the Linksys Cordless Internet Telephony kit is inconsistant. At times the reception is fine, at others poor. I'm not sure if its the cordless phone or SKYPe itself. When functioning well it's heads above using you computer mike."
2,CIT200 Disappoints,"My 2-star rating records my disappointment with it's overall performance. It does free the user from the computer, but the price of this freedom has to be counted in lost ability to access skypeout calls, either from the phone or from the computer. In fact, the phone rendered my computer useless as a skype terminal. I can only make skype calls from the phone. This loss of functionality was an unwelcome surprise."
4,Pretty cool gadget,"It's very convenient if you have skypeout and skypein, you can use it as a regular phone with prices that no phone company can offer, I don't even have a home phone anymore, the range of the wireless phone is incredible, I can walk around the house with no problems whatsoever.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes when the call ends, the phone goes a little crazy and says SKYPE DISCONNECTED, but it's only a matter of seconds until SKYPE is recognized again and the phone is back. Another thing I don't like is that when you call, the skype screen on the computer pops up, and that can be a little annoying."
4,Very convenient,"This phone works like a charm. The USB setup makes it convenient and easy to use without the need for a digital phone line. The only glitch is that sometimes it won't load the Skype contacts on the handset, and to fix this the handset has turned off then on. This doesn't really take much time/effort but its a glitch.Overall - very satisfied with the phone, reception, sound quality, installation."
4,a very very good start,"this product is very nice, and beats IM by miles...as a previous reviewer had stated, you really should restart your computer after installing it onto the computer, for it to load on...also, the sound quality, although not perfect, is very good, for how cheap this phone is. everything i needed was there, the instructions are hard to follow, asthey give no real information on how-to, so you really have to read everybodies review, or monkey around with it first.this phone is very nice, and i'm very certain you'll enjoy it. :)"
4,Careful when installing on Vista,"The CIT200 Skypephone (now iPhone), works very well once you have managed to install it. This is the second one I own, but the first on a Vista system. The installation CD doesn't auto-run on Vista, and opening manually the installation folder to try to install directly from the .exe file yielded no results. Since my e-mail to Linksys support was returned with an automated message saying that this service had been terminated, I had to figure out things on my own: you have to go to the Linksys products page and look for software downloads for the CIT200."
5,Big Fan,"I loved this movie. I am glad that Brittany Murphy got to play in this. She was great. The movie is called Tribute, now I see it as a tribute to Brittany. Watch it!"
4,This Nora Roberts Film Was Pretty Good,"I actually really liked this one, total twist at the end. Murphy does a pretty good job, I enjoyed it."
1,The Worst Toaster Oven EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"This oven burns everything it cooks!!! The top gets way hotter than the bottom and it comes on when it is supposed to only be baking. If you buy this oven you're really you'll be sorry, and your friends will laugh at all the burnt food cook. Amazon why can't I rate this item a ZERO STARS??????"
4,Great for cooking and saving on the electrical costs,I love the oven and the broiler.It is in great condition with no problems with the finish at all.I can clean it very quickly and it looks expensive on the counter.I do have one problem with the rack that comes out too easily so I am careful to use mits and watch that the things do not get away from me as I take them out.I would buy it again but would appreciate a stop notch for the rack.
1,Smoke doesn't look as nice,"The great appearnace and slide out crumb tray made this seem as if it was a really good oven. The first few times that I tried toast it took too long and came out dry and uneven. The 4th time I tried toast, I went for broke and put in 4 slices of wheat bread. It must have sensed that I was trying to tax its cabilities because it issued thick smoke from the control chamber on the right side. The smoke just doesn't look as nice as the oven, so I decided not to keep it. I think this is a pretty poor record of usage for less than a week."
4,Don't Understand the Problem,"I finally purchased this item, inspite of the negative reviews, because my good old toaster finally gave out. The paint is not chipping. It's sits squarely on the counter and it's a sturdy solid machine. It toasts and broils chicken just fine. I haven't tried baking with it yet. One warning I would add is in agreement with the person who mentioned how easily the rack slips out. Yes, it does! So what I do is take an oven mit in my left hand and hold on to the tray while sliding it out. I've also taken to using a pair of bamboo tongs to flip and remove food items. Works just fine and you won't get burned or try to grab that tray with bare hands if it starts to slip. So this is an oven, it gets hot, it ain't no two slice toaster. Give it plenty of room on your counter top and you two will get along fine."
1,Not much bang for your buck.,"This product just goes to show you that you don't always get what you pay for. In short, this Kitchenaid toasts unevenly and takes one cycle to even warm up well, seems to be cheaply made, the ticking timer keeps right on ticking way past the shutoff and doesn't coincide with the bell (which may or may not work), and is just a big disappointment overall. We went with it because of it's smaller size and features that we wanted, but I will sacrifice some counter space to get a well-made toaster oven the next time."
4,Attention Cake fans,"The Unicorn sound is certainly unique, but appealing in many of the same dimensions Cake is. There is a sparse arrangement but driving beat and slightly funky Atari-esque effects . Simple and melodic but not sweet or power-poppy. Similarities also to the irreverent tweakiness of Ween."
4,Making Out,"If TV on the Radio, early Modest Mouse, and Belle and Sebastian decided to make out, this album would be their love child. Add to the bastard child some seroiusly super-quirky lyrics, and you have the kind of teeth-rotting pop that I dare not listen to with my convertable top down for fear of looking like a total dork."
2,I really wanted to like it...,"Everything I'd heard about this album seemed good. Comparisons to TMBG are always a plus. And then... I actually got it.On the pro side, the music -is- original, and there's more than a little humor to their lyrics. The songs -do- remind me a bit of TMBG's earlier work. That said:I don't know who mixed this album, but they appear to have been -trying- to wash out all the vocals with the music behind them. If this was their intent, they succeeded magnificently. Those of you who want to understand the lyrics will be out of luck.The music is unoriginal, at best. After a few tracks, and with no lyrics to queue from, I found it hard to tell one song from another except by the track-changing gaps on my CD player.I really wanted to like this album. Sadly, I think it'll be the first thing I try to trade in when I next hit the Used CD store near me."
1,Ahhhhh!!!!!,The Kind of Crap they'd Play at a 2 year old girls birthday party!!!!!!! Terrible!!!!!!!!! of my god i hate it!!!!
4,Recommended,It was recommended by my child's teacher. She likes the entire series. I had to buy quite a number of them. Cost adds up.
3,Good Intro Thats it......lacks depth,"It is a good intro to how mind and body become one and how medicine is evolving to the next level. She could have easily become the CAPRA of bio medicine but the books falls short, though there is not mistaking her ability to be one For intresting work on similar feild look to the technology of Design Human Engineering and its cheief prophet the one and only RICHARD BANDLER"
1,Further evidence that Dr. Pert has left science behind.,"In this work, Candace Pert, Ph.D., once a fiery research neurochemist at the National Institutes of Health, continues her descent into the ""New Age"" pop metaphysics of Deepak Chopra. Too bad.As the previous reviewer noted, Chopra fans will love this book. Bleah."
1,Too thick; doesn't lather very well,I'm not crazy about this brush cleaner. It's too thick and gooey. Doesn't lather very well and takes a lot to completely rinse out from your brushes. Save your money and use baby shampoo instead.
4,Worthy,"What can I say, the Finns grow on you.For me, no other artist can match Neil Finn's sense of intimacy in songwriting. This album is no exception, with songs about the strength and death of their mother, as well as some upbeat memories and celebrations of new relationships. I sense a bit of compromise in the musical collaboration of the Finns. I don't find a standout single, but like most things Finn (Crowded House, Split Enz) their work is best taken in as a whole album. Crowded House fans will appreciate the album."
3,Dodge Chilton Repair Manual,"Its a repair manual, what can I say. It showed up in good shape, wasn't ripped or torn. Gotta admit, its not a great repair manual. I thought I was being smart and ordered a Haynes along with it. Thinking ""if one doesn't have the info I need, the other will"". Wrong! They are the same dang book, except for different covers, word for word too. Don't waste your money on both."
1,FPS with Magic not Shadowrun,"They should have just put out a FPS with magic. This is nothing like the Shadowrun game, I am very disappointed in this. The options are limited you don't really gain any weapons, spells or even cybernetic enhancements that you can keep, you have to keep purchasing them at the beginning of every match with very little time to decide what you want as it rushes you in to a capture the flag match. There is no real team feel to this game even you healing tree can heal the enemy or your team there is nothing that really stands out. I find it very lacking as even a FPS it fails to grab my attention and hold it. Lucky for me it wasn't very expensive."
3,bought for a science project,We bought this clock for our 4th grader to use as part of a science project. It is cheaply constructed and the clock piece does not fit nicely as pictured - it hangs down in the front by the wires. Having said that - it does work as stated. We have two potatoes that have been keeping time for a week. Too bad it is so over-priced for what it is.
4,misrepresentation,"I ordered this CD strictly because of the track listing I saw here. Unfortunately, it is not accurate. Several of the tracks you see here are not on the actual CD. While the CD that arrived is good, I could've bought it and had it on the day I wanted it instead of waiting for it to ship. So be warned."
3,This was a gift,"This was a gift so I've never seen the product. I was told she was happy with it. Since I don't know anything else about it (construction, fit, color, fabric feel) I gave it a neutral 3 stars."
5,METAL!!!!!!!!,"What can I say, love his first documentary on metal bands and fans. Sam's new series on breaking down each section of the metal universe is fantastic. I showed to some of my friends, they were surprised that it's not all satanic metal, than a bit of old blues, jazz, and classical. I would get this for my friends as gifts. Even if they never heard of the series. Their metal fans right down to the core. Hopefully next season he can tap into black metal, if he needs any help he can email or talk by phone. :)"
2,no subtitles,"I've bought because I imagined that would have at least english subtitles. Nope. Excellent content but poor quality DVD, almost amateur.Sam Dunn, VH1, you should note have authorized this"
3,Great content - not so great quality,The DVD arrived quickly and in good condition. The content of the DVD is fantastic however the quality is not so great- skipped many times as previous reviews stated.
1,Dumb as it gets,Dumb book based on a silly mistake. Read Knight and Lomas if you want to find out what could really be going on here.
3,Archie at Halloween,"This movie was alright to begin with but the Vampire movie was too long. I got up and left the room after a while. I am an older adult and thougt this might be fun to watch, so maybe if I was a kid I would have liked it better."
3,An option - one of many.,We carry 2 kayaks and a canoe on our rack system and were looking for a good pad for our items which may touch one of the 3 bars but not necessarily strap to it (we use q towers and outdoorsman 300 on a Toyota Tundra). Easy to put on like rest of Yakima's products BUT they were small in width and we felt robbed ($30). Returned them to the store and bought an oversided pool noodle for $3.99 and it fits the bar all the way across (66 in) and snugly. We'll see how it fairs in time. Even if I have to make a cover for the noodle I still would have saved $25 in the end.
5,One of the best Biochem books that you will find,"After many years, Lehninger continues to be the most authoritative book in Biochemistry. Biochemistry is a very fascinating subject that requires a lot of organization, what a student least wants is to struggle with the organization or wording of the book.The topics on this book are logically developed and takes the reader hand through its contents in detailed manner. I would say that this is one of the few books that can be considered as a bible. I see a promising future for this book since no book as come close to Lehninger."
5,Great little mic,"I adore this mic. I was stoked to see the packaging it came in too. This mic wants to save the world.I needed a mic for my Mac Pro... mainly for google voice. I have a 27 inch LED display so the mic on this thing isn't that great. Now when I talk to people, they don't feel like they are on speakerphone.My only complaint is that I wish it looked a little closer to Bob Barkers mic. I almost feel like him when I talk into it!"
4,"Excellent for video-chatting, Good for recording","Definitely good enough for video chatting, but I bought it for recording. It is extremely clear, provided you set it up the right way, but it is also extremely sensitive, so you will have to be recording in a quiet place, and don't ever speak/sing right into the mic. If you are looking for a recording mic but can't afford a $60+ mic (such as snowball), this is a good alternative.Just a note: since it is a USB mic, you can't hear any instantaneous playback while recording (delayed playback can be set up in mic properties, but that's pretty much useless)."
1,Does not work on Windows 7 64bit,"I have spent a long time trying to figure out why the microphone is so quiet. It uses 32bit USB audio drivers on Windows 7 64bit. This appears to be the problem. There is no solution from Logitech and my research yielded a bunch of people with this same problem. Do yourself a favor if you are on Windows 7 64bit and look for another mic. I am going to avoid Logitech entirely, I have had too many bad hardware experiences with them."
5,No muss no fuss,"Installation of this microphone was a breeze under Vista. I simply plugged it into one of the USB ports, Vista recognized it and installed the drivers. All I had to do was to adjust the recording level (the default was set very low, at a level of 9 out of 100). All you have to do is follow the instructions that come with the microphone if you aren't sure how to make adjustments.The recording quality is fine, as well. It records to a .wma file in CD quality as the default.My only complaint: the person who designed the packaging is a moron. It comes in one of those awful plastic shells that are hard to open and cut. But the microphone itself is well worth it."
1,Doesnt work with Windows 7,Should have checked other reviewers feedback before ordering -- does not work well with Windows 7 for some reason. You need to be about 1/2 inch from the microphone for it to pick up anything.
1,Didn't Work For Me,I bought this mic for use with my Dragon naturally Speaking software. As soon as i connected it and tried to test the sound quality i noticed there was static and overwhelming background noise. The noise cancellation feature was non existent. Upon my research i found out that some user on Windows XP like myself are having the same issues and it seems to be an issue with the sound card and USB aspect of this mic. So if your on windows XP you might wanna do some research first before purchasing this mic. I returned it immediately and ended up going with the Logitech h250 headset (since its not a USB mic) and it works flawlessly with my voice recognition software
4,Very Pleased,"I am doing a podcast show from my home office for the first time, and this microphone is perfect. You can't beat the price for the quality of the product. It is so small and fits easily onto a shelf in the office when I'm not recording. Although it took me a few days to figure out how to use it with my software, I would definitely recommend this microphone!"
5,Works well!,I bought this for use with dragon speak - voice recognition software. The microphone worked great from the beginning. Love that plug and play. No issues with set up or use.
3,Logitech USB Desktop Microphone Excellent but ...,"Logitech USB Desktop MicrophoneExcellent but ... the point where the microphone enters the base is very fragile. Of the two I ordered for my sons at Christmas 2011, one only lasted 4 months. The Logitech USB Desktop Microphone is an excellent value except for this."
5,Works Great,Just the best. Call on Skype without the headset and the quality is still absolutley amazing.
3,not worth the price,"there is nothing wrong with this mic, i bought a 4 dollar mic and my friends said it was decent clarity. i buy this mic and no one can tell a difference... save the 16 bucks..."
1,Does Not Work in Windows 7,"If you have Windows 7, do not even bother to purchase. It does not work. I needed an economic USB microphone and this appeared to be the right solution. I bought two for the office, but it just didn't work. Aside from downgrading to Windows XP, there is no solution in Windows 7. I checked with Logitech support and they confirmed. On the plus side, the return process was painless."
5,Microphone Check.,This microphone was simply plug and play. I run Windows XP HE and it recognized the hardward with no problems. The device works well with Audacity. The noise reduction worked well also because my daughter was playing in the background and the tv was on and neither came through in my recording.
3,Very Quiet,"The microphone is very quiet on Windows 7. Even when the microphone volume is set to high, it is almost too quiet for others on Skype to hear. When it does somehow is louder, it will randomly drop in volume. Sound quality is decent however."
3,"Sounded great, but broke easily","I loved my microphone until about 3 months into using it when the microphone stem snapped neatly off the base. I had just dropped it once off my desk onto the floor, barely a 2-foot drop onto carpet, and it didn't hold up at all. It was right at the base of the microphone stem where it's at it's thinnest & weakest point. Poorly designed, in my opinion. Either a different material other than plastic, or a thicker base would have easily prevented this being an issue."
2,Disappointed,"Logitech USB Microphone. I'm sorry to report that this device does not work very well. Windows interacts with this device in ways that are particularly annoying to me. At one point I received an error message from Microsoft, telling me that it had disabled some of the functionality of this device -- for my protection. I slept much better that night, knowing that Microsoft was watching out for me -- much as they do when, in Microsoft Word, the program insists that the first letter of the first word on any line, be capitalized. Thank God for Microsoft. Sadly, their presence on my computer is a reality, and they don't work well with this microphone."
1,WARNING! NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 7,"This product is not compatible with Windows 7 & such a important information is NOT AVAILABLE on Amazon's web site for this product. If you are using Windows 7, please look for other options."
1,Breaks very easily,"I do not often write a product review but my experience with this microphone was so bad that it warrants one. I received the package, opened it, and noticed that the arm is placed on what looks like a rotating bearing. So I figure I try to rotate it forward and see if fits that way under my monitor. I applied hardly any pressure but the arm broke off. Turns out that it cannot rotate at all. Why design this so that it looks that it can rotate? Why make it so very fragile?"
2,Did Not Work. At All.,"I use Vista. Contrary to most comments, it generally works fine. But not with this microphone. OS did not see this device. It was invisible. Logitech site was absolutely useless -- they provide no drivers. Googled for drivers. Nada. Why buy something new and have to fool with it? Buy something else."
4,needs an interface of some sort,this thing is a good mic. want to say that first. the problem is.... it is too sensitive. my speakers are three feet above my mic. they are pointed out into an open room. and i have to turn them down to where i can almost not hear in order to keep peeps on skype from having to listen to what im doing. this is a huuuuuuuuuge annoyance
4,Works well with Linux,"This works well with Linux. It's plug and play. I use it for Skype when my wireless headphones need to be recharged. It shows up as ""AK5370, USB Audio"" in the sound devices for Skype.I'm using plain ALSA without any extra sound daemons or pulseaudio."
5,Logitech does it again,"Its another awesome product from Logitech, especially for the price. The sound quality is good, the cord is long enough to move it anywhere on my desk, but not too long so that it leaves a tangled mess underneath. The on/off button is great if you use voice activated VOIP software and you want a quick easy way to mute."
2,Speaker Feedback,"Tried for hours to get this to work but it just gives massive feedback to the speakers. If I turn down volume settings no one can hear me, if I turn them up, massive feedback. And the speakers are 2 1/2 feet away. Other mics and headphones I have gotten to work just fine. Any suggestions are welcome, if I can get it to work I will change my review."
4,Very functional and cheap,Best quality audio? I would not go that far but it is my microphone for recording lectures for an online course I am teaching and the microphone was never the issue when I ran into software/hardware issues in putting on the course.
3,Great at first but quality fades.,"This mic was great for a few months but I started to sound too deep after a few months of use. I do got kids around here so they could of been the reason though but not sure. I also had to talk really loud. I rather stick to cheap mono mics. I'm an internet radio DJ and I was constantly told that I sounded terrible with this mic. But with the cheap mono mics, I rarely get complaints. This would of got 5 stars if I rated on the first month but for long term I give this 3 stars."
5,Used with speech recognition just fine,Good looking and easy to use microphone. We used it with a speech recognition software without having to play much more for higher end mics. Recommend if you have the desk space.
2,Can't recommend it,"This mic is not very good, even at such a low price point, and I say that as a devout Logitech fanboy. It's admittedly cheap and easy to set up and use, but the recording quality is terrible. First, sound isolation is nonexistent; unless you're recording in a perfectly quiet room, you will not get a clear reading. It's just far too sensitive. I suppose that's great for people who want to do voice recording and live in the middle of nowhere, but for people like me who want to use it for Skype or Teamspeak and live in a normal town with cars, it is just pathetically bad. I can't recommend it unless you have a very specific purpose in mind, and at that point, you probably want to spring for something a bit more high-end."
2,BSOD on Vista,"When I plugged this into my computer running Vista, I got a blue screen of death. When I already had it plugged in, and started the computer, Vista wouldn't boot up correctly. Randomly, I got it to work, but it was too much trouble so I just went back to my cheap one that works okay anyway. I may try this on my XP computer later. Maybe that will work."
2,All great -- but lasted only about a year before it broke,"I'm not a heavy user, but just from this microphone sitting on my desk it managed to break at the base. It still works (although the stick no longer stands up and just lays down) so I had to give it a -3 for lack of durability."
4,A rich story worthy of wide readership.,"In a field of much-hyped and overhyped ""legal thrillers"", some of which are merely poor imitations of Grisham and Taylor Rosenberg plots, this book stands out for its uncannily interwoven depiction of the many characters involved in a criminal investigation, from the journalists who cover it, to the politicos whose weigh in their agenda interests, to the prosecutors and police officers, to the victim who turns out to be not quite what he seemed to be in life. The characters have rich emotional histories which come into play, and there is even a very touching romance subplot. A great read!"
1,Not happy with the quality- washed very poorly,"I got this set as a shower gift, I had registered for Koala Baby receiving blankets, a bath towel, and the robe and booties set. I washed several receiving blankets along with the towel and robe, on GENTLE cycle, and dried on low/delicate setting. There are strings hanging everywhere off the robe and towel, and the receiving blankets have frayed edges after one washing. I am very disappointed at the quality of these specific Koala Baby products and do not recommend them."
3,Not as clear as Panasonic,Keep getting cut off. Voice not as clear as Panasonic. Answering base needs reset/pull plug time to time in order to play message. Maybe I just got bad unit!!!
1,This book listed for $6.99 is not Hardcover as noted.,It is listed incorrectly as a hardcover when it's not. The book itself is wonderful.
3,Looks better in the picture than reality,"My disappointment started when I opened the packaging and noticed the watch tin was dented in several places (due to poor packaging?)Then, when I opened the box, I was almost sure the wrong item was sent as the watch looked so different from the picture!The band was much thicker than expected, and the watch itself was heavier than other Fossil watches I own, thus not as comfortable to wear. The brown ion-plated band was darker-brown to black in some places, making the watch look old or used.Overall, had I known the watch's appearance in reality, I would have made another choice."
1,terrible!,"I have hated using these. I can't wait til I'm through with them to go back to lifestyles. They seem to get stuck when you roll them down, the package is difficult to open, and they have a way of becoming really dry. It's almost like they suck up moisture. I will never purchase these again and because I have disliked them so much i'll probably always avoid trojan brand."
3,Class on DVD,"Personally, I enjoyed these readings and explanations of classic literature by a man and a woman who took turns at the pulpit, in front of Christmas decorations. I found the anecdotes about ""A Christmas Carol"" interesting.But I think this DVD would bore most people."
5,Great Product,This is a really good Multivitamin. The price is not bad for such a high quality product. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good vitamin.
5,"Superb, this book is a MUST for any serious EC researcher.","The story of how a Evolutionary Computation came into being is a fascinating one. Not because of mere historical curiosity, but because in the writings of the pioneers who shaped the field one might even glimpse the future. They are an excellent source of inspiration.Those ""fossil"" are brought to live through Fogel's superb commentary. He not only fleshes out the ""fossils"", but also show how subsequent developments came into being.This book is a MUST for any one serious about understudying the field of EC in it's depth and breadth (both is subject mater and historical development)."
2,Very nice until it died -- took less than a year,"I really loved this notebook: looks COOL, ultraportable, with camera and good enough microphone to do videoconferencing on the road... BUT:The hard drive crashed after 8 months. Getting support from Sony was very difficult. I had to buy the recovery CD to get the system back up after reformatting the hard drive but it kept doing weird stuff. It finally died one month after the 1 year warranty had ended. Now I'd need to pay money to even talk with somebody at Sony about it.I paid a lot of money for this laptop and it really was nice as long as it lasted but I'd expect it to last a little longer for the price."
4,Last one in Christy Miller series,"This was a great book. As usual, this book is very hard to put down.Christy goes to Europe on a mission with Katie, Tracy, and Doug. Though Doug is her current boyfriend, her new friend Sierra couldn't even tell they were together. And why can't Christy forget the ""T"" word, Todd?"
5,The GOD of the Super Nintendo,"Ok, the title isn't exaggerating. The Game Genie for SNES, is EXACTLY why I became a gamer in the first place! The exciting things you can do with it when a hard game comes along and is just terrible to you. It easily fits a game into the top part, with a door to secure certain games, and easily slides into the deck, unlike the game genie for the NES. The power-switch is essential for certain games, when you must pass an area, without the game genie killing everything in your path. For super mario world, for example, this is the ultimate way of playing. But of course you need a code book, which is very hard to find these days for the SNES version, but if you can find the codes, buy the Genie!"
3,Cheese Slicer,Out of the box the cheese slicer worked great. It has a very comfortable handle and slices through hard cheeses very well.Con: I purchased the slicer in October and in December the replaceable wire came off and could not be re-attached. The company has a web site at [...] and and I contacted their customer service agent. There was no wait or hassle. They immediately offered my choice of either sending out a new wire or for me to send back the slicer so they could either repair or replace it. I chose to receive the replacement wire. Given it is a week before Christmas it may not get here very quickly. I will update this review once I receive the part and see if it repairs the slicer.
3,Cellet Holster,Holster holds cell phone extremely well. Belt clip tends to break easily from holster.
4,Great fun and nostalgia for the price!,"Bought this for our family for Christmas. Our 7 year old daughter loves the games! The games look and feel and sound just like they did in the 80's. Pretty easy to navigate around. We wish it had more of our old favorite games, many of the games included were unreleased prototypes that just aren't that much fun. Pitfall and RiverRaid are great. For the cost, it was worth it and we will get many hours of enjoyment out of it."
5,Great Read!,I loved this book and was sort of sad that it ended. I so enjoyed reading it. A nice glimpse into the life of a long distance swimmer. I can only be an armchair swimmer in this lifetime....but she makes you feel like you are right there swimming with her.
2,BEWARE OF THIS SELLER,"While placing this order I noticed the shipping being inordinately high, so I figured it would go Priority Mail. When I received the item, it was in a plain bubble mailer shipped First Class. Postage came to $1.50.I urge you to first contact the seller and get whatever you need in writing BEFORE purchasing anything from this seller. If you can avoid dealing with this person, the better.After a series of email exchanged between myself and the seller, I finally received a credit. It was like pulling teeth. Awful experience, that shall not repeat!Item is junk, is it worth $20? Nah, $5 is more the figure."
1,MATERIAL AVAILABLE ON BONUS TRACKS - BEING REISSUED DEC. 2007 FOR $50.00,"BEWARE PEOPLE! THIS MATERIAL HAS FOUND IT'S WAY ON THE REISSUES AS BONUS TRACKS. IN ADDITION, RHINO IS RE-RELEASING THIS BOX SET DECEMBER 2007 FOR $50.00 SO DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THESE SELLERS TRYING TO RAPE PEOPLE WITH THEIR $126.98 PRICE SET!! LAUGH AT THEM WHEN THEY ARE STUCK COMPETING WITH THE NEW BOX SET, REMASTERED FOR $50.00 AND THESE LOSERS THEN WILL BE LUCKY TO GET $25.99 FOR THEIR OLD, OUT OF DATE COLLECTIONS....LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not as expected,Color nothing like I thought it would be. Kept it figure I might be able to use it some time down the road! Tube itself appeared old and worn. No recommendation here!!
5,awesome product and price!,"I live on a small Island in Hawaii and special Items are hard to find. I have to go to one of the main Islands to try and find special chargers, and to travel inter-island is very expensive. This paslode charger is awesome and you can't beat the price. It arrived quickly and I put it to use as soon as it arrived."
4,Works well,Product works well but is a little sticky and you really have to rub it in. A little goes a long way.
2,These are just not very good safety pins,"These safety pins would probably be fine if you just need a few to have around in an emergency, but if you're going to be pinning a lot of stuff these are not very good.They don't poke through fabric well and they bend if you push too hard, but you kind of have to to get them to go though."
3,Comfort Products 60-5298 Four Motor Massage Office Chair,"Pretty good chair for the price.The massage however is kind of weak, almost useless, more like a vibrating chair."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this chair for my work, as I thought it would be something that might help out with back and neck pain due to sitting all day. Charged the chair per the instructions, and things seemed to work fine through the 1st charge cycle. Then the battery died (would not accept a charge, or work while plugged in - vibrating function would not work, regardless of what was done). So now it's just a regular chair; which would not be all bad if it was a super comfortable, high-end chair - but it's not. It is reasonably comfortable, but I don't even use it as the primary chair in my office any more.On the plus side, setup was easy and it has been a sturdy reliable chair. But for anyone who looking for a true massage chair - keep looking. Buyer beware on this one!"
2,Skip It - Get the original Genghis Khan for the NES instead,"This game is way to complicated, which games like this tend to be , but this one is the worst I have ever seen before, this was one of those games that I put in and tried to play, but i couldn't get into it at all, I thought I would love it, because I am a huge fan of the original Genghis Khan, I thought it would almost be the same just with better graphics, but I was totally wrong, that is probably why there was no other one made after the snes version, they figured out that this version was a flop, and they couldn't do no better then the original. If you love these types of games, I wouldn't waste my money on this one, I'd go with the NES version, it is alot better and alot cheaper also..."
3,Only mildly interesting...Not worth the price,"Slow moving mystery with a ""preachy"" but meaningless ending...worth one viewing so I'm glad that I only rented it. I love Claude Chabrol's 1995 film La Ceremonie and own the DVD...an A+ movie in suspense, theme, and character psychology that is as good as any Hitchcock film in its twists and turns and priceless ending. Now, perhaps, one is expecting too much."
5,Fun project,"We bought this for our 5 year old neice for Christmas, but our 12 year old neice was the one to play with it. Not sure if it was too tough for the 5 year old or if she just didn't want to try it out that day. The 12 year old had fun with the beads and making a design though. The little tool that it comes with to help pick up didn't seem all that helpful...as our older neice said it was just easier to pick beads up with her fingers."
2,Disapointing,"Alright, solidstate has some great bands but beloved is not one of them, at all. I was not only let down but very bored while listining to almost all the tracks with exception of ""only our faces hide"" the rest of the album is pretty weak! Do no waste your money on beloved's failuere on , insted go for stretcharmstrong,esocharis,normajean,stillbreathing,deadpoetic, and ,underoath! I quess you could say that is why im strictly trustkill records because they have no dissapointing band on their label !"
3,"CAUTION: Interior height is NOT 7""","Despite the manufacturer's spec (on their web-site), the interior height of this case is 6.75"", effectively less than that since it slopes down a bit toward the front and there's a card pocket protruding down from the cover. So, I'm sending mine back.That said, for the money, it seems alright, especially since it includes a rain-cover.I don't understand the messenger style flap, though - all it does is cover the outside zip pocket - it doesn't provide access to the interior. Seems useless to me."
5,Yummy,Could this be any better????? Just had the joy of seeing PVD here in NYC recently and at the WMC down in South Beach a few weeks back. He opened his set in Miami with this beauty and blew EVERYONE away. What a great tune!!!! He also blew up the Roxy with this song that had everyone screaming. A+++
2,buyer beware,"As with the adjustable bed I purchased from the same company, there is a 15 day return policy and you will incur the shipping charges. More than 15 days and you will suffer a 40% return deduction."
2,waste of money,"I've only owend an inground pool for 2 summers, but I wouldn't waste your money. I didn't notice any difference and reading phosphates? My reader said they were high and other ""experts"" readings were different. Just another way to get money out of people. I think this summer I'll just drain about 24"" of water out of my pool and then refill it with clean water... easier to balance chemicals probably."
3,"Well,","fact is that the shugarhill gang is simply a dressed up representation of what rap was and instead of trying to make something real, they tried to make something that everyone could relate to. The fact is that that isn't what rap is about. Rap is about being true to who you are and being willing to make light of it by singing about it. This isn't a rap album, it's a funk album, and the fact is that there are many better early rap albums that don't get their due because they came after this one."
3,good game,"I like the game. The only problem is that it does have a glitch. One of the level monsters is not visible. Other than that, so far the game is good"
1,Terrible,"Unfortunately this is a terrible book, in my opinion not worth the paper it is printed on. The story is confusing and confused seemingly two short novels fused into one. Fortunately I took the time to look through a copy at Borders and quickly determined that it would be a waste of money to buy it.Cannot recommend this or any other books by Gav Thorpe - he is just not a very good writer"
3,A bit slow but definately not bad,"Though this book is a bit slow, I did enjoy it. It is a fascinating glimpse into the almost mythological times of the Empire's founding and the tale of one man from that time period who returns to the 41st century to carry on his Lutherite campaign to cleanse the Empire of corruption --- thus being branded heretic by his contemporaries. Though low on action (until the end), it is heavy on brooding atmospherics and raises the question, is Astelan a heretic or the last true follower of the Emperor?"
4,"Vague, but well done.","It took me a while to understand that every other chapter of this novel was reflective in nature, but even the references to the memories the Chaplain had did very little to shed light on the heinous crime(s) committed by the Fallen. Now this may have been intentionally vague. I really had my hopes set on some specifics being given about the Lutherites and their fall from grace, and the novel did very little to elaborate on that history. Overall, I liked the book and would recommend it to any avid fan of the 40k universe or someone that follows the Dark Angels primarily. I especially liked the implied role of Cypher in the story."
4,"Good, but be careful!","I have had my Brain Bucket (love the name) for over a year. It shows no signs of wear and protects my computer superbly. It is a perfect fit for a 14.1 inch Dell. The velcro pouch on the outside is great for power cords and other accessories. The handles and zippers are very sturdy. I wish it had a shoulder strap, but that is not necessary for everyone. The only downside, and it can be a fatal one, is that the zipper opens across the bottom of the bag and the handles are at the top. It has a velcro safety strap inside to keep the laptop in place, even if the case is not zipped shut, but I once picked up the case by the handles and my laptop landed on the floor. Thankfully, there was no serious damage, but make sure you always zip the case up when setting it down, because it is not always very apparent that it is unzipped."
2,Not professional at all,"Now I know this isn't a cookbook per se, but it would help if the authors knew something about recipe writing. Many recipes contain phrases like ""let this boil for awhile. It could take a long time."" Since this is a RECIPE, I would like some more specific information!The book also expects you to spend a lot on frivolous kitchen equipment like a ""zester."" Sorry, we're not all made of money.The book is good if you have just become a vegan and have no idea what to eat. It can give you a starting point...just don't expect good results if you follow the recipes verbatim. Take a look at the names of the ingredients and dishes, and search for a REAL cookbook to help you with that!"
4,Great Book! Good for Intermediate to Expert,"This is a very good book that covers everything from CCS, Javascript, Dynamic Objects, and much much more. The only bad thing is that it is too short, I read this book in a week. It left me asking for more. I think they should expand this book."
3,poor production,"Having purchased the record when it first came out, I was looking forward to a copy on cd. I consider the album to be one of the heaviest they have done, Broadsword, and Beastie, are absolute gems. The only dissapointing aspect, on cd is the very week production, although the material is excellent, it doesn't do the album justice.I can only hope sometime in the future the album will be remastered and by that time it will definitely be worth adding the cd to my other Jethro Tull collections."
5,My first,"I bought this album for one reason only- the runes around the picture actually say something. I bought the next 3 copies because I kept wearing them out (LP and cassettes).Right after ""Songs From the Wood"" this is my favorite Tull. I didn't like ""A"" so I disagree with anyone comparing the two. I find the songs to be well written, masterfully performed, meaningful, and entertaining.""Cheerio"" still chokes me up, I want ""Slow Marching Band"" played at my funeral, but my favorite song on the disk is ""Broadsword"""
1,Didn't work for me,"I tried to connect it from the optical out on the TV set and split it to go into the receiver and into a set of wireless headphones. Once the splitter was on, I got nothing from either gadget. As soon as I eliminated the the splitter and plugged it back directly from the TV to the stereo, the connection worked find. This didn't work for my application."
1,crape,"this is a pile of junk. do not buy. good thing was the company sent me a new one that did work and handled the problem great, just no qc."
5,Just what I needed...,My surround sound only had one digital sound input. I already had the cable box plugged into it but wanted to add a PS3 for bluray. This connector did the trick with no problems. I now have two digital sound devices plugged into my surround sound.
1,DON'T BUY WILL NOT WORK,Hooked up the item like it said to it will not work tried it on three receivers did not work
1,Doesn't work.,"This product doesn't work, either as advertised, nor any other way. No matter how I finagled with it, I could get no sound to come out. Alas."
2,doest not work with S/PDIF outputs,"It works with my cable receiver/ps3 hooked up to my bose receiver via optical input, however when the same was tried for my mac book which outputs digital output - the receiver doesn't seem to be recognize it as input.I was able to hook my MB directly to the receiver through optical cable and it works ,sounds like splitter does not work for this situation."
3,One way only,"If you want to split one signal and send it to two devices, it's perfect. But, if you want to take two diffrent signals to send them to one device, it doesn't work. It's one way, and it should be more obvious."
1,didn't work,"Product didn't work as advertised.I could only get one side to output a signal to my receiver. I am purchasing a manual TOSlink switch with 3 inputs for about the same price. advise you to do the same. This product is very small and cheaply made,about the size of a newer model car key. Very unhappy. Live and Learn !!!!!!"
1,This is a splitter Not a Switch,"i bought this seeing other reviews.I have a X-Box and a Blue Ray and Bose audio system.i thought i can use this to connect both of my devices to BOSE audio system.but this dosent work like that.the best choice to do that would be to go for a switch.you can find the swith on amazon search for ""Digital Audio Explorer Toslink Selector Switch""this is for connecting two outputs to 1 input."
2,didn't work for me...,"Very low price, build quality seems high, but it just didn't work for me. I took a chance and felt it was worth the risk, as it may have worked and saved me a ton of time.There are no active parts, so if your devices do not have a strong enough signal it will not pass through this coupler."
2,results in static-y audio,"Tried using this to switch between an Xbox 360 optical audio out and a PS2 optical audio out. I had high hopes, but the resulting output is static-y and drops out, no matter what cables or configuration I try. It.. sort of works. But not well enough to keep using it. :("
1,"Didn't work for my system, even when setup properly.","I set two of these up to split the signal coming out of my xbox and PS3. My goal was to run one line to my stereo system, and one line to my headset system. So yes, I was using them as an actual splitter as designed. Both splitters lost too much signal for my devices to pick them up. Not worth returning for the $4. DO NOT BUY. It looks like these are cheaply made and some work and some don't."
1,Doesn't work,"Splitter doesn't work any way I try to connect it. Even with a cable coming into it, a cable coming out of it, and leaving the other output blank, no good. Also no good if you try to flip it backwards. I can see a light through the cable, but it doesn't seem to be strong enough to be picked up by my HT system. I would not recommend this product"
1,would'nt reccomend it,"purchased it to connect my playstation to both a headset and the sound system. I only use one system at a time either the headset or the stereo, but the splitter does not work ... it only allows one channel to work , but not the other..."
1,Don't even waste your money,"The product flat out doesn't work. I tried it in every possible configuration with my separated input devices turned on, off, unplugged, you name it...i tried it. Damn shame I wasted my time w/ this."
5,Part of a set and really popular,"Fisher price need to get these little toys out and available again, my two daughters (2 and 4) really adore this set. They are hard wearing plastic and are used in all sorts of situations, the pooh toy is the most popular followed by Piglet and tigger.They are a good size - too small to be swallowed, but small enough for little hands to be able to play with easily. Unfortunately they are easily mislaid meaning frequent searches throught the house.There are lots of fantasy games the kids play with them - far and beyond the pooh stories. There is a nice little fold out plastic pooh house which these toys fit into."
1,Frustrated,"I find it interesting (and annoying) that when I order a random toy item, that is not urgent, it comes quickly, but when I order a textbook that is required for a course I am taking and need for assignments that are already due, it takes forever for the item to begin the shipping process."
5,A surprisingly complete history on such a vast culture,"I was very surprised on how much I learned from Mr. Wolpert in this history book. It is an excellent book for beginners looking to understand more about Indian history. Most of the information is accurate and well-documented. As for traditionalist who have yet to come to the truth about archaeoligical dates and times, I would not recommend reading this book. It is based on FACT (scientific documentation) to support its allegations."
1,Hopelessly outdated,"A lot of dramatic archaeological discoveries make the early chapters of the book totally outdated. For example, it has been discovered that there exists a rock art tradition in India that goes back to 40000 BC. The Harappan tradition itself goes back to about 8000 BC. Archaeologists have abandoned the idea that the Indian civilization is a result of some invasion or immigration. The chronology of the Vedic texts is thus an open question. The more recent material is likewise very weak, slanted overmuch toward a liberal-Marxist view that the ``official'' Congress historians have espoused. The least Mr Wolpert can do is to give the book a new, major revision, lacking which it will remain hopelessly outdated."
5,Getting Better!,South Park is one of the very few shows that just gets better and funnier every season
1,Why Is It Gone?,"This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff."
4,Northern Lights,"The Seller was good to work with and I enjoyed watching the movie. It was not outstanding or a classic, but a movie to entertain you in an evening."
5,It works,"The product just plain works. I didn't expect the fragrance but I can tell you that it's a lot better than the prior funky odors. I am also talking about clothing that was well used and hasn't smelled right for a very long time. Also clothes look great after washing.Each bottle was shrink wrapped and there was no leakage per se, but the bottles were a bit slimy as if something leaked a tiny bit. I checked the volume of each bottle and they all looked full."
4,shipping probs fixed -- works great,"I ordered this stuff in mid-september 07, and the bottles came individually shrink wrapped. No spillage that others noted. Amazon apparently fixed the problem. I just finished my first loads of laundry using Win, and they smell cleaner than I ever thought would happen!"
1,Terrible.,"Much like other reviewers have said, every character in this book is detestable. And while you'd think the book would focus more on euthanasia, it really doesn't. It focuses much more on a cheating husband, and clueless wife, and a mysterious girlfriend. None of the characters are even remotely realistic-at all. Mia especially. Anyone who has ever owned at cat, knows you simply cannot toss one into your ""knapsack"" as you wish. And the fact that she mentions doing so repeatedly, gets a little annoying. Why even mention a cat at all? It certainly didn't add to the already unrealistic plot. I'm sure the book had good intentions, but this was exceptionally awful. Awful writing, awful characters, awful plot. Save your money, read something else."
3,Just OK,I usually love all of Jodie books but this was just OK! It wasn't a page turner like her others.
3,How to Affair-Proof Your Marriage,"Ah, Cam MacDonald, me lad. Micht I recommend a good book for ye: Emotional Infidelity: How to Affair-Proof Your Marriage and 10 Other Secrets to a Great Relationship by M. Gary Neuman. It could serve ye weel."
4,Love and betrayal...,"The interwoven stories of two married couples--Cam and Allie versus Jamie and Maggie. Love and betrayal are major themes that weaves around the main story of a man who loves his wife so much that he kills her.Jamie MacDonald's wife is dying from multiple cancers and is in a gerat deal of pain. She does not want to suffer anymore, but refuses to kill herself. Instead, she asks Jamie to kill her. Jamie honors maggie's wishes and then is overcome with grief and remorse. He confesses to her murder and is subsequently arrested and put on trial.Cam MacDonald, who happens to be Jamie's cousin, is the Chief of Police in Weelock who arrests Jamie. Cam feels trapped in his life and doesn't appreciate Allie, the wife who worships him and will do anything for him. Cam goes looking for excitement in the arms of Mia, a drifter who is befriended by Allie, and turns their quiet lives upside down."
3,bad ending,"I started to read this book and loved it! It was going so fast and I couldn't wait to get to the ending. Boy was I disappointed! It kind of left you hanging. There really wasn't any closure to the story of the couple. I realize that she took him back, but it really didn't even describe her feelings about it. And what about him, he had a dream all his life to travel and see the world, was he going to be satisfied to stay w/her and go back to their ""little Life"" in that small town?I have another book by her to read, all I can say is that hope the next one is better."
4,Pretty good,Pretty good book. Pretty suspenseful and keeps you going. But it kinda falls into the pattern of books she has written before. But I would still recommend it.
3,I would read it again...,"I LOVE Jodi Picoult's books. I will admit this one was hard for me, as a couple of the others have been. Specifically, I was disgusted by the husband, Cam, in Mercy - absolutely DISGUSTED. I guess it is just my own morals, but I was angry the entire time I read this book - luckily (for my friends and family) it only took me three days! That said, if I could rewind the clock, knowing how I felt about the book now, I would read it again. It is VERY well written and interesting. It made me charish what I have."
1,poor if you enjoy martin barre's guitar work,"i bought this unheard, hoping it was in the same vein as Crest Of A Knave which i also bought recently on the basis of a single song (She Said She Was A Dancer) and overall it's really excellent, particularly Martin Barre's contributions on electric guitar. Rock Island, unfortunately, is really poor in comparison. the only keeper from an instrumental point of view is the opener kissing willy, but the lyrics are too pornographic for my tastes. i guess my point is, if you want to try some later Jethro Tull (I'm a baby boomer who grew up listening to earlier Tull classics, e.g.Aqualung, Benefit & Stand Up), buy Crest Of A Knave and don't waste you money on Rock Island."
2,Not as bad as the PJTAS says,"This album doesn't deserve the bad press it has got in this forum. Sure, the songs are a bit uninspired, Ian Anderson's voice is a shadow of the past, the musicians are playing by rote, and the arrangements are formulaic. But that does not mean it won't be enjoyed by the American public, plus a few enlightened Proserpudlians. Give it a listen."
2,"Fatuous, uninspired, inane, token",There is quite a dichotomy here. People love this album; others loathe it. I wish I could count myself among the first group.
3,Swan Song for a great synth-pop band,"I have always liked MWH, but haven't kept up with them since the early 90's. Just picked up a used copy of this CD recently - I thought they had stopped making tunes a long time ago, but I guess they got back together for one more album. This album is a time capsule, stylistically. I definitely think their earlier stuff (Rhythm of Youth especially) is much richer creatively and musically than this album, but there are one or two gems: ""Christina's World"" and ""Telepathy"" are as good as anything else they have done - also, Ivan still sounds the same, which I think is a good thing.btw. you can still buy the CD directly off their website (www.menwithouthats.com)"
2,A lesser Tull album,"Tull have delivered some mighty albums in their 30-odd year history, this set doesn't rank amongst the top bracket though.Compared to their great prog-rock albums and latter day gems, Catfish seems short on inspiration.Perhaps Ian was feeling the pressure to release new product but to my mind he would have been better to have waited for better songs to present themselves.Their is a plethora of great Tull albums around. Better to look elsewhere."
4,One of My Favorites From Jethro Tull,"I have been trying to get familiar with his newer stuff because I will be seeing Tull in concert for the first time with my Dad next Friday. Out of all the newer albums I heard, this one caught my ear and has the strongest tunes in my opinion. I have been playing Catfish Rising in my car for two weeks straight now and I can't wait until October 14th to see them live."
1,what is this bs???,What's Ozzy running for title of jesus now!?!? This is the same old stuff repackaged with more annoying footage of sharron....
5,Great film!,"Saw this in the theater when it came around back in 2011 and it was a really nicely done documentary. It shows all sides of Ozzy, not just his MTV persona and his Prince of Darkness persona. He really is talented and funny. Goes back to the home he grew up in, his early years etc. I am buying this for my huband. I would love to get my hands on a documentary made in 1997 made in the UK by September Films called Ozzy Osbourne Uncut. This aired on British television and was what helped pitch the Osbournes to MTV a few years later. Wish I could find it.I high recommend this film to any Ozzy and Black Sabbath lovers."
4,Interesting,"This book provides an interesting survey of the ideas of Stirner, Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky, asserting that they advocate individualist anarchism on psychological grounds. This is certainly true of Stirner, and probably true of Nietzsche (though he can be interpreted in other ways), but rather odd for Dostoevsky. In any case it makes good reading for anyone interested in psychology and anarchism. Also present are some brief comparisons with later psychologists of freedom."
4,i enjoly this 3d dvd,i would recommend this 3d as i enjoy watching it as there is a lot of coming out of screen in it. i have watched about 3 times already and will watch it more. i don't agree with their commentary but do not get my 3ds for what they say. l buy them for the coming out of screen parts.
2,old 3d technology - bad quality,"I purchased the bluray version of this thinking it was as good as the new 3d technology or like theaters... nope, it came with the paper 3d glasses. It was a headache to watch it with the paper glasses. very bad 3d, double vision, blurry and quality wasn't good at all. glasses were so small that no way any adult can wear it through the entire show with out any problems. I am only an average guy, and it hardly fits my head. play it in 2d and the program is much more enjoyable. stay away from this show if you are expecting any type of 3d experiences. there's nothing about his bluray to enjoy at all.."
1,READ before buying,"As others have said, and I failed to read..This movie is NOT for the new 3D technology glasses. For use with the paper blue eye red eye glasses."
1,Shameful!,"Got this movie because of the reviews and my love of 3-D on my HD TV. First, the glasses had the red and blue reversed, making them unusable, but when viewing this mess, with glasses I had, there was no part of the experience that came even close to being 3-D. Unless I got a very bad copy, this was as dull in content as I would ever wish to experience, so the only thing that could possibly have saved it would have been spectacular 3-D.National Geographic has really gone way down if they consider this entertainment, and as far as the other reviewers go...well! Maybe I'm not as easily entertained as they are!Amazon, as usual, allowed me to return it."
2,harumph,"Not worth the money. Dull, uninteresting story and low level 3D effects, even on our 120"" HD projection TV screen."
3,nice film to test anaglyph,"ok show, with the main theme on the 3d effect for the anaglyph glasses. i will try it on a large screen and see if its any better"
1,This is NOT a stereoscopic 3D Movie,"I had just purchased a 3d television and was excited to see anything 3d, but when the DVD arrived it required the red/blue glasses and was not at all what i was expecting."
1,sea monsters 3d,The 3D does not work. The picture has a blue and red hase around it. I thought it might be my TV so I took it to a friends house and the same thing happened there. It's junk. I feel totaly ripped off. I've bought 4 3D movies from amazon and none of them worked. I strongly recomend you don't buy any 3D from amazon dealers.
5,True 3D experience!,"Stunning, amazing, informative and spectacular! Comes with 4 pairs of cardboard glasses. Do NOT use those (they're OK, but not great though!), Get plastic ones instead! Better fit, better view! Turn all your lights off, watch that DVD at night! It'll take your breath away! I really enjoyed it! Highly recommend!"
4,Anthology of first 3 Starquest stories,"Nice read. This single author anthology manages to mix together aliens who look like lions [think Vincent in Beauty and Beast for those who remember that far back:], Sensitives [people with psychic talents:], post-holocaust Earth complete with a Rebellion against the World Federation which is trying to wipe out the Sensitives. It has likable characters and an action-oriented plot. H/H's spend a lot of time hitting the sheets...Starquest SeriesStarquest - contains 1, 2 & 3 - Lionheart & Night of the Cat &Pride; of ImarStarquest 2 - contains 4 & 5 - Synergy & Bold JourneyBest Friends Forever #6 - currently available as ebook"
5,A Celtic/Rock Masterpiece,"This is Jethro Tull's finest work - the pinnacle of their career. Every single song on this CD is great...consecutively, they will send chills down your spine."
5,"GREAT BAND,GREAT SONGS. IN PLAIN ENGLISH, GREAT !!!!!!!!","This is not the best Tull simply because there is no such thing as ONE best Tull. Heavy Horses, Too old to rock'n'roll, Songs from the Wood, War Child, all of them would qualify. This band is great, nobody sounds similar. If you don't know Jethro Tull, buy this and prepare to be blown away!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Great sometimes, others...","The Casio fx-9750G PLUS is a great calculator for some things, terrible for others. Doing polynomial equations is simple, expecially when compared to a Texas Instruments' version. On the other hand, I have yet to figure out how to do a standard deviation. Keep in mind that if you're in high school, your course is almost definitely using a Texas - I can't tell you how many nights I've spent poring over the manual figuring out how to do the simplest of operations, while those with Texas Instruments know how to do it in a matter of minutes. If you're using it outside a formal math course in a situation that doesn't require too many complicated operations, it's a great calculator - I highly recommend. But if you're Pre-Calc or up, do yourself a favor and go grab a Texas."
2,Soveit Tragedy,Very disappointing. Malia indulges his sociological viewpoint with very little or no references to history. His opinions become dull and without much insight. It is a old time cold war smear. Wasted my money.
5,Useful for kayaks also.,I use these brackets to secure my large tandem kayaks to my roof or trailer racks. The kayaks transport upside down with the gunwhales fitting perfectly on the brackets. They protect my kayaks and the crossbars as well as limit vibration. The straps are included and have a great system for padding the steel buckles. It is commpletely secure at highway speeds. Great product.
5,Love the color!,"Finally, Pilot/Namiki are making these in colors other than the basic black, blue, and blue-black! Thought the purple is my favorite, I'd enjoy trying other colors as well - like a peacock blue (teal), red or pink. I've never had a problem with these cartridges (unlike others) and have never had any to leak or dry out. Definitely a quality product."
4,Pretty nice,"This Joystick, although I am fairly new to it has shown to be a pretty well designed pc attachment. With 3 buttons, it combines the right amount of function and are apropriatly places on the unit. All good joysticks must have the given throttle, and This one definately does not fall short. It's USB port allows access for most universal PC's. Pretty nice peice of equipment for any small time flight sim. enthusiast."
2,not worth the time or money,"I gave this two stars because the company accepted a return on the second, unopened bottle that I purchased. The bottle I opened and tried for a few days got dumped in the trash.I felt a very slight effect, but it wasn't a ""clean"" effect. I think this is because there are so many different ingredients in this product.But then I was comparing it to Lumiday, an excellent product. Actually, in trying the StressAssist, I was looking for a cheaper version of Lumiday, or something with similar ingredients. No comparison!I concluded that the strongest ingredient in Lumiday (and not in the StressAssist) is St. John's Wort.Micro-doses (1/4 capsule) of St. John's Wort worked for me for a while. Now I just realize that good diet and exercise is essential for my mental and emotional well-being."
4,home alone game,"this is one of my favorite video games. i recieved my game earlier than expected, and it's running great."
5,Sensitive is the same as baby formula,"I also received the Sensitive version not the Baby version as listed. I called the Blue Lizard company and they assured me it is the same formula, the packaging just does not say baby on it. I love this product my son has never gotten burned wearing it or had any skin issues."
1,Nothing new here,The information contained in this book could have been condensed down to 5 - 10 pages. This is old information that has been repackaged to sell books. If someone is interested in reading this book I would recomend obtaining it through an inter-library loan as I do not think it is worth the cost nor is the information unique enough to have in a personal library.
1,God's food?,"I have not read the book cover to cover. I was enjoying this book until I read the section on microwaving. Jordan says that he and his wife chose not to have a microwave in their house and then went on to say that they never had trouble heating up infant formula. HUH? Infant formula? For a man that says he wants his family to eat close to God's plan he sure is far off by feeding his own infants engineered food with chemical additives. A woman may have a choice to feed her baby human milk, but if he is going to make money on a book telling America to eat that way, then he sure better be feeding his own children as God intended. The nonchalant way he addressed it was very irritating to me. I have stopped reading the book!"
5,The outline for great health!,"If you've read ""Patient, Heal Thyself"" you know Dr. Rubin's amazing story of regaining his health. Couple that with Torahic dietary guidelines, and you've got a perfect outline for health."
2,What about the New Testament,"I have not read this book yet, but have read about it. I understand that the idea is based on the ""clean"" and ""unclean"" foods outlined in Leviticus. But what about the New Testament? When Jesus' disciples were eating with ""unclean"" hands, Jesus responded to those who questioned them by saying: Matthew 15:10-11 ""Listen and understand. What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'"" Then, in verses 16-18 ""Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.""It seems to me this is not so much a Biblical diet as it is an Old Testament diet. I'm not arguing that it's a bad diet--I think whole foods are the way to go to support a healthy lifestyle--I just think the ""hook"" is flawed."
2,silly diet for fatties.,"The makers only make people fat. Diet boloney!I guarantee you, the same fatties that will be on this diet will be on a different diet next year. A new fad diet.Diet's don't work."
1,Don,"This book ended like a slightly modified version of the Adkins diet with Prayers. Not at all what I expected. If you follow this diet, you will need the prayers."
1,"couldn't get over ""God"" writen ever third line","I have been waitinng to read this book for a while because of its reputation from Dr. Mercola. The nutritional information in it is sound, however I could not seperate God from nutrition. is this book about nutrition or God? please tell me. his story is an amazing one, but every diet book has a story like that. I would like to read soemthing from him that does not talk about God so much. your faith is wonderful but leave it for books on faith and out of nutrition books. I almost didn't finish the book. after reading it, i gave it to one of my fellow christian brothers in the hopes that they might tell me more about it. sadly, two thumbs down. maybe next time brother."
1,please read all the reviews of this book before you buy,"Jordan Rubin has questionable degrees. Use any search engine and read the articles on the degree mills.$42.5 million, that's how much Rubin made last year selling products. That number came from Garden Of Life's web site. His books are just infomericals for his expensive products. The books are given away in many natural foods stores. It's a marketing tool not a book. Just a warning, please read the all the reviews of this book before you waste time and money on this book and the products that he pushes in this marketing tool."
3,A Dark Comedy,Story of the people staying at a seedy motel. Some of them you care about some of them you don't. I believe the were trying to be funny in places but it really didn't make it. You did feel empathy for a few of the people and others you wanted to smack. It is not an academy award winner by any stretch but it is a good movie for a day you've nothing better to do.
1,Too much self-promotion,"This CD is a merely okay cd. I don't hate it, but it does not move you. However what bothers me most about this artist is his annoying self-promotion on Amazon. I don't mind people who recommend their own music around. But this guy takes it too far. You can't hardly go anywhere without seeing he has swamped an artist with his ""recommendations."" I can see by his low sales he isn't fooling many people, but I feel sorry for the people he does trick."
5,Love it,"Old skool game. I've had it forever. No collection is complete without it! I may go play it here in a minute! Actually no, but it was a great game. I enjoyed it. Took a long time to beat. Personally I like the SNES games better than the Playstation."
4,Look at this as a starter game,"Plenty of people didn't like this game, and it IS different from other Final Fantasy games, the gameplay is more simple and restrained. It's better for younger kids and the like, so this game is definitely not for everyone, but it is worth a try, at least initially, so give it a try and if after a few minutes you don't like it, that's okay, just turn it off. One thing that made this game harder was the controls, so I can't recommend this game unless you're a die-hard Final Fantasy completist."
2,Final Fantasy Jr.,"Some might say that to compare Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest to the rest of the series is unfair, since it was clearly aimed at a younger audience. However, when you use a brand name to sell a product, the product had better live up to that name. This game is not a Final Fantasy game, and only a complete FF completist should own it. It takes under 10 hours to beat, and even a six year-old could probably beat it. That's pretty much the point of it. Final Fantasy II and III for the SNES are far, far better than this monstrosity, and they still remain my two favorite games of all time. Save your money and buy those instead."
1,"Avoid it, even if it's free","Honestly, I never imagined that a Final Fantasy game could go wrong. Even the terrible FFX and X-2 I was able to enjoy. However, this piece of crap never even approaches enjoyable. Unless you're a collector who MUST have every FF game/merchandise out there, avoid it like the plague."
2,Tedious,"You can tell by this book that Eco really knows his medieval lore, but the long rambling descriptions become tiresome about halfway through. The only other Eco book I have read was ""The Name of the Rose"" which I enjoyed immensely. I was hoping that this book would be as gripping but instead I found the plot to be convoluted and occasionally the story veered off into sub plots that seemed to have no bearing on the actual story. I found myself skimming over big sections near the end in an attempt to get to the conclusion. After I finally finished this book, I wished I had put it down a lot sooner and just started on something that was actually worth my time."
5,Worked as advertised,"Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Great quality and can easily recommend to others."
5,Great!,"This little thing cost so little, but it did it's job perfectly. It is better quality than the one I got with my sound board that broke within 1 hour. This also has a gold plated tip for better connection.Every item I have ever purchased from Amazon has been 100%. Never a need for RMA."
4,Toslink to Optical MIni Adapter,Works.Plug and Play.Does seem a bit flimsy. But no issues so far with it not working.
3,doesn't work for me,I got this to hook up my digital audio out Sony Bravia tv to my Bose wave which takes an rca mini in the aux in. this isn't working. i am not sure how to get the sound from my tv to my stereo. I was under the impression that since the tip was metal it would transfer the sound. But I will just have to find another solution. This didn't cost me much anyway.
3,not what I needed,"I bought this based on the descriptions, but it turned out to be the wrong item I needed, so I'll probably be giving this to someone else as it is not worth the shipping costs to return."
5,does what it's supposed to,"I use this with a MACBOOK Pro to an optical cable and it does what it is supposed to.Make sure you note that this is being sent from China so it takes a while to get here.It fits fine and works although I've used it only a few times. I use another just like it at the other end of the optical cable to input to the SPDIF jack on a FIIO E17. I jumped the gun on a bad review, thinking it wasn't going to arrive and they called me to make sure it had arrived and ask that I remove the bad feedback. This means a lot to me, as with some other Chinese companies there is NO way to contact them for anything (FIIO)."
4,Very cute!,"This movie is very cute and isn't too bad to watch over and over like my daughter loves to do. The humor is intelligent and cute, and it sends a good message."
5,Cars DVD,"My wife has been looking for this Blu Ray DVD for sometime, but all of the outlets have not reduced their price. Therefore, we surfed the internet at Amazon and found a seller who was selling it for a discount. We immediately purchased the DVD and are thoroughly enjoying it in Blu Ray."
4,"THE WORST OF PIXAR, BEST OF ANYTHING ELSE","As much as I try to like this movie, I find very hard making any kind of connection with the car characters. I doubt too many people have ever looked at their vehicle as something with a life of its own, unlike with their toys (or even bugs for that matter). I also can't avoid noticing the similarity to another movie, Doc Hollywood, which by the way, was truly mediocre.That said, the Pixar excelence is present here and there's is no denying they got the most out of this story. I just don't think it was that good a premise to begin with."
5,Great Family Movie,This is a really good movie. Great for the family. My husband and I enjoyed as much as our 2 year old!!!
5,Great movie!! Stunning picture!!!,"A previous reviewer has said enough about the movie itself (it's a great movie) and the special features. I want to talk about picture quality. Anyone with a Blu-ray player and an HDTV, knows how good movies look in high definition. I've owned a Blu-ray player (PlayStation 3 120 GB) and and HDTV (Samsung LN46B630 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color) for several years now and I have dozens of Blu-ray movies. Cars is simply stunning in Blu-ray, hands down it is one of the best movies to watch on Blu-ray. The picture quality is seriously jaw dropping."
2,product does not work properly,The DVD looked like it was in pretty good shape upon original purchase but it skipped a lot in the DVD player. Not a great experience.
2,Just Didn't Do It For Me,"And I'm really sorry to say it. I love nearly anything Disney, and the same goes for Pixar. As an adult writing this for other adults, this may be less a review, and more of a bewildered diatribe. I wish I could put my finger on it exactly what was missing here. It just didn't seem to have the magic of Toy Story 1 or 2, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. I also loved A Bug's Life. However, Monsters Inc. kind of fell flat for me as well. The voice acting in Cars from Owen Wilson and Paul Newman was serviceable, to be sure. The animation was top notch as well. There is just something missing with the heart of the movie. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this one, but if you are looking for the the sweet, heartwarming type of movie as the ones I previously mentioned, look elsewhere. Children, however, will probably not miss the absent sense of wonder."
5,Extrordinary Movie!,"My husband is a car enthusiast. We missed this movie at the theatre. I knew he really wanted to see it, so I bought it for him as a stocking stuffer. He was delighted! The movie is extrordinary! It's not just for kids! There is much more to see in the movie that the movie itself, just keep you eyes open and you'll see what I mean."
5,Always a feel good movie,It has become a classic in its own time. As new and exciting an idea as what The Lion King was when it was released.
5,Box Office Speaks for Itself,"If you haven't watched ""Cars,"" do. It's clever, fun, redemptive, silly, wholesome. One viewing, and you'll understand the hype. I bought this for my grandson's 4th birthday because he wore the first one out. I'm thinking of buying one for myself. It's that good."
4,Cars,"The good: plays perfectly in my Blu-Ray and computer.The bad: No alternate audio, no subtitles, no menu... I did not know the movies purchased through these type of services were lacking these features."
5,Movie with a heart,"I have a four yr old little boy who loves all kinds of trucks and cars. He could give you the names of all his vehicles long before he could identify his colors. So when we saw the movie trailers for ""Cars"" on the computer, I knew that we needed to get this one. As one of his Christmas gifts it is quickly becoming his new, all-time favorite. It takes the self-centered racing car, Lightning McQueen and side-tracks him in a sleepy old town that the interstate by-passed. During his week of community service, he makes friends and finds out that there is more to life than living in the fast lane. It is a wonderful movie and well worth watching it over and over as four year olds love to do."
1,Poor Quality,"Seller said the moive was in ""very good condition"" but it skipped and had a TON of scratches on the back. the moive itself (from what we could see) was good but I would never buy from the seller again."
1,DVD does not seem original,"Very slow delivery compared to other DVD I purchased at same time. Asian copy, have to select English from the language list. No booklet inside like other NEW DVD's. Plays ok so far."
5,"Great, Non-Violent Movie",Our whole family loves this movie. It is great for kids because there is no violence and there is humor for both the children and adults to enjoy. My only complaint is that there are some parts which drag out and could have been taken out to keep the movie under two hours.
4,I liked it.,Watched this with a toddler. The movie did not capture his attention and keep it. He got bored with this movie about half way through. It is probably meant for an older audience. I enjoyed the cars in the movie and the moral of the story was a good one too.
5,Unexpectedly entertaining and with a great message!,"The first few minutes of CARS I thought to myself, ""Another boring kids' movie I have to sit through."" I am not a big NASCAR fan and it seemed like the racing just went on and on. Then the leading car of the film, ""Lightning McQueen"", anxious to make it to California for THE BIG RACE, finds himself stuck in an old town off of Route 66. From that point on I was hooked. This is my favorite Pixar/Disney film, in fact one of the top ten films I saw all year (2006). I love all the characters and fell in love again with Paul Newman playing an old Hudson Hornet! It had a wonderful message for kids and adults. I think I might even become a NASCAR fan! I am definitely a ""Cars"" fan!!"
4,sent in error,I ordered Cars 2 and got this movie instead. It hasn't been viewed. It will be returned.That's all to say about it
5,Nice movie for the whole family,"My two year old son especially loved ""Cahs!"" The story is good and entertaining. Now I have to deal with ""More Cahs!"""
4,Another Great Pixar Flick,"Pixar has a knack for churning out movies that are great for kids, but also amusing enough that adults can enjoy them too. Cars is another great example of this.As well, I recommend that you check out the special features and the mini documentary on Route 66. Fascinating tale of a bygone era that inspired a lot of the art of the movie."
1,Worst. Pixar. Film. Ever (but kids will love it),"Over the past years I've seen and loved every Pixar film. When this originally came out, it just didn't look interesting to me. However, since Cars 2 is coming out, I thought I should finally watch this. I should have stayed with my initial feelings. This is the stupidest Pixar film ever. It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds. There's nothing for the adult viewer here. The average Chevron commercial has a more entertaining story. This movie is literally sleep-inducing. But little kids who like mindless zooming things will love it."
4,Cars,I bought this for my kids for Christmas.I enjoyed this movie on DVD. I saw it over the summer on the Cape and it was just as good as I remembered.
2,RIP OFF !!!,"Thumbs DOWN! I bought this for the ""A Change Would Do You Good"" video. But where the hell is the Heather Matarazzo version? It had Ellen DeGeneres and Molly Shannon in it also. Instead were given a boring one camera shot of Crow lip syncing in the middle of a street! No wonder it was only $9.99. Pick it up used for less."
2,One of the most confusing books I've read,"It's unbelievable how confusing a fluid mechanics book can be. Tritton achieved to present fluid mechanics in a way that only mathematicians (with usually no interest in fluid mechanics) can comprehend. If you need to really understand fluid mechanics and not to continuously deal with divergences and curls, better look for another book."
5,Top Quality and Low Cost,"This is one of the best radios available for the price. The radio is made of good quality materials like older radios. The reception is superb. The main thing that impressed me with the radio is the sturdiness of the buttons. You do not have to worry about the radio being turned off accidently by the slightest bump like most of the new push button models. If you are looking for old fashioned quality, buy it."
2,It Works...mostly,"Reception is poor, but I can jog with it without being too distracted by the signal quality. I wouldn't plan to enjoy a symphony on it though, nor would I use it if I was really listening to it as opposed to just using it as background."
1,Don't bother. You're constantly trying to tune in a your station,"This radio has a very weak tuner. I finally just threw it away and bought a radio with a digital tuner. I can't believe that anyone could get good results with this radio. Maybe they live in a small town with only one radio station and a strong signal. I had so much interference, it was ridiculous. I was always tweaking the station I was listening to to get a good signal. Digital tuners are the only way to go for these small radios and no real antenna."
2,good design,The design is great and the fit is good. Only problem is the reception was poor in my area. So basically it now sits unused
1,Bad reception,"Bought this to use at the gym, but could only get reception for one of the gym's television stations - and that one was not a clear signal. I tried it at another gym and the signal was worse there than at the first. Now it's in my give away pile and I'm shopping for a portable radio with good reception."
4,just great,"this thing is just great, it is exactly like what I want. it works well outdoors and also fine indoors. If you are familiar with tuning radio by yourself, you can get along well with it. and I even connect it to a set of speaker, the sound volume can go really high, and that is great!"
3,good pound cake...expected more rum,"It wasn't bad, just wasn't great and not very rummy. I am not sure why it was rated so high."
3,"OK, but bland","Note that this item is NOT a fruit cake, and although claimed to be a rum cake, you will need a very sensitive palate to detect any rum. This is a moist, decently textured pound cake, with next to know extras. It isn't bad, but considerably overpriced, and not nearly as exciting as its description."
3,A great product if you don't want to make yourself.,I thought it was great. I prefer to make it myself then I can adjust the recipe as I see fit. I guess I expected so much more from reading all the reviews and seeing it on Foodtv and I thought I have got to try it.
3,Not as good as Fantasicakes Rum Cake,"This cake was just ok. It's a bit too soggy and for the price, it runs very small. I much prefer the rum cake from Fantasicakes I ordered last month. You get so much more cake, so much more flavor. The quality is easy to see and taste. Tortuga has great packaging, so I love the box more then anything. But I'm not buying this cake for it's packaging, And for me, it just didn't live up to the hype. Tortuga is good, not great."
1,Horrible,"Please, do not waste your money on this game. It is horrible. There is no variety of play. The characters all play the same with no variation. The fields all play the same. All teams are equal. ...but the absolute worst aspect of this game is that there is no ending."
2,"Nice to have fresh black pepper, not so nice to have salt in your salad...","I got this because most of the others had crap reviews. Well, this one is crap too. It holds both pepper and salt and to get pepper you twist one way, salt the other. Great idea! Bad product! You end up getting both salt AND pepper when you twist, even if you ""bang it out"" after each application. This is one of those items that would have been fantastic if it had worked and I hoped so bad that it did. If you're thinking of buying this one, save your money. It's not worth the surprise of big salt crystals in your salad."
4,Better for adults than for kids,"Having fond memories of my sister's Easy-Bake oven and being a fan of cooking shows, I enjoyed thumbing through the Easy-Bake Oven Gourmet. Being rather practical, I was glad that ""Warm Memories"" recipes from past Easy-Bake oven cookbooks were included; my kids and I are more likely to try those than the more complicated recipes created by the well-known chefs. I'd agree with an earlier reviewer that Kristen Joyal's Baking with Mommy Cookbook is a better choice for families who want delicious kid-sized oven recipes that are kid-friendly in terms of ease and taste."
5,So cute!,I can't believe so many well known chefs took part in this project. So cute and practical.Good recipes even for a toaster oven.
3,Eat a cute peeping quail yes! for children no...,"Well I will have a blast with this book but my daughter asked me mommy whats a quail? I knew we were a bit out of our range with this book with the first recipe in being roasted hot mexican peppers. I was dissapointed that there was no recipe for pretzels, I remember making those as a kid? They needed more kid friendly feasts. We loved the old school photos in the book, history and the photo essay of changes through the ages with the oven.But...Then I saw the the Warm Kumquat-and-date Sticky Toffee Pudding? bleeech!"
2,UGH,Cannot figure this game out. SO FRUSTRATING. There aren't really any helpful sites either since it's such an old game.
5,A must read for every catholic and...,"Mary Ann Collins Book Catholicism Unveiled is a must read for every catholic and for anyone interested in the catholic Church. It is very important to challenge our assumptions and our doctrine's and see if they stand up to the clean teaching of Christ and his Apostle's in the New testament. Collins explores the ecumenical strategy of the catholic Church (since Vatican II) and shows us where its leading. She also takes on many of our beliefs that have been added in over the years, she examines where they come from and if they are Biblical or not. This book really is a challenge to every catholic and non catholic alike, to examine our faith, to test the spirits, and see and cleave to what is good and discard what is not. More importantly, this book is a call to all to have a personal relationship with our Lord."
4,Definite help!,"A friend of mine is using it to help teach me Spanish, I love it and how it breaks everything down. Just wish it had a little dictionary in the back."
2,"RustShaker - It says Metal, not Stainless Steel","I've now had this set for about four years, and I will now be throwing them out.I want to preface my review by saying I love the look and appearance of this set. I very much like the pepper mill, full stop.However, the salt shaker has almost completely rusted through, where corrosion appears both inside and outside of it.Now, it doesn't claim to be stainless steel, but now I know why this element is important."
3,Well Made but Lacking,Shelf is well made & attractive but... for the price the manufacturer could and should have 4 small brackets w/ predrilled holes that would lock the shelves together eliminating the need to glue before hanging. Also a wider variety of hanging hardware should be included to cover different hanging situations (2 screws is all that is included) - Not much to except with the $60 price tag. Shelves would be 5 star with these improvements.
3,not helpfull,"So, I Took this book in my trip to morocco.maps are absolutely terrible, I've been always lost. and in this book is information only of CTM Buses, not Supratour and it is notcomfortable. also, they misses some main sights in Fez, rabat, meknes.So, it is not ""perfect"" book for solo traveler"
2,Your standard arcade beat-em-up with a midieval flavor,"This is a side scrolling arcade beat-em-up game along the lines of Double Dragon. You start by selecting one of three knights and then proceed into King Arthur's world to beat bad guys, knights, collect gold and save damsels. This is NOT a roleplaying game. There is not too much new here, other than the theme is set in medieval times! The big thing about the game is a challenge, but arcade games are meant to eat your quarters. Cool graphics though, two players simultaneous. If you love arcade beat-em-ups and need to try something different, this game is for you!"
3,"great body, poor saul","Great hardware but daddy sony pushes you around with its choices. It starts with a disk formatted only like they want, overflowing with sony useless utilities. It seems impossible to reconfigure it and if you ask them they tell you to keep quiet that they know better than you what you want. Don't even bother to ask to install win2000 you are so used to and know already, it's impossible, the needed drivers are not available.The best is that it doesn't come with a recovery CD, if you want it you have to purchase it from sony at 25$"
5,Keeps my old cats spry,"Keeps my old cats spry and getting around well, in spite of advanced age and arthritis."
3,just as they said,it was delivered on time and in brand new condition as promised but its not that different from a recorder. My recommendation don't bother with an irish tin whistle cause its just a recorder with a fancy name.
4,Good overall,"This is pretty good overall, but squeaks easily on the C sharp. Still, easy to learn on, which is what I wanted it for."
5,Excellent whistle at a great price,"This is just a great whistle at a great price. I am utterly new to playing this instrument and was able to get a great sound out of it easily the first time I picked it up. I am extremely pleased with it. It requires very little care to keep in perfect condition. I love the beautiful green paint job, which doesn't get nicked or scuffed and has a pretty sort of shimmer to it. The whistle has a sweet, mellow sound. It being in the key of D really helps if you're trying to play traditional folk music on it. If you're just starting out with a tin whistle and want a nice one to get started (and like the color green) this is the one to pick up."
2,Okay but it was damaged badly but the seller made good on it.,It is useful but not just what I had hoped for. But the seller was very honest.
1,Used on one trip,"Used this on one trip in a rental car running one laptop computer with GPS running. Blew the car fuse after 30 minutes, so my GPS went down. Also the Inverter has a cooling fan that is pretty loud."
3,Use your brain!,"For brainiacs and people that love puzzles, this is a five star game, for those who love action and shooting games, you will get bored after the first few levels. You are Krusty the Klown and your funhouse has been overrun by rats! So you must go on five levels and around 40 stages killing them all in fun ways. Not killing them by shoting them, killing them by setting paths from the mice to where they go into a rat trap. Putting down blocks to make stairs so they go up to a trap or putting them in jars and releasing them near a trap. But there are other hazards along the way to stop Krusty, like giant snakes and birds and you must kill them with either cream pies or super bouncy balls."
5,Awesome Thongs!!!,"These might be the best thongs I've ever owned. They are so very comfortable and have endured LOTS of abuse since I got them. I've worked on the house and in the yard in them, gone dancing in them, and just recently I hiked 6 miles over sharp and bumpy lava fields on the Big Island in these thongs. They got a little frayed along the edges but otherwise performed amazingly for such a technical hike over a very unforgiving surface. If I could change anything about them, it would be to thin them out a bit so they'd look more streamlined and fashionable. Other than that, they're awesome and I highly recommend them."
5,The BEST EVER!,These have been the best flip flops I've found by far!! so much cushion!!!And long lasting I've had mine over two years - they are fantastic!!
1,Just another Thai-English language guide,Nothing new in this book.Guide for sounds was weak at best.
1,Holdsworth fans should look elsewhere,"Over excited funk rhythms and jerky unconnected soloing make this record too exasperating a record to bother writing a longer review. Holdsworth sounds like he was woken up from a drugged sleep and starts fretting about desperately, like someone who was supposed to be working rather than catching some zzzz's."
4,What a fool I was!,"I didn't have any problem to get this (Nowadays it is hard to find). Some years ago, I found it at a record shop and bought it (the first time was easy). But I sold it after a couple of years. For very stupid reason; I have & enjoy many of Allan's recordings. My favorites are UK (Debut album), Gazeuse! (Gong) and his own solo album-Metal Fatigue. I was kind of afraid of having 'less-fantastic' Allan Holdsworth album. Strange, huh? Anyway, I sold it for that reason. Overall, it wasn't fantastic album indeed but yeah, right, I have been bumping my head to any wall around me and miss that three beautiful acoustic pieces. If you find it, grab it. Do sell it as a fool did. Some say his compositions are 'boring' and lack groove. Maybe. But I think we should see him playing live to fully appreciate his playing. First of all, if he wants, he can compose and play lovely tunes as much as he wants."
2,Too old to listen...,"This is a boring TUll album, full of acustic guitars. Also, Anderson's voice is almost unbearable here."
2,Backpack ripped at seams within less than a year,"This is a generally good bag except durability, which is for me a pretty important quality. I've had it less than a year, and don't even use it every day (I work from home) and it's already got a tear in the seam and the zippers get caught quite a bit. I am already seeking a new backpack and will avoid this brand going forward."
5,Got it from RadioShack for $19.99,"Was on clearance and I also picked up a 2 year extended warranty for only $1.00 Very nice Backpack, lightweight and durable, roomy for enough books, notes and my laptop and still not bulky."
5,Excellent Travel backpack,"Its a great product with a resonable price. Its a great travel tool especially when you lot of accessories along with computer and a typical notebook case is not sufficient. Comfortable shoulder pads, lots of pockets (i.e. 2 front 1 rear and two side pockets). Its pretty durable material. Am very happy with the product. For people on small budget it's best deal !!!"
2,Disappointment,"Bought the backpack a couple of month ago, fabric is starting to fray, could not be less water resistant, waterbottle pocket is absolutely useless, much too short for anything other than those tiny waterbottles, everything else falls out. The most disappointing part has been the lack of padding. Yes it has a padded compartment for the laptop but its no thicker than a layer of fleece, especially on the bottom, leaving you wincing everytime you place it on the ground and feel it thud."
2,Targus Groove notebook backpack is not durable,"The Targus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpack was the corporate issue laptop bag at a large company i worked for. The IT department had a huge pile of broken backpacks of this model, mostly with the same problem--fraying and ripping where the straps attach to the top of the bag. Mine had the same problem after about two years of daily commuting.The bag can hold a lot but has inadequate support, concentrating weight across the shoulders instead across the back. The straps are poorly padded and there's not much room for airflow for your back.Padding for the computer is minimal, just half-centimeter thick padding. If you load up the bag, your laptop will get crushed."
3,Okay for the price,"As the adage goes, you get what you pay for. That's definitely the case for this bag. While sturdy, it's not as comfortable as I'd hope, and there's not a good distribution of weight. However,theTargus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpackdoes have ample compartments for additional gadgets. Just not enough padding for me. The Pegasus by SwissGear is much better, but it will cost you more."
4,Roomy and cheap,"Have used one for half an year now.Pros: cheap, reliable, very room, plenty of pockets, fits a 15.4 well.Cons: could some extra padding between the back and the laptop, and not just between the laptop and the rest of the contents."
3,"Good, But but not as expected... :(","I was searching for a bag pack for my dell studio 14, as it is a delicate piece, i needed a good bag pack, so I gone with targus rather than lenevo. My friend bought lenevo bag pack just for 14 bux, and I paid double price to get quality, but guess what, I was dumped by targus this time... I mean its good but not as expected... cheap quality chains, and less sponge used. there is no sponge inside the laptop deck. I am very upset. But still its very light in weight and pretty comfortable than my older one(american tourister)... I think I will be used to it soon."
4,As expected,"This backpack looks as good as it is. I was glad to see that it had space for more than just my laptop supplies. Shipped and arrived on time, no complaints so far."
3,Worth the price,"It's inexpensive - that's the good part.Not much padding for the computer. Not the best backpack, but if your main concern is price it will get the job done."
3,average,i found this product to be average while compared to any other products which are available in the market.
5,Excelente producto,"Muy buen producto, espacioso, material increíblemente protector, ideal para el trabajo color ejecutivo. En fin, un excelente bolso. No me arrepiento de la compra, gracias."
3,Not designed for a woman,"I like the bag for the amount of space it holds and the cost. The major downside of this bag is that it doesn't stay on both shoulders. They are designed for a more broad person (I am assuming a man), and there isn't a chest strap I can use to compensate for this. I am a medium build woman, and the bag is often only able to stay on one shoulder at a time."
4,Targus Groove Backpack Case - Should have more space,"I bought this bag on March 23rd, had it about a week after.It was exactly like in the pictures! It has room for my laptop, my DVD burner,my external Hard Drive, my flash drives, and my Blackberry.I thing this is a great bag, really but for someone like me who's a techno lover, its just too small! I didn't think I wouldn't have room for my other gadgets (a Kindle,another Hard Drive, my headphone with microphone, my ipod and my Nokia smartphone!). This is my mistake.But I got to say that it is solid and it's designed so that when I travel with all my stuff (and that happens a lot!) it seems like its lightweight!I love this backpack for another reason, it isn't common! Since I had it, I only seen 3 people (includind myself) with it! Not like some others you see everywhere you go, and increases the risk of accidentally take somebody else's.En resumé, I can say that I would recommend this to a third party."
5,A GREAT ITEM,"This bag is wonderfull. I used it on vacation and it accomadated my laptop,books,digital camera, personal items....so much space!!!"
1,When I deliver the product,"Good Afternoon, I can say when I give the product a month ago I bought and I have not yet delivered"
3,great looking bag.,well i just got this bag in the mail from ups. just today 8/10/2010it's a little small but it fit's my laptop really well. i havent used it yet. but for all the reviews that i read about this bad. sounded good before i ordered the bag. it looks really nice but that all that i know right now... i heard its a really good back for the price.. it should work just fine for me cuse i really only put my laptop and charger in the bags. nothing esle really.
3,Cheap price... cheap product,"Please, don't waste your money in this article... You better want to spend a few more dollars in a product that looks y feels better...NOT THAT I EXPECTED for a Targus product..."
5,Tough stuff,"In 2006 I bought my first Targus backpack (looks like this one, but with some extra pockets and compartements) and I loved it: it was so spacious and the material and zippers are strong. Backpack is washable and very durable. I could load almost everything in it, and I took it to all trips. Though Targus backpacks don't look stylish they are ready to any tough job. These are definitely one of the best backpacks in the market."
4,Backpack works for me.,"Very well made backpack. Protects my laptop for travel. Could have a little more padding around the laptop, but it works for me. Lots of pockets for accessories. Nice padded shoulder straps, plus a strap around my waist to hold it securely. I use it to carry on airplane when traveling."
5,A must for any Science Fiction Fan!,"As a complete fan of the show I cannot tell you how important these two movies are - watch them - buy this dvd! Darren McGavin is a wonderful actor who imbues Kolchak with a sense of courage, honesty, and goodness. Yes he is a unusual characer and that is why we all love him... this guy could be your uncle, dad, or quirky neighbor. The supporting characters in these movies are absolute gems as well. The Night Stalker is just scary - the vampire is creepy because we can see much humanity in him. The Night Stangler has a very human nemesis - who wants immortality at any cost...I don't want to give the plots away just watch it.Personally I cannot wait for the entire series to come out of dvd - that would be a wonderful way to share with these kids that have never seen the show or the two movies. In short no one should be without this great 70's tv movies."
4,Brilliant films,"Even though the actors have cheesy 70's style clothes and hairdos the movies (especially The Night Strangler) don't seem too dated today. I admit they are brilliant films but equally so was the The Night Stalker series that followed. There is consistency between the two films and the tv series as Kolchak has self-describably gone from Las Vegas to Seattle to Chicago (where the tv show's set). Conrtrived that Tony Vincenzo (his editor) follows him in all three shows but why quibble over that flaw? But I wish in the tv show Kolchak's editor was, say, Sam Vincenzo, Tony's twin brother. Sorry, but I have to have to propose an alternate theory whenever I find fault with something."
2,Disappointing,"Poor sequal to the much superior and scarier ""Night Stalker"". As usual, the plot is rehashed with Kolchak (Darren McGavin) chasing some supernatural villian, while the cops do their Keystone imitation and Vincienzo (Simon Oakland)screams at the top of his lungs.Apparently ""Night Strangler"" was made with a low budget; the production was mostly filmed on a set and shows it. (In contrast, ""Night Stalker"" was filmed on location in Las Vegas and looks great.) The fight sequence between the cops and the villian looks so bad; I've seen more realistic fights at a WWF event.The villian is less frightening than in the first movie, probably because you never see him in anything but a trenchcoat and hat, and never get the impression that there's something supernatural about him.If you want to be scared, get the first Kolchak movie (five stars) instead and avoid this one."
4,Scary When I First Saw Them..,"Boy, does this DVD bring back memories. I remember watching this TV show on CBS way back when and it was very spooky. This DVD contains the two ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" films, one about a vampire the other about a Jack the Ripper style killer.I've seen them both many times and they are fun to watch but I liked the TV show episodes better. Kolchak is a funny character, Darren McGavin is GREAT in these movies and in the TV show (I still watch the re-runs on the Sci-Fi channel).I guarantee that you will never see anything like Kolchak: The Night Stalker on TV today (the X-Files came close but it spun out of control, this show was consistantly good), its just too original."
5,LOVE IT!,"This movie duo asks the question, ""What if?!"" and does it in a way that will please any supernatural genre lover. It did and still does deliver what TV was supposed to do; allow us a needed escape from ""reality"" for a while."
4,The Night Stalker,"Interesting movie. If vampires did exist and appeared in LA, this could be exactly the reaction of the authorities."
4,poignant story,"the story of hannah senesh is painful and inspiring. few people have heard of her--that's a shame. she was a brave, committed woman in a time of horror and cruelty. i hope others take the opportunity to learn about her short, inspiring life."
3,decent,"it is what you see. decent. plastic. has the black space between the V and the T. good adhesive. i was (and possibly you may be) looking for another product - one that is all chrome (no plastic, and nothing black)."
4,A fun read,I am applying to MBA programs now and found the book to be a fun read. I think you have to keep the time frame in perspective and realize that Mr. Robinson did not want to be in the school in the first place. I would say that if you are a poet and planning to go to business school please take some math course before hand.
2,"Informative, whiney, could be better","I bought this book along with Year One about Harvard with the goal of learning more about MBA life. Unfortunately, I read first Year One from a far superior writer that kept me engaged. Snapshots is not bad, informative, but very boring and uninspiring. You get the impression that the account was biased because the author struggled himself. Despite his hardship, I think he could have written a more balanced book, if not more interesting and more engaging. For his work as a speechwriter, I found the book to be very bland and boring. Also, it is written in time where the echoes of the 80s were still prevalent on campus. I much prefer Year One as a better account of b-school life in a top school."
2,Not believable,"When the writer quotes an Irishman saying that the Irish flag is green with a harp on it, it's not difficult to deduce that most of the rest of the book must be made-up hooey too. I'm doing an MBA - a condensed 1-year one, at that - and it's tough and it's busy, but it's not like this guy makes out."
1,Quit your B-School Bitching,"Try Law School, then we'll talk about levels of difficulty. In comparison, the first year of Business School is a joke. Compared to most things the first year of B-School is a joke."
5,"Eye Opening, Touching","This DVD is a fascinating insight into the Romanov family. The actors, especially Tsar Nicholas, were fabulous. Of course, we all know how it ends. But watching it, after understanding how kind, generous and noble the family was, made me tear up. So brutal and unjust.If you are a Romanov or a history fan, get this DVD."
2,Extremely uncomfortable but nice,This ring is very pretty but it hurt the inside of my middle and pinky fingers due to the roughness of the prongs surrounding the stones. Had to return it and take a loss on shipping.
5,I loved these videos! Ian McShane was wonderful.,"A great set of videos. I watched them, my brother borrowed them and loved them and my Mom thought they were excellent too! I wish there were more of them made and available!"
3,Not really Francis but still enjoyable.,"I bought the boxset thinking I would be watching stories by Dick Francis... well, beside some superficial similarities there is not much DF here.Still, these are relatively enjoyable episodes, made for TV mysteries. If you have your heart set on capturing the spirit of the novels you will be disappointed. However, if you just want some nice TV mysteries to watch you will enjoy these very much."
1,"Great stories, but sound and color just AWFUL!","Unfortunately, the originals were this bad, I remember their original airings on PBS. I bought this set and then returned them, that's how bad they are. (Also, Ian McShane is just WRONG for a Dick Francis hero, but that's a personal opinion.)"
4,No Lines,"I like the jar and I'm going to briefly explain why I didn't give the product a 5 Stars review. No lines, there are usually 2 lines on a gel jar, add water and full line. In other words, depending on the size of the crystals (shrinkage)you add distilled water. No biggie, if you don't know when to add water, google it or watch a brief video on youtube. Other than that I'm happy with the product and its price."
1,Found mold inside after less than a month,"I found black colored mold inside the jar after less than a month of use. I don't care how the humidity is if it's putting mold in my cigars, it's got to go."
2,Not sure if...,"I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what, but this didn't work very well for me. Lost humidification in a ZIPLOCK BAG in less than a week and a half."
1,"This might offer great 70% humidity, I'll never know.","I ordered this product a while ago. I had been told that I'd receive a pack of cigars and a humidor for my birthday. I ordered this as soon as I received the humidor. The cigars were following by about a week. This incredible crystal gel product shipped by usps and I got a nice note saying that it was COD and I could go to the post office and get it for .62c, not happening. I'm using the humidifier that came with the humidor and it's sticking around 65% humidity, I'll find a smoke shop soon and eat the $5 I paid for what may be a great product from the useless shipping department of Premier Cigar Humidors."
1,Don't fit like stated.,"These are nice thick rubber but they are not made to the contour of my vehicle....the 'see if it fits' feature says it does fit, and it does fit if you don't mind curled up rubber around the edges."
5,The Effection rocks!!,"The Effection is a great band-- if you live in the Bay Area, their live show is a must-see...-------------""Soundtrack to a Moment is, top to bottom, one the finest power pop albums to come out in years. Bouchard and his pals are unabashed pigs for harmonizing, which, when welded to the chassis of their punk background, makes for some pretty cathartic stuff. Forget all the buzzwords like genuine and sincerity that are tossed around to keep power pop down in its cult ghetto, and you'll more likely than not find yourself wondering why a song like ""Agony"" shouldn't be on the charts. Here's to hoping for better days.""--- John O'Neill, San Francisco Bay Guardian"
5,The one the right and left don't want you too read,Slightly neurotically written but the truth hits them hard. Like the George Washington Blog this one is revealing and hurtful.
1,Between Boyfriends,"If you want to learn how to become a sleep-around sleeze-ball (easy comes to mind, so does VD), buy this book."
3,Buy this if you DON'T watch Sex & The City,"Why? Because if you watch S&TC, this book is basically that show but in book format. Remember, the author is the writer/executive producer (one of them) of that show. So, while reading it, you'll have flashbacks to episodes and say to yourself, ""Oh yeah, Samantha/Miranda/Charlotte/Carrie said that."" If you don't watch the show, you'll read the book and find that Chupack's book has its funny moments. This is a pretty quick read, and because of that, you MIGHT want to consider if you want to spend your money on this short of a book."
4,As fun as TV if you don't take tv too seriously,"I enjoyed this book. The tone and perspective are pitch perfect with Sex and the City, so I guess a fan of the show would enjoy them. Except the stories are personal and in a way maybe their simpler. But always honest and funny, and that's whats important."
2,Didn't care for it...,"Unlike the other reviewer who did not finish the book, I actually did even though I wanted to stop. I've always hated when people leave reviews when they haven't actually finished the book not to mention that their facts are wrong. Marke never actually moved in with Claymore she was a houseguest of Sitter, a woman that lived at his house.I really disliked the title of this book. It didn't really make any sense to me. I'm wondering who's supposed to be the Beauty & whose is supposed to be the beast? Marke (yes, the female) is described as not being a beauty & she's certainly not a beast. And, I hated the names in this book: Marke (the main female), Lord Perfect (come on now), Heaven (a man's name), & Sitter (yeah, it was short for a last name but still...). That's really not a big deal but I just didn't like it.Aside from my nitpicking I just really didn't like the story & I never got to like the characters. Sorry to say but I can't recommend this book."
1,aah!,"So, I'll warn you straight off: I have not finished this book. But it's only because I can't stomach it. It's one of those books where you know what will happen, not just because you're smart like that, but because you are all but told! I can't wrap my mind around the hero's petulance or the heroine's naivete. I mean, who really just up and moves in with a random stranger? Who does that? No, really! It just doesn't seem genuine, you know?"
5,Beautiful use of the English language!,"No, no, no to the reviewer who wants this condensed down to 60 pages!! This book is beautifully written and gives the reader glimpses into three cultures: American, German, and Native American. To omit the backgrounds of the main characters would be similar to holding a skeleton in our hands.The language is beautiful, the setting is raw and beautiful, the characters are bold and beautiful. I laughed, I wept, and I came away from the book remembering bits and pieces with gratitude. This was my first Kent Meyers book, but I will be reading more.To those of you lucky people living near Sioux Falls, SD, I understand that Kent Meyers is one of the authors at this weekend's book festival.....how I wish I could attend."
5,Great Story and Beautiful Writing,"Meyer's book is easily one of the most engaging works of fiction I have ever read. People who have read the book at my recommendation have returned with enthusiastic responses of their own. I can't quite name it, but this book has a quality of spirituality and humanity that emerges from Meyer's committment to his characters and the circumstances and human responses that make up their lives. He has a way of evoking their inner worlds, the unnamed movements of the human spirit, and in the process sheds light on our common humanity. It may take place in the landscape of South Dakota, but its scope is large enough to include the Third Reich, Native American culture and experience, and the committed but fading world of farmers and ranchers on the western plains. It is a work rooted in myth and symbol, where what you think you see may in fact be something quite different. This is a compassionate book by a writer of distinction and talent."
2,"Had Promise, But Too Slow...","This book has a great story underlying itself. Without spoiling it for you, the conflict of the horses and the dialogue among the character is intriguing, and at times, hilarious. Mr. Meyers truely captures certain Native American linguistics and charm.Unfortunately, he strays from the story and the dialogue FAR, FAR too often. The reader will be captivated by the action or the dialogue (or both) and then suddenly we will be forced to read about the history and culture of Native Americans (and also the Germans). Which is fine, but he places these excessively numerous bits of tedium throughout the novel in places they just don't belong.For the first time ever, I skipped paragraph over paragraph of useless rhetoric just to get to the next line of dialogue.Quite simply: Compress this book into 60 pages and you have a hell of a read."
1,Very very useless book,This book is so elementary and it must be taught at kindergarden instead of learning something such as a Dynamic Modeling.....
1,Terrible..Product was expired...Don't Buy !!,We received product on July 13th 2012....and it expired in June 2012. Quit selling expired products !! Buyer beware !!!
4,Great for Kids!!!,"This game is pretty fun, as are other Mickey games. It's great for younger kids and still good for older ages as well. The graphics and music and sounds in this game are just simply awesome. I reccommend this game for anyone who has kids. It's a great way to spend some time with your kid, and they'll love it!"
4,Good but needs more,"The idea of matching your personality to a type of business is a great one. I could quibble with some of the books categories and the like but one should view it as a starting place to get you thinking going. Any advice about finding an idea or running a business is missing however or very very weak. Personally I foundThe Balanced Entrepreneura much better read, containing some similar ideas, but many many more tips."
3,The second reviewer got it right.,I must agree with the second review that several of the best songs in the film were NOT in the film. The remake of Michael Jackson's SMOOTH CRIMINAL was a great tune AND in one of the funniest scenes in the movie. You would've thought it would be in the soundtrack. Also the last song heard at the big party was not on there. I hope Universal is looking or being shown this and the other review. I would be nice if they could release a better soundtrak like they have been with the different versions of AMERICAN PIE on DVD.
2,Lacking the best songs in the entire movie,"Ok hands down, this movie was a total riot! I swear I was going piss in my pants I was laughing so hard. And the music IN the movie was awesome!! Unfortunately, the best songs IN the movie (Sum 41 - In too Deep & Michelle Branch - Everywhere) were not on the soundtrack. And as much as I would like to give the soundtrack a good rating due to a great movie, I would be lying through my skin."
2,Great Movie but the sound track could've been better,"There's a few good songs. Blink 182 - good track, 3 Doors Down - good track, Sum 41 - good track, Green Day - good track. They left out the best tune from one of the funniest scenes in the movie, ""Smooth Criminal"" by Alien Ant Farm. This is the most memorable tune from the whole movie. It's a shame they left off."
2,wheres the rest of it,"This is a pretty good cd, but why dont movies inclued all the tracks people hear? Jesus Christ, there are only 15 songs, where are all the others?"
2,What the...,"OK, pretty much every song used in American Pie 2 was generic and suffering from radio overplay. But there was ONE song that stood out from the bunch -- Alien Ant Farm's cover of Micheal Jackson's Smooth Criminal (which, BTW, is now getting lots of airplay as well). This is the song that played while our hero was running around with his hand glued down his pants, looking for paint thinner.But for some reason, the hack in charge of compiling this CD apparently decided to eliminate this song (and substituted it with a different AAF track that I don't even remember hearing in the movie). WHY?! What a dumbass decision! DON'T buy this CD if that's the song you were looking for. Instead, go out and buy Alien Ant Farm's Anthology CD."
3,NEED HELP FOR THE NAME OF THE SONG/ARTIST,Can anybody tell me the name of the song/artist in the movie that immediately plays right AFTER Sum 41 - In Too Deep.This song plays for while the movies shows the different couples on different beds...thanks
1,Missing all the best,The sound score really contributed to the appeal of this movie. Numerous scenes were so perfectly complimented by the choices of songs; I was very impressed.So why did none of the GOOD songs end up on this CD?
3,I found the name of a song people were looking for...,"I searched high and low and found the ""I feel fantastic, boombastic...song"" that was playing after Bridget was walking home from work on her birthday to cook her friend the blue soup.It's called ""Woman Trouble"" by Artful Dodger. ENJOY!"
3,What is the Name of That Song?????????,Near the End of the movie right after in too deep by sum 41 when they are all asleep in bed?
3,What is the Name of That Song?????????,"What is the name of the song that is played right after the end of summer party ends, and after In Too Deep by Sum 41 called. They are all lying in bed......."
5,My Very Own Lullaby...,I fall asleep to this CD every night...I especially like the ending of the first segment which is within the first 3-5 minutes. The only problem is that sometimes I fall asleep before it gets there - it is that good! The purity of Gordon Hempton's sounds are magnificent.
3,Everyone here is crazy,"Well...maybe not crazy. But, no one seems capable of playing well with others. So, what's the real scoop? The only conclusion our book club came up with was that this young adult novel can be read by either girls or boys with equal pleasure, or disdain. The reader, however, is left holding the question bag. Who exactly was the beneficient founder of the feast? What was really his motivation? Was he a total psycho? Did he create the clues before Pennyman was torched? Why did he risk the life and limb of a high school student and companion? Was Rose Tourette magical? Did Rose Tourette eat the benefactor? Heck! I don't know! There is no sequel. Some readers might prefer a more precise resolution."
1,they are....drop dead,THESE THINGS ARE ****TERRIBLE******* LOOK AT THEIR FACE! THEY MUST BLIND TO WEAR THAT SHADE OF LIP GLOSS! WHAT A SHAME! WHAT AN INSULT!TROLLZ ARE MORE THAN THAT!I BET THAT THEY DID NOT MAKE BOYS BECAUSE THEY WOULD DROP DEAD IF THEY WRER 10 FT. AWAY FROM THEM!OMG!-al
1,THIS is not a troll.,"A Troll does not resemble a deformed human with pointy ears.A Troll also is not a 'hip and cool teen!OMG!'.A Troll is a lovably ugly little creature,deep tan in color,with big eyes,a long shock of bright colored hair and a jewel in it's tummy.These dolls are officially renamed Elvez."
5,Amethyst Trollz Doll,"I just love this doll! It is so much fun to comb it's hair.The outfits are cool too!My teacher lets me bring my doll to class. She even has one. Some of the boys play with them too.I started a Trollz Club in my classroom. Now, we have 8 Trollz in our class!"
3,better than foam by far,"I use this puck as a adjustment to large humidors. my primary source of humidity is nano beads, and I have one of these gel puck in each box as well. they work for about a year and occasionally discolor, but for 8 bucks & free freight they're not bad. I've found that they need to be recharged ever 3-4 weeks."
1,THIS IS NOT FOR ANYONE OVER 3,This toy is NOT for anyone over age 3 and the maker of the toy should not advertise it for anyone over that age. The only 6 year old that could ride this would be a midget. It's no larger than a tricycle. If I could give it a rating less than 1 I would do that. I am so digusted. I am so glad my husband put it together before Christmas Eve or else this review would have been much worse. Needless to say it is in the box and will be shipped back tomorrow.
1,Problems with charger,"I had purchased the 19.2 V Kawasaki 840131 cordless drill and I couldn't use it because the charger was defected. When I send the charger back they sent me another bad one, I only charged one battery and it wouldn't work again. I am not very happy with this product."
3,Well worth the money,"I replaced an older Craftsmen 14.4 with this Kawasaki. The price was great for a 19.2 drill with two batteries and a 1/2 inch chuck, so I took a risk on the off brand. It is pretty well made despite having no metal at all on the chasis and has all the torgue you would expect. the only draw back is that it is made in China and nowhere does it specify that on Amazon. I was trying to buy a drill made anywhere but China, but that seems impossible to do for under $100 - just so you know. One other thing to consider is weight. This is a very heavy drill. I can't imagine working overhead with it for more than 10 minutes or so."
5,Sheer quality,"I'd been waiting for what seemed like an age for this series to come to dvd and this boxset is exactly what I was after. The series covers a wide range of moments spanning multiple sports in a set that's sure to suck you in. I don't think even being a die hard sports fan is necessary because the way the moments are presented they're a story in themselves. I can't recommend the series or this set highly enough. Do yourself a favor and check it out, you'll be glad you did."
4,Cool gift for sport fans or not..,"I got this for my bf's b-day and he is big sport and espn.com fan. he popped it in his ps3 as soon as he opened it. i actually watch one of the disc with him and even though i'm not a sport fan at all, i admit i enjoyed it myself. it was pretty interesting and my bf really enjoyed it too. he also really like the cap it comes it. i recommend this gift for all men....or women sport fans too."
3,ELTON JOHN-CONTINUES BOX SET,"I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BOX SET. IT HAS ALOT OF HITS. BUT WERE DID MCA GET THE MASTERS FOR THIS SET. ON DISC 1, (2) SONGS HAVE DROP OUTS IN THE RECORDING, DANIEL IS A RUFF CUT NOT SMOOTH AS I HEARD ON A 2-TRACK MASTER DONE BY STEVE HOFFMAN. DISC 2. NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. DISC 3. PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM AND ISLAND GIRL COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER. DISC 4. IM STILL STANDING RUFF CUT, NOT SMOOTH AND ACT OF WAR, TURN IT UP LOAD DESTORTION, LIKE IT WAS,NT REMASTERED BUT MASTERED INSTEAD. I OWN A FEW MCA RECORDINGS THAT WERE REMASTERED. A FEW OF THEM DONT SOUND AS GOOD REMASTERED AS THEY SHOULD BE. IT COST MONEY TO GET A PERFECT SOUND. IT'S BEST TO DEAL WITH AN IMPORT CD. YOU MIGHT GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH."
1,Waste of time and money.,"I would rate this book 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me.Figuring out that Russell Andrews is a pen name for two guys was the book's biggest challenge. The narrative is trash. The story is cliche. And the dialogue - who talks like this? How did this get published? The disclaimer on a pack of Marlboros is more gripping."
2,"Tried hard, too hard.","Gideon, in my eyes, was a novel that desperately tried to be young, fresh, and/or hip. It wasn't even close. The authors' use of sports slang was painful to read, and seemed to be a desperate plea to inject youth in the novel. The closer's identity was a good twist, but overall the plot was stale. I have seen it in the movie theater and have read it in other novels. I was extremely disappointed with the portrayal of the Catholic Church in this novel, the homosexual and pedophilia references were neither proper nor relevant to the story. I am not standing on a soapbox, but I hope modern authors have the talent to write a thrilling novel without employing sensationalism. I will stick with Fyodor Doestevsky. Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and Brothers Karmazov were tremendous thrillers. I guess the difference in quality is that Fyodor wasn't trying to write a novel and a screen play all at once."
1,Not the Meters at their best,"Actually, if not for ""The World is a Little Bit Under the Weather"" this recording is utterly without redemption. Buy Cabbage Alley, Rejuvenation or Fire on the Bayou instead. Struttin' and The Meters are excellent too, perhaps better than their 70's recordings; however, they are scaled-down in production (just the original four members, mostly instrumentals)."
3,Better than some,Ordered two of these for our office. I do not recommend this for speakerphone use. The phone functions fine and setup was fairly simple. The handset is very light and difficult to know if it is set back in its cradle.Room for improvement but better than my other VOIP phone.
4,Amazing,This is absolutely amazing stuff. If you like this you should check out Joe Sneva. I was up in Seattle and I saw him there. Really good acoustic music just like Bob. Check it out! www.joesneva.com
1,Caruso Steam Rollers,"I owned 4 Caruso Steam rollers, and they ALL stopped working after about 2 or 3 months. I like the idea of working with steam and not damaging your hair. However, I think they have a design flaw, do not waste your money. It is not worthed to repair , so you just throw money away."
2,disapointing,The book started out interesting and about half way through became almost science fiction.
3,"Innocence, love, friendship","A story of struggle and friendships grown out of hardships. A good, kind read."
3,A story that jumps all over,"I will admit, I didn't read every page of this book. I couldn't get into it, so I just read the Honora & Sexton sections. I loved her previous books ""The Pilot's Wife"" and ""The Last Time They Met,"" but this just didn't seem to have the same depth. I just felt there were too many sides to the story to make any sense.If you just want something quick that you may not have to finish, this is the book for you."
3,"OK - not Shreve's best by far, but not awful.","Compared to a lot of other books, this one is good. Compared to Anita Shreve's other books, like Eden Close, Strange Fits of Passion, A Change in Altitude, The Weight of Water, and even The Pilot's Wife (it's hard for me to admit I like a book that's in Oprah's Book Club, but I'll level with you), it doesn't stand out. While these other books tend to explore from many angles the complexity of their central characters - the good, the bad, the ugly, and the inexplicable - this one is more superficial, and has a fairy tail ending of sorts. However, it certainly won't hurt you to read it, and you learn a little history too, which is always good."
3,Disappointing,"""Sea Glass"" was a real disappointment to me. I eagerly look forward to Shreve's novels, but this one and her last have let me down.While exhibiting some of Shreve's usual beautiful writing, especially the descriptions of the beach area, I felt that this book never jelled. It just felt disjointed, perhaps because of the constant changes in narrators - a device I really disliked because I think it kept the story from flowing smoothly.I did not really care about many of the characters, most of whom were flat and undefined.....there were too many characters and not enough development of any of them. I found that I had absolutely no emotional investment in this book.I think a story just about Honora and Sexton's lives, maybe with Vivian as another major character, could have been a book in itself and an interesting depiction of life during the Depression.Writing this review truly saddens me because so many of Anita Shreve's books have given me such pleasure."
3,"Not Sophisticated Writing, But a Worthwhile Story","Honora and Sexton purchase a ramshackle beach house on the coast of New Hampshire in 1929, setting the stage for their financial ruin. Their lives become entwined with others involved in a strike at a textile mill in a nearby town. This is simple, not sophisticated writing, but the story will hold your attention. It's a story suitable as a beach or plane read. I give it 3 stars because if you are unfamiliar with what life was like during the Great Depression, this novel will provide you with some inkling of it's hardships."
1,Should have boarded up the place for good,"As an admirer of Anita Shreve's previous books, I couldn't wait to read her latest. While the first several chapters were strong, the story just fell apart. Fortune's Rock was great from start to finish. While I'm not looking for over developed characters, these characters just lacked depth and so did the story. Maybe it's time for Ms. Shreve to find a new locale, or this reader had better find a new author."
2,Sim City like game.,"You are god... literally in this game. The point of this game is that your blue tribe must survive and destroy the rival red tribe. You play as god, with a birds eye view of their world, and you flatten land for them to build houses and castles, and you create hazards for the rival tribes, such as floods, swamps, knights to destroy and burn their villages, and even create huge mountains from nothing. This is a good game, for the first level! But then there are around 400 levels, each with different lands, featurings deserts, snow, grass and dirt. Each level takes about an hour to three hours to complete, so it gets very boring! Also, pretty poor graphics."
5,Great Post Lamp,Lamp was heavier than I expected & well made for a product in this price range. It arrived in excellent condition.
4,Surprisingly good!,"Ah, Smartball. This was one of the first games I ever played on SuperNES. The storyline is simple. You are Jerry, a prince from some land far away. You've been transformed into a little blue ball by an enemy of yours so that he can steal your princess. The game revolves around you, Jerry the ball, trying to fight your way through several levels and become human again.Simple graphics, simple story, but a fun game that isn't age-biased. This one brings back memories of third grade and many a night spent playing Super Mario Bros., Zelda, and this game."
5,"Simple, but very entertaining.","This game is surprisingly addictive, namely because it's not an age-biased creation- anyone could find equal enjoyment out of it. Smartball consists of a little blue oval-ish ball that crawls, jumps, and swims his way through the different levels, each of which grows in difficulty the farther you advance. Now, I'm not exactly sure what the goal is, because I got it without the box and instructions, and still haven't defeated the whole game, but whatever it is it's definitely fun attempting to get there. Smartball would be a wonderfull addition to anyone who has an SNES player and is open to something other than Mario and Mortal Kombat. I myself have spent many hours glued to the TV screen while playing it, and that's saying something."
5,"This is a ""How To"" book","One quote in this book describes it very well: "" Transform the ordinary into the visible, and the visible into the highly visible"". A must read."
2,Very Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to others to read. Alot of the book was common sense and basic general reading. If you are looking to create high visability this book will not be very helpful in helping you set a plan to create high visability or anything else for that matter. The book doesnt get useful until near the end of the book.
3,Good book but the reference of his research are not valid!!!,This book is a fundamental to the Celebrity Industry!!!All Celebrities should know about that book.Nonetheless I have tried to trace the references of the book and I could not.There some interesting studies conduct by Northwestern University. I have tried to call them and read them but I end up in dead end.Moreover there are some referwences that supposed to be direct interviews to a celebrity that I would like to read and this is no possible at all.Last but not least the book binding is terrible and it is follinng apart after the first month...I might be using it often????Anyway I recommed this book to anyone interested in the Celebrity industry!!!
3,Too didactic,"I was somewhat disappointed with this short book. The author seems to have targeted the book to young people rather than older, more demanding readers. The book is comprised of very short, easy-to-read chapters written with too much moral heavy-handedness. The second half is nothing but a series of chapters on the moral lessons of his life with a decidedly religious take. A hagiography for early adolescents. This is not a book that takes much time to develop more complex themes of his life, times, and ideas.Nevertheless, I finished the book with great admiration for Patrick Henry and an eagerness to read more about him and his ideas. I came to the book wanting to know more about the Anti-Federalists, as Henry was the most visible leader. I didn't get what I was searching for in this book. An okay book for young people but too simplistic and pat for others wanting a more intellectually demanding examination of the man."
3,"A little redundant, but nice","Overall I really enjoyed this book, and it held some new information on Patrick Henry of which I, a professed afficionado of the man, was not aware. It is written in simple, understandable language, but it ended up becoming a little redundant as it progressed, repeating some things from chapter to chapter as if the author thought that a person would be jumping around to read only segments of interest, rather than reading through from start to finish. But I would still recommend it to anyone who asked."
2,Boring,"I found this book extremely difficult to follow, and less than interesting to put it as politely as possible.Instructional design is an interesting topic, coming up with ideas that meet the learning needs of my students is always a challenge I enjoy. I wanted to add some structure to what I do so I bought this book. Mistake!The ideas presented in this book are by no means ground-breaking or new, and are actually often common-sense to educators/trainers with more than a few years of experience like myself. Not only does the author go into excessive detail with multiple useless charts and checklists, but his thoughts are not organised, which makes the book extremely hard to follow. It is like he just scribbled down ideas as they came to him.I feel sorry for any prospective Instructional Designers who might be stuck with this as a text book. That is enough to put anyone off ID as a career!"
1,Know what your drinking,"We are having an Obesity crisis on our hands now... Why add chemicals to your kids... or to YOU!If you don't have the same chemicals in your spice rack, why would you be eating them?"
2,Tastes like Grape Flinstones Chewable Vitamins,"This is for the white can Rock Star. While drinkable, this drink has a chalky aftertaste and a fairly wretched flintsones grape vitamin taste. If you like chewable flintstones grape vitamins and a chalky aftertaste, you'll love Rockstar Zero Carb Energy Drink.Not to my taste."
5,find it at the beach,all the adults in our family were playing with this game. The kids love it and I plan on buying different versions for their birthdays!
2,"Ready, Aim, FIRE!!!","You are the lord of a kingdom, and you start out this game by building walls around a single castle and placing three cannons. Why do you need these cannons? Because your castle is soon invaded by ships, tanks and firebombs. This might sound like a good game now, until you hear that its all played out in a single screen where you move a crosshair around the screen shooting at the ships for 20 seconds. Then the game stops, like an intermission and you get to repair the walls to your kingdom. You must circle at least one castle with your walls, or else you fail and they win! Its a very difficult level, especially when the tanks come and there can be a sea of tanks where you cannot build a wall on them, so you must build it around them."
5,Was going to buy but...,...it's impossible to buy when it's not for sale! The second I saw it I was going to buy it. Too bad. It'd make me and my wife very happy and stop the silly arguements!
1,Very unhappy & returned this curling iron,"I was very disappointed with this curling iron for two reasons. 1) While I was using it the heat settings easily kept changing to less heat because of where the heat dial is place and my finger kept changing the heat settings unintentionally. Very frustrating. 2) It would not hold a curl for me. I have long, thick, yet fine, hair. I think my hair is hard to keep a curl, but usually have really good luck with cermaic tools. I have an Amika tourmaline ceramic curling wand that works great on my hair and holds curl. I tried a few different things to by changing my conditioner and styling products and even using Bumble and Bumble mousse and hairspray, my curls fell flat within 30-45 minutes and my hair looked terrible. I'm returning this and going to try a Hot Tools product to see if that is any better."
3,Works well,"This is a good curling iron for the price. It does a good job curling my hair with appropriate size of curls. However, I find my hair doesn't stay for long and falls straight, but that is typical for my hair type. Would purchase again."
2,Not a good curler at all,"Let me start by saying, these curlers were not my original choice, but 'looked good on paper', so I decided to give them a try. They don't hold a curl, they are not very easy to use and I don't like the way they make my hair feel. I would have sent them back, but because there is no defect, I wasn't able to, so I'm stuck with them. May try to get rid of them on ebay one day soon....."
4,Fun and Easy,"This book is exellent for the absolute beginner. It is well organized, and gives the learner just the right information to get by in Portuguese. The vocabulary stickers make learning new words a snap, as you are constantly reminded of them as you go about your day. This book also includes very helpful pronounciation reminders above all the words, which speeds the process as well. Finally, the cut-out dining guides, flash cards, and important phrases are the ultimate companions to the traveler. A must have for those with little time to spare."
4,Variety,"I like the stickers that you can place on objects in your home; they helped me learn some nouns. Also, I like how they write in English, but incorporate Portuguese words as you learn. The only fault I've found is that I don't always agree with the pronunciation guides."
2,Review of Portuguese in 10 Minutes a Day,"I bought this book because I wanted a good Native Portuguese Language Guide. However once I began using it, I discovered through a native speaker friend of mine that this book was in fact a Brazilian-Portuguese publication. And no where in the book does it state this most important fact. I called the publisher only to be told that there where aware of this fact.I give this book high marks for organization and content presentation. As a Native Portuguese Language Guide it is a real disappointment."
5,FANTASTIC ARTIST.,"Voltaire brings his own creation to life...two parts sorrow, three parts satire....all neatly wrapped up in a magical little gothic-folk sound. A most unusual album filled with east coast attitude. Anybody with a brain would love this album but chances are it will never circulate above the underground goth scene just because there are not enough eclectic music collectors these days. You don't have to be a goth to fall in love with this brilliant album....but you probably have to know a goth to even know that this album exists....sad little truth."
4,Good House Music,Being from Chicago I buy Heather's tapes at the record store all the time. I'm a huge fan. The cd is very good. Tight mixing skills but the track selection is not as good as some of the tapes I have of hers.
4,Great for Getting Started,"Easy to read and informative. The jewel in this book is the source code for the objects that are ready to use right out of the box. If you need to put together an application that mines information from the internet really quickly, this is the book. This book is about retrieving and parsing http, (port 80) only."
5,A Future Classic,"Covered everything I needed to know to write an intelligent data gathering web bot. The material is accurate, relevant and up to date while covering the subject matter to a depth that you would normally expect from a third edition text. Do my business a favour and don't buy this book."
1,Smell Faintly of Dead Fish - Totally Gross,"I can only speak for the 4 pillows that I briefly owned, (I bought them on a riduculously good sale that was apparently too good to be true) but I do NOT recommend this product. I recommend you stay away.I had these pillows in my house for exactly 20 minutes before they were packed up, ready to be sent back. When you get close to them, they smell similar to how a pond smells. Murky, sickening, vaguely of decaying matter. I can't get them out of my house fast enough."
2,Would not recommend,"Bought this because it had dial-up capabilities and I have had non-wireless versions in the past and was relatively satisfied with the previously purchased models. Here is what I have encountered with this new wireless one though:A random lockup at least once a day where you can still establish radio communication but IP is just not there. A reset fixes this.A lockup of networking off the box (you can disconnect, re-dial and still not move packets to/fro net). A reset fixes this.The interface is lacking *bigtime*. Sure, you wouldn't expect to need to be in it beyond initial setup but believe me... you'll be there often checking status during the normally scheduled lockups.Anyway, if you don't need dialup... get something else. This box is a pain in the rear. I am just hoping they'll update the firmware as I am a slave the the fact that I couldn't find another wireless router with the dial capabilities."
1,Worst product ever,"I seriously think there is something wrong with the latest generation of broadband routers by SMC. I bought the 7004AWBR router, and it's been crashing on me every single day disconnecting from the Internet. I can't ping the router, or access the admin web page to reset it. It's extremely frustrating having to manually reset the router everyday. SMC tech support has been unresponsive to this matter. Btw, I upgraded the firmware of the router the same day I installed it. I also had a 7004ABR as well before, and that kept on crashing on me. So I'd suggest you all stay away from SMC broadband routers, unless you want to reset the router everyday."
3,Not as reliable as it should be,"I've had this product over a year and have decided to replace it with the D-LINK 714P+. This product was easy to setup and the print server worked fine (I have one PC connected directly to the router, two notebooks connected wirelessly, and a printer connected to the print server). The wireless range was also much better than the Linksys product I had before. The main problem with this SMC product was that I would have to reboot it every 2-3 weeks. Rebooting it, required that I unplug it for at least 10 seconds and then plug it back in. I've talked to other people who use the SMC7004AWBR and they have experienced the same problem. With these types of products, you should be able to set it up and then forget about it. You can't do that with the SMC7004AWBR but according to people I have talked to, once they set up their D-LINK 714P+, they never had to touch it again."
2,Unreliable product,The router locks up once every day (for both wired and wireless connections). I had to use a browser to reset it to make it work again. Called customer service several times. Each time I waited more than 30 mins and eventually gave up. Will return it to the store and find another alternative for my home network.
1,SMC7004AWBR has good features but is unreliable,This device locks up once a day and must be reset by disconnecting the power or by using the reset feature of the SMC router web page. e-mails to SMC about this problem have not been answered. The SMC technical support telephone number reports that the wait to speak to someone will be 30 minutes. I can not recommend buying SMC products.
1,Great while it worked,"I bought this item and was able to set it up very quickly. However, as soon as I tried to upgrade the firmware, it fried. So much for ease of use. A general complaint of all of these types of products is that they are COMPLEX!!!!!! I can't say that enough. If you don't know a little bit about PC's and networking, you are gonna be lost. It's not just plug, plug, go. It's plug, plug, try, replug, retry, access config, try, pray, retry, power down, retry, etc. It took me 30 minutes to set up and that's after I had already set up another vendor's product. Be warned!!!!"
5,Palmers is a success!!!,"This is an excellent product that I have been using for over 20 years. It moisturizes the hair, conditions and protects against heat products and breakage. It also smells nice and helps to control frizz and flyaways. Good for all hair textures."
3,"Good, But Not Great Amy Tan","I was really excited that Amy Tan decided to do this non-fiction book of essays. I really wanted to learn more about her as a person and writer. Unfortunately, it's a mish-mash of essays, e-mails and prepared speeches written over different times and a lot of it overlaps. The essays are categorized under different themes, but still doesn't flow really well. I wish she had written a straight-forward memoir which I think would have been fascinating instead of giving us glimpses of her life here and there. For example, after being married for appx. 30 years, it would have been interesting to her ""musings"" about marriage, etc. There are some really moving essays here, esp. ""Last Week"" about her mother's final days."
5,An extremely honest book,"Ms Tan being a famous author, expected the memoirs to be heavy with dry details of writing, pure business chase and negotiations with publishers. A pleasant surprise this book tuned out to be, you don't read it, you rather listen to it as you would to a close friend talking to you, sharing the lost growing us years with you, as Amy tells you about the life impacting death of her friend Pete, their para normal encounters, setting Amy on a path of being a successful author. Elizabeth Gilbert a TED talk spoke of the need for an author to separate his artistic self, considering genius as something outside of the author responsible for all her good (and bad) work, and Amy seems to have actually lived it. The boldness with which Amy writes of the love-hate relationship she had with her mother is heart warming and endearing. As you put the book down, a voice rings in your ears long after..Amy..ah, and that is the strength of this book. An enjoyable read."
3,KVM Cables -- Really,"The cables are kind of bulky. I can't seem to find the ones that used to buy. (There was a VGA Male connector with two PS2 Male connectors and a VGA Female connector and Two PS2 Male connectors. They were all wrapped up in one single round cable and were color coded.)These cables seems to be good quality cables but I couldn't use them.I should have read the description for these cables. I was expecting the Keyboard and Mouse connectors on the side with the female VGA to be male but they were not.I don't have a KVM that takes female Keyboard or Mouse connectors and I haven't seen one that does.These are definitely extension cables.I've decided that I need a newer KVM. So after some research I've purchased:Tripp Lite B064-016 16-Port 4-User Cat5 KVM Switch, 1U, RackmountIt uses CAT5 cables to go between the server and the KVM. I haven't received it yet."
5,SimpleTech 160GB USB 2.0 EXTERNAL HD 3.5,"Easy to install, rapid data transfer. Although it is too new to comment on its longevit, I am pleased with the device."
2,SimpleTech 160 GB External Hard Drive,"The SimpleTech 160 GB External Hard Drive is loud, gets hot, and now is not recognized by several computers. So far, I have tried it on 4 computers. Reliability is essential for hard drives! I have all this data no longer available. I'm going to take it in to some computer tech to see if they can retrieve the data for me."
2,Poor support - don't buy this product,I own a simpletech by pininfarina 250 gb external hard drive.I am running windows 7 and another computer on XP professional.The hd is recognized by XP but not by windows 7.Windows 7 does not recognize the driver.Have asked simpletech support many times for a driver and they repeatedly tell me to ask toshiba to update their motherboard. However all other devices work well connected to USB.Don't buy simpletech as their support is horrible. Search the web for simpletech hard drives and there is a dearth of complaints!
1,It works pretty well...I'm happy,"Um I plugged this thing in but my mac recognizes the drive but I can't put anything on it. Apparently it's read only and you it's in Windows NT Filesystem or whatever it is. Anyway it would be nice if it ACTUALLY WORKS WITH Mac OS X, instead of writing empty phrases on the box....""Built for OS X"" yeah right. And no don't you call my macbook pro a piece of garbage!I'll put in a good review later if it works, but right now it doesn't.Later:Well turns out I probably should have read the whole manual before posting this review. Um now it works soo....it's a 4 star....-1 star for the trouble it gave me in the beginning. Silly me."
4,Very easy and convenient,"It was really easy to use this drive, no installation,no downloading, just connect and it is ready to go. So far I have not experienced any difficulty with this product and feel at ease because all my data is safe and secure and can be taken anywhere."
1,Quit Working....,I too purchased the Simple Tech and it was wonderful for about a month. Now the computer will not recognize the external drive. There is information on this drive that simply can't be replaced. I am extremely disappointed with the performance and am mailing back to the mfg.
2,I am very disappointed,"The cable worked. That's about it. The software provided did not work, and it did not include the VX8300 model?! There was no contact information for the manufacturer, and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver, plus I had to find software to use this thing."
2,No software support.,"This calbe is fine. But its pretty much useless if you don't have the software to run it. I was on the old Windows 98 operating system, and this was pretty much useless. I guess its all good if you have XP. Now I have XP, and to tell you the truth, I haven't used it."
1,"Impossible to read, the font is too small",I received a non-readable copy -- the font is less then 5 pt -- buyer beware...
3,"Good, but I'm not a great lover of this book...","I really like Casanova, and I've found his memoirs to be great reading. When I saw this book, I thought it would be an enjoyable, sensual period story. I was slightly disappointed, however; it is somewhat sensual, but not much. The story becomes kind of unbelievable at times, and by the end of the novel I didn't really care that it was over. The parts that are fun to read seem to be the parts based on Casanova's own writings."
3,Good entertainment if you like sci-fi,"I have seen Virtual Assassin about 3 times on T.V. and for some reason I like it. I wouldn't call it fantastic, or even a great movie, but it is good entertainment for anyone who likes sci-fi and cyber-based stories.Michael Dudikoff plays an ex-cop janitor at a computer technology firm who is thrown into an undesirable situation when a crazy cyber-villain takes over the building in order to get a sort of AI-based virus. The villain's actual goal is to incorporate the virus into his own mind, to become a sort of cyber-organism. The janitor Dudikoff must put his skills to work to protect the computer firm's employees (including a girl he likes) and destroy the crazy villain.The acting is decent, the story is okay, and even though the movie is a low-budget sci-fi flick, it is good to watch if you have some free time. Every now and then it airs on the Space channel, so maybe you can see it soon and decide for yourself how good it is."
4,Very good compliment to Olmsted book on options,I found the book an easy to read/ understand approach to options trading. I am finding this book along with Olmsted's book a valued source to refer back to as i gain experience in the very interesting world of options trading. The summary listong of the various option strategies in one of the appendices has special value as an easy to use reference tool.
4,Easier yes. Easy ... no.,"Guy Cohen has done a remarkable job making the world of options more reasonable for the begining investor (such as myself), however I consider myself reasonably intelligent and I struggled with some of the risk profiles. After I gained an understanding of what the author was explaining I felt that some aspects of the book could have been explained more completely.(An example would be explaining that the break even mark on the risk profile was calculated using only the time value of the option and not the intrinsic value and this only applies if the option is sold at expiration.)Overall I feel that this book is the best content value I have found on the subject and I highly recomend it for beginning traders who may find it difficult to shell out some of the big ticket prices charged by people teaching this subject."
2,Options Made Easy - not really that easy,"Although this book seems to be well written, with a title like ""Options Made Easy"" one would assume that it would be a good book for the inexperienced options trader. If you're a beginner, this isn't the book for you. It assumes that you have knowledge about the subject. Read ""Understanding Options"" by Michael Sincere first. After you become familiar with the subject, then read Options Made Easy."
3,does not seem to last long term,"I purchased this item from a walk-in store approx 18 months ago. The picture is fantastic! I connected using DVI and the image quality for editing DVDs worked well. The large screen allowed me to work with video production software with room for everything I needed to see.That said, now the bad news. It quit working today while using it. No warning, just a quick fade to black and done!For the money paid I feel it should last longer than just beyond the manufacturer's warranty period.Since my warranty (assuming one year, but could be less) is up, I have to buy a replacement, I will go with another manufacturer.The image and everything is fantastic with this unit, just didn't have longevity which in today's economy is not good in my opinion. Rising prices means consumers will expect quality for what they do spend money on. This wasn't it."
5,Little Miss Sunshine Fun in the Sun,"We purchased this video for our grandchildren ages 4 and 7 and they love it, we bought this because their dad (our son) had the books when he was young and they were a hit back then about 30 yrs ago, we still have a few of the books that the grandchildren read and now the video brings the characters to life. Our grandson the 4 yr old, knows every character by heart. They both have a fun time watching.G and G E"
5,Great for basics and more,"I was recommended to buy this book to learn about positions and such for drawing. I decided it wouldn't hurt and absolutely loved it! It has everything to teach about basic anatomy structures and gives great overall instructions on how to draw men and females in a comic sort of way, although I take from the comic designs and put it towards realistic, definitely a great buy."
2,Cutting Edge Not Deep Enough,"Although Hart's talented, his book will not improve beginners' skills because he does not fully develop each section. Cutting Edge needs to be twice its size to cover its topics. A person can spend years getting anatomy down. I had hoped for more step-by-step methods to his style, but Hart jumps from A to Z, expecting the reader to understand the huge gap inbetween. Get drawing experience before reading this, or you'll be disappointed."
5,BUY!,"I took one look at this book at the store and bought it right away! Amazing drawings. It's a need to buy. If you want to brush up on your drawing skills then you'll love it. I bought this for son, and he suddenly started to enjoy drawing. I feel that buying this book will only give you posotive results."
2,Babes [and] heros w/ giant muscles--cutting edge?,"Sorry. It's rather typical, I'm afraid. It's a collection of obscenely-muscled male hero stereotypes, and barely-clothed babes with [a]giant [chest], skin-tight outfits and bare midriffs and absurdly-low pants (starting right at the cover). No doubt they're sexy, but I wouldn't call it ""cutting edge."" Rather, it's dead-center in the middle of comic cliches that abound on any comics store shelf. While it's fun to draw and gaze on such hypersexed creatures, there's a weird feeling of adolescant bedroom horniness about it all. When are we going to see truly ""cutting edge"" characters who aren't all imitations of the same body with different heads and costumes?"
2,No talent Hack,Your better off buying your favorite comic books then buying this book. Problem is he's trying to adapt to the Marvel House of style. You don't need extream foreshortening to be a good line artist. The book was rushed and done for money. There is a DC comics book out there with Klaus Jansen and Draw magazine published by twomorrow is a better bang for you buck.
4,An ok book,"Most of the new Nancy Drew books suffer from bad writing,and boring plots.This book suffers from the same.The only interesting thing about this is its one of the plots for the game ""Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake"".If you have played the game,you should read the book.Its interesting to see who they left out and what was changed."
4,este producto no se puede calificar hasta pasado un tiempo,"este tipo de baterias, solo pueden ser calificadas por el tiempo que duran o que mantienen la carga, si despues de un ano o mas sigue funcionando como hasta ahora, seria mucho mas clara y veridica la informacion de los usuarios, ya que es la unica forma de calificar la calidad de las baterias, pero por el precio, vale la pena averiguarlo... hasta ahora muy bien, esperemos asi continuen, que tengan suerte, aunque no creo que duren como las originales.. pero habra que esperar."
4,works well,"The battery pack works well. At first I was concerned because the amperage was a different number, but that doesn't seem to have any effect on the performance. The charge lasts a long time and our camera works fine."
4,Have a 1 Year Warranty,At first I was surprised to see that they came with a one year warranty. I did not expect to get a years life out of batteries at this price. The warranty expired 9 months ago and they are still taking a full charge.
3,so far so good,It goes on easily. I like the self-propellant rather than a pressurized can. Seemed to work OK the first day out but will have to wait for a few more tries to see if it lasts.
1,Didn't Work,"I was directed to this company by Carhart after telling them their rain jacket had lost its water repellency. I followed the directions to a ""Tee"", but I still got wet in the next rain storm. I called Nikwax, they agreed I did everything correctly, and they're sending me more product. If that doesn't work, they said to send them the garment and they will analyze it. This was a two part process using their special wash. Kinda disappointing after spending $25.00 on a 3 year old $130.00 Carhart rain jacket"
2,Not what I needed.,"In the description and reviews it says that it works fantastic as a water-resistant/proofing product on synthetic fabrics. I applied it 3 times onto my backpack, making sure that each time the Nikwax was totally dry, and then dribbled water on it to test it. Water soaked in everytime, it didn't even form droplets or run off. I had high hopes for this product because I didn't want to go buy another day pack but I was sadly disappointed. So I got a rain cover instead."
1,Didn't work for me.,"Boy I wish this product had worked for me as well as the other reviewer. That's the results I expected but didn't get. My experience:I read up on all the various waterproofing products because my cloth (600 Denier Carbolex) motorcycle jacket needed to be treated. So I decided on Nikwax. I bought the wash and the spray on waterproofing, since the wash-in waterproofing would waterproof the inside, which wasn't needed. With the spray I could only get it on the outer shell. I followed the instructions, first wash the garment then spray and let dry. Then I wore it in the rain a few weeks later. I got soaked. It actually made it worse than before. I wish I had just left it alone. I've used the inexpensive spray-on products that work better than this product. Save your money."
1,Lies!!!! Lies!!! Lies!!!!,If you want a pack of liberal/socialist lies then this is the book for you. If you posess a semi-intelligent mind you'll hate it!
2,"Promising parts, terrible whole","This book has some interesting insights in the content analysis, especially the analytical framework within which it occurs, but it is greatly marred by an insistent need to be hopelessly obscure in its writing. The author seems to be purposely attempting to put things in as difficult jargon (both in the sense of scholarly but more importantly in the sense of 'strange') as possible. This book strikes me as infinitely inferior to the book by Fico et al on the same topic."
2,Don't be fooled by this CD,"Well everyone don't be fooled like I was! This album does not represent the much awaited return of our treasured Meg Christian. It rather seems to be a case of Amazon getting it wrong! Meg may have a reasonable voice - but she bears absolutely no resemblance in any form to the Meg we have loved for so long. I don't even know if this Meg is even really a Christian - seems the catalogue needs checking by Amazon, before they pass this girl off as our beloved original. In summary then PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED!!!"
1,REBOOT CITY ROUTER - BEFW11S4 V4,"Been having the same problem every one else has with Version 4At first it seems to work great then if you use IM or ICQ etc. BINGO it seems to lockup. Using a WET 11 on upstairs DELL.On my second unit and after about 2 hours it went ""South"". Weird thing also happened..lost connection them my e-mail computer (DURON 1.0G) dialed up ISP through telco modem and made connection, then unit seemed to ""unlock"". This firmware has to have bugs for sure. Having set up wired LINKSYS Routers before and had mostly no problems with FTP or AIM. BEFW11S4 V4 needs a firmware update or a technical bulletin explaining what settings are needed to keep it working online. Rebooting seems to fix for a while 1/2 Hour to 8 Hours (overnight). Most likely will returnit for a wired unit and a stand alone access point. Have 4 computers on this unit 3 wired 1 wireless."
1,Range [is bad},"For some reason, I can't get more than ten feet away without the unit without getting a warning that my network connection's been lost. I've tried updating the firmware, power-cycling, etc. Nothing works. Maybe this is an exception rather than the rule, but their customer service [is bad] too. I tried everything they suggested, and nothing worked. I wanted an exchange, but I still have the old unit."
2,BEFW11S4 Range,"I got two of those routers one in a California home and one in France (wooden and brick houses respectively, no concrete)I use them exclusively indoor and in both cases the maximum range is about 30 feet!!! Beyond that there is no signal.I then added a Linksys booster to the one in France, with no change whatsoever in range.I emailed twice to customer service at Linksys without getting an answer nor an aknowledgement not to mention an explanation.I do not know of the other brands of wireless routers but this one is poor range wise."
3,Update the Firmware,I spent hours struggling with the router trying to get it to work. Finally I went to the Linksys website and discovered that I did not have the latest firmware. I updated the firmware and it now works great. I am still waiting for a response to my email from Linksys technical support regarding this problem. A prompt response could have saved me hours of frustration.
1,Forget any customer service,It broke within a week of getting it. Customer service has at least an hour wait. Can't help if you don't have all Linksys products. They don't do what they promise. Couldn't get them to tell me how to return the damm thing. It's a great idea but terrible follow through. I am going to buy the competition's model.
2,Worked great at first,"Received my router - followed the instructions - plugged the cable modem to the router, router to the computer and....everything worked great for 3 weeks. Since that time I have had trouble accessing the internet through the router. The helpline took an hour to sort out the problem out and it still isn't sorted to my satisfaction. If I leave the computer turned on for more than 24 hours I need to turn off the modem and router to allow the IP addresses to reset (or something like this !). It appears to be linked to static and dynamic IP address problems, but the literature that came with it didn't explain this. I had to download the book from the internet. It's getting way too technical for my level of computer knowledge. If you are going to buy this product make sure you are knowledgeable enough about IP addresses, DHCP setting etc"
5,This thing rocks. Easy to setup w/ IPSec Passthru & WEP,"I ordered the product and after reading the negative reviews I had steeled myself for the worst, but setting this up was a dream! This was by far the easiest network product that I have ever setup and I have a relatively complex network that included IPSec Passthru of a wireless node..."
2,The cover range is too SHORT!,"On the ads it says the cover range for indoor use can reach 300 feet, but the ones (wireless router and wireless PC card both from Linksys) I bought they just could go less than 10 feet. The signal strength could never beyond 60% even the antennas were as close as 3 INCHES to the PC card. The tech suggested me to return them back. That's a quick solution.PS. After this incident, I bought a Lucent OriCONO wireless PC card and D-Link wireless router at similar price. Both work great and, regardless of upstair or basement, the signal keeps at 100% strength."
1,Do not buy this router,"This router is TERRIBLE, I've had this piece of crap for over a year and it is incredibly glitch and buggy. The latest firmware update causes even more glitches and the worst part is that the reset button on it is broken. Linksys seems to have discontinued their support for this horrible device and I'm sure you can figure out why. Do not buy this."
4,Have had it almost 1 year,I have it almost one year and it is working great. I have 2 machines at home (laptop and desktop) on wireless. I dot use the encryption because had some issues but no worries because of mac address reservation. Overall for a good switch/wireless/router I would give it a thumbs up.
2,Poor Linksys Product,"After several months using this product and trying to get VPN to work wireless, I finally got it working via the DMZ. This is very poor, since only 1 machine can now use wireless VPN. Tech support is almost non-existant. Due to the very limited VPN support, I finally threw it out and got the Netgear equivalent. With the Netgear wireless router, I can now have several PC's using VPN."
1,even their tech support could not make it work,"I spent a long time trying to make this box work. I spent about an hour with the tech support and he could not make it work with PPPoE. This box definately does not work with Mindspring in the Berkeley, CA area. I am a pretty tech savvy guy, and I could not make it work, so unless you know for sure this will work for you, I would try Netgear. I use the linksys wireless pcmcia card, however, with no problems."
1,FRUSTRATING DISASTERS...,"This device appears to be a good idea, on paper. I had to return the first unit because it would fail pinging (via wireless connection) after twenty minutes. After detailed discussions with LinkSys, they confirmed it was a defective unit. I, foolishly, purchased a replacement unit and I have the same serious problems. IT IS NOT A SETUP PROBLEM. It will correctly respond to ping testing for only the first hour at the most. I would urge anyone who owns one of these units to try pinging the device FROM A WIRELESS connection (the ping via CAT5 connection is fine). I am fairly sure that you will soon discover that the ping will fail within an hour. It is the wireless section of this device that has a bad design. Linksys is not willing to admint it, yet. I spoke with several technicians. One of them was very helpful and knows his stuff. The others make the same useless suggestions repeatedly. Unless you enjoy hours of frustration, avoid this thing like a bad block of cheese."
3,A refernce router,"A bit of a reference. Good all-around Wi-Fi router, Linksys must have sold a ton of them, but it is now quite obsolete..."
1,Not compatible with IBM TP X31 Centrino,"I have tried two wireless routers to date with my IBM Thinkpad w/ Centrino wireless. My first, the Linksys BEFW11S4, never sustained a connection for longer than 30 seconds before dropping the connection, then re-establishing, then dropping, etc. Impossible to download large files, get booted off IM constantly, and took forever for simple websites to open. Linksys technical support even tried to dump me off to IBM technical support, but I just didn't buy it, considering my wireless connections have been fine elsewhere. I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that, tweaking the connection software, upgrading firmware, blah blah blah, but honestly, how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running.The D-Link DI-614+ has since worked like a charm. Easy to setup. No dropped connections. Seems like it works fine with my Centrino."
3,"mixed bag, not the easiest to set up.","This router is great when its working. However this router is a lil picky sometimes. I downgraded the firmware and it seems to be running faster. However i still get problems with the wifi dropping. this is a very common problem with this router and it requires a power cycle to clear out the problem. One of the previous commenters said linksys will give him a new one but i doubt that will fix the problem. while some of the problems are related to firmware, others are related to the manual settings. this router needs a lil fine tunning for it to run right.this router is by far better than my old netgear router which required power cycles more than once a day and it still didnt work correctly. but his router does require some setup since the design is kinda old."
3,Good when it worked properly 3 years ago,"Probably just from wear & tear, but as I said it worked well three years ago when I first brought it. However I just recently replaced it with the Linksys WRT54GL because this started to drop the connection too often for me to deal with. I would have to unplug the thing 3 or 4 times before I could get internet to the other PC's in my home. G is faster then B these days so the BEFW11S4 isn't needed anymore."
1,Avoid this router...,"It's cheap, but you get what you pay for. It shipped with v 1.50.10 of the firmware, but using this version, the router didn't work with one of my friend's wireless cards. Upgrading it to 1.50.14 broke connectivity with another one of my friend's wireless card. When I upgraded it to 1.52.02, there were no connection problems with the wireless... but now, random connections will drop every few minutes. It makes the connection more or less useless. I'm planning on upgrading routers--I haven't decided to what yet. Even though the DGL-4300 by DLink is a lot more expensive, all the reviews are positive, so I'm strongly considering upgrading to that."
2,Time Bomb,"I bought this router around March 2003. No problems with installation and I have been very happy with the speed, running three machines on it.In late December, I noticed that my connection speed was down significantly. After working through my cable internet provider's technical support, they pointed me to the router. I called LinkSys and was told I needed to update the firmware. Hours of frustration later, the thing is 'dead in the water'.I undertsand that the this is a common problem over time. Now I am looking at what to replace this with. Be aware that you may buying a time bomb - may work for a while then die."
1,The most hackable router ever?,"Initially the product worked well for me, although there were some config issues to begin with, due to old firmware. However after about 6 months the router began to reset randomly - at first I thought there was a problem with the router until one time I came back to find someone trying to surf my network - turns out that the default setting for the wireless option is enabled with no WEP encryption - so a LOCAL hacker had taken to resetting the router using an easy network call and then surfing into my network using the wireless link...it got so bad I had to change to a new product. The forums are alive with postings that show how easy it is to hack this product. I would not advise the use of this router if you have confidential information on your network."
3,"Slow router, unstable connection, and deception about rebate","Router is not very reliable - unstable and slow connection and downdoading; you have to restart your computer at least twice in hour.Also, do not trust Linksys's ads about rebates: I have bought 3 items that were eligible for rebates (i.e., 3 weeks before the end of the qualifying period). They deceived me and refused to pay any.So, next time I will choose another brand"
2,Wireless Problems,"I would hold off on buying this one ( Model BEFW11S4 V.2 )Anytime a cordless phone is used in the house it knocks out my wireless connection.Otherwise it works great when the cordless phone is not used.They do have a new version 5 Ghz.Too late for me,"
3,Good but stopped working,"The wireless functionality stopped working after about a year. Not built to last. I replaced it with NetGear equivalent, now I'm back in business."
1,This router sucks,"It's true I bought it used, so maybe that's why it works so bad, but maybe not. The only way to get a good signal from it is to be less than 10ft away. If I go into the other room, it drops in and out. I regret spending $30 on this POS."
2,poor wireless range,"Linksys' wired router works great and easy to set up.However, wireless range is too short. (i've tested with three different pcmcia cards....SMC, Linksys, D-link....all didn't pick up signal only from a wall away(and about 30 ft)).Buy something else."
3,"Ok, but bad price/performance ratio","It works (with a bit of effort). The main problem I ran into was that the text boxes in the config webpage are a few pixles too small, making the trailing 'B' in my encryption key look like an 'E', and the DHCP didn't work until I had it plugged in for a few days (although DHCP rarely works without a hitch when you have a computer that thinks it should be the DHCP server). Frankly, there are better routers (from D-link for example) that do the job better for the money.On the bright side, it does have a decent range, and once you actualy get it working, it works pretty well with all other hardware."
2,When it works... it's Great,"Installation was quite easy. And it worked great.Then the next day it stopped working... called customer service... they got it to work... the next day it stopped working again... and called cutomer service again... after about a week of this nonsense I was told my unit had a problem they referred to as the 'cache of death'... they said to return it... so I did... and this new unit still has problems.When the product works, it's outstanding. But it's as reliable as a Fiat."
2,highly disappointed,"The router worked real well for about a day and then the wireless connection went south. Also, I noticed some of the web pages are missing from the configuration page and periodically I get erroneous error messages when updating the configuration. And if this was enough, I also notice some latency when accessing my LAN remotely via telnet (forwarding port 23 to my Unix server).Needless the say I'm highly disappointed with this product more effort should have been put into quality of service before releasing this product on the market..."
2,Dead after 17 months,"This unit died after 17 months of use. If not, I would give it a 5 stars.I bought it (BEFW11S4 V2) in 08/2002 from Amazon. Every thing worked fine, easy installed. No problems at all before dead. Worked well with both Netgear and SMC wireless cards. The signals are better than the D-Link 614+ I just bought. But if you want to have a unit lasted longer than 2 years, Beware."
2,"OK for surfing, but wireless signal is perpetually weak","I purchased this over a year ago and have had the same problems from day-one. Setup takes some time and I spent several hours with Linksys tech support to get it working properly. Even after fine-tuning it, the wireless signal was faint at best. Today, I am having the same problems in a new and much smaller apartment. I would avoid this router."
3,Can't be beat for the price - but you get what you pay for.,"If you want wireless, this router will do the job nicely. With 128-bit WEP, it's minimally secure enough to deploy in a home environment. However, contrary to company literature and the users guide, it will NOT allow the designation of MAC addresses as 'go/no go.' All it will alllow is ""no go."" So the MAC filtering that is advertised only works to cut off a networked computer from accessing the Internet. Fine if you're controlling your kids, but not so fine if what you want is to positively designate the computers that are allowed to use the wireless system in your home (to avoid hacking)."
4,This thing rocks!,"I was real hesitant about ordering because of all the bad reviews concerning range, but I haven't had any problems. I did buy the ORINOCO silver card for my laptop and it works great. I have range everywhere in my house, even through plaster walls. I don't know if I'm lucky, but I can be anywhere in the house and usually pull 5Mbs. If your on the fence about buying one, just do it. They are so cheap now. The Linksys unit is so easy configure, took 5mins."
2,Short range and must clone MAC,"First, Linksys router's MAC addresses are blacklisted by AT&T Cable Broadband, thus you must clone the MAC address to get it working. That is not really an issue for some people but for others who expected plug-and-play would be frustrated without going through the tech support. This is not really Linksys' fault.Second, the range for the wireless part is simply way too short. Despite what the box says, the range I was able to get is about 20 feet, which is not all that much. Depending on your card, you might be able to get it longer but the range is simply too short to be useful."
1,No Service After Warranty Period,"After One year of use, this router quit working. I spent hours trying to repair this item. I decided to purchase another one so my network would continue to work while I sent this one in for repair. After purchasing the new one (which works fine) I was informed from Linksys support that they do not offer a repair service for this product. I'm now a proud owner of a [$$$] paper weight."
1,Unreliable piece of junk that locks up frequently,Title says it all. This piece of junk has locked up a minimum of twice a week since I bought it a year ago. Have to unplug it and re-plug it in every time to reset it. Downloading the most recent firmware update made it even worse. Now the thing locks up if you try to view any video on [...]
2,Easy Setup Worked Great --for 3 months...,"I'm a big fan of Linksys, I have used many of their routers for my customers, so when it was time for me to switch to wireless I naturally bought the BEFW11S4. Installation was simple and setting up security is a snap. The unit performed admirably for 3 months and then I started having problems. The unit would need to be reset occasionally. I could live with that, but now it happens once or twice daily. Very annoying. Also the DHCP server has stopped functioning altogether. I'm able to get along by setting up static ips for my pcs and resetting the unit constantly. I have version 4 of the device. I'll stick with Linksys for their wired routers, but time to try someone else for wireless."
1,"no range because ""i have walls""","the wired part works fine. the wireless works fine, too -- in the same room as the router. i have less than a 20' range -- instead of the claimed 300' (indoors -- more outdoors, which i also don't have, because it has to go through -- get this! -- a wall).when i phoned tech support, i was asked if i was in the same room as the router. ""of course not,"" i said, ""if i were, i wouldn't need wireless, i'd just hook it to a cable.""""oh, that's your problem. you have walls. have you tried staying in the same room?""well, yes. but then what's the point of wireless?""why not buy a booster?""i don't want to buy a booster, because i just spent far too much money on this, and i am well near enough the router that i should have decent range.""yes, but the walls block the signal.""a great product, as long as you're right next to the router, or your house has no walls."
1,This router is complete garbage!,"I have owned this router for two months and it has crashed at least twice per week. Each time I have to reset the entire system and start from scratch. Linksys support has failed to identify or correct the problem after months of trying, yet they won't send me a different router. This is the second time I have written this review because it crashed in the middle of the first one!!! Read all of the reviews; I'm not the only one! Buy something else!"
2,Locks up far too often,"What's most annoying is that I often wish to log into my server from work/etc and am unable to connect. I've learned that this means my router has frozen up and needs a reset. It seems to happen at least every week.I've also had lots of trouble with (what seems to be) dropped connections. I'll try to hit Google with a query; the request seems to be en-route, but hitting the browser's ""stop"" button and trying again yields a quicker result (than waiting for it to finish the first try, becuz it probably never will).This router might be ok if you're not trying to run a server behind it, but I wouldn't chance it for anything, myself."
2,Wireless??,"Yes, it is wireless, and very cool if you don't have to go through any serious walls. It works fine everywhere except where I need it to work, which is over the garage. Configuration was complex unless you understand ip addresses, dns, etc. I did get it accomplished only to find out it won't reach the room I wanted it in, (about 40 ft.) Support suggests I buy a third party antenna, terrific. Unless you want to use it out on the deck, run the wire!!"
2,Range is poor and manual/tech support are horrific,"Not recommended.The documentation is just plain wrong, and is fraught with error after error in configuration and setup instructions. Wait time for tech support is huge (20-40 minutes), and tech support reps know very little and keep repeating the same few scripted instructions. Finally after 3 hours of frustration, I enlisted our corporate MIS folks, who were able to get things working, but only after much struggle. I live in an apartment, and the range through concrete walls is less than 30 feet.There must be a better solution!"
1,2006 model,This router is from 2006. I was having trouble with the software and called Cisco and they told me from the model number it was old equipment and not supported anymore. I am shocked that Amazon would have this on their website for sell. I did return it and Amazon refunded the full amount including the shipping. Go to Ciscos web site to review the latest models.
3,functional but mediocre,"At this price, the router is an ok value. The instructions are easy to follow and tech support is satisfactory. But don't expect too much in terms of the range or the signal strength. Was considering to add a signal booster, but would rather wait for a later model with stronger signal built in. That's because I have a b adapter, and should sooner or later upgrade to a g adapter and router."
2,Linksys doesn't support Linux,"Nice router, easy to install on MS Windows.I'm only giving it 2 stars however. Linksys won't support Linux, and their cards (WMP11 PCI card) has absolutely no support for Linux. It used to, then they changed the chipset and the drivers that the community wrote don't work anymore.If you're looking to WiFi your Linux box, buy Lucent or D-Link"
1,Hunk o' Junk,"I have had the Linksys BEF11S4 v.4 (the one compatible with Xbox Live) for over 2 years now. I can't believe it as I am writing this, but I have put up with having to physically power cycle (forcibly reset) the router at least once every two hours! The only reason I have not rushed out and bought a replacement router is because I have spent forever trying to make the best decision and don't want to be in the same shoes in another year or two. I don't know what to do at this point. I have read reviews, guides and visited forums. This is common problem with almost all routers at one time or another but seems to be overly common with this brand/model. I am truly bummed about this product as I have liked other Linksys products in the past but I can't lie this things stinks and was not worth a penny!"
2,Beware of this product and brand,"The wireless interface of my BEFW11S4 ceased working approximaty 5 months after purchasing the unit. After consulting the Amazon reviews, I quickly discovered that this is *not* an uncommon problem.In addition to the problems with the router, customer service has been slow, two days late on sending RMA information, and does not offer to cover shipping or supply a loaner unit for their defective product.In defense of Linksys, the BEFW11S4 was easy to set up, offered decent range, and operated flawlessly-- until it stopped working.There are a number of choices for 802.11b wireless switch/router/NAT boxes. I'd have to think *very* carefully before considering buying this or any other Linksys product again in the future."
4,Actors in this season,"Hi everyone.I don't know who posted the actors that are in this season of Doctor Who (obviously someone with NO knowledge of DW and just wanting the $$ in their pockets), BUT if you are looking for DAVID TENNANT, MATT SMITH AND KAREN GILLAN in this season, you'll be disappointed! They DON'T join the cast until SEASONS 2(DT) AND 5 (MS & KG) respectively.Hope this helps some of you and have a happy Whovian Day =)"
1,poor customer service,"They advertise this as a 3 pack, but it is only 1 filter. The filter was installed because I initially thought there had to be an error on my part, or that I would subsequently receive more filters. I chose this over other single filter listing that I could have purchased for $30 (with shipping). This item totals to nearly $50 with shipping. When I did inquire, they told me that Amazon made a mistake in the listing, and that they were sorry. They are now offering me a ""20% discount"" which I refused, because 20% discount for the 66% of the missing product I ordered is grossly under-cutting it, and term ""discount"" implies they are providing something I should not have received in the first place. Bad customer service, and frankly, it's hard to tell if this in fact was a mistake, because the item is still listed as a ""three pack"" weeks later."
1,Dont waste your time!,"This 'author' claims that Errol had homosexual affiars with every man he met! Convieniently, all quotes regarding Errol's perversions are from long deceased people, thus avoiding any disputes. The book is filled with incorrect facts, too numerous to list. One glaring lie claims that Errol's last word were,""I've had a lot of fun & enjoyed every minute of it."" This is a quote Errol made on a TV appearanance-you can hear the recording on several internet sites. Save your money, there's nothing worth reading in this book!"
5,True Grit Woman Style,"The Scout shows us how tough it was to travel into unknown territory, Indian territory, being a young woman who not only had to drive a Conestoga Wagon, but had to do all the chores and take care of her younger sister who refused to lift a hand to do anything. Through it all she found true love with a man who thought he had died inside and would never love again. But when it's meant to be, it's meant to be. Lynna Banning did an incredible job honoring those women who did travel out west, leaving behind their friends and families and any sense of civility to find something new in life. While it was difficult they persevered so we could have all we have today."
1,Under the Moons of Mars,"First, let's make this clear: I gave the book one star not for the content, which is actually good, but rather for the fact that it is actually not a stand-alone novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is a compilation of The Princess of Mars, The God of Mars and Warlord of Mars. Unfortunately, to the untrained eye, this title may seem to be a novel on its own, so I bought it and found upon receiving it that I already owned these stories...Amazon has a return policy but since the official reason for this order is my mistake (there is no ""duh one couldn't know just by the title that is was a duplicate in the scroll-down menu) I have to absorb the shipping fees, and since I live in Canada I have to ship it to the US which ends up costing me more than the refund I would get... Oh well...Long story short this book is a compilation so if you don't already own the first three short novels of John Carter of Mars go ahead and buy it but otherwise don't be fooled by the title!"
5,Deeply Intelligent Interpretation,"Even from a casual listening it is obvious that Nicol Matt has an impressive grasp on this music and can communicate that understanding to his receptive young singers. The rich and fresh simplicity he evokes from the ranks of the Nordic Chamber Choir perfectly matches the crafted understatement of Lauridsen's scores.The Rose Chansons are suitably deft and delicate, the Fire Madrigals are stunning in their passion. The O Magnum Mysterium, here in the arrangement for organ rather than for full orchestra, propels itself without dragging and without self-indulgence.I was struck most by the choir's intelligence. The Singers and the conductor share an obvious connection with this music (the composer worked with the choir for the recording) that causes it to shine. I recommend the recording without reservation."
3,Poor Windows XP Support,"If you are considering purchasing this product and have Windows XP, you may want to wait a bit until better drivers are released. As of this writing (11/12/01), the 3.08 version of the Thrustmaster drivers just do not work. Thrustmaster is currently working on the issue, but it may be some time before the newer drivers are released.I really like the hardware itself. The wheel is comfortable, easy to use, and handles perfectly. Unfortunately, it just does not work reliably with my operating system."
4,Though not an album Best oasis single,This is by far the best oasis single very released. Its very cleaver with its lyrics and the music to go with it is alittle to bit of a want to be beatles (eleanor rigby) but its still a great song.
2,Poor Color Reproduction,"I recently bought several hundred Sony DVD+R inkjet printable DVDs. I am not a happy customer. I am using an Epson Artisan 800 printer which created beautiful, color perfect labels on the bargain basement printable DVDs I bought on sale at Office Depot, but the labels on the Sony product come out with an awful washed out almost sepia cast to them. I would love to find out that this is my problem and is correctable, but unless someone can tell me what I am doing wrong, I would note buy this product again and feel that I should warn others in advance."
2,I was an extra in this movie,I got paid $35.00 for 12 hours work. Brad Davis pushed me in the critical student protest scene. I'm the one in the blue sweater.
4,Hi,"I really like this album. My favorite tracks are definitely 'Summertime' and 'Lonely Man'. Probably as good as Underdog, maybe even better. Get this; you wont be disappointed."
2,"ouch, what happened, guys?","I used to really like Audio A, but LIFT seems to have been hit by some badness:-( Gone are theri deep soul searching lyrics, now we are hit by simple rhyme schemes and silly songs. And Larry is no where to be found! They still have the same great sound, but seem to be plauged by Brittany type pop lyrics. I also didn;t see Ben Cissel's name in the credits, maybe he is the reason the depth and spiritualness of this album is gone. If so, COME BACK BEN THEY NEED YOU!!!!!"
1,Merely a Coffee Table Book,I bought this book in great expectation of obtaining some ideas and hints for beauty treatments for women over 40. I was wrong! It was merely a book showing off Ms. Haddon's over-40 photograph stills--airbrushed to say the least. It did not tell anything I did not know already on achieving it...
5,"History of Wayne & Clay Co., IL","Excellent Book. A must have for genealogist researching Wayne or Clay counties in Illinois. Goes back to 1st family who founded both counties, where they came from, and much much more."
1,Highwayman Live,I was really disappointed with this product. It is an English version and does not work in USA DVD players. Maybe I should have known that but it should be labeled properly to avoid such confusion. I would lkie to return this product for credit against purchasing a US version.Please advise me.
1,Unable to play on DVD player,"We were unable to play this on our DVD player. This product should have been advertised and said exactly what type of device you need to have in order to play it!!! Why would a company say it is a DVD when you cannot play it on a DVD player? It will play on our computer, but who wants to listen to a DVD on a small computer speaker?! We still do not know what type of device we should buy in order to play this CD!!!! We looked everywhere on the package to see what exact device we need in order to play this DVD. All it says is DVD. This has NEVER happened to us before. In fact I bought DVDs a month later that play just fine on our DVD player.We are extremely disappointed and confused."
1,my review,I assumed this would be a pair but was a single item. After I received this item I was able to find a pair at a local retailer for the same price of this single item. Did not return it as the shipping and restocking fee makes it to costly.
1,"low quality, horrible product","I have a sony high definition tv and everything was always gorgeous on it, but adding this horribly engineered piece of junk by toshiba was a big mistake; the quality of picture it produces for cable television is unwatchable, recorded shows are so dark and blurry you will feel like you are watching the radio, dvds are lower quality than a vhs tape and the useless toshiba support is available about 3 hours during weekdays.How a product that could be at such low standards could ever be sold to the public is beyond me, shame on tivo for letting such a brutally low quality be sold to the public under their brand name, which i had several friends recommend and bigger shame on toshiba for ever releasing such a crap product."
5,Great Help,Found this to be a very useful guide in a small group setting. Promromoted discussion and helped facilitate group interaction. Individuals and larger groups could also benefit from this guide.
5,Kids love it!,"We have a 2, 4, and 6 year old. They all love to play and watch this game and it's so educational."
2,Not real insightful,"It was written by a service member who experiences a combat environment for the first time. If you have experienced a combat related environment then you will not get much from the book. If you have not, then pick a different book. Also, things have changed drastically since Desert Storm. The troops are experiencing much more in the current conflict."
4,Bringing back the old style sound,"This album has brought back the old school sound of the cramps. I have to say that this album is one of the better the Cramps have put out in years. Though some of songs are a bit borish and don't have that total Cramps style about them. After listening to the whole album a few times, those borish songs kind of start to grow on ya. Over all worth the money. If you haven't seem them live...PLease go if you ever have the chance. They are a little more toned down at shows now than back about 10-20 yrs ago. Defintely worth the time to check out."
4,monotonous but fun,this game like others have said is hard. for it's day it was pretty face paced and does require a degree of strategy. Since there are so many different enemies you have to devise a strategy that works best to take them on...not only that they will mix the types later on so that one trick pony idea won't work. yeah this is one of my favorite SNES games. Even though my brother and I beat this game as many times as you can the replay is still great.
2,Not as good as the Genesis version.,"To start off their are two versions of this game, the SNES version and the Genesis version.This game looks terrible in comparison with the Genesis version,less colors, terrible sprites and ugly sounding music.The only plus would probably be that every boss has their own little voice intro but that really isn't important.The snes version is so much harder, you die in about 4 or 5 shots, period. In the genesis version you have continues and more bonus games. One downfall is that you can only choose between two characters on the gens version, but i think that they are the best characters of the four.Skip the SNES version and go straight for the Gens game.Best of luck too you."
4,Amazing but expensive,"How much do you want out of your tush bath?It's made from authentic native american recipe, so I guess you get what you pay for.It worked amazingly well. It cost alot so I only went through one tub on my first child. But it helped the transition."
5,The Best of the Three,"Without a doubt, this CD is PETRA'S best Praise and Worship album yet, although there were no original Petra songs. This CD has something for everyone. Fave songs: ""Send Revival"", ""Oasis"", ""The Noise We Make"", ""Amazing Grace"", and ""Jesus, Friend of Sinners"". I HIGHLY recommend this. Not bad for a near-30 year old group."""
3,"Works good, but...","I thought i would be able to use the remote from another room, but that isn't possible. It seems the remote is a line-of-sight IR device. I should have done my home work! But it does control quite a hefty load form a set of floodlights outside the house."
2,Been there done that,"Eh..I've read and watched other mangas/animes that have better storylines. This story is not that original, and the fact that the main character has no backbone gets kind of old and annoying. I also couldn't stand the artwork. The characters are not cute at all. It seemed like the author tried to change her drawing style around volume 4 or 5, to try and give the characters more emotion/depth (with the humorous expressions with buggy eyes, dropping jaws, etc.) but it didn't work for me. If you want a better story with blackmail and with better artwork, I highly suggest Peach Girl."
3,Instructions Not Complete,"The instructions do not mention nor show the cable connecting the circuit board in back with the activity light in front. When installing an optical drive there is no room for this cable, as the case clasps the drive tightly. I pulled the activity light out of its hole and coiled up the cable over the circuit board in back, still attached to the board.The completed case with a Pioneer SuperDrive in it worked perfectly. But I would not recommend this kit for a novice.There is no means for cooling a drive, so I would not use this kit on a hot hard drive."
2,not Patrick's best effort,"If you like the Moraz style as best represented by his work with Yes - such as on Relayer, I strongly reccomend you consider buying ""The Story of I"" instead.Windows of Time, is a piano only, one session, format, No dub's etc. While it's not bad, I bought this hoping for similarities to the latin rock fusion sound of Patricks other works ."
4,Balloon Animal Book,"This book is a great book for beginners, it is in black and white so at times it can be hard to see the animal."
2,Overkill in all respects.,"I bought this book after reading a couple others by Mr. Brandvold that were not bad. I am a sucker for romance and happy endings and the story completed in one book. On this one it fails on all accounts. I thought I had a Jake Logan under another name with all the sex and too many bloody killings to count. Some people may like this type of writing but it's not for me. A story that just wandered along with no real ending. Before I buy another Peter Brandfield book, I am going to read the comments very careful. I finished this one only because It was too late to start another book and to pass the evening. Get something for my money. I'll stick with Laurne Paine, Will Cook (Will Henry) Elmer Kelton and a few other new writers I am just coming into contact with."
4,Silk and Shadows,"Silk and Shadow is one of the romantic book I ever read. The book made me realized that falling inlove was not just a fantasy, it was a reality. Sarah and Perigrine were meant to be together. Because of their love what was wrong was made right. Sarah brought Perigrine in the to thougt that vengeance against his enemy was not important. She believes that there was justice to everyone who seeks it. Because they were both deeply inlove nothing can stop their passion. Silk and Shadows was one of the greatest book I ever read. Try it and you'll know what love feels like!"
3,A revised view of Caligula,"Given that everything we've ever heard of Little Boot is of him being a depraved monster in all areas, this book is refreshing in its research and opinions. Obviously, Caligula must have done something right to have all Rome mourn for him at his death, and the author's opinion that he was basically a spoiled immature youth from an upper-class family sounds very familiar pertaining to our world today. However, I did have a problem with the author always trying to make Caligula out to be a misread figure. Too many excuses. But, it's a good researched read ( very well researched) and something out of the ordinary."
3,Well Worth Reading,"Anthony Barrett dispels the myth about Caligula as a demented despot and describes the benevolent contributions Caligula made to the Roman Empire. First, Caligula tried to improve aqueducts, bridges, and other internal improvements. Second, he collected taxes to partly finance buildings for the general citizenship. Previous authors have depicted Caligula as a maniacal tyrant, but this book informed me that Caligula had a sardonic sense of humor that might have irritated those around him. This well researched book adumbrates any previous book about Caligula and provides a useful survey of his life and times."
3,"""SOLO A TU LADO QUIERO VIVIR""","THE ONLY SONG I LIKE IN THIS ALBUM IS ""SOLO A TU LADO QUIERO VIVIR"",IT IS A VERY ROMANTIC SONG, AS FOR THE REST OF THE SONGS THEY ARE JUST SIMPLE."
5,A Welcome Revival,"With the scope TV dramas have today, with the possibility of international locations and virtually no restriction on what can be brought to life in action scenes, I had quite forgotten how things used to be. Claustrophobic static, low-budget sets were the name of the game in British TV drama and comedy of the time, with very few forays into the outside world meant that storylines had to be intriguing and tight, and acting needed to be convincing and on-the-ball. In this respect 'The Sandbaggers' does not disappoint. The stories are just as dark and cynical as you'd expect from a Cold War spy drama. 'Callan' is also a must-have from this genre. It's great to see these 'greats' being resurrected for ardent LWT fans."
4,KISS: Unplugged,Like it a lot! Gave my boyfriend a copy also and he loved it! My Boyfriend really loves Kiss so I have been buying him some items like this one.
2,Puny pamphlets,"2 1/2Despite more than a few moments delivering the warm, fuzzy goods, this disc of dueling desires simply remains a little too brief and filled with corny segments to live up to any standards the names would suggest."
2,book girl,"It arrived broken in the mail. It was packaged pretty well, but we could hear the broken pieces moving around and there was no way to repair it. I contacted the seller, but we were on vacation and a bit of time had passed. It was not expensive, so no big deal, but I won't order any more films through Amazon."
4,Very good reference,"Hi,I was not (and still am) an expert in computer graphics, but my new project I need to struggle with all the topics concerning color, font, floating pictures etc...I need a book to begin with, and this is a good starting point, expecially because it does not force you to keep surfing the web for reference.It gives you a deep coverage of the topic, examples, and for each topic there is a browser compatibily session that helps you to understand where you can use it or not.Max Pellizzaro.http://www.maxpellizzaro.com"
2,Not a single sheet found - too bad I can not return it,"This book is a fairly good review of individual CSS properties, but it never talks about the whole purpose of CSS: having one page that can modify the look and feel of a whole site. If I have to use in-line styles throughout the app, why bother with CSS? When choosing a book on CSS, make sure it mentions external style sheets. I did not find anything about external CSS at all in this book."
2,"not very good, considering their other music","I would skip this one. Government magic is pretty good, so is their latest with money mango . this one... blech."
5,Pleasant Ending of Series.,"CH said she was done with this series, which is too bad, but understandable. I loved the entire series, and how the book/series ended was great. Lily got it together, got her man, and found out she was not barren. She did have one more hey day when she appeared in one of the Sookie books, so she does live on, people! It's good to read this series if you're totally into Sookie because you will find out who the detectives harassing Sookie are because of Debbie Pelt. So, read the series. I also loved that this book let the victim really be the bad guy. It's awesome and says a lot about people."
4,needing lyrics,"I love jennifer knapps music. I am looking for the lyrics and guitar chords for the song ""Refine me"". Does anyone have any idea were I can find christian music lyrics online?"
4,"Great Lyrics, Great Sound","As with her first two albums, Kansas and Lay It Down, Ms. Knapp combines a beautiful sound with meaningful, Christian lyrics. Her sound is rock at times and folk at others.Although this one may not be quite as good as her album Kansas, which is an all time great, it is very good. I would recommend it."
3,Dave collaboration,"This is a strange concept album to figure out. Why didn't Dave just release these songs solo. Hummm? Songs 3-10 are typical Dave with track 3(Miss You) dedicated to the dearly departed Aaliyah.There are some bouncey songs on the album that are filler (In my opinion). Dave Hollister needs no assistance with bangin' out hits. I saw his name affiliated with this album and I figured that it was worth a listen. And I was right, Dave Hollister never disappoints."
1,Tastes really bad,"I love miso soup and was shocked that this soup was so bad. The smell alone was enough to make me want to dump it out. I can't put my finger on what exactly was so bad about it, but after making one cup I threw the box away."
4,One Drawback,"The taste is OK, but not great. The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid. I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time. That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion. Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized). The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it). I just wish there was a better way of packaging. I'm the only one eating it, and maybe that affects my opinion. If you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all, and you can ignore everything I've said."
1,Terrible disappointment,"I loved ""Altered Carbon"" (I constantly suggest it to friends) and thought ""Broken Angels"" was OK (not as good as the first but a decent sophomore effort, stupid twist at the end aside), but this was just a big disappointment. Heavy-handed social commentary masquerading as 3rd-rate science fiction - I should, perhaps, know better than to buy fiction that has a 'suggested reading' post-script, much less one that features Chomsky and Michael Moore. The cutesy bit where the protagonist ends up reading Morgan's first book really pushed me over the edge.Avoid this if you liked ""Altered Carbon"" and pray Morgan can re-find his groove."
3,"It is different, but in a good way","Okay, some people are saying this is not worth buying for because they expected another Keasbey Nights. But they have to understand that they did lose Tomas Kalnoky, singer/song writer. Keasbey Nights is by far their best album, but Dinosaur Sounds is really good. It goes more in the directio that a lot of other bands go with a lot of songs about girls. It isnt bad at all. Ryan Eldred did a one the singing.song writing. I would say go out and buy it, it is worht it, but if you are expecting to hear something that sounds like Keasbey Nights, you should go check out Streetlight Manifesto."
3,Classic,Gave this book to my brother who had been looking for it for years. Was very pleased to receive it. Good price but S&H is way too much.
4,Great workout!,I would definitely reccomend this video as a supplemental workout! She includes just enough cardio to up the benefits of the strength training.
4,OK,"I got this video to mix up my daily workout. I found the moves a little awkward at times, but overall it is a good workout."
1,Overpriced and bad singers,"Ce disque fait partie des cinq opéras de Verdi que Matheson a enregistrés en respectant la version originale (ici, celle de 1847, enregistrée en 1978). Les différences entre les deux partitions sont importantes, surtout à l'acte IV, mais pas assez pour supporter Glossop et Hunter, tous les deux exécrables. Matheson est un chef en général sans intért ; ici, il est mme moins que cela.Comme d'habitude Opera Rara fait payer très cher un disque dont finalement l'intért ne réside guère que dans le livret et la présentation. Pour l'instant cette maison de disques est la seule à proposer cette version en cd (Voce le proposait auparavant en vinyl) et aucune autre marque ne s'est décidée à la commercialiser, ce qui à mon avis est un signe infaillible."
4,Inspirational!,"Go Girl is an excellent book for anyone who wants to listen to the stories of kindred adventurers. The stories are interesting, often humorous, and always engaging. They inspired me to venture out. Elaine Lee's planning and preparation chapter was especially helpful."
4,A lovelly quiet story of an unexpected friendship,"This is the story of an older woman, a widow, played magnificently by Joan Plowright, who moves into a residential hotel for retired people in London. She has hoped to establish contact with her grandson who lives in London but he never returns her calls and she finds herself increasingly lonely. One day she slips and falls in the street and a young man rushes out of his basement flat and helps her. He is as lonely in his own way as she is, and the two form a strange but lovely friendship. The young man is perfectly played by the very romantic looking Rupert Friend.The story is simple and well told. I found the scene where the fellow sings ""For All We Know"" to the woman quite beautiful. Plowright's tears will bring tears to the viewer, I guarantee. Personally I got a little tired of Plowright's character's saintliness and I found the ending quite syrupy/sentimental. But for the most part it's a fine film, well worth watching."
5,Mrs. Delightful !,Mrs Palfrey and Ludo are a delight! I could so relate to the chance meeting of a person who becomes so important to your life. The generational aspect only affirms everyone desires to be known and loved and age is immaterial. If we're open to it coming in unexpected ways it can add to who you are or who you become. 5 stars!!
1,FAULTY COPY,"FAULTY COPY Return was easy but fear your copies may all be that way. It was a gift and embarasssing. I loved the movie when friends got it from another company but this copy from Amazon makes me leery to reorder. My CD of the 4 FRESHMAN is GREAT but when we tried ""Mrs. Palfrey"" on other friend's machines and computersit played for 10-15 minutes and then sputtered and LOCKED UP. This was the EXPENSIVE one with the ""EXTRAS"". {By the way THAT PART WORKED]I know this not a review of the movie but what guarente can you give me that if I reorder you haven't put it back in stock and I'll get it back again?Signed: Dissappointed Old Tom"
3,Pretty boy + Grandma= not working,"This movie was just okay for me a coworker had watched it and liked it so I decided to give it a whirl. It's about this retired widow who decides to move into the claremont hotel in London, by a freak accident she meets this dashing young man who pretends to be her grandson and this leads to confusion and laughs ha ha. This just doesn't seem plausible a story since the young man with his chiseled model looks couldn't possibly befriend this old lady I'm sure he had better things to do."
3,"yes, but",this is a very nice wallet. much too nice for me. it has too many flaps and little pockets that make it bulky and difficult to carry.it was wasteful to buy and goes in the drawer for sure
2,Over-equalized and Sad-Sonic Mess!,"I bought this CD because the Maestro himself was conducting, apparently at the end of his life, and the performances are superb. However, in this Universal branded reissue of a DGG recording, somebody thought it would be ""cool"" to kick up the bass and treble to very high levels, suitable for a boom-box or MP3 player with cheap cans. Sonically, this disk is a mess. This is not the traditional, slightly distant and dry DGG recording that all music lovers know. It may have started out that way, but someone monkeyed with the sound, probably running it through an equalizer set to a ""smile"" pattern, with the bass and treble sliders set way up. The result is loud, shrill, and unlistenable. I really hope that DGG will reissue these recordings with their original mastering intact. Why Universal-a brand unknown in classical music-would rebrand original DGG recordings is beyond comprehension. It is like putting a Yugo badge on a Rolls-Royce!"
2,Good Pic -- Crummy Sound,"Pretty easy plug-n-play board. DVD works great, which is why it got two stars instead of one. But when I turned it to the TV mode the sound was hardly there. Also, what sound there was dropped out every few seconds. Everything was hooked up because I was getting sound, but even at full volume it was barely a whisper.Adjusting the settings was not particularly user friendly either. Help was a joke and there is practically no support as this is an obsolete item.Would I buy it again? Not on your life. I'm shopping around for a different TV tuner video card and am staying as far away from ATI as I can."
1,"It's a wonder, all right!","I have a SONY VAIO RB60G which came with Gigapocket (a Sony tv card) and Windows Media Center and it worked just great. I had upgraded the graphics to an ATI Radeon x800 and 2 Gigs of Ram, so I didnt hesitate to upgrade to Vista Home Premium; big mistake.SONY posted Vista drivers but they did not all work, I lost the tv-tuner. SONY support was its usual ineffectual self. They said I could go back to Windows XP or I could forget about the SONY Gigapocket tv.As I already had an ATI graphics card, I figured their tv-tuner cards would be most compatible.Wrong!The computer under Vista Media Center could not find the tuner, even though it was in the Device Manager list as ""working properly."" ATI has a Media player too (ATI Catalyst), and the tuner did show up in there and it did receive tv signals, but the automatic channel selection did not work, and the audio quality was intolerably static filled.I gave up and got a Hauppauge."
4,Great collection!,"This anthology has a lot of your old horror classics in it. There's versions of The Castle of Otranto, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (my favorite), Dracula, and The Turn of the Screw. The Castle of Otranto has a very interesting forward which dates the story back around 1529. I know Frankenstein was first published in the early 1800s. A good collection of classic horror!"
4,A great movie that takes you back .,I can't believe it's been 20 years since it's release. Watching Roller Boogie really brings back memories of the 80's . It's upbeat and has good music and dancing. ( on skates that is ) They make all kinds of movies these days but I find myself enjoying the movies from the 70's and 80's much more. I hope they release Roller Boogie on video soon. My tape of it has worn out.
5,The Integral Way,"Wow, there are great books, and there a books that leave you in somewhat a query, this book exceeds the ""great book status, and moves to the awesome book status. Aurobindo's awareness is rare, and certainly focuses on devotion to God, rather than, acquiring knowledge. Aurobindo succeeds in relating liberation with the reality of actually knowing and wanting God."
4,Accessible overview of the Protocols of Zion,"This is a very accessible overview of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, its history, the principle players in its creation and distribution, as well as the numerous court cases that have debunked its validity. The text is a bit dry, but it would be very useful in the context of a high school classroom or library."
