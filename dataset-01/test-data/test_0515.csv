5,fun and informative,"This book entrances us, and our 3-year old son (who will listen as long my voice holds out!) It is filled with photographs of fossils, excellent illustrations, and real information. It has none of the silliness and sloppy thinking that most children's books think is acceptable. Instead, it has fascinating, accurate information - organized by topics that are small enough to fit within a 3-year old's attention span, but interesting and educational for me, too. Todlers and adults will get as much information as they can grasp, and all enjoy and learn from the great photos and illustrations."
5,Pretty cool,"I bought the Rocket Warrior Tin. I was opening the packs and pulled two Holos. Out of the Rise of Destany pack I pulled a Ultimate Rare Machine Duplication, and out of soul of the duelist I got a Super rare Greed. I got YZ-Tank Dragon as a rare from Dark Revalation. I might buy the Dark Magician Girl tin next. I'm not a huge fan of Gilford because He would probably have to be put in his own deck. I think you should buy a tin whoever you are from a beginner to a high end player."
3,COMMIN AT CHA,NOT MY FAVORITE ALBUM FROM XSCAPE BUT IT DID SHOW THAT THESE LADIES COULD REALLY SING. THE HARMONIES AND STRENGTH OF EACH MEMBERS VOCALS MAKE THIS ALBUM GOOD. KANDI'S VOCALS ARE AMAZING ON THIS ALBUM AND UNIQUE . THE SISTERS VOCALS BLEND SO NICELY TOGETHER AND TINY PROVIDES THE COUNTRY IN THIS AMAZING GROUP.
5,The Elfin Ship,"If you like Wind in the Willows or The Hobbit, you will love this book. The author describes well our love and appreciation for the comforts of home, but at the same time our natural desire for adventures and excitement on a fantasy quest. Great fun - over and over again."
2,A walk on the weird side,I've read other works fictionalizing Frida Kahlo and I differ greatly from the opinions of the others who claim this was a great read. I felt it was too left field and poorly imagined.
3,"Old ""skool"" Kung Fu For Life!!","First and foremost,,I think the ""Masked Avengers"" is average at best,,infact I believe this is one of my worst venom experience,,and believe me I've seen almost all of them. Based on the hype right here on Amazon, I rushed out to get this SO CALLED collector's item,,,,,,,,,OH PLEASE!! If you're really into the venom crew and hardcore weaponery, check out ""Kid With The Golden Arm"", or ""Chinese Super Ninjas"",,,now these are true collector's item!!"
5,Simply the finest examples of Mozart orchestral playing...ever,"I find it curious how Szell's critics point to the precision of his performances and lack of rubato as an indication that they are devoid of emotion, as though emotion, sloppy playing and excess rubato must come hand in hand. Performing Mozart well means expressing the essence of the work through a careful combination of style, phrasing, pacing and **some** rubato, which Szell does perfectly.Those who are looking for examples of how Mozart should be played by an orchestra, MUST listen to these recordings. Szell's Mozart has consistenly been considered some of the best, but these performances are the absolute top.Phrasing, balance, pacing are all not only perfectly executed, but expertly thought through by Szell. And yes, the performances are very precise."
1,If you are afraid of moving forward...,"Nobody including the government is telling you what choices to make in terms of family work etc.. That's the point! This author chose to be a lawyer, columnist, radio commentator, and political activist while raising her own 6 children. How much time and attention did she give her family?? Yet she chooses to judge those who also try to find a balance with work and family. This author reaps the rewards of social evolution, but doesn't seem to want anybody else to. Figure out what is best for you and your family on your own. So many women have fought for you to be able to do so. If you want to stay home with your children and you can afford to do so - great, but if you want or need to work outside the home there is absolutely nothing wrong with that."
3,"Who wants the re-make...? Where is the 1953 ""classic""...?",Does anyone know where you can get the original movie
2,"1953 original ""The Kidnappers"" is the best!!","My memory of the 1953 ""The Kidnappers"" was that it played in the Kent theatre in Montreal, Quebec, for a record 50+ weeks. It was illegal for children under 16 to go to a movie theatre in Montreal (because of a fire in a movei theatre which took the lives of 70 children) - only to Disney movies accompanied by a parent. So I remember seeing the marquee posting the long success of this movie. I finally got to see it on ""late"" TV one night.It is possible to buy the VHS on-line as part of the British Classics Collection. If you see this first version, you will understand why 'special' Academy awards were given to the two boys who played Harry and Davy."
5,There really are NO LIMITS - Even the Best can Be Better,"""There Are No Limits"" is recommended for challenging yourself to be even better and for continuing to achieve personal growth. In an interesting and easy to read writing style, the Author uses insight and success experiences to teach readers to recognize their own barriers to improved performance. ""There Are No Limits"" provides the reader with useful tools to break free from self-imposed limits and recognize their own true potential. For those who want to discover the secret to being a Superstar in business and life - There are NO LIMITS. Great book. Also recommended by this Author are ""Leadership When The Heat Is On"" and ""Seize the Day""."
5,Great stand. Swivels and Pivots.,This stand adjusts in every way you want. You can even angle it down when horizontal. It swivels vertically and rotates at the bottom without scratching surfaces. The shape of the base allows your keep the original stand connected to it want or are unable to remove it. The torsion adjustment works well and is easy to use once you locate it. Good price. Highly recommended
5,Wonderful product!,"Does what it's supposed to do! I love this product because it's well made, and sturdy. it truly goes up down, tilt back and front, and all the way around. how awesome is that! definitely beats the rinky stiff stand the monitor i have came with. very happy with getting this product and worth the money. the only thing is that since the back is s close to the monitor and vertical, it doesn't have much forward tilt. but still awesome for the bucks. recommend."
5,awsome stand,i took an old samsung 205 bw with a still good screen with a forward leaning stand and made a nice monitor again with it for the price its well worth it highy recomended
3,OK,"I purchased this for my tuneup. I changed the fuel pump, wires, plugs and this fuel filter. After a few days, my fuel pressure decreased, and I had to change this out. Probably a good AC Delco product, but only worked for a few days for me."
3,"So far, so good",I've used the clipper to reach areas my string trimmer can't. I've only used it a couple of times since I bought it and it seems to do what I want it to do. I'll update this review after I've had a chance to use it more.
4,trimmers,These trimmers work great for trimming the shrubs. I also bought the Black and Decker trimmers but they don't hold a candle to these.
3,Not enough power.,"This product worked well, but the power did not last enough for me to get the job done..."
2,Ear busters,The sound is great but after about an hour the lack of padding kills my ears. the individual volume adjustment works well.
5,amazing,"what an amazing book. extremely sad. i felt awful for johnny, even though no one else did (except the author); a good read for anyone who enjoys reading non-fiction; about foster care and the system failing for these children"
4,just the right idea,"The card holders are great. They are easy for little hands and make it easy for kids to hold at least 8-10 cards with minimal fuss. For the price, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them."
1,card holders,do not hold the cards well. the foam in between the two pieces of plastic interfer. They are not like the ones I used to have.
1,Very poor quality,"This item is very poor quality, you need at least 2 hours to epilate legs only. Wow! What a terrible purchase and waste of money."
2,Ended up very disappointed.,"I bought these about one year ago. In the beginning, they sounded good and I was very satisfied. They were used for my computer and were great for that use. Within a few months, as commonly described, the volume control began with the static problems. It was very irritating. The static was very noticeable. Now, one speaker has stopped working. Very poor quality. Ended up very disappointed. I will try the Creative T40 as a replacement."
2,"Sounded great at first, now they're pretty useless","When I first got these, they sounded great. Shortly after the one year warranty, I noticed that only one speaker was playing sometimes. I thought it was my imagination at first, because it seemed to alternate as to which speaker wouldn't be working. Also noticed the crackling any time you touch the knobs. I don't really use the volume knob since computers can adjust the sound, but the volume knob now appears to cause sound to alternate between the two speakers as you adjust the volume. When you stop turning the volume knob, you sometimes end up with stereo sound, but mostly just sound from one speaker. These still sound great when they work right, but Klipsch should be ashamed to have their name on these. I have some $10 computer speakers that have worked for fine for 7 or 8 years, you would think Klipsch could make some pretty high quality speakers for $100."
1,Pieces of junk,"I've had a pair of Klipsch bookshelf speakers for years, and I'm still very happy with them. But these computer speakers are junk.It was only a few months before these speakers started popping, cutting out, dropping one channel or the other, and crackling when the volume was adjusted. A few months of that, and the only way I could get any sound out of them at all was to turn the volume all the way up. A few months after that they stopped working completely. Sure, during the short time they worked, they sounded great, but that's not much consolation for me now.I suspect that most of the positive reviews written below are from people who just bought these speakers. Pay close attention to those reviewers who have had them for more than a few months.Klipsch should be ashamed of this shoddy product."
5,Quality Sound,The sound quality that comes out of these speakers is fantastic! I was looking for great sound with out taking up a lot of space and these fit the bill. Don't expect the base you would get from a set of speakers with it's own base speaker but the base is still very good. I like that you can plug in an I pod or MP3 through a jack on the front of the speakers. Spend a little bit more on a quality sound card to get the most out of these speakers.Sound quality is so good that you will be suprised at how loud you have the speakers turned up until you try and talk with someone.At $74 (including shipping) I'll consider getting another set or two to use with my IPOD throughout the house.Joe - PA
3,"Good speakers, service sucks","I bought this system at the beginning of June. Honestly, the speakers are good: the sound is clear, the size is suitable for both desktop and laptop.However, the klipsch service REALLY SUCKS! After one week use, I found the audio cable (1/8th inch mini plug cable) was defective, then I sent told this to the klipsch support by email. One guy replied that they would send me one replacement soon. After that, I did not receive any email or replacement cable. Then, I sent several emails to them to ask what happened in the following THREE MONTHs, NONE got answered. They did not reply me!!!Althoght I am enjoying the speakers now(with another cable I bought), I have to say that the klipsch service SUCKS!!!"
1,"Travis, do you own stock? These speakers are really bad.","I bought these on special, and they are just TERRIBLE. Murky sound, things I am so used to hearing in my music are just GONE. Bass is nothing to write home about. The whole sound platform is just muddy. No clarity or precision at all. Especially at low volumes, you'd think you were holding a pillow over the speakers. Unfortunately I can't return these because they were sitting in the box for a month while I was OS."
5,Honoring our heros while telling an important story in history,"My great aunt, Sarah Catherine Leach Faeth, is a part of this documentary. My great aunt was an amazing woman. Never have I enjoyed an emotional roller coaster quite like I did while I was watched this documentary. This dvd is not only a wonderful way to honor the brave men and woman that served in the 77th evacuation unit but also to tell their story...one that I wish I would have asked my aunt about more while she was still alive."
3,sears lawnmower battery charger,"seems to work fine, hard to tell as my battery was still charged from previous charger, but put charger on , left it all night, unplugged it, and mower started right away, am pleased!"
3,In The Devil's Snare,"Make sure you have plenty of water or other beverage at your side when you read this book. It's so dry, you will find yourself thirsty for a better writing style. I read lots of books and I was very eager to read this one; having read the prior reviews, I thought it would be an interesting historical account of the events of that era and topic. I got 70 pages in to the book and finally gave up. I don't know why but the presentation was boring. I found the author's style too clinical and choppy, somehow. If you are determined to read this book, wait 'till it comes out in paperback or buy it used. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy it in HB."
5,witch trails,This book is very interesting and a lot of research went into to it. Gives excellent details on the trails & how all this came to be. What a terrible thing to have happened in this young country.
2,very old product close to expiry,Though the price is good but the product has an expiry of 01/2013 which means its very old. Very disappointing.
5,Just like in the store only cheaper.,Exact same thing I get at the pharmacy only HALF THE PRICE! Shipped in a few days and they work great. I rarely get any errors with these strips and the drums are much easier to use than the strips you have to put in individually.
1,disappointed but maybe i expected too much,I'm a big fan of Nassim Taleb so I was very interested in why he said this book was his favorite book on finance. I also had a similar experience to this author which further heightened my expectations. it's a quick read - took me about five hours - but I am still wondering what Taleb saw in it. They must be friends. There's really nothing substantial here.
1,don't be fooled,"Please do not be fooled into thinking that this is a ""Venoms"" flick. This is a terrible labeling error. It has Chang Shieng and Lu Feng, but it is not worthy of being anywhere in the same class as ""Five Deadly Venoms"" or either ""Flag of Iron"" for that matter. Please, do not be tricked into buying into this garbage of a movie. It tried to come off as a horror-tinged kung fu flick, but it is a total waste of time. I love all of the Venoms and there movies, but I think that they are trying to pull one over on us here. Why couldn't they release ""Masked Avengers"" instead? I don't even think they should bill it as a venoms flick unless it has at least three if the originals in it. This one has only two!!! It was painful to sit through this movie... What a waste of money!!!"
1,complete waste of money,"I brought this because my kids love spongebob & ice cream..perfect toy, right? WRONG! The ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone. We have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then I have a huge mess left in the kitchen."
4,Fun but messy,The ice is too difficult for my first grader to shave for the sno-cones. The ice-cream serving function is way too messy to bother with. My son loves everything Spongebob - he loves it anyways.
4,good gift,"I gave this to a boy turning 4 who has a 7 year old brother, and as soon as I gave it to him the two boys worked together to make a snow cone. I was surprised at how easy it was for the 7 year old to crush the ice, while I supervised. I think it was a good gift and the shipping was quick too."
1,Not compatible with the iPod Touch,"I read other reviews for this product and some of them said it was compatible with the iPod Touch, unfortunately for me, it wasnt. Quite honestly, I still dont know how to operate the adapter, the instructions weren't very clear especially for the touch. I just went ahead and bought the motorola adapter, it's much nicer looking anyway."
2,"Works, with some issues","Very cheap plastic - the cover plate with the button fell off the day I received it. Some super glue has kept it together so far. The single ""on"" button is too small to press without angling your fingernail or using a pen or other small device.Pairing instructions are not quite right - you have to hold the button for 15 seconds or more and the lights flash very rapidly - if you only hold for 6-8 seconds they will flash rapidly, just not very rapidly - misleading.Device requires frequent repairing with the Motorola headphones.Sometimes the unit will not recharge, you have to plug in, take out, re-plug in the cord many times.If you have a skin for your IPOD you have to press it in very hard to get full contact - it will pair, but no sound unless you push it in all the way.Sometimes the IPOD will not mount on the PC when connected through the USB cable and simultaneously on the TEN unit.Since the other units are even worse, this still may be the best bet."
4,great bluetooth adapter!,"I have had this bluetooth adapter for about 3 years and have been very satisfied with it overall. I originally bought it for an iPod nano (that has since broken) and was happy that it comes with various clips to hold different sized ipods. I replaced the nano with a 1G iPod touch and once again, the adjustable clips fit it perfectly. The only thing that I don't like about it is it's bulkiness. I usually use my iPod while working out and it is somewhat difficult to find an armband that will accommodate such a large piece of equipment. Other than that, the performance has been stellar! Highly recommended!"
1,Garbage,Not only was this cheaply made but it didn't work and more importantly it was designed poorly for being used while moving. The company who makes it has gone defunct so there is no support
3,Not the best quality,Got what I paid for. The quarter inch adapter falls off. Poor fit. The case keeps opening. Very poor quality.
4,A true look at the struggle to make a living on the prairie.,"These days many people idolize the life on the prairie as ""life in the slow lane"" The Thresher shows the determination and brutality of purpose that it takes to make a living on the prairie. It shows the struggle to adapt to changing technology as horses were replaced with steam powered threshers at the turn of the century. This book also tells of the dangers of farm work and the effect of the fear of injury has on women. My only reservation about the book is the over use of forshadowing."
4,Bionicle AIN'T scary!! They freakin' awsome!,"okay,I'm a bionicle fanatic(not like the loser kind, though) and I read one review, and:Wierded out!It said a toa vakama set scared the crap out of this guys kid, he ran out of the room CRYING and refused to play with it!(what the-hello is any one listening to me?)I think they're pure eye candy!! Anyways I like the metru nui series A wee bit more then the other series. I just like the way the toa look more then the toa nuva. These toys are AWSOME!!They're durable,fun, very fun if you have a large imagination!! And it's kinda educational, teaching good building skills! I recomend any bionicle to anyone. And they're not scary, trust me."
5,"educational, but FUN !!",mnay people say that building things takes a lot of hard work and lots of brains lego is almost the same thing first you have to use your BRAIN to make the thing second after the toy is finished you could play and play does mean to have fun with a toy or game making this bionicle also takes patience which parents likes in children and concentration which parents also like so if your parent or your self thinks this is a good toy your wrong its an AWSOME toy
5,Imagination time with lego,My cousin and i really enjoy lego. It is educational cause u have to be paticant if u r young(like my cousin) and it teaches u to USE ur mind think of things to make up with them ( by them i mean legos) combine them to make 1 or more things. And the look on there face when the finish constructing them is PRICELESS. They r very very worth the money and efort to press the add to card button hehehe.
1,One Poor Choice,"I have purchased several large Grizzly machines in the past and will not be buying any more. The drill press manual is sketchy at best. Changing speeds is a hassle. The belts that came with the press were lousy as they caused much vibration, even in a unit as heavy as this press. The table isn't solid as is shifts no mater how tight I set it. Delivery was a chore. To true the table I had to purchase a 1 3/16 inch socket. I'll give it to one of my sons and probably get the new Powermatic that is coming out this month."
3,Three for the power of money is more like it,"It has a few gems, but this is for ELP completists only, it's not that bad, but it smells like it was made to make money, you can't blame them, Emo and Palmer were probobly broke at the time, ya gotta eat!highlights...Talkin' Bout(the hit and a good Yamaha GX-1 synth hook)Desde La Vida: (l) La Vista/(ll) Frontera /(lll) Sangre De Toro(the prog piece/very good)Eight Miles High(I really like this dancey pop version in a weird way)On My Way Home(Tribute to the late manager of The Nice Tony Statten-Smith)"
4,Nice,This is a great Bronson Movie. They don't make movies like this anymore. No political correctness here. Raw Bronson they will never show this on TV so buy the video for full effect.
3,Some nice vocal trance music,"A reasonable collection of vocal trance music. The only 4 songs that really stood out for me were:- Accuface - ""Pure Energy""- Aveda feat. Corrie - ""2 Souls""- Talla 2xlc - ""Carry Me""- York feat. Asheni - ""Mercury Rising""A good cd to build one's ultimate vocal trance set."
3,"Awesome...not really awesome, but good.","Good collection of bikes, left out some premier ones like the VStar, but in all a good video."
2,Not worth the price,It is over priced for what it does. Pieces that are opened don't fit well in the cheap holder. You need to pull off all the parts that are opened in the holder and it makes a mess
4,Puccini Arias - Farrell,Ms. Farrell is a favorite performer and we previously owned this collection on LP. We knew what we were buying and we got what we counted on.
1,"Should be ""Christian Girlfriends' Getaway""","Or maybe ""Weekend with Jesus and the Girls"". I get very frustrated when authors don't tell you up front that a book that sounds as if it is for every woman is actually full of religious messages. My girlfriends and I would no sooner pray over each other than eat ""cheese and crackers"" on ""hoity toity night"" or pack fake doggie doo or a whoopee cushion for laughs!It doesn't take all of the psychological manipulation of your sisters that they describe in this book to create strong female bonds. The truth comes naturally and doesn't require scheduled sessions of prayer, nor does it require scripted questions that are meant to break someones spirit and build an artificial need for the group. Plan your own weekend... and just have fun!"
2,Soundtrack is missing Bonita Applebum Remix,I was disappointed the Soundtrack didn't have the Bonita Applebaum Hootie Mix. I can't find that mix anywhere except on Vinyl.
2,This Is Kind Of Weak,"The songs by Usher and Stevie Wonder are the only two decent tracks on here. Everything else is just whatever. Janet Jackson's song ""Again"" isn't even on here."
3,"Does anyone know who plays the jazz version of ""Again""?","....It's not on the soundtrack, but it is played throughout the movie...Please help by posting the name of the artist. Thank You!"
5,The magic modern german art.,"I found in Amazon this great book, of one of the most important painters that headed the modern art in painting in germany. It is very difficult to find books from this artist, part of the Blue Rider Grup (Der Blaue Reiter). So it is great that amazon provided us with such a treasure."
4,Birthday Gift,My son loves this Curious George book. He loves when I read it to him almost every night before bed.
2,"Hamster ""car""",With the picture shown I thought I was getting the car and when I received my purchase it was not what I was expecting.
4,Tastes Good/Good for You,"These chips taste good and are good for you. They have a slightly gritty aftertaste but not worse than other ""good for you"" chips. They are very lightly salted. The only drawback is having to buy them in such a large quantity."
4,Great Follow Up,"One of the few bands that is carry the stoner torch is Nebula. Their last effort, Atomic Ritual was a solid but albeit derivative effort that relied too much on stoner rock conventions. However, it has improved with time, meaning that the record does not sound out of date a couple of years after its release.Apollo is a bit more polished and solid. The whole album can be played through with ever having to skip a track. The band seemed to have more fun with this one then their other records. This is evident since the songs do not sound forced or anything. As a result, this records is the kind you can just have a beer to.If you like stoner rock or just chill out music, pick up apollo. It's nothing too serious, but its of serious quality so it comes highly recommended. Put it on when you have a small gathering of people. They will love for it."
2,Monster Magnet rip-off,"I was pretty excited to hear this album but then after listening to it I came to the conclusion that it is a poorly done Monster Magnet ripoff. The music is boring, the lyrics are lame, and the singer cannot sing. They seem to want to fit into that ""Look how spaced out and cool we are"" category and it just comes across as being forced. Don't get me wrong, I love some of Nebula's older stuff, but this is just lame."
4,Brumberg hits the Adolescents life with a near bulls-eye,"As an adolescent female myself, I loved the truth that this book conveys. Brumberg hits the nail on the head wether discussing the 'hymen' and it's role or zits and hair. If people plan on raising adolescents, spend time with adolescents, or are adolescents this book is a must read. I LOVED IT."
4,Good book for adoption,"I love this series of books, but I bought this one by mistake. It's about adoption which doesn't apply to my children. Great for adopted children!"
5,WONDERFUL!,"I recommend this book to all adoptive parents. It's so endearing and everything your looking for in a book for ""us"". :)"
3,Just keep in mind that all children are different.,"While I adore Jamie Lee Curtis and enjoy her writing style I think it is very important to remember that all children are different and all reactions are different.One reviewer, an adoptee, mentioned that ""bitter adoptees"" are few and that they would have had emotional issues regardless. This is wholly inaccurate and adoption needs to be looked at not only through the nice, warm, teddy bear thoughts expressed here but through reality as well. This is a base for a discussion and that discussion must include loss. Adoption requires a loss of family for the child. Never forget that children grieve and never allow the warm-fuzzies to replace a clear view of what the child is going through.I am also an adoptee. I love my family and encourage anything that starts a dialog as long as it is a true dialog and not edited by something read in a book or on a review."
5,Inspired my daughter to create HER story,"This is an engaging and inspiring book. My daughter loves when we read this one together. Curtis captures very well the magic of that first night and those first few days. She does it so well that any child can appreciate this book, regardless of how their family was put together. This book, naturally, had my daughter asking about the night she was born, over and over. Eventually, she asked me to make a story book for her about the night she was born. She was so inspired by this book! We put together her book with her favorites parts of her first few days, scrapbook style. Now, we read both books together. These magic moments are why we want to become parents to begin with! Thank you, Jamie, for such a wonderful gift."
2,Buy the book -- not the excerpt!,"I bought the 2 page excerpt of this book and was very disappointed. While it reviewed the 5 key messages to avoiding burnout, I would have rather spent $15 on the whole book to get more content than spend $6 on a very brief summary."
2,can`t see the mean eye,"TOA NOKAMA element:water tools:twin hydroblades mask:kanohi rau,great mask of translation.allows the user to translate and communicate in any written or spoken language.toa nokama .......I DON`T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN!!!!!!!!! IT`S BEEN ONLY 2WEEKS SINCE I GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!! CAN`T A KID KEEP HIS SECRETS TO HIM SELF!?!?!?!? THE END"
5,Revealing a harsh life,"I don't usually read biographies, but a friend sent me this one and I was intrigued by the title. I'm glad I gave the author a chance. Rita Williams tells a compelling story of growing up in the often not-so-tender embrace of her Aunt Daisy. Through her rich, colorful descriptions that felt more like paintbrush strokes on a canvas than words on a page I imagined myself transported to the simple cabin in Colorado in which Ms. Williams grew up. Through powerful dialogue I came to know the matter of fact, domineering and cruel personality that was Daisy. Through the pages I often found myself fearing for Ms. Williams' sanity and security. In the end however, the story shows how the author not only survived but thrived and took command of her own life. This is a remarkable story of growth of spirit."
1,SPOILED IS COPY CONTROLLED,"This CD is ""COPY CONTROLLED"". Will not play on my computer and Itunes certainly won't turn it into MP3s. This makes is useless to me. I listen to music on my iPod or computer. I know there are hacks around this, but I have this wierd idea that if I legally bought it I should be able to play it."
5,A TOTALLY UNDERRATED CLASSIC,"Was a pity that Steve Howe didn't work on this album and therefore the promotion of the album and the tour was cancelled. Only four tracks was recorded after Alpha with Steve Howe on an album called Aurora released only in Japan. Sincerely I prefer songs like Astra instead the third album than it should have been with Steve Howe.I'm an Asia fan for 10 years and since I discover them, this album didn't stop being my favourite. All tracks (except ""love now till eternity"") deserves to be heard.Without any doubt, a jewel that every lover of 80's music MUST have in his collection."
3,"The weakest Asia album, but still pretty good","Astra almost had to be a slight disappointment after two really good albums. This is mainly because there is more filler on this one, including ""Countdown to Zero"", probably the weakest track in Asia's history. But what's good here is as good as anything on the first two albums, and there are even signs of some development and progression, a further tightening of the band's sound in some of the better numbers."
1,street of dreams,"These stories are heartfelt, intense, passionate and personal. They are however presented dreadfully, on photocopied poorly typewritten cheaply bound paper. I thought buying books online would be safe, until this poor excuse for a ""book"" arrived in the mail. Buyer beware."
3,THE VERY BEST -- Almost!,"Firstly, somebody somewhere needs to compile a ""true"" BEST OF Anthology for the superbly talented (and oft ""overlooked"") DAVE MASON. I realize that there are possibly legal protections which only ""restrict"" and ""hinder"" such a worthy compilation - due to the fact that several recording companies might be in conflict to allow the sharing of rights (thanks to our great and fair ""Legal System"" ... which SUCKS!). Anyway, this CD is a very nice compilation, but what I really HATED was that the final 3 songs (the very BEST tracks that I really wanted more than most) were ""dreaded"" LIVE versions!!! That of course is my personal preference, because I always prefer UNEDITED STUDIO versions whenever possible. Also, a SECOND DISC could have offered this option -- a few LIVE versions included ... plus including few other hits which could have been added from albums such as LET IT FLOW, SPLIT COCONUT and MARIPOSA DE ORO. Overall, not a bad CD - but the VERY BEST ?? ... well, ALMOST."
5,I love this product...,"Just getting so hard to find, I buy all I can get when I see it for sale. Well worth the price, Bravo Almay, but please make it more available."
2,Does not work in Epson 837 printer,Worked ok with older HP printer. Printer died and replaced with Epson 837.. This paper will not work at all with Epson ink. Nothing I could do to the settings would make it come out even close to decent...Kodak and Epson paper works great in the new 837 but not the HP stuff.
4,Punk you can actually understand,"Maybe not good for your mother's ears, but excellent for everyone else. Funny but biting, Harsh but not screaming vocals. Raw sound, but not amatuerish (sp?). Good song composition which is rare for a punk band."
5,Best Nozzle Out There,"I bought this to replace my dad's old nozzle of the same model. Over 25 years of use nearly every day caused the brass tube to keep separating from the valve body. He tried gluing it multiple times only having temporary success. I'm sure he would continue to keep gluing it for the next 20 years, but I didn't want to have him keep doing that so I got this as a gift for him. I'll probably inherit it someday.The valve has very good modulation and a good feel."
2,LCD screen broke in less than 2 weeks,"LCD screen broke in less than 4 weeks, it still takes pictures but I cant see what I am looking at."
4,Kodak C653,The Kodak C653 is a great camera for the price. Easy to use point and shoot. The batteries seem to last a long time and the camera is durable. I dropped it (hard) on the sidewalk last weekend and it suprisingly worked afterword. Minor drawbacks are: A little to long of wait between pictures and it looses the date and time if the batteries are left out to long.
2,First Time I've Been Disappointed With a Kodak,"Though Kodaks aren't known as a top quality photgraphic tool, this is the first time I've ever been disappointed in one. I've owned other Kodaks, but this one didn't give the picture quality I expected. It hasn't been used since the first time for this reason. The higher end Kodak Easyshares, such as the 700 series and up are great and are incredible values, but this one I cannot recommend."
1,Way too graphic,"This book shows an age range of 4-8. After hearing about the book, I decided to buy it to help my curious 6 year old understand the difference between boys and girl, etc. After I received it, my husband and I both decided to return it. It goes into detail about what an orgasm and sex feels like. That is not something a small child needs to know. We ended up getting ""It's Not the Stork"" which was way more age appropriate. It explains the difference between boys and girls, how a baby is made and grows, etc. It also has a section about ok touch and not ok touch which I think is important for a child to learn."
3,Pictures are a little much...,"Other than the picture of mommy and daddy in the bath tub together, I think this is a pretty good book. It puts this part of life in todler terms. If you are easily offended by graphics, don't buy this book."
1,Way too much sexual detail!,"There is NO WAY my kids need to know how sex feels in a play by play description. All I wanted was a book that would talk about what sex was in a factual manner. This was like reading soft porn with cartoon graphics aimed at kids! At ages 4 and 7, this is beyond their years for a need to know. I am glad I read it at the book store before buying it. I couldn't believe all the great reviews it had. Maybe for a 10 year old (or older) but not for young kids IMO."
5,A Classic,"I first read ""Where Did I Come From"" as a 10 year old. I remember sitting at the table with my mom, as page by page, we went through the illustrations and text. I have never forgotten the experience. ""Where Did I Come From"" combines a ""no-frills, tell it like it is"" approach to reproduction, and combines it with some of the best analogies (an orgasm is described as being satisfying in the manner of a great big sneeze, for instance), and some of the most wonderful illustrations I have ever seen. The book illustrates nudity, but the ""Mom and Dad"" are pleasantly plump, and completely unthreatening, even to a small child.I have since read the book to my now 13 year old son, and will undoubtably read it to my 3 year old when the time comes.I can't give this book high enough praise. It has EARNED a permanent spot on my bookshelf."
1,"""Where did I come from?""","""Too much information"" is an understatement. I gave this book a one star because there was nothing lower. I consider this book very inappropriate for children. If you are trying to raise your children with morals and values and not to do what ""feels good"" skip this book and try another. Children emulate what they see. A cartoon picture of a man on top of woman having sex is something unexpected in a childrens book and better kept at the adult book store.Thanks for sharing, but no thanks!"
1,Buyer beware,"I bought this book for my children before having read it completely through - and discovered afterwards that I simply cannot bring myself to even let them look at it. The descriptions of body parts, functions, etc. are fine and humorously presented, but is it necessary to go into how ""nice"" sex is, with all the description? Especially when there's no accompanying discussion of the responsibilities of sex. This section of the book comes across as having been written by a ""naughty boy"" trying to shock. If I could rip out the pages about ""making love"" without wrecking the book, I'd like it a whole lot better."
1,Plea From Adult Survivor of Sexual Abuse: Don't Buy Book!!,"I was given this book at age 9 by mom to help me understand sex. Here is the scary thing I was being sexually abused by my adult uncle from the age of 3 until I was 12. This book ended up normalize my abuse by relating every day experiences like jumping rope and being tickled to sex! If you think sexually abuse can't happen in your family I am sorry but it can happen to any family. My parents are both teachers and happily married. Our house was nicknamed the ""Cleaver's"" by my friends. We went to church on Sunday mornings and both my brother and I sang in the children choir at church. As an adult survivor of sexually abuse I am asking you to not buy this book for your children. Any book that compares sex to childhood activities is not book you should use to teach your children about sex."
1,Where Did I Come from?,"Okay, I'm a kid. 13 to be exact, and ever since the 2nd grade, my school reads this to us. Every year. Then, the show the movie version which has these sperms in top hats and ties. The egg is some sort of a ballerina. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that even when I was an innocent little seven year old, I knew the stuff they were teaching and so did everybody else in the school. Not to mention the pictures are very graphic. They have this naked lady and guy in the same bathtub. So they distract us with these shocking pictures while they try to explain boring stuff like semen? I mean, come on. Give it up. Then, they try to tell us what sex is. They show these two cats purring and and rubbing against each other while romantic accordian music plays. I dunno, if you think you're going to teach someone anything about where they came from, don't use this book. Telling them they came from a stork would sound more convincing than the way they tell it here."
1,Some good basic content but GRAPHIC!,"The book has good basics but is too graphic in my opinion to use as a sexual guide for children. I would think that explaining ""the penis enters the vagina"" would be adequate but going on to describe the ""thrusting in and out"" and orgasm detail to be just too much. What's with the ""Tickling"" description? It would seem very confusing to equate sexual feelings with tickling. As a parent, I have tickled my kids, as most of us have. Imagine if after this book your child thought this was sexual in nature!I will pick and choose what info I deem appropriate for my children and leave out the rest.Also- what's with the obesely overweight naked cartoon people in the book? Is this the image you want your children to strive for?"
2,Better ways out there,"I checked this book out in a local bookstore, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in it. I didn't like the overall ""masculinity"" of the book as a whole. They give names to female anatomy that I don't think are conducive to a child's learning of the physiology of humans, and yet the male parts are given straight forward names. Why do the female ones get slang words instead?I wasn't happy with the effort put into describing all aspects of sex. Why do children need to know exactly what it feels like, what it looks like, etc? Really, shouldn't they just learn that it's an expression of love and they'll learn the rest soon enough? Don't children have enough on their plates as it is without them having to deal with graphic sexuality at such young ages?I truly feel the best way to talk to your child about sex is to do just that, talk to them. Don't just go buy some book and hand it to them and expect that to work."
2,"SORRY, IT'S JUST NOT THE BEST BOOK ON THE SUBJECT","I needed a book to help me teach my children about basic sex education--""the birds and the bees"", an accurate book, one written and illustrated in a simple and enjoyable manner, and one my kids would find easy to understand and enjoyable. What I discovered was that the best book on the market is not this -- it is one recommended to me and which I wound up purchasing on Amazon. It's title is HOW BABIES ARE MADE by Andry and Schepp from Time Life Books and Little, Brown & Company."
4,A Sound Basic Review of Financials,A sound review of what I learned almost 40 years ago and have not used in about 25 years. Brought back what I learned and used years ago.
3,"Be warned - the author is no expert - he makes a big ""rookie"" mistake","The author says: ""Retained Earnings can be viewed as a pool of money from which future dividends can be paid"". This is not only incorrect, it is stupidly incorrect. The retained earnings account represents the accumulated income not paid out in dividends that has been invested in the firm assets - its money already spent. As part of the Liability/Shareholder Equity side of the Balance Sheet, it is a claim on assets, not an asset itself. So there is no pool of money to pay future dividends which is the type of mistake that puts a question mark on the the entire book's content. I still give it a three star because I do like the detailed and interesting format and very readable design concept."
5,Henry VIII and His Queens,"I have collected many books about Henry Tudor. Although this book reads like a history book, the details behind the reasons for his marrying so many women, the religious upheaval and the political situations of the times makes is a great book."
3,Will the real story please stand up?,"Diane Duane is by far my most favoraite Star Trek author and I would have bet long odds that any book that she wrote is a ""must have"". However, 'Swordhunt' and 'Honor Blade' proved this assumption to be totally wrong.There just seems to have a 'whole lot of nothing' going on in both stories. Correction: You have one somewhat hectic Star Trek shot-em-up style space battle in each book . . . and the rest of the story (??) so far seems to be in a continuation that has not yet been printed.I have read and re-read both books a number of times and I have yet to have any clue as to what is actually going on.No doubt, if and when we actually get to the *real* story . . . in the next volume . . . all this seemingly wasted effort telling a back story will make sense . . . but as it is now, be prepared to be disappointed."
2,BAD BUSHING DESIGN,"The bushing is oil lite which is soft. Putting it in the door it fit fine but putting the pin in it crutched it up. There is no need for that type material there. A regular brass bushing would have been better. Now, I'll have to get one made at a machine shop around here, somewhere. I am not sure if Dorman's is the same as or a replica of Chevrolet's version but whether it is or not I am not putting that back in.Oillite works in places such a drive chains, ( motorcycles, conveyors and such ) but the door moves 30 - 40 degree slowly. It's not necessary. I not bother to send it back. Another waste of time and money, either way."
2,Plastic Box,The material for the organizer is a simple cheap plastic box. Would not recommend for a person trying to organize their drawers. Nothing special about this box.
1,Save Your Money for Something Better.,"Don't waste your hard earned money on this worthless piece of future recyclable. I purchased this to transfer liquids and all it does is leak and make your hands and clothes smell of the liquid your transferring. Additionally, it's hard to keep the hoses reasonably straightened for transfer purposes as they like to curl (see the product picture). Might be a good siphoning concept in this form, but the materials used are better served recycled into something else. I suppose if you make and market a shoddy product and only about half get returned, you still made a tidy bundle."
3,It works,It works. What else do you need to know? Don't put your mouth to it. IDIOT! just squeeze it. Mmmmmk?
3,Great for any emergency,"During Hurricane Sandy, the came in very handy when I didnt want to take my car and wait on the long lines, Instead I took the 14 gallon drum , filled it up and then used this to get the gas into my truck. Worth the money."
3,"Not bad for the money, but not great","I got a handful of these for the car emergency kits, and after testing one out, it's not bad for the low price.Yes, the hose can be stiff when uncoiling if it's cold, but that's a problem with any plastic tube siphon. The tube is also pretty small on the inside diameter, which makes it a bit slow, but it works. A larger tube would be faster, but would be a bulkier as well.If you're looking for something fast or for using on viscous liquids like oil, probably best to look elsewhere. For a small, inexpensive emergency kit item, it's doing the job fine."
4,"It does the job, but the tube curls too much....","This is a convenient siphon to carry when you don't have much space. It works fine, but it's hard to keep the siphon going because the tube curls too much and doesn't stay at the bottom of the container being siphoned."
3,Review,"This book gave good details into wagering online, however, I found that it lacked the details of a truely great betting book. It's a little thin on the online world of betting.Travis NewmanCasino Watchdogshttp://www.casinowatchdogs.com"
3,ok not her best,not her best. glad i bought it used and didn't pay full price. it seems like she doesn't mention anything about God until the very end of her programs and i doesn't seem to fit with the overall theme.
5,Absolutely Adorable!,"This picture frame is absolutely adorable! The colors are beautiful and it can coordinate with almost anything! I have the gossamer wings nursery set, but this frame would be pretty in any little girls room with a similiar theme or colors."
2,THPS4,"Since THPS2's trick system was basicaly broken I haven't tried another GBA Tony Hawk again. If you have access to a PS2, XBOX, GameCube, or even a PSX, get it on there instead. You'll enjoy it a lot more."
4,GETS BOREING AFTER PLAYING 4 A FEW WEEKS,SWEET GAME BUT GETS BOREING AFTER A PLAYING IT FOR A WHILE....FROM CANADIAN SK8 CHIKP.SGIRLS SK8 BETTER THAN BOYS!!!!!!!!!!
4,A brilliant book,"Playing Indian provides a serious argument in the debate over what American identity is. Deloria proves that although white America has traditionally considered itself as an original and true nation, white Americans have proved less secure about their national identity. In this book Deloria identifies numerous attempts by white Americans to recreate themselves as authentic Americans by assuming Native American identities. A must for anyone interested in American history."
2,Depending on what you are after...,"If you are after a paractical book with plenty of real world examples then this isnt your book. Try The Software Project Manager's Handbook: Principles that Work at Work by Dwayne Phillips.This book reminds me of Info Science text books - plenty of information about things you should do, but little actual depth on how to do them. The book is mainly theory but still has some reasonable points. I wouldnt recommend anyone rush out and buy it though."
1,"Too general ... no case studies, examples, best practices","Book provides very general high level overview of PM. It does not get into details such as case studies, examples or best practices, documentation etc. You can read the same information on the web freely."
3,Too general for an IT professional.,"There are too few of real world examples on how the activities or standards are applied. Although no doubt that human communication is important, but I think some good examples will make the technologies understand better on how to manage IT projects in a proper way. I think, this book is more suitable as keynotes instead of a primary reference book. If you are serious about putting some standards to your IT projects, try to check out the book titled ""Quality Software Project Management"", ISBN#0130912972."
2,"Mile Wide, Inch Deep","The book reads like a mediocre project plan; the Mr. Murch attempts to enumerate all aspects of project management, but provides no personal insight. Showing a complete lack of orginality, the writer accompanies the lists with common, useless fillers. ATTENTION MANAGEMENT BOOK WRITERS: The world does not need another two pages on Maslow.Granted, the book has thorough lists of tasks involved in the Software Development Lifecyle. Keep in mind, however, that the book doesn't really explain HOW to do any of the tasks. If you're looking for a clue on how you can avoid another behind-schedule, over-budget fiasco, look elsewhere."
1,Wish I'd paid attention to the negative reviews,"Bought this chair for a week long trip to the beach, and am extremely disappointed. As other reviewers have noted, this chair is not made for average adults. It is extremely narrow, poorly made, and has jagged, unfinished edges. I tore my bathing suit on a jagged piece of metal protruding from the chairs side. Can't think of a single positive thing to say about this chair, and I will be returning it."
2,Dissappointed,"I purchased 2 similar chairs 2 years ago from the same manufacturer. I was exceptionally pleased with the quality and comfort.I decided to purchase 2 more this year...same item, same manufacturer. The new ones are much inferior to my originals. While the aluminum frame appears to be the same, both the wooded arm rests and the chair fabric are narrower and cheaper...really cheap.The new chairs were about $5 cheaper than my originals...and a lot less than $5 in quality."
3,Old reviews,I was curious why all the reviews are so old? Is this old product? We all know that product quality changes from year to year.
2,Neither Hi-Back Nor Deluxe,"The representation and description of this product is extremely misleading. The chair is small and not very wide. The back of the chair lines up with my shoulder blades (I'm 6 feet tall) and is not comfortable. The head pillow is no larger than a brick. Consider this chair only if you are a petite person (less than 5 feet and 100 pounds). Very disappointed with this purchase. Also, beware of this seller's shipping charges--they are steep. I was aware of this but was swayed by the overwhelming majority of favorable reviews."
2,Very Narrow. Better chairs out there,"Chair is very narrow--anyone over 175 lbs is not going to fit comfortably in this chair. Cup holder is flimsy. After changing positions and you sit back in the chair, the chair goes back to the first positon. You have to be completely still or the chair will default back into the first position. Very heavy compared to other chairs. I would shop around."
2,didnt work,I gotthis because I was having a nitir problem after cleaning the gravel with the gravel vav it made my water very cloudy have been working for 2 weeks trying to fix the water after using this
1,This is not what I ordered Amazon!,"I had been using Tetra easy balance with NITRABAN for a long time and it is a great product which is why when all the stores in my area stopped selling it I was upset and wondered what I would do to maintain my aquarium wihtout it. I was happy to find it on Amazon.com and ordered a Big bottle of it. After waiting almost a week to receive it I found that they shipped me the same thing that the stores in my area are now carrying, which doesnt work. I do not understand why when I placed the order it said it was ""w/ Nitraban"" but they instead shipped me something else. This sucks."
3,Item not as pictured,"I ordered these because they are pictured with Elmo on the cup, and my daughter likes Elmo. The product I received has the Zoe character on the cup, and there is no sign of Elmo. While the cups are nice, they are not what I thought I was ordering nor what I wanted."
1,DEFECTIVE,"So upset about this purchase! My son was so excited to get his dvd and did not understand why it wouldn't work. Why would anyone sell something that does not work, seriously people we are talking about little kids!"
4,Moms like Dinothunder too,"I found this version of Power Rangers refreshingly updated. I enjoy watching it with my boys- 3 and 7. As mentioned by the previous review, this version does a good job blending things. It's not so painfully disjointed as previous versions and the new SPD version comming in February. Since power rangers seem to advance on a regular basis from one color to another does it really matter if Tommy was a white ranger at one point? He's a black ranger now. It all gets very confusing since there seem to be many, many types, colors and combinations of rangers."
3,A true fan,"Anyone who babbles about Anti-Flag ""riding the anti establishment bandwagon"" has obviously never listened to them. Ya this record may be a little more mellow but dont accuse them of being something they're not. Anti-Flag has always been Pro Peace and Anti War. Support the warrior not the war. Bring them home now."
5,Great intro to the huge world of nanotechnology,"Read most of this book on a week's vacation and I loved every bit of it. Gives great examples of the power of nanotechnology even though it was written in the 80's. Once you get through the first couple of chapters, which are mostly overview of how the machines could be produced and defining terms, the author begins to make light of the tremendous possibilities that nanotechnology will bring to the world. Mostly deals with living in space, medicine, and resources. Last couple of chapters dealt with mainly of the consequences of this new technology and its social implications. Loved it all the way through and an exellent book for both beginners of the subject or someone that just likes to read about an interesting proposal for the future."
1,too bad it's all balderdash,"It's been twenty years. Over 50 million bucks have been spent on Nanotechnology, and not a single useful thing has come of it.Drexler writes really gee-whizzy stuff, but he's basically selling snake oil. Anybody with the basic clue about the law of scale can see most of the nanotech concepts are basically impossible. Meachnical devices can't be scaled down much below the millimeter level-- the basic laws of scale, friction, surface tension, charge, and materials disallows it. So Nanotech guys make microscopic ""gears"", but no shafts. Shafts, but no gears. ""Motors"" that can't turn anything. A 5x5 atomic checkerboard, a factor of 100 billion too small to be useful. And so on, and so forth.It's a clever book, but basically intellectually dishonest. Drexler went on to raise $20 million in venture capital and blew it all. That should give one pause when compared to the ""limitless horizons"" extolled in this book."
1,"There ought to be a ""legal"" limit to fantasy!","I have read ""Engines of Creation"". From my knowledge of the design and function of the human body (right down to the sub-nano levels), I have to say that Drexler is ""out of his mind"" on a lot of things he has written in that book. There ought to be a ""legal"" limit to fantasy !"
5,The seminal book,This (To my knowledge)is the first book on the subject and written by the person who created the term.Still worth reading after two decades.
5,A Satisfying Ending,"The mythic quest - in space this time. Following the clues written by Keltia's greatest Bard, Aeron goes off to gain the tools and knowledge needed to reclaim the Keltic throneworld - and gains allies and an empire in the process."
2,Nothing new!,"This book is incredibly tedious to read. I don't agree with previous reviewers that its worth the slog. There was nothing new or innovative in the concepts extolled in the book - this is just another methodology to get you from A to B (or maybe A to C if you adopt the Solution After Next principle). Like all methodologies, you can very quickly lose sight of where you're going because there's so much involved in working your way through the 7 principles. Also, didn't anyone else find the idea of the System Matrix overkill? I mean you could spend months working on a System Matrix before you got to move onto the next stage - an onerous task in the extreme. If you want to read this book, go ahead - it won't do you any harm. You may feel as excited about it as previous reviewers here. I guess all I'm saying is that its not for everybody."
3,Silly movie is worth a look.,"Although no classic Dinosaur Valley Girls contains enough silliness to make it a watchable Saturday afternoon time waster. Writer/director Donald Glut makes darn certain that the viewer knows that this is a joke (he all but pummels us over the head with it) and that makes up for the really bad special effects (considering that this was made for a measly ...though I think that it is understandable). The cast is obviously having fun goofing off in front of the camera and it's contagious. The music video intermission (a song called Jurassic Punk, hehehehe) alone is worth the price of admission."
5,Beautiful Tree,"This is a beautiful tree at a great price. Its our first large artificial tree and looks great in our living room all decorated for the holidays. Its easy to put up and comes with some nice extras (stand, extension cord, light tester and extra lights). I would recommend it."
5,awesome,just got turned on to these guys at a festival in SF last summer.. great guitar music rock/jazz.. good variety on cd easy to listen too over and over.. also great as background music at a party or i listen to it in my shop... enjoy
4,Inspired on Nicene Orthodoxy,"Andrew Louth writes well and nicely contextualises both the underlying platonic influences of Christianity, but also the transformative nature of the Christian tradition's use of platonism & pays particular attention to the Eastern/mystical lens of Christian praxis and its rational framework. I felt he treated both Plotinus & Origen fairly & recognises their ongoing influence. I didn't read this book word for word, but it is an easy read and a good reference work that is nicely referenced. Great chapters on Plotinus, Origen & Nicene Orthodoxy in particular. His work on the discussion of creatio ex nihilo in Nicene Orthodoxy was inspired & he takes an excellent perspective in the debate between Athanasius & Arius."
4,Pompeii Book is Enlightening,"I visited Pompeii in 2006 and it was an amazing experience. At the time, I was reluctant to buy any of the books they had on-site and add extra weight to my travel bags, but was hoping to find this particular book when I got home--and was very happy to find it. Seeing Pompeii restored thru the ""magic"" of the overlay illustrations really brings the history of this wonderful old city to life. No matter how good your guide might be in Pompeii, it is hard to imagine the splendor of the city when faced with the incomplete excavated remains. I would highly recommend it to anyone before or after seeing Pompeii in real life. It would also make a great addition to the classroom in teaching about the ancient Mediterranean peoples."
3,Tolerable,"This is the tolerable start of a very lengthy fantasy series. I began reading the series back in '99, after I had been thoroughly entertained by Duncan's ""The Reaver Road"" when it had been favorably mentioned by someone I respect. The book has verious elements of interest, but takes its time (and ours) in elaborating on its very drawn out plot strands. Of most interest to me was the male protagonist's brief captivity, which was quite intense. The female parallel protagonist I did not find to be quite so interesting. This series is notably lacking in the humor that was present throughout ""The Reaver Road,"" and despite the sheer number of pages devoted to their characterization, I found that the protagonists generally lacked any noteworthy trait for a fantasy series, save for Rap's nascent prestidigitation skills. This whole scenario was done far better (several times) by David Eddings, without the ponderousness."
5,Due for a reprint!!,This is a classic series that has stood the test of time and I would like to be able to buy this series for friends without having to purchase from ten different used book dealers. Omnibus editions would be awesome.
5,A Holiday Hit,"This is a fabulous CD. It puts you right in the holiday mood. I think the selection of songs is far better than his other Christmas CD's. Needless to say, his voice is superb. This is a must have!"
3,Jesus,"Indeed, I found this book very touching, but I had a hard time fitting into the style that the author was writing in, which he depicts Jesus almost as if he is the 13th, invisible Apostle. This is the first book I read from this author and I found the book taking a cautious, conservative standpoint in describing Jesus's life, from the point when he was first born, until his baptism, and up to the cruxifiction. This novel was written like a biography of Jesus in a novel form. The book can be a spiritual inspiration for some Christians and at the same time it was very entertaining. One can learn many things about Jesus that a person would never known before, the fact that he was ticklelish and that he felt a deep emotional pain when he learned of the execution of John the Baptist. Besides the author's struggling style, which can be frustrating if you expect this to a story telling novel, instead of another version of the Bible. Besides that, this book, in all respects, is a solid book!"
5,I LOVE IT !...,"I know those words are rarely used for describing a workout but it definetely needs to be said. I have been using this DVD for a little more than a month (first as a rental then bought from Amazon.com) and already I can see some results in the way my jeans fit. I actually went out today and bought myself a smaller size and they looked great. Anyway, this DVD is perfect because unlike other ab workouts this one those not hurt your back and the fact that all workouts are done in small time intervals makes it seem like your not doing any work at all. It actually helps push you to levels you thought you couldnt reach. Also the other workouts (Bodies in Motion) are great to help burn some fat. The arm workout it also helpful for definition. No more excuses ladies, this is the one to get."
3,Better for Beginners,"This DVD may be great for beginners, but I find these exercises to be too easy. I consider myself to be somewhat of an intermediate exerciser. I'm by no means in tip top shape and I was hoping this workout would be a nice challenge but after a few weeks of doing this dvd I never really saw any results. The exercises may be a challenge for a beginner but more experienced exercisers will be bored with this."
4,"Good, focused workouts","This DVD is very effective for working out specific areas, namely the abs and arms. The time flies by quickly and I would say the level of the workouts is moderate. I like the fact that it has an 8 minute stretch section, but I only use it every once in a while. I agree with another reviewer that the other sections are useless filler. I do the abs every day, and the arms every other day in rotation with another workout DVD I have. I DO NOT like the music but once I start the exercises I hardly notice it. Also, sometimes when you are doing the exercises you will notice that the people in the DVD are not in sync and that can put you off a bit. However, you will definitely see results with this DVD, and I recommend it whole-heartedly."
2,No silence between the notes.,"It is the silence between the notes, as well as the notes, that make music. This CD has continous droning sounds which vary in frequency for music. I enjoy meditative music several times a week. I listened to this CD several times over several weeks and did not like it once. This is mostly an annoying sound. With the rave reviews some have given this CD, I suggest you listen to it on-line if you can, before spending [item price]"
1,"another ""don't like it"" review","My curiousity got the best of me this time. I can't sit through this CD. I think you need to be into crystals in order to believe this is helpful.My advice to you is to listen to those samples, over and over, before you buy this.There is such an excellent variety of chant and sacred music out there, and I guess I'll have to stick with that."
1,A worst-of,"It's hard to explain, but this is a real worst-of in this series. Owners of the R. Crumb ""Coffee Table Art Book"" will find almost no new comix here, and everyone else save for the die-hard Crumb addicts will be brutally let down: the cartoon selections are poor and the majority of the book is comprised of illustrations for everything from jazz records -- admittedly quite nice, but -- to useless filler like covers from alternative newspapers. Total reading time: fifteen minutes. Buy this only if you suffer from the mania that compels you to complete a set, or similar."
5,This book resonates with an inner depth. Beautiful.,"This book is beautifully made, an artpiece in itself. There is a complete blending of spirit with the artistic nature within the visual outer world. Anyone who enjoys the look and feel of books will go wild over this one.It's an artpiece. 5 stars!!"
4,glad I got it,"I could not believe it, It helped with the first quiz. thanks for your assistance. keep up the good work."
4,competent christian counseling,very helpful in the time of need when counselling people. knowledge and wisdom that no counsel should be without. offers direction biblically and great for pastors and lay counselors
5,The author made me feel better about myself,This book is extrememly helpful in helping a nursing mother better understand her nutritional needs and the baby's. I felt terrible that I hadn't shed pounds by breastfeeding and yet I have friends that were at their pre-pregnancy weight in 6 weeks. My baby is doing great and I am on my way to my pre-pregnancy size in a way that is safe for my baby and healthy for both of us.
1,Buy the updated version!,"Please note how old this edition is (1992!) and choose the updated editionEat Well, Lose Weight, While Breastfeeding: The Complete Nutrition Book for Nursing Mothers. We've learned a lot about diet, nutrients, and bfing in the last 14+ years!"
4,Good Book,The book took a while to get to me...over 3 weeks but it came in good condition. Not too shabby for a used book at a great price...Would order from this seller again.
4,One of the FEW books available to nursing moms on weightloss,"Having been on a ""plan"" in the past (before pregnancy and after), I found the book to be very sensible and nutritionally sound. It is very difficult even to find books on this subject, which don't seme like fads....this one seems both do-able and healthy...."
3,It's OKay,"It works well for what it's designed for. I like that you can be listening to an MP3 and then take a call. The fact the earbud wires are different lengths is annoying as all hell. I used this for a while and gave it to a teenage girl, and one of the plastic earbud covers came off. She's not exactly a gorilla, but she's a little rougher on stuff than I am, probably because she's young and still has a life and goes places and does things.So, if you're not an old fart and still have a life, these may come apart on you. I doubt they'd last long if say; you're a gorilla and work in a factory or drive a tractor or something along those lines."
5,This is one of the best,"In this tape ash caught all three pokemon that he was able to choose from profsser oak Charmander Squirtile ,and Bulbsaur."
1,60 Minutes Did NOT Do Its Research,"It's clear that 60 Minutes did not speak to the neighbors of the Mama Foundation. The Mama Foundation operates with a complete disregard for the quality of life and health of its neighbors. Housed in a brownstone on a residential block, the Mama Foundation is so noisy that the police have been called several times. The Mama Foundation has also been warned by the Department of Environmental Protection, but it continues to behave with a callous indifference to its neighbors. Youths loiter on neighboring homes, and noise on Friday night, Saturday afternoons and even sometimes Sunday is horrible. The only thing that is important to the Mama Foundation is to exploit naive young people and abuse neighbors in its tawdry clutch at second-hand fame for its founder, Vy Higginsen. Next time, 60 Minutes, do your research!"
2,A most timely achievement.,"Nehamas' book is, in its elegance and fluidity, an exemplary misrepresentation of Nietzsche's principal concerns and ultimate positions. It is an exceptionally digestible manifestation of what Nietzsche characterizes as ""intellectual uncleanliness,"" and is thus a book of evidentiary value for diagnosticians of the ""postmodernist"" Zeitgeist which continues to foster a peculiarly resonant form of intellectual obscurantism as well as much mischief in the intercourse of actual ideas.For a work of standard-bearing excellence in Nietzsche scholarship, read Maudemarie Clark's ""Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy."""
4,Classic Magic,"Definitely recommend this DVD for those who love stage magic. Lance Burton is a master of classic sleight of hand as well as the large stage effect. There are several complete Las Vegas shows on this DVD and for those who can't make it to the Monte Carlo to see the performances, this DVD is a perfect substitute.As an extra bonus, Lance performs the sleight of hand routine that won him the Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Magiques (International Federation of Magic Societies) Grand Prix Award.Definitely add this one to your collection."

1,Rife with innaccuracies,"Great American literary giant, Washington Irving is rolling over in his grave because of this celluloid (actually video) travesty. Summerfield & Arth take numerous liberties with the Irving template setting the story in modern times, and moving the location from the dreadfully modern Sleepy Hollow High School to some dreadful prefabricated Maryland Suburb."
1,"Bad, Bad, and... oh yeh... BAD!","This movie was really BAD! ""Bad"" is the only adjective to describe it. WHO THE HELL WAS THE CASTING DIRECTOR? I""VE made better films than this piece of crud! STAY AWAY! The cast...BADThe story... BAD The Direction... umm was there any direction? ...or was it just anyone the cast found that could hold a camcorder and press RECORD. As I watched the movie I thought that it might make up for it's horrible plot by having some cool death scenes and gore. NOTHING! This movie had like.. NO BLOOD! The only Slasher movie that I have ever seen that had no gore and still scared the hell out of you.. was John Carpenter's Halloween! This movie was silly, chessy, and BAD!"
2,The first one was infinitely better,"After reading ""Love in Vein"", I was very pumped for the next set of stories but was very disappointed. Overall, there wasn't an interesting story in the bunch and some of them just went nowhere.The first book really delved into interesting storylines. Not every story was great, but it was fresh, erotic, with storylines that were interesting and focused on the vampire figure as a being."
5,Truly eliminate back pain!,"I have been using the techniques from this video for the past month. Although I was somewhat sceptical in the beginning, it really works. I especially like the ""scapular pinch"" exercise.In addition to helping my lower back pain the exercises make me feel more relaxed.I highly recommend this DVD."
5,A collection of lace fans,This book is an exquisitely photographed album of pictures and patterns of lace fans designed by Ann Collier. Many of the fans are in coloured lace and a whole range of techniques is used including needle and bobbin laces. Patterns are included for some of the fans but the book serves more as a breathtakingly beautiful album of Ms Collier's work. The patterns are also not for beginners and the instructions given require that you know what to do without a lot of detail.I can still recommend this one as you will enjoy looking at the wonderful fans and wondering how on earth the author found time to make so many let alone design them all!
1,Wrong version,"This was the wrong version. I'm not sure how the ISBN would match with a different book, but by the time I realized it, it was already too late to return it."
4,An intellectual journey into the realm of post 9-11 ideals,"Chadd Hatfield and Steve Payne's book is a a series of essays examining issues of personal degredation, rhetoric in the Clinton administration, and personal allusions in today's society to Athens and the French Revolution. The book is extraordinarily well written but there is the fact that some of the ideas seem somewhat scattered in what they cover. Nevertheless it is a highly recommended treatise that I anxiously await sequels too."
1,Stereo typed characters and extremely shallow.,This author has a vendetta against anyone who is conversative or Republican. It is so obvious that it is disturbing throughout the entire book. This guy needs to get over his hatred.
1,GACK,"This book was awful...narrative details that went nowhere, slowwwwwwwly developing plot, uninteresting characters. I can't believe this is the author's eight book. Maybe others were better, but this one stinks"
4,Where have I been?,"Im ashamed to admit that Stephen White is a new author to me. Well, since reading Cold Case I went to my local used book store and bought four other Stephen White books. His style of writing and his character reminds me alot of Jonathan Kellermans' Alex Cross character. I loved the book and I am very glad to add him to my list of favorite authors."
3,"touchy,feely","the narrator of this series,dr.alan gregory,a clinical psychologist,seems to have an inexhaustable supply of seriousness,sincerity and super-sensitivity. if kellerman's alex delaware is a 90's kind of guy,this shrink is a worthy, though overly caring, second fiddle."
2,Overly too long,"This book has too many pages that doesn't say anything at all. Each chapter has an introduction of how is the weather that is just boring. And at the end why the bad guys just confessed their felonies?When you know who was the bad guy and why you'll drop the book of this nonsense story. Definitely are much better books than this one because this one is not even a thriller, is a waste of time."
2,Misses The Mark,"An interesting beginning. A little action toward the end. The rest of the story is filled with mind numbing details. Do we really need to know how Satoshi eats her yogurt? Sometimes these little details add color to a story, but when they constitute a large portion of the tale, they slow the pace and are very annoying. There is a big mistake on page 81. White refers to crime scene tape setting up a second perimeter and denying access to the body. There is no body. The character is missing. I have enjoyed all of White's previous novels, but he misses the mark with this one."
3,Cold Case,"Right from the beginning I was pleasantly surprised to find that Stephen White didn't resort to using profanity to bolster his story as so many writers do. While I don't object to an author using profanity, it is extremely annoying to me, when every other word is a curse word. Too many authors seem to believe that the more cursing there is, the better the book. That is unfortunate, as too much profanity in a book is not un-like too much salt in the stew. A little adds to the pleasure, too much ruins it.That being said, I hate to admit that I can only give ""Cold Case"" a rating of three stars. I would like to give it more, but in my humble opinion, it wasn't gripping suspense. It wasn't one of those books that you can't put down. I am willing to give Mr. White another chance and will read more of his work."
3,Good Not Great Thriller...,"Clinical psychologist Alan Gregory and his wife Lauren Crowder are asked to join a select group of law enforcement officials whose specialty is Cold Cases or old unsolved murders. The murder they are called in on is one involving two young girls who vanished and were found dead months later. One of the girls family requests the groups help in solving the case.This book starts off great and then slows down considerably. I really like the main characters, Alan and Lauren. The rest of the group was interesting as well. I just wish the ending wasn't so predictable and had given these interesting people a more plausable way out!"
3,Chicken chips and tenderloins are better,"My dogs loved the beef and chicken rolls in the snack mix, but really didn't like the dried pig skin or whatever it was that seemed to make up the bulk of the snacks. There was a lot of flavoring and seasoning added that is really not needed for real meat products. My shar pei LOVE the chicken tenders and chip and the chips are just the right size for training."
4,An extremely refreshing and diverse mixture of sounds!,"I found this eclectic album tremendously enjoyable upon the first listening, and will be back to give a more detailed review once I've had the chance to explore it more deeply. What stands out most, besides the terrific dulcimer playing, is the extraordinary voice of Babs Parent, who performs on several of the tracks. Ms. Parent demonstrates a wide expressive vocal range, moving effortlessly across the tracks from innocent playfulness to sultry sophistication. In my book, she is the Julie London for the new Millennium. Congratulations to Andy Robinson and Babs Parent on this refreshingly diverse new album!"
2,Broke before I could plug it in!,"Super cute!!! But, it broke as soon as I took it out of the box. It was only $13 at Babies R Us so at least I didn't pay the outrageous price that they are selling Gossamer items for on here. Don't get ripped off!!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the play, I Hate Hamlet. The premise is more amsuing than the play turns out to be. I suppose witnessing a performance might be more interesting, but upon reading it, it is mildly amusing at best. Leaving aside the spiritual negatives of actually partaking in a seance and trying to communicate with the dead, the story rather bogs down with some sexual innuendo and some crude humor. There really isn't much of a storyline, and the supposed comedy is microscopic. A play that is somewhat similar, in that a film actor does a play, that I actually prefer and recommend isThe Fabulous Imbecilewritten by Michael Legge."
2,"Hardcore? (age: 19, I can't be bothered registering)",There's nothing hardcore about this apparent hxc release. I can see where the guy comparing Comeback Kid to Sum 41 is coming from. This band is just as weak and pathetic as the crap Sum 41 churns out. The singer sounds like a 13 year old trying to sound tough and there is even a certain similarity between the tone of his voice and that of the lame singer from Sum 41. Do not be misled - this is not hardcore. Maybe Sum 41 trying to do hardcore? Actually I reckon even those losers could pull off a better pseudo-hardcore album than this. It wouldn't be hard.
4,Vital music making,"This is an assured and vital recording. Murina's music making is compelling, rich and ultimately very inviting. Never a dull moment. Murina hits the ground running and it's a whirlwind ride. This is not to say it's all virtuoso and flash. Far from it. Great understanding and maturity is on display here. An excellent introduction for those looking for a place to start with Beethoven's piano music and a worthy addition for fans of these works and the piano in general. My mother bought me this cd shortly before she died. I count it as a blessing to be left with this cd as an expression of her recognition and support of my love of music."
1,Una mentira por Un gran Mentiroso,"El Senor Decker no sabe nada de la Iglesia de Jesu Christo. Si Usted quiere saber la verdad, llame los Elderes de la Iglesia y preguntales. Si quiere saber si El Libro de Mormon es verdad? Lea lo."
4,Automatic Hot Dog Grill Roller,"Works great! We enjoy using it for hot dogs and brats but it only does four brats at one time. Once you learn how to attach it to the grill and if you do not mind the clean-up, you will use it a lot."
4,Awesome,"The second volume of Ex Machina was really exciting. What was really refreshing was that it wasn't very predictable. The story itself was quite good, intertwining between a murder mystery, mysterious signs showing up in the subway relating to Mayor Hundred, and politics. The artwork also was very good. Just a really good follow up to the first volume, which was quite good itself."
5,Great. But.,"Very nice product, but for the price they should include the stabilizer bar you have to pay $20 extra for."
3,"Good, as far as it goes","This is a nifty little flash bracket, but with a couple flaws. It lacks a quick attachment device to secure the flash unit. I didn't want to have to screw the flash unit to the bracket so I bought separately a foot attachment similar to the one on my stroboframe. It works great and should be part of the Mini-Rc or optionally available. Also, the flash is in a fixed position, but this is the design for such a compact unit. You have to be careful, too, that the flash does not reflect back into the camera lens - especially if you use a diffuser or similar. For travel and quick use it is a nice product and well made."
2,Not Enough Fun,"Yes, there are hard rock versions of Abba tracks but it's a rather tepic effort. If you remake a song - just re-doing the song is pointless - if you decide to remake it using another genre, it has to fun or you have add something to it - other than just playing it with louder instruments - that'ds all this is. Karoake versions of Abba songs done with louder instruments - not terribly interesting nor fun."
3,"Hanson's ""Live at the Fillmore""","If you are looking for a video like Hanson's former ""Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere"" or ""Road to Albertane,"" you aren't going to find it here. This video is just a concert, no behind the scenes clips. However, any Hanson fan could tell you that these boys really have talent, so although this video is less-than-glamourous compared to Hanson's other videos, their abilities to wow an audience are ever-so-present in this concert."
5,Hanson,"Hanson's really great and althought I've always been a fan, I always rate there music as thought I've never heard them before. They always surprise me with there amazing energy and all. I'll proud to say there my favorite band and that I lasted throughout the Hanson depressed of 1999."
5,Hooked on Hanson,"It is so refreshing to see the raw talent of the Hanson Boys. They write their own songs and lyrics, they play their own instruments and they sing just great. Although I like Backstreet and N Sync, both are a lot of glitz and glammor. I bought the latest N Sync CD, Celebrity, and I did not like it at all. I just wish that Hanson would get the credit and the celebrity that they deserve. Keep up the good work guys!"
2,Not as offensive as the Spears garbage.....,"...but its still bad music. These 5 star reviews are too one-sided. This stuff does'nt even have enough weight to be called ""bubble-gum"" rock. Hanson is'nt terrible, they're just more popular than they have any right to be."
2,Pass on Dr. Muto,"At the store, this game seemed like it would be tons of fun. Well, I was correct for the first hour that I played. Muto gets very redundant with its huge levels and monotonous tasks. It almost seems as if you're making little progress in the game, as power-ups are few and acquired seldomly. Collecting the same items throughout the course of the whole game becomes boring and uninteresting."
1,Good if you don't listen closely,"There are tons of classical recordings out there; some definitive masterpieces, some novel and inspired, and some destined for the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. This last category is where we find this St. Petersburg Radio and TV Symphony Orchestra recording. To borrow the popular blue collar phrase, this recording was made with the ""get 'er done"" approach. Everything that could be spared was spared - including recording quality and musical talent. That's not to say it can't be enjoyed - I think I will be able to enjoy it as background music - but for those who enjoy listening closely to excellent work this will disappoint. Music like this nontheless serves a great purpose - giving access to those who can't or would rather not spend much over $5 on music they're not familiar with. This will definitely give you a good survey of what a Strauss waltz sounds like."
4,Comprehensive and helpful,"This volume is useful as you begin to market your work. It's a comprehensive guide to the steps an author should take, and its organization makes it a particularly clear and useful treatise that also is an easy ""go-back-and-check"" reference."
4,Good all-around binocs.,"Having had binoculars in the past be either way too expensive or too cheap, I wanted a new pair that would replace a pair that was loaned out, then lost. The opportunity presented itself in the form of a trip to Canada this past September, which required something that would be able to capture the Canadian Rocky vistas, but also not be so heavy that I would feel like needing a cart to stow them in. The Nikon Eagleview Binoculars seem to fill the bill (not too expensive, but also not too heavy). They have a great zoom feature that is easily changed as well as being able to easily focus with one hand. My only complaint is that while zooming in on a subject, the light level is reduced, which occurs naturally due to the nature of optics. You can't have everything, but these were just right, allowing my wife and I to use them time and time again while observing nature. In summary, a good pair for all-around use!"
2,does not hold focus while zooming,"These binoculars seemed like a great idea that was well designed, but upon opening the box today, I noticed there was a visible flaw in the objective lens, prompting its quick return to seller. It was brand new and should not, at ~$140, come with defects. The seller ([...[) was very quick at getting the unit returned at no cost to me. Very reasonable, no hassle.While on the phone setting up the return, I decided to dump this design. Reason: the Eagleview was unable to hold its focus while zooming, a fatal flaw in my book. Instead I reordered the Nikon Travelite V, 8-24/25, which was barely different in price. I have an old pair of the Travelite IIIs which still works great, and I am hoping the zoom engineering on the TL-V is better than on their Eagleviews.Might have given it three stars if it wasn't for the flaw in the lens, which colored my expectation of the overall quality of all others in this line."
1,The worst book ever!!!,"I have 3 words for this book, WHAT THE HELL! I didn't understand the story at all. This book was so horrible that I stopped reading it. Save your money!"
3,Works well in a car,"I have got mine back in 2006 for 250$, hooked it up to MviX and installed it in my car. It still works great, but only if you use VGA connection. If you plan on using the plain old AV connectors, then you will be disappointed with the video quality. VGA looks crisp enough for a budget monitor like this. It is not the best monitor out there, and is not suitable to be used in a Car GPS application, because of its poor performance in the sunlight."
4,One piece: collection 6,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view
4,Gardening All-in-one for Dummies,Fairly good book. Will answer questions for people new to gardening. It will also provide the experienced gardener with answers on the how to's. I would recommend the book to both newbies and experienced gardeners.
4,blame the seller for only 4 stars,"Sold to me as ""new"" and was actually ""used"" as it had a dirty plant marker in it as a book marker! lololol! This book is huge and full of info for gardeners in easy to understand format. Haven't read all of it. It has been a good resource for gardening questions."
5,A REAL Thriller for $0.25 ?,"How can so much fictional garbage sell for $20.00 or so, while a grippingly-well-narrated TRUE story like this goes for $0.25 used - itsa bargain !"
2,and i'm being gernerous,"If you're looking for a gun to use as a weapon in a game, then don't let this turn you away. I'll just say this: be extremely careful when assembling it. The instructions included aren't very clear, so you may have to do some guesswork. also, don't screw on the silencer too tightly, as I did. I ended up snapping off part of the barrel, and to glue it up had to fill the barrel with said glue. so needless to say, it doesn't fire anymore. if you're like me, however, and need this for a prop, (i'm shooting a movie and i thought this would work. thought wrong) then i'd suggest you hold out for a better model. This definately isn't the gun for a movie. all in all, worth less than the marked price by far."
5,Secure and comfortable,"This is the best seat! I bought two other seats that promised to ""fit all toilets,"" and both of them were very wobbly on both of our two different-sized toilets (both are more oval shaped). Anyway, this seat is adjustable and fits both toilets very securely. My daughter climbs up by herself and I'm not afraid of the seat moving around. If you've had problems getting a seat to fit your toilet, this is the seat for you. I also like its design. Very comfortable for her and good guard up front that stops any leaks but won't impale her when she sits down. A must buy. I'm trying to decide if I need to buy another. Tired of toting one upstairs and downstairs. Only drawback is its price. But, in this case, you get what you pay for."
3,Surprisingly average,"For our second son I decided to upgrade from the Mothercare potty seat that my first born son used (nothing wrong with it but it was 4 years old!) to this much pricier seat and was dissapointed that there was not much difference in its performance. The barrier hook in front actually bothered my little one and it prevented him/me to help him ""aim low"", perhaps because the seat is actually sloped inwards - I actually got splashed a lot more often with this seat than with the standard designs (we own two other potty seats/trainers).I was a bit surprised that this Baby Bjorn product did not meet my expectation as all their other products I have bought in the past were just top notch and have survived being passed on to others. Little girls would probably like this more as it fits quite snugly, but if you have boys, I would recommend just getting a less expensive (but equally if not more effective) piece."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I may be the one guy out there that does not like his books. What makes me mad is that I have heard so much good press I was excited about this book. There are a number of reviews here that sum up the story so I will not go down that road again. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book. I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book. Maybe I just have a mental block with him."
4,Very Gripping,"In the beginning it is a little confusing but once you get to the middle of the book then theres no way you will put it down. Its got all the necessary items for a successful novel i.e. suspense, romance. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!"
5,Best movie ever.,If any of you reading this have any doubts about this movie.....banish them. This is a delightful film that will make you laugh and cry.....and reflect. The script is great and the acting is superb. Have you ever seen a bad movie starring Christopher Walken??Enjoy.
4,Repentance,Nice to see a family bonding beyond this life. Duty to the family is important. Repentance of sin is positive.
2,Depends on why you chew gum,"I guess it depends on why you chew gum as to whether you will like Glee gum or not. I bought my first pack today because I had read an article about it recently. The texture is good and I don't have an issue with it sticking to any dental work but the flavor [tangerine] was gone in 5 minutes. I chew gum to freshen my breath and give me a low cal sweet treat. Glee gum just doesn't meet my needs. If they could make the flavor last longer, it would be great. Until then, this is probably the one and only box of Glee gum that I will buy."
3,Eh - it's okay.,"I was so excited when I found this gum today at a store, I had read about it and generally avoid gum because of all the crap in it. At first I was pretty impressed with the gum, I actually understood the ingredients and it tasted pretty fresh. Soon I noticed I couldn't move it around in my mouth because it kept getting stuck on my molars. Within about 5 minutes, with two pieces, the flavor was gone and my jaw was hurting from fighting to get it off of my teeth. Still, I would chew it when I am desperate for gum because the flavor is good at first and at least it isn't full of crap!"
2,Car auto tray,I'm a little disappointed I thought it would be largerbut its ok for my grandkids. I'm satisfied.Thanks
2,Small,It is a small tray. It is sturdy but small and the cupholder is tiny. Looks like it is designed for children accessories. Im giving it 2 stars not because it fails as a tray but because it isn't worth the price.
1,BEWARE!,"Doman's techniques may work to some extent, but his view on what constitutes ""knowledge"" is rubbish. Like many simpletons, Doman believes trivia is true knowledge. ""Bit of intelligence"" is his label for a piece of trivia, implying that the human being who has memorized the most trivia has accumulated the most intelligence. If you want your child to be a Jeopardy contestant, read this book immediately. If you want your child to be a thinker, don't waste your time and money. Albert Einstein, one of the greatest thinkers of all time, despised trivia. Do you want your child to be an Einstein or a Trabek?"
4,8 Minutes Before You Shower...,...Pop in the DVD and before you know it--It's over and you're happy that you did a little something for your health! Just what a busy I-Hate-To-Exercise person needs!
2,So not the late 80s/early 90s version I was hoping for,"This is an updated version of the original with new super buff and fashionable - ie no FUN! I wanted the original 8 minute abs and this is NOT it. Still good, I mean the exercises are fine, but not the originals."
2,Disappointed,The Abs and Arms dvd didn't work properly. Buns and Thighs was fine. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Good book,"Sarah Jane Price is searching for a way to stay in Nebraska. She, although only 14 years old, is forced to choose between making money or being sent to a Orphanage.I found this book to be slow in the beginning, but thought provoking and interesting as the story progressed. Jim Murphy has written some of the wonderful Dear America, etc. books, and he is no sloucher in this one."
3,Flawed but informative,"I'm a fan of the Dear America series of book yet found this to be one of the weaker ones. Firstly, there are some plot deficiencies - a 12-year-old girl passing herself off as 16 and being accepted as a teacher seems rather far-fetched to me [though for the time it was set in, this may not be so implausible after all]. The character of Sarah Jane Price seems rather flat and didn't engage me as much as some of the other protagonists in other books in the series.However, the story itself is one worth taking a look at for it covers an interesting time - a prairie town in 1881 Nebraska called Broken Bow with vivid descriptions of prairie life. Sarah Jane's determination to make it as a teacher and overcome adversities is worth admiring.There is a historical note at the end that elaborates on prairie life, as well as historical photographs of prairie settlers, schools, towns, even recipes and a poem. This book will appeal to history buffs."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"John Matthews is an important New Age writer on Celtic and Arthurian topics, and has written some valuable books on Celtic 'Shamanism'. Unfortunately, this book is essentially a reworking of Michael Harner's 'core shamnism', dressed up in some Celtic motifs. While that approach may be useful for beginning students, it shouldn't be mistaken for actual Celtic practice."
2,Trashy like flypaper!,"I read this in Jan. of 01 and am just now transcribing my notes. Here goes: Trashy, but I couldn't NOT finish it. Story of best friends who go to a summer house every August with their families. Secret betrayals of friendship, a hidden illness, a birth and a miscarriage. What else do you need to make a soap-opera style plot? I give Thayer credit for her spot on descriptions of feelings one experiences after miscarriage, from envy to despair. Bottom line: Rich people with too much money and rich people problems. It didn't stay in my short term memory very long."
3,Plot Revealed,"I agree with the reader who wrote that she had read the reviews before beginning the book........I usually use the reviews as a guide to whether or not I think I would enjoy the book. I never thought anyone would reveal ""major"" plot twists when writing an on-line review. So much for buying the book.......when the ending is already known. I am surprised that the review was allowed to be added to the website."
2,WAY too Jerry Springer,"Of course, if your idea of a good read is a soap opera between book covers, this may well appeal to you. I have read Ms. Thayer's more recent release, Custody, which I found somewhat more entertaining, but Between Husbands and Friends is not, in my opinion, up to her usual standards."
1,rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was at my cousins house when they recived a hover disk it looked so cool. my oldest cousin was the fist one to touch it and prabaly the last knowing how these things go so far on a windy day,and it was a windy day.my cousin therw it and we wached it fly miles away untill it disapred.What a rip off we all said.rip off piece of junk rip off piece of junk."
4,Lots of Fun!,"The hover disc is a great outdoor toy. We filled ours with helium - the metal ring gives it enough weight that it will not float away. However, it is not good on windy/breezy days as once it catches the wind, it will float on forever. Despite that, my 2 year old son thinks it is the best thing. He is happy for hours running around outside throwing it in the air. Despite being stuck in trees, and blowing over to the next block, the toy has held up better than I had expected. It lasted all summer with only 1 helium fill. And even better - it's refillable. I just purchased 2 more for gifts for friends who always want to play with ours!"
1,junk,"I bought this toy, against my better judgement, for my 8 year old son, and paid to have it inflated with helium. The commercial and the packaging said it was suitable for outdoor use. He and his siblings tried several of the manuvers shown on the commercial and played a game of their own. Within 20 minutes it had two holes in it and the frame was poking out through the mylar. This toy is a rip off and a piece of junk. I would NOT recommend this toy to anyone! Don't waste your money."
4,Inspiring Tarkan,"This is one of the best Tarkan's albums ever. It's the way in to discover a magic artist who has much better works than this, but alas it is the door to american people."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!,NOt what i expected. But it was cheap though. The only really good song from this CD is #4. That song is a 5 out of 5 and the rest are like a 3 and 2.
1,living a nightmare,"I was able somehow to install SystemWorks 2007, but the errors and issues would not stop and had to rollback to my previous 2006 version. I used this version 2007 and it offers nothing new to the 2006 version other than the same ussual UI change bundled with millions of new bugs.Only wish I had found a better alternative than Symantec, I would switch without hesitation.Please spare yourself from this installation nightmare and renew your currently working version. I spent a whole weekend just repairing the failed installation of 2007 and rolling back to 2006."
4,Inexpensive accessory and worth a try,"My cats are getting older and not as playful as they once were (although they still tackle each other frequently). Most of the time they ignore the ball part of the Turbo Scratcher, though they love the corrugated cardboard. However, I have heard them play with it late at night on occasion. It's certainly worth the few dollars it cost me for the replacement ball. If nothing else, I like to kick it into a spin once in a while when I walk by."
2,Shotty craftsmanship,"I received this item a few days ago and I noticed a rattling sound. At first I thought that it was normal but then I noticed that the rattling sound was a piece of loose solder. The ball doesn't seem to work reliably and I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the piece of solder that fell off. It took a bit of work but I managed to remove the small piece through a tiny hole (the one used as a holder for the small piece of paper preventing battery contact until it's ready for use).Seemed kind of expensive, five dollars, for a light up ball and with the added shotty craftsmanship, on the soldering, I really can't recommend this product."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"Bill McKeever's book contains some interesting questions, but if you happen to talk with a knowledgable Mormon about these issues, you may end up looking rather ignorant. He puts forth questions, but assumes there is no answers."
4,Simple questions and answers to help Mormons,This book is a very simplistic guide to help Mormons realize the downfalls of Joseph Smith. It gives nice examples of how the Book of Mormon was nothing more than his attempt to claim prestige. I only gave it four stars because it's hard to hurt a friends feelings. Mormons are trying to be wonderful people but are simply being told only the half-truths of their leaders and the cults history. The truth must be told and I recommend this once someone is willing to stand by their side to recover from the Mormon mental trap.
3,"Good information, but inconsistent behaviors confuse users","Being a beginner to the world of database driven web applications I found this book somewhat useful. My only major beef with the book is that in my experience using the tutorials and exercises and trying to apply them to ASP.NET, the screens and server behaviors didn't match up correctly leaving me scratching my head and randomly searching Dreamweaver's pull-down menus for the correct item to match my current tutorial step? Now I'm not sure if this book was just too early for the .NET world and I am trying to apply the latest and greatest technology to a inappropriate book or if the marketing for this book was just too ambitious? Overall a decent book, but don't bank on this being your ""bible"" if you are working in ASP.NET."
2,Boys' Own Stuff,"The Railway Detective is a not very well written, 'Boy's own' kind of yarn. It containes predictable, old fashioned dialogue and has a far-fetched plot. I was surprised to learn that the author is a writer of long experience and rather expected to find him to be someone who had had a first-attempt accepted for publication. The book contains an extremely high and unacceptable number of glaring mistakes (typos etc) and should be carefully re proof-read (and re-written?) before being re-printed."
3,colorful and evocative,"The first Train Robbery in Britain carried out with speed and military precision. Inspector Colbeck is called in to solve the crime with Victorian tools. Manners and early detecting styles kept me interested. Although it is, strictly speaking, a police procedural, the picture painted of life in Victorian England is real and colorful and remind us of how our lives and communications have changed in the past 100 years. Oh yes,there is a love interest too."
1,Waste of Money,"I opened one box, to open ANOTHER box, then the product. What a waste of money. I was wondering what I would be able to fit on the largest pan.....maybe a chicken, nope too heavy...maybe a chicken leg...nope too small. If you live by yourself these may work for you, but I have a family of 7."
2,poor quality,I have had these pans for about two years and the seal coating on them came off after about 2 months and they are always rusty. They still work decent but you just have to use tin foil when using them.
3,nice starter set,nice starter set for my daughter and her new apartment. she was very happy to have it as a new addition
2,Rust Very Easily,I moved into a new place with my girlfriend almost a year ago. About a 1/4 of the pans have already rusted out and those are the only ones that I have used so far. Unsatisfied with this product. I wanted a value buy and got what I payed for I guess.
3,they're ok,"i mean, they're typical bakeware. nothing special but it was nice to have been able to replace the old ones i had"
5,An informative and interesting look at a cultural icon.,This is an indepth look into the life and times of a woman who was immensely talented. It is written by an author who obviously takes great pride in her subject and is quite thourough in her presentation of her subject. It would be a fascinating A&E special.
2,TOO BIG for my shaved little head,"I tried washing it in cold water and drying it hot but it's STILL too big and even elastic @ that, for my little head. I DO shave my head so if you have ANY hair, this might be a good fit. I AM afraid that washing it warm/hot even 1x would be the end of it for adult use, though! For the money, give it a try. You can't please everyone...this is just me."
5,The Enchanted Conquest,"This is an excellent book. It can captivate even the adults! Danielle does an excellent job of describing things to where you can almost see them. I would recomend this book for any readers, young and old! I can't wait for her next book!"
1,They don't mention it's all LIVE and only ten songs?? What a waste!,"There are so many things wrong with this cd I can't even pick one. To start, it's all live, and it sounds as if someone recorded these at the actual concert..from 20 rows back, on their old tape recorder with the built in mic!Also, ten songs? Really? Who puts out a cd of GREATEST HITS and only puts TEN of them on it? Not even the top ten! It's like..someone said, let's pull 10 songs out of a hat and toss it on a cd...live songs only...and guess how many will buy it! Don't waste your money."
2,WEAK!,"One of my favorite works is almost put to boredom with this extremely weak recording. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a much better rendition. Something like the London Symphony, or better yet, find the Los Angeles Philharmonic conducted by Leopold Stokowski recording. Be prepared to turn your volume way-up for this one. You really do get what you pay for."
3,Gaslighting does exist,I was not quite sure of the situation that I am now facing. After reading the book I realize Gaslighting does exist. I now understand the sick minds that allow this book to guide them in the act of revenge. This book clarified to family and friends that gaslighting does exist and added validity to my statements. It has also moved me to inform and help others to the realization of the existance of gaslighting. My rating is a 3 star because the book is designed to help the criminal and not the victim.
4,Excellent book with great ideas and suggestions,"I found the book quite insightful, but I would like to get in contact with the author. Who should I write to? I have tried some of the authors suggestions, but my ex-lover only replies ""I love you and miss you, but it is over and we can't be together even again."" What should I do it was a ten year relationship. Any suggestions?"
1,I did not care about stories,If you are looking for techniques to use to get your lover back this is a horrible book to learn from. It is my opinion that there are only about five pages worth mentioning in this book. The rest of it seems to be filler pages and stories about other couples.
2,After 2 months- Getting loose,"after 2 months of almost daily use, the parts are loose and the crusher does not come down straight anymore. also if you have a orange that is thick skinned, this will not work as well as a machine which you can spin a orange on. this only crushes, so you need very thin oranges, like tangerines.i would rather get a $15 juicer from walmart i think. it will work with every kind of orange"
5,Metrokane juicer,"This product works as advertised, it is easy to use and easy to clean. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fresh juice, and who doesn't."
3,Metrokane Review,"I purchased this product specifically for grapefruit juicing. It would work more efficiently with oranges. It works fairly well with smaller size grapefruit, but the large grapefruit do not fit well.Metrokane Citrus Power Professional Juicer"
4,Good General Guide to consulting,"Dr. James does a good job of writing a generic ""How to be an Independent Consultant"" book. The book assumes you already have the required skills to be a consultant. I found the outline to be structured and the content to be concise with very good examples and illustrations. Very helpful."
1,Doesn't vacuum,"Worthless. Seals, but doesn't vacuum. Probably defective, but how many are?Costs more to ship back for warranty service, if any. They probably bank on that. Bought it to throw it away."
2,Not Happy,"I should've read these reviews prior to purchase. I bought this from Target beginning of Oct 2009 and have had 2 sessions of vacuum packing...no more than 10 packages. It worked fine until yesterday. It no longer seals properly. Seal is irregular, therefore does not hold a vacuum. Called customer service. They are willing to replace my unit, but I had to send it back on my dime. It cost me $17 priority mail. I did not bother calling Target as I have had this for ~ 2 months now. I wish I did. I actually wish I purchased from Amazon instead. I think they would've taken it back postpaid. If it fails again, I will demand that they pay for the shipping."
1,Did no work,We purchased this food saver brand vaccum sealing system and returned it immediately! We are buying the Rival and hoping for better results.
1,How can you try to ruin this?,"I wonder why it is that now a book series and movies come out that truly engage children and make them want to read and experience something that opens the imagination, people want to ruin it and take it away. I would sugest instead of banning Harry Potter merchandise we ban garbage like this. I pity you for being so cruel to a child's mind when all they are doing is reading finally.... instead of watching all the smut on TV. You should be singing praises for these books and their author. Three cheers for J.K. Rowling, for bringing good books back to our youth."
1,some guys are nut jobs,"people who think harry potter (or other stuff that is similar) are a little off their rocker. i mean, come on people, we need to have stuff like harry potter to fuel our imaginations and increase creativity. and, for cryin' out loud, everyone should be entitled to watch these kinds of movies. it just ain't right not lettin' kids whatch fantasy movies. it's like forcing them to not have fun. it robs kids of their childhood."
3,Don't overtighten wall mount.,"Speakers work fine. The place where you screw on the the wall mount bracket is weak. If you tighten it too much, it breaks and spins freely. Then you can't get the screw out at all."
1,cheap! already broken!,"I read the comments for these speakers before I bought them. I should have listened to them! Not 2 weeks after we started using them, the sound went out. We could barely get any volume on them. We had been running them at a constant volume, so there was no ""loud"" music coming through them. The volume remained the same for the few times we used them. You get what you pay for. I am not rating the seller, just the product. The seller was excellent to work with."
1,Exceptionally bad.,"As another reader notes, this takes a rather tumultuous time and place in NYC -- the Lower East side circa 1985 -- and makes it boring. If you're at all interested in the topic, you should try to get a hold of the long out-of-print anthology, ""Between C&D: New Writing from the Lower East Side"" or ""Love is Strange,"" both edited by Joel Rose and Catherine Texier. This was a cutting edge magazine, printed on a dot-matrix and distributed in a poly-bag, it published the early works of David Foster Wallace, Tama Jamowitz, Gary Indiana, Patrick McGrath, the late Kathy Acker, Dennis Cooper, Lynne Tillman, Barry Gifford, William Vollman, and many many more. Nersesian can't hold a match to this stuff. There's simply nothing inventive or compelling about his [weak] tale. A waste of money and time."
4,Big City Run About,"I received this book as a gift, so if it was interesting enough to keep me reading for half the book I'd consider it a success. By that standard, this book was a true pleasure. It gave me that same feel as Buddha of Suburbia. A grimy look at life in the big city. When the main character is depresed, I felt sympathetic. The only part of the book that struck me as out of place was the ending. It wrapped up the story in perhaps a way too simplistic way."
3,A long time since I read this book,"It's been a long time since I read this book, but what I can remember, it's basically an attempt at a modernized version of Catcher in the Rye. It's a little depressing. The main character has the unfortunate traits of being both a screw up and of having bad luck. You might be able to relate if you've ever had a really hard or weird time in your life.The book was good; it kept me interested until the end (which is an accomplishment), but it wasn't great."
5,Temptations Updated Edition,"Very interesting reading. So sad how things turned out for this group. However, some of the things Otis Williams said must be questioned. It's amazing how everyone of the Tempts had problems except him. Looking at the history of the Tempts and the long list of different singers who have come and gone, why is that? Could it have something to do with Otis Williams? I wish one of the other Tempts had written about what it was like to be in that group. Maybe Dennis Edwards will. Or maybe some of the others. Otis cared more about keeping the Temptations a group rather than caring about the people who made up the group."
1,Have you ever watched paint dry? Same thing,"If tihs is not the dullest and worst movie I've ever seen, I can't remember which other might be. Pretensious, slow, speculative, and not worth any cost."
5,Plasma physicists do it with confinement,"I took an intro to plasma physics class using this book at the undergraduate level - and this book was perfect. It has a good blend of experimental evidence, theory, and math. The derivations are really good, you can follow along in the margins. The pictures are clear and beautiful, the page layout easy on the eyes. This is not a graduate text, but aimed at the advanced undergrad level. You should already know calculus, complex analysis, EM, and linear algebra before learning this material."
5,Just a cup of water in desert,"As a prospective law students and a asian student, I've especially interested in American history. In addition, this totalitarian jingoism has made me very critical about US democracy. Do you think Sep 11th is a disaster? Then US attack to Afghan is a catastrophy!This book is a few exception that US scholars think in their own independent way, not for the benefit of corporate.It makes you think over 'What is real justice?'. Also, it is wholly readable."
5,The truth can hurt and free you..,It feels good to have a light shining into dark recesses when in this culture obusification is all that is generally offered.The light is so bright it sometimes hurts but one's footing is much safer when all is allowed to be seen.
1,Zinns Of Our Country,"Howard Zinn was (he passed away a year or two ago) nothing if not consistent - consistently myopic in his one-sided, anti-American, socialist views and failure to state other sides of issues. To read his books - they are all the same - one would think this country could do no right (unless of course you he was writing of an historical figure from the left side of the political spectrum).America is far from sin free, but it has also been the most fair major power, with the possible exception of England, in history. Zinn casts America's sins as if we alone sinned. The fact is that our mal and misfeasance was small-time compared to other nations, and we worked to correct our wrongs, while what what we've done right is unequaled.The real sin is that Zinn's books are used extensively as a text books, proving once again that much of our educational system is controlled by the left or fools."
5,US History Not-Lite,"I often use this book in one of my university history classes, ""US History Since 1877."" It's biased. All history writing it biased. (George W. Bush's problems with ""revisonist history"" aside.) I tell the students about Howard Zinn and his biases. And I tell them to try and be as upfront and aware of biases as they are of Zinn's, and as Zinn is of his own. People are bombarded with so much yahoo, rah-rah, raise-the-flag, my-coumntry-right-or-wrong (the next part of that toast is usually---and very conveniently---ignored; check it out some time) that Zinn is as refreshing as a tequila mojito on a hot summer day. He may rant, but unlike many on the other sides he can be checked out for veracity and found to be correct. You have to be when you're taking shots from folks who prefer using cant, rhetoric and arrant nonsense to propel their own agendas. Highly recommended. But, if you use this book in a class, watch out; the Thought Police are watching."
1,"tempo too fast, violins squeaky-sounds off-key, segways are not fluid","I received this as a gift after losing my John Holloway - Piero Toso - Jean-Claude Malgoire - Claudio Scimone version. My mother read the reviews for this and all were positive. I was a bit surprised that this is a #1 bestseller after opening and listening to it. I had to turn it off as the tempo was slightly too fast, the violins squealy when they should sound delicate and sprightly in ""Spring"" and in parts it sounds off key. I cannot return it as it is open, but ended up ordering my original version after finding the empty CD case in the basement. I gave it one star, because while I enjoy listening to classical music on a daily basis and it is like nails on a chalkboard for me, I see that others think this is a nice version. Maybe you will too, but I recommend listening to a sample portion of it on-line prior to purchasing. A safe option with really lovely sound is the version above which also gets 4 or 5 stars on Amazon."
5,This CD sold me on violin music!,I am not a connoisseur of classical music by any means. I just needed something to drown out the other noise in the office and a coworker lent me this CD. I am definitely buying it; the music is beautiful! Very upbeat and perfect for helping me focus on my work.
3,Not quite a perfect fit for Vivitar VPT-120,"This part Looked identical, but did not fit correctly even though other websites list the QRPER as a Vivitar VPT-120 replacement part.A close comparison shows that two of the small feet on the bottom were squared off where the original part was triangular.It can be ""made to fit"" with a Dremel tool and a few minutes work; however, if you have lost the original part, then forget about buying this as a replacement. Close only counts in horse shoes. ;-)"
3,Poekmon carry case review,"I think that it's a very safe place to keep your games. It has a good amount of space for some games but as your collection grows you'l need 2,Overall I think it's great."
2,It didn't add much....,"As a long-time fan of this genre, I expected more from this book. However, it was too academic, spent too long on only a few authors and didn't add anything to my understanding. The author spent quite a bit of time reviewing plot details and I admit that I enjoyed her analysis of Nora Roberts and Jayne Krentz books that I had read, but there was too much detail and repetition.There must be better books out there....and I'd love to read any suggestions."
1,RUBBISH!,"Yet another Romanov book that assumes its readers are brainless. The author makes numerous mistakes about basic historical facts..one example being his claim that Grand Duchess Elizabeth (""Ella"") is buried in China, when she is actually buried in Jerusalem. In another chapter he claims that Anna Andersen and Anastasia were the same person, when it had already been proven (with DNA testing) that they were NOT the same. Based on interviews with the Filatov family, the authors would have us believe that Alexei escaped, but little evidence is given to prove this.I don't know how this book could have been published before DNA testing has been done. Save your money...don't buy this one."
1,Absolutely ridiculous.,"Alexei Romanov was a hemophiliac in poor health in 1918. There is no way he could have survived the massacre, much less live as long as this man did and endure the physical hardships that he did. The resemblances are superficial at best. This book is not worth your money."
2,"Nice, but not a match","It all boils down to this: there is no way that the little boy and the man in the front cover (or in any of the other pictures) are the same person. Alexei's eyebrows tend to be very square, yet Vasily's are drooping down. Age may change appearance, but there is the ""essence of the person"" and these two don't match. The rest of the story is interesting, especially the history, but the argument is not airtight or even water-tight. There are other explanations. As for the writing, the book tends to drag on at times, but overall it is entertaining reading."
3,A good read about a real mystery,"There is a genre of books about mysteries. Was Napoleon poisoned? Who was Jack the Ripper? And now, what happened to Alexei? I enjoyed the book. It was informative, thorough and carefully written. However, the translation loses something. This would've been better if the appendix included a timeline of the Revolution, explanations of the patronymic names, and a current map. I've read Russian texts before, and nearly all were better translated. That is the biggest impediment for the general reader. That being said, I learned a lot about the Revolution, and about the life of an average Russian, who may have actually been a Prince in hiding. I recommend this book, with the caveat that the translation is cumbersome."
1,pardon me but.....,"am i the only one who realizes that the young alexei is a very good looking chap with sharp striking good looks , and that vasily filatov is an ugly man. how can any person think that these two were the same afher looking at the pictures. it seems the authors are accidentaly telling you that they are not. do your self a favor and burn this book...."
5,"Danielle Steel, Vol: 3 Remembrance/Once in a Lifetime/A Perfect...",More Danielle Steel novels made into Lifetime Television Movies. Thank Goodness!Love her shows so very much! Wish the Universal HD would start showing them.
4,"soap opera sci-fic, but fun","Yeah this book isn't hard science fiction, but its a fun read if you're in the mood for it. A lot of the characters are pretty shallow, and its basically the equivalent of a kiddy fairy tale. But, unlike some writers of similar fiction (like for instance Piers Anthony), Gear doesn't try to pretend he is writing some deep novel, its just one rambucious, oath swearing, laser shooting, big-boobed chick, wild, story ride that is fun if you're feeling right for it. Don't expect to read another ""Childhood's End"", expect more kind of a mix between Beverly Hills 90210 and Bonanza."
2,Written with the subtlety of a sledgehammer,"This space opera is so over-the-top it hurts to read it. The protagonists and antagonists are way larger than life, yet they do some rather bone-headed things at times. The plot is so blatantly telegraphed that I the only reason I kept reading was to find out in what dazzling fashion the next event would happen. If you want good space opera, try ""The Dragon Never Sleeps"" by Glen Cook or ""The Snow Queen"" by Joan D. Vinge."
1,this is junk,it does not stay attached to the sink faucet and will not attach to anything larger. cheap plastic construction. hoses were kinked in transit.
4,Excellent Novel,"Like some other Banville novels (Dr. Copernicus, Kepler), this book is a combined psychological and historical novel. This novel is a fictionalization of the life of Anthony Blunt, the esteemed art historian revealed late in life to have been a spy for the Soviet Union. Like other members of his spy circle, Blunt was raised in the heart of the British establishment just as many of its key institutions were losing their power to compel loyalty. Banville writes extremely well and does a wonderful job of conveying the ambivalent motivations and ambiguous actions of Blunt and his cohorts. Banville's portrait of his protagonist is hardly sympathetic and might be described as clinical but is compelling and richly detailed."
4,Lots of exercises but little guidance,This book contains lots of great exercises but has very few indicators about how well you are doing in the exercises.
2,Complete Nothing,"When I opened this book and read it all the way through,I certainly didn't think it should be called Complete Drawing Course. It's very lacking in the use of how to see and examine what your drawing. It's very static. For the beginning artist who is learning to draw at home with no school art training,I would not recommend this book at all. Heck even Walter Foster books are better than this.One of the books I love is The Drawing Handbook by Frank J Lohan who takes you from the beginning in tools and composition and goes on to drawing everthing from buildings to animals."
5,LOVE this album,"I have been a fan of Luciano ever since my early teenage years (mid-90's) and this is up there with the albums I've enjoyed the most. This album has at least 3 songs in my top 10 favorite Luciano songs(Prophecy, Never Giving In, Cry for Justice) and several others that came in close.I think overall is a very good album. It's been on repeat on my ipod(first time ipod) now for weeks and I never get tired of it."
5,By far the best guide to Miami's social life and history,"Before arriving to Miami, I bought this guide. Once there, I tested it and it was 98% accurate. No matter what you are interested in, this guide has a suggestion for you. From dining and clubbing, to hints and tips, to small excursions outside the metro area. A must for everyone interested in visiting Miami."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Well let's just say it only lasted for 3 or 4 weeks. Brought this toy for my grand daughter who loved the toy, but the plastic kept coming off and the lid would not close. The handle came right off in her hand.Once you let it down, would never click back up. Poor kid told me it didn't work like my vacuum.You get what you pay for, but it could have been put together better. Had to go purchase another vaccum cleaner at another store because she kept asking for it."
5,This book is wonderful!,"This book really brings to life what living in Northern Canada was about in the early 1900's. I found myself thinking what it would be like in Elizabeth's shoes. She endured such hardships just to be with the man she loved. What a great lovestory! It is excellent, just like all of Jeanette Oke's other books that I have read. I can't wait until it is printed again so I can have my own copy."
1,This product contains fish oil,"The product contains fish oil, which isn't disclosed on the product page. Fishy smell along with fishy burps - yuck. Returned."
5,3-in-1 Carb Blocker,"The product is great! Small problem while it was being shipped, apparently the liquid-gels don't like to be frozen/very cold, some of them split and the contents escaped. But, I will order the again!"
2,Didn't work for me,I tried this brand and two other carb-blocker brands and none of them seemed to have an affect on me. Wish it worked.
5,A must have,No more feeling over stuffed when I indulge in pastas or pizza. I use these throughout the week and feel that they do work.
3,Bathroom Please!,"Product was promptly shipped and arrived as promised. I took it for about 10 days as directed. Did not notice any weight difference, but spent ALOT of time each morning in the bathroom. Multiple trips. Discontinued for this reason. I was looking for white bean extract to boost metabolism."
1,This product does not seem to work,"I have been taking the product every day for a week. 2 pills twice a day at meals. I have relatively low side effects, but I dont see any change in my weight. I eat sensibly too. nothing is coming off. Will not purchase again"
3,Not sure,Not really sure if this works or not but I know it did make my stomach upset after taking it and eating a meal with carbs.
4,Seems like it works,"I started using this after watching Dr.Oz Show and found out that White Kidney Beans can block carb absorption which is what I am looking for. Exercising is important but limiting carb is very tough for me.I pop 2 of these pills during my meal when I eat pasta, rice, or anything with starch. I've noticed that when you take these in conjunction with starches, it tends to cause me to feel bloated. I guess it maybe causing the starches to clump up instead of being absorbed.The bad part about this is that it does cause constipation as I normally hit the bathroom everyday in the afternoon and taking these made it difficult to exit stool. When I do exit stool, it feels heavy and thicker than normal, I guess this is the by product of having carbs clump up instead of being absorbed."
2,Not what I expected.....,"I opened the panel and it's almost a charcoal gray... I expected the color to match the black suede down comforter I bought, but as I said, the panel was gray, and it's obvious. The back of the curtain has almost a white sheet behind it that I wasn't too fond of, because I want the back to be seen nicely, too. Maybe I'm just picky. If you're looking for BLACK curtains, search for a different item."
4,"""Great, punching fun,"" Coopster Game Reviews LTD.","A realistic boxing game that has cleverly mimiced the 5 films which featured the great actor Sylvestor Stylone playing Rocky Balboa. If you're going to get a boxing game, get this. You'll be entertained until your PS2 overheats! There is just one problem, I can't believe that no one thought about making this game before now. I also think that there could be more to this game, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5. I'll leave those ideas for the producers to think about. In the mean time, enjoy your fighting!"
5,Awesome,"Incredible. Multiplayer supurb - true to Rocky form, this game is the best of its genre. BUY IT!"
2,If you MUST have a boxing game . . .,"The first thing you will notice about the game is how ridiculously disproportionate the characters look. Wow, in a world of Dead or Alive Extreme Volley Ball, couldn't UBI Soft do better that this? Okay, but you get to beat up on Apollo Creed and all the other antagonists from the Rocky movies, so maybe there is something here. Not so. I was bored in minutes. With so many excellent fighting games out, how can one endure repeating a few simple moves? (Punch, punch, jab . . . jab, punch, punch.) It's pretty bad. And when you get hit hard, little blue start appear above your head. Once I got hit with a jab the stomach, and the character flipped up and around, and landed facing down on the mat. It was more like a move in professional wrestling. But hey, if you really want a boxing game, you might like it."
5,"Puzzle Book, couldn't put it down!","Holes is just like a puzzle book. You learn more as you read. And you put the pieces together as you learn. When you fill the last hole, puff! The book is finished. I, personally coudn't put it down. One of the best books I've read."
1,Not worth the money,"I had bought this item on April 2011I didn't use it much as we had wireless internet connection and this was mainly used in conjunction with Vonage.I had bought this item after going through customer reviews.Therefore my expectations with it was that it will last at least 2 yrs or so.Though for 8 months it gave issues for 2-3 times , when I had to restart it yet It just stopped working in 1st week of DecemberNothing but it just DIEDIn my opinion if we spent decent money like 50+ bucks we don't expect the thing to last only for 8 MonthsTherefore please don't BUY This ITEM which last not even an YEAR."
1,Didn't work for us.,We had problems from the start with this device. Our other D-link products worked great but this one would never recognize any network that we hooked it to. Maybe it was a bad day at the manufacturer
1,Not what I expected...,One thing to point out. I bought this and didnt get all of the equipment. Maybe Im one of the few? Oh and its old like Windows XP old.
2,poor,"I spent hours with support staff, some rude, some helpfulturned out to be a faulty unithad similar unit in the past that worked fineWill not purchase a DLink product again"
3,Easy to use but does not perform well,OK Short and sweet.I have some other D-link branded products and really like them but this was really disappointing. For some reason this modem will not hold the connection speed with my DSL. I have had the line tested by AT&T; and they say it's fine. The modem will come up at full speed at then within a few hour drop down to a crawl. It then needs to be rebooted to get the connection back up. I have review all the IP traffic and it is nothing to do with my local network. I switched to similar product from Netgear and the problem went away.
1,DSL-2540B bad news,"First problem is that this router doesn't have wireless, but I guess that's my fault for not paying attention to the details. I bought it to replace the one I rent from Century Link DSL, and save the monthly rental charge. After spending about an hour trying to get it to connect to Century Link, I called tech support for help. They told me I needed a login/password from Century Link. I called CL and they said their is no login/password to connect to DSL. Next I tried to update the firmware from the D-Link web site. This rendered the router completely useless. Guess I need to call for warranty replacement but I know it won't work when I get it back, so I have dragged my feet. I will never buy another D-Link anything."
4,D-Link DSL Modem,"Purchased D-Link DSL Modem recently. This was my first time to purchase a modem outside of the AT&T system. It was an easy set-up and easy to understand. Any installation hiccups I had related to AT&T. I would recommend this modem to friends and family. I've only been using the modem for a couple of months now, so I can't really comment on longevity..."
4,2 for one; Everyone loves it but the Haitians,"The fact that everyone was up in arms about a ""kill the haitians"" line in this game shows how crazy america is. There is all kinds ofstuff in this game (games) that are offensive. I think this game is is over the top, and I love it. I do not like the fact that they made it super hard to kill people in the second game, the cops come too fast, and like they get all SWAT on you. It was better when you could just lose it, and like hide out and sniper people."
1,I have a life,"If you in any way have a life outside of video games, quite frankly, this game is not for you. As published this game has very open ended gameplay. For me, this was not enough to keep me in front of the Xbox. It really needed a little more. The graphics are horrible (very PS2) and the 1st person action just doesn't work. The best part of this game is the terrific story, but I just don't have a month or more to dedicate to this game."
4,"Great game, just too long in the coming.","What can I say about GTA that hasn't arealdy been said. The game is friggen great. I cannot think of a game that I more fun. The down side to this double pack is that it took forever to come out. I got so used to playing them on my PC that I couldn't get the hang of playing them on Xbox. I definitly recommend getting the game, whether it if for Xbox, PC, or PS2 is up to which controler, play style you like.Happy Gaming."
4,worth every penney,all I have to say is that it's awsome one of the best games I've every played go out and buy it right now
3,not for kids!!!,not for kids !it is rated M.there is things in that game that kids sould not see.it is a good game but not for kids that are smaller then 18
3,average - poor graphics \ excellent game,"Ive never played the playstation version, but I have played the PC version and I think the xbox graphics are terrible on this. It very blurry. I also think some aspects of the game where left out that the pc version has, for example I played them back to back and notice, there is alot more types of people on the streets, who also say different things, and act differently then the xbox version. The only thing good about the xbox is the controls, when it comes to firing the guns with the scopes, the pc version is impossible, and so is the stearing of the boats.....i guess you cant win, you either play the version with the beter graphics, and sucky controls, or play the terrible graphic with the great controls and custom sound track, take your pick, excluding the graphics, the game is awsome."
5,gta vice city,Its my childhood game I love it. get this when its available. Best franchise of games ever. Beats any other franchise that comes out every year. Can't wait for gta 5. Good shipper too.
4,You Really Don't Get It!,"It's very sad to see people like McD commenting on how violence corrupts the youth of today. Kids don't just play games like GTA and think, out of the blue, I'm gonna go shoot up my school. People have these thoughts in their heads already. Movies don't create psychos, movies make pyschos more creative. I'm 13 and I've played GTA before. Kids know that going around killing people and stealing cars isn't how real life works. People shouldn't censor their kids, we're gonna learn about this stuff anyways."
4,Washable bedpads remain soft,"This product deserves 4 stars. It washes and dries almost like new, doesn't pile, or get stiff. Large enough to cover a good part of the mattress. I would recommend this product for good protection."
5,Another incredible slice of life and love from CK,"Right Outta Nowhere continues the winning streak of 2002's Rain&Mud&Wild&Green with a new collection of stories that stay with you long after the CD ends. CK's voice continues to mature, speaking with a lovely combination of intimacy, nuance and emotion that pulls you in and leaves you reflective, replenished and refreshed. With top-notch (but wonderfully restrained) production and playing, and arrangements that stay out of the way of the songs, this is one of the top 10 albums produced so far in 2004!"
3,DS Lite screen protector,"""Does not fit properly onto lower screen. used for upper screen only. cannot apply it ""as is"" without getting a bubble. i guess it can be cut down a bit to serve its purpose better. i recommend especially for price"
1,Not as advertised,"Product arrived with packaging showing an iPhone, with just a little sticker saying ""For NDS"". Both protectors were too large to fit on the bottom screen, and one was significantly larger than the top screen. This leads me to suspect that the protectors are sized for a DSi, not a DS Lite as advertised. The packaging has a list of ""features"" such as ""Anti-Glare, Dust Repelling, Fingerprint free, and Bubble Free"", all of which are obviously false with a glance at the product. Also did not come with the bubble-removing card the instructions mention. You get what you pay for, apparently."
2,Hunter,"I'm not saying that this would not be good for some folk, but if you have a problem listening too closely to sounds, this machine will simply not do. It will not be long before you pick up on how short the actual sound clips are that you are listening to, and you will soon pick out when and how often they repeat. If you are actually trying to relax or sleep, this can get quite distracting. There are better machines with longer cycles -- look for those even if you have to pay more."
5,Perfect for Baby Whitenoise,"I was a little hesitant to purchase this product based upon the reviews, but it has been an absolute life saver for us. Our little one is 7 months now, and we still use this every night for her and it stays on pretty much 24/7. Good volume control, nice sounds, doesn't take up too much room and a good length cord. Highly recommend."
1,Great for about 3 weeks.,"I bought this to help my two year old transition from the noise of his summer fan into the winter with no fan. He loves the rain noise, and will now fall asleep to it... But about three weeks after we bought it, the on/off/volume control developed a bad spot on it. Now I cannot get the volume adjusted correctly without a lot of static.Maybe I just got a lemon, becuase I own several other HoMedics products, and haven't had a problem with then. I'll try another one of their sound machines, but I'll avoid this model."
5,Great Game!!![...],This game is unbelievable especially for Rocky fans. I loved it and don't stop playing Get it You'll love it!!![...]
4,Who Would Listen To That Twelve Year Old Idiot,"seriously who would listen to a twelve year old? These are the two best games ever. I mean seriously they are violent but not realistic, and parents, who cares?I have two kids(13, and 6) they both love GTA, and they are not bad kids , they do well in school, and they arent violent. This game has no impact on the way a kid acts."
3,Ehh,"I could've lived without it. The graphics aren't as great as San Andreas, and there's blurring and such at times. But, the missions are still fun and such, if you can get over the graphics/blurring aspects of it. The radio music is still good, and the overall game."
5,The author was very creative in making a world for teachers.,The author used alot of good and funny words when making this book
5,This halarious book sets up the truth about teachers!!!,"Apple Island is a funny book!!Everyone should have a chance to read it. The characters are really funny and our teacher had us guess what the mines were made of, etc. We ;oved this book!!!!!!!"
2,explaining rainbow to color blinds ... same frustration again,J krishnamurthy was honest and perhaps most spiritually advanced individual in 20th century. I however think that he just could not explain his theory ( or state-of-mind ? ) effectively. There are very few people who could understand what exactly JK is intending to convey. This book again is no exception. I know his followers tried to understand him for decades without really getting there. I am very literate and hard working reader ( I re-read his chapters ) . I can not say that I understand JK...shrikant
2,Superficially informative,"This is not the book to buy if you wnat to pass the 70-240 exam. Lots of information is missing or badly explained, some chapters are very superficial and incomplete.The exercises as well the text chapters just tell you what to do not rather why you do it that way.Get Syngress book it is much better book."
2,Nothing Special about it...,"I got this book last March 2001 and read it all, it lacks a lot of useful information needed for real life and/or Exam pass; the labs and exercises are available on the companion CD only. Also I found a lot of typo errors in some chapters and the securtiy part is so poor, and many information were repeated a lot in other chapters, which makes the book quite large and heavy.Most of the text in this book is available in Win2K online-help and the Resource Kit, and refering to the companion CD is a real pain if you're reading the book far away from the computer.The included sample questions/apply your knowledge part is far away from the real exam questions/scenarious.Waste of money, get Sybex or other books, at least they include the exercises or labs inside the book rather than on CD."
1,this product [is weak],... I bought this because it was a good price and was given a 5 star rating. It does not play and is falling a part. Don't buy this save yourself the hassle.
1,DVD Player is Junk,I purchased the RCA Model DRC600N DVD Player and sent it to my Marine son in Kuwait to watch movies. It played three movies and now locks up and skips constantly and is basically unusuable. $450 bucks down the drain. NO MORE SHOPPING ON LINE AT TARGET.
3,nice toy,"This toy keeps my two year old occupied more than my four year old. Although it does teach kids the basic words in spanish, like ""lago"" for lake and ""el camino"" for the word road, etc, so from that perspective it is educational, but it doesn't hold an older child's attention for very long (4 and up). I would recommened this for ages one to two years of age since repetition is what they enjoy. As for its durability, my son has thrown it around on numerous occasions as the toy is still working like new."
2,Educational but not fully functional,"My 2 and a half year old daughter (and now my 7 month old son) enjoy playing with this toy, however my daughter is a little disappointed that Boots does not say anything. I say this toy is not fully functional because the insect fiesta band in the bottom right corner looks like a button that should be pressable to make noises like Dora, Swiper, and the Map, however our button does not go down when we push it, nor does it make any noise. Was ours just the one defective toy, or are there more that have a button that does not work? One day my daughter cried for an hour because this button does not work."
3,RODO,"The appearance is okay, but the call could be a lot better. While it sounds vaguely pigeon-esque, some coo-ing sounds would have been better. Definitely not the best audio on this one."
3,not bad,"game was fun rather easy to beat,nice graphics ,seemed alittle slow at first but remember""getting strong now"".Game has a nice punch."
5,This one belongs in my personal library,"I like the manner Mr Smorenburg approached this complicated subject of business acquisition - simple, clear and complete. It is one of the best investments I made. The book is priceless. I highly recommend it."
3,Brings back memories BUT...,"This massive collection of old TV shows really brings back memories! Considering the state of TV in the 1950's, the quality is quite good on most of the episodes. The only problem with this set (the boxed version, anyhow) is that the discs are NOT marked with what shows are on them and there is NO master list. This, of course, means that every disc is a new adventure, If you don't mark your own, you will never be able to find your favorites again without checking every disc until you find what you are looking for which is VERY annoying.This is a definite drawback, especially for the price."
5,Inflator guage,Professional quality. Wished that I had bought one years ago. Accurate and eliminates the need for the generally inaccurate hand held ones.
1,Poor taste and ingredients,"Not a very tasty halvah, possibly because of the poor choice of ingredients.Just what we need - hydrogenated oils and foaming agents.Seriously, what happened to real food with real ingredients?"
3,Not quite all that...,"My product was shipped very quickly, I'm grateful for that. So far, I've found two packages with broken seals and stale product. I've opened one intact package and find the flavour slightly bitter and the texture a bit over-hard. I, personally, would skip this brand on my next attempt and this wouldn't be a halva I would recommend to anyone for the first time. I can do better locally when it comes to quality, and at very competative prices on single 16 ounce units. Overall, a bit of a dissapointment I'm quite sorry to say - I ususally find Israeli products to be very high in quality. Maybe Halva's not this company's niche."
2,NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN,"The box lists this DVD as Anamorphic Widescreen which this movie IS NOT! Anyone with a widescreen TV will not be happy campers. I ordered this DVD a week ago and the website stated Anamorphic widescreen. I never order DVD's unless they are anamorphic or Enhanced for 16/9 TV (You shouldn't either). Today the DVD is no longer listed on this website as anamorphic, the error has been corrected on the website (not product). It is now listed 1.33:1. Partly correct. It is 4/3 letterboxed widescreen which means black bars top,bottom,right and left. If you have an older DVD player (not HDMI) you may be able to zoom it. If you have a new DVD player, blu-ray or HDMI DVD, too bad.The movie was excellent, imaginative, and magical. Nothing like I expected. It gets a 4 1/2 rating. The musically score really adds to the movie."
5,Dora and Friends,"This is a cute Dora! It is easy for my 3 year old to understand and put what Dora ask for in her hand, it keeps my daughter busy and she does not lose interest as fast with this toy."
4,For Dora Fans,"I bought this for my girlfriend's 3 year old and she absolutely loves it. She takes it with her to school every day. She already learned the little song that Dora sings and knows how to switch Dora's friends on the palm of her hand, herself. It's a good idea to keep Dora's friends always in your sight because once lost the doll will loose some of it's coolness. But I'm happy that I could make a 3 year old jump for joy. Great gift idea for a little Dora fan."
2,waste of money,"My daughter received this Dora for her second Birthday. On the second day we noticed Dora started skipping her lines, getting stuck on a phrase like a broken record. We changed the batteries and that helped for another two days. There are times we put the frog on her hand and she says ""hello star"" and starts saying all the star things, this has happened with all the toys. We have even taken out the toys and she still goes on and on about them instead of saying goodbye. And poor Dora sings the same song over and over and her head must hurt because it and her hand clicks while she is singing.Yes, my daughter has no idea of Dora's flaws but I feel that for $30 you should get a good product. And my daughter wants to know where Boots the monkey is. I think it should atleast come with her backpack so there is a place to store these little toys so they don't get lost."
2,Daughter lost interest very quickly,"Santa brought the for my 3yr old for Christmas last year. She wanted it for months and months...but she lost interest in it almost as soon as it was out of the box. once she heard the song about each friend a few times, she was done. Dora has been collecting dust ever since. I would not waste my money on this again."
3,Clearly pronounced words? I don't think so!,"Dora is cute, and my three-year-old daughter loves her. However, I can't understand what she's saying most of the time, and my daughter, who has a mild hearing loss, can't either. I wish there were a volume control or something. As it is, my daughter cannot really use it as intended."
1,TOO Fragile for fun!,The figures are way to small... and fragile. Even my seven year old says so!... The Hulk come apart at the waist and the wolverine is way to small. The items were definitely overpriced.
3,Excellent hardware---but with one major flaw.,This tri-pod is of amazing quality for 200$ Its construction is simpler than the 1000$ models I've used at school but its still sturdy and the head is great. I can execute insanely precise pans with it. Ive used it with my Panasonic PV-GS500 and my DVX100B and this baby definitely preforms with pretty much any grade of camera. Its absolutely a good deal.UPDATE: This tri-pod performed beautifully for us for about a year. Then somehow the leveling bubble dried out. Unfortunately without that bubble the whole tripod is more or less useless. I really wish it still worked because I really do like this tri=pod. But the leveling bubble isn't the place to have a major malfunction!
4,Deep insight into the inner meaning of fairy tales,In this volume Marie-Louise Von Franz takes six fairy tales and analyses them from a Jungian perspective. Marie-Louis's insight and clear writing style make this book very readible and her use of Jungian constructs is only used to open up a deeper level of meaning in the stories not to obscure or twist the story to fit Jungian concepts. I highly recommend it.
4,Sweet story...,"I thought this story was a little rushed, but still very good. Nalini Singh never fails to make her characters seem so very real, like someoone you would like to know...whether they be vampires, archangels, shape shifters or just regular humans.UH"
5,AWESOME TV!,"It's been six months with this tv and all i can say is AWESOME. Researched, agonized for a couple months before deciding and I couldnt be happier. Not one problem, pic is great, details are great, hd is simply amazing my blu ray with this tv makes me never want to go to the movies! You WONT be dissapointed with this tv unless youre maybe the 1 % that has problems."
5,PS3,I just recieved my TV from amazon and it looks amazing. The only problem is that when i plug my PS3 in through HDMI it sometimes has flashing gray bars at the bottom of the screen and sometimes the whole screen. Only for a little bit right when i turn it on. Anyone else having this problem? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
5,Fantastic LCD!,"I compared several 40"" LCDs on price and quality. I narrowed it down to the Sharp Aquos and this unit. Honestly, it was a coin flip with the Samsung winning because a larger unit just wouldn't work in small room in which I have it in. I priced this exact LCD at Best Buy and it was $400 dollars more. The Amazon transaction was smooth and painless with quick delivery. I also bought the Panasonic Blu-Ray player and the picture is simply amazing! I now refuse to buy high end electronics at a ridiculous mark-up! I'm not going to bore you with specs but just tell you that this 1080p is amazing!"
4,Disappointed - but redeemed,"When we bought this great TV we took the advice of a wise young nephew and purchased an extended warrantee - just in case. The TV was everything we could ask for. But at the close of the 1st year it started having a problem powering up. It got worse, and worse. Finally, I called about it. The power circuit failed. Unfortunately that would have resulted in an expensive repair, more than the TV was worth.As fate would have it, I waited a week too long to call about it, so it was no longer under manufacturer's warrantee.THANK THE HEAVENS ABOVE - we listened to our nephew and had spent the extra $250 for an extended warrantee with ""NEW"". They offerred replacement or buy out with an exceptional deal. We took the buyout and purchased another Samsung 40"" LCD HDTV. It, too is a great set. But we also purchased another extended warrantee from ""NEW"" - just in case !"
2,IT BROKE!!!!!,"I have to get my TV serviced. I bought it on 3/3 and today is only 4/11. It has been just barely a month. I don't know what happened :( Luckily, it's covered under guarantee and a service person will be coming out soon. The picture was great and everything was great until the tv just BROKE DOWN today."
4,Fun for kids,"We bought this book with plans to use it and then donate to our elementary school library (since their copy disappeared). Although the recipes are very basic and sometimes a bit odd, the pictures are there for the parents who grew up in the Star Wars generation. This is VERY popular with young kids."
4,Great book to take along for a long train journey,"This is a spectacular collection of really interesting stories with great depth. My favourite is Trevor's Going Home, because it is so easy to relate it with real life. The portrayal of the two characters is simply marvelous."
2,opium for the masses,"Opium for the masses is a very general overview of the history, cultivation and production of opium. The chapters were short and left me without a complete understanding. The book also contained some outright incorrect information. For what I got out of this book, I feel it was way over priced."
3,Lots of proselytizing; little botanical info,"This is a fairly comprehensive guide, taking you through the history of opium use to how to buy or harvest it to how to use it.However, Jim spends a lot of time on the benefits of this ""wonderful"" drug, so full of mysteries, etc. etc. etc.However, my interest was primarily botanical (I grow thing like this for the challenge & novelty), and in that department it is fairly disappointing."
2,"Good Story line, but could of been written in 400 less words","While I found this story interesting, I also found it lacking in several different ways. The author seems to ramble on and on and on about nothing that has to do with the plot. I found myself skipping several pages at a time just to get back to the story. Too much history information detailed. I love details but when you have almost one hundred pages written on what the author calls the Greek Supper. (give me a break) It was just too much. I can't say that I would recommend this book or author unless he changes his style of writing. The story of Herculine had the ability to be such a good story in the discovery of her witch craft, but in the end failed."
1,Can You Say Insomnia?,"Reading this book was like overdosing on sleeping pills! The plot, if you can call it that is basic and that's being generous! I am sure the author put serious effort into this, thus the one star rating, however, cutting off words and sentences does not make for interesting reading, even if one wanted the novel to be a diary, and not an actual book! And can you say long drawn out descriptions? Don't waste your money! Invest in a comic book, at least you'll have pictures from which to draw inferences!"
2,Reader beware,"I found this book hugely absorbing. Chapter six in particular, mid-way through which I was clotheslined by an oil tanker. So eyes front, me hearties. Eyes front."
2,not all information was useful,"Yes I did find this book both insightful and well written. The author of the book thou take a somewhat two dimensional view for avoidance and safety. What about us SCUBA divers? This is very detailed about turning left and right but what about down. When a freighter passed over a couple months ago myself and my team did not know what to do. Fortunately, one though of down. This quick thinking allowed the team to stay safe but with the lack of training it may not have happened."
5,This book saved my family's life!,"The year was 1996. My family (well, my new family) and I were paddling along the mighty Columbia River, each of us in an inner-tube, when we floated into the shipping lane, where mighty commercial vessels weighted with products arrived in Portland. I had been prepared for this very scenario, though, as had my (new) family. For, lo and behold, several hundred yards away, but in a seeming direct line towards us, was a ship! Yes, a huge ship. Noting the ship, I reached for the whistle I had brought along and blew it, signaling to everyone to get out of the way! We'd have at most 45 minutes to paddle to safety. Which we did, unlike my previous family. So, THANK YOU Captain Trimmer for preventing yet another nautical disaster."
5,This book saves lives!!!!!!!!!!,"I am appauled at people making fun of this book, or as we call it at my house LIFE SAVER!! Two years ago, before we had this book, my mother, father, and four grandparents were all killed in SEPARATE huge ship accidents. If only we would have had this book sooner. But this review is not a sob story, it has a happy ending, after purchasing HTAHS, I had a very, very close call with a huge ship that came out of NOWHERE! Luckly I now had the skills to avoid the HUGE SHIP! I slowly and calmly stepped aside as it slowly passed me by. If only I had had this book 2 years sooner, my family members would still be alive. I will most definately be passing this book down to my kids, then their kids and further on down the line so never again will anyone in my family be hit by a runaway huge ship, we will be prepared dammit, we will be prepared! Bless you John W. Trimmer, bless you for writing this LIFE SAVER!"
1,An exercise in denial,"Wake up people-we can't spend our lives avoiding the huge ships! It is unhealthy, and leads to poor decision making, imprecise grammar, and questionable grooming habits. At some point, we just have to stand tall, and take the huge ships head on. So don't reinforce your huge ship avoidance habits by reading this book, it is a false comfort. Start today by going down to the docks, looking those huge ships in the bow, and shaking your fists menacingly. You will feel empowered immediately, and next thing you know, you will be fearlessly crossing paths with large trees, immense piles of stone, and really really huge other stuff."
3,CYA,"Half way through this insightful book, I realized it was written by a lawyer for the Huge Ship industry. If someone gets hit by a huge ship, this lets the ship owner off the hook. Here is a book that anyone can read, which tells you precisely how to avoid a disaster. 'And sir, can you tell us how you got hit by an 800' long vessel?' The injured party can no longer say 'I don't know. It just came out of no where!'Well, this would be admitting to negligence, if they hadn't read chapter 12, on staying out of water more than 10' deep.(there was a book written in 1070. Supertanker. The author claimed one supertanker captain trained his dog to sit in the bridge and BARK if he saw another vessel. Probably true. Who's going to argue with a 1200' long tanker???)"
2,Narrow Solutions to a Huge Problem,"Captain Trimmer's book emphasizes only two ship avoidance strategies (turn left or turn right) to the exclusion of all else. Why is there no chapter for putting your vessel in reverse, or simply trying to outrun the oncoming huge ship? I was mostly disappointed."
3,"When your ship comes in, grab it by the brass ring.","This book really dovetails nicely with the first edition of ""When your ship comes in"" and ""Wile Coyotes tips for anvil dodging"". I had always listened to my grandmothers warnings about thinking that 'your ship had just come in'. She was wary that it might be full of pirated CD's that could land you in a singapore prison. Always the pragmatist, she taught me to observe the ship from safe distances before moving in to claim it. This book tweaks her advice some and allows the user to be there for the ships arrival, but instructs you on how to construct multiple escape plans. The author leaves something to be desired when it it comes to the scenario of 'you have not been able to avoid the ship, now what do you do?"", but hopefully you don't get to that point. When that happens, I fall back to 'Wile's' advice and hold up my small ""help"" sign, shortly before being crushed by the ship. Great gift for teenagers."
3,"I've written my own, and here it is ...","Taking a crack at writing my own book on the topic, brought to you free of charge. Here it is: ""How to Avoid Huge Ships: 1. Move to Colorado. 2. Don't ever leave."" That's all you need to know, folks."
2,We need a KINDLE (or eBook) Edition of this book!,"I hate carrying books on trips. This is an excellent candidate for an eBook, especially on little boats that could be sideswiped by HUGE ships."
1,Not what I intended,"Be warned the title of the book is mis spelled. After doing months of research I found that due to the lack of room on the front cover of the book they left out a word towards the beginning of the title. It must be read ""How NOT to avoid huge ships"". Apparently after weeks of reading ( and months or research on the internet) it turns out that this book is not intended for the light hearted for it will give you chills down your spine or break it into two later on (literally). You want to avoid ships? Then you're better off reading MAD magazines. The instructions within this book taught me how to crash a ship rather than how to avoid it. I didn't notice this until I crashed into a huge ship, and then later realized that my ship was my car and the HUGE ship was an an ice cream truck. I ended up paying over 9,000 dollars (in CASH thank you) for broken ice cream cones and smashed twinkies. Thanks for the help guys you were all I could count on.."
2,HELP!,"I made the mistake of quickly leafing through this book while at the book store, and now I can't even find my car to get home!! Can someone please come pick me up at the Borders in Newport Beach? I can't believe they didn't even have a warning on the book about this. I sense a lawsuit coming!"
3,Seriously,"This book is great for those people with tunnel vision or the inability to see massive objects. Bought it as a joke and it exceeded my expectations. ""How to Avoid Huge Ships"" is like saying ""How to Avoid Walking Into a Skyscraper"". Simply notice the large tanker coming your way and point yourself in the opposite direction. For those people who can't seem to steer away from something 10,000 times bigger than the object they are traveling in than this is the book for you. For the rest of the population who actually possess a fraction of common sense there is absolutely no need to purchase this book."
4,Written years too late- read immediately!!,"Bittersweet are my thoughts after reading ""How to Avoid Huge Ships.""I think back to the havoc wrought on my now-struggling family's past. Pain stacked upon pain burdens us all by the menace of Huge Ships. Had we only known, had this invaluable knowledge been available to us the suffering that would surely have been avoided torments me.Our tears now exhausted will be saved for others through this marvel of bright futures. We may not have a future world without Huge Ships no matter how long we strive but thankfully we can know and avoid our enemy's turbulent waves. This knowledge is at long last of great comfort.Truth be told I'm surprised the Mayans saw Dec. 12 2012 yet didn't see the great promise to be found in ""How to Avoid Huge Ships."""
2,Just my two cents worth...,"To be perfectly honest, I haven't read the book yet because I sat on and broke my reading glasses but I thought I would pass along some tips that I have picked up over the last 20 or so years. I think that the most important thing that I would say is you should include a good amount of fiber in your diet. ""An apple a day"", really is good advice. Also, lots of vegetables and other sourced of dietary roughage help to keep you regular. Drink plenty of water and if you feel like you're becoming constipated, consider a laxative like Metamuc...Oh... How to Avoid Big SHIPS?Never mind."
2,not yet ready for the truth about huge ships,"When I first saw this book about huge ships, I remember being quite excited. Then I realized the undertaking that sharing this information with my two teen boys would entail. I realize I should just dive right in and go under the radar with this one. But, I am so afraid of drowning their innocence with this information. Maybe next year when our ship comes in-- that is if the dock doesn't rot first..."
4,"Sure, the ship's shipshape, sur!","I ordered this book on accident after misreading the title. I was hoping the book would offer some advise on helping me with my intestinal issues. Alas, it didn't offer any help there, but at least it did provide some quality reading while on the commode."
2,Bleak and disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book, especially with the sub-plot of a geneological search. But the characters are so trite and the dialogue very wooden. I had to force myself to continue to get the questions answered and then, finally at the end...nothing. OK, the climax was surprising, but no motivation given, so you have no idea whay any of these characters are doing these goofy things. And they are so, well, blah. I suppose this was thrilling stuff back in 1974, well, maybe not then, either. And the climax comes in the last paragraph, you see how the two main characters intersect, sort of, but I was left wondering...is that it?! What a let-down. Save your time, don't bother with this book. I wish I had the hours back that I spent with it."
5,good for the cube.......how about xbox,this game is really exciting for the cube but will it be out for xbox? Ubi soft really knows how to create a winner. Tom Clancy is a champion.
5,Beautiful book - We read it every night before bed.,"This is a perfect book to read to a child. We start our nighttime reading with this one, like an introduction. Then we read other books, then finish with Goodnight Moon. Read to Me deserves to be a classic like Goodnight Moon. It is so gentle and positive, and I love the pictures of children and babies with loving family members. I say to my six-month-old: Do you see the baby reading with his Grandad? And he pats the page and coos. This book sets such a good example -- I hope more illustrators will realize that loving families have varied appearances and cultures. Although I am a blue-eyed girl myself, it really bothers me to see children's books in which only caucasian children are represented. Read to Me celebrates and encourages family reading time. It is like a little reminder each time we read it that we are doing something special."
3,"UH-OH, Did I make a mistake?","I was up in the air between this travel version & the larger version, but decided on this one because the projector folds which is much more condusive to putting away toys. I was extremely disappointed in the size of the product when it arrived, but since we travel often decided it was worth hanging onto for the price. Now I am reading other reviews & see a lot of complaints. Thinking I better pull these out of the closet tomorrow & take a look before Santa makes his delivery."
1,crayola has lowered thier standards,"i was really looking foward to my lil one having fun with this product.. it doesn't line up at all to trace,the flaps to put paper under riped as soon as we tried to place paper.. crayola really cheated us on our money (not to mention $ to pay for it to go back). The 1st time i saw such a toy,it was in a rep.toy mag. but it wasn't crayola,i thought i could trust Crayola so i went with thier version. oh well parents don't bother"
5,"Durable, and Useable","Recently, I bought this as a present for each one of my children. I was skeptical of how well it work, but was made a believer of this product when I had my children bring it on a road trip. Works really well when children of appropriate age use it. My kids are 8 and 11. If you have a toddler, it may not work well for them because their cognitive skills are still developing. This is better for my school age children because of it's capability and size."
1,Don't waste your time with this product!,"The actually quality of the platform was decent. When trying to cut multiple sheets of paper it ripped more than cut. The blade on this product is awful. Westcott TrimAir 12"" Paper Cutter is a much better choice."
3,wash mitt,"This was just ok, Target sells a better microfiber wash mit that is much better. It is orange in color, I forgot the name of the brand."
5,awesome,must have if you wash or polish anything sizeable like your car or kitchen counters or even furniture - I really love these things - genius design to make it easy on your arms and hands - have bought 6
4,a needed component for anyone hand washing their car,"Great mit to wash you car without scratching the surface or finish , easy to use and we highly recommend."
1,I put this one down halfway thru-I'm not going to finish it.,"...and here's why. Strong sexual content, graphic rape scenes, and crude racist portrayals of both blacks and Jews make this a no-no for my list of recommended reads. I picked this one up hoping for an engrossing tale that I could share with my son, like I plan to do with Mark Twain's, Charles Dickens' and other classic historical novels. I was not expecting pornography! It's clear that Ms. Swerling has done her research, but why she felt it necessary to put her talents to use to produce such a profane, utterly crude novel is beyond me. Perhaps someone reading this review could steer me in the right direction, I'd like to start a collection of modern historical novels, I'm not offended very easily, but this one was just appalling to this reader."
1,"""sex in the city""","After starting (but not finishing)Beverly Swerling's Shadowbrook, I should have realized I would be disappointed in City of Dreams, but I like historical fiction, particularly about Manhattan. Although obviously well-researched, the history is presented dryly in a few pages at the beginning of each section. Most of the rest of each chapter relates the sexual escapades of the fictional characters. This book is a lot less ""historical"" than it is ""fiction."" If you want to learn the history of Manhattan in fictional form, read Pete Hamill's ""Forever."""
1,Disappointing,"While the research about early Manhattan is well done and the medical scenes interesting, I found the constant racism terribly disturbing. If this racism had been confined to the characters, it would be understandable and historically accurate. Instead, we have the most disgusting use of racial stereotypes embedded in the omniscient narrative. The most insidious was the use of Indian and Jewish ethnicity to ""normalize"" violent sexual acts. Native Americans are used to provide some sort of Ur-American viewpoint but at no point is their culture seriously engaged. This book was nothing but a bodice-ripper disguised as historical fact. Not worth the effort of reading"
3,Not for the faint-hearted,"I saw this book in a store in Scottsdale and thought I would give it a try. And it was good - it is a historical novel set in New York and the early history of the city is depicted well. I found the plot moved quickly but I did not find this a good thing. I wish the author had focused on a shorter time period so that it would have been possible to get to know the characters better - all we get is a thin veneer, no character depth.Incidentally, the description of surgical operations is very detailed and if you can't cope with blood and gore, then do not read this book! I actually fainted on the subway after reading one passage!"
2,"had great potential, but.....","This book had great potential. I loved the concept, the history, and the roots of medical science angle. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be an epic, multigenerational plot, became one rediculous tangent after another (especially the buried treasure thread). 2/3 of the way through the book, the story screeched to a crawl. The book became a collection of trite and profane period dialog, lurid behavior, and every gory thing that can be done to a human body described in gross detail. I'm not a prude, but this story was so base, I couldn't get over the fact that a woman wrote it. Read Thom's ""Red Heart"" instead!"
3,Essential info for people meddling with typography,"As a graphic designer, who had done her schooling in a non-English speaking country, I was constantly fixing errors in my clients' copy. Only to hear, that they absolutely think it's the right way to go. For example, in Finnish grammar, 90% of times, there is no comma before the word ""and"", when it's a list. Carrots, pumpkins and oranges.That's where the Chicago Manual is so helpful. I can be sure. And get my clients proper grammar and punctuation!"
3,"Good warmer, bad lid","This is a nice warmer and sends a sample of the ""fresh pad"" that keeps the wipes moist. It does the job of warming the wipes.But (and I saw this on another review) I've been using Huggies pop-up wipes, and I've had problems with the lid on this warmer. Either the entire lid raises up when I pull out a wipe and I have to constantly push it back down, or the rubber ""dispenser hole"" where the wipes come out disengages and I have to readjust it, which is a huge pain.I'd buy the product again, but it would be much better if the lid was designed differently."
4,Love It!,"This warmer is just great. I read about the brown wipes, water spills, etc. but we haven't had ANY problems. As long as you keep the pad wet nothing turns brown. Even when we've forgotted to wet the pad for a long time, only the pad has dried out & turned brown- none of the wipes ever did. They just dried up a bit & weren't as warm. And once you re-wet the pad it turns white again. Also, I read that another poster could only get the pop up feature to work with a certain brand of wipes but we've used lots of different wipes & they all pop up fine. I've opened the lid several times & never had any water spillage either. The lid is curved so all the water stays inside the warmer, even the condensation drips back inside when you open it. I really love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the original we got as a gift didn't work at all & we had to return it & get a new one. That one has worked just great."
2,Lid does not close properly,I like that it keeps the wipes warm but the lid does not like to stay shut. You have to press the lid down multiple times before it will stay shut.
4,Hello diaper changes!,"I received the wipes warmer as a gift. At first i thought it was ""nice"" and ""novel"". When I actually used it and my little boy no longer made a giant fuss over a diaper change, I considered it heaven sent! My only complaint is that it drips water when the lid is lifted. Other than that it is a great item to have! Happy baby, happy mommy!"
2,A waste of Money,"I bought this product because of its claim to nonbrowning, anti microbial, etc. Well as soon as the pillow it comes with dried out a little it turn brown. Now less than three months later it smells and the wipes smell that come out of it. It makes me wonder what is making the smell. Lastly, what really ticks me off is the Ever fresh pillow in it has to be replaced every three months. If you go on line you can send a check for 11.95 to an address in CA for two replacements. This Co. has been in business 30 years and has not discovered the convience to online shopping yet. Don't buy this product, let your little angel get use to the cool wipes, it will be good for them in the long run."
4,Love it so far!,"We bought this item because our last son peed on us/the changer/couch quite a bit when we used the cold wipes out of the box. Love this wipes warmer and the built in night light option. It sits on top of the prince lion heart diaper depot/organizer perfectly. It gives off just enough light to be able to grab a diaper off the station without waking baby. I think some people experience browning of the wipes if the sponge is left to dry out, you have to add water to it every now and then. Also some people say their wipes dry out... I think it's because they don't use it enough or go through the wipes fast enough. I use it at my primary changing station and haven't had those problems. A must have for newborns especially boys! :)"
5,no problems what-so-ever,"I have a very colicky baby and bought this just strictly to avoid startling her with cold wipes in the middle of the night. But it also is excellent because it is easy to use with one hand and is excellent at keeping the wipes moist. We just add water everytime we add wipes and it is always enough. I also found that the off price wipes at Babys-r-us work well with this dispensor. The only ones that don't work so far are the huggy style, and that is only because they are not designed for any pop up style dispensor."
3,The warm wipes are great but:,"It is a pain in the neck to have to keep wetting the refill sponge. It seems like it has to be done everyday. If not, it gets all brown and hard. They should have made it so it's warm on its own, without having to constantly saturate it. Also, the top is constantly staying open. But i do like the warm wipes for my baby."
2,Pop-Up Lid Won't Latch,"I received this item as a shower gift. I used it for a couple days when the latch on the pop-up lid feature would not catch. I had my husband return the item and get a replacement. The latch on the second one would not work either. There appears to be some type of design flaw. The other reviewers are correct that when you open the entire lid, the condensation from the moisture leaks out of the warmer. While this is a good concept, the design needs work. Also, my baby does not seem to mind cold wipes. I think she has become accustomed to them since that's what we have primarily used. I will probably return the second one also since it won't work properly and get something more useful."
1,Use money elsewhere,"It keeps wipes warm and moist -- SO LONG AS THE LID STAYS SHUT, WHICH IT DOES NOT!!! We wrestle with the lid which will not latch. It becomes really annoying for those 2 a.m. feedings when you have to spend precious minutes trying to latch the lid. If the lid pops open when you don't see it, you will have dry, cold wipes. I suggest another model."
1,Not worth it.,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower ( I didn't register for it) and was initially excited about using it. Within a couple of weeks I hated it. I thought it was a pain to have to replace the ""sponge"" because it was always dried out and my wipies were too. By the time my son was a month old I was using the plastic container the wipies came in. Don't waste your money!!"
3,Never used,I should have listened to the other reviews. I had this for three months and have yet to use it.
3,Kind of a lot of work!,"I like having my son's wipes warm. At first he wailed when we used a cold wipe on him, but he tolerates it when we are out of the house now (he is 4 weeks). I had a wrap around one for my daughter that I liked pretty well too. This one has a lot of upkeep involved. There is a pad that needs to stay moist that lays in the bottom of the warmer so you need to add water pretty often. And it needs to be washed and replaced fairly frequently according to directions. I have not yet washed it but I add water 2-3 times a week. 3 stars for amount of work involved."
3,Not a necessary item,"My husband had to have a wipes warmer for our twins. We chose this product due to the guarantee that the wipes would never brown or dry out. So far, this guarantee has to proven to be true. However, I have found that this is not a necessary item. My sons are just as happy with ""cold"" wipes. Also, even with the Pampers Brand pop-up wipes the pop-up feature on this product does not always work. And the company recommends changing the ever fresh pad every 2-3 months. However, since I have yet to find these ever fresh pads in any store I am left wondering what will happen to the wipes as time passes. We have now had this product for 4 months and the ever fresh pad itself is browning and drying out. Are the wipes next?"
2,Not that thrilled,"I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here, but I am not impressed. It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate. The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really weren't all that warm. I have to say there needs some improvement."
2,not warm enough,"I had a cheapo warmer before this one and yes it turned the last few wipes yellowish but at least they were warm.This one does not keep wipes warm, the second you take them out they are cold. Yes it is true it does not make them yellow, but I would prefer that they are warm, I have had to warm the wipes in the microwave until I can get to the store and get a different one. I would not go for this one if you want warm wipes."
3,"good item, not so good quality","Many people think that it's a luxury item, and does not really improve anything except parents' self-content. But I found that warmed wipes clean dried-up poo much better if you happen to miss that magic moment of your baby going poop.The reason I'm not very happy is that the latch broke after 3 months of use. And we now have to struggle every time to keep the lid closed."
2,its alright,It seems to work well but you have to re-wet the sponge that goes in the bottom a few times a day or it will dry out all you baby wipes. I bought this and used it for a month and got tired of messing with it. This isn't a baby must have but it is nice for your new borns to have.
5,Happy Baby Boy,"My son from the first time I changed him hated it. However since I have been using the wipes warmer which I recieved as a shower gift he does not mind being changed hardly at all. When I have to use cold wipes out of the diaper bag he screams and cries until I am done. However with the wipes from the warmer he sits there and smiles. I agree with one reviewer that the ""pop-up"" feature only works with pampers wipes from what I have seen so far, but I prefer to use only the pampers sensitve wipes anyway because they don't irritate by son's bottom. Also, I have never had any problems with wipes drying out I add a little water to the pad once a week and it works great! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a happy baby."
4,Must have but can be improved,"This warmer is great cause you dont want your baby to be shaking and getting hiccups everytime you change her. However, it can be improved cause the wipes dont get dispensed one by one easily so sometimes you have a pooped baby in one hand and a stream of wipes coming out of this warmer. Also, I think the wipes can be warmer overall so they dont cool out so quickly when you take them out.Overall, this is a great must have regardless of it flaws."
3,"Nice, but not that nice","Our daughter hated to be wiped with cold wipes so we went straight to Babies R Us when we got home from the hospital and bought this product. I never thought I'd ever be buying a product like this but my daughter loves it! No more crying while changing diapers. But I will have to say that you can only use Especially for Baby Wipes and Pampers wipes in it. You cannot use Huggies, they're too thick. Even then we have to tape down the main opening so it won't open when we pull the wipes out. It could really use a lock mechanism like I've seen in other wipe warmers. And water does leak out when you open it. It also says that it's non-browning and you only have to change the Ever-Fresh System (the pad at the bottom) every three months. Well mine browns in about 6 weeks and I keep adding water and washing it just like the instructions say. I end up having to throw away the last bunch of wipes because they're all brown...... Over all.. a good investment."
1,Why do you need this? Waste!,"this product does nothing but dry out wipes. Why do you need a wipey warmer! If you want the wipe to be warm, warm it in your hand. It is cheaper, easier and doesn't dry out your wipes! It is a waste of money and I am embarassed that I registered for such a wasteful, silly item!"
4,"Nice product, watch out for cord!","This is a great product. No complaints about it there. But just a warning to keep the warmer out of babies reach. My 8 month old sits up now and squirms a lot more on the changing table. A couple weeks ago, he grabbed the cord out of the back of the warmer box and put it right in his mouth, getting shocked pretty bad in the process. It happened so fast. He was fine, but it was a good lesson that having electrical items within babies reach is a bad idea."
4,Lid comes open w/ wipe,"I love this warmer! I didn't have one for my other 3 children and decided to splurge on the last one! It keeps the wipes warm and moist (You just have to keep the pad moist). The only drawback is when you pull a wipe out the entire top comes open, so you need two hands, which is hard w/ a sqirmy baby and a messy diaper! I would reccommend this item."
5,Great product!,This is one item that I have never regretted buying. It has been worth every cent. I have never had an issue with wipes not popping up or with the wipes not being warm enough.I know my daughter would tell me how wonderful it is not to be shocked with cold wipes in the middle of the night if she could!Absolutely one of my favorite baby shower gifts to give to expecting friends and family.
1,disappointed,"When I first saw the wipes warmer, I had to have it. I was having my first baby in the winter and did not want to wipe him with cold wipes. In the warmer, the wipes did not get very warm, they dried out and the pad was always drying out. The pad turned brown and stayed that way even after washing it according to the instructions. The wipes also became discolored. I was very excited about this product and I am now disappointed. I have since put it away and am using wipes directly from the tube."
2,Not the greatest things I've ever used,"I really wanted to have a wipe warmer, thinking my son would prefer warm wipes over cold. Well, we used it for 6 weeks and it worked, but we did have a few problems. Number one, the wipes get SO WET that they don't clean as well and you end up using more wipes than you normally would. Second, the top wouldn't latch properly so we were constantly having to pull the front tab out to get it to close correctly. Also, I was constantly pulling out more than one wipe at a time and having to stuff them back inside. It did keep the wipes nice and warm, but I finally decided it wasn't worth the hassle and put it away in favor of the wipe holders that come with the wipes. They just work better and my son couldn't care less if the wipes are warmed or not."
4,Love it,This warmer is great. All you have to do is keep it stocked with wipes and clean the bottom every few weeks. Glad we have it
2,MammaZee,We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better. Warmers are meant to just take the chill out of the wipes but this one didnt do that very well. The lid is also inconvenient to use - you have to push a button to open and close it each time; no easy flipping like the Dex. Not worth it!
3,costly extras with buying and changing moisture pads,We purchased this warmer then qwikly exchanged it for the Dex brand wipe warmer as the costly moisture pads became a pain in our butt!!! We didn't like having to change and buy more moisture pads. The warm wipes are nice and i found Dex is just as good...we've never had a problem with dried out wipes or wipes turning brown. As for pop-up wipes we found the Costco brand wipes are pop up and fit better than the pampers or huggies wipe...plus they are cheeper.
2,"Lid keeps popping open, wipes browning...","While its nice to use warm wipes on baby's bottom, the lid doesn't stay closed anymore after a few months use. Also, I didn't use bottled water to wet the warming cloth, which keeps browning up and there is stuff now growing on the bottom of the box :("
1,What a RIP!,"I was excited to have received the wipes warmer as a shower gift, but now I wish I had taken it back and bought something more useful. The wipes are maybe half a degree warmer than they would be straight out of the package!! Also, when you start getting to the end of your stash of wipes, they are completely dried out! We have now unplugged this waste of an item and use it as a wipes refill case and my baby hasn't noticed a difference - you can get a tub of wipes for $3 vs. throwing away a good $20 on nonsense!!!"
3,Works but is a waste,"Cleaning my son with warm wipes was something I felt was important to his comfort. Ever have someone put cold lotion on your back? Yah. So I buy the warmer that seemed to score highest on the ratings, which was not that many at the time. It does its job of keeping the wipes warm and moist. But it promises to not brown the bottom wipes. And it does anyway. I end up throwing out the bottom dozen wipes due to dryness and browning. Personal preference; I would have chose another brand."
4,Worth It,I watch my niece so my sister in Law bought it. My firstthought was what will they come up with next. I thought itwas a complete waste of money. My niece loves the warmwipes. No more problems changing her. Never had anyproblem with it yet. Well worth the money.
5,Love this book!,"I love this book and use it for reading/vocabulary in working with international students. They can relate to Rebecca's experiences in adjusting to a new culture. She is funny, articulate, and sensitive in reporting her family's escapades."
1,Cord Didn't Work,"This cord came broken. It didn't look broken, but it didn't work. I thought it was the connection, or the wrong type of cord, but I bought the same type of cord at Sears to replace it and that works fine."
5,Better then other similar products,These make picking up after my dog much easier than other products. They are thick to begin with but the end where you actually pick up after your pet is extra thick. What is really nice is that Amazon has them for almost half the price as the local stores.
2,Unimpressed.,"I read a ton of reviews saying how great this book is...I have to say I do not agree. This book dragged along page after page. It had its moments of intensity, but it lasted only a few pages and poof, back to same old boring read."
3,Enough Already,"The topic of this book - a look into the convents of medieval/Renaissance Venice - is intriguing enough that I bought it in hardcover, something I rarely do. The first few chapters lived up to my expectations, providing well-researched and documented information about the life of these nuns, those with a vocation and those with little choice. The writer's style is also very readable. My problem with this book is that it became heavily redundant, to the point that it became a chore to reach the last page. Managed to finish it, with determination."
4,Same wallet?,"I ordered a filter wallet here:Adorama Filter Wallet - Wallet ( for lens )and when it arrived, it was the Tiffen Wallet as shown here on this page but cheaper. Be sure to check that link, you might find it cheaper also."
5,Off da' Chain,I think your album will be a great success!!! I thought the album was very well-rounded. The songs arent boring and it keeps you wanting to hear more. Keep it moving and to everyone else.... Get Yo A** out and go get one!!!!!China Doll
3,"Great concept, poor execution","I was very excited to read this, because it'd been on my to read list for a number of years. However, I was really disappointed as I kept reading. This book opened the field up to many great examinations of yong women's sexuality and the policing thereof, as well as discussions on gossip, teasing, and social structures for girls in high school.However, this book *itself* doesn't address many of those problems. It has great sections, but most of it is a cursory treatment of the different elements that are implicated in this discussion. It's apparent that this book began as an article, and while her analysis is good, it's absent from too much of the book."
1,Fairly disappointing for such rave reviews.,"This was an excellent premise for a book, but it seemed like little more than an expanded version of Tannenbaum's article for ""Seventeen."" I expected more insight, less confession, and I came away knowing no more than when I began reading the book. I guess I was not the intended audience - but I don't quite know who was - was it a Women's Studies book, or a Teen Confessional?"
2,NOT the same as original,"Almost the same, but not quite. The mg. of menthol is a lot less in the new. Different taste than the original and different texture."
2,very old version and not helpful,"go with a new verson. This is just too old. I paid the cheap price for an outdated version, so I am not blaming the publisher"
5,"Silver: Economics, Metallurgy, and Use",This book was purchased used but it was in very good condition. I am very pleased with this purchase.
3,installation problems,"I have always used norton products to protect my computer but have always had problems getting it installed. I tried buying it on-line but never could install it and got reimbursed. Next bought at Best Buy and had problems. this time I got it through Amazon and still have not been able to install this Norton product. They do not have a phone number listed in the product to get help. I tried on-line and still no help. Waiting for a friend who is computer knowledgeable to help me. In the meantime, I do not have any protection since my last year ran out."
5,Preston's Best Work,"This is without question the greatest book ever written on this subject. I bought the hard copy, the kindle and the audiobook. If I had my life to live over again, I would take off the west coast and climb these trees. We know so little about the ocean but we know just as little about what goes on in the forest canopy. Preston takes us climbing with a cast of risk takers, dreamers and scientists. Prepare to be amazed!"
4,Wild Trees part of a great new crop of books on the environment...,"This book is part of the new green wave, great books that help us understand our world and build a better future, books likeDesign Like You Give a Damn: Architectural Responses to Humanitarian CrisesandWorldchanging: A User's Guide for the 21st Century.Read Wild Trees and have your sense of wonder restored. Then read about some solutions and have your hope restored."
1,One day I read a boring book,"Giant Redwoods, a fascinating subject dulled by the lackluster writing style of this book. I thought I had read a chapter twice only to realize that it began with the same sentence as an earlier chapter. ""One day in the middle of October 1987..."" Both chapters then went on to describe people who were tree enthusiasts, had fear of heights and a penchant for Dungeons and Dragons.Some info added nothing to the tale like the 3 pages about selling knives to the country club set, boooring. I bought this book to learn about the trees but got a lot of boring nonsense throughout.When the Dyerville Giant fell it wasn't explained why they still wondered what the height of the tree was. Isn't the height of a tree lieing on its side the same as when it is standing? Seemed like a missed opportunity much like this entire book."
4,Tree canopy science and its quirks,"I bought this book because I liked the thought of adult tree climbing and was fascinated by a National Geographic show on the redwoods. Wild Trees gets you into the canopy with the climbers, letting you feel the dangers, difficulties, and attitudes about being in the tallest trees. What I liked less were the in depth profiles of Steve Sillett and his groupies. Interesting to a point, but I didn't need every detail. I was amazed at the fact that all this has happened in the last 20-30 years and we the public have heard so little about it. There are thousands of scientists out there wishing for similar exposure."
4,Put this beside the barf bag on your next Air Canada flight,This book is an interesting story of the individual most responsible for the problems at Air Canada. It is a self-congratulating look of an airline obsessed boy who ended up running Air Canada into the claws of bankruptcy.
4,Exciting new chapter of the Warcraft Universe,"I've been beta testing the multiplayer version of W3-TFT for the past few months and I just finished the single player campions. As expected, Blizzard brought us another great addon.Good:1) Several new heros(1 for each race, quite a few for hire heros), all quite different.2) Many new units that changes the multiplayer playing style greatly.3) All the units are rebalanced.4) New races(kind of, you can play them in the some single player missions).5) Exciting story line.6) Very different missions, most of them are not the build and destory missions we are used to, many new missions really require you to make the best use of your every single unit, which is W3 is all about.Bad:1) Really thin manual with no story line inside; After the great manual they put together for Warcraft 3, this is really dissapointing.2) Multiplayer games still most concerntrated on rushing and you rarely got to develope high level units."
3,website stated it fit but it does not,"I'm sure the product itself is good, the first set lasted for nearly 10 years but they have finally given out become too brittle and started to crack, the tape gave out after about 6 years but this was FL and HI sun everyday. I ordered this set and the Amazon site stated it fit my 2001 crewcab but received visors for extended cab. Make sure you are ordering the right one, google the stock number to make sure other sites state it is for your vehicle just to make sure."
5,Bobby Jones soundtrack,"Very satisfied, was as I expected, quick response and I will highly recommend to everyone I know. Service was fast, package was protected and I couldn't be more satisfied."
4,A wonderful addition to the Elm Creek series,"In my opinion I thought Ms. Chiaverini created a wonderful story. I've enjoyed all of the Elm Creek Quilters novels and I believe that ""Sugar Camp Quilt"" is the best of the series. Her writing talents excelled in this book and I can't wait till she releases another book. I won't hesitate to recommend this book to all my friends. Bye."
5,Historical excitement in quilting,"I have been reading the Elm Creek novels and loving every single one. At first, I was disappointed when I started reading and realized that Sylvia and her group of quilting friends were not in this book. But the more I read, the more I loved this story. It takes you back to the days of slavery, quilting, and the Underground Railroad. When I finished the book, I was sad to see it end, but you'll love every minute of it! It's a fantastic novel!"
2,Bummed,"I ordered this with high hopes and have owned it for a little over a week now. One of the loops on the fabric compartments has already fallen off and I've only been using it for a handful of days! Did I just get a dud? Or have other people had this problem as well? I realize that it would be quite easy for me to sew it back together, but I shouldn't have to!!! Upon inspection of the other loops, it looks like several of them are de-threading. Totally disappointed for the lack of reinforcement of these key components on the part of the manufacturer.I'm totally bummed that this happened, because I love everything else about this laundry center. My 5-year-old son was loving sorting his and his little brother's laundry in this. I attached labels with clothes pins for whites, colors, and darks. It was such a great little system. Wish it would have stayed together for a month at least before it started coming apart. Grrrrrrr....."
4,Laundry Center,"Great product! Instructions are somewhat hard to understand, but finally had product assembled. It fully met our expectations and would recommend it to anyone..."
2,shuld not be used too much!!!,i used these earings and 2 weeks later the bezel or should i say stone fell out............................ ghper ropej-e rrogjrw0jg
4,Who knew,I didn't know this kind of music existed till I previewed it on Amazon. I had no idea that I liked it. Anyway its a great album.
4,Look Forward - A down-to-earth approach to Lean Mfg.,"If you are looking for a book that demystifies the statistical tools associated with lean manufacturing and continuous improvement, this one is for you. Dirgo uses everyday language to explain the role of top management, the use of teams and the selection and application of the correct analytical tools to drive cost down while improving quality. The case studies are especially useful because they demonstrate the processes involved, and show that the end is not attained simply when the original objective is achieved. Rather, one door closes and another opens."
1,Terrible!,It never cut the way it should. The blade was set approx a quarter of an inch away from the board which caused the paper to crease occasionally and then after one week the arm broke off completely. Terrible!
3,Good Lesson,Definitely a good watch. I wouldn't say it's a favorite or the type of movie I'd watch over and over again.
2,Cheaply Made,"I do not recommend this product. After about two weeks of being in the outdoors, the material started to tear."
4,E-etiquette,"""Send"", the new book providing ""dos"", ""dont's"" and other rules of etiqutte online, is a short book, but comprehensive to the degree that so many areas of emailing are covered. Much of what is written here may not be followed as we do indeed tend to dash off emails at a precipitous rate sometimes, but the the wisdom of the authors is appreciated.There is some good advice especially about sending angry emails, as most of us have at one time or another, but ""Send"" also provides reminders about content, CCs and BCCs, when to send an email and when not to, etc. A good deal of this is second nature but the book works as a welcome reference. For those of us who don't work in an office or with other people, there is a fair amount about office etiquette, so some readers may want to skip those sections, but the narrative is crisp and ""Send"" is a solid and often fun read."
5,These guys are the bee's friggin' knees!,"These guys not only know how to put out great rockabilly records, but also know how to deliver all of the different variations of what was going on in it's heyday. They've got your revved up, swingin' tunes, as well as all of the slow-dancing ballads. That's not all, either. These guys are dynamite playing live shows. They never stop! And, at the end, they play a great rendition of ""Rebel Rouser"", and halfway through, the whole band exchanges-and solos- on each other's instruments. If you're a rockabilly rambler who's lost in time, when you hear this record or see them live, you'll believe you're not lost at all."
4,"Funny, in an off beat sort of way!","I saw the movie fist,so I always assumrd Allen to be older than he was in the stage direction, eighteen and shamefully beautiful. I like that, gives you sort of an insight into the character. Definately one of my top three plays. Thorch Song, Inherit the Wind, ond The Ubu Plays, in that order. Makes me wish the movie had been reviwed on 'In Living Color', two snaps up, and around the world"
4,"Durable, portable fun","We purchased this item for our two kids a couple of years ago, and it's still going strong. We filled it with ground walnut shells (the kind you can find in pet stores) as a non-toxic alternative to sand. I like that you can pick it up and move it -- we follow the shade around in our back yard. :) I also like that it has a lid, so you can shut out the neighborhood cats. My only complaint is that the lid is not completely water-tight, so it needs to be stored under shelter in wet weather."
4,Content with product for cost,"The product arrived on time and in good shape. It was very easy to put together. It holds a good amount of sand for the kids to have plenty to play in. It was a little shorter than I anticipated, but I did not really look at the dimensions before I purchased it. The lid is a nice option but seems to need time for the elastic bands that keep it closed to stretch out a little. It is challenging to get the lid on at first, but anticipate it will get easier with time. Overall, it is a great product. My kids enjoy playing in it and it is really nice to have the toys provided with the table. I much prefer this to a sand box that they can climb into. Much quicker clean up. I would recommend it for a family who is looking for a fun and creative way to get your kids outside, using their hands and being creative!"
4,Solid sand table,"After countless hours of research, we finally broke down and purchased this sandbox. It has a pretty solid construction, it took a few tries to get the legs in during assembly, but that is all the assembly that is required. It is pretty sturdy and doesn't shake or wobble. This sand box is not going anywhere anytime soon. It comes with a cover which is secured by two elastic hoops. So far it has managed to keep bugs and animals out, but it is not water proof. After a good rain I opened it to find the sand inside had become damp. It managed to keep the majority of the rain out so it is not filled with water. To be honest, the damp sand is better to play with. We are pleased with the purchase and would recommend this product to anyone."
3,Leaky Sand Table,Well made EXCEPT holes in cover for elastic tie-downs are in such a position that rain water flows through holes and directly into sand! Fortunately this defect is easily corrected by filling holes with Silicone Caulking made for exterior use.
5,Great Sandbox,"The only thing wrong with this toy is that when it rains, it collects water in it. Which will eventually blend with the sand so you don't need to add water for building castles etc. Just don't really like that the water puddles in it making a mess of slop."
4,sand table,"Good overall sand table. I thought it might not be deep enough but it is a good depth for what the kids need. It doesnt seem to keep their attention as long as I thought it would and there isnt any extra room to keep shovels and buckets, but i just keep those next to the table in a rubbermaid bin. Lid seems to work well, but i havent checked it after a big storm yet."
5,Sand 'o fun!,"I ordered this for my almost 2 year old nephew. I've watched my other niece and nephew spends hours, literally, playing in the sand, so I ordered one for him, and he loves it of course.It was easy to put together, took about 2 minutes and it is the perfect height for him. I always enjoy ""step 2"" products, and this did not disappoint."
4,great outdoor fun,"My three kids love this sandbox, and it's much neater than one where they sit down in it and get all sandy. It's at the right level for them to stand, or you can use wooden blocks for seats next to the sandbox."
3,Don't leave this table outside in the rain,"Purchased this sand table for my grandkids to keep on the deck. Be forewarned that the lid does NOT keep out the rain. After the first rain we had to dump & trash the contents. After thoroughly cleaning it out and letting it dry out....we brought it inside and filled it with beans instead of sand and the grandkids love it. Nice table, but the lid does not keep out the rain."
2,Dense prose and opinions not backed up with evidence,This book provides a lot of food for thought but not much that would help yo to accept his thesis. This is another of those books using scare tactics to make you think that memes are spead primarily by infectious agents and you had better watch out because they are often harmful. I ended up believing less than half of what he had to say but feeling that he had given me a lot of things to look into and check out for myself. He did not provide me with many resources with which to do it
5,Love my camera,"This is the third Canon camera I have owned, previous were Elph's. This is a great camera, compact fast and easy to use."
3,broken already,i had this camera for 8 months and now its frozen and doesnt work. other wise worked great!
4,Disney Princess Vanity,"We purchased this vanity for our daughter's 4th birthday. It is much sturdier than the other plastic vanities we had seen in the stores. It's also an approprite size for her age, the others were much smaller. It was easy enough to put together and appears to be of good quality. Our daughter loves it!"
3,Where was the proof reader?,"Puzzles are interesting, but too many errors in printing as one of the other reviewers noted. In one case, I disagree with the answer. In another case, there were multiple answers, not noted by the author. And there were instances, ( more than one) where the author referenced non-existing statements in the puzzle."
3,Probably good,"My boyfriend picked this up for me, and then we realized that it doesn't work with the k-x. Which is a pretty big bummer. It would be nice if they specified that in the item description, but it doesn't say anything there. Oh well."
2,The Pentax Cable Switch Lasted Only a Few Uses and Failed Today During a Critical Shoot,"After purchasing the Opteka cable switch and having it lose its focusing function in less than a year, I decided to buy the Pentax switch. I wasn't quite sure what the other reviewers were saying about the Pentax cable being too short, the length seems to be just fine.The Pentax cable switch seems to be working OK, including the focusing function. We'll see if this continues for a while and how well it holds up.B. Schollesp.s. The Pentax cable switch failed today while shooting a critical kayak race with a 500mm lens mounted on a tripod. Had to bump up the ISO and shoot hand held! Damn! I'm going to go to Radio Shack, see if I can buy a new pin adapter and make my own freaking switch. Not happy. July 7, 2012.B. Scholles"
3,It works well but pricey.,Seems like a lot of cash for a simple push button and some wire. Does the new Pentax owner have a choice? Unfortunately not. People who have owned camera equipment for years will be surprised to find their existing cable releases are extinct.
5,Finally stretched his way to DVD!,"For Years, there have been rumors that The Plastic Man Comedy Show would be released on DVD.In 2009, Warner Bros. has made the rumor come true!Plastic Man: The Complete Collection is stretching as a 4-disc set, on September 1, 2009!This a perfect way to celebrate 30 years, since The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show!"
1,"Great idea, but.....",I bought this for my two year old daughter and returned it. It actually made napping in the car worse because it pushed her head forward.
3,This isn't a how-to book unless your Lego kit has 2 millions pieces plus...,This is a book illustrating the Lego brand and what would/could be possible IF a person had unlimited Lego parts. My 12 year old is interested in this book but I can see that after a few looks through the book he's going to be bored with it b/c he doesn't have a chance of building massive creations like this book illustrates and we're not going to a Legoland anytime soon. My six year old gave it a brief glance and was on to other things.There are how-to idea books out there.It's not a bad book by any means just be aware of what you are buying. I knew somewhat what I had bought but had hoped for some creations a mere mortal child might be able to duplicate with his/her own set of Legos. A Sydney Opera house large enough for an adult to sit inside is beyond what we can do at my house... ;)
4,The ultimate sales book for hunting whales ( 4 1/2 stars),"Mastering the Complex Sale is the ideal book for ""whale hunting"" or going after the really big, really comlicated sale. In my business (government IT), sales cycles are long and complex, not the ""one call close"" Fuller brush type.Thanks to the author, I now have a game plan for going after the big game."
5,Westek 2 Level Touch Dimmer,Received promptly. Easy to install. Works fine. Used to control 2 sets of Westek 12v 3 light Xenon undercabinet lights. Used this product before. Great dimmer.
5,"Excellent Product, Fast shipping",Great Product and fast shipping. I got it up and working in like 10 minutes. Add a new dimension to something I built.
4,Good Resourse,"The book describe one mans personal history of how he became a 6 figure psychic and what he learned along the way. Listing as much useful info as possible from start up to a psychic fair checklist.It is a decent business guide with some kind advice on how to manifest money.I recommend this book if you have even the slightest inclination to do psychic reading professionally.Dantalion Jonesauthor of""The Handbook of Psychic Cold Reading""and lots and lots of other books too."
4,Great information for beginners!,"If you are a beginner or someone returning to fitness after a long absence, this is a great book that really does a good job of emphasizing the importance of doing anything other than sit around. If you are someone who is familiar with working out or who is already fairly healthy this may provide you with some few hints, but I would stick with Getting Stronger for the strength training and Stretching for flexibility. I'm a half-way in shape 35 year old that exercises somewhat regularly and this book was just a little too rudimentary for me. I was looking for more involvement with the Lifelong Fitness portion of the title, but found it to be more towards getting people started."
1,Missing Pages,"I just received this book from Amazon and was greatly dismayed to find that pages 119 - 150 are missing, and pages 89 - 118 are repeated in their place. That's like Ford shipping a car with the engine installed in the trunk - what a basic mistake! Now I have to go through the effort to return the book and wait 7 - 10 days for a refund after they get it back!"
2,Deceptive item photograph,"Searched for this based on Eureka's part number for a 3-pack of filters. Item photo shows the standard Eureka 3-pack bag, but when item arrived it was only a single filter. It's the correct filter for the application, but I feel that it's incredibly deceptive for them to use the 3-pack as the item photo when you're really only buying a single filter. I will not buy from B&M Housewares again."
5,Fast and easy,I loved ordering my vacuum parts online. It was easy and convient without the hassle of searching for them in the store.
4,Wonderful surprise for Waitresses fans,"Do you ever think, ""man it would be great if they put out a DVD of ---."" But you never expect it to happen. For me it would be a complete video of the Who Live at Leeds, or maybe a Beatles set in Hamburg. Or a Waitresses concert! 25+ years after the quirky but catchy band made their magic for too short a period, we have what appears to be a fairly complete show by them. You'll feel like you're right up front in the smoky, claustrophic club. The sound is pretty good, and the video is adequate, although it appears at times to be shot through a dirty ashtray. Mostly it's just fun to watch and enjoy Chris Butler and the unique and much missed Patty Donahue. If you fondly remember this great, underappreciated band, you have to own this DVD."
5,Friggin' Sweet!!!,"How great is this CD?It has a cool cover of the song Mexican Radio and best of all is the hidden 14th track at the end of the CD,Rattlin' Bog,performed live!!! The speed with which singer Jason DeYore sings Rattlin' Bog(an old Irish song)is phenominal,buy this CD,now!!"
2,Fast & Furious 4 Movie Collection,I was so excited to be able to get this collection for my hushband at a great price. The first movie was just what you would expect but half way into the second movie it started skipping. My hushand being the moive buff he is took it out and cleaned the dvd thinking that would take care of the problem. Sad to say it did not so he asked me to return for exchange. After checking the return policy I found that they only will take back with a 50% credit. I have enjoyed shopping with Amazon but will not purchase DVD's from them. I should have checked the return policy before I made my purchase but since I did not then I am out one movie.
2,Rehash of old news,"Some bright spots, good general overview of world wide wine. Falls down on Major new areas, especially in California."
3,Let's be careful.,"I have to admit I like this book much better than Wine for Dummies, but I still think she went a bit overboard. I felt a bit unsatisfied after completing this book. While I have to give her credit; she knows wine more than any one person I have ever met. I just felt as though she was talking over my head and I had to read the same thing over and over to comprehend."
3,"Wow, overkill.","Talk about not being able to see a tree for the forest. To much information. Definitely, Information Input Overload. Tried to do much, and perhaps did, but way to much info for a beginner."
4,Very detailed and comprehensive book...,"Karen Macneil shows us the wine world in a very detailed and organized way. This book contains very valuable information for those who loves wine. I have many friends that share the passion for wines that have bought this book and we gather to comment about the information in it regularly and recommend it to every person we know that may want to know more about wines. This book is that good! It goes into the details, very well explained, of the making of the wine...and why wines are the way they are according to their variety, location and winnery. It also teaches you what to look for in a wine and to find best values for your buck.Great reference book!"
4,Good reference / educational reading,"This is a thick book with lots of information on everything! It's like an encyclopedia of wines. I bought 4 of these as gifts and kept one myself. The gifts are to folks who are avid wine collectors and casual drinkers. The feedbacks are slow to come back as most don't have time to go through them.For myself, the reading is educational. It's more so when I am looking up a specific type of wine or brand or winery. Good reference book to have around."
4,The Wine Bible,Really comprehensive. Can be used as a go-to reference or an interesting cover to cover read. Just what I needed as I began a job at a local wine store.
4,BIG BOOK,"The wine bible is great for looking up questions and small details. It really is just too large to sit down and read from start to finish. However, it is a WONDERFUL wine tool for looking up questions and getting comprehensive and thorough answers. A definite must have for a wine lover!"
4,A Great Gift!,"I'll let you read the other reviews for a detailed analysis of this book. I just want to mention that this is a THICK paperback that's chock-full of wine info - and it's a terrific, reasonably priced gift idea for the wine lover in your life. I bought 2 of them for Christmas gifts. I'm glad I spotted them on Amazon!"
5,Perfect for beginners (and professionals),"I believe that this book knows *exactly* what it wants to be. It doesn't try to be as comprehensive as either ""The World Atlas of Wine"" or ""The Oxford Companion to Wine"". What this book is trying to do is appeal to everyone, and be considerably more accessible than the books referenced above. I recently gave this as a gift to my father-in-law who was interested in learning about wine. This was the only book I even considered giving to him. It contains enough information to get someone started, and make them thirsty enough to want more. I would probably follow this up with either ""How to Taste"" by Jancis Robinson (speaking of thirst...)."
5,THE LASER DISC. WAITING FOR THE DVD ARRIVAL,"As soon I receive this order from Moviemars, bought last July, I promise that I wil do my review here. I hope Moviemars fill his promises of delivering the item, already paid."
2,Big dissapointment,"I searched for a copy of this for a while now. I'm left wondering why. Aside from a few (very few) standout tracks, this album is a real disappointment. I would much rather listen to the original versions of these songs."
2,Not as good as others,"I listened to a tape of Louise Hay's about fear from the library and it was so great so I ordered this. But this one is annoying to listen to because instead of the affirmations saying ""I am safe"" etc, it says ""I am safe. You are safe."" because Louise Hay says the affirmation that you are supposed to hear and then she also says the subliminal message that you usually don't hear. The other track just has music with the subliminal message under it. But there isn't any track that has just the affirmations (I am safe) with the subliminal part (you are safe) hidden. It is distracting to hear ""I am safe. You are safe."" I don't know why they did it this way."
5,furniture sliders,"these work good on furniture but I use these on boards that I use for hobby work that I lay on our kitchen table to keep from scratching the table they work great for that. there about 1/2"" thick will being buying more for other Ideas I have well worth the money."
4,If You haven't seen them live yet...,"This is the next best thing! One of their earlier performances before the release of their latest album ""Livin' The Luxury Brown"" this live cd gives you just a ""taste"" of how dynamic this group truly is. That true talent of this group shines as you listen to their classic tracks that sound like they could have been newly released yesterday. For all Mint fans and true musicians, this is a MUST."
3,It was OK...,"It was OK...but It was smaller than I thought.If you are considering to buy those becouse of those design,I will recommend you to get bigger size..."
2,Zermatt Daypack,"This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zippers"
3,Review on Zermatt,This daypack serves its purpose. I haven't had a problem with the zippers and i've used this quite frequent with loads of books. The straps aren't too bulky so it would fit a female and a male. This is worth the +/- 30 bucks you spend.
3,It's OK,Expected a better quality. Would not recommend buying it. Expected a better quality. Would not recommend buying it. Expected a better quality. Would not recommend buying it.
5,Worth the Price,"Good ingredients without common allergens and it doesn't contain any weird ingredients that I've never heard of.It's not delicious, but I don't mind it. It dosn't taste as bad as the other green supplements I've tried, and if you don't like the powder the pills are a convenient alternative. It's hard to gauge effectiveness, but I'm convinced that it makes a difference. If nothing else the probiotics work well. My stomach seems to feel beter when I take these. Also,this is one of the few products without wheat grass in it, for anyone who may have a wheat allergy."
1,dishonest packaging - unappetizing greens powder,"I bought one of these today, and opened the box only to discover that it had a false top (the real top of the box is about 1/2 inch below). As I took the jar out, I thought ""I'm gonna be really mad if this jar is half empty."" Amazingly, it was! Actually it was MORE than half empty. That's like about 4 inches of empty space! That is false advertising.It's disappointing because not only is the packaging deceiving, but the powder tastes very bad and very ""thin"" compared to many other greens products I've used.I'm shocked because New Chapter's vitamins are the best! They really work."
5,The standard work on typography,"In this third edition of what must surely be the standard work on typography Robert Bringhurst keeps this work up to date with recent developments, such as the Open Type format. In keeping with its subject the book is excellently designed, printed and produced."
2,Hard Read,"This boks is considered a must buy book for any one in typography or graphic design. I do not enjoy it one bit. It is a hard read, and it loses my interest. It is not good for reference at all and because the paragraphs are so long winded that you could not find what you were looking for. This may be a book more for the advanced typographer or designer, definatly not for a beginner."
4,"Elements of Typographic Style, Bringhurst","An excellent book; extremely densely written. Everything you wanted to know about typography: rules, opinions and explanations of good typesetting, spacing, design, structure of the book, creating the page (with mathematical structural references and histories). There is a chapter on analphabetical symbols. Appendices A through E cover extensively the working alphabet (international)- including the alphabets of many type faces; characters; terms; type designers; and typefoundries. His first rule: respect the text."
5,Intelligent look at type,"After you read this book you will never use all those silly fonts again. If you work or ever want to work with type in a design, book, logo, etc... then this book is a must have to understand the principles beyond that of MWord and the like. Even though some parts are a bit dry, overall this book is a surprisingly enjoyable read."
3,Is it murder or suicide in the luxury houseboat?,"Luxury yachts and houseboats were popular venues for murder during the detective fiction vogue of the 1930s. Freeman Wills Crofts opts for a large houseboat, moored in the Thames at the time for the Henley Regatta to present us with the discovery one morning in a locked cabin of the millionaire houseboat owner Andrew Harrison. Motives for murder abound, as we see as the first quarter of the book presents us with the final months of Andrew Harrison's life, but death appears to have been by accident or suicide.Crofts devises an ingenious variant on the locked room (cabin) murder mystery here, and contrives to direct us (and Detective Inspector French) to choose the wrong suspect, but is otherwise not in his best form in this 1938 novel."
1,"Pitiful, willful ignorance.","This book is interesting only as an shocking example of a person attempting to twist facts to support a premise he cannot bring himself to question. As I read it (and I confess I could not finish it) I was reminded of Cinderella's ugly step-sister hacking at the crystal slipper trying to get her big foot into it. It doesn't fit, Mt. Morris."
1,read the warnings!!,"Do not use the canopy on the pack n play if there is even the slightest hint of a breeze.. save yourself and your baby from the tears that you will shed when a slight breeze comes along and picks that whole unit up off the ground and flips over, faceplanting your child into the dirt. It didn't take much for this to happen to me. Luckily, my son did not get hurt.. but moms.. take me seriously.. IT DID NOT TAKE MUCH. I would have marked no stars on this but I had to use at least one to make my comment in this review space."
3,"Good sun protection, but does not keep pets out","Great for blocking sun and bugs. But, it doesn't keep your pets out. Our curious cat jumped from the floor to the top of the canopy and it collapsed. It's not sturdy enough to keep a 7 lbs cat out. Though, I don't think it was designed to keep pets out, so use it protect baby from sun and other elements."
5,Great!,"The robe is great! It is comfortable, warm, and is just awesome. I would recommend it to anyone!"
5,Very unique & stylish,"The ring is very pretty and stylish. I wear it a lot, so it has taken several hard knocks and the stones are still looking good. People comment on it and ask where I got it.Some of the reviews say it is hard to adjust, I don't agree. You should buy your size, but if it needs to be adjusted, you can do by hand."
5,Buy it!,"I've had my eye on this ring for a while. Finally, last weekend I decided to buy it. It arrived yesterday, and all I can say is WOW. It's absolutely gorgeous. The colors are beautiful and play the light very well (just wait 'til you see it in natural sunlight). I wear it on my middle finger and it's comfortable. What a unique piece of jewelry. Don't hesitate to buy this ring--it's gorgeous and the price is right."
4,Unique and fun!,This ring is supposed to be adjustable but I needed pliers to make it a little smaller- but that is my only complaint. I've gotten many compliments on it. The stones are beautiful and the same colors as shown in the photo. It also goes with everything.
2,Most boring Air record to date.,"This new one is pretty lame. It contains some of Air's most lazy and unoriginial work so far. As a huge fan of Moon Safari, The Virgin Suicides Soundtrack, and especially Premieres Symptomes...I was quite disappointed with Pocket Symphony. And Walkie Talkie for that matter. This groups been going downhill for a while. Get something interesting instead. Like the new Chromeo record. Or hell, the old Chromeo record. Or watch the Air movie, ""Eating Sleeping Waiting Playing,"" to find out what dolts these guys really are."
3,Decent but rather dull!,I own most of Air's cds and would say this latest effort sounds alittle lifeless flat and uninspired. Its a decent rainy night listen but there seems to be a pretty sharp downturn in production and in overall songwriting. Many of the songs sound the same - the piano is used alot but played rather lethargic. The first track was pretty good as are the guest vocalist tracks but atleast half the album sounds like ambient brian eno-esque bsides. Ive given it a chance and do play it at night but find myself not really paying attention to most of it. You could do worse but for Air this is a rather tepid affair.
4,"nice form factor, good looking picture","This is a nice looking TV - I have this in my home sitting on a mantle over a fireplace. The picture is great, though I think it does suffer from the same issue as most LCD displays - black levels that could be more black. This is especially apparent when viewing a movie in the dark.Also, oddly, it seems as though the volume control is ignored for the first few seconds the TV is turned on. This can be a problem if the set is turned on and the volume is too loud for the time of day (perhaps others in the house are sleeping)."
1,this hat,"this hat is really really small. only good for a little kid, if even that. it was a waste of my money"
3,rasta beanie,"this item arrived quickly and was in perfect condition. the reason i am giving it 3 stars is because its VERY small, its like its for a kid to wear, and the beanie in the picture is not the beanie i received. it has the same colors but mine has a thin black stripe at the bottom, and four thick stripes which are the red, yellow, green and another black stripe at the top. it is still an alright beanie but i would have rather had the one that was pictured. i more than likely wont wear it, ill probably end up giving it to one of my friends."
3,Hand Crocheted Rasta.,"Beautiful colors just like the one inthe picture but way to small.Although it does stretch, you canget a headache if worn to long."
3,Too Concerned with Kraft's Book,"Carpenter spends a large portion of this book refuting what Chris Kraft wrote in his book, ""Flight"", too large in my opinion. I did find his story interesting and I think he could of told his story without making specific rebuttals to Kraft. On the positive side, this book is a nice addition to my NASA library since it focuses so much on the Mercury missions, compared to the many books written on the Apollo program."
2,He needed a hug,"While the parts about his time at NASA were interesting and somewhat informative, the first fourth of the book depressingly focuses on how his mom was always sick, (and a sucker for a cheater), while whining that his daddy didn't love him. Considering that he was in his 70s when the book was written, and these sad events took place in the 20s and 30s, is a bit much. As if dad not writing him letters kept him from doing well in school and eventually becoming an astronaut? Gimme a break!"
2,Disappointing,"I gave up halfway through Destiny, not because the writing isn't terrific-it is-and not because Parks has nothing to say-I find him to be a very astute commentator on a variety of issues (the trouble with marriage, national identity, etc.). But maybe that's the problem: Parks' is grappling with issues more than telling a story. Which is fine sometimes, but here it's heavy-handed and dull. Maybe I'm biased because I read Parks' last book, a book of essays called ""Adultery and Other Diversions"" which touches on the same issues with much more success. His narrative approach in non-fiction is superior to the tact he takes in Destiny (some of the essays in ""Adultery"" read like short stories). I might have forgiven all this if the book was funny. Which it isn't."
2,not the same as the one I used years ago,"This Maja fragrance is not the same fragrance as the one I used many years ago. I think they must have changed the formula. I do not care for this scent -- it's a matter of taste, of course. The old Maja scent seemed much lighter, more floral, and just a -- clean --- sort of smell. I was disappointed."
3,Buy some crazy glue,"My 4-year-old was introduced to the ""Spider-man"" films earlier this year and was instantly smitten with the sinister Green Goblin. My mission for Christmas was clear: he had to have a Goblin.On the one hand, the toy is fine -- it looks just like the character in the movie, and was hands down my son's favorite Christmas present. At the same time, it can be a source of constant frustration. The glider falls apart nearly every time he touches it, and from what I've read, this is a common complaint about this toy. Bottom line: the Goblin is a cool addition for your little web-slinger's collection, but expect a few headaches."
3,"Open Scroll 16"" Wide Bronze Ceiling Medallion","Item arrived as promised. The medallion was expensive relative to the fact that it is only polyurethane foam; however, it looks really impressive when installed. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because of it's cost. If it were priced at $40 or less, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Powerful,"Film covers the founding of the farm sanctuary in New York and provides some charming anecdotes about some of the rescuees. Shows the animals as the sentient beings they are. Takes you to a chicken factory where a hurricane struck. Gives insight into Howard Lyman and how he became a vegan, Harold Brown who works with the farm and was once a farmer's son, and so on. The most poignant part is what looks like PETA footage: calf auctions, a calf with a broken leg hanging and nobody caring to repair it, and animals thrown down a chute, all while the great music of MOBY plays in the background -- a tear-jerking section that hopefully at least gets you committed to taking some action on behalf of farm animals. It ends with the story behind Amazing Grace, and the soothing sounds of the melody, and then a final visit at the farm. Great film."
5,This is great,I am very pleased with my new Mayta Puriclean for the Refrigerator.Will continue ordering from here as needed.
4,yes it does work,"Maytag ""change filter"" lights are not automatic - you have to manually reset the light. So long as the filter fits into the filter well, doesn't leak, and water flows to the dispenser it is working. You can download missing owners manuals from www.maytag.com."
1,Terrible customer service,"And apparently the only thing I can do is return items. But it is ridiculous that a company's errors are on me to remedy. I'm on vacation and in a small place. Returning giant chairs isn't easy and I was really excited about new chairs!I ordered 2 of these chairs. Received 2 chairs and each is a different color AND both colors not the one pictured and described.That said. The chair quality seems good, but design is a bit odd. The part you sit on is very long and is not comfortable for any one without long thighs- unless you are slouched down.For all above reasons, I suggest trying out in person, not buying online."
1,Terrible Chair...Avoid,"I sliced my thumb on this chair within 30 sec. of opening it up - on a ragged washer/bolt combo next to the arm. I then noticed several of these combos are crooked, and it was difficult to change the angle of recline. Very shoddy build quality - I would expect this kind of quality on a sub-$20 chair, not one that was well over $50.Finally, I'm not a large fella (5ft 11in), but this chair was made for a much smaller man or for women. I'd say if you're on the lower side of 5ft, it will probably fit you to a tee. Otherwise, steer clear guys - it's way too small.Thanks to Amazon for their return policy - otherwise, I'd be angry with this purchase, rather than just annoyed by the waste of my time and the minor injury."
4,good for casual entertainment,"I got this before a big house party that included adults and kids. We didn't play it formally, but it was fun just to break into two loose teams and take turns with the cards. Some of the phrases are very challenging. The children were a little too young to know a lot of the phrases, but they enjoyed playing anyway. They could participate by reading the words, and they enjoyed hearing the adults sound silly while trying to sound out the phrases."
4,Fun for kids and adults,Our family likes to play this game together. Kids should be at least 13 or some phrases may not make sense. It's fun to play with a few couples.
2,I returned this Game,First the quility of the game was very good. But the questions were hard and actually not a fun game at all. I do have a friend that sugusted me to purchase this game because her family loved it. But I didn't agree with her.
4,Lots of fun!!,"This game is a lot of fun if you are a certain age/precocious child. I wouldn't recommend to ages under 13 unless they are very intelligent. Some of my family (mid 30's) can't seem to figure it out, or they just don't see how it's fun. I am a teenager, and I enjoy playing this game with my 40 year-old dad. We love it! I guess you just have to like puzzles and educational fun. It is mainly a word game, so you have to be pretty good with words and phrases. I hope this was helpful."
2,Bad translation,An awful translation. A reprint of the original book with the title intact would have been much better than this attempt to render it in English. Worthy to have if you own a collection.
5,Touched emotions that I had not felt in years,"I was introduced to The Wind in the Chimes by a friend of mine who had read it and recommended that I get a copy as she felt I would really enjoy the book. I was hesitant as I am not a reader but I thought what the heck I will try. When I received the book, I took one evening to read it. Honestly, I could not put it down. How did she know I had lived these same feelings in my family. I immediately wrote to the author, C.C. Clark, and told her how this book had moved me and that I was going to become an avid reader of other literature and could not wait for her next book. ""The Wind in the Chimes"" is for everyone and I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Thank you C.C. for helping me deal with issues that I had been stubborn on. Bravo on your first book!"
5,I could understand it!,"This is Butler's most accessible book. It continues where Gender Trouble left off, addressing the regulation of gender and how that affects people. It was great to hear someone finally talking about the people affected by discourse, rather than just creating new words without thinking about their effects. However, Butler didn't follow through with any practical steps besides some jargon about alliances and new strategies.There's also a good section in which Butler takes on Rosi Braidotti and the entire school of sexual difference theory."
2,Nice Idea - Cheesy Support,"The shelf themselves are made of the wire with plastic coating. These are not a problem. The shelves themselves are a nice size. The supports, the part that secures to the door and the shelves lock into are unfortunately a cheap lightweight plastic that came bent out of shape from packaging. The full length is made up of several pieces that link together - this also is very poor design. Great idea with good shelves, but terrible support. If the support parts were made of metal this would be a top notch item."
2,they don't make 'em like they used to,The tracks are plastic and are already showing signs of fatique. Canned goods on the shelf? Not a good option. The tracks aren't strong enough and the shelf sags because of the flimsy gauge of the wire. Reasonably priced but that isn't much good in the long run
3,gets the job done,"The rack is flimsy and the wall brackets are plastic. easy to install. I put it up in the pantry and have 2 of them. lots of extra space. not strong enough for lots of cans or sauce bottles, but they work for box food, bread, pasta, and such. adjustable shelves make it easy to fit stuff, I needed to remove one rack to get taller items in. If you need space but have little money, get one."
5,it really does work,"i didnt think this would really call in any dove,but to my surprise alone with some decoys i now think that when i called like another dove i had heard that the birds that came in were coming to the call,dont leave home without...IT WORKS"
5,great bbq tongs,"I already have these in the shorter version, so I knew I would like them. I wanted the longer pair for cooking on the grill. These are perfect."
4,"INFORMATIVE, GOOD READING","This is a text book with many fine b&w photographs illustrating its subject. The book explains the development of the schooner type boat from the eariest settlements in America to its final usage in the 20th century as a common carrier on the Cheasapeake Bay and the high seas. You also learn of some of the people that sailed on these craft, how they were used in time of war and how a few (too few) have survived and are being sailed with passangers today. Anyone interested in wooden boats, sailing or the maritine history of the Chesapeake and the Eastern United States will enjoy this book. It is well researched and well written."
2,Disappointed with product,"The copy of the 4 seasons I received did arrive in a timely manner, in a fancy blue felt box marked ""special edition"" however, in randomly checking out a few of the discs, all of them have closed captioning on the screen with NO way to turn it off, so you have to watch it through all that print, which I don't appreciate. Also, of the 4 or 5 discs I pulled, the first disc of season 2 either is faulty or has nothing on it, because my dvd player says loading then makes a lot of clicking noises like it's searching for something and nothing happens. All of the other discs I have tried work, as well as others I have, so it is NOT the player. I now wonder how many other bad discs and missing episodes I'm going to have. Hard to take when paying so much."
3,A walk down memory lane,"As a child growing up in Singapore, I looked forward every year to the Christmas season where the local television station would air all the classic Christmas shows including cartoons. The cartoons found in this compilation remind me so much of the innocence of childhood and the pleasant memories associated with those simpler times. Though I agree that these older cartoons do portray racial stereotypes, these cartoons are a reflection of the times they were made in, and are not exactly PC.This compilation consists of nine classic holiday cartoons from the 1950s, i.e. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, The Night Before Christmas, Hector's Hectic Life, Santa's Surprise, Jack Frost, Snow Foolin', Christmas Comes But Once a Year, Somewhere in Dreamland, and The Shanty Where Santy Lives. I'd recommend this more for adults (for nostalgia purposes) and collectors."
2,Not worth the investment,"This is a very disappointed Dvd. First of all, it is not about no limit hold em. If you want to watch a girl losing game after game with little little nuggets interviews with the great poker players mentioned. Well... She has such a bad attitude on top of it. The only lesson is that poker is not as easy as other dvd or books make it seems like.Really not worth you money, there is a lot of better one, like Phil Gordon's dvd for example which is excellent."
4,Wow,"They depicted the real life of a poker player. The ups and downs, and the highs and lows of a true gamler."
5,Best price going!!!,"After looking around, this is by far the best price on a new 128 xD card! And with free shipping that makes it even better! Thanks Amazon!"
5,FUNNY & ENCHANTING,I was unable to go when this was showing at my local art-house theater. AM SO GLAD to have found it available to download & enjoy at home. I may purchase the disc to keep & share with friends. I liked it THAT much.
1,"Disappointed, it's not working from the start","I just got the treadmill and spent all day setting it up. The console turns on and that is working great, but the belt will not move.The motor area makes a loud click which seems like a defect or malfunction. I extremely disappointed in the quality control and testing that Horizon has provided for this product. I hope something can be done about this quickly..."
5,Great Album!,"Tougher Than Nails is another great album from Joe Diffie. The songs on this album showcase the best voice in country music! Whether singing a poignant ballad like If I Could Only Bring You Back of one of the just for fun tunes like What Would Waylon Do?, Joe makes you feel the music. From the first song until the last, this is truly a collection of hits."
5,A Gem!,"Doug has captured all of the necessary elements to help you live a life you love. He has shown us how to live a full and rewarding life! In my business with Arbonne International, personal growth is so much of what we do and this book is a perfect fit. I will be sharing it with many people. Thank you for your wisdom and real life examples of people who truly have SPARK!"
3,Cheap Kit Lens,"I got this lens as part of a 20d kit. The lens feels cheaply made, with plastic construction. Feeling cheap isn't the only problem as many of the images come out pretty soft. I ended up buying the Sigma 18-125 after about 3 months of putzing around with this lens. The sigma proved to be much sharper and afforded more reach, albeit at a price double what this lens is worth.If I were to do it again I would have bought the 20d body only and gotten the Sigma lens.The one great thing about this lens is the 18mm wide end. Before this lens I had been using a 28-85 and didn't realize how much I was missing."
1,Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM SLR Lens,"This is the Kit Lens that came with the 30D purchased new from National Camera.Pay attention to the title. If the lens is marked just as the title, then we are on the same page.Don't get suckered into a kit lens.It will end up on a deep shelf a month later.Don't test lens performance in bright sun or showroom.Go to typical dim area to see what you need to do without flash to get decent results.Now put on real lens to compare.I ended up with the Wide Angle EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Autofocus for about $1200.This lens is built the same as the red banded L series quality, but made special for the non full frame digital cameras. Like most of them from 50D on down.The kit lens listed in title is 1/10 the weight, and 1/4 the physical size.See the difference here: [...]"
1,don't buy this,"It doesn't work on any system past XP, and the developer doesn't support it any more because it's been discontinued. A complete waste of money."
3,Rockin' good fun!,"I bought this CD by mistake - I thought it had the recent single ""Werewolves of London"" on it - but it has become a favourite to play in the car. This band can really rock, no frills or fancy sampling (it is a 1993 album) just a great beat that will have you on the floor track after track after track.And the track that I bought it for? Same lyrics as the single but given a ska/Madness treatment and just as good a track as all the others.Buy this CD! It is good for you!"
2,"Profibus, A pocket guide","Actually I thought it was a kind of handbook in Profibus (considering the price), so I got very disappointed when it arrived - it is not much bigger than a box of matches. So indeed it fits into any pocket. The biggest problem with this book is that the figures are so small that most of thenm are useless. You simply cannot read the figure texts"
3,Misleading Cover,Unlike the cover the illustrations in the book are only black and white which makes it harder to visualize the course and attachments of muscles. Trying to color in the muscles was useless as the illustrations are too dark. This would be a 5 star book if the illustrations mtched the cover.
1,why did I buy this?,"This book reads like it was written by a hormonal teenage boy. Characters are introduced and forgotten, plot devices are not explained ( at least twice when the hero asks questions about something important he is told "" I'll explain later"" and later never comes)and things happen that do not advance the story one bit. This is supposed to be only the first book in a series. I hope the loose ends are tied up by the last one but I won't be buying another."
3,Disappoints,"One of the worst feelings to have upon finishing a book is that it was a waste of your time. Unfortunately, that's the first thought that comes to mind here. The characters were poorly developed, plot holes (a particular dislike of mine) abound, and I walked away with a feeling of...what did I just get but a waste of 3 hours?I rarely write such pointed reviews, but this is truly an exception--a very generic book with little to stand out for it. Stand clear. We all have better things to do with our time."
1,Good placebo,"If you need a placebo for your researches, this is it. It does nothing at any dose and I tried many doses. The good news is that it has no side effects either."
4,You may already have this,"If you loved Lucien Stryk's 'Penguin Book of Zen Poetry' then you'll definately love this book, because they are the exact same book! Don't make the same mistake I did, thinking it was a new book, its not, just the old book renamed and packaged as new. When I read reviews about this book elsewhere, its said this was Stryk's latest book on Zen poetry, his best poetry book on Zen poems to date. I agree though, it is his best, again!"
1,Disappointed,"Always been a loyal Norelco fan. This product disappoints. I've used this shaving system for over a year. (too expensive to throw away). Every day I use it, I get disappointed, I have to shave the same area of my face over & over again to get a clean shave. The previous Norelco shavers I had were much better. The cleaning & charging device stopped working 6 months ago. Just waiting for the shaver to go so that I can buy another shaver..... NOT NORELCO."
1,Severe design flaw,"My 9170XL is only 7 months old, and it has fallen apart twice already due to a design flaw. The hinge holding together the heads to the body is made of a rapidly rusting metal that stiffens and breaks off. For such an expensive shaver, one would think the company would spring for a non-corrosive hinge.The shaver, after two weeks (as it says in the instructions) gives me a very good shave. If only it wouldn't keep falling apart.Pete Giambalvo (California)"
4,SmartTouch-XL Head Holder Problem,"Am I doing something wrong? Maybe pressing too hard while shaving? The folks at Norelco would not speculate. I have had my 9170 XLCC system for a year now. It gives me great shaves daily ... smooth and close. The problem is the head retainer plate or ""head holder"" P/N 422203611110. This is a plastic part and apparently wears after about 6 months of daily use. One or two of the heads will become dislocated while shaving and not ""float"" as they should. I am not sure how this happens, but to correct it is very difficult without taking the whole head assembly apart. I think if the holder was made of metal, this wearing of the area which holds the heads in place would not occur as easily. The part was covered under warranty, but was ""backordered"" and took over 2 months to receive. I am wondering if there is a high demand for this part. This system was designed well, but fell short with materials chosen."
4,Norelco Jet Cleaning Shaver,"I purchased this shaver (9170XLCC) to replace a Quadra which had seen better days (about 8 years), and I was not disappointed. I ordered some extra cleaning solution for the new shaver but it was on back order and took almost 2 months to arrive, but that did not turn out to be a problem, since the solution which came with the shaver lasted long enough. The shave is close, and is comfortable. The cleaning feature is competent, but, in retrospect, not critical.Robert A. Fink, M. D."
1,Keeps falling apart!,"It's a pricey razor yet it keeps coming apart! The hinge used to hold on the head is made out of really bad metal that twists and rusts and the head comes off very easily as a result. I wouldn't trust Norelco ever sice the merge with Phillips. To add insult to injury, the head fell on the floor by accident and it shattered to pieces. I busted out my Gilette fusion and got a much better shave in seconds flat with none of the hassle. Goodbye Norelco and goodbye electric razors."
4,Good razor.,"Terrifc razor, and one I would buy again. But I would buy it without the cleaning system. While the cleaner does give the razor a ""New"" feeling when you use it, it is bulky and inconvenient to store and expensive to run considering the liquid usage."
2,quality of soundtrack and tape leaves much to be desired,"The narrator uses the wrong names for the equipment. The whole tape is in one location in Seattle, WA. There is just a gloss over on each machine and what it does. I have a 2 year-old who watched it approximately 12 times a week but the soundtrack and tape gave out after 2 months"
2,"Nice design, BAD tracking","I really liked the form factor and features of this unit, and was excited to have my first truly wireless mouse for my recent 12"" Powerbook purchase. Unfortunately, I found the response time lagging slightly and cursor tracking not as smooth or as fast as my Macally iOpti Jr. mouse, so (ultimately) it proved unsatisfactory. I also found problems with having to continually go back into the Bluetooth Pref in order to wake the mouse after the computer went to sleep and was re-activated, but did not pursue a fix since the performance was sub-par anyhow. I have returned this, and will try someone else's Bluetooth mouse until I find one the responds as well as a USB mouse (or give up entirely)."
1,pile of crap,"Stay away from this mouse, and this company. The mouse does not work as advertised; in particular the USB recharging function. It does not track well, and would constantly loose connection with bluetooth-equiped laptop 1 ft away!! I returned the mouse for repair; the support was terrible, and after I got it back it still does not work right. So spend your money on a different mouse."
2,disappointed,"First of all, I am surprised by the lack of bluetooth mouses...mice... out there. I picked the IO Gear Mini because of a couple of good reviews I read online. However, I am very disappointed by the battery life and the method of recharging by way of the USB port. Even with the use of rechargable batteries the mouse stays fuctional for only a few hours (with or without use) and I've used two set of new batteries. Recharging through the USB port is completely ineffective. Thankfully, I already had rechargable batteries and a stand alone charger that plugs into a wall outlet. The mouse has been left plugged-in over night and it still doesn't charge completely. I am back to using my trackpad while my Mini Mouse sits in the desk drawer - a waste of money. The complaint in other review(s) about the tracking is also valid, although, I got use to it quickly and was able to use the mouse quite effectively."
3,very weak construction,"this product looks real, but, the on-off switch breaks easily, the sensor only picks up about 3ft away, i would buy again."
3,It's OK,"It's worth about $5. It looks very fake and stupid when it starts panning back and forth, because it moves too fast. I leave mine off just pointing in one direction. We had some teenagers vandalizing fences in the alley and it has stopped since I put this up. I even had a cop knock on my door to see if I had some footage from earlier in the day because of an incident further down the alley. He just laughed when I told him it was fake, but said it was a great idea.If you put it someplace where people can't get too close to it, it passes as possibly real, which is hopefully enough. If they can get a close-up look at it, especially if you let it pan back and forth, they'll know it's fake."
4,Best Zoom Lens I've Ever Had,"Of course, it's the only zoom lens I've owned other than the kit 18x55 lens that comes with the Rebel 300D and 350D. That said, it is a fine lens. I've owned several high quality primary lenses back in film days and I'm amazed at this one's quality and versatility. Yes I realize that I am probably behind the times re: lens development, but if you are not a photo-techno-nerd and want to carry one lens, this one may be the one for you."
2,Not the greatest,"This lens has significant chromatic aberration especially at the wide end, which makes it fairly useless for any sort of large prints or professional portraiture. I have also found that the reds and blacks always look flat and blown out, despite what the histogram may indicate. It is also very soft even with flash. And it's big and heavy, and if you need to shoot straight down at something the lens creeps out (I had to put a bit of painter's tape on it to make it stay).I was really disappointed in this lens and will be selling it to buy something that doesn't turn the edges of my model's hair green and magenta (even after post processing in Linghtroom to remove noise and apply lens correction, etc)."
4,What I expected.,"No, supprise, as what I expected.little finger print on the lense. But that is not a problem for me."
3,Great lens but expensive,"I think this lens is great but it is pretty expensive especially if you're not an ""advanced"" amateur. I mean you have to be honest with yourself and ask yourself if you're really going to be able to tell the difference between like a Sigma generic lens versus paying the difference for a Canon lens. No doubt the Canon lens is better quality but are you really that ""advanced"" to be worth spending this kind of money on a lens?"
5,Canon 17-85 Lens,"In JAN 2011 I bought my Canon Rebel EOS T2i getting ready for a two week trip to Ireland. Could not be happier with this camera. The 18-55mm standard lens that came with the camera is a fine lens, but I wanted a better lens for general use.After a lot of looking I found this EF-S 17-85mm lens and ordered it online from Amazon. I received it on July 5, 2011 two days ahead of scheduled delivery. I have been on two out of town trips and find this lens to be all I need in 90% of my shots and love the zoom for indoors and most of my outdoor shots. When I need more I use my 28-135mm lens that I also bought from Amazon. To me I have the best of both worlds using these lens. Used the 28-135mm for outdoors on my Ireland trip in May along with a borrowed 10-22mm lens for indoors. Thank you Amazon for doing such a good job in perscreening your jobers. I feel confidant in my purchases from you. Keep up the good work."
4,Significant Improvement Over XSi Kit Lens,"I wanted a solid all-around lens that offered improved focal length, build quality and image quality over the 18-55 IS kit lens for the XSi. This lens fits all of these requirements.- Very solid build quality compared to the kit lens; I love the ultrasonic focusing and full-time manual focus.- The extra 30mm on the long end is great, especially since it doesn't sacrifice any wide angle performance.- The image quality is also significantly better. I took comparison photos at various focal lengths and compared the 18-55 with the 17-85. The 17-85 is noticeably sharper and has better contrast. I'm sure it isn't as good as an L lens, but it also much smaller, lighter and cheaper.The only con I can think of is the lens' weight. It is a lot heavier than the kit lens, but this was expected. This is the trade-off for getting better glass. Overall I am very pleased with this lens and for my casual photography use it is more than adequate."
5,Soo good!!,Totally worth the 2 dollars!! This show is very addicting and this finale is so amazing.. Ps if you havenet seen the rest of the show you have to watch it before you watch this episode!
4,easy,easy to access worked well on my ipad and other devices.a little expensive. but was a good season to watch
5,EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED,The season 3 premiere was exactly what i expected for the new A!!!! I recommend watching it!!! Cant wait for episode two!!!!!
1,Really Contrived,"This show is extremely contrived. Do they ever even go to class? I don't understand. They're supposed to be in high school, right?"
5,I love it,I love the series. I'm not always the best critic (easy to please) but I love it. Its my guilty pleasure when I am tired of working. And the order process from Amazon was great as usual.
5,5+++ Stars,This is my favorite show and will continue to buy them as they come. I think its a must watch for teenage girls!
5,Suspenseful show that keeps you on your toes,"This purchase is so worth the $1.99. Suspenseful, always on the edge of my seat. This show is my guilty pleasure. I am always wondering who the next ""A"" is in the show. I recommend this show to anyone who likes the ""who done it?"" type of show."
5,Addicting,Love this show. Watched the whole season over a long weekend! MYSTERIOUS. Compelling. Reminds me of Gossip Girl meets Revenge meets Lost. The setting is in a small town high school. Four friends come together after a five friend mysteriously dies. The friends are threatened throughout the series by A. The friends suspect several classmates and family friends. Action. Romance. Thrills. Great series.
5,a book which is short but endless,"i read this first time as a child, and i was struck by its beauty. i read it again when adult, and i was struck anew by its beauty. this book can be understood and loved at various levels. i still haven't reached the end of its meanings. (PS i read the hardback version 'The Philosophy of the Teachings of Islam' ISBN 1-85372-193-X)"
5,A swift kick to the head,"This book is one of those books that absolutely should blow your mind. I guess the more dogmatic your beliefs are the more this book should help you understand ""unknowns"". The timing of this book was pure luck or genius depending on if you buy into the author's writing. This book was written just before the 2008 financial calamities and the timing couldn't be better. If there is two things that this book taught me were that nothing's impossible always be careful trying to find facts to support your theories."
3,Dissapointing.,"When I first heard about this book and its premise, I was quite eager to read it. Unfortunately, the book disappointed me.The premise is quite interesting and the book contains many good ideas. However, the book is marred by the Taleb's ego. I found this really sapped my enthusiasm for reading further and extracting those good ideas.Also, his criticisms of other ideas are often wrong. For example he criticises economics for not being able to deal with differentiated products when it does.At the end of the day, I found this book difficult and frustrating to read. It had some good ideas that I have taken away, but I wonder whether it was really worth the effort.Lastly, I couldn't resist making a very pedantic quibble about the cover - black swans have read beaks with a white band across the front, not orange beaks with a black tip like white swans. It seems the cover designer and editors are victims of the black swan effect."
3,"nice, but one is enough.",not enough new stuff. recent research ignored. arrogant and condescending stick is getting old.
3,Charming Short Fantasy Novel,"This short book has been out of print for years but paperback copies can be found often in used bookstores. An interesting time travel novel with themes of family loyalty, honesty, and real moral dilemmas. Set in both Anglo-Saxon and early 19th century Britain, the author does a nice job of illuminating largely unknown periods. Much better than most contemporary fantasy novels and well worth a few dollars."
4,read this as a teen,I read this as a teen. I have been looking for it for along time. Once you read this book you never forget it. Im glad Ifound the book again. Im going to order and read it all over again. I'm going to let my son read it and I know he will love it as much as I do.
4,Sci-Fi With Heart and Moxie,"I am almost exclusively a reader of detective fiction, so The Blackest Heart was quite a change for me. The plot was unique and interesting, with just enough camp (gungslingers in space) to make it fun. I was struck by the author's boldness in crafting his story. Few authors I have read have achieved this level of realism and unflinching candor yet still managed to weave more than sheer gore -- it had heart. The detail painted a vivid backdrop; the characters were well developed and got under my skin. Mid-book was a little slow for me, but when it picked up, I couldn't put it down. The book was raw and frank and humorous and smart and creepy -- all the tasty ingredients for a good read. Refreshing! Looking forward to Churchill's next read."
5,Amazing!,"I recently spent a week at Disney and order this battery as a backup to the one that originally came with my D60. I shot over 600 photos, roughly a third requiring flash. Between both batteries I only used roughly 1/3 of their combined charge. I was hesitant to buy the camera initially because of the battery, but these things will go forever! Great product and great price, Amazon!!"
1,Fraud,When I received this battery I charged it and put it in my camera. We went to Europe and it wasn't holding the charge. Thank God I had my other battery. When I came home I sent the battery to Nikon since they will test the battery for you. Come to find out the battery was a fake. Nikon sent it back to me and I had to call Amazon and send it back. Amazon gave me a bit of a hard time because it was past 90 days but they eventually came around once I explained all I went through to find out the battery wasn't authentic. Lets hope Amazon can screen their dealers better in the future.
3,Doesn't last long,"I use D40x with 18-200 and 70-200 f/2.8 lenses, the battery doesn't last long and I can't shoot anymore when there is only one bar on the battery. The camera shooter is automatically released. I hope this battery lasts longer."
4,Lovely Story! Kindle Version,"This was such pleasant surprise. I loved all the unique characters and the out-of-the-ordinary story line. I was not familiar with the authors, but will be looking for some of their earlier work. I had the feeling each sentence was closely scrutinized to pack the biggest emotional punch. A few times I thought it was a little over the top, but generally done with a lot of love of the written word.I did take off one star for my expectations on the length of the story. On my Kindle, I thought I had a nice 300+ page story. Got half-way through and it just ended!! The rest of it was samples of other stories, which I consider spam, so it left me with bad taste. There are some oddities with the Kindle formatting, but not too awful.As a reader of hundreds (if not thousands) of romance novels, I definitely recommend.Lightning that Lingers: (Loveswept)"
5,That`s ok.I am sorry too.,"Hannah!I think I was wrong when I said that I don`t need friends.I hearted my feelings.I am sorry!And I will forgive you and Lauren.I am so sorry.And Hannah.I agree with you.Leah is the best one in this collection.Cloe is pretty,but her eyes are a little wierd.Yasmin is OK.I `ve got 3 new Bratz.1.Bratz Dynamite-Cloe2.Bratz Play Sportz Gymnastics-Yasmin3.Bratz Midnight Dance-MeyganThe Bratz I want:1.Bratz Campfire-Dana(I am wondering if you have her Hannah)2.Bratz Twiins-Orianna and ValentinaFor the second time.I am sooo sorry!You are my friend.You too Lauren.(...)BIG BRATZ FAN!!!(...)"
2,"These Candies Aren't Very Good, Sorry...","I thought the packaging was eye-catching but the candy tastes like plastic. It took me awhile to figure out why I did not like them, and the plastic taste to them is why. I will say that each flavor tastes like the flavor they said it would, but the taste is just average, maybe a little towards bad. It is sad for me to say but true; I would never try this brand of sugar free candy again."
2,Save your money!,"I like the idea of this mystery and its protaganist, Kitty Carlyle. It sounded like it should be a fun and quirky story. Character development was weak. Kitty herself was fairly decently fleshed out, but the police officer Jack had no development at all, so the potential romance between them (really his attraction for her) seemed silly. As a mystery...the resolution and explanation was inconsistent with the rest of the story...names and plot points in the final chapters were not the same as what had been told to the reader up to that point, and since these were the pivotal points of motive, I was really let down,, and a little mad that I had wasted my time. Really these inconsistencies made me wonder if the editor had actual read the book."
1,This violin doesn't deserve a star,"I am a string orchestra teacher, and PLEASE do not buy your students this violin or any cheap violin! Students with this brand of violin (and other in-expensive brands like cremona) had a very difficult time in orchestra being successful. These instruments do not tune well and do not stay in tune. Students are quickly frustrated when they realize that the music coming out of their violin does not sound like everyone else -it just sounds bad! Fine tuners tend not to work at all! If you want your child to be successful - buy a decent instrument. It does make a difference!"
5,great,The product came on time and in the condition promised. I was pleased with the service provided by this company/person.
2,Quick Look Encounters Errors and Typos,"In the sections I have had to study, the book is obviously filled with typos. Sadly, it is another example of a poorly edited computer book. P.118 talks of a GetBothForks function. In the example, that function does not exist. There is a function called GetForks. That may be what they are referring to(?) On the next page the book discusses Preemption. The lines referenced in the example are obviously not the lines intended. In other words, references to lines 9-13 are probably really referencing lines 15 - 20(?) Finally, that solution is essentially the same as the previous. The first question a good student would ask is what is the difference? Of course, I guess the book does not pre-suppose a good student is reading. In summary, not edited well and therefore not trustworthy."
2,"Nice idea, but doesn't work","We ordered this book for our 6 week old who has acid reflux and has had a hard time sleeping. While a great idea in theory, the CD did nothing for us. She found the music scary and it ended up keeping her awake more than anything. We did get her to relax by baby Mozart and use that as our nighttime tool. Best wishes to those looking for a good night's rest: but you won't find it here!"
2,It's not that great,"I bought this cd thinking that it was something different than what it was. All the cd consists of is ""white noise."" A few tracks of the womb heartbeat sound at different rates, the blow dryer is one track and another track is of heavy rain fall. If I had known that before I bought it then I would have simply turned the vacuum on or dryer for my 2 month old. Don't waste your money on this. The book has more to offer."
5,Put this on your wish list!,"I had this CD when my baby was born and just bought another CD for my expecting sister-in-law. This CD really works! It is great for soothing and keeping your baby asleep. I would especially recommend it if you life in a noisy area or have other kiddos or noisy pets. Our favorite was the rain ""song"". I would set it on repeat and let it play a few times until my son was sleeping soundly (and me too usually:))."
3,"It's OK, but we made our own CD","We have the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and book, and since we like both very much, we thought it was a good idea to buy this CD to help our daughter sleep at night. It's OK and we have used the heartbeat and the rain falling sounds for a while, but we actually made our own white noise CD recording and looping my husband saying ""shhhhhhh"" and it works just as well. We also have used the radio's static as white noise and it was fine. So if you don't have the time or patience to make your own CD or find alternative solutions, this CD is a good choice. Otherwise I would skip it."
1,Don't waste your money,I was very disappointed with the CD. I never used it once to soothe my baby. One of the sounds made my baby cry. Some sounds were even irritating to me. Don't waste your money.
5,A True Lifesaver!,"We got this when our daughter was about six or seven months old and was no longer able to be swaddled. She began waking up 8-10 times per night, which was miserable for all involved! This product (set to her favorite, #6, Rain on repeat) worked like a charm. She's now 16 months, and we still use it every night and during naptime. She is a very light sleeper, so the white noise is also perfect for masking the noises of our busy house. Per Karp's recommendations, we play it at about the decibel level of a shower. Lulls her right to sleep and keeps her asleep for 12 hours a night on average! We have also used it in the car when she is crying, and it helps calm her down pretty quickly. A must-have for restless sleepers!"
5,The best! Absolutely a must have!,"I cannot rave enough about this CD! It truly works and has worked with every baby I know (a great gift) It takes some getting used to for the adult but if you crank it up enough for the baby to hear (over their crying) it works like magic! I kept this cd in my car until my daughter was 1, a must have for every new baby! The book is great too!"
2,mirror 1998 chevy tahoe DSide,Blurred mirror and incorrect plug.Overall the quality is weak and flimsy.Get a headache trying to view out of mirror.Mirror also vibrates internal mount.
4,An abstract detailing the scientific process,"Hempel is considered the definitive author on the scientific process. Here takes the opportunity to elaborate. He discusses the role of empirical fact, the role and formulation of hypotheses, and the importance of theories. He also briefly presents the idea of reductionism.This book is a must for anybody interested in science, although it is highly abstract."
3,Okay,It was okay. I didn't think the author explained anything though. He just seemed to be ranting for most of it.
3,This is not an ideal lens for any filmmaker,"I bought this lens hoping to enhance the visual feel to my videos but after taking a few test shots I quickly found that this camera is very soft and creates poor footage. I took a few photos with it just to mess around and while set to 10mm and brought up close to objects, it makes some cool looking images. Unfortunately this can not be applied as easily to the video function. If you're looking for a nice wide angle photography lens, then yes this is a good lens for that, but if you're a videographer like me, then no, this is not the lens for you. I am returning this item."
2,Monday morning piece?,I see a lot of people writing that this lens is very and even extremely sharp. Same with the colors.I ordered this lens in Feb but was sold out at that time. In May they came available again so i received mine a couple of weeks ago.Just sent him back to Amazon because it was the opposite. Made exactly the same pictures with the Kitlens (18-55 from 150$) who where way more better than this 850$ piece.I'm not a pro but don't believe that this is what Canon wanted to distribute.Are there more people with the same experience? Hope the new one is better!
3,Good optics - CHEAP PLASTIC BODY!,"If you need a EF-S lens in the ultra-wide focal length, this is Canon's answer. Be forewarned it has a very cheap plastic body. This lens did not survive it's first international trip stored in a padded camera bag hand carried by owner. I am in the process of shipping it to Canon's repair center, because the the auto-focus no longer works. I am looking at a minimum of one hundred and fifty dollars and possibly more for repair and return shipment.Bottom line: I like the optics, but really can not recommend this lens because of the ultra-cheap body. When traveling, you need to store this lens in a rigid case.** Canon if you are listening, I would pay more for the same optics in a durable body."
5,Great Lense! Allows me to expand my creativity.,At 10mm the camera allows you to grab everyone into the group. You can become very creative with every objects you're trying to shoot. It's a very fun lense!
4,Love it!,"I use this lens on my Canon 7D for landscape shots. Very sharp, great control on lens flare (never had a problem), and fast focus. Color and contrast are excellent, very little post processing required. Price is high for the lens' build quality would be the only negative which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
2,Disingenuousness,"I must state upfront that I only read a small portion of this book, just to get the ""flavor"" of it. It left a bad taste! In his chapter on evolution, he tosses in a couple quotes by Keith Ward, who is a THEOLOGIAN. Deloria cites an inconsistency in Ward's (ignorant) statements about evolution, and tries to use that inconsistency as a criticism of evolution itself. This is, at best, very sloppy writing, and arguably dishonest."
3,DVD Addict,"Player worked fine the first couple of movies and then, the multiple notorious white bars across the top of the screen appear. I'm taking it back to the store with hopes of a discount, however, I'm worried about the bars growing larger?? Will that happen? Does anyone know??? What an fn shame, and at such a decent price too. From another disapointed DVD Addict."
3,Pricey for What you Get,I have had this for 1 year. I thought the backlight did not work. Apparently it does - but it is so faint it is worthless. I do like the idea that the temperature is wireless - but - it was not the easiest to install.
1,Wayfinder V2020 Review,"The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine. The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time. I exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep Pat. She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement.The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months. It now works a bit better than the first one. Instead of stops working most of the time, this one stops working some of the time. I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement. And who knows, the next unit may not work at all.Not a good product for Amazon to be selling.R Lockwood"
5,Water Filters for Amana Refrigerator,"These water filters are hard to find, so I appreciate the ease and convenience of ordering online. Price is reasonable, also."
5,Good DVD,"This DVD was helpful in teaching my children to swim. It is well produced, and the content is good."
1,Completely Inadequate,"I bought this on all your other recommendations and this is just a terrible dvd for teaching kids to swim. Its broken into five 10 minute modules. Module 1 on babys from 6 months to 2 years was 10mins long - are you kidding me, 10mins for teaching a baby!! Other than blowing bubbles theres nothing in this dvd to help teach you baby to swim. I feel ripped off the content is so thin"
5,awesome book,"the book of thoth is a great book for any one looking into crowleys thoth deck. originally the book was broken, it didnt translate onto the kindle fire, but after contacting amazon they promptly fixed the issue and now im thrilled to have this gem in my collection"
5,Great synthetic reed!,"I've used Bari for some years and have yet to wear one out. (I always keep a spare just in case I bust one.) Good quality, good tone!"
4,Great but too big for my son,This helmet is super nice and my son loves it but it is a little too big for him (he is 1 year old) so it does tend to fall down and cover his eyes. He does not have a small head but I think it will fit him in about 6 months or so. We still use it though and it seems to be good quality.
1,Didn't Last Long,This helmet only lasted 2 years with minimal use and kept safely in the garage. One day we noticed the outer wrapping ripping and saw a crack in the top of the helmet. Not sure how well this would really protect someone.
4,Great for even a three year old,Helmet fit my three year old nephew and he loved the flames along the side of the helmet. He kept the helmet on even after he finished riding his new bike!
3,Disappointing Debut Disc,The body of work performed on this disc comes from the penof Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. The overall impression Igot was one of non-commitment to the feeling of the musicinfact an inability to enter the composers emotional world.As we know a true interpretatation of Tchaikovsky's musiccannot be feigned it must come from the inner most self.Shoda has brought off the shorter numbers of Cui and Rimskywith beautiful tonal colouring and expressiveness but fails todeliver the goods with the highly emotive Tchaikovsky songs.His 'Midst the din of the ball' a classic number fallscompletely flat with little regard to expressive detail and phrasing.It would pay him to listen to Nikolai Gedda's incomparableversions and learn from them.Also both the accompanist and soloist unduly distort thetempos in Tchaikovsky's 'It was in early spring'-distracting and unnecessary.His voice lacks tonal colour. For a more mature reading listen to Sergei Larin.
4,Effective tool,"The clamp (Grizzly G8079 Quick Release Drill Press Clamp - 10"") is easy to install; taking off from drill press is also easy. Clamping is tight. But it's shorter than 10"" (about 9.5""). The minimum thickness of holding down item should be around 0.75 inch; I wish it could clamp thinner items without extra padding/spacing. Given the price, it's a good tool (just ordered 3 more)."
4,I miss it!,"For the longest time I remembered this movie, I knew I had seen it and loved it, but couldn't find it anywhere or find anyone else who remembered it. I finally found it on this sight and was so excited, but disappointed at the same time because it wasn't available to buy. I hope that in the very near future it comes up for sale. A definite must for my collection! :)"
2,good for the kids ony,"this movie is a rather obvious attempt to cash in on the popularity the ewoks gained during the return of the jedi movie.nobody youve ever heard of isin it.but kids dont care,so theyll like it anyway.if you can listen really closely,a ewok cusses,but besides that,there is nothing to warp thier minds.it is not nearly as good as the star wars movies so dont be fooled!at one point a ewok gets killed.this could freak them out.the real deal on this one is that its cute for small children butthats about it."
1,Old Book,"The fifth edition has been in stores for 2 years now, and you are selling the fourth edition which is from 1996 instead of 2000. You should lower your price, as the new edition sells for 114$ elsewhere."
2,No evaluation and analysis,"I'm a PhD candidate in Software Engineering, and I have tried to use this text in several occasions both as a student and as a teaching assistant. I have always been disappointed. My largest problem is that the text attempts to do too much, and ends up doing nothing well. There is no analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Why/When should I use OO instead of structured methods?Furthermore, since the book covers so many topics in a limited number of pages, there simply cannot be enough information in order to apply any of them. If you want to try to analyze, design, build and test even a toy problem, there are inevitably a raft of issues that this book does not address. This book does not provide a student a firm grasp of _any_ part of the software engineering process."
1,Touches on basic concepts of engineering,"While this book is acceptable and a fair resource for a software engineer, the price is absurdly high. There are many books out there that explain the same concepts in this book, without the unnecessary fluff, and for half the price. The fluff in this book itself should tell you that the author is not concerned with knowledge, but with greed."
1,Horrible piece of work,"I was going to reserve judgement on this book until I had completed the course that it was being used in. However, I feel compelled now to state that this book is one of the most poorly written books I've ever had the misfortune to be required to read. In *every* chapter I've read so far, I've found at least one, often several, spelling, grammatical, or technical errors. So far the most damning is Chapter 20, where, constantly, Pressman cites the work of ""Rambaugh"", such as the book ""Object-Oriented Modeling and Design"". Maybe if Pressman was more concerned with writing a useful text than he is in writing one to bring in more money, he'd have actually looked at the list of authors for ""OOMD"" and noted the correct spelling of James Rumbaugh's name.Save yourself the money and get another book."
2,Just as stupid as the first one,"If you saw the first one and liked it, give this a shot. If you thought it was stupid, this one will not surprise you in any way. It was real dumb. The plot was real dumb. The acting was real crappy and the special effects were pretty good. Actually, I didn't try this, but I bet if you watched it on mute it would actually be cooler than with sound. It looked cool. But it wasn't cool. The story had so many holes in it you could barely see the cheese. It was like those old horror movies where everyone in the movie is so stupid like they've never had to use common sense a day in their lives. ""All my friends are being heinously murdered? Let's go see what's down in the cellar! Doop dee doop dee doo AHHHHHHHRRRGGHHHHH!!!!"" Yeah, that kind of complete idiocy was rampant in this film. Let's not worry about HOW anything is happening here, lets just focus more on having a big flaming head look at the camera kinda sidewaysey a bunch and run to the bank..."
1,"Disappointing, Stay Away","This was nothing like the first movie. It is meant more as a kids movie. The dark feel the first movie had is completely gone. For some reason they decided to make the sequel ""fun loving"" instead of the soul killer Ghost Rider really is. Just plain out disappointing."
3,Not Impressed,"For a movie by itself, it is alright... but as a sequel to the first? Pretty much a bomb. They made changes to it that never should have been made. One, to the special effects they made them subtly more complex. Where the original effects were simpler and in my opinion better. Then they changed not only the devil but his name! Then where they left off in the first, they changed the meaning of it in the second (remember, the ghost rider was going to get even and fight the devil or whatever? Not in this one). They changed his attitude to an extent. I was not impressed by this one. But to each their own."
4,great special effects.....,"the second movie in any franchise always has to try and be better......in this case, even though the special effects are awesome in this movie..it lacks the energy of the first one"
3,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray...,"I agree with other reviewers, this is a much more ""true to comic"" Ghost Rider, it's just too bad that Nicholas Cage is the actor. They should have done a ""Hulk"" on this and given us a new lead actor"
1,"Very, very, very, bad!!!","Do not waste your money, like I did. This movie is terrible. I could not watch the whole thing, just that bad."
2,Confused Reboot,"This film is a reboot that attempts to make the character closer to it's comic book version, but fails to really do so. The main problem is that Ghost Rider seems like a secondary character throughout the film. Nobody cares about the son of satan, his mother or the sect of monks after him. These characters take up way too much screen time and worst of all bring the film to a complete stop. Boring and pointless. Nicholas Cage's performance is entertaining and he captures the overall feel of Johnny Blaze quite well. The new Ghost Rider fails though. It's a badly rendered cgi creation that looks like it stepped out of a video game. Overall this film, while nowhere near as hideous as The Amazing Spider-Man or Steel, is a bad movie."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I couldn't even stand to watch more than an hour of this and I just turned it off. I mean WTF?! I LOVED the first one, but this one was just terrible!!! I would not waste my money on this if I were you, infact I feel pretty horrible that I spent $1.00 on this as a rental. If they wanted to make a second one they should have stuck with the same producer, because this new guy just screwed the story up completely. And the worst part is that Cage is usually an okay actor, but he was terrible in this film. Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Don't waste your money. I would have given it zero stars if I could."
3,The Rider is Back With a Vengeance!!!,"I've waited five long years for a sequel to Ghost Rider, but this isn't exactly what I pictured. I didn't hate this movie, but I dislike when they change facts made in the original. They showed a completely different flashback of Johnny signing the deal. I read that Neveldine/Taylor avoided watching the original, and you can tell. Some of the action scenes were decent. There were crazy acid-trip moments, and the Ghost Rider is grittier, lean and mean this time. Johnny Blaze is hiding in a remote part of Eastern Europe. He is asked by a man named Moreau to help a boy named Danny from being sacrificed to the Devil. Will Johnny get rid of the Rider forever, or will he embrace his gifted curse? If you're a fan of dark Marvel heroes, you'll like GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE!!!"
3,Not impressed!,This action offers quite a bit of action but unfortunately it is your typical action flick. I wouldn't say it was a complete waste of money but if you can wait for it to come on HBO then wait!
2,Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance,I thought this movie was just ok but no were as good as the first one. If you have not seen it I would rent it watch it and leave it at that.
2,Yeuch!,"This DVD was a real let down after the original Ghost Rider of a few years ago. It was more like The Batman show fron rthe lat 60's. With crash, boom, bangs flying everywhere. A very disapoininting movie."
1,Horrible!!!!,"One of the worst, pathetic, and completely stupidest movies of this year so far. Not sure how they could go from a pretty decent first movie, to a very poorly done second movie, but they did. Do not waste your time. If you want to see it that bad wait for it to come out on red box. At least then you'll only be wasting a dollar!"
3,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance Review,"My big question is how did Johnny Blaze wind up in Eastern Europe? Just a thought: Don't they know there is plenty of evil right here in the good old USA? I would have thought he realized that he can run all he wants but he cannot hide. Apparently not, huh? Anyway, I would have liked to see more Ghost Rider action sequesnces and less convulsing by Johnny Blaze. A pretty good action flick but quite frankly I could probably get more excitement out of reading the comic book."
1,Awful.,"I didnt even finish this movie, and I have low expectations. GhostRider 1 was pretty good. They butchered this one. They had a pretty good start with the first one. I have no idea why they didnt just make part 2 of the original."
3,Disappointed,"I really loved the first Ghost Rider, but Ghost Rider: Spirit f Vengeance is a disappointment. It is so far from the original storyline. In the first movie, Johnny Blaze made his deal with the devil by pricking his finger by accident, but according to the sequel, he cut his hand on a broken bottle. The appearance of the rider is different as well. In the first movie, the skull was white, he worn a jacket with spikes, and hs chain wrapped around him. He was out for justice, but not ""HUNGER"" or ANGER. His motorcycle was totally different and sleeker as well as a little scary, but in the second, not as menancing as the first one. His Penatence Stare suddenly has become an angry hunger. The rider was created for justice, not revenge. The write of the second film must not have seen the first part or completely disregarded what was in the movie. If there is a #3, I hope they do a better job!"
4,"Great movie, damaged product","The movie is excellent and it made great timing. Everything was exceptional as far as price and how quickly it arrived. My only problem is when it arrived the case was damaged. There was a tear on the front of the movie case. I feel like since everything was perfect, I shouldn't review too harshly and it would have been a 5 star review if it weren't for that minor imperfection"
1,Waste of MONEY,I hate to waste money and this movie was a waste. If you watched the previews for it then you essentially seen the whole movie including the ending.
1,Ghost Rider - Spirit of Lameness,"This movie does not even make the B-list, it goes strait to the D (for dumpster) list.It is a waste of time."
3,"Okay sequel, not as good as the first one","nicholas cage is back as ghost rider, trying to get rid of his curse while trying to save a boy from becoming the anti-christ. thats basically the plot with some angel power that ghost rider can possess, mix that with a gritty, somewhat entertaining and yet feeling like a low budget direct to video release. some cool action scenes, some not so great and some dumb moments. I think the budget is what hurts this movie a bit, with a bigger budget and a different director with a better vision. you can have something here that is as good as the original, unforuately this movie isn't. Its worth watching, just don't expect it to be great."
1,FLAMES WENT OUT FAST,"Did Nick want to bail on this movie franchise? Probably.It was evident by the lack of acting, and the lack of something as simple as a story.Hey, let's get together and make a sequel - who needs writers or good acting.Recommendation: Don't even wait for it to come out on television, because it probably won't even make it to the half-dollar video bin at the local carwash.The DVD for this movie would be useful for replacing clay pigeons at the local shotgun range.DON'T BOTHER - This movie doesn't deserve a fraction of the one star that I gave it."
2,Just horrible.,"I watched the first Ghost Rider before this one, to refresh myself with the storyline. There was no point. This was like watching The Incredible Hulk, after watching the Hulk. It's not a sequel, but rather another tale, that tries to convince you that the previous movie never happened. The movie's flashbacks to the origin changes the story, the character's powers changed, the devil is different by name and ability, and Cage's acting just got worse. It's pretty sad when the lead actor is the worst actor in the film. The storyline was cliche, a throwback to 70's occult films, and badly so. I wish I could get a refund for this waste of my time. I encourage you to avoid at all cost."
2,not what I expected,"I was very dissapointed, I did not get a chance to see it in theatres so decided to wait and watch it here...glad i did not pay theater costs..was not worth it. it was not even as close to being as good as the original."
1,poop squared,"ok, so can someone please tell me why in the name of the gods did this movie need to be made? i mean seriously???? the first one was TERRIBLE and this is way worse. And this is coming from a fan of nicholas cage AND comix!!!! STOP MAKING SHITTY COMIC MOVIES!!!!!! PLEASE!!! file this one next to The Phantom lol save your money."
5,Masterpiece !,This is a truth masterpieceI highly recommend this readable and entertainig guide to learn language. Certainly one of the few way of master a way of dominate a language is just reading this nice book.Every page has a lot of practical advice and tips that I didn't found in others readings.
4,my fave from lenny,"this third release from lenny is my favorite of his.i like some of five and mama said but this one for me is the best.the title track,sugar and heaven help are my songs.i like his arrangements the best.he puts things into context fairly well.and yes his influences are there but this album has the goods."
4,Go this way,"The only other album besides his previous MS that will stand tests of time. Slightly more consistent than before (keeping material solid the whole way through seems to be a problem for him) although perhaps lacking more of his best compositions, it is argued as the consummate classic rock borrower's finest assimilation."
1,Fairly Useless,"I bought these to light my driveway leading up to my house. The light they emit is incredibly faint. It's more decorative than illuminating.Also, they only stay lit a few hours - not the 8-10 they say they will. And they must be in DIRECT sun for most of the day in order to charge.I would not recommend. Wish I had kept the box so I could return them."
3,There is something about this book,"I would not call this a page turner, but there is something about this book which makes it so you cant put it down. The downfall of this book is it jumps years at a time. I would say it is a good library book. It is good but not the best."
1,A waste of time!,"This book was given to me by my sister and it sounded as if it would be a good, light read. was i wrong! i had a terrible time getting into the plot, there were way too many silly, overly melodramatic stories(a lawyer buying herion to ""save"" her brother, please!) and the characters unlikable(you keep waiting for them to redeem themselves or move foward in some way, but they never do). i was very dissaapointed to say the least."
1,Very Very Depressing,"If you are looking for a book comparable to Judy Blume's Summer Sisters, this is not it. Very depressing without an ending that brings closure."
4,Life's reality emoted quite articulately!,"First, title is impressive and makes you buy the book, come on, who doesnt want to 'think' about friends anytime anywhere? :-)Storyline is simple, two girls, complex as in any human, navigate against the tough waters of life in their own way. The novel gives kind of awareness of truth, reality, convictions, conventions, relationships, ethics, and so much to say in a nutshell, Life!The flow of events are quite tricky and it does give a void feeling after the novel is completed. May be thats what truth is all about!This is a serious review on a casual reading book."
4,Life's not that easy,"Like some reviewers I don't really like Clare or Sally. Actually, I don't recall really liking any of the characters in the book. However, the book makes these people real. Not nice, but real. Readers looking for artificial characters who have everything worked out in their lives will be disappointed by this book, but those looking for an honest, though sometimes painful portrayal will appreciate it. I look forward to her second book."
3,"Easy to read, yet lets you down by the end","I picked this book up at the airport and was halfway finished with it by the time my plane landed. It was very easy to read but I have to say this author managed to forget one major component to what makes a good novel- creating memorable characters. Not only were these characters not memorable that weren't even really that likable. I never understood what made them tick or even more importantly why they were even friends. With all of that said, I did enjoy the hardships and problems the characters had to deal with and overcome throughout the novel. So basically story line- 5 Characters- 1 and you end up with 3 stars."
1,Suckers Only!!,"Like all of the above comments, the biggest drawback to any of these is the awful, awful, recording quality. Who cares what the cost per movie is? I guess people who like ""deals"" like this buy $1000 cars that barely run, leak oil, smoke, overheat etc. but its ok because they got a ""deal"". Pass on garbage like this!!!"
5,Shun quality at a very reasonable price,"Perhaps not as good looking as the paka wood classic version, this knife is nevertheless a superb slicer -just what you'd expect from the first rate Shun knife manufacturers."
2,Pentax Lupe - 5.5X,"Solid unit with good optical quality, works best with a suitable light box. Look at your transparency film with this unit and you will be able to see if the edge to edge sharpness is there for sure. You'll enjoy using it as it has plenty of mass to hold onto."
3,Not nearly as impressed...,"My 21mos old and I first read Lois Ehlert's ""Eating through the Alphabet"" and LOVED it. But while ""Growing Vegitable Soup"" is based on a cute concept... I found myself disappointingly unimpressed by this one. The colors are flat, it has poor contrast between object & background, and while the main wording is large... the print labeling the items is small, and hard to read. Overall this would probably be better in a larger (lap book?) size, and enjoyed by a beginner reader, rather than a toddler."
1,Hard on the eyes,"The colors used in the book are very hard on the eyes, the graphics are crude and poor for little ones to interpret, some of the writing is too small to read even with my glasses on, and when you do make them out, they just don't make sense.Overall, I was very disappointed in the book because I expected better from a book with a 4+ rating. I don't know where all these people are finding 5 stars for this book - 2 maybe, but even that would be stretching it IMHO.A much better book about soup would be any version of Stone Soup, and I like Jack's Garden much better for a kid's book about gardening."
3,Decent,"I really wanted to like this product. I love cinnamon rolls and cinnamon babka, so I thought this would be an easy go to. The consistency is too processed and it is just a strange flavor. One is just better off combining brown sugar, cinnamon and butter on their own."
5,"Great Music, Performed Wonderfully","What I like most about this CD is that it takes both classic, and more recent music and performs it wonderfully. Wraggle Taggle, featuring Michael Doucet is a great example. Michael Doucet of BeauSoleil livens up any performance and this is a great one. Wraggle Taggle is often referred to as The Gypsy Laddie, which is a classic ballad in the Child collection of English and Scottish Ballads.The L&N; Don't Stop Here Anymore is a more recent song written by Jean Ritchie. It has been performed by musicians from Johnny Cash to Michele Shocked. The Sweet Colleens deliver a solid performance of this great tune.Wild Mountain Thyme was written by Francis McPeake and has been performed by many great folk musicians. It has been a long time personal favorite of mine, and The Sweet Colleens have done a great job on their version."
1,Do not waste your money,"I have hundreds of books and dvd's on coaching soccer, as this is my profession. This dvd is not worth the time to get off the couch and put in to the machine and press play.Seems like they had one camera and said lets make a dvd, put brazil name on the front and it will sell. The coach does many things wrong in the dvd that puts brazilian soccer to shame. Some of his tactics are blind. His drills have no point and do not have any build up. Even the players used are terrible. They must use the same sequence of passage of play about 10 times over. And the music is from 70's porn. Did not learn one thing from the dvd that could help me in further my education in soccer."
2,Falls very short of expectancies.,"It is more like a compilation of day by day episodes, hastily put together. There is iterview after interview. And very few, precious action. The ropes action, taking place in an impressive bare wall, lasted only minutes. While the get together to mourn a competitor who had an accident and lost his life was repeated over and over. I think is a lost oportunity to show one of the best adventure races, taking place in an wonderful, rugged terrain."
3,"Good, but not great","I expected more from this DVD. Too many interviews with the athletes, and not as much action as I expected. I was a fan of the Eco-Challenge adventure race, and this Primal Quest DVD was not as good as the previous Eco-Challenge events."
2,Not pleased with design of the seat cushion,"I purchased 2 of this particular booster seat for my boys after reading all of the reviews (and having previous good experience with Evenflo car seats). I ended up bringing the booster seats back to the store though, because the seat cushion kept coming out of the holes. I went to Target to purchase the Big Kid Deluxe and noticed that Evenflo does not even make the seats that way anymore. Apparently, I'm not the only one who had this particular problem. I also noticed that the date of manufacture of the car seat I bought at Toys 'R Us was March of 2003, the one I purchased at Target was December of 2004 (much better manufacture date, considering the length of use of a booster)"
3,Not bad!,"This book covers alot of detail. If you are looking for answers to setting up your firewall right away, don't read this book first. This book coveres to much information for the newbie admin. Although good, I felt like I was reading a puzzle. I felt like Marcus was speaking to someone who has a good understanding of network connectivity and security. This book does cover alot of good information. It's a good ref since there are not many updated firewall books on the market."
4,Good All Balls,All Balls always seems to have good motorcycle products. I have used their steering bearings and wheel bearings many times with good results.
4,Two more operas deconstructed,"If you want a complete Anna Russell collection, by all means obtain this DVD. But her rendition of these two operas is not quite as much fun as her send-up of the Ring. I could understand satrizing The Magic Flute but it seems to be that some other Italian opera mught have been a better subject of ""Russelization."" As I am not any kind of an expert on opera, it may be that I did not get all the nuances."
3,So so,"I wanted to like this book, with its interesting premise and sharply drawn characters. And I did read it quickly, interested to see what would happen next. But all the while, I kept thinking about character or plot inconsistensies. As for the surprise ending, it certainly didn't help that one of the other reviewers here spoiled the surprise. But I have to say that even that part didn't ring true to me. It's a pleasant read, but no more than that."
3,Way too big for women's hands,"These gloves are well made, but they are definitly too big for my hands. I have to wear them with the weight on the inside of my hands instead of on top, because they slide back and forth and have actually rubbed skin on the top of my hands raw. I think if they were a good size smaller, they would be perfect. Even though they don't specify a gender, I do think they are men's gloves."
5,Fantastic product. Works great. If only they made heavier versions as well,"I purchased these gloves to use for the Kenpo X workout in P90X. The workout without the weights was fun, but not enough intensity for me. Adding these 1lb weights made a world of difference. (In the first 10 minutes you throw about 500 punches, so adding 1 lb to each hand has a cumulative effect.)I had no problems with these at all, but I have larger hands. I could see how these might be a bit bulky on a woman with smaller hands.By the end of the workout they were pretty sweaty, so I'd reccomend using some disenfectant spray on them as well. But, despite the sweat the gloves stayed in place well, and your hands are free do do whatever you need to like grab a bottle of water etc."
4,This literary epic was extremely moving,"As you can see from my e-mail address, this book has had a tremendous effect on my life. This book was written for the lover, the fighter, and those with honor. Though the book is long in pages, it is a fascinating read, and a travesty to miss."
4,Very Good Deal,"I received this package as a christmass present and I love it! I am an avid traveler and picture taker and I find this Kodak package to be just wonderfull. It came with everything I need and a little more. The camera itself has exclent functions and picture quality.I recomend this product to anyone who enjoys good quality pictures and does not want the hassle of searching for all the extra ""toys"" for their camera.Enjoy :)P.S. It was delivered very fast and was very well packaged."
5,A GREAT BEGINNING TO A GREAT CYCLE,"Weingartner was the first to record all Nine Symphonies, and his cycle has never been surpassed. The First Symphony is lovingly and virily conducted, and the Second truly has the quality of ""fresh youthfulness"" that Weingartner mentioned in his essay on this particular work. The Overtures are likewise wonderfully done, my favorite being the ""Leonore No. 2."" Transfers are of high quality, although not much can be done about the rather cramped acoustic of Symphony No. 2. Still, I don't know that many performances of this Symphony that can equal this one.Weingartner has the uncanny ability to maintain the structural integrity of these works while being VERY flexible and wholly spontaneous tempi. His Beethoven is a must for all music lovers.However, I would suggest the Opus Kura transfer for the First Symphony and the other Vienna Philharmonic performances, as they are even superior to the Naxos in quality."
1,Poorly written...,"I like the fact that the Y2K sticker is cleverly covered up...humorous. Other humorous events are the book itself, which is a laughable collection of many things you don't even want to attempt in case of an emergency. I think I got more information out of a cub scout manual than this book. 1 star for Do-It-Yourself Crisis Survival, a perfect book for all you rugged Y2K survivalists out there."
4,All star jam,"The only thing wrong with jazz on TV shows back in the 50s, 60s and even the 70s was musicians and singers were limited to a few minuets and could not really ""get off"". Even so, it was good to see these past great entertainers again.I was never a great fan of Benny Goodman, but this being the only TV appearence he ever made, was worth the price."
3,Funny but One-Sided,"I thought this book was hilarious, but like all books of this sort you have to take what she says with a grain of salt."
1,Depressing book!,"I couldn't even read half of this garbage before wanting to throw it away! Vicki Iovine tells a very negative story of Motherhood, and as a first time Mom to be, I couldn't be more nervous aobut it. Thank God I read many of the other reviews which claim this book is highly exaggerated. I am going to try to return the book tomorrow. Do not waste your time here unless you want to be depressed about Motherhood."
1,The pregnancy guide is better,"While I laughed and learned all the way through her pregnancy guide, I found this book to be less entertaining and much less informative than the book on pregnancy. Basically, I see this as mindless entertainment, rather than a guide full of information that anyone would actually use to help with a new baby. I found it depressingly narrow minded, and of little practical help at all. Save your hard earned money and buy yourself and baby something you can use! I wish I'd borrowed this one from the library instead."
1,Ignorant author,"The Author of this book is ignorant. She writes in a sarcastic all-knowing tone that I found to be obnoxious. Generalizing, giving what I though to be very bad advice on some topics. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not everyone bleeds heavily after childbirth and not everyone needs stitches after childbirth. I have had two kids"
3,Fun but not realistic,"This is a fun read, but doesn't really address the depth of emotions and frustrations that new moms experience during the first year of the motherhood. It can give you a laugh and a few good tips, but don't count on it to make a major change in how you feel. --Sheryl Gurrentz, author of ""The Guilt-Free Guide to Your New Life as a Mom"""
3,Not as funny as the Pregnancy Guide,"I'm a first time mom and I read this book when my son was 3 1/2 months old. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Yes, it probably would have scared me before the baby was born, but I feel that this was her honest assessment of the first year of life. This book was NOT as good as the Pregnancy Guide, which I loved, but it provided me with some good laughs as I compared my experience with hers (and noted many similarities!)"
5,The best book for new moms,"This book was, by far, the best help of all the ""first year"" books I read. Vickie tells it like it is. She writes from experience, not medical fact. It's also very funny. Just start reading it before the baby is born because you won't have any reading time with a newborn!"
4,Honest and opinionated -- isn't that why you read Iovine?,"I've read several opinions in this space that compain that Iovine criticizes/looks down upon bottle-feeding and make snide comments about it. Quite frankly, doesn't everyone these days? I mean, if I hear one more commercial that ends with ""Breast is best, but..."" The reason I enjoyed Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy and this subsequent book is that she isn't afraid to voice opinions...and she does say, ""If you don't like my advice, don't follow it."" I wish more mothering guides took stronger stances, but then again, I'm pretty opinionated too! On a more serious note, I give thanks to Iovine for pointing out to me and my spouse that we needed to think about financial/support issues beyond college funds and life insurance -- like, what about a scenario where (God Forbid) both parents should die? Guardians? Assets? Sobering stuff but sooo important to think about. Thanks Vicki!"
1,Warning don't read if you are pregnant!,"I really enjoyed her Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnanacy, so I bought this one used from Amazon. I am 18 weeks pregnant and after reading the first chapter I was so upset I had to put the book away. All the emphasis is on the horrors of labor and recovery and none of the joys. Might be more amusing to read after I've been through it all."
2,Needs an update,"I didn't enjoy this as much as her pregnancy book. Its out of date, and some of it just rubbed me wrong. I guess I just didn't relate as much. I recently read ""Planet Parenthood"" and found it hilarious and on the money. I'd check it out instead. Overall its not bad."
5,100 percent satisfaction guaranteed razor,This is an excellent shaver kit. I also got a free promotion from Phillips to stay at any of the Inns in USA for one night free stay. This is really an excellent deal.
3,So-so,"My wife kindly bought this as a gift, but it's so-so. The shaver works as well as all other Norelcos and the cleaner does do a pretty good job (that is nice), but you're going to need to buy a lot of the cleaner fluid, which ain't chap - so do the price research before you buy."
3,She backed right out...,"I used this to take my 50lb lab mix swimming for the first time. Her other harness is a padded seatbelt kind. It was easy to put on, she didn't want to step through the front, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was, when she decided that she didn't want any part of the swimming she ducked her head and backed right out of the harness, leaving her free to explore a leash law park. Thankfully there was a woman with a sandwhich near by so she was distracted. Daisy is hardly an escape artist, so if you are looking for containment, this is NOT the harness you are looking for..."
4,Forever A Fan!!!,"Just finished Forever A Hustler's Wife, it had me laughing, crying, mad, but I really enjoy it. I was also glad to see Bambi and Lnyx make an appearance in this book because I wondered what would become of them. I really enjoyed reading it and had force my self ro put it down and times. The most devasting parts in the book to me was Nassir death and what happen to Yarrmi with one of her colleagues(npt telling). I felt Des was a smart man but he seem to overlook the small things going on around him. He look at the big picture not thedetails. Another good read by Nikkib Turner."
3,Closer fifth,"This was good, however I received (4) of the fourth season which I did not want (already have the 4th). I've done every thing you suggested and I still have four of the 4th, not opened. JW"
1,Definitely not the best of the Crystals,I am so disappointed that I paid money for this cd. I'm even more disappointed that I didn't read the reviews before buying it. I agree with the previous comment about the Michael Jackson impersonator though.
1,Do Not Buy this CD!,I was terribly disappointed when I listened to this CD! Unfortunately I did not read any of the other reviews before purchase... I cannot even bring myself to listen to it! DO NOT BUY THIS CD-- search for the real deal!!
1,Deserves Zero Stars,Beware / These are not original recordings and includes some of the original artists. Avoid!!
5,Katrina is strong,"She is often overseen, but Katrina is a strong singer and performer. All her albums are strong too. This one has the hit ""Rock'n'roll girl"", but also quite some more good songs like ""To have and to hold"" or ""Crush on you"". Katrina & the Waves are far more than a one-hit-wonder"
4,Nice Winch,"Very nice winch, but hard to install. Had to fabricate brackets. The brackets that were supplied did not work for our installation."
4,warn 26502,is a great winch but I haven't try it yet I am waiting for the connectors to hook up to the battery with quick connect
5,"Clear, focused introduction to the science of weather","Concise. Well illustrated with pictures and diagrams. Logical sequence of development of the basic ideas. All the main terms and ideas of meteorology are given good coverage, in comparison with other introductory texts. Reader level is secondary school/ adult level. 5 stars as a primer: just what one needs to start off with."
4,Beautiful pictoral essay of historic Mexican inns and hotels,"This book is good, maybe even great, but still can't compare to Melba Levick and Masako Takahashi's AWESOME ""Mexicolor"". Masako's other book, ""Mexican Tiles"" comes close, and still edges out ""Mexicasa"" a little bit as well, so when all is said and done I think I just have to chalk it up to Masako's EVIDENT love and appreciation for the unfathomable beauty of things Mexican. Melba Levick seems to me to see things more from the outside looking in, and without so much PASSION, kind of like a more disinterested spectator than a participant, but that could just be my opinion.That said, this book is is REALLY NICE. I DO really like it and I highly recommend it- especially if you already own and really liked ""Mexicolor"" and ""Mexican Tiles"". Or if you aren't so much into artesanias and Mexican interior design, but are more of an armchair traveler or are interested in actual historic hotels and haciendas."
5,IT'S JUST A DOLL!!!!!!!!,"i don't own this doll,but i've seen it in stores and like it.as my brother would say,""chillax,it's just a toy"".the crown is removeable,it comes with a cute bobble-head shiver figure,and is NOT ugly!if you're gonna complain about the little things like the smile,go ahead!act dumb!if you don't want your son/daughter to have this great toy,THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Telescope,"I ordered the blue telescope for my boyfriend. The telescope I received looks more black than blue. It's an okay product from what I can tell. He hasn't really messed with it much because the instructions were difficult to follow. It would be nice if they would have came with better instructions for a beginner. He has never owned a telescope so I had to show him how it worked. The product shipped really quickly. I had ordered something else from another seller on the same day. For the telescope, I paid for regular shipping and for the other I used express shipping. I got them the same day, so that was cool."
5,LOVE THESE SHOES!,"I freakin' love these shoes. In fact, I'm wearing them right now!! They always get compliments. Comfortable, yet sleek and stylish"
3,New Technology is a step back,"My old Norelco was better, more sturdy. This one is lighter - a plus - but being lighter seems to make it somewhat flimsier. Worse, despite the ""improved"" shaving heads with 50% more shaving surface, the shaving time takes much longer, which took me by surprise. I'm not sure why the longer shaving time, but I sense that the shavers spin slower than my old Norelco. It is quiet, which was important to me, and, ultimately, I do get a fairly close shave. The pop-up trimmer works fine and the recharging stand is convenient. I like the form-fitted case. The head opens too easily, so I'm forever cleaning up shaving stubble due to accidental openings. I cannot comment on the battery life, as it is still too new to see how economical the shaver is, however I can say that a full charge lasts me about a week (five shaves). Overall, I'm fairly satisfied, notwithstanding the above disappointments, but I cannot say I'm ""wowed"" by this new model over my older model."
5,excellent shaver,"There's not a lot to get excited about concerning shaving but thePhilips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men's Shaveris well designed and gets the job done efficiently and effectively. It provides a close shave in a minimum amount of time and does so easily and quietly.I've previous experience using a Braun shaver (about ~10 years) and after that a less expensive Norelco shaver (~5 years) with about half the shaving surface. Both were adequate, the Norelco being a definite improvement over the earlier Braun shaver. However, I purchased this one in the hopes that it would be both more efficient (length of time shave) and effective (closeness) and I have not been disappointed."
1,THIS SHAVER PULLS THE WHISKERS OUT,"I had Norelco razors before that shaved well that used the lift and cut blades. With those razors you were supposed to shave with a rotating motion. With this razor if you shave with a rotating motion it pulls the whiskers out and it is very painful. You have to shave with and up and down motion, but you have to be very careful or it will still pull the whiskers out. This Speed XL shaver is much more expensive and does a bad job.Shame on Norelco."
3,well it was my first electric shaved,I wasn't to impressed for the amount of money I spent but that is just how the cookie crumbles. It doesn't really deliver a good shave without causing you to bleed profusely from pressing it hard against your face.
3,Norelco Speed XL Men razor,"This Razor seems to work well so far (about 6 weeks) but I have the feeling that it is not very robust. I have another shaver from Philips which is 20 years old and which still works fine and it seems to be better built en rest better in the hand. The other question I have is that the motor is so low in noise level, that it is hard to know when the battery runs down."
1,Not a good buy,"I've used Norelco shavers for years. This is the worst Norelco product I have ever had. The shaver heads are not adjustable and do not provide a close shave. It seems like it lacks power. It is lightweight and easy to clean, but other than that, I couldn't recommend it. There are many shavers on the market at this price that will do a far superior job."
2,The charger stand that isn't,"One reason I bought this was to get a razor I didn't have to plug in and remember to unplug after charging. This is not a real charger stand its just an extension of the charger cord which still must be plugged in to charge and unplugged after charging. The old shaver I replaced at least had a meter on it to tell you how much time you had left, this one doesn't. Haven't noticed any difference with the 3 cutting blades per head either.Sent my old one out to have new batteries put in and will probably use the new one as a back up. On the + side it weighs less! not that it makes any difference."
2,No low battery indicator,"I purchased this shaver for my husband to replace one that was slowly dying. The biggest negative on this model is the fact that it doesn't let you know when the battery is getting low. It just stops. So my husband isn't too please about that. Fortunately he did keep his old one, so heuses it when the new one stops working in the middle of his shave."
3,Men's Shaver,Again this was a Christmas gift to my son. I hope he will enjoy theshaver. His brother has the same model shaver and he enjoys it
1,Terrible shaver...not a sharp cut; Remington R845 better.,I bought this to replace my old Remington R845 which cut very close and clean. It doesn't come close and I hated shaving with it. Waste of money. Went out and bought a R845 at Frys on sale for 20 bucks on sale and it is soooo much better. I like shaving again...
1,NOT MEANT FOR A MAN'S BEARD?,"Not sure who can get a close shave from this, but after buying this, it leaves me with a nice Don Johnson look. I may be on the thicker beard side of things, but I would expect this to atleast ""speed"" through to a nice close shave, etc. Even after putting a large amount of pressure on my skin, it appears these plastic razor blades still would not get a close shave. I have an older Norelco (metal blades) that has always done a decent job (but never as good as an old-fashioned manual razor shave), but nonetheless efficient. This newer version, however, is an extreme disappointment. I think they tried to save $ on materials, and ultimately killed the quality or usefulness."
2,Norelco SpeedXL Razors' Switches Go Bad Quickly,"I have used Norelco razors for over 40 years, and have always sworn by them. My father and both grandfathers used them--and now, my son. However, I am now looking at other brands for the first time ever. I have had three SpeedXL models in the past year--and all have had the on/off switch go bad within a few months. One of the razors was replaced by Norelco--but I am tired of the hassle of undependable razors! The last one woke us up in the middle of the night when it turned on by itself. The razors do give a very nice shave--they just do not last very long."
4,A Great Value Shaver,"Have been a Norelco user for years and each replacement shaver is usually a bit of an upgrade.This model has very nice features and is easy to use/clean. I get a great shave, in a short time. If your a Norelco man, then I recommend this shaver."
4,Good Shaver,I have had another norelco for years. The blades have worn out and buying a new razor is almost the same cost as replacing the head so I got the 8140. Noreclos still work much better than other electrics. Have not had a bad one yet.
4,Pretty good razor,"What impressed me about this shaver is how quiet it is. I retired and have slipped into twice a week shaving so I was looking for something that could cut effortlessly through the stubble quickly. It doesn't. The motor seems underpowered. After many passes there are always a few whiskers left standing that I have go back and give special attention. It also pulls more than I was expecting and leaves my face slightly irratated. I have had this shaver for 6 weeks and it is still running on the first charge, but battery life is not a big concern to me. I think that if I were to shave daily, ugh, it would perform much better."
5,The best period.,"The best Norelco ever my Dad used them I have had 3 this is the third.Rechargeable,featherweight and can be rinsed to clean.It makes shaving easy and believe it or not fun."
4,Norelco SpeedXL,The quiet shave and ease of cleaning this unit are great! The charge lasts for about two weeks during normal use and the comfort of the shave is very nice after a couple of days for your face to get used to the change from a foil razor.The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating for me is the closeness of the cut. It is not as quite close cutting as my Braun was but the other things outweigh the difference.
2,Disappointed with the 8140 XL,"Have used a 5810 XL for a few years now and been very happy with it. Unfortunately the trimmer broke, so I bought an 8140 XL.Improvements ...- Quieter- Lasts longer before it needs to be recharged- Trimmer works much better than the 5810- Nice to simply clean the heads with water, not having to pull it apart regularly for cleaning.But ...This new shaver doesn't actually shave as well as the old 5810. It's not much different on my face, but is not effective at shaving neck hairs. It takes roughly 3x as long to fully shave with the 8140 as it did with the 5810, and the 5810 gives better results. I've consulted with my barber, who has suggested a couple things, but to no avail.In my assessment, the improvements are meaningless if it doesn't shave well. Hence my low rating of this shaver."
1,Rash and Scrapes,I have been using Norelco razor's for years. This is not one of my favorites. It seems more irritating than the older modles. I tried shaving my bicept area and received a rather severe shaving rash and it actually scraped the tender skin on my inner bicept. I also notice that it is harder on the skin on my face and neck than my previous razor (a Norelco modle 5822XL). I think the 8140XL shaves closer but it too irritating. I have been using it for one month. Maybe I will get used to it
2,Short term battery life,"I purchased this razor in September of 2005. In December of 2005 the blades were so dull, that it took forever to shave, and I certainly don't have a heavy beard. I am very disappointed with the short life of the blades. At this rate it would cost me $ 120.00 a year for blades. I am sorry to say that I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it."
1,Dogman,"This razor is over priced and a very poor performer. It has very little power, shaving is more of a task than it should be. I have a 20 yr old Norelco that gives a much better shave."
2,Not for me,"I had an old Norelco that worked pretty well, but I broke it somehow...I ordered the 8140XL as a replacement and I was not satisfied. It left stray hairs all over my face which looked terrible. I had to use the Norelco follwed up by a mach3 everytime that I shaved to the point where I returned thr item. I have a very tough beard, but I find that I get somewhat better results from my brothers electric Braun than I did with this Norelco."
4,Worth the price.,"It's a little bit.. erhm.. 'frail'. The arm's are not too steady, no matter where you put them. Otherwise it works quite well."
3,not so good fitness elliptical,i brought this confidence fitness 2-in-1 back in march i been using it alot and if you used it for a long period of time it makes alot of noise and last week i used it and the chain came off the bike and it is hard to put the chain back on. and when i was using it last week one day it was hard to push i had to dial on very easy to move so i had to get off and push with my hands to get it going again.
5,Great price,"Great product with a great price sticker. I always make sure I review the products that I buy. However, it is a pain to have to do these twice. I reviewed this product through my email and I again have to do it through my Amazon account. Lets hope this is the last time I have to rate this product!!"
3,"good product with cheap parts , bad shipping",the item came with little or no care given to the package. several parts that where plastic were broken and not repairable. no point to return since it would probaly come back in worse condition. but it does work and my wife is using it now to work out. be sure not to use fed ex to ship your item the delivery happened while i was not present but my mother in law said the guy dropped the package by the door and ran
1,zero stars for this product,"Finally, after about a year and a half, I moved this product into a corner of the basement to be thrown out. It started working well, but after a few months a grinding noise started, and the motion was very erratic. I had to take the machine apart and tighten screws. That lasted about a month, then I had to repeat the process. I never received a guarenntee on the product of any kind, and wrote the company about it. They said they had it on file, but I never saw it. Anyway, I kept fiddling with it over and over. For a year and a half the product was the worst investment I ever made. I would NEVER recommend this to any exercise enthusisat. Spend more money on a better product."
3,Good for Beginners,"The machine is designed for beginners who just want to make between 30-60 minutes daily exercise (such as regular exercise routine). If you can combine between elliptical and exercise bike, you can get results (although minimal). I think the price is according to the product. The plastic pedals are weak and it can break easily, I prefer metal pedals. I agree with the comment of another user when he mentions that cycling is quite difficult because the seat is so far from the handles. Regarding the shipping was super fast and very easy assembly (I could do alone)."
5,Lube That Shredder,These lubricant sheets ar so easy to use. They really work and the shredder runs so much quieter now. They were shipped to me very quickly. Easy-to-follow instructions.
1,Piece of Junk,"This flat panel television is a poorly made piece of junk. I purchased two of them from Amazon and the first one broke before it was ever delivered to my house and the second one never worked even after it was serviced by an authorized technician. Samsung customer service said that this happens sometimes in shipment but I personally watched the technician change out the electronic boards (on the second set) and I can tell you that it is not the quality of workmanship that one would expect for the price. These large TVs don't ship well when they are assembled with a cheaply made support structure like the Samsung. I.e., thin plastic housing. The box it came in was better made."
2,BEST TV EVER UNTIL IT DIED,"Owned 4665 for a blissful tv/movie watching week before it simply turned off and wouldn't ever turn back on (no click, no nothing when I try to turn tv on.) It lasted one week...but what a week it was...this tv is unbelieveably beautiful. Had trouble with the HDMI, video worked but no audio through hdmi (isn't it supposed to carry audio?) Also the Just Scan was disappointing as tv only allowed me to use it when watching HDTV channels (even though my dvd player was upscaling my dvd's to 1080I def. with a hdmi cable.) I assume it would work with blu-ray and hddvd, but you can't use Just Scan whenever you want. Samsung, you have broken my heart...lucky for you it happened within the 30 day return period. Don't let it happen again."
1,Do your research,"I purchase 2 of the LNT4665,my sister purchased 1 as well. The picture quality is awesume. After a year all but one of the tv's began to malfunction. The switch continues to make a clicking noise and never comes on. You will not be able to turn the clicking off with the remote your will need to unplug. Samsung is aware and has not address the issue. Please research - Complaints as well."
1,No Picture after only 18 months !,"I purchased a Samsung LN-T4665 from Amazon. After only 18 months of purchase, the TV has stopped working - NO picture. Samsung customer service says they cannot do anything since it is outside the warranty period. Repair estimate (from a Samsung authorized technician) is more than the cost of a new set.There are numerous posts regarding the same issue for Samsung LCD TVs - on Amazon and other websites (see links below).[...]It is unfortunate that Samsung is not doing anything to address this recurring issue. My advice - stay away from Samsung LCD TVs."
1,Doesn't Last,"I bought this t.v. a year and a half ago in January 2007. Yesterday, my husband and I noticed a spot a quarter of an inch wide where there is no picture. It's very annoying and we're upset that it got this flaw all of a sudden. We are going to try to see if there is anyway to get it fixed or if we are out fourteen hundred and fifty smackers. We can't watch a program without looking at the spot, so we need a new t.v. If anyone has a suggestion, please help."
1,Bummer,"I've had this TV for 2 years now, and 1 year 1 month into it (right after the warrantee expired) It started to turn black whenever there was high humidity... After some googling, I found that this is actually a common problem with Samsung TV's, yet Samsung has done nothing to address the issue...Other than the occasional hours where the TV just doesn't work, the TV is actually great quality picture and features. To bad this will most likely be my last Samsung TV as other models have the same problem and Samsung has been slow to respond to it."
1,Disappointed and Mad,I thought I was buying the best TV for the money. Little did I know that Direct TV and Samsung have compatability issues with the new 1.3 HDMI format. I can't use the HDMI cable (even the $130 Monster Cable) with my set. I have had Samsung out to look at the TV and they have replaced some internal board - so great my brand new TV has already been taken apart and put back together. I have had Direct TV out and all they can say is that some TV brands can't use the HDMI cables and mus use components - sounds like a pile of **** to me. If I knew these issues I would not have bought the newer model Samsung. I am truely disappointed.
1,Capacitors issue,"The product has a capcitor issue, that will come up right after the warranty expires, once you call for support, they aknowledge an issue on the capacitor and will tell you that your TV was produced on the only day that the batch was good, so SAMSUNG will not honor any warranty or deffects, be prepare to pay a lot of money on repairs after the second year, or plan to buy a brand new one after 2 years"
2,Samsung LNT4665F,"This LCD TV has beautiful color and contrast ratio.However, it has a hidden problem which Samsung refuse to admit "" A BAD POWER SUPPLY/BAD CAPACITOR'S "" your TV will not last past 2-3 years and the TV goes out and please this can be verified on the internet and see the large amount of thesame issue other people have with Samsung TV's and the hell they go through to get it fixed.Its a bad TV stay away from Samsung TV's they last for just a couple of years, now am back to using my 1999 Sony TV .Samsung TV's ARE NOT BUILT TO LAST period !My Samsung LNT4665F is idle with a bad power supply.. and please review Samsung TV's on the internet and read customer complaints before buying.I will never buy any Samsung product "" NEVER.My suggestion is I will not recommend SAMSUNG TV."
2,SAME PROBLEM! GET WITH IT SAMSUNG!,"I purchased this set in August of 08, as a birthday gift for my husband. It arrived with no problem- very nice picture quality, everything seemed wonderful. Then a year later, right after the warranty expired (coincidence?)Black screen when turned on- sound but no picture...hmmm starting to sound familiar? Now sometimes it takes an hour for the picture to pop on- we even had Direct TV come out and give us a new HD receiver, because we thought that might be the problem. Nope. it's the piece of junk TV that I paid $2200 for.. Never again Samsung! Buyer beware!"
1,Samsung Finally Lost Me,"I, like so many others enjoyed this tv for several years. Then the problems began. Little did I know there was a class action suit to force Samsung to deal with a big problem. I made it by 2 days, thanks to a neighbor. To their credit, a repairman was sent out within a week, and after 2 calls, the problem was fixed. That was a few months ago. Now, when we turn the tv on, we get a picture for a second, then it's gone. I tried researching this on the Samsung web site among others, without a lot of luck. Five years for a tv that cost 2 grand?I don't have the patience, or tech to try to fix the problem. Samsung got cheap, just like Toyota did, tried to hide it, and have lost tens of thousands of customers. They are big and probably don't care. Well, good luck with that approach. Remember one person can make a difference."
2,Not the razor for me,"I was trying to make the shift from a razor blade to an electric shaver and found that this shaver did not provide the close shave I was looking for. It also was taking me much longer to shave because I had to continually go over the same area in order for it to finally get all the hairs. In the end, after using it for 5 weeks, I took advantage of the 60 day return policy and returned the shaver. I am back to my razor blade. I still hate shaving."
3,Rawlings Heart of the Hide 1st base mitt,"The only reason I gave this 3 stars was because of the break in period. According to Rawlings info on this glove, it should have been much easier to break in than it really was. After oiling and conditioning the glove, many weeks of using it for practice at the field and also playing pitch at home, it still was extremely stiff. Each night I would condition it and place a ball in the pocket and tie it up. Finally after about 3 months of this, it was loose enough to confidently play a real game with it. Once it was loose, it performed as expected. Just be prepared to have an extended break in period. Well worth it after broken in."
1,disappointed,I bought this Delta Pressure balanced Shower 2 months ago for my new addition. It was just installed and found out the diverter valve is no good. I am very disappointed since I now have to find a new valve myself.
2,bird house,"My son received this kit for christmas. He had a blast painting and putting it together all by himself. We hung it up outside with the hope a bird would nest in the house. After 2 days of rain I found it on the ground in pieces. The wood soaked up the rain and split in half on each side. It broke my sons heart to see his hard work ruined. With something that has the Home Depot name on it, I would think it would be better quality. I wouldn't recommend any Home Depot project that is for real use. Sincerely, Mrs. Witt"
4,A Study Bible to meet any need,"The list of comtibutors is impressive and represent scholars of diverse faiths. The commentaries provide a base for a better understanding of the text. I have several Study Bibles and find this one thorough, verse to verse. The Guides for Interpretation are also helpful. I was familiar with the RSV twelve volumn set and therefore welcomed this one volumn book. I am not disappointed. I lead adult study and am a self-taught scholar. I can recommend it for the average student."
5,Study Bible,"I haven't had a chance to really delve into the Study Bible yet, but what I have checked coincides withmy interpretation of the Bible."
4,Misleading?,"This is promoted as a ""Box Set"" which would indicated more than one item. The only item is the bible, but it does come in a box.New Interpreters Study Bible: New Revised Standard Version With the Apocrypha, Black Genuine Leather"
4,The Unbiased Truth,"I have many versions of the Bible, and this is by far my very favorite. Finally, a Bible with accurate notes and tips for interpretation. I always felt like other Bibles were biased by one way of thinking or believing when I read the comments. But knowing the hardwork that 65 scholars put into making this Bible is very helpful as I study and try to understand the history, context, people, culture and so many other things that need to be understood when reading the Bible. I have not read the apocrypha yet, but I was pleased to see it was also included in this version. For those of you who really want to understand what the Bible means, read this one! I highly recommend it."
3,Paperback is hard,"I suggest you spring for the hard cover, as the paperback cover is hard to hold open and read from if it is not placed on something. Also, something with this many pages is readlly hard to keep open to the first or last few pages without that hard back holding it open."
1,do not become it. i was lost,"i am very sorry, but like always with amazon i bought, paid the cd. but i did not become it. i was lost again, like all yours products. from argentina. luis piazzini"
1,"Not ""RED"" at all, and broke right away.","My husband bought us this same model and color after our coffee maker of 12 years died. We were excited to have found it because based on the picture on the box and it stated its color as red, we asumed it would match our other appliances, stand mixer, blender, toaster etc...Boy were we disapointed when we took it out of the box, it was BURGUNDY!!! The box shows a true RED color, but whats inside is totaly different. It made great coffee and its features were a big plus. Unfortunatley, I think our negative vibe killed it cuz it only lasted about a week then it stoped working. I exchanged it for a black one for now. And....I definatly think Mr Coffee should update their packaging to say BURGUNDY not RED."
2,Not the best Uniden phone,"We are very happy with our TRU446 phones by Uniden and wanted a third ""cheaper"" phone just to have around, so we went with Uniden again. The EXI44246C model has terrible range, static when even right next to the base. The volume does not seem to be loud enough - at maximum volume, it sounds more like low volume.I do like that the vm indicator is on the base instead of the handset, since we hardly ever replace our phones on the bases, and don't think to look for the handsets to see if there is a vm. This particular base is right by our door so we know right away if there is a vm.I only paid about $20 for this phone, but I'm going to try to return it because it doesn't even seem to be worth that much."
1,Bad book,This book did not make sense and the writer of this book mixed in so many different things from different religions. It is not worth wasting your time on a book like this. I would not recommend this to anyone.Only a slave or follower should read this.
2,Ok...but not great...,"I don't know if it's the poor organization or formatting in this book that is worse. First, it's very hard to find the main headings on any given page. Next, there is a ""listing"" at the back that most people will think is an index (I did anyway), and it's really not. For example, in this section at the back, you don't find the word, ""Wedding."" However, if you go to the ""W"" section of the book contents, there is a heading for Wedding. So far, of the 20 or so dreams we've looked up, we've only been able to find 2 that we could interpret. I have had much better luck using online dream interpretation software. I would not buy this book. Good thing I got it as a gift."
2,it only covers the basics,I find it very difficult to be satisfied with the short interpretations given in this book...many symbols seem to be missing...
4,20th Century Fox Studio Classic,"I remember watching these as a kid growing up. I saw the Bible in Lincoln, NE at a Drive-In Theater. I didn't see The Agony and the Ecstasy that I recall. I do know that I enjoyed them all so much that I had to take the opportunity to own them so I could watch them whenever I want to. My only disappointment is that I seem to remember them showing 2 hours of The Bible then having an intermission before showing another 2 hours. This copy was less than 3 hours and it seemed to me there was a lot left out. Over all, however, if you've never seen these movies, you'll be very happy with them.[...]"
5,If You Know Someone That Wants A Cow...,"...like my nephew did, this is an awesome choice for a BIG stuffed animal. Very well made, very realistic (did I mention it is BIG?), with a lot of personality. Delivery was speedy.The cow spent a couple of days in our kitchen before being mailed on to my nephew, and my husband had a jolt every time he walked into the room. (""There's a cow in the kitchen!"")"

2,"I finished this series, but only out of morbid curiosity.","There is little I can add to the discussion of this series. The reviews seem to fall into two lines--people who have read good science fiction, and people who haven't. The latter think this is the greatest series ever written. It does start out fairly promising, and the first few books are quite entertaining, but it seems that Mr. Hubbard contrived the next 5 or 6 books without any real conception of what they were for; he merely wanted to get up to 9 and 10 before wrapping up the story. The intervening volumes wander around aimlessly, adding little in the way of intelligible development. If writers are going to write a 10 book series, please include enough plot for 10 books. This story could have been written in 3 books, and I probably would reread it. As it stands, I'm glad I only bought the first 3 before heading to the library; I don't have room on my shelf for filler."
4,Review of the Audio Book Version - Rating 4.5,1) Pro: Highest production audio book I've read to date. Multiple cast members playing their identified roles. Nice change from having one actor try and read for every part. This felt like it was an actual play.2) Pro: Satirical (sp?) humor and engaging characters3) Pro: I had no idea what to expect next and the first person point of view was excellent for this story4) Con: Ends with minimal number of things resolved
1,"Sammy ""THE RAT""Gravano","""NO"" I did not buy the dvd because it talks about a RAT FACED MORON who became a Rat for the F.B.I because he was to WEAK!!! to due time then again he and his family moved to Arizona and got busted in a drug ring just goes to show you if you are a Gravano Rat it will come back to bite you which now That Rat Faced Gravano is getting it the hard way:)"
5,Great songs,"I listen to this CD over and over again, just love it. Her songs make so much sence to me and remind me of my time back home in Germany."
4,Tennessee Williams' plays as movies,"Each of the plays of Tennessee Williams that has been rended as a movie is worth watching. The rawness of emotions, the actors and the direction all make these movies immensely watchable."
2,boring.,Although the acting was good the stories were a bit boring and lengthy. I'm sorry to say they did not hold up very well to the test of time. Perhaps if I were a decade or so older I might have appreciated them more. I do not reccomend it at any price.
4,Good Elliptical Machine for Price,"Good exercise machine for price paid. After doing extensive research and reading reviews I decided to purchase this product over other more expensive exercise machines. The machine was not very difficult to assemble. It took less than 1 hour and was pretty easy to figure out how the parts went together. It provides a good workout for the legs and arms. The machine does make you feel like you are leaning forward a little unless you squat slightly which makes the workout more intense. No problems with the machine falling apart.Overall, a good exercise machine for the price paid. Maybe not a $500 machine quality, but did not cost $500 either. I am happy with the machine, and it does what I expected."
1,Not good!,I have been disapointed with this machine from the get go! Things have been breaking from the first week. Just because you do not have the money to buy high-end does not mean you should get screwed!!!!!!!!!! I would not recomend this machine. Spend a little more for one you won't have to replace in six weeks.
4,Great value bad packaging,"This machine works really well, its not quite an elliptical machine it feels more like standing up on a bike and riding only with a bigger pedal stroke and you can use your arms to help out. It feels solid enough consider the cost and size. The main complaint is the packaging. The bolts weren't in a plastic bag rather they were look like they were just tossed in the box before shipping. After assembly one of the front screw that holds the legs in place was missing and I searched everywhere. Out of a hunch I opened the plastic casing and found the screw sitting inside, it must of slipped inside the open slot in front. Had they put ALL the bolts in some kind of bag this wouldn't of happened. Also the machine leans forward to much so I would strongly recommend putting a 2x4 wood piece of a dictionary under the front so it feels more comfortable. For the money this is a good value and clearly it says in the instructions to check the bolts and tighten as needed."
4,excellent value for the price,"Since it arrived has been used daily with no issues.Make sure to keep a lube material handy, not something like WD40, something with a little viscosity. I've added a little about once a week to keep the squeak down and it works fine.The computer is simple but does exactly what it says it will."
4,I love this trainer,"This product is easy to assemble, and even eaiser to use. It is low impact on your joints, yet you get the same great work out as running, I felt it working just about evey muscle in my body. I highly recommend this product to stay in shape, or to help you lose weight."
5,"Good, romantic, historical fiction","A mind-awakening story of a young man who from birth refuses to allow his soul to be tarnished by conformism, by submission to others, or by the privileges of nobility. One admires his energy and industry, marvels at his precociousness, feels the passion for his betrothed, and cheers for his integrity. Hugo might have written of Hugh Kenrick, ""Such men exist!"" It is a powerful example of the sort of individual it takes to achieve greatness, independence, and moral certainty by reason. I heartily recommend this book (and the previous volume of the set) to mature young readers currently studying the history of pre-revolutionary America and the heroes who founded a nation."
1,"Received it yesterday, returning it today","Received it yesterday, returning it today... Followed the instructions exactly, but it would not connect by cable to my router, so I tried it wireless, it connected. After it connected, it took quite a while until it saw the music server. When it lost connection (frequently) it would again take forever (in excess of 10 minutes) until it again saw the music server...Played about 3 songs before it crashed and I had to unplug it to recover. The remote was awful- it took several pushes on a button until the unit actually responded. The unit itself was sluggish in responding, even to the buttons on the unit itself... The sound quality was less than impressive using the supplied speakers.Based on my past experience with Linksys tech support (tried the 802.11b print server unsuccessfully), I did not bother to call them this time.Overall, I am very disappointed in this unit and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Cool look just doesnt work!,Music Match is very slow in loading and hangs by every startup.The player doesnt stream music well at all no matter what bitrate or firmware version.Once you go into a sub menu you must go all the way the the first menu to get out.Volume on the included speakers is horrible.I just bought the entire Rockford Fosgate Package AWESOME!
2,Good idea but not quite there yet,"My main complain is what appears to be buggy firmware. The box would loose connectivity to media server once in a while (I have it connected to LAN directly). I would start displaing ""No Media Server"" message (the box would continue to be visible on the network however). Once that happens - the only remedy is to turn power off and unplug the power cable and then power it back up.The other problem is that menu navigation is really slow, much below acceptable level of comfort.On a minor note - built-in speakers are of really poor quality for what one may expect to get for the price."
4,"Not Perfect, but works well (on linux to boot)","I bought this not having super high expectations after reading all the comments. That said, I think it was a good purchase.I run it on my linux system (Linspire 5.0 using MP3beamer software) to listen to my mp3 collection and playlists.It set up easily (I'm techie enough) with MAC address filtering and 128 WEP encryption.The interface (screen) is not much different from the SMC wireless media adapter I have, but the remote is much better and the buttons on the unit are handy.The speakers are only good enough for a small room (I use mine in the bedroom)I don't use internet radio really, so no comment on that feature.- Cheers"
4,The Nordstrom Way Review,"Reading the Nordstrom Way has made me highly respect the store itself. It was very refreshing to read a book about a company that places so much emphasis on customer service. After reading the book, I was convinced that Nordstrom truly values their customers above all else, unlike many retail stores today. I thought that the author did a very good job in both retelling the history of Nordstrom and conveying their way of conducting business. Through telling the story of the Nordstrom family, giving examples of good customer service, and sharing personal stories of Nordstrom employees, the author does an excellent job of helping the reader understand what Nordstrom is all about. I would recommend this book to anybody interested in learning about how to run such a successful business as Nordstrom has done and will continue to do for years to come."
2,Nice pendant but weak chain.,"The pendant is quite beautiful, but the chain broke within a week. Easy enough to replace, but that shouldn't happen."
5,beautiful,I got this necklace for my girlfriend - she absolutely loves it and gets comments on it all the time.
5,Beautiful and Affordable,"I received this necklace off of my Amazon wishlist last year for Christmas, and it is one of my favorite pieces of jewelry. It's very versatile - I can dress up or down with it and wear it to work or on an evening out. The flower is very delicate and is very lightweight, the perfect size. I have had no trouble with the chain on mine - I was sent one with an extender, and I actually prefer it because I like being able to adjust it to my blouse or dress neckline."
3,best on dog hair,"This vacuum does what it's supposed to do. It actually cleans dirt and dog hair out of the carpets. The most amazing thing is that the fifty foot cord weighs more than the unit itself so that pushing it around is exceedingly less of a strain. Afterall who wants to do their exercise pushing and pulling some heavy vacuum cleaner around the house. As for all the attachments, we still have the old beasts to place where the attachments are needed and not need to drag a beater bar with them."
3,Not what I expected....,"I normally wear Laura Mercier Foundation Powder no.7 but I usually buy it at Sephora. However,the one got from Amazon did not apply as smoothly. It was quite hard to get the product on the sponge. The package also looked a bit different. Will be purchasing this from the store from now on."

5,Wonderful,"I purchased this oil filter wrench when I couldn't remove a filter that had been put on by a mechanic with an end-cap wrench that I had used for 5 years. With this wrench, a 24"" breaker bar, and about 30 seconds of time - I was able to remove the filter.As another reviewer said, it doesn't lock onto the handle; but, that's a minor issue compared to it's ability to bite into and remove an amazingly stubborn oil filter."
3,requires a lot of room to work,"i ended up using a strap wrench as I didn't have enough room to work the filter off with this tool. It also damages the filter, so you don't really get a second chance with another tool."
4,Almost perfect,"Ladies of the road:Disc 1:perfect.Wonderful songs,nice sound quality.Disc 2:that Jam session could be terrific.But the quality sound is poor."
2,I've had it for less than a month and it's broken,"I bought this bike with the hope of using it as an easy way to get some exercise into my hectic schedule. However today, after using it on the second setting everyday for the past 15 days, it started making a strange grinding noise. At this point I can no longer push the peddles. I did not expect this kind of performance based on the other reviews. Up until today it was a great bike and I am very disappointed that I can't use it anymore."
1,Piece of Crap and POOR Customer Service,"The product came with an imcomplete seat assembly: what good is an exercise bike w/o a seat? Both Amazon and Golf Outlets were completely unresponsive to my queries until I contacted the BBB and several complaint blog sites. Parenthetically: Amazon has gotten too big. It takes an act of Congress to actually put in a complaint which by and large gets ignored. I ended up spending more to have a seat assembly fabricated than the bike cost and I got nothing from either Amazon or Golf Outlets. Don't buy anything on Amazon's site with the exception of books, which they do a good job with. Again, the bike was worthless until I spent over $150 to have a seat fabricated; if you want to spend the extra money then buy this crappy product. And, again, Amazon has grown too large; they are cumbersome and unresponsive. Go to Ebay, etc. Tom Morring"
2,Cheaply Made,"I was really excited about this bike. It was easy to put together, and seems to do okay, other than the fact that the calorie counter monitor falls off easily, and within ten minutes of using it, it fell off and the wires came completely out. It had been super glued. Now I have no way of counting calories/distance/etc. Buy a more expensive one."
4,Great home bike for price!,I asked for this bike for Christmas even though there were some mixed reviews. It was put together in about a half hour and by 10pm Christmas night I had rode over 13 miles. Very pleased with the size of this bike (living in a condo). I was mainly looking for a bike to use at home on those very busy days I knew I wouldn't get to the gym or on a cold or rainy day when I don't feel like leaving for the gym. I'm 5'10 and work out on a regular basis and I found this bike suitable for home use. Especially for the cost!
1,disappointed,"I am seriously disappointed with this bike which I purchased through Amazon At first it worked fine (about two weeks). Then it began making a rather dreadful grinding noise with intermittent cracking sounds. Eventually it stopped working altogether.I was frustrated by the lack of information on the internet. Apparently the manufacturer does not have a website. Because the bike worked for awhile, I exceeded the thirty day return period. I tried to return it through UPS, but the cost of returning it was prohibitive."
1,Quality has gone down hill. Do not buy!,"I bought one of these bikes 5 years ago and had great experience with it. I gave it to my girlfriend a few months ago and bought a new one for myself. It was not the same!! First the tension on it was very hard! I liked to ride my old bike on higher tension. I could only ride this one on the lowest settings! Second, it was much louder! Finally, just a week ago, there was a grinding, grating sound causing uneven tension (from hard to harder). Felt like something broke.The bike is essentially unusable at this point. I only had it for a few months, riding 3-4 times a week. I contacted the company with my problem and received no response.Do not buy this bike, unless you find an older used one!"
4,Moderate workout with simple assembly,"This bike was very easy to put together. I am a 24 year old girl with experience in assembling home furniture and I put this together in one hour. Like others have mentioned, the bike seat is a little hard so I would recommend a seat cover, but make sure to get one that is wide enough (I did not, but still managed to get mine to work by cutting and altering it a bit). So far the digital display has worked awesome, and the calorie counter is dead on. I think this is great for the price and hope that it lasts for a while. Also, I live in a small NY apartment and this is a little awkward and bigger than I imagined, but still semi fits in a closet. Plan on updating if I have any trouble. Overall, I would give this bike a B+."
4,"Nice bike, hard seat","Everything I wanted in a folding bike. I need to exercise my knee this bike does the job. The price was nice. The seat is why I gave the bike 4 stars, it is uncomfortable to sit for long time."
4,Compact exercise bike,I was looking for a small exercise bike. This one is perfect! Nice and quiet. When not using I can roll right into the closet.
1,Broke after 4 months of light use.,"Terrible product. The magnetic resistance mechanism froze up and stopped moving suddenly after four months of use between the easiest and second-easiest levels. I ignored the negative reviews when I bought it, hoping I would get one of the better ones since it appeared ideal for small-space living, but now I am out 139.99 since it's too late to return this defective bike. I don't usually write reviews but this bike is so bad that I need to warn any prospective purchaser: stay away."
5,great bike,"I am enjoying this bike a great deal. It doesn't take up too much room, although the ""stow away"" aspect of it was not as impressive as I was hoping--when you fold it up, you save maybe 1 foot of room. But that's okay because it's still a pretty skinny device. I keep it in the closet and roll it out every day--I wouldn't say it's light (it's about 40 lbs) but it's not hard to maneuver. Assembly was not that difficult. All in all, a great bike for getting some exercise while doing other things (I watch TV, read, or play a game on my Nintendo DS)."
2,Not very happy.,I bought this bike because it was handy and portable and didn't take up much space. I got it and was initially very happy. It was light and easily stowed in what little space I have. It was easy to put together and worked well for the first two days. Then it broke. The bracket holding the magnets from the wheel gave and now I cannot pedal without extreme difficulty and a terrible grinding noise. The company that sold it gave me a full refund without any fuss. It seems like a decent product and I hope that I just got a rare bum unit.
1,Lasted one month!,"I really liked this bike for the first 3 weeks, than week 4 the pedals and gears locked up. This could be such a good product as it is light weight, quiet and affordable. Now I have a fitness bike in my living room that I cant even pedal! It's just so frustrating!**Update*** December 7, 2011Company sent me a new bike to replace the prior bike. This bike lasted 4 months and again the gears locked up. Terrible!"
1,Fell apart after 2 months,"Not worth the money. Would recommend buy a better made product than this one. Noise started in gear box. Then weeks later they pedals locked up. Being a bike mechanic in my past I thought I would be able to fix it. No way. Nothing is replaceable and had to throw in garbage.Love the ""X"" design but the quality of this brand is low."
2,missing parts,"The bike is okay, but they didn't send me all the parts. I am missing screws and washers. Even the items that were supposed to be attached to the seat are missing. I am not too happy, but I think it will be an okay bike after I purchase the items that were supposed to be included originally!"
1,Confidence Fitness Space - broke after being used 3 times!,"I was very happy about getting my confidence fitness bike, got it on time but took approximately two months to use it for the first time. Anyway, the bike is not working anymore and I used it three times for about 45 minutes/each! I spent a $100.00 on it and I cannot even return it! I missed the return window because I didn't use it right away. I don't recommend this product at all."
5,Great exercise bike,"I really didn't think that this bike was going to be sturdy enough to work out on. I was so wrong this is a great bike, lite weight yet sturdy. I am using it every other day for about 35 minutes on level 4. I have already lost 7 lbs. I told my sister about it and she is getting one too! Very easy to assemble... you won't believe how small it is great for any space."
2,Missing parts,"The bike came missing 3 washers and one battery (battery is no big deal.) I hope I can buy the 3 missing washers--as of now I cannot assemble the seat. Also, I cannot open the battery compartment: it seems stuck. Otherwise I have assembled the bike. I will add to this review if I can solve the probems and try out the bike (which I hope I can do), or if it turns out I cannot solve the problems. Right now, the jury is out."
1,Don't Buy This,"This is a really poorly made product. It had so much potential, I bought it as a gift for someone, but it really turned out to be very pathetic. Save your money, you'll be glad you bought something else instead."
1,A Scam - [...],"Clearly written to make a quick buck, this 'article' is really a 2-3page pamphlet that has been scrapped together and offers readers no insight into cross-cultural leadership, or really any value. [...]"
2,Lantern Painting,"I bought this for my granddaughter to paint for her mom and for her aunt for Mother's Day. It comes with two lanterns to paint so it was the perfect idea for her gift to them. Unfortunately, it was missing the metal pieces that hold the lantern in the open position and they don't work without it. I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could get the metal piece since it wasn't worth the money to return it. I wouldn't buy it on-line again; it's better to make sure the whole kit is there.8/27/2011 - Never heard a word back from the manufacturer so they've permanently lost a customer for their products!"
1,Ink is not washable - beware!,"Not sure what kind of company would produce a toy for young children that includes non-washable ink, but parents should beware. Soap and water will not easily remove this ink. It seems similar to the ink in a Sharpie pen."
2,St. Louis deserves better,"Disappointingly mediocre. St. Louis deserves to be spotlighted much better than this. I read an interview with the authors, in which they claim that Gil & Claire are supposed to be modeled after Nick and Nora Charles of the classic Thin Man film series. Well, they're not even close. The dialogue is not terribly clever and the characters aren't very interesting. Plus halfway through the murderer is revealed and the book muddles itself into a standard woman-in-jeopardy climax. If not for the frequent and accurate descriptions of St. Louis and its neighborhoods I'm not sure I would have finished this slight mystery."
4,Great Pictures I just wish the text was in english,"The pictures are great and from what I could translate so is the text. So if the publisher is reading this, how about an English translation. There is too little written on BASE.Since I first did this review an English copy has been publishedIf you BASE or ever thought about it get this bookAlso look for ""Ground Rush"" in used book stores between the two there is good information on BASERating has been raised to 4 stars but this is for the English edition"
2,"Great concept - lousy execution, horrible characters","This book has such a great concept, but the way the author presented his characters is so bad. The writing itself is beyond criticism: no one talks or acts as stupidly as the characters in this book. This is a waste of time, a waste of a great idea, a waste of writing. 2 stars go only towards the concept, nothing else. This is a lousy author."
4,The complete picture on Water Quality Monitoring,"Everybody is talking about water quality and water resource monitoring but action is harder to find...This book, edited by Bartram and Ballance, brings together key people from around the globe to present the complete, practical picture on water quality monitoring for freshwaters. The list of affiliations reads like a who's who in water management.The book covers the spectrum of water quality monitoring, from selection of sites, parameters and frequency of sampling through to analysis of samples and reporting of information. On the way, the contributors detail field techniques, personnel management, quality assurance as well as the essential components of physical, chemical, microbiological, biological, hydrological and sediment analyses. Reference to further literature is also provided.Importantly, this book provides a global perspective on the monitoring and management of a global resource.Practical and useful!"
3,Rather disappointing,"When I read the review of this record in ""Gramophone"" I was interested and excited. Wow! ""Gilded"" Goldbergs! Must be something like Liszt's Bach transcriptions times two, right? Unfortunately, wrong. What arrived was a very modern composition indeed, one at times of astonishing ugliness. This is a very 20th century composition, more chromed or aluminum Goldbergs than gilded. It's Bach as seen through Schoenberg, not Liszt or Busoni. I admit I'm guilty of bringing preconceptions to a work of art, but I was disappointed with this composition. In any case, this is not a work to which I'll return with much eagerness. Maybe other listeners can convince me to try again."
3,Crystal Owl Pin,We loved the look of this pin. However we expected a larger pin. The recipient of the gift was delighted.
4,Norelco heads are what they say they are,I ordered replacement heads for my husband's shaver and they are exactly what they said they were. He now gets a much closer shave and it doesn't take him 15 minutes to shave. Thanks.
5,lovely,That is right! yes i think sooooo! makes me as happy as I can be while writing this here review that seems too long.
3,Norelco Shaver Replacement Heads,"Unfortunately, I have been unable to use the heads since they turned out not be the correct model for my shaver. I thought I was careful in my selection, but found out I was wrong. Because I have opened the package I did not feel it was appropriate to return or exchange them."
3,"Service was great, but product is poor",The provider did a great job shipping the shaving head and the price was far below the cost in the stores. The shaver is okay but it does not cut as close as some previous electric shavers that I have had from Norelco.The shaving head is the same as the original head that comes with the razor.
5,"Happy with blades, great design","I've used many razor types over the year from regular blades to electric. Most recently, I'm fond of Norelco electric razors, and these replacement heads are just great.These replacement heads are easy to install and clean, and they do a find job of shaving for me. I'm a daily shaver, and these seem to last me about one year, before it feels like the razor is pulling more than slicing. I'd buy this again and again, works great and feels like a mid-life extender for my razor."
4,Replacement Heads,Amazon was great. My parents were not able to find the replacement heads but I found them in a few minutes on Amazon and then they were delivered a few days later. This was great.
5,Really Smooth,I ordered these for my guy when he dropped his brand new razor on the floor and bent a head. The razor and blades are really quiet and give him a really smooth face. I highly reccommend these.
1,not impressed,"Bought these for my 1+ year old razor. When new, you could hardly feel the razor on your face as it glided over and removed hair rapidly. Smoothest shave ever! I was expecting a return to this, but the new blades were not much better than the ones that I disposed of. I thought that buy buying from the manufacturer I would be getting a quality replacement, but I was wrong."
5,smooth again,This was a well needed purchase . It had been 6 yrs since I bought my electric razor . To say the least my blades were dull as a butter knife . I could not believe the difference the new blades made! I am back to being smooth again ! I recommend you don't wait as long as I did . I won't either next time !
5,Its like having a new razor again,Not a lot to say about them. If your razor isn't shaving as well as it used to it might be time for it. Very easy installation. I always use mine as long as possible and had the razor for 2 years before replacing them so it was quite an improvement. Just make sure you get the ones for your razor!
3,Does the job but still produce a mediocre shave,It does the job as replacement heads but my shave didn't improve much since I swapped them. Not sure if its the shaver or the heads.
4,Different package.,Good product. The only difference is the package received from the one in the picture...
1,"""Lift and rip out technology""","They should state the real feature of the 2 blade system as ""The first blade lifts up the hair, and the second blade rips out the hair""I was bought the shaver as a gift from costco, from day 1 it has been painful. It causes irritation and ingrown hairs, and about once a week I raise my arm preparing to throw it at the wall before calming down. If I skip a day without shaving then it is even worse.I hope I have received some kind of reject, because I feel bad for everyone else who gets one."
2,FUZZY In Virginia,"The written comments I have previously read says this product does not need replacement for about 12 months. The prior set of blades I bought through Amazon lasted about 5 months. I hope this new set, through Amazon, lasts longer or I will switch vendors/razors."
5,Resurrect your Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL,"Worth getting, comes with 3 blades and 3 disks. Do it with Amazon Prime with 2 day shipping.Makes your razer shave like new. Brings on new vigor. mm"
5,Norelco shaver heads,"These are a hard to find model in my area. We had been searching for a very long time. The were shipped quickly, and arrived before we thought they would. Altogether pleased."
2,Spare yourself the effort if your shaver is old,"I wanted to revive my old Norelco Speed XL.These new blades did not improve its function. Spare yourself the bother and get a new shaver if yours is over 5 years old. Chances are it is just plain worn out.If you DO get these replacement blades, be prepared for a devilish time opening the plastic that encases the 3 heads."
3,Good service and good price from Amazon.,"The product(new Head for razor Philips Norelco) does not seem to shave me any closer than the one in use prior to purchse, and I have had the old Head for 3 years. I think it is a myth that the Head needs to be replaced every year. I received it in a timely maner and a good price from Amazon.com. Ihave ordered several other things from Amazon and have also been happy with the timeleness and service, and price."
5,GREAT REPLACEMENT BLADES,THESE BLADES ARE GOOD AND DO A GREAT JOB WHEN SHAVING. THEY LAST FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS THEN NEED REPLACING.
5,Norelco replacement blades,"These replacements perform just like the originals. The price was good, and I would do business with again."
2,Not specific to Shar Pei's,"I ordered this book when I knew I was getting 2 Shar Pei's for Christmas. I am not familiar with the breed so did a ton of surfing on the net about them. This book received high ratings, so I ordered it.I did not think that this book offered enough information regarding health problems specific to the Shar Pei breed. It generally would reference anything that a dog could contract, but did not discuss what the Shar Pei breed could run into. I found that to be lacking.Also, it spent many pages about training for Sport which you may or may not choose (beyond sit, stay, etc.) To tought yourself as a Shar Pei book, I did not find that it discussed Shar Pei specific topics. I would not recommend buying this book if you are familar with dogs in general, and are buying a Shar Pei.If you have never lived/raised a dog, this is a short book to read for general ideals about dogs."
1,Bogus,With the price of coffee going up it appears many producers are lowering their quality control. The Blue Mountain Coffee we received was not up to the quality we expected based on the price we paid. It tastes like the cheapest beans on the market now.
5,"Awesome Bag, A bit large","This is a great sturdy bag, very well made and worth every dollar. It was pretty cheap, in fact cheaper than lower models, oddly enough. The bag itself holds anything you could want, is well padded and weather resistant. High quality metal clips and handles are great. The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was the size of it. This is maybe a plus or a minus for some, but I guess it's a trade-off if you want to carry multiple lenses etc. For me it was a bit larger than I had hoped/expected and can get a bit heavy when walking around with it for a while like at the airport or a day trip."
4,Great bag for the money!,"I didn't think this bag would be as big as it is, but I love it! I can fit my camera, 3 lenses, flash, and accessories comfortably within."
5,Great bag,Awesome bag - works great - holds everything you could need. Construction is solid and well built.
4,Good bag for the price,"After we bought our digital SLR, we were forced to admit we have a lot of cameras with a lot of little bits and pieces. In an effort to get organized, we looked for camera bags that would hold as much or all of them. This bag met our needs without breaking the bank. We managed to an SLR, a camcorder, 3 small digital cameras, and all their cords, chargers and manuals in the bag. There's still a spot for a telephoto lense, too. Sure, it's big and heavy now, but everything is in one place, and we can grab it and go if need be. The handles are comfortable, the buckles and d-rings are metal, not plastic. It seems durable, though it's too soon to tell. I'll get back to you after we drag it through some scenic family vacations."
4,Excellent product for the price,"I was very implressed with this bag. First of all i have to tell you what i fit inside this bag1. My DSLR camera with 18-70 lens,2. My 35mm SLR body3. A telephoto zoom lens 55-2004. My Sony HC-42 camcorder.5. All the manuals, filters, film rolls, a mini tripod and the cables for my DSLR and camcorder.I still have enuf room in it left to fit another lens. It has ample side and top pocket space to fit your small stuffs. Sits comfortably on your sholder. Doesn't require you to squat and place it on the ground to access the contents (like backpacks).The only reason i gave it 4-stars is, it would have been perfect with a zippered top rather than vulcrows. Well worth the money."
3,Complete case solution!,"I'm pleased with my Canon 200DG Digital Camera Bag. Although adjusting the velcro dividers was a bit fiddly, I spent a bit of time getting everything just so in order to hold everything, the bag is functional, and contains all my camera stuff. I don't have a tripod yet, so I haven't tried the straps for that. (On bottom front of the case) Not sure that I will, as I expect the tripod to weigh the bag down, so I think I'll carry it in a separate bag.That said, the bag is great, as it is a (relatively) small bag for all my gear. I have an additional small camera case -Lowepro- that holds the camera w/standard lens and spare memory cards/battery only. Much handier when I'm just out & about, but not as complete as the gadget bag for more dedicated photography. I reccomend the gadget bag, but also a smaller case for those times when you don't need to bring all you camera gear with you."
4,Great bag,"This is a great bag - it holds several lenses, digital rebel, external flash and filters. This is great for travelling and carrying all the gear - this is not as good as backpack for carrying for a day of shooting, but definitely holds everything I need."
2,What can I say? It's a $50 bag.,"This is a good bag, it really is. But, why would you want to pay $50 for this bag when you can get the Canon backpack that is $15 cheaper, bigger, easier to carry, and protects your gear just as well?It's a good bag, but the price is way, way too high."
5,Great bag for all of my cameras,"I bought this bag to store all of my camera gear in one place because it is quite big. For this reason I would consider this a travel bag and not a bag that I would consider walking around town or parks in.When I go out of town I put everything in and don't have to worry because it has ample protection for all my gear. It fits my 60D along with two lens(sigma 17-70mm and a canon 70-300mm), a SD1000(compact digital camera), and my GoPro along with various mounts. The material feels very durable and the flap on top keeps the elements out of the main compartment.I just wish it can fit the underwater housing for my SD1000 too, but I am very happy with the purchase."
2,Quality issues with metal to plastic latches,"I bought this bag based on the positive reviews and was sorely disappointed. The left hand latch does not release unless you tug, wiggle, curse,and tug some more for a good couple of minutes. The right hand latch is normal and releases immediately.In the photo it appears that the latches are metal- not quite. The top part of the latch is metal and the forked part that clips in (picture a dog's collar or harness- it's the same hardware) is plastic. I think this may be causing it to jam as I have dozens of dog collars and harnesses for my dogs that have never had this issue."
4,Nice Bag,"It is larger than I thought it would be. I am happy with it. The price was right, I would not have spent more. (total; $48.included tax and shipping total amount)"
5,A MUST for newlyweds....,We read this fantastic book on our honeymoon road trip from Wyoming to Washington D.C. and were thrilled to see that strong married values are still so important to some people. A definite must for engaged or newly married couples.
5,A strong case for executive management,"I have been in the field of Supply Chain Management for over 15 years. As such, I have reviewed and purchased many of the text on the subject. This book represents a very easy read that crystallizes many of the concepts into useful and understandable formats. Also, many of the current myths are effectively addressed and excellent examples are provided. I would recommned it both for experienced practitioners as well as the uninitiated."
3,Fair but not the best,"This bike was cute to look at Christmas morning, but after a few weeks outside with my daughter, parts started to need adjusting and to be replaced. Dont expect to pass it down to a younger sibling, but it's a fair product for the price."
4,excellent,I thought this was a very good book. It was sometimes hard to keep up with all of the characters. Her books are always easy reading and I appreciate that fact that there is no foul language in them.
2,Not the smartest heroine around,"The plot of the story wasn't bad. There weren't any unexpected twists for me but the book was interesting enough to hold my attention. What really annoyed me was the supposed heroine. I usually figure things out along with the heroine. I usually have 2 or so suspects in mind. In this book I knew almost immediately who did it. The heroine, while likeable, was extremely slow to figure things out. There were at least 3 or 4 times when a clue was staring her right in the face and she just couldn't figure it out. It started to get frustrating. And, of course, she never suspected the true culprit even though it was somewhat obvious. The main character is a psychiatrist and ex-lawyer, so I felt she should have been much smarter."
2,Not too Exciting...,"This book tried so hard to ""shock"" the reader, that it made me realize that Mary Higgins Clark doesn't know how to write for her life. If you take a look at this book, it's almost middle school level. She uses the same names, the same character ""types"" and in this book especially, it's easy to find out who the killer actually is. Not recommended."
2,A fast read but predictable.,"I have read all of MHC's books and have been disappointed by the last few. As an author she is very predictable. It is always the person you suspected least who did the crime. I've figured out her villians in the beginning of her last few books. This one, while a page turner as usual, disappointed me more than the recent others because of the ending. Once Dee, the desperate sister, was aboard her ship she was thrilled to receive flowers from Alex. The next chapter she was pointing him out to the cops from the ship and he was arrested. Where's the middle? A forthcoming explanation was never given. How did Dee, who was smitten with him, know he was guilty and how did the cops wind up at the ship. I was very disappointed in the ending of this book."
2,Very predictable and uneventful,"I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and have read all of her books. This book, however, was very disappointing. I was able to figure out everything before it happened and knew who the killer was by page 75 or 80. I was waiting for Mary Higgins Clark to throw in a plot twist that would have made my conclusions wrong, but that twist never came. This book was definitely not up to par with other books by this author. I look forward to the next, and hopefully better, one."
3,Not her Best,"""You Belong to Me"" was not Mary Higgins Clark at her best. The characters were cardboard cutouts, and Clark followed a plot pattern similar to many of her other books. I felt no real attachment to any of the characters and no real suspense, I guessed who the killer was after twenty-five pages."
3,It was easy to find out the murderer this time,"I read many of MHC's books till today. I genarally find them fascinating and easy to read especially in our fast living environment.I liked this book as well but I must admit in this book the murderer was quite obvious (or I'm customised MHC'S style so far).So,readers suspect that something should be wrong with him and match him with the crime easily.I request MHC to write a more complex book next time."
3,Different,"This was a novel written by a Russian writer and translated into english. I found the translations to be strange at times but understandable. The mystery was well written and held my interest. It was a rather slow begining, but as I progressed it became a book that I didn't wish to close. Very interesting plot."
2,"If you don't have common sense, buy it","Disappointed in this one. Serisouly thought I'd get something a little deeper and more actionable out of this book. Listening skills and treating women with respect is pretty obvious, which seem to be some of the big takeaways. If you buy this book you will get common sense generalities, e.g. never underestimate a woman; I didn't need a book to tell me that."
1,"Great idea, if it worked","This stapler was easy to use and drove the staples home well. The first 1 or 2 staples that is. After that it jams. You have to split the case to clear jams, which requires tools and patience, only to have it jam again after 1 or 2 staples.Into the trash it went."
1,Sux,"I thought since my hands are arthritic it would be easier to use this staple gun, but if it doesn't work, it isn't easier to use. I haven't even finished the second strip of T50 staples and it's jammed for the fourth time and now I cant get it unstuck. I was online looking for the instructuion manual that wasn't in the package and and found the bad reviews too late. Very disappointing."
2,Not reliable,"It seemed to work okay in the first 4-5 full loads of staples, but after a that it started to have four main problems:1. It would fire blanks due to the driver not fully cocking, when you squeeze the handle. It would feel like a half a shot.2. It would fire blanks with a full cock, and dent the wood.3. It would not fire at all. I could squeeze the handle fully, but it just compresses like a grip exerciser, and the staple just pops out weakly when the handle is released.4. The staple driver would get stuck in the up position. It got freed after I banged the tool on a hard surface.I went out an bought a regular Arrow staple gun and it has worked fine."
5,Versatile addition,"The FW26 Multi-Clip is a versatile FreeWire addition. I can use it to attached a transmitter to my tripod, monipod, camera strap, and even my belt (if there were a reason to attach it to my belt)."
1,I am perplexed.,I haven't read the book. Just trying to find out what authors are included. I am a teacher looking for a textbook for a course in autobiography. I was looking for this book's table of contents. Can you help? Thanks.
2,The Discs worked sorta,"The First 2 Disc Worked Fine but the other ones kept skipping , and the case was really torn and being hold together by tape :/"
4,"Not the best, but HIGHLY enjoyable","A lot of people out there dis this season because of the witch storyline. So it wasn't the best choice but it was bold, and it put a spin on the origin of Clark kent becoming Superman. There were some bad episodes (COUGH, Krypto, Lucy, Forever, COUGH), but there were some brilliant episodes (Crusade, Run, Transference, Commencement). Other episodes were enjoyable to watch. It's not the most PG in the Smallville series but we have to deal with the fact that Clark and the rest of the class are growing up. The whole season wasn't memorable, but it was far from forgettable. The season as a whole worked. And one of the best episodees in the history of the series was shown (Commencement). The other episodes I would recommend would be Scare, Sacred, Onyx, and Blank along with the other brillinat episodes. These weren't as good as the top four but they are really good episodes to view in line with story and cinematography. I HIGHLY recommend adding this to your collection."
2,Smallville: The Complete Fourth Season,"When I received Smallville: The Complete Fourth Season I opened it and watched the first disk and it worked fine. When I started watching the second disk it wouldn't work because of scratches. I decided to check the rest of the disks. The third, fourth, and fifth disk looked fine. When I looked at the sixth disk it looked to be covered in ice cream."
3,ok,This was brand new...but when my boyfriend and i got to about the 3rd disk there where scratches on it..we had to download the episodes because we couldn't even get the disk to play.
4,"Missing the advertised bonus ""Flash"" DVD","Acording to advertisements, an episode of the 1990 TV ""The Flash"" was suppose to be included with Smallville Season 4 DVD. It was not. I looked allthrough all the bonus features and throughout the box set. None to be found. Unless there is a hiden episode somewhere that I missed. I felt that it was false advertising, and that's why I dropped a 5 star rating to a 4."
5,"Great Season, Great Service","Being the big fan of smallville that I am, finding out the 4th season was just a couple of days away from coming out I knew I had to have it. I am currently serving w/ the US ARMY in IRAQ & was able to order the series and have it in a week. The season was awesome and getting it so fast was like icing on the cake. I can't wait for the 5th!"
4,"Still Fun, But Not The Best Season","Out of the five seasons, this is probably the weakest, but that doesn't mean this isn't good either. This season offered an original idea to the Superman mythology, black kryptonite! There are some other really interesting plots and twists in this season that are really enjoyable. Season four is mainly known for the debut of Lois Lane which I think was pulled off perfected and definitely made a memorable entrance. I agree that the worst part of the season was the whole ""Charmed"" Lana is a witch story. It was just kind of silly, especially when she started doing martial arts in China. The coolest part, however, was Margot Kidder making her appearance in the series which was awesome since Christopher Reeve had appeared prior. Overall, a pretty good season that I give four stars to just because there is a lot that I enjoyed, but not as much as the other seasons."
3,Missing,"Is anyone else missing the first part of the season finale????? Episdoe 22 was the last, but the start of episode 22 shows a re-cap of the previous events. The part that is missing is where we see Lana stab Jason's mom and Lex hides Lana. Dude this is in-complete to me...."
2,Charting the unknown...,"...would've been fantastic for this 'Complete Atlas'.The inside is very pretty, and the pull out maps are well done, although the quality of the paper on the pull-outs could've been better - I opened them once, and now dare not do it again as they may tear.As a customer who wanted these charts to enhance game play in the Star Trek roleplaying game, I was disappointed to find there were a significant amount of omissions of planets and star clusters (the Lorenze Cluster, for example)."
4,Best bang for your buck,The orange box is probably the best value in a gakme that you can get for the xbox 360. Every game on it is fun and portal is spectacular.The only con that i see is team fortress 2 does not run as well as it could because of player hosted games.
4,great value,"This game is an incredible value. It took many many hours of playing to get through the three Half-Life games, all of which are excellent. They are shooters with intriguing stories and more thinking involved than most shooters. You have to solve puzzles and employ a lot of strategy. The air boat is a blast to drive and there are great weapons such as the anti-gravity weapon which you will use a lot. You can't beat throwing a giant saw blade to cut zombies is half . The scenery and graphics are great and there are some genuinally creepy moments. I didn't even play Fortress or Portal and still felt this game was worth the money. My wife played them both and thought Portal was a standout. She loved the mystery, logic, and puzzle aspects of the game."
3,Team Fortress 2 does not have splitscreen!!!!,Overall I think this is a great game. Five games for the price of one all in one nice package. On the off hand I really believe the people who ported this game to the consoles really screwed up. Team Fortress 2 is basically useless without splitscreen. Why would you have a console game without splitscreen. Thats like saying oh you can play halo with 2+ players but only over xbox live. Too bad. hahha.
3,Buy on PC,"I love Portal, and that is the reason to own this game, but get it on PC. The main feature of this disk is Half Life 2, but on XBox 360 it plays like a less nuanced HALO. On PC Half Life 2 was brilliant, on XBox it is merely average, get this for PC and you will have made one of the best game purchases you can make, get it for XBox and you will just wish you had the PC version."
3,Clarks sandals,"These sandals were ordered in the wide width, however, would not consider them that. They were not wide enough and uncomfortable. They were returned."
3,Too much heel!,"Clarks is a good brand and these shoes are well made. However, there is too much heel, and this tends to thrust the foot too far forward. Adjustment of the straps to prevent this makes the shoe too tight on the foot."
1,Mortification of Maeterlinck,Maurice Maeterlinck was playwright! Edition of this book is horrible -- somebody converted Play into a Story. Why?!! Symbolic figures of his play are gone. This edition should never be published!
3,Overall a nice storage bag.,This is a good looking convenient bag. Has lots of compartments and tons of stuff can fit in. In general works pretty well. Here are a few drawbacks:1. The divider is set up in a way the body and lens need to be separated to be stored. I used to have a lens attached to the body all the time in my old Tamco bag and this is new to me.2. My 70-200 F4/L is too long to be stored in there. Which is not a gignatic lens.3. The partition desgin is not that flexible.Then I have only had this for a week and not sure if i know all the tricks yet.
5,Fantastic camera bag for Canon Dslr,Fantastic bag! So many movable dividers and zipper pockets. I can even strap my tripod on the side of the bag. Great matterial. Solid and protects your camera very well
5,excelent bag!,this bag fits everything! its just the right size! i use it for the canon rebel t3i with one extra lens and all the camera extras
5,"Great price, adaquate space","I recently bought a Canon Rebel camera and bought a case for it at a electronics store. It was an awkward fit for my camera body, and didn't fit the flash or extra lens. So I took it back and bought this one. Saved $20 and was able to fit my Sigma Macro lens and Ring flash, camera body, charger, etc with extra room left. There are three pockets on the outside and a handy zippered mesh pocket on the inside of the cover. It has removable partitions, so you can adjust it to have more space in the main part or organize it. Great purchase!"
5,CARRY CASE,jUST FITS MY NEEDS.THE SIZE OF THE CASE IS JUST RIGHT. OTHER CASES I HAD IN THE PAST WERE EITHER TOO LITTLE OR TOO BIG.
5,Perfect father's day gift for the man who already has almost everything,"My father received a digital SLR this past Christmas and is the type of man who buys anything he wants so I was looking for something he didn't already have to get for his birthday last month in lieu of something lame like a Home Depot Gift Card or something like that.My mom suggested a camera case since he has a few lenses for his SLR and also a digital elph he likes to use as well. Although my father has an Olympus I looked at the specs and decided that his camera body and lenses would fit in the Canon Gadget bag. Sure enough the bag was a fit. He's got three lenses, his elph as well as his back-up battery and charger and they all fit in this bag.Overall product does what it says and is of good quality. Bonus points for the prodigal son."
4,A little big but a good bag nonetheless,"I purchased this camera bag when I got my Canon Rebel XS and my Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens. I found the removable and adjustable compartments inside suprisingly usefull. It also alows for other non camera items. The bag is well put together and solid, which makes me think it will last a long time. Not sure what it's for but there are a couple plastic slots on the bottom of the bag (anyone... alittle help please??)"
5,Very nice!,It is pretty big and has many ways to create compartments! I like it it looks very good I already feel like a pro :)
3,Cannon Gaget Bag,"Bag is good for numerous lenses, etc. For just the camera the bag is to big. Would consider smaller bag in the future."
4,Exactly what I needed,"This bag was exactly what I needed for my new Canon Rebel. My family gave me a Canon EOS Rebel for my birthday & I didn't want to use my old, beat up camera bag to carry and store it in. So I looked around and found lots of nice bags. This one was perfect in that it has plenty of room for my camera, 2 extra lenses & a flash & I still have room for any extra stuff I might have. It has lots of padding to protect what's inside and through Amazon I got a great price."
2,Small Bag,"I have a digital Canon camera and the case was too small for the camera with a telephoto lens, gave it to my daughter."
4,"Quality bag, functional, and big!","I'm a beginner in SLR cameras, but I knew I would need a quality bag for my Canon Rebel XT.This bag is definitely roomy and high quality. I would have no worries about toting it around without worrying that the camera would be jarred or damaged. The bag is larger than I thought but perhaps that's necessary to fit the body and lens (attached), along with any accessories I might purchase in the future.Overall it's an awesome bag. Not convenient to grab and bring to family barbecues like a point-and-shoot camera and case was, but as a beginner I assume I'll get more comfortable with that. Especially after I start purchasing lenses and other accessories!Great bag - just what I hoped for!"
3,Too big!!,"The bag is really too big. The photos don't give you the real dimension. Be aware, if you're looking for a practical bag to easy carry out your camera, this is not the best option."
3,Camera Case,"Good items; but didn't meet my needs, so I returned it. I was looking for something that could be easy to carry and still easy to take around different sites."
2,Clips don't last.,"This bag has ample storage but the plastic clips break very easily. With a few broken clips, your stuff falls out all too easily as there is no zipper on the main compartment. I would recommend looking for another option."
4,Good Little Bag,"Got this bag about three years ago with my first DSLR (Rebel 300d) and still use it today with my XTi. A robust little bag that is very light and doesn't get in the way; actually took it to Disney World on most of the rides without a problem - just stuffed it with camera between my legs. Mine has the XTi with a 28-105 attached, a 50mm 1.8 in baggy in little triangle spot by camera (into a corner), a 70-300mm and a canon 430 flash. Pockets hold lens/CCD cleaning kit/brush, USB cord, high speed card reader (uses same cord as camera), extra black media, six 2GB cards and a portable 80GB drive for the laptop (this stays in hotel while out taking pictures). Bag also serves as a travel bag holding all sorts of other stuff. It is cramped but still remains non-bulky. I have thought about switching to a backpack (National Geographic backpack is nice) but this little guy does so well it has held me off for years."
5,Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras,"This bag is awesome. There is plenty of room and it's well padded. The only thing is that the starp does not swivel but other than that, the bag is great."
2,grill pad,"This item is not as functional as I thought. I miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose. Also, the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off. I was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon."
1,A Computer wrote a book about Joe Morgan,"Listen, I didn't read this book, but I've seen these ""Dummies"" books for 20 years now and they're all computer books. I don't need some computer telling me about baseball. I much preferred David Eckstein's ""Baseball for Leprechauns"", a book so gritty that when you shake it sand falls out."
5,Learn The Basics,Good book to learn the basics. Covers about everything a beginner needs to know about baseball in plain english.
4,Baseball for Dummies and Mummies!,"I bought this book because my son has been playing baseball for over two years, and I had no idea of the rules, being very unsporty myself! So far I have read the first few chapters and found it easy to follow with good diagrammatic support throughout. I like the fact it is written by a baseball hero and that adds a personal element and humour to the book.There are lots of useful bits and pieces about the history of baseball, equipment, and other interesting facts. I have found it a useful resource and don't feel so stupid now when I watch my son play.I am finally getting the hang of it!"
2,"Good Material, but Not For Dummies","This book has some good stuff, but it's definitely not for dummies, at least not for a baseball virgin like me. The presentation is extremely unclear and there are a lot of omissions in the main text (like, what on earth is an RBI?). After I read the book I still felt like a virgin, so I bought a copy of ""Complete Idiot's Guide for Baseball,"" which is much better and cheaper, too."
5,Must have for all teachers,"As a teacher and graduate professor, I cannot say enough about this book. It alone brought me from a reluctant writing teacher (with an intense fear of poetry) to a teacher who lives and breathes to teach writing (and poetry). When I teach teachers, this is the first book I tell them they need to read in order to transform themselves and their classrooms. Amazing book!"
5,Cosmi Aquazone Vitual Aquarium,"I'm really enjoying this fish aquarium. It is beautiful. A friend of mine had the CD and downloaded it for me on my computer at first. Unfortunately I had to put my computer in the shop and have windows 7 upgraded on it, before I had windows XP. I then decided to purchase it for myself after enjoying it so much. Thank you for such speedy delivery."
2,Nice Magazine Article for the cost of a small book,"Several years ago I read Tom Kelly's book ""The Art of Innovation"" bout IDEO. I am now part of a small spinoff company from a large international corporation, and want to put some of the ideas of IDEO to work in our environment. I thought this paper would be a nice addon to the material in Kelly's book.At four and half pages it was a nice magazine type article that gives a little update on the current operations at IDEO London office. But little new and useful about how to manage a creative group of individuals.Save your $3 for shipping on a real book, or a magazine that has several interesting articles.Amazon needs to price this sort of thing for about $0.50 if its going to go anywhere."
1,UNSTABLE Tank Stand,"This stand looks like a great deal, BUT before I even got water in the tank, it was wobbly. There is not enough support to keep this stand from wanting to twist and collapse. Further research confirmed that the lack of stability is why these stands are not available in stores anymore. I wouldn't even recommend it for any other use."
5,Music To My Ears,"Not only does the Dynasty Bells Windchime has a very nice soothing toneas it sways in the breeze/wind, but it compliments our Asian themed yardvery well."
1,Poor video quality,"My little girl loves this show! If we're talking about just the show, I give it a hands down five star review. Unfortunately the video quality from Amazon VOD is awful. Not only is the image completely fuzzy, but the audio is unrecognizable. Amazon VOD never has the highest quality, but this is flat out unacceptable. I'm working on getting a refund. Save yourself the hassle... DON'T BUY!"
3,Only 4 episodes.,"We also have all these shows from the first two seasons on our DVR and had emailed the company long ago when we were waiting for the second season. I can't believe they're finally releasing this show on DVD but they're only putting 4 episodes on one DVD. Why not the whole first season? I'd pay more and have all of it because $15 for four short episodes is too much. And I don't think they're even the best episodes. The groundhog one was one of the weaker shows, we thought. The only reason to buy this would be to get the Jack and the Beanstalk episode, and I'm not sure that's worth the price. We're really disappointed that they're releasing this great show in bits and pieces."
3,"Glad to have Jack, but wish it were better...","Our 15 mo DD loves JBMS. It was the first tv she showed any interest in & it's the only thing that will calm her down when she's at meltdown point. This'll read like deja-vu to some when I say we've got every episode on Tivo, actually two Tivos, in the house & are thrilled to be able to take Jack on the road. Wiggles & Teletubbies get a little old, but DH, myself & our 14 year old son all sing along with JBMS. I ordered this for our 8 hr drive to Seattle for the holidays, but I am dissapointed that some of the most boring episodes are on the dvd. I put it in the dvd in the car this morning & she kicked & fussed until I changed from episode to episode & then finally changed the whole disc. I think when she's going thru Jack withdrawls on a week-long vacation, this dvd will eventually make her happy, but I hope next time they'll give us a full season or another 4 of the more exciting episodes."
5,"Conducts heat well, cleans up nice","Bought this for Thanksgiving, needed a roasted with a rack for a 7-10 pound bird. This pan does the trick... Just spray a little cooking spray on the bottom before roasting and the pan cleans up like new! Have used this for just over two years and still looks great, no warping and no discoloration, would definitely buy again."
2,Not as good as the other Pure Invention teas,"I did not care for the flavor of this product. Also, I was looking for it to give me a boost in the morning, and I didn't get that. I've tried the regular green tea extract, and I really like that product."
4,Cute!!!!!!,"I saw this Barbie doll in stores,and I think she was cute for little girls.I think I am growing up,and I think that Barbie is more for younger girls,but this doll is great."
3,*&!@# SNAPS!,"Okay, so this dress is gorgeous! I mean sparkly and multi-dimensional and just everything a little girl likes in a dress. Only one problem. The ""other"" dress is ugly so my daughter has no use for turning the dress around and wants to keep the purple dress snapped so it will look fitted. The snaps refuse to stay snapped! The ugly back dress has too many ruffles for the snaps to be easy to operate. I am not a fan of velcro, but they would have done better to use velcro on this one! I am probably going to stitch the back of the dress closed."
2,It was so boring I only read half of it.,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to buy the book. Frankly, I had to struggle to get to the half-way point before I gave up on it. Who are these people who gave it such raved reviews? Are they friends of the author's or the publisher's? It was as if I was reading a different book! What ""original style""? What ""engrossing""? What ""delightful""? I will be very suspicious of these reviews from now on."
5,Perfect clamp for video camera or camera,"I purchased the Pedco UltraClamp for my motorcycle. I wanted to record video of a few rides, and this made it really, really easy.It fit nicely onto my handlebars, and it stayed in position the whole ride. It's very adjustable. The top part which screws into the bottom of your camera/video camera has a ball on it, and it'll rotate in any direction when loose. It's super-configurable."
2,Too much camera shake and the grips are falling apart,"I bought this clamp for my Suzuki SV650S. It holds up pretty well when mounted on the side mirrors and windshield. With any mount camera shake can get a little annoying but the mount keeps it firmly in place. The mount swivels in many directions for different angles. Overall a very good clamp, I would definitely recommend it!Update 3/3/2012:After a while of using this clamp I have changed my mind. If I could go back I would get the go pro instead. The camera shake on this becomes unbearable after a while. It might be ok for bicycles but on a motorcycle it's too much camera shake. The rubber grips also started to slide off and the camera screw doesn't fit my kodak very well anymore. The camcorder turns now when riding, instead of staying in place."
3,Good clamp just a bit too small,Used the clamp for the first time at autocross this weekend. The clamp is great for adjustability and being secure. But the only place I could secure it was to my Miata's door glass (dead triangular window frame). So all my videos are from the drivers door vantage point. I wanted to be able to mount it to the top of the windshield frame but the mount's screw clamp doesn't open wide enough. My advice is to get the larger mount which is able to clamp to a greater variety of places.
1,Does not work well with bike handle bars,"Warning! Its just a flat clamp so it does not work well with bike handle bars. I had it on there good and tight but whenever i hit a bump it kept popping off. Fortunately, I had the camera wristband around the handle bars so it was saved but I would not recommend this item for bike handlebars."
4,Fantastic and one of a kind!,"I used this clamp to suspend a microphone from the crossbars of a jeep. Its unique joints allow you to swivel 360 degrees in all three dimensions! What's more, the head of the screw is flat ended, intended for tables, but the curve on the top edge works really nicely for my purposes.Because the mic stays mounted on a moving (bouncing) vehicle, one of the joints tended to keep getting loose. Not a problem if you're stationary. My previous one mysteriously locked up though - maybe the threads of the screw oxidized. After much searching (I couldn't remember the make or model) I'm thrilled I finally found it again - there's nothing else configured like it. Just remember to clean it once in a while!"
3,Visual learner,I think this was probably a good book. I realized that it didn't really work for me as a learning style. I much preferred using DVDs for my work outs. I needed the interaction with a moving person on screen.
3,River boat history,"Although currently out of print, anyone with an intrigue for the old river boats will find this book resourceful. While primally a comprehensive history of the river system in the Central United States readers will find the text enjoyable and exciting. It is similar to a good novel, once started, you just can't put down until finished.The more than 900 illustrations enhance the value of this wonderful volume. Even if you are not a heavy reader, you will certainly enjoy the numerous black and white pictures.Perhaps a little light on statistical data, but generally very all-inclusive of the subject matter. Easy reading for any age (sixth grade or beyond)Since this book is not presently in-print you may want to check Amazon's zShops to see if you can pick up a copy from one of the used sellers."
4,Great product...when the can's sprayer doesn't break.,"I have fine oily hair so I was looking for a product that I could use instead of baby powder on my blond hair. I love this product the best out of all the ones I have tried. Sometimes, however, the can's srayer stops working. I have had 4 cans and 2 of them have broken. I am going to try and contact the company to get a replacement. I like this type so much better than the Ojon brand, which smells like an old ladies product. Overall works great."
2,Not as advertised,"""A tongue-in-cheek romp"" is what the front cover says -- the very first thing it says, at the very top, in bold letters. Not true. There's nothing humorous about this book. Nothing tongue in cheek. It's just like any other depressing catalogue of catastrophes and tragedies. Most of the facts it relates are correct, but many aren't. (I read a lot of history). My main objection is that this book markets itself as some kind of alternative, behind-the-scenes take on history, with humorous overtones. It isn't that at all."
4,Useful and motivating,"An excellent book to confirm if you are or not an entrepreneur. Easy to read, perfect for vacation, or to redirect your career. 4 stars!!!"
1,Centrum,"This is not a review for Centrum Silver but for this particular vendor. Placed two orders and receive one which was expired and the other one due in a couple of months. This wouldn't be as big a problem if they seemed just a mistake. But apparently, sellers had made an effort to cover the exp date with some unrelated sticker and the ship the items. So I had to tear off the sticker to reveal the dates. This is just an unacceptable practice for selling a product that goes into someones body."
4,A comprehensive history of the black church,"This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the history and sociology of the black church. It is written from an academic perspective, but -- refreshingly -- is free of academic jargon, and is accessible to the journalist, church member or student. It was written in 1990, so its research is now a bit dated. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive and thorough introduction to the the major black denominations: the National Baptists, African Methodist Episcopal, African Methodist Episcopal Zion, Christian Methodist Episcopal, Church of God in Christ, etc. It includes such useful information as a denomination's policies on women, politics and church hierarchy. I would eagerly await a new, updated edition."
4,No complaints here!,"The book was new and in great condition. The price was amazing and provided me with everything I needed for my class. What could I possibly say that's negative about an item that arrived on time, and gave me what I needed? No complaints here! Thank you again Amazon."
4,Intersting and insightful,This book made me think about certain practices that I use in variuos organizations I am involved with. Insights for improvement and success are packed into this book.
1,Business Objects,Save your money. This book is not worth the paper it is written on. It contains TONS of typos. It looks like someone did not proofread the book before hand. It looks like someone created the guide out of their home. This book is totally worthless. I am appalled that Amazon would carry such trash. Save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"You will be disappointed in this book if your are looking for tips on courage, strength, and overcoming adversity. Scarlett's rules such as ""no regrets"", ""get over it"", and ""move along with life"" are not found in this book. The book focuses on the author's rules for avoiding Scarlett's mistakes.The chapter on ""Tommorrow is another day"" contains cliches about procrastination. If you think ""Tomorrow is another day"" is about hope, opportunity, and living life, you will be overcome with a powerful urge to re-write the book yourself."
1,"Deceptive, not the original scent","Even though the description says specifically that this is the ORIGINAL scent, the blue bottle, what they actually sent me was the yellow bottle. Add the fact that this is NOT returnable, I strongly recommend against anyone buying this product. Save your money, I am very disappointed in Amazon for pulling such a shady con on their customers.EDIT: I was eventually able to contact Amazon about this and they refunded my money and let me keep the bottle (it can't be shipped back for returns). I still wish they would issue some sort of confirmation/correction about this, though."
2,Runs Small,These were not what I had hoped for. Took a long time to receive and I had to return them because size large did not even fit a mans size 9 1/2.
3,Comedy Turned into Horrifying Drama,"This movie is funny for a dog doing Karate and for Cho Cho's immitation of the Big Bopper. It turns dramatically sad very fast. Being the animal lover I am, it made me angry to see the evil scientist give the dogs that nasty Lot 99. If he wanted to take himself out, fine. But not the precious animals. I would have been twice as mad if it were the cats. It ended cute, but if one gets upset easily I suggest avoiding this one."
2,More like Karate Dumb,"Yeah, I know, Karate Dog is a really cute pooch. Who wouldn't be fooled into thinking this was a great movie? Well, don't waste your time with it. Like this is a dog, Karate Dog, and Karate Dog does Karate, but he does it like a human! As if! Anyone with a dog knows that's not going to happen. Dogs have certain kinds of dog bodies and just can't move that way. Still, it's hard for me to say the CGI dog doing karate was worse than the dog speaking English, although it was very bad. Dogs don't speak English and everyone knows it's because they don't have to. I can't help comparing this movie to one of the all time great movies, Bingo. Now that was a dog! They didn't need to make Bingo speak English or any other stupid things because Bingo was cool. I really was expecting Karate Dog to be cool, too. It wasn't. FML."
2,Cheesy movie,"A very cheesy movie, I watched it out of boredom with my brother. We pretty much watched it to make fun of it. But the romance? Come on a police woman? I never liked romance in movies they always ruin it, but this one was one of the worst. A big flop the movie, the action scenes were terrible, I only rated it 2 stars because it was so bad it was a little funny. Hope this review was helpful."
5,Really nice,"After just recently installing solar panels on my roof (and loving it), I've been going a little solar crazy and have been buying all kinds of solar toys.I bought both this and the ""30 Watt Mono-crystalline Portable Briefcase Solar Panel 12V Charger - temper proof glass"" from ""Exciting Products"". I connected both to a light duty tire inflator with a 12v cigarette lighter plug (with both PV systems in direct, noon sunlight). The briefcase panels never got the compressor moving while the Brunton started it up right away. Although listed at 26 watts, the Brunton generated more power for me than the ""30 watt"" briefcase panel.The Brunton folds easily and neatly into something that fits in a glove compartment, the finish of it is nice and you can tell it's made of good materials and workmanship.It's a great unit that truly exceeded my expectations."
3,Brunton replacement cables - awaiting shipment (update!),"Purchased Brunton 25W Foldable Solar Array to be used on expedition of western China. The unit when used in combination with a AC/DC power converter and attached to notebook computer (13"" Toshiba, new purchase on Amazon) did not charge sufficiently, weak trickle charge, and power converter screeched (low-power operational mode). The unit was useful for USB-charging through the AC/DC converter (Cobra). Purchased directly from Amazon (free shipping option), not other resellers (perhaps a better option now).Brunton 26 Watt Foldable Solar ArrayIf cable replacement is possible, please reply to this posting. Update: Finally contacted Brunton Corporate in Wyoming, USA (phone them, email doesn't work) and they are replacing the cables and standing by for the post. The power conversion AC/DC and storage device will be the next technical problem to find a solution to. Stand-alone, I will also review this product again."
4,Gave more than 40w of power in Brazil's sunlight,"Gave more than 40w of power in Brazil's sunlight, that is, more than 20V and almost 2A of current.You can connect it directly to Tekkeon battery.However, I'm worried with its durability. Read on the net that after one year its power reduced to 1/3."
4,Very Cute and Unique.,"My daughter saw this doll on TV and saved her tiny alowence up. Finally, we offered her a cash bonus for using the potty so she could get her fairy. That was the alsta accident she had. ""Blue fairy"" is a much loved and the first of the many barbie we now owe. I was amazed by the joints, the details, and the overall quality of these dolls. It's absolutley beautiful and the sparkle shirt has not come off at all. (I expected it to wear off with in weeks.) The only 2 flaws were the hair (we did not take it out of the pony tail as I could see it was not meant to be brushed) and the wings would break very easily. Oh, and blue fairies bite. Really, they do. However after a month or so in the home, the biting stops (or so I am told). Beware, the pink fairies also bite when they first come home..."
4,Great for use with fencing gloves (and weightlifting gloves)!,"I've used this for a few weeks now and I love it. It's sticky enough to stay put under my fencing glove, but not so sticky that it won't come off. It's also thin, though, so I have to make 2-3 passes around my index finger for solid blister protection. It has a tiny bit of stretch to it, but not nearly as much as fabric tapes, so I never have to deal with numb fingers because of a lack of circulation. All in all, a great tape that I will definitely buy again."
5,2003 Nissan Altima Fuel Pump,"I was very impressed at how soon the item arrived. The package arrived intact, and was easily installed. The vendor fulfilled their end of the bargain."
2,Wish I could actually hear her...,Sound quality is very bad. The music is too loud and covers up the words she is saying. Feels frustrating rather than healing.
5,1995 winner of the Christopher Award for best children's,"Won the Christopher and International Readers Awards in 1995 because it is an authentic history, fictionalized, with stunning illustrations in the style of Plains Indians. We found it in the museum stores of the Southwest, where it was a favorite of the librarians. There is also a cd-rom called Journey of Thomas Blue Eagle, done by the illustrator.It is a favorite gift book of ours and hugely appreciated by the recipients"
3,I was perfectly happy with the beige 3rd Edition...,"and other than the spiffy new silver cover, the 4th edition of this excellent book has little to distinguish it from its predecessor. If you aspire to write well, you should read this book, and if you do not own a copy of the 3rd edition, by all means purchase this latest so-called revision. If, however, you already own a copy of the 3rd edition in serviceable condition, spend your hard-earned pennies elsewhere. I wish I had."
5,everyone needs this,I can't imagine that anyone can respect themselves if they do not own a copy of The Elements of Style. How can you not own this? How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
5,Amazing book!,"Every college student, actually scratch that, every family should have this book in their bookshelf. It's an amazing book on writing a concise and commercial English."
4,An essential,"Detailed enough to be enormously handy, but short enough not to be obnoxious, this book is the ultimate pocket writer's tool. This book presents clear solutions to niggling questions of grammar, punctuation, and usage, as well as handy points on how to write clear, concise prose. If you spend any time writing, professionally or recreationally, you will find this book invaluable.I give it four stars only because it's not quite comprehensive, and more complicated questions of punctuation and usage may require the consultation of the Chicago Manual of Style, or some similar volume."
5,Stylish...To Say The Least,"What's not to like?The ""Little Book"" is a classic that nearly everyone who wants to write succinctly, as well as good-and-proper, will use time and again."
5,A Pocket Sized Book that All Writers Should Own,"I remember when I was 15 I was extremely into writing. I was a published short stories writer who thought himself to be something extraordinary. I thought I knew everything I needed to know about writing, plus more.But after reading this book, I was wrong. Elements of Style is written by one of the greatest of our generation. Not only does it give punctual guidance, but it also tries to ease you through writers block, and other problems writers face.All of the points it gives are true; guidelines that MUST be followed. I was a good writer before reading this book, but now I must say I am a GREAT writer. You can be too! Just buy this book and you will get a hold of what writing is all about."
2,"A historical curiosity, but not much more","This one is worth a look if you collect this kind of book for fun or for completeness, but there are much more thorough and thoughtful and self-aware books out there. Read Geoffrey Pullum's critique of the book in the Chronicle before buying. I would recommendKeys for Writers, 5th Editionin place of Strunk & White. It costs more, but it's probably all you'll need in terms of writing style, excepting perhaps The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association 6th Ed [Pub Manual 6E] (PAPERBACK), if APA style is required in your field.If your problem is actually sitting down and writing on a regular basis, thenHow to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writingis probably the best one.Pullum's critique: [...]"
5,Boot Camp for Writers,"Don't set pen to paper without devouring this small book. In use for decades, these guys literally wrote the primer for rules of style, grammer, and puntuation. Don't leave home without it!"
5,everyone should own a copy,"Like I said, everyone who writes stuff that will be read by many other people should own this book. In fact, mine is at home and I am suddenly feeling selfconsious about my punctuation in this review..."
4,Simply Overrated !!!,"This is an admirable book, if you want to write like the authors; it is a good book as far as it goes, but does it go far enough? Well, you will find salutary advice to resuscitate your prose, but if you want to be a fine craftsman--that is, if you don't want to beget base prose, you mustn't hang with Trunk and White for too long."
3,mascara,"Not so crazy about this mascara. It's okay but not $15.00 worth of okay...sooooooo I guess I really give it 2 1/2 stars. The brush is too thick for my taste-hard to control, easy to make big smeary mess. Brush might be okay if you have really thick really looonnggg lashes. Unfortunately, I have neither. Also, smells very... um ...fruity or something. If I spend this kind of money on mascara I'll go with Lancome or something from Sephora. In the meantime, I'll just use good old Mabeline pink tube waterproof stuff for 5 bucks.oh yeah, company was fine. They sent it really quickly. No problems with them."
5,Read this with your significant other,"Great book on the inner lives of women. Read this with your significant other and it will bring you closer. It is written from a Christian perspective, but this is not overly apparent.Great book! 5 stars!"
5,Remarkable book!,"Married for 2.5 years. I got this book on a recommendation from a friend. I also bought the companion book,For Women Only. This book was literally remarkable. I learned how many of the things I was doing, while with good intentions, we're just being missed. It helped me focus my efforts in ways that my wife would understand how much I cared and wanted to help. Guys, there is just a disconnect between the ways women and men think, and this book helps explain those differences, and helps you tweak little things so that the efforts you take are realized and appreciated. I felt like I was ""spinning my wheels"" before, now I am feeling more and more appreciated. I'd recommend this book to any guy in a relationship. One of the most significant books I've read in a long time!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I love Monet's London paintings, so I was very disappointed to find that this book contained so few of them. There are 14, by my count, out of a 215 page book with 50 pages of paintings. There are some interesting works from other artists, including Derain, Whistler, and Childe Hassam which prompted my extra star, but there are too few interesting works to carry weight of the book. And to top it off, a large chunk of the book is devoted to drawings and photographs. Not exactly what I would expected when looking for a book on Monet and his London Paintings"
