4,Interesting Movie,"The Big Bad Swim is a very good movie. It is well written, directed, and has excellent acting performances. It is I guess a slice of life type movie with a lot of human interaction. For some it may be a little slow paced or some might call it a chick flick, but I found it interesting on many levels and a very pleasant surprise. I only gave it 4 stars, but if anything that underrates this movie. Still it is not quite a 5 star movie.The movie is centered around basic premises that some people are extremely afraid of water even in the shallow end of the pool. I know this to be true as I taught such adults one summer while in college. There were four in the class that would have drowned in four feet of water if they ever fell over. The panic they felt would literally paralyze them to the point they could not stand up.Anyway this movie is enjoyable on many levels."
5,"warm, feel good character study","A quiet, warm - yet sad, touching character study. Nicely done, especially the cinematography."
2,no difference,I have used this about ten times and I really don't notice anything better. If I use it or not the plants have just the same survival chance!!!!
2,SNORE!,"Like some other reviewers, I had high hopes for this book after seeing Robinson's TED talk on creativity and schools. Honestly, for a book about creativity, this is one of the least creative books I've read in a while.I'm an avid reader and typically read at least 1 - 3 non-fiction books a month. I started this quite a while ago and have yet to finish it. It was just so boring.This is not to say that there is no valuable information; it's just not presented in a very fresh way.I also took the rating down because of the subtitle of the book. This book is not about learning to be creative... at least not up to halfway through it. I expected more technique for enhancing my own creative skills. This book didn't deliver what it seemed to promise in the title."
4,Another Great Book From Dun!,"David Dun has done it again, crafting an exciting thriller with well-developed characters and a keep-you-reading plot. I highly recommend this book, as well as Dun's earlier thrillers, ""Necessary Evil"" and ""At the Edge."" Dun promises to be a prolific force in the fiction/thriller genre!"
2,Not believable,"Perhaps it's just me but the main character in this book is too over the top. It got to be redundant the constant reminders of how much Melina loves sex, men, etc. Yet she feels hurt when Sebastian politely questioned the paternity of her child. What about loose ends. What happened to these wayward Mothers who left their children. They got enough coverage in the book but no resolution. Is Diana buried in GrandMa's back yard; Are these questions to be answered in another book? I like the author's style of writing, just not this character."
5,Bought as a gift,I purchased this Movie for my grandson and he loved it. He bought a large TV for Xmas so he could watch Blu-raysThank you!
4,Great movie for a video game,"If you had really high expectations for this movie because it was a great video game series to you, then you might be looking for a different movie. If you're looking for an entertaining, slightly corny horror movie to watch that has some really creepy moments, than this is a good choice for you. It doesn't follow the video game series too well, but in its own right it has a great storyline. Definitely better than a lot of B-rated horror movies out today, you can tell the budget was much higher. Also, the Blu-Ray edition of this dvd is phenominal - the high def image is one of the most fantastic I've ever seen. It really does bring this movie to life."
4,Pretty good movie,"This is a pretty good movie, could of been better. If your like me and are a fan of movies based on Video Games then this is a must have."
1,Snoozing Hill,"The entire movie is a mother wandering around a town looking for her daughter, who's disappeared into some spooky underworld. Only it's not spooky.The cinematography is pretty good, giving interesting angles and sweeps. Only you can tell you're in a video game as you go from the hotel level to the school level to the church level and so on.The acting is really solid. That is, if we're referring to cardboard cutouts of actual humans.The demon creatures are terrifying. If you're under age 7 and have never seen a horror movie before.Not scary. Not suspenseful. Not entertaining.Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't bother."
1,Horror-ble!!!!,"Once again, as an avid horror movie fan, I have to say that I've been dupped again by Hollywood and the complete garbage that they pump out in this modern era.First of all, there is a complete lack of explaination of what is going on in the begining of the film. I'm not sure if this script was written by a 10 year old or what, but the dialouge may be amongst the worst I have ever seen.It appears that this movie is taken from a video game (which it is) considering that the effects look nothing more than just that - a high budget video game.Not scary, not well written at all, not suspensefull, not even worth renting at your local video store. It was so bad that I wanted to throw it into the garbage when I was done.If you kids (assuming from your five and four star reviews you gave, you're all under 16?) want to watch a solid horror movie or two, try The Burning, The Prowler, Maniac, or the recenty release and remake of the Hills Have Eyes. This movie is diahrea is comparison!!"
4,Truly unique...,"Even if you are not a fan of the video games you should give this one a try. This is one of the most unique horror films I've ever seen. Just know going into it that it is going to get pretty weird. The atmosphere is truly creepy, good acting, and an interesting story. If you find yourself weirded out at first watch it again, and you will understand it better. This one is definetely worth watching."
4,Atmospheric horror maze...,"This movie sure takes the viewer on a wild ride, this film had so manyinteresting sets and I really got into the darkness episodes, althoughit didn't make alot of sense in places, it makes up for the lack of a plot, just how you'd want to throw a ""plot"" into this disorientation, Ididn't want a plot, I felt like it was a big maze and one eye-opener set of visuals after the other, kept me clued to this film. Very graphic in spots, fire and brimstone, dig the wardrope designs on this movie, and the soundtrack musicwas industrial doom and led you along. Atmospheric and well acted, this filmhas some of the best dreamlike direction I've seen in the horror genrein quite awhile. Those horror movie buffs raised on killer slasher movieswith blood and sexual atmosphere will most likely be bored with thisone, I like the unpredictable chills and the creatures, bugs, were welldone. I know this comes from the video game which I have not experienced,its done fine with me on it own merit."
5,Excellent Mind bender!,This is an excellent movie. Probably the best I've seen in a decade. Combines thrilling effects with a suspense filled storyline.
5,So cool.,"Yes, the visuals were amazingly close to the game and were awesome. I think the plot was very interesting and kept me intersted all the way through. The end leaves it open for interpretation, and I hope there is a sequel!! Watch out for the siren. Not a very scary movie, but more of a psychological thriller. Finally a video game to movie done right."
2,This DVD will not become worn out...,"This DVD will not become worn out - as least not at my house. The plot was tangled nearly beyond repair and it did not give me the thrills that I desire from a ""scary"" movie. Admittedly, I am not a blood and guts fan but I expect a good story line that does not challenge my ability to put the pieces together. And disgust does not replace a good old-fashioned shriek of fright. I was disappointed."
3,Cool effects cool gore!,The 3 stars are for then skin ripping scene and some other cool gore Great movie over all but the ending threw me off.
2,hard to watch,"Silent Hill is not one of my favorites.It's about a young woman named Rose who adopts a girl named Sharon,who constantly sleepwalks and mentions a place called Silent Hill.So,Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill,an old and burned down villiage.After a car accident,Rose finds that Sharon is gone and goes on a quest to look for her.From there,we are constantly bombarded with this alarming siren and the arrival of these burned,creepy looking figures of people long dead.Finally,with the help of a curious policewoman,Rose searches Silent Hill for her daughter,coming upon weirder and weirder things.Finally,she discovers that a young girl who looks quite like Sharon was burned there,named Alessa,and meets the tyrannical leader of Silent Hill,Christabella,who burned Alessa years earlier.Lets just say that Christabella gets what she deserves in the end.Not a favorite,like I said."
1,Glad I rented the DVD and didn't waste my money,"I was really excited about this movie, as I've played the Silent Hill game and loved it. It's really sad when the video game had more plot than the movie did.It might have been better if they'd done the plot to Silent Hill 2 where a man comes to Silent Hill because his dead wife is sending him messages to meet her in Silent Hill. That would make more sense than the thin plot of this movie.While the sets were exactly as in Silent Hill, you really need more than that to make a good movie. You need a real story. And this one doesn't really have one."
1,Terrible,"I guess you have to be a ""fan"" of the video game to appreciate the garbage movie this was. Drab and depressing movie with a terrible ending you could see a mile away. Honestly, this has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Silent Hill,"Silent Hill is now the best video game turned film yet. I haven't seen a film with such a great atmosphere and creepiness throughout a WHOLE movie since The Ring. The effects were so realistic it was unbelieveable. The story and effects deffinetly made up for the poor acting. I love Sean Bean though, he is a very good actor. I think Radha Mitchell(Rose) is a good actress, but she is not very good in the horror department. I didn't have very high hopes going to see this film, but I was surprised at how good it was. I highly recommend seeing this film."
4,I liked it,"Has the same problems as all video-game based movies, it has a lot of hype to live up to, and it's target audience is small. But overall I thought it was pretty well done."
4,"Love the Movie, DVD case arrived damaged..","With the premier of the newest Silent Hill hitting the movie theater's, I had to buy this movie immediately. It arrived really quick, but the DVD case itself was broken and the disk was just flopping around the case. Luckily there was no damage on the disk and I didn't have to send it back!!! Over all I am happy with the purchase and very happy I didn't have to deal with sending it back.The movie is great, the ending has something to be desired, but non the less its a horror flick. If you like this type of movie, then I definitely suggest to add this one"
2,so so...,"Book covers alot of topics related to robotics, but fails to do so at more detailed levels.Good book for general information, but would not recommend it to anyone looking to get any ""real"" information for implementation."
4,Does almost everything it says with one minor glitch,"I originally thought this device would allow me to make skypeout calls but it kinda does. In order for me to make outbound calls via skype I would have to set them up as a speed dial number. other than that it does exactly as it is advertised to do, which is connect both VOIP and land lines in an easy to use self powered appliance. My only gripe after having it for a couple months, the box occasionally needs a reset (disconnected and reconnect) because the VOIP doesn't ring through."
4,Reviews Wither and Die,"Very simply, for those interested in Dogen and his ""Genjo-Koan"", there is no other meaningful commentary available in English. This one is originally written in Japanese and has a Japanese sensibility, but is well translated and delves deeply into the nuances of Dogen's masterpiece. One can quibble with Yasutani's interpretations, but at the end of the day Dogen is just a mirror in which the face of the commentator is reflected -- everyone can and will have their theory about what our favorite Soto Zen Master was actually saying in his cryptic, exuberant, philosophical tour de force. Yasutani has more than one axe to grind but that just adds spice to the mix. All in all, a must-read for the Dogen and Genjo-Koan student."
2,"Fantastic songs, but there are better Card compilations.","This was one of the first Michael Card CDs I ever bought. I bought it mainly because my all-time favorite Michael Card song was on it: ""Love Crucified Arose"".I wish I had known at that time about Michael Card's THE EARLY WORKS. This particular CD features far more Card classics than LEGACY. All of the the songs on LEGACY also appear on THE EARLY WORKS, with the exceptions of ""Livin' We Die"" (which is one of Card's least enjoyable songs), ""Tell the World that Jesus Loves You"", and ""Abba Father"" (available one of his much better comilation CDs entitled SIGNATURE SONGS). Furthermore, THE EARLY WORKS features three other classics that are unavailable on any other Card CD.If you're new to Michael Card's music or new to his classics, there are much better choices than this one."
4,easy to use and comfortable,I have never used a grazing muzzle before so was happy this was easy to use and comfortable for my horse.
2,Part of a collection of cds I will probably never listen to,"I know DMC has health problems. I thought I'd support DMC by piking up his cd, but what waste of money. It seems he's hardly on the album. When he is rapping, it doesn't sound like his voice or his lyrics. The production is very vanilla. Probably done with no name producers. At least it was cheap."
4,Interesting pricing,I choose this rating because my husband like it. I was not happy when I went into our local drug store and seen the same item for $19.99 and I just paid $ 40.00.
2,I gave as a gift.,It did not hold up and the the manufacturer did not honor their warranty. Would not buy their products.This is not a good product. We had bought and used before but the product is no longer good.
1,Save your money!!!,"I bought this at Walmart just before Xmas. It is junk and not worth $20. It is easy to use and fits most gel and foam cans (not Nivea or the standard foam cans). If you ever went trick or treating as a teenager (you know what I mean) then you can certainly pop the top off the can and put this together. The problems with this thing is:1) The gel does not get warm enough even at its highest setting.2) It cools off to room temp as soon as you get it to your face.If you do not want clutter on your counter then you have to put it away after each use.3) It recommends that you unplug it after and between uses.4) Very hard to clean.This would work great if you could dispense it from the can right onto your face. If you want a warm and great shave, then spend $5 and get a fog free mirror and shave in the shower. If you like to blow money and throwing $20 away is your thing then get this."
2,Not so great with Lather,"I bought this item and used it with shave gel. It worked good, heated to a good temperature, but not exactly hot. But I didn't like the smell of the gel when it was heated. I bought shave lather and when trying to use it the lather comes out all over the unit. I reseated the lather container several times and each time it just flow out every open space. I have since thrown it away. I will try one of the other models and see if I have better luck."
3,not worth it,it broke after a week of usage and the hot lather is only hot for a couple of minutes. Well i guess you get what yoyu pay for.
4,Nice little gadget,"Some people complained that the shaving cream didn't get hot enough and I can attest to that. BUT it does get really warm and works in loosening up the skin and does provide a good, clean shave."
1,Need a paper weight!!!!!!,"The lather machine did arrive in a timely manner, however this thing was one incredible pile of garbage. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but at least be functional for a year. Well it only worked for about a week. Whatever you do, don't buy this thing!"
1,Top heavy,"IT was fine to use, but it is top heavy once you get teh shaving cream can attached to the top and fell down several times until I finally just threw it away."
2,messy,Not very happy with the product. The shaving cream keeps oozing out of the machine slowly throughout the day so there is a small pile of shaving cream on the counter all the time. I wouldn't recomend it for that reason alone.
4,It works for me!,"After reading previous reviews, I doubted this product would work well. But, for the price, I thought I would take a chance. First, all the complaints about setting it up are misplaced. I had no problem at all. If you are able to read the instructions, and us a bit of common sense, installing the shaving cream/gel cans is very easy. The lather warms up to a nice temperature. I have been using it now for about a month and look forward to my daily shave. Great product. Thank goodness for Amazon, I couldn't find this at any of our local stores. And the price was great."
2,Wasn't sad when it broke,"It broke after only 8 months of light use. A seal broke and when you would press the button, foam would shoot out of pretty much every seam except the nozzle. I wasn't able to fix it. During the 8 months it worked, I felt the foam was kind of warm but certainly not warm enough. Plus not enough foam gets heated. Usually the last 20% that I put on didn't get heated at all. Also, most of the foam cans that I bought wouldn't fit inside the plastic sheath so I just had the heating unit sitting on top of the can."
2,Gel does not get hot enough..,"My husband has had something like this several times in the past. It's always been hit or miss. I decided to give this one a try despite all the mixed reviews. Set up was easy, but my husband says it does not get very hot at all. He uses gel and though we believe it may work better with cream, he is unwilling to give up his favorite brand. If you use gel and are unwilling to make a change, I would not suggest this product."
1,the worst,I bought this from Amazon/Macy's last week. It didn't heat up regular lather adequately. I then tried using gel. What a joke. As soon as I inserted the gel can the gel kept leaking out and out and out. I then find I can't return it to Macy's because I bought it from Amazon and if I use return shipping form it will cost me $6.95. I threw the darned thing in the trash. A truly bad experience. I am out almost $30 and have lost some faith in internet shopping. You should be able to return an item and not have to pay $7 for the privilege.
3,half and half,"Have not yet had it that long but set up is not that complicated. So far I tried it with a gel and it warmed up somewhat, but I did not really give it a chance to heat up. I think it will work better with a foam shaving cream"
1,rip off,"this cd sucks ass. it is not rare. you can still order it from a music store. the only good song on it is ""gettin high"" by A.M.W. if it werent for that this whole compilation would be garbage."
3,Better for lower foreign language levels,"If you want to use these ideas for your high school students, think twice. The ideas are good but not so appropriate for secondary school. I got some ideas that I'll modify for my students. It is an entertaining book and you can always get something out of it (but don't expect much if you are a high school teacher)."
2,"nice looking, birds haven't touched it",I wanted something nicer than a finch sock hanging in my yard but I've had it up for over a month and no bird has touched it. It is nice looking and seems sturdy but if it doesn't attract birds it is hard to rate it higher than two stars.
1,Birds Hate This,"I purchased this feeder for my Father. The Birds won't go near is. Not sure what the problem is; I think it is because the holes are too small and they can't get seed. I tried making the holes larger with a drill, but still no good."
2,doesn't hold up well to squirrels,"for a reasonably expensive feeder, this one frustrated me by lasting only about one month before squirrels chewed through the canister."
1,Nice style but finish faded quickly,"I liked the color, style and spiral perches on this feeder, however the yellow finish faded and turned cloudy after hanging outside for just two months. It is dull now and not as bright as it was. Unfortunately it is beyond the return window. I may spray paint it but feel I should have been able to exchange it. The seed tends to rot quickly inside unless eaten fast by the birds or protected from rain/water.."
4,Great for not digesting capsules,"A lot of people can suffer from mild stomach pains from taking capsule pills, with the option of this liquid Vitamin C it's easy to get the amount you want. Bottle says to have up to 10 drops a day, and has 50 servings, allowing up to 500 drops of pure vitamin C. This will last you a long time especially if you don't intend on using it awhile."
3,Better for those starting out.,"This book is excellent for anyone interested in the basics of endocrine physiology - unfortunately it fails to go into sufficient depth for anyone trained to at least an undergraduate level knowledge of physiology. Some sections are reasonably detailed, but the treatment of the adrenals was way too brief to be effective."
4,"Blunt good, but not complete","The book is an excellent introduction to the International Phonetic Alphabet. It actually tells you which position your mouth should be in for the correct creation of these sounds. The accents shown in this book are great for the beginner, but lack real authority when going for accuracy. Blunt is just that...blunt. The accompanying tapes are crude to be nice. They should be re-recorded for an actual production value. The source material however is amazingly good in showing the beginner the differences in sounds between English and other accents.Woefully incomplete when dealing with African, Latin American, and regional United States accents. There is a second book entitled More Stage Dialects which would hopefully complement this problem.Needed in the desription are the accents covered; Russian, German, Italian, French, British RF, Cockney, American Southern, etc. All in all a good purchase for the price."
5,dog pin,pin arrived faster than expected and was well packaged. It is sturdy and well made. I like the sleek and flowing design. I used this as a accent piece in a serving tray I built for a friend who loves these dogs.
2,Christian reading,Good enough story. This is a Christian book that questions evolution. Wish I had known before I started to read . Might be good for someone who is looking for answers to God vs science.
3,"Fred, Texas parody","An insightful look into the life of a young lad, with plenty of humor. I lived in Texas in the 70's, don't remember any towns where the kids were this wild"
5,A great read! Funny and very original,"This is a book you pick up and just keep reading and reading when you have other things you really need to do. Brad Whittington takes the fish-out-of-water, coming-of-age story and spins it like a top. Great characters, great dialogue, warm story, very true to life."
4,Got His Number,"I have Mark Cross' number. The narrator of Brad Whittington's fine novel, ""Welcome to Fred,"" gets a 999 for turning the sadness - and evil - he confronts topsy-turvy or every-which-way, but never loose. Mark is a Preacher's Kid desperate for an attitude. We get to look over his shoulder as he struggles to find an attitude he's comfortable with. You've never read a better rendering of a what-I-did-on-my-summer-vaction story than Mark's ode to Southern Baptists and the art of Galaxy maintenance that graces the last quarter of ""Welcome to Fred.""Although Mark's life in Fred, Texas is full of hoots,hollers and happenstance - both happy and sad - Whittington sets the real power of the story in Middletown, Ohio and in L.A. Remember the name Pauline. She will lodge in your memory along with the most memorable people you've ever met between the covers of a book. And you'll be glad she's there and thank Whittington for that."
4,ANDROMEDA - Back to Get' R Done!,"Andromeda, back in its final season with a bang! Sure the show lost a chunk of the budget that they have had with previous seasons but that doesn't stop the writers from coming up with a nice season long story arc which delivers! Any sci-fi fan with a love of action should add this volume to their collection. Andromeda just plain ROCKS! (4 stars because we should be on collection 5 by NOW!)"
2,Horrible domestic violence,"I was shocked by the domestic violence in this book. I've read dozens if not hundreds of Regencies, and I have never been so upset by a plot. The book is well-written, and the characters are well-developed. I got emotionally involved, so when ""happily-ever-after"" came just a few chapters after the violence, I was still seething on behalf of April. I read Regencies for fun and escape, not for real world brutality."
3,Pretty Book with interesting recipes,"I was given this book by my lovely sister in law for my 2 children. Unfortunately, whilst the recipes sound lovely and they do work out, my family disliked all of them! I liked them but I am the only vegetarian in the house. I guess it depends what type of food you like. If you like the ingredients you will probably like the recipes. So if you are a vegetarian you will probably think it is great! Otherwise you may have a lot of converting to do."
3,Custom udev fixes problems with linux,"This drive is very quiet, but it has problems getting mounted and staying mounted.The good news is that I haven't lost any data. The bad news is that it is finicky. The degree of finickiness and the precise manifestations depend on the operating system and hardware used in conjunction with this device.When used with Vista, installing Seagate DiskWizard (a free download), sometimes helped.The drive comes formatted as one big ntfs partition. It worked better for me with Windows XP after I reformatted it with a FAT partition.With Linux the drive stops working if you don't use it for a period of time, then you get I/O errors that you can correct with fsck. This problem can be completely corrected by making a custom udev. See wsms.wikiplanet.com/mediawiki/index.php/FreeAgent"
2,flawed design,"pros: the drive comes in a slick package, and is gorgeous. the side light fades in-and-out on drive reads. it is silent (more on this), and setup was very easy (just plug and play under XP).cons: this drive is simply not reliable by virtue of its design. there is no fan to cool the drive. passive cooling is achieved by 2 metal plates enclosing the drive which is in turned encased by the plastic. as a result the drive overheats easily. after a few weeks, my drive developed ""$MFT delayed write failed"" even though delayed writes were disabled through the OS. it became unrecognizable. in order to access the drive to salvage data, I had to have a large table fan blow at the tiny vents to cool the drive. This made it stable enough to transfer data out of the drive. However, this is simply not acceptable."
3,A pretty good book,"Most of the book was well-written. Other parts were not so well-written.The chapter on time seemed interesting at first, but then he got into an argument about the past and the future, and tried to make a point that they contradict each other, but his conculsion didn't make sense to me. So I skipped the rest of the chapter and went on.Later in the book he got into some math symbology which I don't think he explained it very well. But I found I could skim over that stuff and still understand the material.Also, in the Kindle device, some of the special characters and tables don't show up very well.But the book is not bad for the price, and a good way to test the waters if you're not sure if you'll enjoy studying logic.You also might want to try Gensler's book. I'm reading it now. It costs a lot more, but it seems more well-written."
2,Very strange,"I figured that I'd try this since I have the book. Actually, if you spend time reading the book, which is very helpful, you'll learn volumes more about scales and chords. The narrator/player cruises though at such a high rate of speed through all sections that it almost requires you to know what he is doing before hand to understand. I'm not writing this from a beginners point of view but as a warning to those who think it may be a nice introduction; it really isn't. The reviews that gave it 5 stars puzzles me and I'm truly and honestly being sincere when I say this. Get the book before this video and you'll know what I mean. As an aside, to call the whole wizardry thing being cheesy is an understatement. I wouldn't call it satanic, just not necessary. If anyone's interested I'll sell you my copy.. It really is of no value.."
2,LMB's bad premise poisons an otherwise stellar novel.,"Well written but the device used to change Miles' from Star Hopping Merc to Planet bound grub was unacceptable, unbelievable, and unworthy."
2,too dull and boring,"After is saw the 2002 version starring Jim Caviezel and Dagmara Domincyzk, which is my favorite movie ever, I was hungry for more. So I headed to my local library, and found this old tape hidden behind the 2002 one. I was overjoiced. The back says 'A swashbuckling tale of injustice and revenge'. Swashbuckling my eye! This movie has one swordfight, yes ONE, at the very end. This version is EXTREMELY boring and slow-paced. Be warned, this is not a good action/adventure. It doesn't even have a beautiful Mercedes."
4,Class Reunion Masscare,"Class Reunion Massacre is the title I know this film by.Originally released via Continental Video in the 1980s in the big box casing, this is a early slaser released the same year as Halloween, This doesnt come close to the tension and atmosphere that Carpetners film has but its definately a cut above the typical slasher.Ive never really given much to the thought that this is a ""religious"" horror film, There are a few scenes early in the film which might argue that point. Either way, this is a MUST-OWN. Period.Slaughter High and Terror Train both borrow from this film I would say.Its a Must Own"
3,"Clayton Graphics, on Epson T5846","While the finished output of PictureMate 290 is excellent, the ink cartridge inthe T5846 print packs only last long enough to use 50-80 of the enclosed 150 4X6 paper sheets."
5,Epson print pack,This product is very good. I have bought other brands and I am most satisfied with the Epson brand.You don't have to wait for the pictures to dry and the pictures come out very clear.
3,"easy, but doesnt last long if you dont print","this a convenient pack, but this is my third pack, but i have a whole lot of paper, and not a whole lot of ink due to the nozzles clogging and such. dont let this sit. print whenever you can. else you will be buying this again."
3,Printer pack,I love my photo printer but the paper and ink never run out at the same time. You can buy the paper and ink separately and usually I am forced to do so. Getting them together is more convenient.
5,A throughly thought provoking book of meaningful mediations.,"In this book, Gunilla opened my heart and mind to new ideas. She repeatedly gave me the image of a bowl--a bowl like my emptiness--a bowl calling out. And "" Autumn"" is a poem that I will always treasure. Already many women in my life have grown spiritually through this small jem!! I would highly recommend ""Becoming Bread"" to anyone who is trying to understand the process of ""becoming"" or changing"
1,A Total Dud,"While this game might seem appealing by the box art work, the game is incomplete. First, it states on the box (in small type) that you'll need to purchase additional game cartridges in order to play this. The sad fact is that the maker, Irwin Toys, never produced the game cartridges! There is no way you can actually play this game since the additional software isn't out there.Second, when I contacted Irwin Toys, they failed to respond back (the email bounced back). This is not only bad customer service but also makes me think they've abandoned this product entirely. While I've seen the game sold at a discount at many online stores, this game is unplayable out of the box. With no cartridges or anything to play it with, its just plastic!"
3,Pretty good,"A pretty good book. Many humorous parts, but probably more serious overall. He talks about his whole life, the people he met, his family, and what was the inspiration for each play. I recommend it."
5,As Good as Moss Hart's,"and that is very high praise, since Hart's autobio is generally considered a stellar achievement. (I just loved it.)I had had ""Rewrites"" on my bookshelf for a number of years, and just somehow never got around to it. Finally, one snowy weekend last month, I took it off the shelf and started reading. I loved it from the get-go -- it's simply one of the best memoirs ever written, IMO. (I've read a lot of autobios/memoirs, especially in my younger years, so I write with some knowledge in this area.)I'll always remember that snowy weekend I spent ""with Neil,"" and I'll also always remember how I ran to get the sequel, ""The Play Goes On,"" on Monday. (That was also top-notch, but ""Rewrites"" was just a smidge better.)Don't miss ""Rewrites."" It's a winner, it's a keeper, it's pure reading delight!"
2,Faulty Ink Cartridge?,"I've purchased this print pack many times before and the print cartridge ink lasts almost as long as the 100 photo sheets. I just got a message of low ink - it looks like its 75% used up, and I've only printed less than 20 photos. Pretty disappointing! Maybe it's better to purchase the cartridges and paper separately."
1,"Tape of ""The Way We Live Now''",this was recieved with great excitment only to find that the second tape was recorded so low that it is impossible to hear and therefor the listener has abanded the whole set and we do not know the quality of the rest of the set
5,SCARY AND HAUNTING THE GRAVEYARD,one of king's album's definately going to be good to use on halloween to scare kids this halloween when they come to my house trick or treating. king has a unique vocal style so haunting and his concepts are cool face it king rules king of metal....i really enjoy this album the song black hill sanitarium and heads on the walls are so heavy while the for example the song up from the grave that there scare the fins of a shark ...bye 4-now cool king diamond .
2,"Um, did I miss something?!?","I don't get it ... (hed) pe seems to have built their career on not caring what anyone thinks and saying f*** you to the establishment ... and then they release a ""Best of"" disc?!?! What?The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because the tunes are great. The concept of a ""Best of"" disc kills it, though.I've been a fan of (hed) pe since their first disc and have seen them a few times in clubs and I just don't get this. One other reviewer said something about this feeling like the record label milking the band ... totally agree. And if thst's the case, why would the band let the label do that?There seems to be fewer and fewer bands out there that truly do whatever they want without regard to what anyone else thinks and (hed)pe used to be one of them.**cough** sell out **cough**"
4,Relaxing breath into reality,"A nice recent release from Colby. The best CD design I have seen with the black record like appearence. Excellent sound, well engineered record. Well worth owning! Make sure you don't miss this!"
5,"Muchas gracias, Papi!!!","When my Mexican father came to the U.S., he was hooked on the Temptations, Four Tops, Creedence. When he got a little older, he started getting back to what he listened to as a young man growing up in Mexico. This is one of our favorite cd's, along with Los Tres Diamantes and Los Panchos. Great songs, great emotion, great harmonies. All in all, a wonderful piece to add to any great, well-rounded music collection."
3,Not good for learning to pedal,"We bought this tricycle for our son a year and a half ago ). We thought the free-wheel feature was great for pushing him around while he gets used to being on the bike. What we didn't realize is that this feature didn't give him the feedback of moving pedals and he still doesn't pedal this bike on his own. He can ride ""normal"" tricycles just fine, but he thinks that he needs to pushed on this one. We are now conteplating buying a much less expensive ""normal"" tricycle so that he gets confidence with pedaling enough to ride the brummi on his own. In hindsight, we would have NEVER purchased a bike with the free-wheeling feature (especially not for the price). However, the bike is well made and will last a long time."
1,Truly awful exploitation of the gullible,"Villoldo has been a disgrace within his profession for decades, an example of the worst forms of exploitation of white fantasies, misconceptions, and wishful thinking about Native people, and with a long and ignoble history of deceiving the poor unfortunates who actually think this nonsense has ANYTHING to do with what Natives in South America do or practice.NOTHING in this book is practiced anywhere by ANY Native people. Silliness like ""lightworking"" is strictly from the New Age movement. This book is only for people who delude themselves into thinking a book can make them a ""shaman."" Sorry, Villoldo has sold you a load of snake oil.Any help one receives from Villoldo's books or workshops is purely coincidental, just the Placebo Effect at work.Even worse, some people are harmed (and even die) because they turned to Villoldo instead of people who could actually help them."
5,My kids and I enjoy this interesting piece of artistry.,"My kids love it, and I want to find a DVD of it. Anyone have one (in good condition, of course), they are willing to part with at a reasonable cost?I Hope so!"
1,Don't buy this lamp,"This lamp looks adorable and I loved using all the hooks for my daughter's bibs. But the thing broke after only 2 months!! It's not the bulb, the lamp just stopped working. I'm really disappointed."
2,a ruined classic,"These cartoons are part of war memoribilia and gave soldiers something to laugh at when they were being shot at. However, the quality of these transfers is horrible. Instead of being cropped properly and resized, they meerly blotted out alot around the edges. And the logo..please...DO NOT buy this collection, wait until someone does a proper release"
2,So-So Video on Wartime Cartoons,"This video is a real dissapointment. First, they don't show the openings, the WB bullseye and the MGM lion, or the ending signs(""That's all, Folks!"" for example). Second, the Dolby Surround Sound makes it stupid because it's not the original version. The quality on ""Scrap Happy Daffy"" is horrible! The only thing ""Any Bonds Today?"", is useful for is because they don't edit Bugs' immitation of Al Jolson."
5,Extraordinary Old School Rumberos!,"Patato y Totico were legends back in the day. This exemplary album was the kind that you played until the record had more ""popcorn"" than clave. It is wonderful that this art has been brought back to life. This is not Cuban Son, as another writer commented. This is guaguanco callejero at its best. You can remember Brooklyn, the Bronx, Harlem as well has Havana and the caserios of San Juan. What a gift."
1,Don't take a gamble with this toy,"This is such a boring toy to my son. I have even tried to seem excited about it when I bring this toy out, but he was completely uninterested from the start. Also, at 3 months old, he couldn't even press or grab onto the levers. I thought maybe he was too young so I would keep trying it, it didn't seem to matter though as it seemed to get less interesting as the stages progressed."
5,Our daughter's favorite toy,"My mom got this for our daughter at about 3.5 months. She's been playing with it now for two months and it continues to be her favorite toy. When she started, we would just put the classical music on for 15 minutes and she'd watch the patterns light up. Gradually, she started to use her feet to push the levers, and then her hands. We think it's really helped her develop her reaching skills. Initially, she showed no interest in the other screens, but about three weeks ago we put in the baby faces screen and she started to squeel with delight. She also is enjoying the 3rd screen (animals) at this point.If she's fussy, we can often let her ""play her music"" by laying down under the gym, and she'll happily play with it for a while. We also like to do sing-alongs with her and the music..."
2,Disappointing,"Many of my issues with this book were covered in another review. Most of the ""plans"" are really just a couple tracks. The diagrams aren't clear enough for a book on track planning (for a magazine writeup, maybe, for a book of plans for practical use, no). The plans are repetitive and derivative of each other. And, as previously noted, there is very little breadth of offering - over and over you see the same format of layout: for instance if you have any significant-size space but don't want a multi-deck layout, you're out of luck.It's not 101 layouts, it's 101 variations on 2-4 basic ideas..."
4,Review of The Little Oracle that Goes a Long Way,"This rating is based primarily on the delivery service and the state of the product. The product arrived in good condition a few days before the final delivery date.Unfortunately, I have not completed reading the book as yet. Therefore, I cannot provide a satisfactory rating regarding the content of this book."
3,Twila's first album,"This was Twila Paris's first album under a major label. However, the style she is now famous for will not be found on here. Instead, the music and Twila's singing sounds more like a sound-alike of Sandi Patti. There are some great songs nonetheless, such as Elijah, Turn Around, Spring Water, and Victory Song. That's not to say Twila does a bad job on these songs - her voice is beautiful; rather, these are not as good as her later efforts. Still, it's a nice listen if you're a fan of Twila's and want to hear some of her earliest music."
3,You have to be young and then you really get it.,"OK, so the movie nowadays is pretty corny, but I saw this movie for the first time when high school graduation seemed eons away and I envied those 5 young people so much. Liam Neeson gives the movie some character I think. His first scene gives me stitches, I laugh so hard at the thought of him drunk. Julia Roberts does her part of the flirt no-brainer very well. Overall I think the movie is a fun late night thing."
2,Dull,"At least the Short-Timers introduced some interesting characters, but the ""Blooper"" is just too dull. It also feeds the fire of misinformation about the war, the VC/NVA, and the typical GI."
3,"Small & Polyester, but work","These get the job done. However, for being advertised as .270-.35 cal, the patches are very small. I'm accustomed to using larger patches for .30-cal bores, which means I typically need to use fewer of them. With these patches, I find I often use two (or sometimes three depending on the rifle) at the same time, which works well enough. Probably wouldn't purchase again because of this fact.I should have read closer, these are polyester and not cotton as I prefer (more absorbent), but that's my mistake. Wish it was explained a bit more clearly though rather than a quick bit in the item name. Oh well."
2,Mediocre,"A few (two?) of the detailed descriptions hit the mark the rest are simply distracting groupings of words that get in the way of what might have been a good plot with a twist at the end.Why every male who writes as a female has to address menstruation , I'll never know. I agree, this was tedious. Reminded me of R. Price's excruciating style. I did enjoy the ending, even wondering which transgression led to her capture..."
1,Poor Quality leads to Wasted Money,"The fabric used to connect the back to the seat portion ripped after about 2 months of use. There was no way to repair the damage, so I had to throw it in the trash. Don't waste your money."
3,Above Average Album,"The Westside Connection shocked the world in 1995 with their multiplatinum album Bow Down. Ice Cube Mack 10 and WC are west coast Hip Hop legends. Tracks like bow down, New York New York, and Gangstas Make the World Go Around are all pretty well put together tracks. Im not really that much into west coast and down south hiphop but this is well worth checking out if you already havent."
4,Fishing Fun,"This is a good game for a 3 or 4 year old. The suction cup fishing pole is used to pick up cardboard fish. You can play by either matching colors or numbers, so it reniforces color recognition for younger children and number recognition for slightly older kids. It is also a good memory game. My three-year old loves to bring this game on playdates, and she and her friends always enjoy it. The fishing pole works really well- we havent' had any problems with it.I wouldn't buy this toy for a child over 4, however, as I feel that older children would quickly become bored with it."
3,BROKE EASILY,"I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. IT TAKES SKILL TO ""CATCH"" A FISH WITH THE PLASTIC SUCTION CUP FISHING POLE. SHE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THE FISH TO STAY ON THE POLE AND LOST INTEREST QUICKLY. SOON AFTER THE FISHING POLE BROKE AND IT ENDED UP IN THE TRASH."
3,i love Silkk but i think his new album will be much better,This cd was good. But usually im not into this kind of music. His new album i believe will hit good with the people & charts alot better than this one..i love silkk he is fyne!!
2,"Poorly written, poorly organized, and boring","This book is so poorly written and poorly organized that it is almost unreadable. The author has the crew of a boat sailing by the light of a new moon (a new moon is dark), water 'avalanching' over the boat, describes a lost fishing boat as '900 feet long', has a storm- ridden boat at 'the epicenter of the storm' (look it up). A BAD BOOK."
2,SEE THE MOVIE INSTEAD,"I know, I know. Most people, myself included, would often opine ""the book was better than the movie"". Not this time, I'm sorry to say.The movie kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The book might better be used to prop UP a seat.George Clooney and Marky Mark? ""Give me a break you say""? Yeah, but it works. Who would have thunk itIt's not that Junger isn't a competent author. He's done his homework and it shows. It's just that I felt that I was too often reading the latest weather report in more detail then I cared to know about.I'm sure that many will disagree on the basis of the ""man against the sea"" cliche. If so, they might want to read (or re-read) ""The Old Man and the Sea"" or even ""Kon-Tiki"".Sorry...4 stars for the movie, but only 2 for the book."
2,Incorrect title,"I think the the title of this book should have been ""The History of New England Fishing.....And Oh Yeah, There's a Storm Too."" All of the needless information presented by Junger greatly took away from what could have been a superb book. This story could easily have been told in 20 pages. Definitely NOT a ""must read."""
2,"If it is any consolation, the movie is worse","There was a lot of technical, boring stuff that pertained to fishing boats and meteorology. What could I have expected? Still, the long passages where the intricacies of sword fishing were explained really bored me. I very much disliked the glorification that the author made of the crew members. The fact of the matter is that they were just a bunch of maladjusted men (may they rest in peace). Please do not think of the word ""hero"" when describing the crew. The only heroes were the National Guard rescue crew, because they did risk their lives in order to save others. Bobby, Billy and company were no heroes (this is the most corrupted word in today's language).I did watch the movie, hoping for some color. Somehow, the storm representations did not have the same vividness in a page than on the screen. The movie has some typical Hollywood defects, like once again the prettifying of the crew, their glorious lives, etc, etc.I liked the map!"
3,The Perfect Book? No.,The Perfect Storm reads like two books:The first book is like a soap opera and follows the lives of a group of doomed fishermen who lead nomadic lives that go something like this: Fish...party....fish...drink...fight...fish..divorce...fish..etc.The second book is a exciting tense tale of courage and loss. The helicopter rescue attempt and subsequent ditching is great story telling. The author's narrative of the building storm is impressive. How anyone survived is almost beyond belief.The author interweaves these two accounts. One leaves you with a sense of awe and tragedy. The other is bound to be a made for tv mini-series.
3,"Held my interest (for the most part), but somewhat technical","I'll be brief, as other reviewers have covered the basic plot and style info. In short, if you like a good disaster book, this is one you'll enjoy. My one warning is this: be prepared to encounter a fair amount of technical nautical and fishing jargon. If you either A.) have never lived on the east coast or B.) know next to nothing about fishing other than how to wrestle an earthworm onto a hook and a fish off of one, then you may have to seek the dictionary and/or other resources to fully understand some passages. Otherwise, the book was an interesting and sometimes gripping slice-of-life/disaster tragedy read. I learned a lot about the east coast swordfishing and ""PJ"" cultures, ocean storm behavior, and more. I recommend it."
2,Re-read Joseph Conrad,"""Perfect Storm"" a tragic tale simply told with little visceral impact. For style, character development and visceral contrast re-read Joseph Conrad's short stories: ""Nigger of the Narcissus"" and ""Typhoon."" Most of the four and five star reviewers will drop their scores . . . I bet."
3,"Good story, poor writing","I thought the overall ""story"" of this book was intriguing, however, the poor writing ruined it for me. I'm not sure whether Sebastian Junger used ""Dick and Jane"" senetences so that the world as a whole would understand, or maybe this is just how he writes, but either way, his lack of parallel sentence structure and overbundance of sentence fragments diminished his credibility as an author."
2,"Tried to read,tried to listen,still a long newspaper story","I read this, I listened to it ( read by Stanley Tucchi) YAWN. Besides the lovely picture of the author, I can think of no other reason to read this. It is simply a long newspaper story. This is non fiction? Seems alot of maybes, and could haves fill the story. But then I had just read Angela's Ashes and Tis. After great books like those it was hard to read this 1 dimensional thing. I think the Learning Channel's deadliest job ( crab fishing) was much more interesting."
4,Very interesting and well written!,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. I had expected a little more adventure, however, after really getting into the ""meat"" of this book, the reader realizes that it is not meant to be an adventure story. It is meant to illustrate man's struggle against nature and how sometimes we just have to let mother nature have her way becuase she is far more powerful than any ship. Junger shows this point well and drives it right home. I felt the descriptions were very good, this guy really does his homework. I particularly appreciated how much time Junger spend describing the private lives of the fishermen and the trauma their families went through back at home. It had a few flaws, however, I enjoyed the book so much none really stick out in my mind. Good job"
5,Most awesome book I have ever read & I've read alot of books,"This book by Junger is truly awesome! I read it non-stop and have recommended it to many people who have read it and said the same thing. Before reviewing an ""excerpt"" as boring, maybe one should read the entire book. Judging a book from an excerpt is akin to judging a book by its cover."
3,"Detailed, yet interesting","This is a novel of the experiences of 5 fishermen. Sebastien Junger goes into detail about the events of not only the 5 fishermen, but also of some background information, the friends and family back on land, and the experiences of 3 sailors on their way to Bermuda. I, personally, enjoyed some parts of the novel more than others. I get bored easily, and too many details can bore me. Junger goes into great detail about little and unimporant things. However, at certain points, this can be quite helpful in bringing you, the reader, into the story and actually feel what each character feels. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that really make you a part of the story through imagery, details, and related interests of yourself."
3,less than I expected,"I kept waiting for the real good part of the book, but then I was at the last page and somewhat surprised. There are no whopping thrill rides, but you do get a picture that is pretty easy to envision (credit to the writer). I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend the book in it's entirety. I did enjoy learning a brief bit about the pararescuers and their training. that was the best part of the book; the brief section which describes the storm, how it formed, and the rescuers, and how they were formed. The rest was just extra pages that made it a complete story."
3,"A times wonderful, a times ZZZZ","I began this book with great anticipation and left it with truly mixed feelings. For the average person with average interest in the fishing industry and the sea, the lenghty accounts of weather and the ocean can get exhausting. I found myslef wanting to skip over those parts and get back to the stories of the men aboard the ships trapped at sea. I think some of my enjoyment stemmed from my proximity to the area where the story took place. I left with an increased appreciation for the fishing industry. I really enjoyed the ending and I am interested to see how this story is depicted in the upcoming feature film."
3,It took a lot of effort to read this book,"A good book, but it will require effort to finish.. Since all crew memnbers died this is not a first-hand account, just speculation on what might have happened, and a bit of reconstructing their final days at home buying groceries and getting gas. Although this would be of great interest to relatives - I had to push myself through the book. As mentioned by other reviewers, much of this book doesn't deal with this ship - but rather the other efforts to save other boats also in trouble during the storm. One of those stories about a Coast Guard helicopter was exciting, and you are able to learn a fair amount about the fishing industry - but all in all I would not recommend this book to friends. (the one I gave it to returned it unread)"
4,A very good book & educational for non-sailors,"I loved this book - I was totally engrossed by it from the moment I started reading it. I'm no book critic but I think Junger did an excellent job writing this book. This book gave me respect for the ocean, weather, and the people who have to deal with both in order to make a living. This book whet my apetite for more in it's genre which I found in Caroline Alexander's book ""The Endurance : Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition"" which is the best book I've ever read."
3,not a gripping read,"Too many technical details about boats, swordfish, fishing bogged down this book for me. However, the writing is good and anyone more interested in such topics would enjoy this book more than I did."
2,An Imperfect Storm,"The history of the evolution of the methods of catching large hauls of fish was very interesting, as was the history of the fishing villages. Many of the anecdotes were amusing. But I just didn't care very much about the lives of the target crew and their hangers-on. Their lives seemed to have been lifted from an unpleasant melodrama."
4,A page turner wth a few obstacles,"Sebastian Junger takes the reader and enters him into the fishing industry of the Northeast taking him on the life ending journey of the Andrea Gail. The technical grammer is an obstacle to the intense action. When ""the storm"" arises, the pages turn without notice, but for those unfamiliar with nautical terms, reading can be upsetting. Excellent for those interested in sailing. The heart goes out to the survivors."
4,A white knuckled thriller of life on the Atlantic,"Junger, careful in detail, lays out the possibilities surrounding the final fate of several fisherman on the Atlantic. During an un-announced and unforgiving nor'easter, the crew of the Andrea Gail fight to bring in the ship and themselves alive. I was rivited to the pages and enjoyed in depth explanations of fluid dynamics, boating techniques and a disturbing description of drowning. White knuckled, I turned the pages and tried to imagine the fear everyone felt that ill fated week in 1991. Junger brings to life in words a storm I barely remember, and I was living in NJ at the time. I will remember for a long time however, those who risk losing their lives to the unforgiving Atlantic, to bring in a harvest in high demand."
3,Medium,"Sebastian Junger should of just stuck to the event that hes soposed to be writing about, which is the storm not the descreption of everypart of the boat and any other equipment, adding those descriptions just made the book tedious and boring."
2,THE PERFECT BORE,"I love books about storms. I love books about the sea. But this bored me to tears. I would much rather have heard more about the storm itself, the families and loved ones and how they were affected than the boring fishing details, and tedious descriptions. I did pass this book on to my husband and he seems to be enjoying it - it just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,Different from Movie,"If you are looking to get a story like the movie, forget it. There is a lot less ""embelishment"" than movie. goes more into the science of waves, weather and our deep sea rescue teams. Interesting read. Little slow, but you learn something. Portrays fisherman as drunkards who spend money haphazardly. I would recommend it, but expect a different ""feel"". Probably more realistic."
3,Perfect Storm,"The book was very interesting as a story goes. The wrighter did a lot of research and kept you interested the entire time.Although it was based on a true story, that is as far as it goes. I personaly knew most of the crew on that boat and knew about the rest of them and nothing much in the story has much to with any of them. True, nobody really knows what happened that day but it would have been a lot better if the author had used the facts that he got from the family and friends of the crewmembers on the boat. I would have to say the story was BASED on a true story rather than a true story."
5,Not beyond comprehention,"Being there was the feeling after the compelling story, turned the next page ,I felt each moment in the characters lives so vividly portrayed by the author. As the characters began to be introduced and their roles played out I now knew I could not comprehend why they were continuing in their designated foot steps. Sebastian Junger, drew my being into their roles and they were no longer beyond comprehention.A teaching and learning experience. A must read. JJ"
3,An amazing story cluttered with unnecessary details,"Junger provides an amazing amount of detail about the fishing industry, its practices, and the perilous voyages men undertake to reap the rewards of hauling back a major catch. However, just when Junger has you ""hooked"" and intrigued by the force of 100 foot swells and the possible demise of the crew, he falls back into bombarding you with frivolous character details. Also, Junger's fragmented, informal writing style makes what would otherwise be a weekend read, an arduous task."
4,The Perfect Storm or the Not so Perfect Storm,"The book, The Perfect Storm is a true story about a sword fishing boat that was send out in the sea late in the season, because it's last catch was not good enough. The captain was getting a hard talk from his boss because he was not pulling in as much fish as his other boats. This is where it all turns wrong. Where their normal fishing spot wasn't good enough for the amount of fish they have to catch, so they have to head out further to sea. When out at sea the ship and crew face many problems. Just as they were done and had the catch of their life time they set back home. They never saw the storm coming or shall I saw both storms coming."
5,For anybody who loves open water boating,"Awesome book. The author usues very vivid and believable descriptions of the action. Even though he wasn't there in full, he knows his stuff and did his homework. I love all of the sub plots outside of the main fishing boat. He also describes the plight of the Atlantic swordfish better than any environmentalist! A book for the generations and one of my all time favorites!"
2,Over-hyped Author,"What a disappointment after all of the so-called book reviewers went on and on about how well this book was written. The content was interesting but the writing style was mediocre. It reminded me of reading some of the papers my children wrote in grade school. I guess that any style of writing is acceptable now and I shouldn't be so disappointed but I sure was. The author should get an ""A"" for his research but I would give him a ""D+"" for his style and lack of fluidity. 2 Stars is pushing it!"
2,over-rated,"When I read critic quotes that used words like ""riveting, mesmerizing, thrilling"" and so on, I thought I might be getting a book that I could liken to Krakauer's, ""Into Thin Air,"" or something, but absolutely not! I would use none of those words to describe this book. I felt as if the author was having to fill pages with all sorts of technological data, old stories, and so forth because there was so very little of a story to tell. I think this book may very well be worthwhile to those who are vastly interested in the subject matter; for me, though it was just dull."
5,"Tragic, but fascinating - I couldn't put it down.","The book is gripping in its tale of struggles on the sea and the hardships endured by families whose lives depend on the commercial fishing industry. I was enthralled by the author's description of the history of commercial fishing in New England and his explanations of the meteorological events which lead to the tragic loss of many lives during ""The Perfect Storm"". Having once been ""lost"" in Gloucester while on a driving tour of Eastern Massachussets, I really appreciated the author's description of the local culture!"
4,enthralling story,"Quickly, this is one of my (and my wife's) favorite reads. We grew up on the New England coast, lobstering and clamming and inshore fishing, but never venturing beyond the coastline. This is the story of the regular guys who provide us our swordfish steaks and die in the process. The storytelling is quite masterful and the subject is...well, it's real life and death. How much more compelling and interesting can it be? Not much. This is a hell of book."
3,"An intensely researched, interesting read.","This isn't the kind of book I would have ever bought for myself. I received it as a gift, and thought it would be a cross between The Babe Winkleman Story and a pirate epic. Instead, it hooked me immediately with characters and plot compelling enough to be fiction. The details of what goes on behind the scenes in the fishing industry are fascinating, and just might cross your mind the next time you order up seafood."
5,My Favorite Book!,"This is the best book I've ever read. This is my favorite book! Many people do not like this book because of the endless details provided, but for me, the details are what grip me, push me to postulate and in turn, learn. This book is amazing."
3,"good beginning and end, lost steam in the middle.","Good beginning and end but lost me in the middle. When I first started this book I could not put it down, it slows down in the middle but regains momentum in the end."
4,Overall Comments,"A very interesting read, however, Junger went overboard (pardon the pun) with the fishing jargon and technical talk and that, unfortunately, kept the book from being as good as it would have been."
4,fascinating,"The author's sterile approach highlights even more fully the tragedy he describes. Rather than grip our emotions and play to our sympathies, Junger writes to our rationalism, doubling the impact of the events."
3,Hard work but not good enough..,"I bought this book because I too like true stories and novels such as this one.I hated when I had to read the story all over again when I stop a certain page. The book is just filled with facts and many things to know that as you read along you would forget what you read a chapter before.I believe Sebastian Junger wasn't so great in organizing and telling this story, but thee book really shows the hard work.Sometimes I get confused and bored but the story was a good. It's true story, but that doesn't mean all true stories have to be GREAT or SPLENDID.It still could have been written in a better way to interest the reader and to tell the story.I heard the movie was great, and I can't wait to see it.My advice is, if you saw the movie and liked it, don't bother buying the book, you won't read it unless you are willing to drag yourself reading it. No offence.But it is still a nice story to tell and I really appreciate his work.Happy reading!"
3,"Good, not great. 3.5 stars /5.","O.k., good book. Bit of a slow start. As Mr. Junger begins to describe the characters, I'm left a little confused as to where he's going. But if you keep reading, you get the point.I was hoping to get more out of the main characters of the story on the Sword boat. If I were Mr. Junger, I might have spent a little less time on this as the main theme and concentrated instead on the rescue crew from the C.G. helicopter. That was the most riveting part of the book as he described the helicopter having to ditch, and the thoughts of the crew. Definitely should have spent more time on the C.G. aspect."
2,This book is poorly written and unfocused.,"Unfortunately, the stories of the men lost at sea get lost in a quagmire of unrelated details, trivia, and imagined conversations. For the most part, the writing gets bogged down, and the point of the book is foggy. However, the descriptions of the survivors' experiences at sea are fascinating."
4,Wanting More...,"There are 3 concepts you had better be open to while reading The Perfect Storm: Drinking, Fishing and the Weather. Lucky for me, that worked out. Although I found the book to be totally enjoyable and impossible to put down, I was left wanting more. The real problem is that no one really knows what happened, when or how. Normally not a problem, but when it's a true story that hurts even more. The author did a fabulous job of putting you right there, in the middle of what must have been sheer hell. I expect the crew of the Andrea Gail to be in my thoughts for some time."
2,This Record was ingeniously titled...,"AIYO SUMTHIN'S GOIN' On!!!!!I am a big roots fan, but like i said this album was ingeniously titled because on this album things did just that, FELL APART... I felt the roots the most on Do you want more, but ever since then their albums (in my opinion) have on been a downward spiral. Perhaps I didn't like the album because i cant feel mos def. Infact I hate mos def!!!! And this album was ridden with the ridiculously monotonus style of Talib Kweli, which to me was practically unbearable... If it was any other group i would recommend that you save your money, but i am a die hard fan.(so at least try to get it on sale) Black Thought (to me) sounded extremely bored on this album and was trying too hard to make something out of nothing.. I rate this cd 2 stars... I wish i had nice things to saybut i dont, so DO YOU WANT MORE IS THE BEST ALBUM YET........"
5,...step into the realm!!...,"...they are without a doubt the most talented of all the hip-hop contingents out there right now, in the same category as mos def, outkast, common and bdp. they aint keepin it real, they keepin it right. i love this disc; it's original and old school and all about what the music should be."
5,words cannot express what a great album this is,"i believe that the date was february 23rd, for the past month or two i had done nothing but bug all my friends about what was going to happen february 23rd, and when the day finally came i left the school parking lot as quick as possible and broke speed barriers to get to my local music store. when i left and anxiously slipped the cd into my pioneer i was far from dissappointed. Things Fall Apart is simply the best hip hop cd in years. from the intro all the way to the hidden track, it is top notch hip hop. u can just tell by listening to the lyrics and the thought that the music is being played with (god forbid) live instruments that a lot of hard work went into making this album, and we, the fans, have been so generously awarded."
4,Good,I thought I would end up hating this cd because I thought it would be like Pras or something...but it is good. The beat is good and easy to groove to and just listen. My favorite song so far is You got me with Erykah Badu
5,A Blueprint for Life,"This book has given me direction and purpose, in the same way as On-Star gets you to the Palm or Morton's. I was as useless as a WNBA 4th round pick, but this book has helped me:- Get my daughter into a quasi-respectable college in upstate N.Y. where she'll sleep until noon and spend my money.- Fool other people into believing I'm only mildly terrible at golf instead of grotesquely excrable.- Respond to my fellow human beings the Tony way: by hurling personal insults based on physical appearance.You too can turn your life into a paradise of shameless promotion and crass, misguided opinions. Read this book, for Denis' sake!"
3,CLAH-SIC???,"Isn't it cheaper to just listen to Tony, Andy, and the bunch on espnradio.com or watch PTI?"
1,this book stinks. tk is a geeze bag,"this book stinks. tk stinks. the geeze bag should skip my show, grab a denny's early bird special and hit the sack by 6 pm. 3:30 dinners are classic."
5,Caped crusader cashes in!,"Mane flowing, cape blowing, Sir Toby dashes through the night as the Orange Avenger!BEHOLD...his otherworldly ability to drive his horseless sleigh backwards!WITNESS...our hero consume mass tonnage of product!SUCCUMB...to shameless promotion!"
1,don't waste your money,This jar only lasted a few weeks before it cracked and fell apart. Save your money and buy Osters stainless steel jar instead
2,"Very, very, very basic","Honestly, the information contained in this single page folded ""flyer""...it's not an 8 page ""paperback"" as described...could be found in greater detail online with a simple Google search. I feel a little embarrassed for forking over $3.50 for it. I would have never purchased it if I had picked it up at the store and it could easily be mistaken for one of those ""take one"" flyers you see stacks of in retail stores. I could easily type the entire contents of the flyer in this review in about 10 minutes. I'll give it two stars because it is in a handy format and if you are COMPLETELY unfamiliar with basketball it might come in useful. Be warned though, I THOUGHT I was pretty clueless about basketball...but if you've been to even a few games, this book is way, way, way too basic."
2,Passable,"Great playing, crappy songs. Jimi had only handful of good songs. Too bad he wasn't as good a songwriter as he was a musician, so his playing could be placed within an enjoyable framework."
5,GREAT LIVE RECORDING,IT SHOWS A MATURING JIMI HENDRIX PLAYING MANY SONGS OTHER THAN PURPLE HAZE AND DISPLAYING NEW SOUNDS LIKE FUNK. IT IS SAD THAT JIMI NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO DISPLAY HIS MUSICAL ON A HIGH DUE TO HIS DEMISE. ENJOY THE CD!
2,"its o.k but,......","I have to agree with ""Josh Turnpike"" a previous reviewer, this collection of live performance's is nothing on ""Band Of Gypsys"", there just doesnt seem to be the energy or the cohesion within the band.I love jimi, I have all his studio albums and quite a few live one's, and I was really looking forward to hearing this, but on it's 3rd listen I just had to admit to myself that this cd was sub standard.If I had heard it in the store, and could take my time listening to longer than 30 second samples I wouldnt have bought it.By ""BAND OF GYPSYS"" instead."
5,Guitiar God of Gods,"Rolling Stone recently asked a number of lead guitarists who was the greatest/influenced them the most. The most frequent response was HENDRIX. This CD issue is amazing. First of all, it has been mastered to near perfect quality for a 30 year old tape.Secondly, Jimi played most of his music with white musicians...Band of Gypsys are three grooved black musicians and Jimi really goes to the soul and R and B roots. Personally, if I had to live my life with only one recording from the 20th century...this would be it!"
4,A Sweet Bundle of Love,I ordered a used book. The book was in new condition except for a message written in the front. I whited it out and placed a gift tag over it. I was very pleased with the condition and the timely shipping.
5,An extreme adventure,"I think Stowaway is an excellent book.It's full of adventure and drama.It's a complete journey wrapped up in a book.It's also really suspenseful because you never know what's going to happen on Nick's ,the main character,adventure!I reccomend this book to any thrill seekers.Even though It's about a boy , I'm sure any adventurous girl would love to read this book."
4,So Ye Wanna Be A Stowaway,Stowaway is a very good book. if ye like those books about the seafarin adventures and wut not. it could have done with a pirate or 2 but it's still pretty good. And ye better be good at readin if ye wanna read this. It's got big words and alot o' pages.(...)
1,Stowaway,I had to read this book for my book group in school and god it's sucks. Whenever I have to read this book I start to cry because I hate it so much. Usually books as you go get better and better but this one keeps getting worse as you go. It takes me about a minute per page but it feels like an hour per page because it is so bad. I would never ever recommend this book to any one.
3,Stowaway,"I liked the book, which was based on a true story. Although it was a diary, it was written by an author and not someone who lived the story. I thought it was great how Karen wrote a true story from a children's point of view. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Little too big,This stuff little too big for my 12 lb cat. The rim does not stay up too well and goes flat. Overall quality all right.
2,Not very effective,I needed some smaller patches for my 22 and these are just too small to be effective for cleaning the barrel because they slide right through. I would not purchase again.
5,Well made,"I needed a shelf for my cable TV receiver and DVD player which were lying on the carpet underneath the table my 40"" TV sits on. This foilled the bill perfectly and left space on the shelves for magazines and DVd's. Good, solid construction, altho like all similar products, assembly requires going slowly and reading carefully."
1,Wrong wrong wrong wrong WRONG!,"I ordered the nice light wood two shelf unit to raise a dresser of mine, and in stead, I got TWO of the WRONG model in the WRONG color. Mine had two drawrs and flimsy particle board coated in crappy black lamiate. Silly. I'd think twice before ordering from this seller..."
2,Poor Design - Breaks Too Easily,"Purchased one and it broke the day we received it. The jet engine car in the rear is motorized and pushes Thomas and the other trains around the track - essentially turning you standard wooden into a motorized one. A single fall off of the train table and the plastic portion that holds the magnet to connect to other cars broke. Learning Curve customer service was quick to ship out a replacement unit. But again, the day we received it a similar thing happened and it broke in the exact same place. I think it comes down to poor design. The jet engine is already heavy because it is metal instead of plastic, and then you add in the battery. Would be a really nice addition to the set if not for the poor design."
2,Disappointed,"We were so disappointed that the Jet Engine stopped working in less than a day. My husband stopped to pick this up for our almost 5 yo on the way home from work, by bedtime it wouldn't push."
1,"Great toy, not toddler proof","We purchased this for my son and after 2 hours of gentle play, the engine stopped working. It is not at all durable. We have the battery powered Lady, and that has worked for years, but this one didn't hold up at all."
5,A great record that surprised me,"I'm from Nashville, and I thrive on a steady diet of Prince, jazz, old school and hip-hop. I like some pop artists, like Donald Fagen, Swing Out Sister, etc. But when I heard ""Ugly Girl"" for the first time (at Blockbuster video, go figure), I was caught up by the infectious melody. I was not disappointed by the album. F & J throw everything and kitchen sink at you on this record, but it's well-paced, enjoyable, and great to listen to. From the rockin' ""I'm So Small"" to the mellow ""Rain All Day,"" this is one of the best albums of 1999. Check it out."
1,Don't Buy for Ugly Girl,"For anyone who enjoyed Fleming & John's first CD, I assume they will enjoy this one. For those who are buying this CD mainly because you enjoyed ""Ugly Girl"" and are expecting more of the same, get ready for disappointment. If you loved ""Ugly Girl"" as much as I did, buy the single and save yourself a few bucks.But decide for yourself. Listen to samples of other songs on the CD. If you like them, this CD is for you. If you listen to them and wonder, ""What the heck is that?"", skip this CD and grab the latest from Melonie Doane or Barenaked Ladies.(Most of the time, when I buy CDs based on just one hit, I find other songs on the CD I like. Not this time.)"
2,"Buy the singles, not the whole thing","Yes, Fleming does have an outstanding voice, but this CD is not that great. All those five star reviews are by people who are either friends of the band or drug addicts. ""Ugly Girl"" is by far the best song on this CD. After hearing it on the radio, I bought the CD expecting great things. What a letdown. Save yourself some money and buy the single and not the CD. Two or three other songs are somewhat listenable, but there is no way this is a five star release. If you're looking for music of this genre, stick with Sara Hickman or k.d. lang."
4,Thomas & Friends Roundhouse,"Hard to find. My 4 year old loves this toy! If you have a ""blue"" track railroad, this is a must have - It gives you a place to park five engines."
3,Decent but not exceptional,"I am happy with the piece but not thrilled. The quality is not what I have come to be accustomed to. One reviewer said assembly was easy. I did not find this to be so although it wasn't the hardest thing I have put together. It took me about 3 hours doing it all by myself. There were two rather significant cracks on the front drawer frame assembly used to attach it to the seat. I had to do some home repair to make it work since after getting the dozens of pieces out of the box I wasn't about ready to try and pack it up and send it back. There were also some slight areas of damage to the seat. Another problem was the fact that the dowel holes were drilled too large in almost every case. Applying glue to these was senseless. All said and done, it turned out very sturdy and is an attractive piece. Comfortable it is not but it looks nice nevertheless. Hope this helps you in making your decision."
1,Buyer Beware,"The information listed in the ""Product Details"" section for this book is very misleading. As noted in the other comments, this book is the paperback Student Solutions Manual. It is NOT a hardcover book and the ISBN number is not ISBN: 0130914657 (as listed in the product detail section). This book may prove to be helpful but it was not the book I thought I ordered."
5,Brand new and much cheaper than the college bookstore,This item was at least $60 cheaper than what my college bookstore wanted for it.
1,Not stable enough for books,"I never write reviews, but this product was so bad that I feel compelled to warn other prospective buyers. We purchased this bookshelf for our girls' playroom for their books. We assembled it correctly and strapped it to the wall. Even so, it is in no way stable enough to be filled with books. It quickly buckled under the effort and was a hazard for the kids. The shelves were ready to give way at any moment so we took all the books off and piled them on the floor which became a different kind of hazard. We have replaced this bookshelf with a different one now and have had to pay twice for the bad experience. I therefore write this review to let you know that this bookcase cannot be used for books. If you would like to use the bottom shelf for books and the upper two for picture frames or stuffed animals, that might work. Good luck!"
3,Nice Bookshelf for the Price!,"We purchased this bookshelf for our baby's room - it looks very nice. It's not the most durable or heavy bookshelf, but for the price, its exactly what we need for now."
1,Crappy Materials,"This bookshelf looks great online and even on the box, but once opened, it reveals a very cheap fabrication, lots of nicks and scratches, bolts that don't fit together properly, and once put together, it just looks crappy. I am returning ours, which we purchased for our baby-to-be's room. There's got to be something better out there for the money.On the other hand, KidKraft's customer service is top-notch."
1,not compatible with some systems,Watch out before buying: this card IS NOT compatible with some hardware:HP Pavilion ze 4420 USa Compaqwhereas it works fine with a PII and a AMD 600
3,"Decent part, would not buy again.","First off, this is a decent part, I just would not buy again.Arrived packaged somewhat poorly. Had a couple dents and scrapes on the tailpipe end that you see when installed. Not a big deal to most, but at the same time some people like their vehicle to look nice too.This rusted VERY quickly, more so than the OE tailpipe did after 8yrs under the truck! I would spring for the stainless in the future.Installation went ok, you must cut off one of the hangers depending which one you use. This could be troublesome for some. Even after this it was hard to get this to hang just right. It ended up moving around with driving and melted the edge of the cutout in my bumper. I guess you have to REALLY crank down the connection between this and the muffler.To sum up, this part is great for an aging vehicle as a cheap replacement. If you care about the looks of your vehicle you should look at a stainless pipe, perhaps a cat-back system would be your best bet."
1,"Very Impressive Work, for an antiquities trafficker...","I thought this book provided some interesting analysis about the opportunities in Iraq.Recent revelations that the author is a law-breaking opportunist himself, however, color my appreciation of his work. I no longer believe it to be sufficiently ""disinterested"" as a scholarly work.[...]"
2,"Very sweet, but too old","A fine product in its time, but unlike fine wine, it has not improved with age (5 years), and MS Visual Studio 2008 is now the program to use."
3,tasty,"Ok, these things are pretty tasty. The blueberry flavor is rich, but subtle. The ingredients are all organic. But let's face it, when you're energy bar shopping, you want to know how they compare to Clif bars, right? The Pure bar is 1.7oz, contains 8 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber, and 6 grams of protein. The Clif bar is 2.4oz (50% larger than the Pure bar), contains 5 grams of fat, 7 grams of fiber, and 10 grams of protein. Most, but not all, of the ingredients of the Clif bar are organic and they've added vitamins to fortify their bar. The Pure bars are about $1.57 each, while the Clif bars are about a buck. All in all, the Clif bars seem to be a better bargain, unless you feel strongly about having every ingredient be organic."
3,"Great Price, Eh Taste!","They're healthy and I found a great deal, but overall the texture is not my thing. I do like the nuts in it. I think the nuts saved the bar for me otherwise it was like a bulky, bland nutrition bar despite the presence of cherry flavor. If whet fruit leather existed, this might be it. I will not purchase this variety again, however it is edible and the taste kinda grows on you. My boyfriend liked it and he doesn't normally like healthy stuff."
3,Not too bad,"Unlike most all-natural foods that, in my opinion, tend to taste like tree bark, this one was not at all bad. However, since I tend to like bars for bigger servings of fiber vs servings of fruit and vegetables (I eat plenty of that stuff in fresh form) I still can't buy these over my favorite - Fiber One bars.That said, for what this product IS - and since most people don't eat nearly enough fruit in their diets - I liked it and would buy it again."
1,Healthy But Tasteless,"The Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is surprisingly bland. Its ingredients include a variety of ""organic"" ingredients - several different kinds of nuts, dates, blueberries, rice protein concentrate, agave nectar, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. Nothing is cooked or processed. But for all of its positive qualities, I could only eat one bite before throwing the rest away. Unfortunately, the blueberry flavor is only minimal. It was like eating soggy, mushy mixed nuts without salt. Though it seems healthy for you, I can't recommend this product based on its taste and consistency."
3,Reminds me of fruitcake,"Pure bars have a dense, oily consistency, similar to fruitcake. I'm not crazy about the taste, though they would be great to have on hand when hiking or when in need of an energy boost. The ingredients are healthy, but 190 calories is a little on the high side for my mid-day snack. I would probably not buy these...I would rather eat fruitcake."
2,I would worry about the other products made in the factory,"On the package it states what other types of food items are processed in the same facility. If I was vegan, it would worry me that this raw fruit and nut bar was made in a place where they process fish.The taste was nothing to write home about, it tasted like a badly artifically flavored blueberry muffin and the texture was not very enjoyable. I guess if I was starving I might be able to eat the whole bar, but I was able to eat less than half of it and kept trying to give the rest to my son.I think the product page needs to be updated to reflect what other food items are processed in the facility, I misplaced the package, but if I remember correctly they included: milk, soy, peanuts, and fish. I think buyers should be able to know what else is processed there, so they can make an informed decision before buying this product"
2,Yuck - it does not taste very good.,"I gave this bar two stars instead of one because it did not make me sick. However, it does not taste very good. It has a sort of mealy consistency. The cashew and cherry flavors come through. It is not excessively sweet. I ate one for breakfast and found it moderately filling. The ingredients, of course, are excellent, but they are also found in actual food.There are so many good-tasting bars out there - such asLUNA: Nutz Over Chocolate Bar: 15 CountorAtkins Day Break Bars, Cranberry Almond, 1.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15), that this would not be the one I reach for on the grocery store shelf. If I was starving to death, though, this bar would come in handy."
4,Blu-Bar,"There is no question that I absolutely love the taste of Pure Bars Organic snack bars. They are absolutely very tasty. Too bad they honestly cost a lot of money though. I enjoyed their Cheery Cashew recently, and my mouth couldn't stop enjoying every moment of life. I just tried their Organic Wild Blueberry, and honestly it isn't so bad, but I honestly wished that there could've been a bit more blueberry to taste in the bar. Nevertheless, it still is better than one of the other snacks that are sometimes a bit more fattening for your soul.Price: BTaste: B 1/2-Overall: B 1/2-"
2,Kind of yucky,"I'm a raw food person, and when I tried this bar, it tasted pretty yucky - kind of cardboard-y! Not much flavor, and the texture of big soggy walnuts. It's not very big either, but has 190 calories in each bar! It looks like it has a lot of nutritious stuff in it, but if I'm going to take in 190 calories as a snack, I want something yummy and filling! If you don't mind making your own bars, the best I've had are from a recipe in Matthew Kenney's Everyday Raw."
3,"Tasty, healthy, overly organic snack bar","The blueberry Pure organic bar was delicious. It's a very moist bar as it is packed with plenty of fruit and nuts, which made it very easy to eat. While I'm not particularly into organic foods and the fad surrounding it, somebody who is will probably go ga-ga for this bar, whose package lists these ingredients: ""Certified Organic Ingredients: Organic dates, organic cashews, organic walnuts, organic rice protein concentrate, organic wild blueberries (with organic apple concentrates and organic sunflower oil), organic agave nectar, organic almonds, organic lemon juice concentrate, organic blueberry flavor and that's all!"" Well, okay then. To be honest, I couldn't identify each nut because the moistness of the bar won out over the crunchiness of the individual nuts. Overall, the bar was satisfying enough, but I am not sure if it's worth it to consume 190 calories (with 70 calories of fat) from this tiny bar. It's good but not great."
4,rather tasty,"I have to start off by saying this was not quite what I expected it to be. I thought it would be super nutty, sort of trail-mix-in-a-bar type thing; I'm glad it wasn't! The texture is a bit hard to describe, chewy and moist, not nutty but more like a solid bar of pureed fruit. I remember thinking it was quite a bit like the inside of a Fig Newton, both in looks and texture, though maybe a bit chewier. I didn't pick up on any particularly nutty flavors and didn't see any huge chunks of nuts in my bar, which I sort of liked because it seems like there are enough of those chunky, crunchy granola bars on the market. I would pick up this bar if I saw it at the store and wanted to have something on hand that is quick to eat, yet filling enough to last for a few hours, and isn't packed full of preservatives and chemical ingredients that I can't pronounce."
2,Kind of blah,"This bar didn't taste terrible, but it didn't taste good, either. Just kind of blah. I split it with a friend, and all she could taste was sweetness with some cherry flavor, and all I could taste was a faint cashew flavor. If you're looking for a benign organic option, high in calories (190 for a small bar), give this a try. If you're looking for something higher in protein and more flavorful, look elsewhere."
4,packed,"with all sorts of things that I'm sure are good for you in moderation. Is it PURE? Don't know about that but it did fill me up instead of eating a candy bar. And, it lasted for around 3 hours.I will buy this again as it's perfect to keep in the car, book bag or purse. No chocolate to melt into the side of the package. Packed full of energy, calories and protein."
3,"Not too sweet, but not too blueberry, either","For bars like this, the nutrition can take precedence over taste. Not so in this case. While the numbers all look good (190 Calories / 3g Fiber / 0mg Sodium) the flavor is also up there.It has a definite sweetness that makes it a great snack or breakfast bar. It doesn't have the cardboard or dryness that a lot of other healthy bars can have. I can see even children being willing to consume this as a health snack alternative.The only thing keeping me from giving it a higher rating is that there really wasn't that much of a blueberry flavor to the bar. After I finished it, I noticed the first ingredient was 'Organic Dates'. That is really what the bar tastes like. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't a blueberry bar."
3,"Not loving it, but a quality product.","Well, this is a tough one. The ingredients list is stellar, if you can forgive that the primary ingredient in this product is neither cherries nor cashews, but rather DATES. (Yuck). It's all stuff that's good for you and nothing that's not. I think gluten- and dairy-free. The consistency is moist and chewy, though stickier than I like.I am more of a cereal bar type gal. I want a little flour in there somewhere to create a cakiness. This thing was like mashed-up dried fruit molded into a bar shape, with some soggy nuts rolled in for good measure. It had that sickly-sweet raisiny taste that some people enjoy, myself not among them.While I personally would never buy these again, I give them 3 stars for being a really quality product. I am sure lots of people would like these, but they're just simply not my cup of tea."
3,"decent, but not great","The texture of this cherry cashew PURE bar is similar to the packaged brownies you can find in convenience stores. It is very dense and quite moist. I am always looking for new gluten free snacks, so I was happy to come across this bar. The taste, however, is not what I'd hoped for. While it is not terrible, I don't see myself buying this flavor of PURE bar in the future. I like the crunchy nuts, but the overly sweet cherry flavor is too much for me. The bar is sweetened with agave, and I think it might taste better with half the amount included."
3,If trail mix is too much trouble,"This PURE bar contains nuts, fruit and berries, and also a little flavoring/sweetening. It is vegan and kosher, and only 190 calories, so would make a good quick snack. When purchased in bulk from Amazon it costs about $1.65, and while there's nothing wrong with this bar, I would suggest that combining nuts with dried fruit and berries to make trail mix would be more economical and also environmentally correct, as the PURE bar comes in a wrapper which has to be disposed of."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,Overall this product appears to be healthy. I just did not care for the taste or consistency of the bar.
2,Processed Sugar Girl,"Maybe I was raised on too many processed sugars and prepackaged food but it seems the more ""natural"" things get, the more they tend to taste like cardboard. Needless to say, I was not a big fan of this product."
2,SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!,"Well now, here we have yet another healthy bar to snack on, but unfortunately this bar has very little taste and what taste it does have is nothing I would want to eat. I'm all for healthy eating, but we live only once and I prefer to eat something that taste good. It has the consistency of a fruit roll up without being very sweet. The bar has an slightly sour taste and the nuts are soft(yuck!). There are numerous better tasting bars on the market that are healthy so as a food source this would only be eaten if all other food disappeared off the planet!"
3,Just OK,"This bar is just ""OK."" The plus side is that it is organic (and raw fruit and nut, if you are eating healthy). But the fact remains the taste isn't remarkable. For a high priced fruit bar I expect more.Also an approximate 3 inch bar is 190 calories. Calories that would be better utilized by trail mix or a bowl of cereal. If you are carrying a snack, I recommend Quaker ""Oatmeal to Go"".It is a fraction of the price, though not organic and is still healthy."
4,"Good bar, but high calorie","This bar is a blend of chopped nuts, rice protein and mashed blueberries, with agave nectar providing the sweetener (fructose). It tastes better than bars based on grains, but this also means it's 190 calories per 1.7oz bar (for comparison, a can of regular soda is 130). Flavor is pretty good, texture is OK, appearance is so-so. Good if you want to get away from the typical oat-and-sugar bar."
2,"Too chewey, not enough flavor",These bars are a bit small for the price and I found them to be way too chewey for my pleasure. I shared this bar with my boyfriend - both of us eat different types of food bars during the day - and neither of us would buy this again. The flavor was lacking and the texture was too dense.
2,Tastes Like Old Nuts :(,"Aw. I really wanted to like this raw fruit & nut bar because a raw food bar is such a great concept. But the bar tasted mainly like old nuts and vitamins. There aren't added vitamins in the ingredients, but that's still what I tasted. The fruits (dates and cherries) make the bar medium-sweet. But I certainly wouldn't guess that this was a cherry-flavored bar. I think this might be a better bar with a different combination of FRESH nuts (maybe minus walnuts, plus macadamias to add to the almonds and cashews in it) and with better quality fruit. I would have preferred a stronger cherry taste, but I really only got a faint figgy taste from it. I imagine I'll be steering clear of this brand in the future."
4,this is the good stuff!,"This is the third organic, raw, much-healthier-than-thou bar that I have tried. And guess what? This one tastes good! The cherries are a little sour, adding a nice piquancy to the taste. The cashews are crunchy and delicious. Still has the problem of 190 calories in a three bite sized bar,and 17 (count 'em!) grams of sugar. The sugar is demurred as ""Natural Fruit Sugars"" but guess what folks, sugars is sugars. Lots of fat as well (70 of the 190 total). However, they are tasty and would be a nice treat on a long hike, or during some other high calorie-burning activity. Or better yet, in your Earthquake Preparedness Kit."
4,"Hint of Blueberry for 190 Calories, 70 Fat, 19g Sugar, 6g Protein, 3g Fiber:","Date and Nut bars are becoming common.Cliff, Lara bars, Pure, and many smaller companies are making similar items.All have roughly 200 calories, and 11 to 20 grams of sugar.I prefer the Lara Bars since most of them are not as sweet as this Pure Organic bar was.The hint of Blue Berry in this bar is unique.The nuts provide a satisfying crunch.Live Strong does not have the nutritional information on this yet."
3,Pretty tasty,"I am not one to normally eat energy bars or fruit bars. With that said, I did find this bar to be pretty tasty. The cherry and cashew combo left me satisfied. It's nice to have something like this to stow away in your car or purse for something quick to eat when you need some energy"
4,Perfect Midmorning Snack,"This is my second Pure Bar flavor I've tried. It primarily tastes like cherry with just a hint of cashew. I'm more of a blueberry fan, so if I was going to eat another Pure Bar, I would go with the Blueberry that is a little more balanced. Otherwise, I found this Cherry bar tasted fine, with a balance of chew more like a fruit bar than any kind of granola bar."
3,Just OK for me,"One can't contest the wholesomeness of the ingredients, the pure intent of the concept, or the desirability of organic. Yet, no matter how high the standards, the bottom line for this consumer is taste. The Pure organic cherry cashew bar is heavy, dense, and soft like a heavy brownie. It's not overly sweet, and a generous amount of nuts is evident to the eye and to the palate. This is actually a very satisfying bar that I think could, at least temporarily, allay one's hunger. But what about the taste?If you like marachino cherries, cherry ice cream or chocolate covered cherries, you may totally enjoy this bar. Unfortunately I don't care for any of the aforementioned snacks and thus find the taste of the cherry cashew bar merely OK and a little too cherry sour for my liking. I am looking forward to trying another flavor of the PURE line of bars because I do like the concept of their creator Veronica."
2,not a fan of walnuts,"I know it's probably my fault for focusing on the ""blueberry"" vs. the ""nut"" on the label of the Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Fruit & Nut bar, but it definitely didn't meet my expectations. The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts. They're the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews, but tastewise they take over. I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed. At 190 calories for the bar, they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw. I wish I liked the flavor better."
3,"Tasty, chewy, filling","Our family has enjoyed the Lara Bar line of nutritional snack bars, and the Pure bars are similar to them -- ""raw"" food that is essentially pureed fruit and nuts. Since we deal with Celiac in our family, finding a gluten-free snack bar that has no added sugar is a plus -- most snack bars contain gluten and are loaded with sugar. Here, as with the Lara Bars, the sweetness comes from pureed dates, and the Pure bars contain agave, a ""natural"" sweetener. The Cherry Cashew is a bit tart, which livens up the taste of the chewy bar. We did a taste test and four out of five gave the bar a thumbs up. The one who didn't like the bar also dislikes the Lara Bars and finds the taste a little off and too heavy for her. I personally thought the bar tasted OK, but not great -- there is something about that pureed date/agave taste that I don't love."
3,Perfectly edible,"I like to snack on energy or protein bars before going to the gym after work. The protein bars in particular are for the most part quite gross, so I was looking forward to trying these purportedly healthy and hopefully decent-tasting bars. The taste is not bad. The bars are very sweet, and do taste vaguely of blue berries. The appearance and texture is unappetizing though - little bits of nuts and fruit are suspended in a gooey chewy base, which is colored an unappealing brown.At 1.7 ounces this bar is not very substantial. It would make a good light snack, but I still felt hungry afterward. Despite the weird appearance and texture, this bar was perfectly edible, unlike some of its competitors."
4,Tastes Good and Healthy Too,"I've eaten dozens of different food bars over the years. I mainly eat them at work when I can't easily make something because they are very easy to bring along and have when I'm hungry. I like how these bars taste and I also like that all of the ingredients are not only organic, but also good for you. The consistency is somewhat like a banana with nuts in it, so this is not a very hard bar, but the nuts to give it a little crunchiness which is nice. There is also a decent amount of protien in fiber which I like to have in the bars I eat. All-in-all this bar will likely stay in my rotation at least until I get tired of it or find something I like better."
4,Pure Morning Goodness,"I have a hard time eating breakfast. The experts say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but I still was never a big fan of the morning meal...until I discovered Pure Bar. I eat either this bar or another brand with nuts, seeds and fruits with a glass of orange/carrot juice. I highly recommend Pure Bar Blueberry and Cherry. Yum!"
5,Simply great!,"When I saw ""Brownie Bar,"" I wondered what kind of flour it had, since it is also listed as gluten free. There is no flour. Yet you'd think you were eating a chewy brownie. Nutritionally it's very good without the use of anything artificial. While I rated another gluten free bar a very high ""4,"" I'd have to give this one a full ""5"" rating. One very slight caution: I have not personally experienced this, but my wife noticed that these tended to produce some ""lower GI"" problems for her - kind of a laxative effect, to be polite. I've personally not had any difficulties, so we'll continue to order them for me. I can see where the ingredients might possibly cause such an effect in some, but doubt it would be an issue for most people. And I can also say that she was quite disappointed at her reaction to the bars because she loved them! I try to reserve a ""5"" rating for the best of the best, and this product gets the full ""5."""
3,Better than the cherry,"The Pure Cherry organic bar was OK, but the blueberry...in the terms of Willy Wonka... taste like real blueberry. I found this bar much better than the its cherry relative."
2,Not a fan of the texture & needs more blueberries for sure,I wasn't a big fan of this bar. I probably still have a taste for SAD diet foods though I've only been eating raw for a month. I didn't care for the texture and in my opinon there aren't nearly enough blueberries either. I love the texture of the blueberry Larabar and it tastes SO much better...to bad the Larabar isn't raw!
3,Not what I was expecting,"Personally, I like a ""regular"" granola bar much better. This doesn't look appetizing. . .and quite frankly, it doesn't taste all that good. Perhaps this is just too ""sophisticated"" for me. It sounds so good, but it's just kind of ""yucky"" in your mouth and you want to swallow as soon as possible."
3,Blueberry and cashews - where's the flavor?,"I know blueberry has a subtle flavor but I've had nutrition bars where you can taste the blueberry. I wanted to try a cashew snack bar since it would be a great change from granola. This bar is moist, not sweet and has a nutty texture, but the nuts do not taste like cashews.The label indicates it also includes dates, almonds, and walnuts. That's where the flavor and slightly bitter aftertaste comes from. Since I'm allergic to almonds I would not try these bars again. It's too bad that information is not included along with the mention of cashew and blueberry. If you like the taste of dates you may like this bar, but I was not impressed."
4,Not bad at all!.,"These taste pretty good, especially as compared to the Fruition bars. They have a nice sweetness that is not overwhelming. They taste like blueberries and have little purple spheres that I took to actually be blueberries in them. They also have big chunks of nuts, and an agreeable texture. They are gluten-free which is a plus because the Princess of Noirs has developed a wheat sensitivity. I'd buy these if they were on sale. Only drawbacks are that they have a lot of calories for a little snack bar (190 calories, in a 1.7 oz bar), a comparatively large amount of fat (70 calories of the 190 total) and a lot of sugar (9 grams). The fat and sugar are probably why I like them. Ha! I'm just a born and bred American. Anyway. These get the thumbs up."
3,Filling but not satisfying bar.,"For something labeled ""Wild Blueberry"" I can't taste much blueberry. I'm rather disappointed about that. I can taste more of the dates and nuts that are the first 3 ingredients in the bar. It's not bad, really, but not what I expected from the package. I like the crunchy texture all the nuts give to the bar...gives it a bit of variety.It's a filling little bar. I wouldn't eat it for the flavor, which is pretty bland, and at $30 for a dozen bars ($23 + $7.95 shipping at the time I write this) it's pretty pricey. Like a previous reviewer said, I'd rather eat a handful of actual fruits and nuts than this bar, but for a snack at least this is healthier than candy bars or potato chips."
4,"Great taste which makes you reach for another bar, which is bad!!","This is a great-tasting bar. Wildberries are very sweet, but not too sweet. It has 190 calories and nutritional content similar to Zone bars. However, I felt a bit more full while chewing on a Zone Bar. Oddly enough I think its because Zone bars require more chewing and Pure Bars are very soft and delicate and you can finish them rather quickly. Obviously the more chewing you do, the longer it takes you to finish the bar and by the time you ate one, your brain already told your stomach that it has something inside. Therefore, I find Pure Bars to be more addicting and would eat them more as a snack, rather than a meal replacement bar."
1,Yuck,"I received one small bar through the Vine program. Opening the wrapper revealed an ugly looking brown mess. Throwing caution to the wind I took a bite. It tasted like I was eating a piece of cardboard with a barely detectable blueberry hint. This horrible tasting thing has 190 calories and a whole bushel of fat. No way could I take another bite. This ugly, calorie laden and fat enhanced glob is resting comfortably in my garbage can. Don't believe the hype."
3,Disappointed,"I have been looking for a bar that tastes good and is low in sugar. Since there wasn't supposed to be refined sugar in these, I thought it might work. All of them have 16g of sugar, except the dark chocolate berry bar, which has 17g. Looking at the ingredients, just about everything provides some sugar, even if it isn't refined sugar. Lots of fruit, which I expected, but is agave nectar really needed as an ingredient for all of them? Some have it for the second ingredient. After a quick internet search, I found this statement, with lots of information to back it up: ""Agave nectar is bad for you. It's not traditional, not natural, highly refined, and contains more concentrated fructose than high fructose corn syrup."" The bars all have 190 or 200 calories, and 1.7oz in weight. Lots of calories for little volume. They all have 6g of protein. I'm going to keep looking."
3,A bit too tart,"These are ok, but a bit too tart IMO.Not a knock on the product, but amazon vine promised a pack of 12, I only received one bar."
3,Wild Blueberry,"The nuts are what make this bar tolerable. The texture without them is unpleasant. I guess that's because there is no egg, flour or corn syrup used to hold it together. It reminds me of an Atkin's bar I tried once. Water to wash it down is a MUST!Certified Organic Ingredients include: Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Walnuts, Organic Rice Protein Concentrate, Organic Wild Blueberries (With Organic Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Sunflower Oil), Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds, Organic Lemon Juice Concentrate, Organic Blueberry Flavor.3 STARS: I gave the taste a 1 and added 2 stars for the healthy factor. These sound so good for you that I wish I liked them."
3,Just ok,"These aren't bad, but aren't my favorite snack bar. I wasn't terribly impresses with the flavor or the texture."
4,Pure is Premium,"The Pure Bar is a quality product. The difference between the Pure and more generic snack bars is more than just the good feeling you get from eating something that ""kinda does grow on trees!"" You can really tell there's good stuff in your hand.My bar wasn't overly processed so when I opened the wrapper I could see what it was made of and recognize the smell of the large blueberries in the mix. Biting into it I found a pleasing balance between a chewy consistency and the texture of the various ingredients.I was pretty hungry and at a low ebb in my afternoon when I had my first and while of course I got no big energy boost, the rumbling in my gut was silenced straight through until dinner and I made it through a long day at work without further complaint.Pure Bars are a feel-good snack that makes you feel good. I'm all smiles."
3,Its too sweet,"It tastes okay and I like that it's bigger than a lava bar, but lava bars tastes better in my opinion."
2,Nutrigrain bars may be better,"I like my wholegrain organic bars as much as the next guy, but this bar, and the other one did not impress me. Organic is bandied about,but it does not always mean tastes good. I prefer fiber one bars, nutrigrain bars, and even planter's peanut bars over this. Low on flavor, low on texture, and at the end of the day do we really need another bar? I hope they find traction, but I was underwhelmed."
3,"Decent snack bar, sort of high price.","My family takes a lot of fruit and granola bars for snacks. My husband is a teacher and carries a couple in his briefcase for when he needs a quick pick me up and both kids take one for a morning snack. We all like chewy bars so this seemed right up our alley.The flavor was pretty good. If you are looking for a chewy snack though, this might not be your thing. The fruit bits were chewy enough but the rest of the bar was like a soft cookie.What turns me off entirely to this product is the price. For what's listed as the normal price, I would expect to pay for a power bar that is about twice the size of this healthy snack.I'm afraid my family is going to be staying with standard granola bars for now. While they may not boast all the nutrition of Pure Bar Organic snacks they are a lot more affordable when you are going through 12 of them a week."
2,If Organic is a must,"This might have been the most unpolluted nutrition bar I have ever eaten, but it wasn't delicious. It offers a nutty feel, subtle fruity flavor, and 8 grams of fat and 19 grams of sugar that barely translate into taste. If organic is what you seek primarily then this might be just what you were looking for. Your mouth might even be acquainted with it. I would prefer a Zone Bar for the same calories."
4,"Tastes good, healthy",A great snack that has a good blueberry flavor and has healthy ingredients. A great on-the-go snack.
5,Wonderful!,"I was a bit hesitant when I unwrapped the bar since, at first glance, it doesn't look all that appetizing. Just a dark slab that doesn't inspire much confidence. But, one bite and I was sold - this tastes great! Very fresh, sweet but not cloying, soft and chewy with the nuts adding some crunch. Perfect mid day or late day snack.My only small complaint is that the bar is sticky to the touch, which can make it a bit messy if you're eating it on the go and don't have a napkin (preferably a wet nap) handy. Minor issue when compared with the benefits."
3,This is Good for You!,"This Raw Fruit & Nut Bar is certified organic, gluten-free, a full serving of fruit, it's raw, vegan, etc. etc. The flavor I received was Wild Blueberry. Now, what I didn't realize is that the bar's first ingredient on the ingredients listing is Organic Dates. Just the sound of ""organic dates"" makes me not like the bar.Sorry folks, I think this just tastes like bland nuts, cardboard, and a hint of blueberry flavor. However, it gets three SOLID stars because it is clearly organic, natural, raw, and good for you. If you're into this sort of thing I WHOLE-HEARTEDLY recommend it.It contains cashews, walnuts, almonds, and is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish, and tree nuts (all according to the product label).Go for it! Give it a try. Why not?!"
5,Awesome!,"I was a bit skeptical about the ""raw food"" bar, but I'm glad I tried it. Since I'm allergic to dairy, I don't eat many packaged food bars--which actually means my standards are probably a bit high, since I'm comparing them to ""real food,"" not generic snack bars.That said, I was actually thrilled with this, and may buy more. Both this and the cherry cashew flavor I tried were delicious and filling, although I personally like this blueberry one a little better. The texture was smooth, not crunchy--considerably denser than a fig newton, but more like that than like anything else I could compare it to. I don't know if the raw food, vegan, etc., labels are truly healthier than the alternatives or not, but I'll vouch for this being tastier than comparable items I've tried (limited sample, though) and filling."
3,Healthy? Yes. Tasty? Not so much.,"I have tried quite a few bars of this type; where the product is extremely good for you and has all natural ingredients. So far none of them have passed the taste test and in my opinion this bar is no different. The package was a little difficult to open and required a bit of extra effort. Once open the smell, texture and appeal of the bar was not too appetizing. I split my the bar with my daughter who is twelve and is a very healthy eater. She DID eat it all, but said she wouldn't try it again due to the taste and smell. My experience was slightly more positive. After the first bite or so the taste grew on me, but never got to the point where I would be excited to open another one other than to force it down as a healthy alternative to candy or some other demerit snack. Overall, this is a healthy product that may appeal to certain people. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again."
3,A healthy treat!,"I am a huge fan of this product, but only the Cherry Cashew flavor. I tried the Wild Blueberry and it did not taste near as good as the former. It's still much better than much of the junk that passes as nutritional bars so that is why I give it three stars. Does not taste like cardboard/sawdust and really reflects it's classification as a raw fruit and nut bar. 6 grams of protein on this one versus 7 grams for the Cherry Cashew and they both have 190 calories. This is a great in between meals snack and I can only speak for myself but I'd stay away from this flavor and try Cherry Cashew."
3,"spends fast,pricey","do not expect from this to get super big and ripped muscles.this is just extra protein to support body.i do not recommend mixing it with protein powders,that way your container will be empty in no time.i just take 4-8 pumps before bed to keep my body anabolic overnight.and yes,it does have taste and smell of egg whites but just that little that you can barely feel it.i cant afford to drink tons of this,and just because i use it so little will buy it again."
4,Great Reference Book,"This book is full of information about all of the ""big words"" and labels that are used to describe the hurt children involved in older child adoptions. The process and journey of the children are described with specific examples to give you an almost first hand look at various explanations for the children's challenges behavioral and otherwise. I recommend this book to all those potential parents of adopted children. I would, however, recommend reading ""Our Own"" by Trish Maskew before you read Keck and Kupecky's book. Keck and Kupecky, while extremely informative, may scare potential parents into changing their mind. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book. However, as I was reading, I remarked to my husband that I was glad I read this book second, because I would have been scared into thinking we would not be able to handle all the challenges Keck and Kupecky wrote about. I will surely keep this book handy when reading referrals once we reach that part of our journey."
5,I really like this book!,This book was very helpful. It helped me even though I haven't ever adopted. It helped me understand hurting kids more. I will buy this book! I would like to adopt older kids when I'm married. Besides I have known several foster/adopted kids. It helped me understand them.
4,Can't Wait For The Fourth Installment,I read this book within three days and it's a good book to buy. The first two of course were great but this one was better. Anne Percy is becoming the hottie of Cali and seems as though some might try to knock that away from her.
5,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Greatest seris u will ever read, read sosososos many books and none of them beat this seris....... Totally awsome, liek Gossip Girl, but better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)) i cant wait for the 5th one to come out......"
4,A Wonderful Trip Down Memory Lane,"I was stationed with the U.S. Navy at the Rodman Naval Station at the Pacific end of the canal from 1979-1981 and have been through the canal many times. I was there when the Canal Zone was disestablished (and there really WERE t-shirts!) Anyway, this video was a delightful trip down memory lane. There was some good explanations of things I'd always heard about (such as the ubiquitous rockslides at Culebra Cut as well as those old silver and gold bathrooms). The photography was great and the explanations clear.Of course, the video is dated now. Panama has full control of the canal. Aside from the canal itself, Panama has a tremendous ""industry"" of eco-tourism. A new section of canal is being built to accomodate much larger vessels, but these are subjects for the next film. Still, get this one and watch it for yourself."
5,Tri Color inkjet print cartridge,I like this product because it is the best to use with my printer. Generic cartridges dont work as well.
1,not worth it at ANY price,"Pure crap. It's not an HP unit. Maybe I read it wrong, maybe I was mis-lead.... not sure. Lousy print quality, verging on un-usable. It will make a few decent B&W;'s, then take a dump in your printer and spew feces out.Just stay away."
3,"Great ink, but...not enough of it","The ink works very well, I just object to HP only putting 15 ml (that's a tablesppon) of ink in this. It goes way too fast. The cartridges are cheaper, but I'm sure I'll end up spending more. Why are they cheaper. Certainly the plastic casing costs more than the actual ink. I really hate paying for a printer over and over again by my ink purchases. Since I got this printer for free,!I'll use it for awhile and then probably switch to Canon or Epsom. This is probably my last HP printer and all because of their cartridges"
3,Ink cartridge,"What is there to say, its ink. I didn't feel like I got the most out of them, they seemed to empty too quickly."
2,Up keep on TV very pricey,We have owned this TV for 9 months now and JVC repair man just left my house. When I bought this TV I asked the sales people and the JVC rep at the store how long the lamp would work for before it needs to be replaced. No one knew. So today when the repair man was here I asked why my lamp went out so soon. He told me that the life span of the lamp is around 2000 hrs. Thank goodness my Tv was in storage for 3 months. Or it would only last 6 months. So as you can see to watch my Tv when I want I'll have to pay $400.00 dollars a year in up keep. I wish someone printed those specs before purchasing.
3,Just for whom is real interested in Applegate's work,"This booklet it's only a brief collections of hints extrapolated by the books of Col.Applegate. It's a promotion for the Applegate/Fairbarn's combat knife too. No use for the beginner, no use for the expert, just a bit of history."
5,Cornerstone Book about Knife Fighting,"I don't think any of these other reviewers have a clue about real knife fighting considering the content of this book. Unless they are reviewing a different book???This is a no non-sense guide to using a knife to kill, either defense or offense by none other than REX APPLEGATE!Your going to get cut and your not going to use some dumb asian martial arts fooey.40 pages is way more then enough to explain how to best kill with a knife.I took MCMAP in the Marines and we used these techniques because they are proven and the most effective in combat.The reason it uses the Faibarne commando knife is because it is supperior and will have an advantage over ANY other knife or system. Why complain?There are no butts about it, kill or be killed, no fooey!"
2,A TV writer does not a novelist make,"According to the blurb, this is the debut of a TV writer and novelist.While the quality and depth of this book may well prove sufficient for TV (hardly a compliment, I'm afraid), it ultimately tanks as a novel. The characters are too one-dimensional and express themselves best in one-liners. The plot has never met a cliche it didn't like. Plot turns are too predictable. The lust story does not hold up (considering how much attention it is given).If you're traveling and desparate for reading materials between naps on the plane (as I was) this may do the trick. Otherwise, there are just too many better books out there..."
3,About what I expected,The characters are not very believable but it was about what I expected after reading the description. The author says he spent time and gleaned information from various law enforcement people but I dout he met many like the ones he portrays. It is entertaining though.
5,"""The Greatest Lesson, Love""","This book is nourishment for the sight, mind, and soul.As the story unfolds, one is taken page by page through a lush, vibrant, tapestry of visual art.As we learn or are reminded of the even more breathtaking awesome power of selfless love, our spirit is deeply magnified.I too cried. This book belongs in every home. It encompasses age, gender, and denomination."
1,Not close to the legendary account,"I was very disappointed with this film. The Japanese-animation style graphics were what was to be expected, but the content grew less legendary and extremely disappointing. This movie was terrible!!! Terribble!TEEERRRIIIBBBLLLEEE!!!!!!"
2,NOT the Disney version,"This is not the Disney film, as I thought when I bought it. The voive-overs are pretty stilted, the animation only ok quality. Mulan moves through the whoe film perpetually pissed-off--not really a children's version."
4,Cherokee replacement mirror,"Great stuff!Came in wel packed and in very good condition > new!Already fitted in my Jeep, the only thing I regreat is the fact that I was sort of misled as the advertise says power and folding, so I though it also had the motor to fold the mirror from the inside, which it doesn't. But this is a minor thing considering it is the driver's mirror. If it was the passenger one, I may have had to return it."
2,Disappointed,"I was all set to like this series because I'm a huge fan of Kelsey Grammar. I loved him as Frasier. This show is a testament to hisgreat acting skills because you never think of him as Frasier. I liked the storyline, but it's just too trashy. They need to clean itup."
2,"No redeeming social value, no likable characters","And a thin plot with too much gratuitous sex and nudity, drug-cartel type violence (truly gruesome), and nothing to like but Kelsey Grammer's acting (the other characters are so shallow that the roles don't require good acting). That's far from enough. Watched it only because there's little else to watch right now."
5,I'll never watch Frasier the same way again!,"Absolutely brilliant!! Camera, acting, editing all work together to produce one of the best dramas to come out of America in a while. Can't wait for Season Two!"
4,Too Bad the Series Ended!,"Season 1 was very good. Enjoy everything Kelsey Grammer does. Unfortunately, the series has been canceled and there will be no follow after Season 2"
5,The pride of my collection,"The Swiss army knife is an excellent product! The big one has tons of tools, and I have put it to use on several hikes, bikes and treks now. Even after 5+ years, it works excellent, all parts are shiny and ready for action! Even the wine corkscrew is excellent and works quite well. I liked the option to engrave on the knife and the pouch that came with it (it has a nice belt loop and is a big help during adventure treks!).Overall, the swiss army knife is a must have for anyone!"
3,Why is this book missing an index?,"I just received the book and THERE IS NO INDEX. The stories are well researched and filled with an abundance of information, but incongruently put together. It's nice that the table of contents indicates the regions/peoples of each chapter, but how is this a GUIDE? A guide references the ability to look up problems/solutions--this book is lacking it (ie rosemary, nervousness, Hopi, poultice, tinctures, ANYTHING--none here).The book would have received 5 stars had it had an index."
3,Two tones - different on each cuff!,"This cuff looks almost exactly like it does online. They are attractive. The pair that we were shipped however did not match. One cuff had a darker gray and one had a lighter gray. The whites were the same. Not a huge deal as probably no one who sees you wearing the cuffs would notice, but it is annoying to get something brand new that isn't quite right."
2,Poor color detail,"The color you see on the picture does not match the ones on the real item, the black label is not as dark as I expected."
3,Not Rumpole,The second autobiography wasn't as good as the first. Much repetition of the first but with much weaker writing. He tries too hard in this book to look more admirable than he probably is.
2,Interesting Read - But Reliable?,"I am sure she is preaching to the choir about her self-important life, but take it all with a grain of salt from the woman who still cannot undertand us 'normal' folk. ""I predict historians are going to be totally baffled by how the American people fell in love with [Ronald Reagan] and followed him the way we did."" - CBS News reporter Lesley Stahl, Jan. 11, 1989"
2,no encryption software,"Pros: it seems faster than the other USB hard drives I have, but that could be just my imagination.Cons: there is no encryption software included. You have to encrypt one file at a time if you want some security over your data. That is a deal breaker. I returned the item and bought a Western Digital portable drive instead. The return process with JR has been painless. Another minor issue is it takes two USB ports."
5,A quite nice external drive,"The Seagate FreeAgent Go 160GB is a quite nice external drive. To concur with other reviewers, it worked in every notebook PC I plugged it into using only the thicker power/data USB cable. The pulsating glow is also soothing during long backups.Speaking of backups, I deleted all the software that came on the drive and downloaded the free Seagate DiscWizard (it is definitely free but will run ONLY if you have at least one Seagate or Maxtor drive attached to your PC). DiscWizard is a subset of Acronis True Image that supports full hard-drive backups and online or stand-alone restores. You can also ""explore"" a backup file to see a ""virtual"" image of the hard drive at the time of the backup and, if desired, copy selected folders or files back to your system. If this URL does not work, search Google for ""Seagate DiscWizard"" - [...]"
1,Cr@ppy support & software,"After 5 attempts with the Seagate tech support to get the software to install and 6 hours later, I gave up. The tech support didn't really seem to know what they were doing and ending causing additional problems and work.The drive seems to work fine, but I would not have bought this drive knowing the included software would not work. I ended up buy Mobiliti software to get the job done.Seagate FreeAgent Go 160 GB USB External Hard Drive ST901603FGA1E1-RK"
2,needs TWO USB slots...,i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive. wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability. there's nothing convenient about its need for 2 USB slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing. nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging... if you're reading the requirements for Mac OS X you miss the bullet point in the Win XP section calling out the need for 2 free ports. Amazon's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing TWO USB ports...boooo seagate. i'm offended that you're offering such clumsy connectivity.
5,Superb Storytelling!,I WISH Pamela Kaufman would write a third book in this series! The character of Alix is so three-dimensional it is a shame to leave her this way (I'm avoiding spoilers so read the book and you will know what I mean!)
3,Not bad for a first,"Fifteen years ago I chose this off the Accelerated Reader Program to read, and by golly it was a great read for a kid who had only read comics and picture books before hand. I'd recommend it to any kid who'd want to jump from such things to prose, or an adult who wants an easy read for a bus ride"
5,EXCELLENT,"This guide provides a wealth of informationon virtually everything concerning health, nutrition,food analysis, treatment of ailments, herbology etc.I strongly recommend this book."
1,A big disappointment!,I have also bought this book for the last several years and was extremely disappointed that the TOP 44 high school profiles was deleted. That section was the major reason I enjoyed the book - to be able to know the stars of the future. I didn't buy the 2001-02 edition and probably will not in the future.
3,Signature Collection,"Very good price for the six videos in this collection. Viva Las Vegas is by far my all time favorite Elvis video. It is in regular format but the other videos are all in wide screen format. They are all entertaining movies. I would say Harem Scraem is the worst of the bunch. I had never seen it and wanted it in my collection but it's probably not one I will watch that often. I like the auto racing movies so speedway and spinout aren't too bad. Spinout is kinda wierd. When they finally get into the race, the idiot next door races better than Elvis and his rival who are supposed to be expert race car drivers. It's still a fairly entertaining race though. Not a bad buy if you get the collection for uner $20 like I did."
3,he's been like this since he was just a little boy...,"there is some really fine stuff in this. Dolores Fullers fine number Do The Clam(Dolores dated Ed Wood), Elvis in drag, and the incredible Shelley Fabares as the Elvis girl(Elvis and James Bond Bond have girls) It is terrible but like all elvis, addictive. Uncle Fester Jackie Coogan, a song that sounds like The Oldest Established in guys and Dolls(The Fort Lauderdale Chamber of Commerce)and some weird tradition called wolf call add to the cult thing. but let me tell you about my favorite moment...at the end, Elvis sings Girl Happy and for twenty glorious, rewindable seconds, Shelley busts. She just dances like Ann Margaret on crack, really good go go crack. Do you know that Mike Farrell of Mash and providence is Married to Shelley. I think he probably proposed after seeing her do these twenty seconds. It is enough to make a grown man cry."
4,easy fun read!,"quick and easy read. I finished it in one sitting. The stories are quite fascinating, some more than others, and the people behind those success stories are simply amazing. However, each of the featured stories varied greatly in depth and quality. There are quite a few great companies that are only briefly discussed in a single page and ironically, others much less well-known companies are covered in 10+ pages. So the inconsistencies are a bit of a disappointment.There are not too much insight going on here and it certainly won't inspire us to rush out and start our companies straightaway. But the important recurring theme is the founders featured here were all hard working individuals, who seized opportunities when arise, persevered and endured hardship and failures and eventually come out on top. It is also heartening to know of many women behind many big businesses that we know of today."
2,Limited,"I basically agree with the ""Lacking Insight"" reviewer. There is not much substance here. If each of these companies had a trading card, the information and backstory provided for each company would basically fit on said card.From the other review: ""The articles reminded me of something a high school student might turn in as a short essay assignment."" Bingo."
1,"No big deal , I will never paid more than 60.-$ for this watch!","Bad quality cristal, too soft, i fall down into the floor and broke the cristal and the metal band. It's imposible to me belive tha the original price could be 400.-$, NEVER."
1,Fz-180e Huge Issue,"Ok I'm gonna go be quick and sweet with it. This computer is not even Sony built. First off the thing will melt cheese it gets so darn hot. Second off If your impressed by the amazing screen you are seeing DO NOT THANK SONY. THE SCREEN IS MADE BY Samsung. Yes the sceen is made by Samsung. I found that if a chair falls on the screen it breaks. I am fixing it myself and I repeat you are buying a Samsung Screen in a Sony Name. Don't buy this computer unless you like paying more cause it says Sony or you want the Blu-Ray player. Otherwise it works as a great with the HDMI output. I have already had mine overheat and blow a harddrive, my disc drive, and my fan. Consider yourself warned. Yes, Yes, I know I am probably one of the lucky few. But if you own this and have for sometime your lieing if you say it doesnt get hot sitting on your lap. Sony told me not to use it on my lap on at a desktop station. Its called a ""Lap"" top for a reason Sony. Build em so they work."
5,Excellent book.,"This is an excellent book on fasting written by one who has truly lived out the principle in his own life. The teaching is interwoven with many stories from his personal experience, which to me is an enjoyable and riveting way to learn how God has worked in one's life. Read this book and you will be challenged to begin fasting yourself."
3,great book this will help you,i have had trouble with porn on the web i read this book and after 6 days of praying and fasting i can say that i am porn free thanks to the lord jesus not only will this book help you break sexual sins it will heal your body and see your friends come to jesus praise GOD JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY THROUGH HIS BLOOD WE ARE HIS CHILDREN
4,No complaints,"These calipers have been used more than just about any other item I've purchased for Med school. They take up minimal space and are easy to use. With a gentle touch, I've been able to use them directly on my tablet screen without any scratches. I wouldn't advise everyone to use them like that unless you know you can do it gently.There are other more expensive calipers but for distinguishing if patterns are the same across an EKG, this is really all you need."
2,not as described,"the description said it is American Diagnostic Caliper but when I received the item, it looked like a cheap version of caliper (no names or anything). im dissapointed because i would have bought the prestige one instead"
3,"book in ""ok,"" not ""good"" condition","the product had more writing in it than the description entailed. a lot underlining in pen-- the underlining isn't even straight and went over some words in many cases.had lots of ""used"" stickers on it as well (i didn't mind this that much though).i wouldn't have said the condition of the book to be ""used-good"" but rather, ""used- ok"""
2,"Watchable, yet nearly insufferably pretensious","This movie is bearable for two reasons only: Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall. They both are great actresses who create very interesting characters, but they get bogged down in a convoluted muck. Why Altman, whose 70s movies I usually enjoy, felt the need to include identity switches, overbearingly ominous music, dozens of slow pans to Greek-like paintings of rape and violence, and an unfathomable (and disappointingly tacked-on) ending is thoroughly beyond me. No, on second thought it's not BEYOND me, it's BENEATH me. I get what he was trying to do, but it's heavy handed and poorly executed. David Lynch (who I suspect was influenced by this film) has been infinitely more successful at committing ominous dream worlds to film in ""Lost Highway"", ""Mulholland Drive"", and just about every other film he's ever made."
5,"Lauren Groveman's Kitchen is passionate,creative and fun!!","It's nice to find a cookbook written with passion and creativity. This is no run-of-the-mill cookbook. It's filled with hundreds of simple, easy to use recipes written with style, wit and passion. It's actually fun to read!! And so simple to use. A beautiful book to cherish and use for years to come. MOVE OVER, MARTHA STEWART!! Lauren Groveman is the culinary creator/advisor for the new Millenium! Buy this book! It makes a great gift for everyone from Gen Xer's to Seniors!"
5,Good book for rig tuning,"Book is divided between sail trim and rig tuning. While there are a lot of sail trim books available, the section on tuning the rig is excellent."
1,Disappointing commonsense could have wrote book myself,"a guide for Older women dating younger men was a disappointing book that commonsense would have told you dos&donts.Certainly not worth the money,will sell it for [...] as the contents is all it is valued at."
4,"Common Sense, The Rights of Man and Other Essential",Witen from his personal papers. and take a while to get use to the writing and old English meaning. But overall worth reading you get and understanding that we as an early colony are having same isses today with this OBAMA admin as the colonies had back then. As they say history repeats itself.
4,text book,"This should be included in our history lessons. I wasn't the sharpest student, but they even mentioned his name. Our children are being done a huge disservice by not learning about him."
5,Another great entry,"Another great entry into the Jesse Stone series. The movie has the same measured pace, deep storyline and fine acting by Tom Selleck and his supporting cast. These movies are something you just don't see enough of anymore; adult, character-driven made for TV movies."
5,jesse stone no remorse,"THIS MOVIE IS PART 6 IN THE JESSE STONE MOVIES IF YOU LIKE TOM SELLECK AND POLICE MURDER MYSTERY THEY ARE TOP FILMS I HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE HERE IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT THESE FILMS AS YOU CAN,T GET THEM IN AUSTRALIA."
5,Great Jesse Stone film,"All of the Jesse Stone films are a treat to watch. Tom Selleck does a great job. The only negative comment I have about this series is we never see his wife, an important role in the books."
4,Dre The Great,"This used to be one of my favorite albums and its still pretty good. It didnt age as well as i thought it would have back in the day. still good though, his callaborations with snoop are hot, and theres a couple other songs that aged well, i would still recomend this to just about anyone based on the history of it, and the genius that is the doctor, the greatest producer ever to step foot into the rap games door. 4.5"
3,Rappers need to be held accountable for their lyrics,"I'm sorry, but the ""I'm just tellin' it like it is"" defense can only be taken so far. Some of the violent, mysogynist lyrics on this CD are just too far over the edge to accept (I'm thinking about ""Rat tat tat tat"" in paticular). Yeah, the beats are dope, but Dre takes the thug life for granted the whole way through and fails to provide any alternative. It's like he views it as a legitimate way to live your life, and that is just totally irresponsible."
5,DEATH ROW,"The Chronic is the first G Funk album (and the best with Doggystyle) and one of the top 5 best rap CDs ever on any list. It is also the beginning of Death Row era, that includes one of the best rappers ever. There is no bad song on the whole album. Great rhymes from: Kurupt, RBX, Rage and Snoop on Srangled On Deth Row and Lyrical Gangbang, party songs Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat and Deeez Nuuuts and the legendary track Nuthing But A G Thang makes this album worth your money."
5,A Must,"We don't realize that the events that happen in the present are history.This album is classic, historical and one of the greatest hip hop/ rap albums ever. This was in the early 90s when if you really think about it, rap was still new. It was in its prime. We had Dr. Dre and Snoop running the industry. This is when west coast music was felt all over the U.S.This was before all that so-called ""east-west coast beef"". This is another historical hip hop album. This album laid the ground work. Classic album. Must have for collectors."
4,My first rap album....,"And thank God it was this one. Funkdafied beats, gangster lyrics and the debut of Snoop Doggy Dogg. Nothin but a G' Thang wasa huge hit from what I remember, I remember the video being number one on all of MTV's countdown lists. This album certainly took rap and most importantly, society, to the next level."
5,Dre's the best,"I am in Namibia where rap music is not the most popular. Aand the first real rap came from Dre and the N.W.A. crew, who back then was the best. I just wanna say that ""NOTHING BUT A G THING"" can is the only song I've heard that can really qaulify to be the American anthem. In whole he came out with a fresh style of rap and still the best producer in the business. I would like to hear Dr.Dre release another full lenght album on which he must be solo, cause Ijust can't get enough. ""The Dopest rapper, producer"" if you ask me."
5,another classic in the business,Dr.Dre's masterpiece.The classic from the greatest producer of all time.I love this cd.I hope dre return to rap againRIP all dead rappers
5,It was great,I love this album. This was the album that introduced me to rap and is what has kept me a true fan.
5,The first hip-hop classic.,"Let me make it plain:This is the LED ZEPPLIN IV, the KIND OF BLUE of 1990s hip-hop. It's a milestone.This is the Beatles. The hip-hop Stones would be TRIBE CALLED QUEST, and their classic is the Low End Theory."
5,Wow,"Highly Reccomended. Christopher Pike will never fail to disappoint you. He truely has so much potential and puts so much work into his books. I couldn't love him anymore. This book is great as well, all 1-6. I currently just finished 3. Praise to Krishna (Yea that's right) for creating such a great writer."
1,oh it is just great,this is so great i just love it ooh i just couldn't stop reading it oh it was the best book i have ever read i just wish pike would write a sequel to this great book oh it was my favorite but i do like it more than the book called umm nevermind about that but this probably in a mueseum or something but i just loved the end when the vampire got caught it was great but enough about me lets talk about the book oh wait this is the best i just love it it is a great book the best pike cannot write a better one if he tried great oh i loved it
2,Inferior Production,"Aside from Judy Kuhn, this version of ""Chess"" has little to recommend it. In trying to Americanize the show (U.S.A.! U.S.A.!) the writers/producers pandered to what they thought a Broadway audience wanted; consequently, the battle between ""us and them"" becomes horribly slanted. The original concept recording with Tommy Korberg and Elaine Paige (still the best of all Florences) and the Danish Original Cast remain the standout recordings."
5,Get the lube kit...,"Just received the tool and all seems well. I have air tool oil but there is a tiny, flush, grease fitting. After calling their tool tech support at 800-866-5457 I was told to get their 67-LBK1 kit. It's available here on Amazon for $24. I'll be getting one when I add something else to get the free shipping. Wish I knew this when I ordered the grinder. Now you know.Ingersoll Rand 67-LBK1 Air Care Kit, 67 Grease, 10 Oil, & Grease Gun"
1,Don't buy,"Review the comments on the Ingersoll-Rand 3102 grinder sander rated at 1 1/2 stars. Totally disagree with the writeups of the 3102K (kit) posted here as the grinder is awful. Agree with the assessment of the 3102 grinder and I'll add the following comments...The case is quite nice. My problems were the 2"" backing pad included in the kit had a machining flaw and would not mount the 2"" pads. Also the saftety trigger was sticky and would require two handed use to start (yuck). I returned this product."
5,Great Material to Teach Little Children in Spanish,¡Coleccion de 17 Canciones Clasicas! Includes the following themes (1) En la estacion (2) Martinillo (3) Mono araña (4) Si te sientes con las ganas (5) Tomados de las manos (6) Yanke doodle (7) El zoologico (8) Vamos a remar (9) Bingo (10) Yo soy un buen maquinista (11) Looby Loo (12) El señor me enseño a contar (13) Las profesiones (14) ¿Te gusta reir? (15) Vamos a saltar (16) Yo sirvo para (17) Diez en la cama.
3,Best 9/11 film yet,"A very good attempt to bring the events of 9/11 to light, as if we really need to but apparently we do. After Fahrenheit 9/11, this film, DC 9/11, was a refreshing change and focused on accuracy and truth. Some of the actors look-a-likes where really amazing. This film is how I remember it happened. The closest film to reality yet. Well done!"
1,Nine Month Miracle,"I was very dissappointed when the dvd ""None Month Miracle"" got delivered to my son & daughter-in-law. They are expecting their first baby & I remember how wonderful the dvd was for us years ago. Unfortunately, the dvd was made for computers -YEARS AGO! It didn't work with their new mac computer. So I wasted my money & they got all excited thinking they were going to enjoy the 3-d graphics & everything, only to be very dissappointed too. You should have to make it clear what operating systems-& how OLD! the dvd is. It was from back in like 1996! Such a shame!"
1,"Most of time, have to work to get it to power on.","I do not know if this is a design flaw (no power switch) or just a defective drive. I'm not going to try to find out, as I will simply return it and get another Western Digital. If I plug it into my, already started up, Thinkpad, it will not recognize it--ever. I have to unplug and replug in the power every time I want it to get recognized. What a pain. Returning it."
3,will need to spend another $50 on backup software,"Seagate backup software does not backup hidden or system files. In my opinion this is false advertising. They should call it automaticfile copying, not backup. You'll have to spend another $50 on backup software that works. Someone recommended acronis to me.Otherwise the drive has worked ok. Although today I had to reboot to get Windows to recognize it."
3,Big Storage for your desktop 500MB,"Seagate makes this big heavy 500GB drive which is quiet and reliable. Its definately a lot larger than a stapler, even a Swingline stapler !..but its still good value. The newer drives are smaller and lighter but with 500MB of storage this is a big boy. I dont expect this drive to be 'portable' and have a smaller Western Digital 160MB drive for my laptop case."
1,Great product until it stops working and you lose your content,"This product worked great for me for about a month, until one day I tried to access certain files, and about half of them were missing (I had about 50G or so of media files, including videos of my son). I tried accessing it from another computer, and more data was gone. Now the drive isn't recognized at all by any computer and I have no way of recovering the content without ruining the warranty.I've never posted a review before, but wanted anyone who is having problems to know that you should get any remaining data off of the drive as soon as possible before you lose it completely. After that, you can EITHER get your data back yourself (read up on removing it from its case to fix the issues), OR use the warranty. Unless you want to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars for them to do both. Also, unless you're using it for backup only, you might want to buy another one as backup for the first."
1,"This does not work, do not every buy anything from seagate","The one thing hard drives are supposed to do, is to store files so they won't get lost. my computer has notified me that around half of my music, or 30 gigs, couldn't be rewritten to this stupid hard drive, that was working five days ago. it seems that it is now randomly deleting all my music, and my computer is now fine. but this is around the 10th time there's been a problem with it. I couldn't be more angry with this product. please please never buy anything seagate makes."
3,Too big,"- Very large- Bad designed, could be horizontal, could easily tip over.- On 3 months was defective and was replaced by Segato.- Good speed- Ugly.- Great support from Seagate."
1,6 month life,"I expect a back up drive to last more than 6 months. The drive beeps but the computer doesn't recognize it. I tried different cables and different computers. Same result,,, not found. I won't buy another Seagate as this seems to be a common problem. (see Seagate website forums)"
5,"Reliable, fast, dependable hard drive.","After going through a number of hard drives, all of which work without problems, my favorite design is this new Seagate ""Free Agent"" line, which haa a compact and attractive form factor. Prices are highly competitive; consider their even larger 750Gb unit in this line; you always need more storage than you think. It's only a matter of time before 1TB and larger show up in this same attractive form factor; the mind boggles at such capacity, but if one stores music and video it is quickly absorbed. The pricing is almost as low (and still falling) as storing on good quality DVDs, even in compressed DivX format, and the convenience makes it good value. Imagine storing many hundreds of movies or music albums in such a compact physical format."
1,Product unsafe,"Just plugged in this 500 GB ext. HDD hoping to clear out some space on my system. Boy, did it. When the computer mounted the drive by USB, a the drive began a small Seagate software program. Unfortunately, this software has a bug, and began deleting files on my main drive! It took me a while to figure out what was going on, but by then it was too late.If you're looking for 500 GB in an External Hard Disk, the price on the SeaGate FreeAgent may look too good to be true. That's because it is.I strongly advise looking at competing brands for a safer device. I wish I had."
1,5 year warranty not enough,"I bought this drive in the summer of 2008 and unexpectedly in the summer of 2009 it just would not communicate with my MacBook pro. Seagate did do what they said and after I paid for shipping, after reading the problems other people have been experiencing, last month to the repair location they sent one back. Then I got a new or fixed drive and when I got it back it still did not communicate with my MacBook Pro. Now I am working to contact Seagate again to figure out what's wrong with the ""repaired"" drive. The Seagate drives are not worth the risk/money in my opinion. Don't think about the warranty. I need my drive and it won't even work and I've had to do so much to get it repaired/replaced.So all in all don't buy their products. WD works better if you ask me."
2,MAJOR FLAW,"This thing sucks. I have had the 500GB version for about 6 months. Yes it looks cool but I HATE the on/off button. Well its not a button its just a ""thing"" that you touch to turn it on and off. It never works! Just now it took me 30 seconds to get the thing to turn on and sometimes I have a hard time getting it to turn off!!!!! Why couldn't they be less cute and just add a regular switch!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Slow as Heck, Heats Up Like an Oven, Sleeps Like a Baby","I had this drive from a long time ago.As the title said, it was extremely slow, and got hot super quick (there are vents on the ""foot"" but it didn't help much, and if you accidentally cover the vents, you're screwed), and would go to sleep and never wake up. I had to unplug and replug the USB chord again to get it to wake up.Luckily, current drives have evolved a lot better off.If you ever see one of these around, buy it for a buck to frame up on the ""Wall of Shame."""
2,It annoys me -- find a different one.,"I've always had good luck with Seagate drives... But this drive really sucks, I am already looking for a replacement after 2 months.It frequently makes a loud high pitched noise.And it frequently goes missing from my machine -- I have to power cycle the drive to get it to show up.Get a different drive. Other reviewers seem to see similar problems.I didn't believe them at first, but I believe them now."
2,Not worth it,"Bought this and thought I got a great deal ($140). All three of my towers and one laptop have trouble detecting it. Also, it overheats in less than thirty minutes, even if it's just on. 500 gigs is nice, but not if you have to go through all this trouble. Lately it hasn't been detected at all by any of my computers. I'll probably remove the actual drive and see what I can do. This was totally not worth buying."
2,DON'T LET IT GET HOT!,"WELL RIGHT OUT OF BOX,THERE WERE NO LIGHTS.SETUP VERY EASY,JUST DO NOT LEAVE PLUGGED IN FOR A LONG TIME(5 OR 6HRS.)IT STARTED DELETING FILES,LUCKILY IT SHOWS ON THE TOOLBAR,AT FIRST I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT,BECAUSE I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE FILE,BUT THEN I NOTICED IT WAS DELETING MY RESTORE FILES.I TOOK IT OFF THE SYSTEM AND UNPLUGGED IT.I THEN CHECKED MY RESTORE AND ALL THE CHECKPOINTS WERE GONE.I NOW JUST PLUG IT IN WHEN I AM GOING TO USE IT."
2,USB port detaches from circuit board,It was a great HD for a year until the USB port came loose and started rattling around. I would only buy this HD if you plan and backing files up and storing the HD in a safe.
2,"Good customer service, but unreliable drive","After asking around about hard disk reliability, I was pointed to Seagate. The drive comes in a very nice package/enclosure. It is easy to install and format, even on a Mac. I never experienced any problems switching the drive from Mac to PC...and then after about three months, the drive just died. No warning, it just wouldn't power up one day. I went online and there is an automated RMA/return form to fill out and within few days a refurbished drive shows up, then you send the dead one back. While this is very easy and convenient...I LOST ALL MY DATA and had to spend hours recreating. My next drive will be a LaCie which gets better reliability scores."
1,Make sure you know what it is compatible with!,Make sure you know what it is compatible with! It only works with certain d-link products but they do not tell you this on the website. Make sure you know what works with it. The D-Link WRLS RANGE EXTENDER 802.11G ( DWL-G710 ) works well and with other products.
1,"Extends, but doesn't pick up IP numbers!","When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number. Unplug this extender, and the PC is assigned an IP number by the router without any problem. A brief power blackout will cut IP numbers to your wirelessly-connected PCs. I purchased this particular D-link range extender because I wanted to ensure that it works well with my DI-624 router. I wasted my money buying this device. It's useless, and it's too light to even serve as a door stop..."
1,"Don't Buy This, You will regret it!","I had the worst time working with my D-Link wireless router. After talking on the phone with several different customer service representatives, I was told that I should purchase this 800AP to extend my wireless range. I went ahead and bought it. After hours trying to get this thing to work, I called the customer service number, and got some help. After working with them on the phone for a couple more hours, I was then told I did not need the range extender. I was very furious because I kept getting different answers.If you are thinking of improving your wireless router, just upgrade to Wireless G, from a different vendor!If you really want this range extender, let me know, Ill send you mine!"
1,DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED,"DO NOT BUY this product if you are intending to use it as a repeater. It does not support WPA or WPA-PSK in repeater mode. Their web site does not mention this, nor does their firmware upgrade documentation. I spoke with a tech who admitted this fact, but the idea that their ads were [...] did not mean much to him. This product will NOT work with their DL-624 in repeater mode if you want to have a WPA secure network."
1,Please Step Away from the D-Link!,"Another steller D-Link product. Works great as long as you don't want to use WEP Encryption. After going through 5 phone techs, I finally had one level with me, saying ""look, this thing never works with the encryption turned on"". After that, I called back and the 2nd-Tier phone tech told me the same thing. Buyer Beware, don't purchase if you want to keep your network WEP turned on!!"
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS ONE,"Being in need of this product I went to the the only retail store in my area that had them. Fry's Electronics had ten of them on the shelf, all with customer returned stickers on them. The salesman assured me that they were ok & were probably bought to use with an incompatable router. Since I knew that my router a DI-624 had to be revision C to work with this item I reluctantly went ahead & got it.After 4 calls & many hours spent on the phone w/ tech support I finally took mine back...I would say there is probably a problem with this model... too many returned ones on the shelf & I would imagine the majority of them didn't work too."
5,A Wireless Repeater for the DI-624 Wireless Router Only,"After purchasing a DI-624 and having that one raouter cover so much ground (air?) with a wireless signal I wanted to cover the rest of my expansive house with wireless internet coverage. This little box is just what I needed. First you plug this box into one of the router's open LAN ports, then access it via web browser and configure it (about 2 mins) to work with your wireless network.This box will see the DI-624 and you just need to set it in wireless repeater mode. Then go put the little box at about the edge of where you get no more signal from the DI-624. I used my laptop for this. If the 624 reached out say 100 feet from it's base with wireless signal I set this little repeater at about the 75 foot mark to make sure it got a strong enough signal yet still add adequate coverage for the rest of my home.It's simple enough and it works reliably. After setting up as a repeater you don't need to worry about it anymore."
3,MAJOR PAIN TO SETUP.. BUT WORKS WELL..,"As a network engineer, we've setup lots of wireless networks and never has one been so difficult to setup as these DWL-G800AP's and it's partner, the DI-624 rev C.Their setup manual and live tech support are a joke.First, make sure you have all correct firmware:DI-624: Rev2.37 and DWL-G800AP Rev 1.05(These are the config we used and finally worked)In the DI-624, Changed the channel to 1, disabled the super G. In the G800AP, run the site survey, and select accordingly, than manually add the GW (default 192.168.0.1). Wallah.. works. I've read that the WEP and security does not work but it doesn't matter since this project is for a hotel.NOTE: Some changes works immediately where others takes a minute to propagate through the network. If your change does not work after a minute, re-apply that change and try again.Final word.. don't buy this device if you expect an easy setup.TranTampa, FL[...]"
5,Must read.,"This book is a must read for anyone, whether you're just entering the work force or nearing retirement. Although it is most helpful to those who will be affected by estate tax, there is important information here dealing with IRA's, taxes etc., that everyone needs to be aware of. Well written & easy to understand."
4,The retirement Savings Time Bomb,"Worth the price...easy read, sometimes wordy...taught me worthwhile info on retirement savings, and how to keep the government away from your money."
1,Ed Slot's Retirement / Estate Tax Advisory,"I read this book three years ago and found it enlightening. It covered all the bases concerning the pitfalls of not shielding your estate from both federal, state, and estate taxes.All in all it is an excellent book however I do have one complaint. Although I read this same book three years ago, made notes and took his advice, I was under the distinct impression this was an update, 2012 version of the 2003 version I had already read. It was advertised as the new version, and since tax laws change yearly, this book was of no use to me in its 2003 edition. I don't see how a 2003 edition of a TAX ADVICE book could be of much use to anyone."
3,Well written but quite bias,"Alan Schreck certainly has written a wonderfully fluid text that is easy to read. There are some 200+pages of text with the last 100 focusing on the 20th century.While it was a pleasant read, the author is too subjective in his analysis. The different inquisitions are glossed over and he defines the great periods of the chuch as those during which the church was most able to expand its influence (not the time during which it did the most good).If you love the catholic church and want to feel good about it, then this is the book to read. However, if you want a more serious and objective view of the history of the catholic church then I would recommend other texts beyond just this one."
1,Disapointing,"This book is vaguley geared to thoose with disabilites. I would find this useful if I was in a wheel chair or had another obstacle. However having a pain disorder the book read to me of that of ""NORMAL"" healthy people. Wasted my limited money."
1,Errors errors errors!,This book is useless. It's so full of mistakes that it might hurt your score to work through it! Time is better spent doing real LSAT games. I also worked through the Powerscore Logic Games Bible and it was waaaaaaay better.
3,Typos,"This book is full of typos, to the point where by correcting them you are in a way indirectly learning/reinforcing your skills. But everyone is right, I thought it didn't mirror the LSATs (I took it once). Also, they always use the same names for ABCDEFGHI that you get used to it...unfortunately the LSAT mixes it up much more than that."
1,full of errors,The other reviews weren't joking when they said this book is full of errors. I just realized I wasted $20 on this book.
2,Ashbery and Naive Literature,"I picked this up on impulse. I'm interested in the work of Henry J. Darger. But I was not taken by this book at all. Ashbery flows a lot of beautiful verbiage together. But it's incomprehensible at a first reading and I'm not going to spend more time trying to root anything out of it. It seems like a lot of surrealist automatic writing. There were occasional images that would surface in an appealing way like, ""count the dogs as furniture as otherwise there will be no chairs,"" but few of the images recurred enough to give any sense of narrative or unifying theme. I bet Darger's naive literature is a lot more fascinating than this."
1,Demonically inspired. Done in very poor taste,"I actually thought I might learn some stuff from this DVD judging from the title. But when I played it at home, I could not get past how the maker of the DVD portrays himself as evil incarnate complete with fires and hoods and the like. Look up the word ""grimoire"" and see if you want to be associated with the likes of that. I for one am not looking for any way to dishonor God by watching this DVD. It's a shame because this might have been a great DVD if they would only clean up the presentation of it. I will shred this DVD and search Amazon for a more respectable presentation.In Summary: if you have no problem with watching evil darkside videos, you will probably be okay with this. If you are a Christian or someone who does not want to dishonor God, find another DVD."
1,poor tech service,"The adapter doesn't work with any of the new Mac systems. Needed it connect the Garmin GPS, but Belkin doesn't update their drivers or tech support people. They are always busier than usual ... not true. They don't put out relible products."
1,Not for Mac osx 10.x or better,First I would like to say that I did not purchase this from Amazon. I did purchase this for my Macbook Pro as it stated that it supported Mac computers. That is not the case if you have a newer Intel Mac running osx 10.x or better. There are no drivers and none of the universal drivers will work either. Avoid this product if you happen to have an Intel based Mac.
4,"Future Children's Librarian bears her ""Teeth""","The best behavior series is tackling children's less than desirable behaviors one by one;preventing kicking, hitting, the sharing of germs, tail pulling, and now, biting. The text highlights the benefits of teeth for activities such as chewing and smiling as well as acknowledging situations where children might want to bite and alternatives to biting. A variety of well-drawn illustrations present a variety of children in multiple environments. The text does not follow a predictable pattern-while some phrases are used repeatedly, the pattern changes a few times over the course of the text, from ""Teeth are not for biting"" to ""Biting hurts"" and back again, which may be confusing for the 0-3 year old audience. Parents may appreciate the resources for discouraging biting and assistance with teething available at the end of the book."
4,Secrets of Your Family Tree: Healing for Adult Children of Dysfunctional Families,"Everyone will benefit from this book, but especially those involved in helping professions. Not only can you use it in your work, but it will help you see why YOU tick like you do! Written from a Christian perspective with Biblical examples."
3,Died after 1 year,"This switch worked great for exactly 1 year and one day, then stopped working. I bought a Netgear gigabit switch to replace it."
1,Was I supposed to learn anything???,"I really have to say that I`m really disapointed..... I`m fairly new to programming, and of course using a mac, I thought this book would be very helpful. But it was not.The dummies books are either very good or really bad, and this is really bad. It contains mostly bad jokes by the author , which isn`t funny at all, and some stupid examples of code that are completely uninteresting. As I have understood what programming is all about is to make a useful application, or in my case a game, or whatever, and this book contains nothing at all. It`s over 400 pages of absolutely nothing. The layout of the book is criminally bad, too.If you are new to programming,save a tree and do not read this book. You`ll be ten times more confused than you were before."
1,Where's the source code?,I cannot recommend this book because the CD-ROM provided with it did not contain the source code promised on the back cover. My request for help at www.dummies.com was refused because the book is out-of-print.
3,TOO BASIC!!,"If you didn't have a experience of programming ever, you may read this book. But it was just too basic. So through you have read this book, you cannot write any useful programs. If you can write a program with C, do not read this book."
5,Amazing Movie,"I fell in love with this movie on the first watch through, and not only because of the top hat and eye patch. Great movie that doesn't dwell on the coming out part so much as being yourself."
5,the curiosity of chance,what a wonderful little film. did not expect this to be a good as it isvery proud of the lead actor's work/ with BAND CAMP-being his first film he has shown he is a great actor.
1,Don't Buy AVEDA Online,The AVEDA products for sell here are either old product or illegally diverted product. Most of the time you will pay more for old product. You can order new product directly from AVEDA or buy at a local AVEDA salon. Save money and make sure you are using product that works.
2,Works but stinks,The shoe is ok. The main disadvantage is that it starts to stink pretty bad after few climbs. My other sport shoes do not smell anyhow but this one should be called Stinky not Smoothy.
5,No one can rock a microphone quite like Bus Stop.,"From their impressive debut with Dance Dance Revolution, Bus Stop has been living up to their reputation as one of the phattest remix/MC combos in music. Taking classic crowd-pleasing favorites like Carl Douglas's ""Kung Fu Fighting"" or T-Rex's ""Bang A Gong"", Bus Stop adds their own innovative lyrical and musical twist, with their trademark thumping backbeat and mad lyrical styling. The ""Na Na Na Na"" solo on ""Na Na Hey Hey"" is one of the more amazing vocals I've ever heard, and Bus Stop's subtle twist on the chorus of ""Bang A Gong, Get It On"" to ""Get It On, Bang A Gong"" is just genius. A must-buy for everyone on your wish list, and everyone else too!"
5,Los Tres Diamantes revisited,"It was a pleasure to hear ""The Three Diamonds"" without the scratching and hissing of an LP. I've waited for some time in trying to collect Los Tres Diamantes on CD. Thanks for the memories Diamantes."
3,Supernatural Magnet,This movie pulls you into the spirituality of Santeria (The Way of the Saints) and Brujeria (black magick). The two are not to be confused with each other but sometimes this movie did just that and that paints an unrealistic picture of the beauty of this religion. They did the best they could with what they had to work with but it could have been made better.
5,Hoodoo You Think You Are?...,"Martin Sheen (The Dead Zone) plays Cal Jamison, a psychologist who gets mixed up w/ a cult that practices human sacrifice (on kids no less). It seems that this underground group of hoodoo fanatics is responsible for a recent pair of child mutilations. Dr. Jamison, who has already lost his wife in a bizarre kitchen ""accident"", must now fight to keep his only son from the clutches of this mob of murderous, religious crazies! He is helped by a tough, cynical cop (Robert Logia from Independence Day and Scarface) and by a local practitioner of santeria. Jimmy Smits (""NYPD Blue"") is an early victim, and Richard Masur (The Thing) plays Jamison's lawyer. THE BELIEVERS is actually pretty frightening and effective in it's presentation of black magic at work in New York City. Add it to your horror / supernatural thriller collection..."
5,AeroPress Coffee Maker,"Easy to use; coffee less acidic so tastes great and healthier, cleans with ease, doesn't take up a lot of space. GREAT."
5,Great for a Powerful 2-3 Cups of Coffee,"If you're someone who drinks 2 pots of coffee daily, this product will not be for you as it makes only about 2 decently strong cups of coffee at a time. It is nice that it's a press style and the polymer it is made out of has held up thus far to my uses (I have owned and use daily for 6 months).I know users have posted pictures of discoloration, but I have not had this problem at all, perhaps the company addressed the issue or has to do with cleaning habits (I rinse everything after each use not just the plunger rubber."
5,enlightenment,"after climbing the mountain of coffee making device after device, I have reached the mountain top. The Aeropress is awesome, the instructions really improve your coffee making technique and gave me ideas for how to improve it in general, not only with the Aeropress. But I love the device, super easy to use, fast, easy to clean, portable, and only $30. I like this way better than a perculator, drip pot, pour-over or French Press. I highly highly recommend, and I am super picky about my espresso."
2,Does not do the job,This did not really make coffee the way I wanted it to. The water drips through so quickly that it does not have enough time to soak in the taste from the coffee and create that strong espresso taste. Dont waste your money on this. It works just the same as any single cup filter that is much cheaper and much less of a headache to use
5,Wonderful Press that you Shouldn't Press,"I bought this little gem b/c my apt is so small and i didn't want to decrease usable counter space with a big coffee maker. When i first began to use it, unfortunately my coffee was lousy so I experimented every day with less and less ground coffee beans until i found that sweet equilibrium. If you buy this, here's my trick. I don't use the plunger but simply let gravity take control. But if you drink a larger mug like me, you will need to pour the boiling water in twice to fill the cup.Cleaning is as easy as can be - no more than a little soap and spunge for 30 seconds and viola- it's ready for tomorrow. The filters they provide also make it simple as can be.All in all, this is exactly what i needed - bravo! :)"
4,Virgin coffee drinker,"I bought this the other day off amazon to make single cups of coffee for my girlfriend who is a heavy coffee drinker. She hasn't tried it yet but I would surmise that she will like it. I am not a coffee drinker, coffee never thrilled me like it does people up north and out west. But the ease and simplicity of this gadget is what I like. For one it doesn't take electricty and it is small enough to put in a backpack for camping outings, which is the biggest reason I got it. The coffee it makes seems to be quite good, I made 2 cups using Colombian Starbucks coffee. Like I said I am not a coffee drinker but this thing makes VERY strong coffee for me. It is easy to use but I can see it will go through coffee grounds quickly if used everyday. I am going to experiment with different ways and maybe buy a more milder blend for my tastes. But all in all this thing will be great to take camping this summer and my girlfriend will love being able to have coffee in the woods."
1,This is not a better mousetrap,"I gave this a one star not because of poor quality. No, the product is well designed and made. I figured if your looking to buy you might read a one-star and I could save you the trouble of buying this. This device produced coffee no better than a French press or even the simplest of all devices - the Melitta cone. Those two devices are cheap to buy, easy to use, and fast.The time needed to make a cup using the Aeropress is way too complicated and long, with no significant difference in quality or flavor. Yes it's cool looking and you can wow coffee snobs, but I would defy anyone to taste the difference between using the Aerobie and the French press/Melitta. Seriously - I need to use 175 degree water and use a thermometer for optimum brewing?! If you have that much time in the morning, go ahead and buy this."
1,Thin coffee,Water raced through the coffee and filter creating a very thin coffee. No need for the plunger water had already permeated the coffee into the cup and was terrible. Was really looking forward to this product based on the reviews.
3,Slightly clumsy coffee press,"I was told that this coffee press was ""all that and the bag of chips."" But not really. I mean, it's good and all, but not great. And there are a lot of parts to it, so it makes it tricky to clean and keep track of. But it works!!"
5,Best Cup Of Coffee I Have Had,"Really glad that I finally tried this. The coffee it makes is unbelievably good for the price. I tested it with my drip coffeemaker and tasted them side by side, and the difference was significant.* Very easy to use* Very easy to clean* Great coffee - espressos or americanosOnly potential downside is that it will only make 4 espressos at once, or about two cups of coffee if you add water. It's easy to clean (takes 5 seconds) and press again, but for a party or a come and go event . . . will be too time intensive to work well. Not sure what I'll use.The coffee is great. Before I had this, I drank coffee mainly for the caffeine boost, now I really like it again. It's the best $30 you can spend on Amazon if you like coffee. Highly, highly recommended."
5,Revolutionary!,"This is truly a great product. I am making coffee to match what I used to find only in the finest shops and restaurants. It took some experimenting to master, but now I can make coffee faster and easier with this thing than with a drip pot. It is extremely well designed and built. Water temperature is very important. I didn't get consistently great results until I bought a food thermometer and came up with a routine of first pouring from the kettle into the plunger piece (to cool the water to about 175 deg F), then onto the coffee."
4,Great Simple Tasty,"The aeropress makes a great cup of coffee. I use it at work (manufacturing) during my long shifts. I've found that about two scoops of not quite espresso grind coffee and an 12-16 oz of water makes a good stout Americana style coffee that I drink unadulterated. Very smooth. Then I rinse it off, dry it, and put it back into my toolbox.The only negative is that it looks like a big syringe! My boss came through and watched me make my coffee and asked if I needed to take a drug test."
5,Amazing little device!,"I'm somewhat of a coffee snob and doubted that a $25 update on a French press could make great coffee. Products that erase my doubt, by definition, enter my pantheon of great products. My ONLY complaint is how quickly one goes through coffee with this thing - it takes a pile of grounds to make an Americano or a ""double shot"" - even gets a little foam on top like a crema! - but the results are OUTSTANDING. I could drink the stuff all day as it's very low acidity from the limited contact time between water and grounds. Cleanup is a snap, as all you need to do is remove the cap, eject the ""puck"" into wherever your used coffee goes, and wash like any normal dish. I have no idea why a couple extraneous-seeming black plastic parts are sent with the Aeropress either, but far better to have a working press with a couple extras than not enough! If you want delicious coffee on the cheap, AeroPress IS THE WAY TO GO!"
4,Good for cold brew filtering,"I use a cold brew method for my coffee and I didn't want to have to make a special large grind for my French Press anymore. This little product does the trick, by allowing me to filter and press my cold mix made with a regular grind size. The bonus is there is no dust in the bottom of my cup. I am very satisfied."
1,An Arm Breaker,Avoid this little coffee maker.It could cause injury to you shoulder or wrist.The picture of a hand pusing it down with just the finger tips is misleading. It takes putting your weight behind it. What it makes is not espresso.
5,Makes awesome coffespresso,The trick is getting the grinds right (you'll need a burr grinder) but when you do you will get the best cup of ameriano/latte you've ever had with relatively little effort. Simply awesome!
5,an amazing coffee maker,"for making one cup at a time, this little guy can't be beat. impressively simple design, easy to clean, makes a terrific cup of coffee. One tip: since you're making only one cup, I'd recommend you pre-heat your mug before preparing your coffee, to prevent the coffee from cooling down too much."
5,Easiest good cup of coffee you can make!,"My husband and I got this for a wedding gift, both being primarily tea drinkers but wanting to accommodate java hounds when they visited. I have started drinking coffee in the mornings again, it's so easy. The coffee is smooth and tasty, and aside from heating the water it was a 30 second process."
1,"Defective plastic, silent customer service","I got my aeropress three months ago and found it made good coffee. I like the individual serving idea. About two months later, the plastic on the inside of the cylinder started to break down, forming wrinkles on the inside of the vessel, looking lousy and causing me to wonder if it is or will begin leaching chemical compounds into my morning brew. I alerted the manufacturer to this via the email contact form on their website--twice--and heard nothing in return.So, despite the nifty concept and design, I have to rate this product poorly. In my case it has proven defective, and the company has declined to stand behind it."
4,kc,"Might seem like a lot of trouble for a single cup, but the result is a very good cup of coffee.Product seems durable & very easy to clean.Would like to see a multi-cup version similar to French Press."
5,The best espresso ever!,"What a find! I couldn't believe the flavor of the espresso resulting from the AeroPress. Very clean, full-bodied, no bitterness, yum! And, on top of everything else, I get a workout every morning pressing! Must be careful for I fear that if the cup gets a bit off balance, everything will fly across the kitchen in a million different directions. Worth the risk. Use with the Aerolatte frother for an amazing cappuccino."
5,Great coffee!,"I got this after my brother showed me how easy he made espresso with his. It is genius! I have used a french press before, but feel I get a better cup with the aeropress, plus the convenience of only having to make one cup. Great product."
5,No more bitter coffee !,"I was skeptical about this device, so I ordered one.I have to say it was great that it worked as it was supposed to and the coffee that comes from it is very smooth.I had stopped drinking coffee for a while and had never found any type of home coffee maker that worked well for me.It does take some experimentation to get it the way you like it, between the temperature of the water ( which is critical, but easy to do in a microwave with consistent results ) amount of water and amount of coffee. Once you have that all worked out, it makes a very predictable brew.I even tried making some in advance to bring to work with me, which worked fine as well, and makes it easier since you don't need to futz with it at the office.You will need access to running water to clean it after each run, but other than that what more could you ask for, it's portable and easy to use."
4,"Makes good coffee, a little expensive.","I bought this item a few weeks ago and I've had a chance to test it out with various grinds. It makes a pretty good latte/americano style coffee in that it produces a small quantity of concentrated coffee which you must dilute with hot water or milk. It's not quite as good as a real shot of espresso, but I use it for the office and it works great. I find that it works best if you use a fine espresso grind. Regular drip grind shoots right through it and comes out a bit week. The finer grind requires a little harder pushing to work it through the filter, but its worth it.I also like that this item is lightweight and really really easy to clean up. It might be good for camping as a result.I would highly recommend this item if you love good coffee, but I also think it's a little expensive for what it's made of... plastic."
3,paper filter eliminated all the character,"The product is as advertised. Neat, quick, decent coffee. Similar principle as French Press... but less fuss, less mess, faster cleanup.HOWEVER... french press makes a MUCH more flavorful cup IMHO.Probably the paper filter is taking out all the goodies. I'll splurge for the metal filter next and see if that improves the flavor. I really want this to work!PROS: cheap, compact, fast, easy cleanup, sweet tasting coffee. paper filter is cheap to refill and will last a long time.CONS: flavor not nearly as complex or satisfying as french press. I'm blaming the paper filter...I consider this a economical improvement over drip coffee."
4,DO NOT SQUIRT DIRECTLY INTO MOUTH,"I ~~LOVE~~ my aeropress and I must tell you that it makes GREAT coffee, the kind of coffee probably drank by GREEK GODS on ~~mt. olympus~~ BUT i also must warn you that this brews coffee at a temperature which can only be described as ""hephaestian"" and AS SUCH should not be squirted directly into one's mouth. ONE FATEFUL MORNING i attempted to do so myself, in a mad dash to the curiosity shoppe, with no time for the morning news or silverware, and let me assure you that my mouth was summarily SCALED with the heat of a thousand fiery suns. Since this tragic day I have developed what my dear companion refers to as a ""Lisping Manner"" but I do think it suits my visage so it is serendipitous indeed that I had my chance encounter with the molten wares of the Aerobie AeroPress Coffe and Espresso and Permanent Speech Impediment Maker(tm).I cannot recommend this product enough for those who wish to make wonderful coffee or adopt a new and interesting vocal affectation."
4,"aeropress - great, but a tad pricey","I love this device as its the best espresso maker you can get under $1k. Better quality comes from the high in in-coffee house machines. home machines can't come close.I did not give it 5 stars for 2 reasons:-it is overpriced, for being several simple pieces of cheap injection molded plastic, with the addition of a rubber plunger and some numbers. The raw materials here don't even total $1. I could do this with some cheap lab equipment.-2...its really my problem...I bought filters thinking it didn't come with filters...now I have too many filters"
4,Pretty good americano,"I purchased this out of curiosity, after hearing about it on my local radio. The press was easy to use and clean up. For my first cup, I used a flavored coffee and I could smell the hazelnut aroma and definitely taste it. The coffee was smooth and rich. No complaints. However, I have a super automatic expressso machine which makes the absolute best coffee in the world. Once you taste this, you can never go back to drip. One push of a button makes a single perfect cup of coffee every time; no bitterness, heated just right with gorgeous light brown froth (crema) covering the top; a pleasure to drink and even easier to use. The AeroPress is very good, and if you drink drip coffee, I would definitely recommend this. But it just can't beat coffee made by a super automatic expresso machine."
4,I love my giant coffee syringe,"Easy to make a great single cup of coffee, or a thermos of Americano. I've stuck my old drip maker in the cabinet and I'm not enough of an aficionado to buy a thousand dollar uber machine. My only gripe is that I wish it came with a travel bag, or that it was possible to transform it into some neat travel ready brick."
2,Average coffee in a pinch,this is a decent coffee maker. If you do not have access to an espresso macine and like to have an average cappachino or americana it will do a pretty good job. They have done a very good job in the design to make it as easy as possible to get the job done. I use it at the office with the hotwater from our coffe maker and it gets the job done
5,Best cup of coffee ever!,"Not many products live up to the hype - Aeropress coffee maker is the exception. Best cup of coffee ever! In fact, it's so good, I'm tempted to take it everywhere I go. Very easy to make. Requires steady pressure, but I'm a very small woman and it's no problem. If it seems hard, let go, let plunger rise up on its own, press down again. Plunger will continue to move down with almost no effort.ENJOY!"
5,Surprisingly good.,"I thought there was some hype and I was skeptical of plastic, but it makes great coffee. A frail person might have trouble depressing the plunger but for most people it is easy. Great control over the brew."
1,"Extremely unstable, impossible to use","Don't even try making coffee with this. It's extremely unstable on anything you try setting it on, so pushing down on the plunger causes it to flip over and cause hot coffee to go everywhere, and if you try holding the side of the coffee maker, it WILL burn you. It also does NOT come with a mug, even though it's shown with a really nice looking transparent one. Avoid this product at all costs."
1,AeroPress coffee maker,More trouble than it is worth. We used it several times and went back to our french press unit. Very hard to push the plunger down.
2,NO WAY,"THIS CAME WITHOUT THE PROMISED BAG TO CONTAIN ALL THE ITEMS. IT IS CUMBERSON TO USE AND REQUIRES TOO MANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND STEPS - SOMETHING TO CONTAIN AND TO HEAT WATER, A SEPARATE CUP, ETC. A USELESS GADGET EVEN IF IT WERE A QUARTER OF THE PRICE. THERE ARE MANY SELF-CONTAINED GADGETS THAT DO THE SAME THING AT A SIMILAR PRICE. NOW I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE CONSIDERAVBLE EFFORT TO RETURN THIS AND GET A REFUND."
3,Leaking problem,It leaks all of the water I put in before I start applying the pressure and I dunno is that because I don't add a lot of coffee? Or is it a factory related problem?
5,Wonderful...,I purchased the Aeropress to replace a French Press. I'm really impressed with the way this works. It produces a very smooth cup of coffee or espresso and clean-up is much easier than a French Press. I'd recommend this to anyone that would like to make one cup of coffee at a time.
5,I like this coffee maker,"Well, so much has been said already there is not a whole lot to add. I bought this with the idea that I would use it mainly when camping... away from electricity. When I received I used a couple days just to see what it was like. I used it every day after that unless we had company (and I needed more coffee at one time). The coffee is very good. I am no connoisseur but have learned to like strong flavorful coffee. Making coffee this strong in a drip maker is not as good... more bitter I guess.I have a pattern... this much water in the microwave for this long, this much coffee, pour the water this way, plunge. I get very good coffee in a short amount of time. Very good. I may have to buy another as the rubber part of my plunger is getting hard and not sealing well. But I have been using it around 3 years."
3,A tragic beginning...,"A solid read that addresses the abuse of young lady and the impacts it has on her life. Despite being privileged and wealthy, Betsy doesn't ooze entitlement, so much as tragedy and brokenness. Some folks are screwed from an early start and she's one of them.I must admit that this felt long, despite being only 213 pages. I understand the patterned behavior. And, I get how many of the folks in this book are simply void of any decency...and that our lead character is drawn to these people. It's just kinda hard to read for 175 pages before you reach some semblance of humanity."
3,review,"I like the book, thought it was good. Only thing is it bounced around alot, if you didn't read it everyday you would be lost."
2,Not As Bad As Everyone Thinks,"Okay LaToya isn't the greatest singer in the world, but face it none of the Jacksons are terrific singers, just good performers. Though Janet and Michael are good performers, they also have very limited vocal ranges that can't compare to Whitney, Chaka, or Patti.Anyways... this cd isn't as bad as you might think. Had LaToya had better management and remixed a few of the songs, I think it would have given her career the boost it desperately needed. The two highlights are ""Turn On The Radio"" and ""Tell Me She Means Nothing To You"". Had they been remixed, ""Such A Wicked Love"", ""You're Gonna Get Rocked"", and ""Ain't Nobody Loves You"" would have been better songs. ""You Blew"" and ""Just Say No"" should have been scrapped.With all of her albums, there are usually 2 or 3 good songs on each that could put her on the charts, but sadly the wrong songs get picked as lead singles and therefore the albums suffer and die a quick death."
2,pretty whack,silent weapons for quiet wars didnt really sound like a wu tang family album.the beats were average and some of the lyrics didnt even sync with the beats.from the 17 songs there was only about 5 good ones.you havent heard of these guys?well its cause they are pretty whack.dont buy it.
1,Scrapin' the bottom of the Wu-barrel,"Living proof that the creativity of the Wuclan is *not* limitless. The beats are tired, the rapping sounds exactly like what it is (second-rate imitations of the Wu style) and the concept is straight up wack. Shaolin monks I can buy, 'cause it's kind of cool, but soldiers?? Save your money."
3,Nice Design but not enough choices,Loved the design and the feel. Only problem is there was only one size. I took a shot and ordered it but it was too big. so had to return it. I'm still keeping my eye open maybe there will be a size 10.
1,Florsheim shoes,"I have three other pairs of Florsheim shoes size 8 1/2 that fit fine. This pair was clearly a 9, or more, but I needed them immediately. So I put some Dr Scholl's insoles in them and made do with them."
4,Needs more songs,"Kane & Abel's debut wuz hella tight, but it needed more songs. The best songs are Black Jesus,3/2 Murder 1, and Abortion. The rest of the album iz tight too, but Gangstafied iz kinda weak. Buy it if you're a TRU No Limit fan or if U just like rap period."
4,hard...,"I've seen some of his videos in '97 and they're tight as hell! It's a cool Cd though to kick back to and whatnot. If you're a real G, then you'll buy this album."
3,Yoga for Beginners,"If I bought this book, and I do not remember ever buying this book, then it was as a gift for someone else. My recommendation on this book should mean nothing to anyone."
2,very thin,"I kept this because it was the only white chenille cover I could find, but it is sooooooo thin. It looks and feels very cheap."
4,Looove it!,It's super soft and snugly. Haven't had to clean it yet but it's pretty luxurious despite.I would definitely recommend this.
4,Spike and Dru,"I love Spike and Dru! This book was one of the best Buffy books i have read. I loved the way the author protrayed the way that Spike would do anything for Dru. This made the book more enjoyable.One good thing was it had few characters. in most Buffy books, thre are extra characters that make it difficult for you to keep all the different storylines straight.This book takes place long before Spike and Dru came to Sunnydale and that is good because the show is talking about the history and now you get to experience first-hand (with the exception of ""Fool For Love"") the the way these charcters were in the past and that they really did have a life before they had met Buffy.All in all i loved this book. i would recommend it to anyone who likes Spike and Dru and Buffy books in general."
3,Quick pros and cons,"Pros:-Wonderfully small form factor, so it's easy to move between different rooms, houses, etc.-Component, S-video and Composite options-Very easy to make region free and does PAL/NTSC conversion on the fly ( no SECAM but does any player do that or need to?), so perfect for the fan of UK/European and elsewhere DVDs.Cons:-Sucker gets HOT! If it's in a stack of Teac components (they do a whole line in this form factor) make sure its on top or on a well vented shelf.-The player can be a bit finicky: superbit or just really loaded DVDs can take quite some time to load and may not be initially recognized. We often get 30-45 seconds of spinning, followed by a ""no disc"" message. Pop the disc out, load it again, no problem. These issues happened before any fiddling with the region settings. We will sometimes also get player-based freezes on discs that do not skip in any of our other systems. Again, I think this might be part of the heat issue."
2,Poor quality workmanship,"While the slipper is comfortable enough, the quality of the product is awful. I have had mine for less than 6 months and the soles are seperating from the uppers, the insoles are seperating from the sole, and the sole on the left slipper is splitting at the toe. I have had cheep five dollar slippers last for several YEARS and these last less than 6 months! What a waste of money."
2,Not what we expected...,"My son received this toy on his first birthday. He loves Winnie-the-Pooh, and although it seems to be a very durable toy, it is difficult to play with. The ""wires"" aren't spaced far enough apart to easily maneuver bees from one side to the other. That's basically all this toy consists of, other than having a nice ""baby powder"" smell. It just doesn't hold my son's interest for very long."
4,Book 1,"The Gereon Resistance believed that if it held out long enough help would come and their world would be liberated from the forces of Chaos. But when Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his team arrive, liberation is not in their Orders. Gaunt's team is to have the Resistance lead them deep into Chaos territory. There, they must locate and rescue a high-ranking Imperial officer that has been captured. This must be accomplished before the enemy manages to break through the officer's mindlock. Otherwise, the rescue mission becomes an assassination.**** This is the first novel of ""The Lost"" series involving Gaunt's Ghosts. Judging by this story, the series will be a winner. (This series is part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.) At times the story slows down, but readers will not find themselves becoming too bored. I found myself fascinated as the officer's story began to unfold and I learn WHY Gaunt's mission is so vital. All-in-all, a very good read. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
4,"Un ""must"" dans la bibliothèque","Un des meilleurs livres de recettes de chocolat que j'ai vu. Bien que j'ai d ajuster les temps de cuisson occasionnellement, j'ai eu beaucoup de succès avec toutes les recettes que j'ai faites. J'ai toujours hte d'essayer un nouveau dessert. On me réclame souvent le gteau marbré et le roulé à la mousse au chocolat et noisettes. Ce sont devenus des ""classiques"" dans mon répertoire de desserts. J'espère que Mary Bergin écrira d'autres livres avec de nouvelles recettes tout aussi intéressantes."
1,Penguin's Iron Mask: Not a Good Edition,"A work of historical fiction, written in the eighteenth century, and set in the seventeenth, needs endnotes. All the more so if the edition is in English and the original in French. This proves a glaring lack in the case of Penguin's The Man in the Iron Mask; it lowers my opinion of the usually competent publisher. Without notes, translator Joachim Neugroschel finds himself at odd moments inserting the original French in brackets. The translation is less than successful in other ways as well. Neugroschel uses intrusive colloquialisms (""C'mon"" and ""Were they gonna shoot us?"") and worse yet mixes them with graceless versions of Dumas's formal sentence structures (as in the terrible reply ""It was I who was gonna shoot you."") Really, how did a publisher like Penguin let this get to press?"
3,A. Very. Long. Read.,"I have been trying to read this book for over 6 months. Although I do enjoy reading it when I do pick it up to read, I find I get bogged down with the writing style of that day, with stories inside stories inside stories. I find myself thinking ""Hurry up!!"", but that's my personal view, which I know is biased based on my perception on the movie adaptation (starting Jim Caviezal). I'm determined to finish it, although I keep getting distracted with other, quicker-paced novels."
3,"The book is depressing, the movie is much better, go see it!","I love the Musketeer stories, but this one was rather depressing and lacked the same feel of ""high adventure"" that the first book had. The movie, which I must warn takes a great deal of license, had a much better feel of the swashbuckling high adventure you expect from the musketeers. I wish it weren't so, but that's how I see it."
4,alright,"In this final chapter to Dumas's 3 musketeer saga, it tells the story of each of their downfalls. I didn't really like it because they all had everything that they wanted(cept for porthos who wanted a dukedom) they didn't have the drive that they had in the first book or even in 20 years after. all in all a good book but if you're looking for a repeat of the first book you'll be disappointed"
3,Dumas threw us a soft ball with the closure of this series.,"As I think of this book it seems to me that Dumas may have changed his mind in the direction the story would take part way through writing the novel. I enjoyed the initial plot and throughout the rest of the book, I was waiting for the thread of that initial plot to be picked up and the tapestry completed. The way the book concluded didn't seem particularly inspired. The previous books were much better."
2,A Reference Grammar Not a Textbook,"If you are looking for a textbook, this is not the proper book. I hoped it would be a comprensive and grammatically intense text book structured like ""L'essentiel de la grammaire francaise"", where all the main grammar points are covered and well organized: usage of articles, nouns; tenses and moods of verbs; sentence structure, relative pronouns and clauses - all the topics that make up a grammar. This text is strictly a reference guide that often provides examples without exposition or statenment of the general grammatical rules. As a reference text, is is a somewhat poorly organized. Nonetheless, for someone who already knows Swedish, the book could be useful."
4,Expansion game map,"This is an extra game map for power grid. If you like the game, this is nice because you can change it up a bit."
5,Strong album,"This album, like all Isbell albums, is strong from front to back and leaves little to skip. There's a variety of material to prevent the album being typecast as a particular character. If you like his other albums, or his past work on DBT albums, this one also has absolute gems that are waiting to be discovered. Highly recommend."
5,Listen to this!,"Jason Isbell is on the cusp of ""majordom"" A fine singer/ guitarist, quality songwriter, this is a great 1st cd, or any cd, if you love music, real music, buy this, and tell other people to buy it too!"
3,An invitation into the homes of collectors.,"This book is inspiring because it shows us the homes of many collectors of paintings.It is well written, but there are not enough new ideas that can be incorporated by the reader. Some of the collectors have little idea on how to display their paintings in a way that is pleasing and justifies the works. Many of the dispalys are cluttered and claustrophobic. Yet, there are some splendid homes that incorporate paintings spectacularly. The article on Dorothy and Herbert Vogel is very moving. These extra-ordinary people deserve a book just on them."
3,"light and cheap feeling, but does the job","I use an Intous 4 at work, and have a 2 at home. I love the feeling of the 4's pen. The replacement for the 2 ,however, is really light and feels kind of cheap. It works well enough though."
2,"Good Pen, but where is my order!?","The review is more for Amazon and UPS. The pen itself is 5 stars as I've used it before. But where on earth is my order? First I ordered the other classic platinum pen. That took ages to ship out and therefore I canceled the ordered and bought this one. It shipped out 2 days after. I've used their super saver shipping before but honestly it's really slow now. Why not simply use USPS instead for small orders like these?While I really want an explanation why they are using UPS and also why they report a shipment is out for delivery since 7:42am but is STILL rescheduled for next day, I'm not optimistic I'll get an answer. I needed this pen a while ago and was skeptical of the overnight shipping from amazon (bad experience) but now their super saver is slacking off as well.I'll reconsider ordering from amazon again for time sensitive items until such shipping issues are resolved."
3,But It's Not Violet!,"Okay, this is very nice soap. Has a crisp, almost spicy fragrance. But it's not violet!Maybe the design of pansies pictured on the wrapper should tip us off, although this soap's scent does not remotely resemble Claus Porto's Wild Pansy soap.But, violet this soap is not. A pleasant item to have in the bathtub/shower, and anyone selling as well as buying would think that's assuredly a violet aroma since it's what the wrapper's name proclaims. Other soap manufactuers do indeed have their own version of violet -- whether it's Violette de Toulouse, Claus Porto Foxtrot, or the now defunct and much missed Puhl/Verly brand of Wild Violet. All differ slightly in essence, but they are all recognizably violet.This soap's frangrance isn't."
5,Very comprehensive.,"Although I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is the best catechism ever written, it is certainly one of the best. Hundreds of pages covering nearly every topic of interest to lay Catholics. A good reference for clergy too."
2,Language learning...,"A bit hard to learn from the order of the instructions, but I have an issue with languages regardless. Book was in good condition and shipped fast."
4,Cute but Dribbly,"Great color, this lemongrass (celery green - my term) set brightens up your breakfast table & goes perfectly with your other Fiesta Ware. Just a note - the creamer dribbles after you pour. It's a design flaw not a defect peculiar to my set. So if you don't want your Irish linen table cloth dribbled on, try a different creamer. I'd buy it again; the cute factor overrides the dribbles. Besides, who uses Fiesta Ware in a formal setting? Just wipe the placement and you're good to go."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I was expecting more intriguing subjects, although I did enjoy some of the entries. Some were overly analytical; some were not interesting at all. I don't think it's worth the $9.99 price. I recommend waiting until the price drops before buying."
2,"Nice analog microphone, unfortunately...","It worked great the first few days but now it is picking up alot of static. I traced the problem to my laptops microphone jack. So even though this is a good microphone, is quality can be affected by its connection. My experience is that microphone jacks are not reliable when used for an extended period of time. I had to upgrade to a USB microphone."
1,PLANTRONICS MICROPHONE,"I bought this microphone to use with internet telephone. Most of the time it works okay, however, at other times the sound quality on the other end is terrible. A lot of static and fading out. I have considered returning it and purchasing another model somewhere else. I would not buy another one."
1,bad quality,"I expected good quality from plantronics m60, because of name brand.it works but as if it were a cheap chinese unit."
5,Corona bottle opener & catcher,Never look for a bottle opener again. And the catcher works prefectly. It also makes a perfect gift.
2,Unsatisfying.,"I really like the Boot Camp Clik and admire them for keeping their subject matter on realness and the battle ground mindstate, etc., but this cd just doesn't work. Some ""group"" cds sound like everyone really came together and put out their best effort - flipmode squad, def squad, wu-tang. This CD, on the other hand, is less like those and more like a compilation. It sounds like it was thrown together from unreleased tracks from old cds, demo songs of junior members, and a couple of other odds and ends. The production is a massive step down from the Beatminerz sound they'd used in the past, and is kind of watered down and cheesy sounding. A few of the songs, like ""okeedoke"", are good, but this CD should only be purchased after every single other release from any individual member of the BCC has already been bought, and you're still looking for more."
3,For True Fans,"Members Cocoa Brovaz (Smif-N-Wessun), Heltah Skeltah, O.G.C., Representativz and others led by B.D.I. (Buckshot) to bring hip-hop back. A major element that's missing from this release is the production of the Beatminers. The slow grooving jam ""Night Riders"" crept unexpectedly to a favoriate tune. The solo song for Louieville Sluggah of O.G.C. titled ""The Dugout"" is laced with a xylophone and a one, two kick. As simple as it is Louieville made a base hit with this one. ""Illa Noyz"" performed by Illa Noyz and Heltah Skeltah, could have been better without that hook, but they did thier part in bringing this release a fresh voice. The production is filled with a more live feel that maybe stripped it of its potency, yet titles like ""Rag Time"" is a jazzy/soulful jam where we get to hear Buckshot flow."
2,Just forget this album ever happened,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this album. None of the Clik shined as bright as they did when they were on their own albums. There were no kind of hip-hop quotables or hard beats, only some R&B-inspired production or ""safe-sounding"" hip-hop beats. I won't waste much time with this, because two reasons alone will tell true hip-hop heads why this album is bad: 1.) Da Beatminerz didn't produce anything on here, and 2.) the best rappers, Heltah Skeltah, were only on two or three tracks. 'Nuff said."
2,Partial performance,"PDF Producer creates PDF documents that can be read only by the most recent version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. For beginning computer users this is daunting, since sometimes they must be coached to on how to install the Acrobat program. Having to install 6.0 if they've installed an earlier version upsets them. The quality of the documents is good, though, but not searchable."
1,Did not get what I ordered.,"Did not get what I ordered. Instead got a double feature DVD, of which one of the movies was the one I ordered, and the other was an off the wall movie. Communicated to seller, but had a very hard time getting an answer. Sent the movies back, but still have not had any reply or refund yet. Definitely will not order from this dealer again."
1,Misleading information on DVD,"I thought that this movie sounded pretty good from the editorial review, so I purchased it.However, I was disappointed. Not because of the movie itself, but this movie states that it is ""closed captioned"" with the CC printed on the back cover. However, it is not closed captioned at all, yet all the other extras were included.This is not the first time that this particular DVD company has done this. If they are going to remember to include all the other extras, they could at least remember the captions.I do not think that I will be buying movies made by this DVD company again as this has happened more than once now."
1,"I stoped renting National Lampoon's movie, because of this turky flick","National Lampoon's Animal House, the first Van Wilder movie and the first 3 Vacation flick will always be my faviorts, and at the top of the list. But this along with others National Lampoons flick belong at the bottom of the garbage bin. I rented this about 3 years, and I don't know what I was thinking. I thought it was going to be a funny flick, but it was a campy flick. What made it so campy was that They had Will Friedle dressed up as a baby during a sex scean along with that crapy lollypop song that I can't get out of my head. What other National Lampoons movies can take a turn for the worst. The one thing I owe it to is Actor J.J cole, the black guy who plays the minster, and give the best advice at the end, and that is don't watch the ending because it gets creepy. Well thank you J.J Cole for your advice"
5,Cute Plushie,Is a really cute plush. I loved it.Only it was a little smaller than what I'd expected.Is about 8 inches long.
5,Excellent,I am a great Trisha fan and do have quite a number of her CD's. This is for sure one of her best.
5,Love this knife,"This is my 3rd CyberTool. I've used them to work on everything from computers to cars. Several years ago, we used one to remove and reinstall the fuel rail from a Jeep Wranger.Super versatile!"
4,"Like it, but wish it came with the manual",First of all - the tool is not super big... I carry it every day with me in the pocket of my jeans. The tool is well built (would not expect anything less from victorinox). The only reason why I have given 4 stars is because I wish the tool came with a booklet or even a piece of paper long manual - some of the tools that it has don't make sense to me...
4,Sign of the Times,"Oxymorons represents perceptions of the healthcare system at the time the book was written. When Kleinke wrote Bleeding Edge, many healthcare leaders felt that managed care was going to rejuvenate the healthcare system in the US. Oxymorons reflects the failure of managed care to deliver a fix to the system and the disappointment that everyone felt at the time. It should be read as a reflective work which chronicles a point in time. As such, it delivers an interesting perspective and one that is helpful to remember as we track the evolution of healthcare in the US."
4,bout it bout it,"this album is very good because it showcases a lot of the no limit roster nicely and has some very good guest spots by E-40/B-Legit, Brotha Lynch, JT the bigga figga, E-A Ski. My favorite track is Meal Ticket, that is some down south ghetto dope. It features 8ball & Mjg and UGK. This WILL be the best soundtrack you'll hear. Very good CD."
2,Pain's me to read.,"The Shape/bindery of the book is appalling. I can't believe someone thought it was a good idea to publish this book in this horrid shape. It's difficult to even open to read, and makes you look like an idiot when doing so in public. It's hard to take anything the Graphic Artists Guild says seriously when they created such a monstrosity of a cover and shape for a book that's supposed to represent graphic artist. I would recommend people find a PDF version or some other method of reading this book other then the paper version they sell."
2,brunton spork,This item was expensive and I put off buying it for a long time for that reason. When I finally did buy it I found that the connection between the bowl and the handle bent easily and would not stand up it's use as a fork. Better to buy either two items or to get some thing else. No significant savings on weight versus utility.
5,it lives up to the Editor's Choice,"I bought this one, and it lives up to the Editor's Choice.It is super light, no metallic taste. You might be able to find it cheaper than it is here.Only thing that you need to be aware of, it is will not pass through an airport security screening. Check it through in your bag that goes under the plane and it is fine, but if you are traveling to a place to go hiking, you can't carry it with you (it seem logical, but remember it folds up really small & you might over look it in your packing).It is the best hiking spork I have used."
1,Example With What Is Wrong,"Understand where I am coming from. In the past we'd get a DVD for about $15 when the dvd was released. In that DVD (even past Ice Age dvds) we'd get special features. Not anymore. Now you get a DVD with only the movie on it for $15 (remind anyone of VHS?), but if you want the Special Features you got to spend $8 more for that. To top it off, it's not like they don't have room for the special features on the Movie DVD. They give us another container...twice as much storage is required of the buyers. The Marketing Wizs at Dream Works then package this as the Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Scrat Pack and tell you that you get extra. YOU DON'T GET EXTRA. YOU GET NOTHING SPECIAL. INSTEAD YOU GET ROBBED. While I'd like the features on the Scrat Pack, I am not spending $8 more to get my special features. I'm boycotting and others should boycott this also. I bet if you look on the Scrat Pack there is about 30 minutes of material. What a rip off."
1,Rationality Please,"What is unbelievable to me is the fact that people have actually read this book and taken it seriously. I am shocked by how people accept irrational claims as fact. It seems those who support the claims in this book fancy themselves as critical thinkers who have made an attempt to question the answers. However,thinking critically involves examining the claims of others and rationally separating fact from fiction. Once you have allowed yourself to accept certain claims on the basis that these claims seem to be allowing you to enter into a realm awareness, you have faltered as a rational being. Re-read at least one page of this book and re-think the validity of these claims."
5,The most revealing book on mind control yet,"This is one of the spookiest books on the workings of the US government that has ever been written. Cathy O'Brien documents in great detail her nightmarish victimization at the hands of the CIA's project monarch, as well as numerous politicians and dignitaries, George Bush and Gerald Ford among the guilty. The book goes from her victimization as a child born into a pedophile ring, through her ""training"" and ""trance-formation"" under the watchful eye of her ""handlers"", as well as her rescue from a certain death by her now-husband, Mark Phillips. This book will give you chills.....you will find out what is really happening in America as you get a look behind the scenes at CIA drug dealing, satanism, prostitution and human experimentation. Creepy."
5,"PHENOMENAL, MOVING AND QUITE GRAPHIC EXPOSE.","I was moved to tears many times reading this detailed and horrendous account of Satanic Ritual Abuse and CIA Mind Kontrol (MK Ultra) perpetrated on Cathy O'Brien as a baby and upwards. The men and women that did this are in the highest positions of government and the Roman Catholic church today. (Dick Cheney, current U.S. VICE-President, is named as a key abuser and controller.) If you have a weak stomach, do not read this book. If you have a heart and are ready to be moved to give your life for those in need, as did Mark Phillips, then definitely read this book. Many facts contained in this expose of the filthy and powerful are corroborated in ""The Franklin Cover-Up"", by John W. DeCamp (Laywer and ex-State Senator of Nebraska)."
5,Shocking,"Excellent book, well organizaed and formulated. Story was easy to follow and written in a well chronological order. Cathy's story is gripping, with twists and turns that captures your full attention."
4,"Astonishing, riveting, horrifying","Wow. This book is basically telling us that our so-called leaders are really beyond evil, atrocious, diabolical and unspeakably vicious. It must have taken incredible bravery for Cathy to publish this. She must have feared for her and her daughter's life. I believe that she is telling the truth to the best of her ability and what is really scary is that I had no trouble picturing these famous men behaving this way. Please wake up America and don't swallow the version of life on earth as it's sold to you by your tv set. Start finding out about what is really going on. Knowledge is Power...seek the darkness to better know the light."
4,Un lmensaje para que toda la humanidad abra bien los ojos.,"Un libro a primera vista increíble y a la vez una realidad que afecta no solo a los Estados Unidos sino también al resto del mundo, un llamado de urgencia a la atención de los ciudadanos del mundo a abrir los ojos. El libro Trance: Formation of America, aunque lamentablemente no editado en castellano, impacta por lo crudo de su contenido y porque pone al descubierto la participación de ""grandes"" personalidades de diferentes sectores del gobierno Norteamericano en este proyecto de ""control mental"" a gran escala. Lo considero un libro de lectura obligatoria."
3,"Great Eye Opener, but poor quality craftmanship","I purchased this book for a Christmas gift for my mom. After receiving the book, immediately upon opening and reading, the pages start to fall out. Intuned to reading she takes a break and shows me the first 3 loose leaf chapters that have randomly fallen out of the book. The binding and glue didn't hold the book together properly. Instead of sending the book back she chose to keep reading since she has already started and has been waiting for the book awhile. She is 3/4 of the way through the book, with no better quality craftsmanship she now has at least half this book staying together using metal, black office paper clips.The book itself was an eye opener if one is unfamiliar with such devious acts. I do agree with the very first review, you may want to warm up to reading this book. I have no other complaints except for the pages falling out at random."
3,The Last Farewell,"Very Good cd, an issue regarding condition was sorted very nicely by amazon and title track was reason for purchase as it was true to my situation back before.A pity CD not inciculation as NEW."
3,disappointed,"Since the first book was sooooo good, I was excited to pick up the second one, only to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, just not as good as the rest. After her emotional night with Ben, Anna decides to go out with high school basketball star Adam. Their first date goes well, but Ben is still on Anna's mind, mainly because he's making a show of trying to get her back. The rest of the gang is along for all their problems."
2,my review,"i loveddd the a list and was looking forward to this book for the longest time. i found it to be the biggest dissapointment. the only good part was the final 5 pages! i am now looking forward to the 3rd book but this was all pages of boring information. i hated reading about sam at all, how she likes anna is just really weird. susan and cammie is all weird too. i thought this book was going to be alot more anna and ben but sadly it was just pages of unnecessary worthless information. it was not as good as anticipated at all. the third one better make up for this letdown.i guess i will just need to wait for the 5th gossip girl to make me happy"
1,Save your money.,"I know that this is suppose to be the rewrite of the Long, Tall, Texans story but it's just horrible! Why keep rehashing the same storylines as before?! The story was better in The Long, Tall, Texans so don't even waste your money reading about the same characters stuck in the same senerios they got over in the earlier book. This is just a way for Diana Palmer to make easy some easy cash! She had to have been intoxicated when she thought up this mess! I read it twice and it still made no sense. Trust me, spare yourself the headache and find another book to buy."
1,Dissapointed,"In other books Blake has tantalized with the possibility of a good romance but when his turn came, I found his story a dissapointment. It was the same for Dr. Coltrain & Cash Grier; the possibility of a highly charged romance was hinted at in stories where they had 'guest appearances' but it seemed that when it became time to tell thier stories Diana was tired of them and just threw a combination of old plots and contradictory situations together. Diana Palmers works are either very good or very bad and I won't spend the money on hardcover any more. I'll wait for the paperback."
2,I can't believe this is a Diana Palmer story.,"This story made me so mad, because usually in her books the woman is just as mule headed as the man. Now in this book Violet is a weakling who acts as if she can't go on without her boss. In all the other books that connect the characters of Jacobsville, TX the woman would have left the state to start over in another state. I can't believe that if her mother knew about his attitude she wouldn't have wanted her to be with him. This book just kind of let me down. I loved all over the other stories involving this series. I have read them time and again so I really hope the next book is like the others and not this one."
3,Boss Man,"It's was regular because she repeat almost the entire story of Jordan Powell,they are related but can bring something more new about Blake and Violet."
4,Who Am I? Who Are You?,"I am equal to my job title. But how do I define myself if I have no job title, no office, no employer?This may seem like an adult concern, but it's never too early for young people to begin evaluating questions regarding profession and identity. ""Working Title"" offers an opportunity for educators to prompt discussions with their students about, among other things, the nature of aspiration and self-definition.The old cliche is that children want to grow up to be firemen or doctors or nurses. It's time for a new conception of professional possibilities--one that includes artists. Educators will find that ""Working Title"" can be used with students of varying grade levels."
5,A must to read!,How can anyone read el subcommandante and not be moved? How can anyone just look at the plight of these people in Mexico and not feel rage at the injustice?
4,not do or die but it still rocks,"the boston boys are back with their new album and a new singer,al barr(from another boston band,the brusiers)my first feeling about the album was al was trying to be mike but after listening to it(and seeing them again-al really ounds like mike live)the albums grown on me.no it's not do or die but it's still good.the biggest disappointment on the album is only one song with bagpipes.oh well they make up for anything wrong on the album live!!!!"
4,New Album has more roots than you think,"Although the old Irish feel of Do or Die is lost with the new singer, After listening to this album for a few months, you discover the abundance of trad. Dropkick style.""The Fighting 69th"" has that feel as well as the fiddle in the ""Wheel of Misfortune,"" the bagpipes in ""Amazing Grace,"" and the irish styled ""Gangs All Here."" The one downfall on this album is the lack of good hardcore songs. ""Blood and Whiskey"" kicks maximum ass and is probably one of the best Dropkick Songs, but alot of them just drain on and aren't very melodic. But after listening to the album for a while (I didn't like it at first) you find the strong irish folk music mixed very well in half of the songs which you didn't notice before."
3,OLD DROPKICKS FAN,"The music on this album is great, but this band lost a lot of it's muscle when Mike McColgan left. The new lead vocal Al Barr is not able to fill the shoes Mike left behind. Do or Die was by far the best album put out by the band. My personal opinion is that the Dropkick Murphy's died when mike left."
5,What a great read,"The descriptions of some injuries may be difficult to those without a background in common athletic injuries (eg. buckethandle cartilage tear). But, this is a great insight into one team physician's experiences in the NFL. I would agree with one review that said he focuses on his drinking, but having limited exposure to the world of sports medicine, as a collegiate student trainer, this is very much a part of the atmosphere. He discusses the bonding of a medical staff in a bar setting, that hazy arena where information on potential players is shared and war stories abound.I would whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone that is even the slightest bit interested in the world of sports medicine."
2,Heater arrived defective,"When this heater came in, I read the instructions thoroughly and placed it into the aquarium with the temp. set to 75 deg. Within half a day, I noticed that the temperature shot up to 79 deg. Fahrenheit. Suspicious, I dialed the heater down all the way to 65 deg, waited half and hour, and checked to see if the heater was still on / emitting heat. It was still on. I immediately emailed the seller and asked for an RMA. After doing further research of this item, I noticed that this line of heaters have had quality control issues of late. So instead, I spent the extra cash and obtained a Marineland submersible 50 watt heater. I set it to 75 deg, and now my tank is exactly at 75 degrees."
5,I wished I had read this 15 years ago!,"I think this book would be great for Newly Married couples. Dont let the girly looking cover fool you. Its packed full of examples on how to treat others. In the intro it said ""the aim is to mark out duties and responsibilities of each member of the household..."" I really enjoyed it and will have my children read it too."
4,"these are a treat for Reich's fans (well, me anyway)","With the exception of a couple tracks, this cd is a great experience for me. It is a true tribute, and it's a whole lot more than a dance beat slapped on to Reich's phrases. Most of the djs really got inside of these pieces, I believe. I hope Mr. Reich enjoys them as much as I do."
3,Prefer the old edition,"I have used the old edition for a class in computability and logic where the students did not have much background in either. Having used the new edition this year, I find I greatly prefer the old one. The new one may be more rigorous, but it is much harder to read and understand for students without the background. The first part is not so bad, but the second half on logic gets too involved in the proofs and the students lose sight of the overall pupose and what these result really mean."
3,fascinating period and woman,"Mitford was a writer who specialized in describing the intricacies of court life at Versailles , from fashions and decorum to architecture and romance. She was not quite as adept at the political situation of the time; while she doesn't gloss over it, there is no pizzazz in discussing. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book very much. It's colorful and conveys a sense of what Madame de Pompadour endured to become the most powerful woman in France and how she gained that power by being not only beautiful but very intelligent and alluring."
4,EMPRESS OF FRANCE,"Lord knows the Bourbons had a history of powerful courtiers, but Pompadour is in a league of her own, she had enormous influence over the king, Louis XV, and she wielded her power with great agility. She was feared and respected throughout the court, everyone knew she had the kings ear and heart. This is a fascinating book on this exceptional woman, she eclipsed the king and many more books have been written about her than the king and he outlived her and he reigned for fifty years over the most powerful country in Europe, but it was she that was memorable. I wonder what Louis would thought about all of this fuss over his mistress, we know what Pompadour would have thought....devine."
4,Fixxed,"Easily the best Fixx album front to back. ""I'm Life,"" ""Shred of Evidence"" and the title cut are outstanding. Too bad they lost their ""edge"" soon after."
1,Very frustrating ........................,"The author does not let the stories speak for themselves. I found many questions arising about the strangeness of the stories, but no attempt was made to answer them. And because there is no probing reflection applied, some stories look contrived. Strangeness that is not scrutinized just looks like someone seeing what they want to see.The stories read as if all involved enjoy being mystified and have no interest in rationality and understanding. In fact, one story seemed like a pathetic justification, born of regret.The author says, ""...I have no explanation for these strange romantic encounters."" There is no indication anywhere that he tried to find one, and plenty of weight of evidence that he actually tried to avoid one. Otherwise, guess what? Maybe no book!"
4,Not bad,"I bought this product not really knowing what to expect. I haven't been taking it longenough to say I feel any physical benefit, but it does have a decent taste."
3,What if it happened to you - would you know how to react?,"When I lived in the Canadian Rockies, one mile from the Continental Divide, I didn't have far to drive to see huge cuts in the trees of the mountains where an avalanche had come crashing down the mountains. Although some of this movie is obviously special effects, it does give a good idea of the power of a large avalanche. The main reason to watch this movie, especially for children or teens who ski, is not to frighten them, but to give them time to think of what they could or should do if they find themselves in an avalanche. The is also about a seventeen year old girl who is trapped with her stepmother in the rubble. Because it is a TV movie, some of the plot line are a bit trite, but the movie does keep your interest, and there is no bad language at all."
5,"A Fascinating,Fictionalized Account","I understand that this is a novel. But I must say this. Personally, I am sorry that this woman didn't live longer to do what she wanted to do, but God knew best. I got a couple of latest novels, and this one keeps drawing me back again and again. I don't feel this cheapens the life of such a beautiful person. To tell the truth, there isn't much on this woman as is,but, with this book, you can get a insight on how this woman lived, how she started an empire by seeking to alleviate a problem of her own To me and anyone, that is an inspiration. This book should be read by every sister out there who have had hard times and been through the mill. They can look at this and feel some hope."
2,CORRUPTED DATA - LOSS ALL PICTURES,"I have some minor problems once in a while like it displayed a message of memory problem but during my last vacation I took about 150-170 pictures in the first few days. Suddenly i get those memory messages and finally I got ""Corrupted Data"" and that was the end. I couldtn't view or download my pictures anymore. I have to purchase a new 512MB this time i bought ScanDisk at Radio Shack for 60 dollars.It works fine when it works but then it doesn't work anymore and it's all gone.Let's see if I have better luck with ScanDisk ..."
1,At first I was sort of pleased...,"It works great for about 2 minutes, but then the distortion starts and I have to disconnect and call back without the headset. This has happened so consistently that I rarely pick it up. It is also uncomfortable to wear."
3,Broken ear loop,"I have not yet purchased the Plantronics headset. It looks very much like the Nokia and I had the same problem with the earloop breaking where the ring snaps onto the headset. Super glue does not work (and doesn''t on many plastics) but there is a simple solution. Purchase a bag of heatshrink tubing at Radio Shack. Pick a size that just slips over the broken ring, work it back over the other side and heat (I used a propane lighter, carefully!). The repair has held up for over a year."
5,Mangoes and Quince: A novel,"I loved this unpredictable story about exotic places and people and food, hauntingly beautiful,fabulous and bazaar... food and characters that jump off the pages ...I read it years ago and re-purchased it so I could read it again. I'm thinking it should be made into a movie...it is a bit dark in spots, and a little twisted...warning to the faint hearted...:) I'd like to read what others have to say about this book."
5,West Coast Bad Boys a classic,"Master P is a genius this has to be one of the best cds I own, I also reccomend West Coast Bad Boys Poppin Collars."
3,Master P is good but not very good!!!,"This is an OK CD but Master P really needs to stop saying 'UHH' all the time, track 2 would of been the best song of the album if it wasn't spoilt by that enoying word. It is a very hardcore album and worth checking out. Overall it really needs a lot of work to compare it to the top albums."
3,read it did not skip and it DOES!,I am very displeased with what I got! Usually everything is in tip top shape. This is the first dissappointment I have had. The c.d. I purchased skips on every song!
4,The Truth,"I usually hate this type of rap, and grantid this is mad corny childish type stuff...But can anyone argue with just how ill songs like ""Pass the Green"" and Boutit Boutit"" are? Naw."
4,"#6,#10,and #11 are the best songs on the CD.","This cd was one of the best of Master P's prodution yet. No LIMIT gives the world a real look how it really is out there, and dosen't drama ties it..."
4,This is a pretty crunk cd to buy so go out and buy it today,THIS CD GHETTO D IS A TIGHT CD. BE SURE WHEN YOU GET THIS CD TO LISTEN TO GANGSATAS NEED LOVE TOO AND BURBONS AND LACS THOSE ARE THE 2 BEST JAMS ON THERE BUT THE WHOLD CD IS GOOD SO MAKE SURE YOU BUY THIS CD . AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANKS TO MASTER P FOR MAKING THIS CD SO THAT US THUGS/THUGIRLS AND MORE COULD LISTEN TO YOUR SONGS . I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE PROPS TO ALL THE HOMIES AND HOMEGIRLS THAT DIED AND TO MY CITY HTOWN KEEPING IT CRUNK AND TO MY TAGGING CREW CNS AND TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT ALL MUSIC AND MAY ALL THERE SOULS REST IN PEACE LIKE MY #1 RAPPER 2PAC ETC.AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HI TO MY BABY BRETT OR MY HOMEBOY REY. PEACE LATERZ KEEP IT REAL!
5,Can't Stop P,"The whole No Limit Family needs to keep comin' strong with these bone shakin beats, and real life stories for their lyrics, they are the truest rappers out there, and its a shame that Master P said he ain't gon' rap no more, there ain't nobody like P."
4,Godwulf manuscript; emerging Spenser,"I'm a long time reader of Robert B. Parker. I admire his crisp writing style and have read at this point all of the Spenser novels. However I'd never read the first one, this book. The mystery was quite good but more interesting for me was that this was the first incarnation of Spenser and he is quite different than the character he evolves into by book three of the series. This Spenser is much more akin to the classic hard boiled P.I.s of Chandler and Ross Mcdonald. The distinct cadence, almost spare writing style that Parker evolved with Spenser isn't there yet but you can see it emerging along with the unique character of Spenser himself as he emerges from the behind classic gumshoes that inspired him."
4,"An early, grittier Spenser","As one who had read most of the series already, finding this one was a real treasure. So this is the first time any of us met Spenser! This is an early, pre-Susan Spenser who exhibits less conscience when dealing with the ladies but who is still an incorrigible wise-acre and a smart, independent, fearless PI. I missed Hawk, Pearl and even Susan, but still enjoyed this book for the window it gave us into Spenser's early development. BTW, his first name is Jim. (I'd always wondered about the first name thing. I mean, I knew he had to have one!)"
5,The beginnings of Spenser,"Spenser's first appearance is in ""The Godwulf Manuscript"". Robert B. Parker had difficulty in getting it published, but when it finally appeared in print, Spenser was an immediate hit with the reading public and remained a very popular character until the death of Parker. Spenser lives on, however, through the work of Ace Atkins, who has just come out with a new Spenser novel ""Lullaby"".If you are not familiar with the Spenser novels, I highly recommend that you pick one up from Amazon and enjoy Parker's character. The novels are fast, funny and exciting!"
5,"A smart, sexy, and strong character...","If you have not yet begun your own Spenser adventure, you're in for a real treat. Robert Parker has created a delightfully brilliant character in Spenser. He is a renaissance man - a great cook, philosopher, and a fighter. He is a ""lone wolf"", but with a deeper sense of humanity than most people posess. A good reminder that doing the right thing isn't always as compicated as it seems. If you are familiar with Boston, the trip is all the more familiar and realistic. Buy, read, and enjoy!"
3,Could be better,"Overall this is a good ablum, but it could've been better. The music is just the typical teenage rock style music with all the usual teenage issues. Nothing really deep and meaningful or with any serious political overtones.The only annoying bit about album is one voice. There's an out-of-place/out-of-key/out-of-tune squeeling voice in tracks #1 and #8 which spoils the music. It makes those songs almost sound like a [] garage production with some[body] who can't be trying to sing.All I can is get rid of that voice or at least ask her to stop singing or at least get some lessons, and this band will go much further. I would've rated this album 4-stars if not for that annoying voice!"
1,"Linda Perry's Latest ""Punk-Pop"" Act Is Lame","Yet another installment of The Great LindaPerry Swindle. These gals are so fakethat they make Kelly Clarkson look likeWendy O. Williams. If you're looking for somereal girl ""Punk-Pop"" go with The Go-Go's orSleater Kinney."
1,Worst Album ever made,i tend to give POP bands a chance as of everyone deserves oneall tho LILLAX is not a good band they are Manufactured. i saw them in a live show and boy did they not know how to play music they know how to sing but not to play insterments i dont think they even know how to tune a guitar or change a chord this album is the worst ones ive heard. if your looking for something your Parents will jam to buy this album and while your add it buy kids bop...as far as poser yes any one who is influenced by hanson is not punk. This album is Trash dont buy it buy albums from real punk girls like destillers because this is not punk this is Manifactured Feet smelling Donkey poo
3,KINDA GOES DOWNHILL!!!,THIS ALBUM IS ANOK ALBUM I EXPECTED IT MORE FROM THEM!!!!LET ME RATE SOME SONGS :1.invisible-I hate this songyou could barely hear their voices and their voices sound horrible 1/52.tommorow-its a good song that will grow on you 4/53.quicksand-this has got to be my second favorite song from the album it has a lot of attitude and its a very cool summer song5/54.dirty sunshine-3/5 not my favorite i usually skip this one5.its about time -6/5 my favorite its a very cool punkish with popish song. Great choice of being the first single!!!overall this album kinda goes DOWNHILL!!!
4,Good C.D,"It's been a long time since i got this album and i still like it enough to give it a four star rating. This album doesnt lose appeal very easily, which is the good part of the album. Not all the songs are good though, but the ones that are, are REALLy good.Dirty Sunshine, What I Like About You, It's About Time, Sick and Because are really really good.Tracks like Invisible, Quicksand and Tomorrow are alright. But 24/7 and Promises arent up to the mark. I have a song called 'Promises' and i'm told it's much better than the Lillix one. But other that, this album is very good.If you like Avril Lavigne, Ashlee Simpson, Skye Sweetnam, Alexz Johnson, Pink or Fefe Dobson, you'll love Lillix."
1,"This CD is only ""edgy"" for the Britney bubblegum pop crowd.","For the crowd that's grown up on polished pre-packaged blond pop stars and American Idol, then this CD is a good introduction into more original music. But it still falls flat next to actual rock bands. It's overly polished, with hum drum instruments and unimpressive vocals. The first seven songs are interchangeable, and the eighth simply sounds like they're trying to earn ""grrl"" status.After listening to it twice all the way through, there's not a single track I want to download onto my iPod before selling the CD at a used music store."
3,"Sure, their good","Ths chick band can sing and play, but I would improve on the bass and maybe drums. I think it's a little poppy, but that's okay. If you are looking for a band that concentrates on voice quality, it's Lillix. The guitar playing is pretty much professianal quality. I didn't like the song ""Because"" and most of their lyrics don't really make sense. But their good enough if you want some good melodys to sing, or if you want to fill your pop-rock collection."
5,"I LOVE this video! Great workout, Awesome mindset!","like the other reviewers, I sweat like crazy and got a great workout. But the real power in this video is in the way the postures are put together--they just make your body feel great and jonathans' attnetion to breathing keeps reminding you what its really about--finding a great workout, yes, but also creating a stillness in your mind. ive done all of baron's and jonathan's videos. sure there are similarities, but, in my mind, fields has taken the practice to a new level. ps-for the reviewer that thought there was no energy on this tape...maybe you should look inside to find out where the real energy void may be coming from--this video was pure energy not just to me, but to every friend i have, we all do it together. for those who are interested, ther's also a beginner and advanced practice tape at the studios main website (sonic yoga) last time i checked.Buy this video right now and use it every day!"
2,The plummet continues,"I've been a fan of (hed)pe for years now; by far 'Broke' has been their best album. The last few albums ('Blackout', 'Only in Amerika', and 'Back 2 Base X') have continued to get worse, and this trend has continued with 'Insomnia.' I'm not sure what has happened to their ability to write lyrics or their ability to make a cohesive song/album. Each song starts out promising, good beat and what-not, but then the downward spiral begins. Each song seems like 3 or 4 extremely different songs/beats/rhythms strung together, its pathetic. It seems like they have lost their direction completely. I'm also not impressed with the new political overtones they have in their music or the misplaced references to the free masons. Overall I just felt the album was oddly put together, and I probably won't listen to it again (eventhough I bought it)."
1,poorly written and disappointing,"I agree with an earlier reviewer about this book being poorly written. That said, the biggest disappointment is that the author fails to observe one fundamental truth: that Castro was pathologically obsessed about not being upstaged or replaced by any other Batista opponent. His monomaniacal motivation was to be recognized as Batista's top nemesis. If the city and university ""student"" revolutionaries had succeeded in killing Batista, Castro would have been left behind. He knew this and greatly feared it. He didn't cooperate with anyone except where it served his purpose.The sad thing is that this author is now one of the leading exponents of appeasement with the totalitarian regime in Cuba and part of a business and congressional leftist movement that stands to profit from trade with Cuba."
1,Intellectual dishonesty,"The author of this book certainly knows Cuba well and has been a strong advocate for constructive engagement with the Cuban regime for quite some time now which is commendable. Nonetheless her complete lack of objectivitity and intellectual honesty are evident from page one. In essence she is much too close to the subject matter and therefore compromised to offer anything credible on the topic. She is also excessively emotional in her obsession with all things Castro. The author once had the audacity to say that the only thing Castro wants before he dies is to be able to feed his people. What a farce! Anyone who wants to get ""Inside the Cuban Revolution"" should visit the island and not waste their money on this worthless propaganda."
2,Riddled with errors,"I grew up in Liverpool in the sixties, and I can tell you that the part of the book that deals with the early days is riddled with errors. Many place names and facts about Liverpool are incorrect. As a writer myself, I wish I had a red pen in my hand when I started the book, so that I could have marked all the mistakes."
4,Great! I enjoyed this one,"This book was a real page turner. I had a hard time putting it down. I learned much more about the Beatles. Some things I didn't want to know, but it was still well written."
3,"Interesting, but sloppy writing and inaccuracies give pause","If you want to get a feel for what it was like in Liverpool when the Beatles were, first kids, then later aspiring musicians, you can do no better than this book. But there is important information either omitted or glossed over, like the fact that Pete Best was asked to replace Ringo in The Hurricanes. The author has trouble with irregular verbs such as ""ring"" and ""run"", which does not command a great deal of respect. Nor could I do anything but cringe when he described the Beatles' visiting that famous old prostitute, Madam Tussaud, to see themselves in wax. Really: A famous professional writer, with book deals, and steady paying gigs, doesn't know the difference between ""madam"" and ""madame""."
5,A real Beatle Fan,"It is interesting that some of the reviews are not even close to the content of this book. This is the best biography yet. To read how the Beatles' music changed and how the songs were written is priceless. Reading about the families (John's especially), gave me real insight to who they became. Boring???? Not at all. I was there at the beginning of their fame and now I understand what they sacrificed for fame. I was never a screamer at their concerts and I'm glad of that now. This book is a must read......I could go on and on..."
5,Why Bob Spitz Rocks My World,"Ok, So Bob Spitz's new Beatles Biography has already received no small amount of critical acclaim. Does this mean that you should buy it? No, not necessarily. Just because the New York Times, Boston Globe, Time Magazine, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Chicago Sun Times, The Milwaukee Sentinel, The New Orleans Times-Picayune, The Miami Herald, The San Francisco Examiner, Newsweek Magazine, The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Denver Times, The Philadephia Inquirer, Entertainment Weekly, and every other reputable outlet for print media in this nation have whole-heartedly endorsed it doesn't mean you should jump on the bandwagon. Instead, just take my word for it: This book rules so hard that if it ruled any harder it would spontaneously combust goodness all over your stupid face. One love."
1,Historical inaccuracies abound,"Regardless of how readable and enjoyable the narrative, it is impossible to overlook major editorial/factual errors. How can the reader trust anything written when basic, elementary facts are incorrect. For example, one needs to look no further than the picture layouts contained in the book. Errors in the captions include: Brian Epstein sitting on the stage of the Cavern Club in 1964 (the Beatles did not play the Cavern after 1963) George and Pattie on the set of Help! where, according to Spitz, they first met (they met on the site of A Hard Day's Night March/April 1964) the 'gang'-including Pattie Boyd- at Paul's twenty-first birthday party (June 18, 1963), George met Pattie ten months later. The aforementioned examples are far from isolated. I counted at least 75 inconsistencies in the text, totally unforgivable for a biography."
4,compulsive reading about a great band,"I've read countless biographies of the Beatles, many of which are sensationalistic, or tend to focus on one aspect of the group (i.e., all music or all personal information or all rumors). This book, at a whopping 800-plus pages, is the best I've ever read. Spitz debunks common myths/speculations about the Beatles, and never veers too far into editorial territory. The book is well-written and capably delves into all aspects of the Beatles phenomenon, musical and otherwise. While I noticed that the photo section has a couple of errors as far as dating the images, they are easy to overlook. It's rare to uncover any fresh information, and this book is capacious in that regard. Don't let the length intimidate you--it's an insanely quick read. Very enjoyable."
1,Looks great but...,I finally received the Cello and I was impressed of the extras that came with it. However. I CANNOT keep it tuned at all. I keep tuning it like 6 times and it won't stay tuned. I'm putting everything back to the box and I'm returning this item.
1,Too Cute By Half,"I'm no stranger to the delights of sentimental childish whimsy, but Tru (real name: Archibald Mussburger) has overstepped the bounds of propriety and now wallows in pure infantile silliness. The insistent, cloying mawkishness of this, his sophomore outing (sickeningly subtitled ""Happy Snuggly Playtime Fun""), makes me positively ill. What is one to make of the first cut, ""Goofy Baby Poopy Pants"", with its rodomontadical ritardandi and endlessly reiterated descending tritones? Not to mention the embarrassingly inane lyrics (e.g.: ""Mommy likes me and not you, haha, poopyface!"") Truly disgraceful...and very disappointing! I somehow expected better from the foremost disciple of the late, lamented Ustad Mustapha Alaja Khan of the Mukhbar gharana.Young Mr. Mussburger has surely come a-cropper with this tacky coprophilic album. Better luck next time, Archibald."
4,Tight,"This is a hella tight album by TRU except it isn't as tight as all their other albums. But it is well worth listening to! The best songs are No Limit Soldiers, I Always Feel Like, I Got Candy, FEDz, Gangstas Make The World, Swamp N***a, Pimp S**t, TRU 2 Da Game, TRU ?s, Pop Goes My 9, and Torcher Chamber. Even though all of TRU's other albums are better, this album is tight as well! Buy it!"
5,NO LIMT THE WORLDS #1 F*C'N RAP LABEL,THESE TRU BOTHERS KNOW HOW TO STAY BOUT IT. THIS IS THE BEST RAP GROUP EVER. STAY BOUT IT YOU HEARD ME!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Thinnly veiled propaganda,"What disappoints me and prompts me to write this review, is that the author, who is considered the ""father"" of modern linguistics, who proposes that language is an innate human characteristic and not something developed from blank memory, misses the point that built into the language would also be manipulative characteristics to be used by the aggressive and greedy...or the pacifist...to reach their ends. What I expected upon buying this book, was an in depth discussion of the innate nature of propaganda.Instead, what I read was no more than a thinly veiled media manipulation exercise. Chomsky exaggerates the facts in almost all his arguments in order to rally people against the US government's aggression, himself attempting to achieve his goal through propaganda.How our innate development of language is also linked chemically to all of our various innate characteristics such as aggression, compassion, greed, and love is what I was expecting. All in all a big letdown."
3,"Good overview, but superficial","This short book is a good introduction to the notion of media control and the manufacturing of consent. Given its length, however, it necessarily lacks some depth and does not develop its arguments as empirically or logically as some might prefer. This book might best suit those who prefer a brief overview, rather than an in-depth exposition, of some of the core concepts in this area."
1,great multitool but it was very used when i got it,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! the tool seems durable but as soon as i took it out of the box i noticed it was used. dirt in crevices and some kind of brown stuff in the teeth of the pliers. is this legal? for someone to tell you that this is new and sell you something that is clearly used? the tool is fine but the seller is a con artist. dont buy from the seller. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! this maybe the last time i buy off amazon. no quality control!!
3,Pouch is not nylon,"Tool seems fine, but the description says it has a nylon pouch. The one I got had a leather pouch. I chose this one specifically because it supposedly had a nylon pouch. Not only that, but Amazon won't send a replacement, so I have to wait to get a refund before I can re-order."
3,Nothing beats Master Oyama's books,"If a compact pocketbook is what you're after, this is the book to have. It has some really good information on some key techniques, but is in no way a complete illustrated guide on Kyokushin Karate. Turn to one of Mas Oyama's books for that. Being a paperback it will wear much quicker than the more rugged hard cover books (Mas Oyama's). My review is based on my copy of this book which is from 1964 so it's quite old; perhaps newer versions are more durable and possibly updated."
1,Don't waste your money or sanity,"This is the 3rd and 4th D-Link product I have bought. Not one of them work properly. Media Centre took 8 hours to set up wirelessly and still requires manual reconfiguring, D-Link Wireless USB requires constant re-setting. Just received 2 x DCS900W Internet Cameras. First one set up reasonable easilly . The second one I have spent an entire 8 hours on, and still the D-Link setup software will not even recognise the hardware. Whatever you do - don't buy this product - or if you insist on wasting your money, make sure you have a hammer to smash it with after wasting days in futile efforts to set them up."
1,DLINK DCS-900 DID NOT WORK POOR TECH SUPPORT,"15 MINS TO SET UP 5 HOURS WITH TECH SUPPORT, NEEDLESS TO SAY CAMERA DID NOT WORK WHEN TRING TO VIEW IT FROM THE WEB AT A REMOTE LOCATION. TECH SUPPORT TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE NOT TRAINED ON THIS CAMERA, THAT IT WAS TO NEW, AND HAD ME DO EVERYTHING BUT MAKE IT WORK. THEY HAD ME UPGRADE MY DI624'S FIRMWARE PING THE NET AND JUST RUN ME AROUND WHAT A PAIN IN THE BUT. DLINK HAD NO CLUE AND NO ONE TO HELP ME. AM CALLING CORPORATE BUT NO ONES HOME.BY THE WAY I AM USING COMCAST (ATTBI) CABLE AS MY ISP MAYBE THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT BUT THEY SAY NO."
5,A Good Camera for Simple Security,"OK so the phrase simple security doesn't sound very ... secure, but having a camera that captures images every X seconds is a good thing. This camera can do just that. If you want a camera with lots of features and faster processor for true streaming, then you will want to pay a little more. Try the DCS-5300 series by D-Link as they perform great.This camera has Java or ActiveX controls, so the active X wont really work in firefox. Just an FYI."
2,dcs-900,"We have had this camera for a year now and between the manufacturer and the enclosed set-up literature, it is a disaster.Between the arcane set up references, no clear set up path, misinformed instructions, and clueless 'technical support' it is not for the faint of heart.Simply put: You had better be a geek to use it."
3,"Price is good, frames per second blows","If you are wanting nice smooth video, do yourself a favor and get the Axis 206 ip camera. I have a Mac, run SecuritySpy, and have two of the DCS-900 and one wireless version. This camera was easy to setup and get running out of the box (you most likely will need Windows for initial setup Mac guys but after that you can access it via Safari) but the video is choppy and I have tried every compression setting, frame rate, and option. It appears after reading on the web that the DCS-900 series is known for this problem on all operating systems.The cameras are used at my home for security purposes."
2,Disappointed with the flow of the narrative.,"The flow of the story is slow and gets to be uninteresting. Of course, I am used to reading Jane Austen, Philippa Gregory, Jean Plaidy and other similar books.It is well-written, though."
3,Great voice but...,...a Celine Dion bi-product. She'll never be as good as Celine but a hell of a lot more better than most singers out there. I predict that Lara will be Sony's next pop diva. Bonne chance Lara.
3,He Has Done Better,"This is my #1 author, but he missed it on this one. In fact, I really don't think Cussler put much into this book. I bet most of it was by the ""co-author"" !!! Just not anywhere as good as the previous books. No hidden surprises. Even the ending was dull. But, I will but his next book. We allow one mistake !!"
4,GOOD BOOK,IT WAS VERY INTERESTING BOOK. IT WAS ALSO MY FIRST KINDAL BOOK AND IT WAS VERY LOW PRICE. i was very suprised how fas the WiFi downloaded the book. GREAT!!
1,The novel with the most cliches wins...,"I found this book to be horribly unrealistic in every aspect. The dialog was corny, without an original phrase used by any character. I could perhaps forgive one character who is sarcastic and teasing all the time, but nearly every dialog exchange was full of cliches and sarcasm. And when the characters were being serious, they were melodramatic. There were too many coincidences which inplausibly dragged the plot along. Finally, the backdrop against the legend of Imperial Russia and the modern corrupt Russian businessman-mafioso was just the icing on the cake. I'm not a literature nazi, and I'm game for a pulp fiction read every now and then. But I should be able to enjoy a story without uttering ""oh, puh-lease"" every few minutes. I haven't read any other Cussler novels, but I'm not inclined to after this one. For a better read in this genre, try Ken Follet."
2,bad real bad ...,"I was surprised and pleased to see this book out, so I quickly bought it and raced home to read it. Now I wished I had that time spent reading it back! This is one of the least developed stories I have ever read.Mr. C has run out of gas, this is nothing but a Pitt novel with the names changed, and not a good one at that."
3,Dirk Pitt and Al Gordino in disguise,"It appears Clive Cussler has taken a boiler plate approach to writing his novels. He merely changed the names of his NUMA main characters.The writing was not up to the caliber of previous Dirk Pitt Novels. It appears Clive is just trying to cash in on prior accomplishments. The story lines have become extremely easy to forecast.I have read all of Cussler's novels. However, if they continue in this manner. I will no longer be interested in reading his new novels."
3,De Haviland Mosquito,"The attraction of this film is that it contains actual footage of the De Haviland Mosquito a famous British bomber of WWII. Although the special effects seem dated the footage is worth the price of the DVD alone. Seeing this film for the first time was the inspiration to by and build the model of Mosquito bomber, the true star of this film."
1,Bail out!,"The author should have made them stick to his story. A stunning bore of negligible proportions. Cliff Robertson leads a cast of ""who cares?"" Character development is grounded throughout the film. We are supposed to believe that the dark-haired George Chikiras is a Norwegian navy officer who also has a blonde sister (who is really Austrian) in England who happens to fall in love with Wing Commander Cliff Robertson. (Damn! Those Brits have snazzy rank titles, don't they)? The German Gestapo lady looks mighty sinister and androgynous. The only interesting thing in this film is the actual British airplane, the Mosquito. An avid flier, Cliff wanted to buy it from the owner who wouldn't sell. Watch this in a parachute harness. You might want to bail out."
5,633 Squadron a tribute to the RAF Mosquito squdrons.,The movie even though it depicted an ficticious RAF squadron it still showed what these amazing crews did with a wooden bomber. The movie was filmed at an RAF Station near my home in England. My father was based there in the late 40s and I visited the base many times. The movie was true in that the crew were taken from many nations of the commonwealth and also volunteers from the USA.
4,633 Squadron used DVD quality,"Saw this movie when I was probably 13 and I guess it made an impression as I remembered it-and that was awhile ago. I found a used book at our library on the plane in this movie, the Mosquito, and found it was pretty unique. So I thought I'd see if you had any used movies and you did. Nice watching this again. The DVD was a little scrambled a times, but the price was very fair (could be my player too) and nothing I couldn't view around. Nice getting the original artwork (I'm not a collector by any means though!). I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in the subject matter. From brief research, it seems there is interest (other movies have been made in the men who flew these planes and the plane itself."
2,"Functional, but looks cheap","When I purchased this as a gift for my father-in-law, I was a little embarrassed to give it to him. There was nothing wrong with it and it worked just as it said it would, but in person it looks kind of...cheap. Wouldn't buy it again and I wish I had gone with another item. (That was about 6 mo's ago and it's still working fine, just didn't care for it to begin with.)"
5,Not Nirvana! Not Nirvana!,"I am sorry....but these guys sound nothing like nirvana, new or old. They rock in their own right and IF they sound like anyone, they sound more like Alice in Chains...and there's not a thing wrong with that. :P Oleander is much more mellow than anything nirvana ever did. I can't wait to see these guys in concert someday. :) A highly recommended buy for fans of music like Alice in Chains, Creed or even Godsmack. Come to think of it, there's violins in Why I'm Here....that snagged me hook, line and sinker. :)"
5,Great Stuff!,I heard I Walk Alone on the radio and loved it! Every song on this CD deserves to be a hit. Do yourself a favor & buy it!
5,"Buy it for ""Why I'm Here"". Love it for the rest.","Absolutely the best CD I've bought in the past few months. All the songs on the CD are great, though some of them are a little too pop. I heard ""Why I'm Here"" on the radio, but I found that I really liked the other songs, especially ""Stupid"" and ""Lost Cause"".It's too bad that Oleander isn't getting the recognition it deserves."
2,Skip this Model,This model has no WiFi.This model has no camera.Skip it and buy the nice Nokia e61i or N95-3. They are far better choices.
1,Continual Disappointment,"Purchased this model for its file compatibilities (pdf,xls,doc,etc) plus the ability to take daily notes, writing. Also it was nice that one could select arbitrary mp3s as ringtones.The keyboard it has is fairly useless but a bluetooth keyboard eventually fixed that. However, getting notes and docs out of this thing is difficult. Drag and drop is not implemented (God knows why). Exporting text thru Outlook is the ONLY option as far as I can tell. major PITA.The sound quality is nearly incomprehensible, the only way it works well is on speaker phone.The operating system runs at a snail's pace, startup and tasks are very slow.To listen to MP3s on it, one needs to purchase special headphones.It has a tendency to freeze. Once it does, the only thing to do is to pull out the battery, replace it, and restart the phone.This is the worst phone I have ever owned. I will never purchase a Nokia again. Avoid it if you can."
2,Old Guy No Like,"What the heck makes this ""post rock?"" It sounds like second rate guitar rock to me, repetive in a boring--rather than blissed out--way, with dynamic extremes that sound gimmicky rather than cathartic, opaque production and uninspired playing (I hesitate to mention song-writing because these guys are a jam band). A hopeful prediction from the 47 year old guy contingent: you 20 somethings who are slobbering over this will eventually come to your senses and go after some REAL noise: Bardo Pond, Flying Saucer Attack, Spacemen 3, Amp, Jessamine, Loop, older Flaming Lips, MBV, Lovesliescrushing, or maybe even the Stooges or MC5. If you insist on the post rock thing, Sigur Ros or GSYBE. Again, this is just mediocre, at times mildly inspired, guitar rock."
4,What about the electric cars ???,"While I agree with the other reviewers that the question is well posed, but I just could not help wonder why the author had discounted ""electric car"" (not hybrid) but ""electric cars"" that consumers can charge just like their cell phones? Would that not help decrease our dependence on oil ?"
3,Wide Ranging Overview of Energy,"Tertzakian provides a useful, historical, and wide ranging look at all the world's energy sources. He starts with the stories of how 'rock oil' replaced whale oil for lighting and why Churchill converted the Britsh navy from coal to oil even though Britian had lots of coal and no oil. In a graph of US oil comsumption plotted against real GDP he shows the dramatic and permanent impact the 70's oil price increases had. After a chapter on the search for oil and the implications of dwindling new finds of oil, he speculates on how the world's energy mix will need to adjust to the upcoming peaking of 'light sweet crude' by the development of ""alternate energy supply chains"" like liquified natural gas and the Canadian oil sands."
3,Oil Break Point,"I enjoyed this book. Mr Tertzakian knows something about oil. I don't share his optimist views of the future. Heavy sour and Tar Sands will not save the world, yet, overall Mr. Tertzakian is a smart man and I enjoyed reading his book. Regards, Keith Renick, Project Materials Specialist, Project Management Team, Riyadh Refinery, Saudi Aramco Oil Company, Retired"
3,dis-appointed,we hoped it would have been bigger.i guess for $100 we should have known the deal wouldnt be that good.it was the right height but was too slim and not too full.the description was deceiving.now next year we have to buy another bigger better tree and give this one to someone who needs a tree.i guess i have to be more cautious.
3,Case Studies of Interdenominational Conflicts,"The book starts with the BEM (Baptism, Eucharist, Ministry) document published by the World Council of Churches in 1982 as the basis. Without reiterating much of it the book calls for ecumenism among Christian denominations. It presents twelve case studies that illustrate issues that have come up between churches, questions for discussion, and possible solutions. Examples include the issues of ordained female priests between Episcopalian and Anglican churches, baptism in the Holy Spirit between Baptist and Pentecostal churches, and who partakes in communion in Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. The book was a little informative, with perhaps too heavy a sell of ecumenism. I would find a book that compares doctrines -- which this does to a very limited extent -- more useful."
1,Satire at best!,Translation's of this type are highly questionable!One good thing to come out of this book is that we can still rely on the like's of Peter Masefield and Mrs Rhys D to publish unbiased translation's of the Buddha's teaching's!Elitist in the Extreme - Makes one wonder if Fanaticism has any place in the world of Buddhism
4,does the job,It's an extension cord. It does the job and is quality made. 4 stars only because it's a bit pricy for what it is.
4,Battery Tender 081-0148-25 25' Quick Disconnect Extension Cable,"This works well, but there is a very slight difference in the connector with my charger & another accessory plug I have for my BMW motorcycle. This is just in the length of the cover on the protected side of the connector (~1/16"" longer on this cord than either of the others, so you get a tiny gap on one side when connected)Using this with:BatteryMINDer Battery Charger / Maintainer with Desulphator - 12 Volt 2/4/8 Amp, Model# 12248BMW Motorcycle Charger PlugCertainly not a big enough issue to worry about!"
5,Darol's Opinion,This 25 foot long piece of wire is hardly an item to wax poetic about but here goes. It does just what I wanted it to do as an extension chord.
4,Extension Cable,"This cord works, I don't know what else to say about it. It twenty five feet long, and it fits."
1,jw,"very disappointing ... never even got to watch it ... was ""advertised"" as Closed Captioned for the deaf ---- it was NOT ..."
2,Warning: they changed the product,"A couple years ago, I purchased a Werner 223-6 step ladder. It had a great, very easy to use red release button in the middle of the top step. I liked it so much, I just bought another one. Same exact model number. BUT, there is no release button. Now, you have to jerk the top step up to get it to close... Compared to my old one, the new one is very hard to use. The picture shown on Amazon is of the OLD version, not the one you will get if you order this."
5,Rugged and Non slippery,This is a rugged and non slippery mini ladder. Works well in tiled floor and carpeted floors. It reaches up to top of my kitchen cabinet and very nice. Easy to fold and store away in the side of refrigerator.
2,Heavy and NOT Aluminum,"This was heavier than I expected an aluminum product to me. I took a magnet and checked the entire frame and determined it's painted steel except for the plastic steps. So the Amazon description is false advertising, and this 223-6 step ladder is neither light nor rust proof. Of course, like just about everything, it's made in China. Found this at another site: ""Product Description From the ManufacturerThe 3-foot Werner folding steel utility step stool, is lightweight and ideal for the homeowner. The foldable step stool is a three step model that has a convenient hand grip, comfortable tubular rail and a oversized slip resistant steps. The feet are mar-resistant so your floor will not be damages. Folds flat for storing. The load capacity is 225lbs."" Apparently Werner found it more profitable to change from aluminum to painted steel."
4,Perfect size,I use this almost everyday to reach things that are on top of the shelves in my pantry and for changing light bulbs. And it is very safe.
5,LOVE this 3-tier step stool,"This was a GREAT purchase. It is so sturdy and stable, easy to unfold, and it stores so perfectly behind the refridgerator. Me, my husband, and kids use it even more than we thought we would when we bought it. If it doubt, buy TWO! Good quality and value for the money!"
4,Braceface-13 Episodes,"There is a good thing and a bad thing about this boxed set. The good thing is that it has the first 13 episodes of the first season in 2001. The bad thing is that it is the episodes already released on the other single DVD's, with the exception of the last 4 episodes that are exclusive to this DVD. If Braceface fans want to see the remainder of season one on DVD and the unreleased season two episodes released, this is a must-have then because the other seasons aren't coming to DVD unless this boxed set sells good. I would definitely buy this set, even though I have the complete series taped from when it used to air on ABC Family, I am still going to buy this. Hope it sells good!"
5,Braceface DVD,"The DVD was in perfect condition, still sealed and with the original artwork just as the description said. Delivery was much quicker than I expected and the product exceeded my expectations!!"
2,Not that great for me!,"This was sent to me right on time! Thank you. But I must say this is too hard to use,especially on my face! OWWWW! but I think I will try it again. If I get another friend to help me with it. Thank you very much for sending it.Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit, for Face, Brows & Bikini"
5,Great for eyebrows,"I've been using this product for years for eyebrow waxing. I don't know how great it is for other areas, but great for eyebrows. After cutting the shape, warm up the strips with a hair dryer and quickly pull strips apart, put on the area of the eyebrow to be waxed, wait about 30 second, and pull. Does it feel great? No. Does it get every last hair? No - but pulls the great majority and I do some minimal removal with a tweezer. But its so simple and easy and I think it looks salon professional. I've had compliments on my eyebrows."
4,SH wax strips,"I think this is a great product. I had been getting Brazillians professionally done over the summer and once it grew out again, I decided to give this kit a go. It worked sooo well, I was surprised! The only thing is that I have to get another kit to finish the rest but for 5.60 a pop thats not a problem. Beats $59.00 at the salon. Also, it was a bit sticky but the finishing oil included took it right off."
2,It's a woman's product...,"Which is to say, if you are a dark-skinned male with coarse hair it probably will not work well for you and cause you mild to moderate annoyance trying. It's for finer hair and skin."
3,Eh,"This product does not always get all of the hair off in the area it is put and needs to be used repeatedly in one spot. For me, this product worked about half as well as it should have but can suffice if you have a couple hairs under your brow you want gone."
4,Works great; read instructions,"Really easy to use, convenient, and no mess whatsoever. BUT, the strips are VERY sticky, so handle with care. I got overzealous and waxed my upper lip a few times in the same spot trying to remove a few stubborn hairs that I should have just tweezed and took off a little bit of skin which left a red splotch and very light scab for a day. BUT, if you follow directions--these work like a dream--I use them on my 12-year-old daughter, just in the very middle of her brows to get rid of unibrow (at her request, not my suggestion!) And it's over in seconds with no lasting effects."
5,Very good scan and layout quality,"I have bought several ebooks within the free collections, and seldom I have found an (almost) error free text like Le mariage de Figaro. Very good work!"
3,"It is a CD of mostly ""shows"" a few ""Places"" and no ""Wins""","For a true George Strait fan, each CD is a must have, but this release lacks punch and contains no signature songs. A few of the tunes are just rehashed beats of tunes gone by. I LOVE George Stait's music...but only like this CD."
3,It works but ...,It is pretty tiny and cheap looking . Guess that's why I paid $ 5 for it . But a good working phone . Nice if you have to have a red phone like I did for my kitchen .
3,Inexpensive and practical,It is inexpensive and works the way it is supposed to. The color is just as it is on the website. The ring tone is a little annoying though.
3,Missing Something,"Given the lineup of players I couldn't see how it would miss but it does. That's not to say it's a bad CD ... it just doesn't have the loose but intense swing that, say, the ""Basie Reunion"" or ""For Basie"" or ""The Modern Art of Jazz"" (Zoot Sims) have."
4,"I like it, and will probably buy another one sometime in the future.","I bought this jump rope four months ago for the warming up routine at my kickboxing class, and it has worked wonderfully. By that I mean that it is not broken (something that unfortunately happens a lot with jump ropes), and that it allows me to do different kinds of drills, from beginner to advanced, without trouble. This jump rope is not heavy, its price is ok, and it looks nice, something that shouldn't matter but does :)Lots of pros, and only one con: if you hit your arms with this rope while you are doing speed jump rope drills, it hurts, and it hurts a lot. My advise? Wear a long sweatshirt or something else that covers your arms until you get used to new exercises.All in all, recommended."
2,Handles are terrible,It's a great size to use. Not too short or not too long. Just right for any average size boxer. The only problem is that the handles are terrible. They hurt your hands. Gotta protect your hands so I would not recommend this. One of the stickers on fine print says that it may cause cancer. Just fyi.
3,eh,"The seller did their part and I got the jump-rope in a few days. I do not like this product. When jump-roping, it comes around at you like a whip. I have a nylon rope that I use and it works great. This one has a thin plastic rope and you must wear shoes. I jump-rope in the house with socks. Since I live in a cold climate place, it is my main exercise if I don't want to join a gym."
5,Great lens,"The Tokina is an awesome lens. I'm not able to compare it to the Nikkor, but for what I use it for, it gets the job done very well. It's an awesome lens, and on my D50, you can really capture such a wide scene. It also focuses a lot closer than any of my other lenses.I would certainly recommend this to a friend."
3,"Inexpensive EQ, OK but not great.",I was looking for an inexpensive eq to make some adjustments for live music & recordings and to make some room corrections. This works great. I am using XLR connections so I can't confirm the other feedback about the rca jacks being undersized but I can agree the quality control is not very good. The level knobs have a stop which I assume was to be in the center (50%) position but one is just short of center and the other is around 40%. Not an issue for me as my room forces one speaker to be closer to my normal listening position so I have them adjusted accordingly. I would return but it works perfectly and has a simple clean look. Bypass is clean. I would rate 4 if the knobs were aligned properly.
2,"High Potential, Low Delivery","The title is provocative, the story line is very promising, but the book ended up only so-so.Peter is so cute, earnest, and funny, but he seemed a bit one-dimensional in his pursuit of Leslie. Katherine Deauxville didn't reveal much of his personality. I could not for the life of me figure out why he was so head over heels for Leslie, who seemed pretty uptight and lacked character and vivacity.Overall, there were a handful of drop-dead funny scenes, but pages of drawn-out prose and descriptive scenes of high-society DC life in between. Around 120 pages into it, I was disappointed to find myself looking at how many more pages there were until the end. It was tough to finish, but the ending was pretty cute.Really, this book was a mixed bag. There are better ones out there."
1,Hated this book!,"Yuck! I was excited about this book. I mean the title makes it sound wonderful, so does the back cover. It was horrid. I kept wondering where the romance was? It was BORING! I felt like it more of a book about the heroine and her mental problems. The hero and the heroine spend out five minutes in each others company and they are supposed to fall in love. Yeah right. I'm sorry I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I think I even threw it across the room a few times."
1,It seemed like a good idea at the time,"Whoever wrote the back cover of this book did a great job. They make you want to read this book. Unfortunately, the book itself does not deliver on this promise. The characters are two dimensional and flat. Leslie, the heroine is one of the most irritating creatures I have come across in a long time, childish, hysterical and just blah. Most of the time I felt like smacking her upside the head and telling her to grow up! The leading man is no better. He is totally trite and always clueless. I could not bring myself to care for these characters at all! Further, the writing itself is long-winded and bulky. Many of the scenes and dialogue add nothing to the plot. If you are looking for a fun contemporary romance with snappy dialogue, a good story and characters that you can care about try Carly Phillips."
2,Could have been so much better...,"This book left so much to be desired. It had a great idea, and I thought for sure it would be a good one. I had several big problems with this book. The hero and the heroine are actually in this book talking to each in only a few scenes. There was so much interaction between the heroine and other people--or there were just paragraphs of prose. There were so few scenes with them together and the ones that were there were very short. With a book like this, I didn't understand how either could fall in love because I never felt like they even knew each other.To end on a positive note, the few scenes where they were together were quite cute and funny. Too bad there wasn't more of them."
2,The sizes are not accurate,I ordered a size small however there small is more like a large for any other retailer. If you want this item to actually fit you properly go with a smaller size then you normally wear.
2,Does not work on New Computers,"Unfortuantely, my little one was disappointed because this product does not work on her new gateway computer. It is not compatiable with the newer software. Totally not the sellers fault but still disappointing."
1,doesnt work on xp,very let down doesnt work on xp computers it wouldnt work on my computer and my computer is only 3 years old
1,Do not buy this game!!!,"I was looking forward to getting this game. However, it was a huge dissapointment. First of all, the story mode is way to easy and only took about 2 days to beat. Secondly, the action sucks, the fighting is too easy because there is a auto lock that make enemies die quickly. The purpose of the game is to make you fight together with your droid, but you can easily get thru the game without really using the droid combos.Overall this game is a huge dissapointment."
1,"Jack of all trades, master of none","I love the optical zoom, fit, finish and feel of this camera. However, when it comes to pictures, I was unable to get even one clear picture. My 6-year old Olympus D490Z 2MP camera takes much better pictures than this one."
1,This camera is a trouble maker,"I brought this camera on Sept.25.2006.First, the power button does not function. Amazon replaced a new one quickly, No dault, Amazon had a good responding.by December, this camera was no need power button at all, the screenalways shows ""one moment"" or ""remove usb cable"" as long as put batteryin the chamber. I have to send it to repair center and pay the shipping fee. It is really sucks. You can imaging what this camera's futurecould be."
2,Works half way,"At first this looks like a great addition to a Thomas layout. But you have to remember that it says ""Cargo Drop."" The crane picks up a cargo item off of the roof of the building and then drops it into the car below. Remember, it does not lower it all the way, but ""drops"" it in. The crane will then not lower down enough to pick up the cargo out of the car. It has to be done by hand. That was a major disappointment. My four-year-old son got frustrated with this. We now use the swiveling cargo tower as a water tower. It lowers just enough to serve that purpose well."
4,Hot Rods,"We just DJ'd a ""Car Cruise"" in our area. Not only did we enjoy the songs on these cds, but most of the people in the crowd were jammin' right along with us. The ""Rev Off"" between the '41 Merc and the '61 Chevy was AWESOME! We used it as a contest. Actually had someone able to guess both vehicles! If you are a DJ, and play at any car shows, this is a must have!"
4,Great presentation & insight - music fair,"Smarter old people will tell you that there were no good old days. Listening to four CDs worth of hot rod music will cement that in your brain forever. Like any genre of music, that about hot rods bore some classics (Hot Rod Lincoln, Little Deuce Coupe), and a lot of junk that's hard to listen to. This collection has a full range from the great to the awful -- a true historical perspective. This release's packaging, however, is only top rate (no junk). Very creative, and it helps make it a collectable. The essays included in the accompanying book give you a look back in time that will help even the non-hot rodder understand what all the fuss over chrome and burning rubber was all about. When I received the set, I was really hoping it would include a song called ""Chicken"" (I can't remember the artist -- I was less than eight the last time heard it), but perhaps one of you might know where I could lay my hands on it. Happy listening you hot rodding fools!"
4,"An important book in the history of Islam, Africa and the Americas","An important book and a rare one in that it explains the history of a slave revolt in Brazil in which Islam played a prominent role. The author goes into detail concerning the conditions that slaves (and freedmen) lived in Brazil, how then interacted with one another and how they maintained their culture in extream circumstances.It is interesing in that the actual revolt itself is given considerably less space in the book but the supression of the revolt and the effects that it had on Africans in Brazil is discussed in detail.An interesing read especially in that it sheads some light on African culture in the Americas and how Africans maintained their culture there and also the efforts that white slave owners and the white population in general made in supressing that culture."
4,s-video cable,I bought this cable because I was converting some VHS tapes to a digital format. It appears to do a good job. I'm spoiled with HD and analog to digital still looks analog.
1,never recieved correct item,ordered this product recieved something else a poor grade cable conector with the wires all bent. wrote to company never recieved response. I would think twice before i buy from this company.
2,The Unsatisfied,"I read this book thinking that it would be an epic. I was very wrong. I give it two stars so that it can claim it's dignity, but I will not be as easily swayed in this review. As I read, I felt that it was all playing up to something, something huge! But at the end it was like a bad movie... like the director got tired. If you wish read a multicultural book read Roll of Thunder Hear my Cry, or My Brother Sam is Dead. Do not read this book!"
1,Read first before you read it to children !,"I read Slave Dancer to my 9 and 11 year old sons. I selected it because it was a Newbery award winner and I wanted to read a book about slavery. Oh My, although we did read the whole book it was outrageous. It was too horrifying and it made my kids feel sick. I tried to explain that by being aware of the atrocities in life we can change the world and do things better. That still didn't help. It was a vivid description of the inhumane ways Africans were kept on slaveships. I can't believe this book won an award ! I wish I had read it first before reading it aloud. Beware ! Possibly older children could handle this author's delivery of the subject, but not the young ones !"
3,The Slave Dancer by Scott Bobbitt,"How would you like to be kidnapped by a couple of big black men?Thats what happened to the 13 year old named Jessie in the book called The Slave Dancer by Paula Fox and published by Dell publishing in 1973. Jessie was in the market when two men kidnapped him.They put the boy in a burlap bag and took him onto a small raft.Jessie was horrified.After a few days, they came to their destination.A destination that Jessie had never heard of.It was a ship called The Moonlight. The boat carried blacks that would be sold off as slaves.The boys job was to entertain the slaves.He played music on his fife for them.They were weak from diseases but they tried to dance. Jessie somehow ends up on an island that he thinks is deserted.If you would like to know what happens to him read, The Slave Dancer. I would reccomend this book to someone who is mature because of the language and the situations.A lot of the people are racist in this book and have bad names for African Americans."
4,Review of the Slave Dancer,This book is about a boy named Jessie Bollier. Jessie gets taken against his will on to a slave ship and has to play music to dance the slaves to keep them healthy and fit. On the way back to America right off the coast of Mississippi the slave ship sank. Jessie and two of the slaves got ashore. I don't want to spoil the ending so read the book and find out for your self.This is a good book to read if you are studying about the slave trade in America and how bad it was.
1,This is a Horrible Book,"I don't recommend the book The Slave Dancer for anyone. The first reson why I don't like this book because it has very little action and no humor. Secondly I thought there was way too much detail, it explained about everything. The third reson why I didn't like the book was because nothing really happened. This book is also horrible because it is historical fiction which I think gets really boring. All those reasons conclude to why I don't like the book The Slave Dancer. While I was reading the book the Slave Dancer by Paula Fox, I found out about Jesse's adventure on a slaver. In the beginning Jessie, a young boy, gets captured and gets taken on a small ship called the Moonlight. Jessie was taken on a slaver to make slaves dance. Soon after, Jessie was taken to Africa to get the slaves and then afterwards they would sell them for money. The Slave Dancer explains an expedition on an 1840's slaver."
5,It was touching,I think that the slave dancer was cool because it was about a time were black people were slaves and it showed hoe not everybody was cold hearted.
4,The Slave Dancer,The Slave Dancer is a great but a very boring book. It is a book for HIGH LEVELED READERS only. I think it was a very dramatic story. It's about a white boy who is capurted and sent on a slave ship. His duty was to play his fife for the slaves. He was forced to be aboard the ship from New Orleans to Africa. Jessie has to survive like the slaves and he has to watch all of the torture. He doesn't like it but he has to. To find more intresting things about Jessie and Ras you should read The Slave Dancer. From: Yo Mama
1,80% gimmick 20% substance,"This book boasts it gives you verbs and grammar (as if verbs were not grammar!).Sweeping statements, muddled notes, this sums up what you find when you open the book. I gave it up and bought Prista's grammar. Prista's is an excellent little book that gives you GRAMMAR in general including VERBS, all in a nutshell but clearly explained.No doubt a much better buy!"
1,Disappointed,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I had just received it in the mail this morning and filled the fuel cartridge up. I then tried to light the torch and nothing happened. Then I tried to figure out what was wrong with it and it turns out the ignition spark was not working and then the cartidge did not fit correctly. This was even the cartridge given with the product. DO NOT BUY...
2,"one works, another doesn't","I bought two of these, one to give as a gift. I use it on the beach (where it is too windy for normal lighters) to whip or melt the ends of nylon sailing lines. One worked perfectly using the refillable cartridge (supplied) and also a cheap Chinese made BIC type butane lighter. The other one didn't seem to work with either unless I shimmed the cartridge to raise it up in the torch housing. Must be some loose manufacturing tolerances here."
2,so so,This item doesn't have the best volume control. If you do have the volume increased your voice comes through the ear piece and is very annoying.
5,You will love this wireless headset,"I am on the phone constantly and was so sick of either holding the phone between my shoulder and my ear, or having to use my speakerphone (which drove my co-workers crazy). I finally broke down an paid my own money to buy this wireless headset because one of my co-workers has one and loves it. I must say that it was a bit pricey, but worth every penny. It takes just a little time to get used to exactly how the ""major"" and ""minor"" adjustments work for the hearing and microphone volumes, but by about the 3rd use I had it down. I use the molded earloop (not the headband) because I have really cool spiked hair and I don't want to mess it up. By the way, I am a 55 year old female banker -- so even ""mature"" professionals can:(1)have cool hair, and (2) learn how to use great technology. Anyway, it took me a couple of days to figure out which size earloop was the most comfortable, but now I just can't imagine working without this great product."
1,Personality at Work,"I was disappointed in the book and would not recommend it. The explored ideas are rather superficial, and lacking depth and detail. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I was already familiar with the dynamics of introverted and extroverted personalities at work, beyond that, there was nothing else to absorb. Sorry!"
3,up to you on buying,the plot isnt super strong it makes sense over all not bad to watch it make a ok add on to ya collection.the voice and everything work well just wasnt impressed with the story line it wasnt so strong it flip flops back n forth I think the main charater spends more time going nuts with his teachers that adopted him then he do having a good time but its good I wont be little its not bad having this one a boy go to school his teachers find he is alone decide to give him a famil n move in with him things get pretty interesting after that I am not saying dont buy it but check it u decide for yourself I am not going to say its awesome u buy it then dont like it check it out before buying if you like it cool if not well ya call if u just like watching anime and want to kill time this isnt too bad for that or a rainy day when you got nothing to do
4,Great movie... didn't come as expected,I ordered this expecting it would come with cover and in original DVD case. Shocked when I opened the package and saw it was a black DVD case with only the first of the two Lion King DVD's inside. I guess I should have read the description before I bought it. Plugged the movie in and it worked well... a few scratches here and there. Fast shipping so that was a plus.
2,boring programming for PC viewing,"You know what you are buying when you buy a Disney product. There is no question that you get a top quality cartoon...but the rest is just rude.Lion King is to my opinion the best Disney cartoon there has been made. The plot, the characters and just everything about the cartoon is fascanating. Five stars fort the actual cartoon.How ever, you get an insight in what kind of a ""dinosaur"" Disney has become when you try to play the DVD.First of all; you are forced to watch all the other disney commercials -1star.If you wish to watch it on PC, you are forced to install a special program from Disney -2stars. Just not necessary since the VLC player can play the cartoon perfectly and is not as boring as this Disney player.To summerize; you pay for a top product and get commercials and boring program. Sorry Disney - but I just cannot accept that and give a good review.More artists and less laywers, that is my advice."
1,BOOTLEG!!!,This video was a illegal copy to the original. All of the material inside including the booklets were all photocopied and were very blurry. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
4,Hate lions,"Lions are very boring . Here's what happens. the king and queen lion have this cub named Simba and simba has all these adventures to try to become the future king. He has problems along the way that he must face and tons of friends and songs. This movie was a great cartoon, but it gets boring after you watch it tons of times~"
4,It's The Lion King in 3D...Sort Of,"Since Amazon clumps all the various formats (VHS, DVD, 3D/Blu-ray) into this one review section, I don't want to berate the movie because the Lion King is a 5 star movie.Actually, I would give the 3D/Blu-ray version only 3 stars because the 3D rendition is sub-par. If you own a 3D TV capable of converting 2D to 3D, you will get as good result from the original DVD version as this (3D) movie accomplishes. Granted, the original production of this movie did not anticipate a 3D version making it subject to limitations of 2D to 3D scene layering. I was just not really impressed with the 3D version. I'm just as happy(er) with the original DVD version.Anyway, The Lion King is a really good movie worth owning in any format. I recommend the original DVD movie version or the basic blu-ray version."
4,lion king,I really enjoyed the animation aspect of the movie. Character developement was great and the voices chosen to do them as well. I think Lion King was a big step for the production company as far as the quality of the animation was concerned. The plot of the movie is generaly the same every time. Not that it's a bad thing though since it is a childrens movie.
5,how could they go from this caliber to treasure planet,"By far the greatest disney film ever and the most succuessful animated film of all time. it had it all. great plot , great animation that couldnt be replaced by any computer, excellent character design, the best voice acting for an animated film ever, incredible score, everything that made a film great. what citizen kane did for movies today, the lion king did for the animated universe. they raised the bar three times over for a kids film. somewhere in this time , disney got into thinking too much of themselves and believed everything they did was going to sell like crazy. they lost the magic and they started creating some movies of subpar quality like Atlantis, and treasure planet. i wont stray too far away from the movie im rating. it was this movie that set disney apart from other companies and thier work. i hope they get the magic back into filming and soon."
2,good vendor/bad products,"This vendor was extremely easy to work with and tried to help in every way possible. My original movie did not work in any machine I put it in.With no questions or concerns,they sent me another one without waiting for the first one to be returned. The second one was no good either.After contacting them,I got an immediate refund to my credit card.Although I would give their products a less than one..I would give the vendor a five"
5,Lion King DVD,"This is one of the best Disney movies ever. My grandson watches it every week when he visits, and sometimes over and over. He's gotten now to where he knows many of the words! I bought it for his 4th birthday to keep at our house, and it's provided many, many hours of enjoyment for all of us."
5,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this movie for my 10th birthday. It is really funny and very entertaining! The animation is great and the first scene is stunning. I love this movie. This is the best Disney movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Lion King DVD,I recieved this new dvd in the mail and the corner of the box was damaged. The Dvd inside had been sliding around and there are some signs of scratches. I have not watched the dvd yet to see if has effected it.
5,The last great Disney movie...,"To me, this was the last Disney production that was excellent. The animation is astounding and the plot keeps you watching. Im 15 years old and i still watch it. The music is stirring and the emotions of the movie almost move me to tears every time i see it (you cant help feeling incredibly sad when Mufasa dies). The bottom line is, if you havent seen this movie, no matter what your age, see it. Then see it again and again."
5,Lion King: Best Movie of All Time,"Ever since The Lion King came out in theaters back in June of 1994, it's been a tremendous phenomena. When I first heard the chant of ""Naaaaants Svenya Ma bagi, thi-baba"" (start of Circle of Life), I was hooked. I've seen it 10 times in the theater, and many more on Video Tape. It's still the best selling video of all time! (Yes, it beat that dumb Titanic!) Great animation, great music, and a great cast.. It's just.. great! ;) Ooohra TLK! END"
5,Classic,love this classic movie. my kids like it too. great movie for entire family. will be around for many years to come.
2,Not what was expected,"I expected the DVD to carry the original Lion King movie/story. Instead, it is a modified story book edition with little if any animation, although the cartoons are all faithful to the originals. However, it really fails in achieving anywhere near the entertainment value, emotion and wonder of the movie or theatre performance. All in all - a big letdown. The only saving grace was that the price fell dramatically by shipment time and there are a couple of neat little inter-active games that keep young children interested for about 15 to 20 minutes. My suggestion - save your money; wait and see if they ever release the actual movie on DVD."
1,Ready4Christmas,"The product was shipped and recieved before the promised date which was a great suprise. However, when I opened the package, the dvd isn't in the original casing (very disapointing) I read the product details before and after ordering and receiving the movie and nowhere did it say it wasn't going to be sent with the actual Lion King case."
3,G-rated with this much violence?,"Am I the only parent who's troubled by how incredibly violent this movie is? The majority of the scenes were fights and struggles, or fear-creating. Obviously it's a good vs. evil movie, but rating it G when there's so much violence (Scar hitting Simba's mother and knocking her out, constant violent fights between lions and hyaenas, etc.) seems ridiculous to me. I had never seen it until I just rented it for my 3-year old daughter, and I'm horrified that it's rated G. It should be PG--the subject matter is too old for a G audience. I can only imagine how many times the word ""kill"" was uttered in this movie. G should mean that any kid who is mature enough to sit through a movie should be able to watch it, but obviously that's not the case--it's G simply because it's animated? Ridiculous.And what, tell me, is Disney's fascination with killing off parents before their time?"
5,Perfect,"What arrived in my mailbox was exactly what I had ordered. The Lion King has been one of my favorite movies since I was a child, and I'm glad I could purchase this item so easily. :) There is an added song... ""Morning Report,"" which I'm not fond of, but which I expected to be in the movie. Since it's the special platinum edition, it has a huge amount of special features, which I enjoyed. Great buy."
5,my favorite movie of all time,"I bought this movie 5 years ago from Blockbuster. I saw The Lion King at school and this movie has everything. Emotion, comedy, horror, etc. The characters were great. My favorite is Timon. You may hear people say this movie is for little kids, (NOT TRUE). This is a movie for everyone. It's nice if you have a family with kids or even teens to sit down and pop this movie in. This movie is a little graphic in the scene were Mufasa gets killed. But shortly after Timon and Pumba will rebound the happy nature of the movie. I highly recommend this movie when is comes out of the Vault."
2,Lion King DVD,"The end of the movie was defective, but my little grandchildren who were visiting wanted to take it home anyway, because except for the last five minutes the movie was fine and they loved it. I also got a free movie which they loved and was in good condition."
1,Dvd does not play past 30 minutes!,Very dissatisfied! The DVD plays until about 30 minutes then it freezes up. There is no way to skip the stratch. Totally worthless!!
1,Scary and regressive,"I may be the only person on the planet with this opinion, but I did not like the message of this movie. The story is paternalistic in the extreme, displaying an overt and highly conservative agenda. I couldn't believe it. The Lions are a dictatorship supported by the animals in the jungle with a Nazi-ish zeal. A male child is born and seen as a savior? Where's the mom in all this? Where are the females at all except to giggle and bat their eyes, and to create male heirs?"
4,Suprised at how good the 3D was!,"I purchased this at a brick and mortar store but felt that I should post a quick impression of the 3D bluray disc for you. Surprisingly the 3D conversion of the movie was quite good. Usually in the 3D conversions you get just so so 3D effects because the conversion wasn't done with much care. The guys who did the 3D conversion on the Lion King at Disney did a great job adding depth and 3D effects to the movie. Foreground and backgrounds were done perfectly to where it added to the story instead of detracting from it visually. Characters ""pop"" at the right moments and there were not any 3D effects that made the movie worse. Overall I am very pleased with this and will be picking up the other Disney 3D blurays as they come out."
5,Nostalgia,"This is such a great movie, being a child when it first premiered I immediately fell in love and that love never faded. I was thrilled when I heard it was coming out on DVD."
4,3D not so great,"This is. a great movie, but unfortunately the 3D just didn't transfer as well. Despite our best efforts to fix the quality, it was blurry and unfocused, not so bad that we couldn't watch it but still unpleasant."
5,Best Disney Movie,I have always loved this movie as a kid but it was tremendously hard to find on DVD without paying a fortune. Thank goodness for the internet.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product because of the 100% satisfaction rating of other customers. However, we got a defective DVD and I have written to this vender 2 times and have not received an answer or anything. I'm highly discouraged! I have written to Amazon for a refund through their A-Z guarantee"
5,Classic,"I bought this video when I couldn't find it for rent in my local video store for my daughter to watch. Glad I did! I forgot how much I enjoyed this Disney classic, which is obviously ""in the vault"". Now we can look at it whenever we like."
3,Good but Unoriginal,"A good movie, but unfortunatly a lot was ripped off of Kimba, The White Lion. Coming out in the 60's, this series had an evil uncle with an injured eye and hyena followers, a bird and baboon that were similar to The Lion King's characters, girlfriend of Kimba, similar plots and and even the rock that appears at the beginning of The Lion King. To see the original series by Tezuki that The Lion King was based on (even if Disney won't admit it) check it out starting with the first volume ""Kimba the White Lion - The King is Dead, All Hail the King"""
5,Terrific,Quite simply the best animated movie of all time. I was young when it was made and as an adult now I still enjoy it very much. It is a great family film and something that all kids would enjoy. I know I've passed it on to my nieces nd nephews and one day my children. A great movie...Disney at its best!
1,"No digital copy, no sale.","Who doesn't love this movie? Despite it not matching the 1995 original because of new edits and sequences, it's still an awesome movie. That said, WHY IS THERE NO DIGITAL COPY INCLUDED? Not everyone watches 100% of their media at home on the TV. Therefore, I'll download it instead."
1,didnt work...,"I gave my 3 yr old cousin this DVD for christmas of 2009, the DVD DID NOT WORK at all... i had my other cousin (his mom) test it in both DVD players in the house and it didnt work on either one... i know its a little late to post this but i didnt know I could do it until now."
4,Great,The movie is great!! I have been trying to find one for a few months now. My husband has been wanting this movie for a while. Great condition and VERY quick delivery!! Thanks!!!
5,A wonderful journey through the circle of life,"The Lion King has been my absolute favorite movie ever since it ""pounced"" it's way into theaters. The story of Simba is a complicated one, with tragedy and facing one's responsibility being the key moral issues dealt with. The story, animation, score, and characters are top notch. This is probably one of Disney's most original works, and is a masterpiece on all fronts. Whether you are a fan of lions in general (which just so happen to be my favorite critters.) doesn't matter.The Lion King is a masterpiece, and well deserving of the royal treatment Disney has bestowed on it for it's inaugural DVD release."
5,The king of all Dvd's,"Stunning!The gratest dvd of all time, the 9 exclusive character portraits are beautiful.The Dvd companion book is simply great, pictures, drawings, a bit of history, all is written down here.The Dvd is amzing.I really enjoyed watching with my parents the Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari.I can't wait to be watching The Lion King again..."
2,Lion King,this video skips when i play it so thats not good. But it does have a pretty cover to it. I would not recommend anyone to buy video from here if is going to be like this i cant even watch it because it skips that much.
5,I love this movie! I love this DVD set!,"This is possibly one of the greatest DVDs I have ever purchased. Amazing movie and numerous bonus features. I would recommend this product to anyone without the slightest hesitation. Just make sure you buy it from a trusted seller. My initial attempt at purchasing this item resulted in myself recieving a counterfeit copy. It looked fairly convincing, but I read the small print on the inner part of the disc and it read ""Dinsey"" instead of Disney. Either way, I tried again and got the real deal, although it was a Canadian copy."
4,Anatomy Lab Book,"I'm taking an Anatomy class & this book is so much better than the one recommended to us by the college. If you don't have alot of time to spend studying in the lab, this book is the next best thing!"
3,Many errors and poor research,"As a native southern Californian, I caught many technical/research errors in Glatt's book that I found distracting. For example, he wrote that Claremont lies 30 miles WEST of L.A., which would put you into the Pacific Ocean (he should have said EAST). Plus, he continously spelled people's names incorrectly, got the name of Kristin's middle school wrong (""Claremont Junior High School"" does not exist in California), and there are just too many other errors to list here. I don't know if it was the fault of the author or his editor, but still, it left the reader wondering if this author could be believed at all. I recommend Caitlin Rother's book about Kristin Rossum because it was much more accurate and well researched. Glatt tried to make his book ""sexy"" by focusing on the salacious elements of the story, while Rother presented a much more objective and factual account."
4,Well done!,The show is very well done! It stays on the path and doesn't seem to stray into conspiracy's or rumors. Great series to show in schools!
1,Product does not work with Ruger SP101 22LR revolver,"The product is meant for 22 long rifle revolvers, and the description includes ""Ruger SP101"". I ordered this speedloader, and when I received it noticed it only held 6 rounds. The Ruger SP101 22 model holds *8* rounds, so it isn't compatible. Based on the different HKS models listed on the speedloader packaging, it doesn't appear as if HKS makes one for the 22LR version of Ruger's SP101. I hope others find this review helpful."
2,Not What I Expected,"While the author covers just about every tip imaginable; the book seemed like more of an appetizer than anything. The author gives brief descriptions but does not really go into much depth. I was looking for more detail and just did not quite feel like I got it from this book. It was more of a teaser. I may have pulled one or two ideas from the book overall, but there was really no sizzle for me."
4,Save you seals,"Weather or not these really work I can't tell you for sure. It is controversial to say the least.One side says they wear your fork tube out from trapping dirt.The other side says they work an make seals last a long time.Either way you should roll or flip them up occasionally and clean out any dirt that gets trapped between the seal saver and the fork tube.Also, the long ones are not intended to run all the way down your inner fork tube (the part that moves) and will get bunched up when it compresses if you do run them that way. They are intended to run the same length down the part of the fork tube the moves, maybe an inch or two but run further up the housing then the short ones and protect the aluminum outer tube from dents due to roost.Gary"
1,Lousy Movie,"The Coen brothers are great, but this is a lousy movie, there are some original parts, but a lot of the humor doesn't work. Jennifer Jason Leigh uses the most grating voice imaginable."
1,Boring beyond belief,"This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I wish I could give the movie a rating of zero stars, but that isn't an option. I just got through watching ""The Sword of the Valiant"", it was so bad it made me smile. ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" is so bad it made me groan. I couldn't wait for it to end. It was pure torture, I expected a lot better from Tim Robbins, Paul Newman, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. I would just burn the DVD, but maybe I can find someone who will be as taken by this movie as all the other people who gave it glowing reviews, maybe one of them would be willing to give me the $15 I paid for this turkey."
3,Fifty Percent of a Five Star Movie,"I'm very fond of this movie. That's because Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Newman, and all the rest of the cast are just about perfect. Robbins is perfect as a ""capraesque"" hero in the mold of Jimmy Stewart and Jennifer Jason Leigh does a great job playing a role Katherine Hepburn probably would have had if the movie had really been made back in Hollywood's golden age.The problem with the movie is that when it plays it straight, the way Capra did with films like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" it's absolute magic. The scenes with Robbins and Leigh are wonderful.But when the movie slips into an attempt to parody films like those, that's when it stumbles and starts looking surreal and grotesque.But in the end more of the movie works than that which doesn't...so I'd definitely recommend seeing it."
5,wow,this is a great film.simple story great acting wonderful score paul newman is great a truley good time.
3,Watch Out for the Fresh Tomato Tart Recipe!,"Great book obviously if you like olives, capers and anchovies. A word of advice: watch the directions on the Fresh Tomato Tart - one whole cup of heavy cream plus one whole cup of half & half equals TWO CUPS of liquid going into your 9-inch tart pan, which will then escape through the cracks of your pan and make a giant mess. I started over, and used something less than one cup of liquid - I mean you're only using three eggs, so I should have seen this coming.The tapenade is delicious."
1,A card would be better,"I was a bit embarrassed when I visited my sick friend (65 yrs old) and saw this product I'd shipped. It was a bunch of junk, basically. I should have read the contents more closely -- a nice plant would have been better and probably cheaper."
5,This album really shows Lynch's skills,BUY THIS ALBUM. ITS BEATS AND BASS LINE ARE OFF THE HOOK AND LYNCH COMES WITH THAT REAL NORTHERN CALI SICCNESS FLOW.
5,How can I order this CD?,Why must I go thru these changes inorder to buy this CD? Just let me give you a credit card number so I can purchase the CD.
3,Big Step Down From Season,"I really do think that this album can almost in no way be compared to how good Season Of The Siccness is. Some of the beats are off tempo when Lynch is rapping on it, and most of them I really just can't listen to at all because the beat is wack. The first four songs are basically nothing and if someone is rapping on it then you have to wait a couple minutes or so for it to start. The only songs worth mentioning are Thats What I Said, Did It and Did It, and On My Briefcase. Not enough songs to go out and buy the album. Go get Season of The Siccness instead."
2,"Brotha Lynch Good, Loaded Bad","Ok, Brotha Lynch Hung has amazing talent and really can rap. But this CD has nothing. Im not hatin on Brotha Lynch, but he just didnt do ne thing with this cd. If you wanna go buy a cd, go get Biggy or Scarface, Or acually any other Brotha Lynch CD, but stay away from this one. It does have 1 good song, its called ""1 mo pound"" thatz the real brotha lynch."
4,this cd contains many powerful messages throughout the album,"Brotha Lynch Hung's second cd is everything you would expect and more. Even though it does not contain as much violent imagery, his explanations of situations that occur in the ghetto is more than enough to tide you over. Track 3 "" Die one by one "" is vintage Lynch Hung. It's filled with the gory descriptions of murder and even has traces of his meat obsession that set his cd apart from the rest. Rappers such as E-40 and Ice t are sprinkled throughout the album. One rapper stands out from the rest when you listen through the cd. He goes by the name of Sicx and is found in tracks 10 & 14. His fast-paced delivery and razor sharp adjectives are sure to make you rewind a few verses. This album has all the weapons to battle other more famous west coast rappers like Tupac Ice Cube and Mack 10."
5,Excellent,"I borrowed this book from a friend's mother and had it finished in less than an hour. It was so interesting I couldn't put it down. The book didn't even have to leave their house. Such a great read. I only wish that those people who believe all goths are suicidal Satanists would read it. Even though I don't go for the whole labling people thing, I must say that this was enlightening and not at all what I thought it would be when it was insisted I read it."
4,The goth bible,The goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly InclinedI thought it was a really good book. She (Nancy Kilpatrick) really went out of her way to find answers and really wanted to know what goth people thought about the scene. The only thing that I disliked was the layout of the book. For example you're reading the section of fashion and then to the sides it has people opinions. But other than that I wish it were bigger.She should come out with a second book since some things have died down and others are just emerging. Beautiful photos as well although they are in black and white.Really recommend this book to a goth or someone wanting to know about it.
4,okay,"informative guide helpful in areas not helpful with dealings with other people the product arrived 2 months earlier than expected, and was in perfect condition."
1,ugh,"""Unfortunately, I haven't read the book, but this page seems to be a breeding ground for posers.""-SO true.if your a neo-goth poser that shops at hot topic then this is perfect for you."
4,Dog the Bounty Hunter DVD,"I do have one suggestion to improve the viewing of this series and that would be to reformat the viewing option of having to ""babysit"" the remote in order to progress to the next segment. The DVD should run through the entire DVD without having to manually advance to the next episode."
3,Christmas Dog,I thought the product was a good price and was sent in the mail at a very speedy rate. The only problem now is that part of the DVD's skip and I'm not sure what to do. I am not sure if you exchange products or not. My son really wanted these series for Christmas and now on the 2nd DVD he has opened it skips. He's afraid to unwrap the other two. And the 1st one is open and fine. Please help if you can. If there is anything you can do it would be much appreciated. It's been the first time i have ordered from Amazon and was very pleased. Again just need help with the video. Thank You so much!
1,"Why is this considered ""great""?","As a life-long reader of almost all types of fiction and non-fiction (no horror please) I am disappointed with this ""high rated"" book.So far I am on page 60 and find it very hard going. I have not found any of this interesting. Maybe it could be because I grew up in the ""Bible Belt"" and later lived in that area for awhile as an adult. I've met people that lived such lives as this book, so have no desire to continue reading about them.Since this book is for one of two book discussion groups that I participate in, I shall finish reading the book, but I shall have to really push myself. It has no appeal at all.As the ole saying ""So many books, so little time"", there are dozens of books waiting that I want to read and should be enjoyable. At this stage of my life (I'm 65+) I like realism, thrillers, escapism and novels that end where people have grown and are doing well in their lives."
4,a sad story :(,"A Complicated Kindness is a very well written book that I found to be very, very enjoyable.Some parts were kind of slow but overall it was an interesting and unique story. I felt horrible for the way Nomi's life was going and I understand why she'd want to leave that town of hers like her mother and sister did. This girl is NOT happy and it makes the reader soo sad :( You'll find yourself cheering for her and wanting her to get out of that town and just run and never stop.You are going to despise her uncle, so be prepared to hate one of Miriam Toews characters with passion.You DON'T want to miss this book so go check it out.-tvandbookaddict.blogspot.com"
2,An Empty Story,"Miriam Toews knows how to write, that's for sure and her lack of puctuation didn't bother me one bit - it added to the narrative. What I found unsatisfactory about this book, though, was its lack of anything positive or hopeful. After a friend pointed out to me that Ms. Toew's own father was mentally ill and had committed suicide, things started to make sense. This book appears to be about Ms. Toews own struggle with depression and her lack of any kind of resolution to the problems that have plagued her and her family. I think we were given a glimpse into her own unfinished personal analysis, an analysis that has not reached any positive conclusions or coping skills to survive in the world. If writing this book was cathartic, then I hope the next will be based on the cumlination of all this self examination and be life affirming in some way. Don't read this unless you just want a glimpse into a troubled childhood with little hope for the future and no answers."
2,Complicated Kindness...I think I missed something.,"The concept of this book was a good one. Unfortunately, I could only get half way through this book because of the lack of punctuation. If you can tolerate reading a book without much punctuation, you will most likely enjoy it. If you are a stickler about proper punctuation, read something else."
3,Kind of a let down,"I read this book because my boyfriend mentioned it to me. The premise sounded interesting. Some of the book really was interesting, but some of it was just mundane and very gloomy. I really felt like the character was getting nowhere fast, like Nomi was not going to make any progression at all as a young adult even after the book ended. I did not like the ending.Not to mention that some on the writing style was hard to follow. Maybe it's just me, but there were times I didn't realize someone was speaking until she up and mentioned it later in the sentence. I found that to be an irritant throughout that entire book.All in all a difficult read, and not something someone should read while in a either really good or really bad mood in my opinion, lol. This book will leave an emotional effect."
3,Understanding the Old Testament,Disappointed. A book I had heard much about in other works. Seemed more like an introduction to the Biblical criticism approach to the study of the O T. I am for a rounded education at the graduate level that includes study of this approach. But as a text for Old Testament Introduction in seminary this seemed unsuited. This comes decades after my own M Div. and an M. A. (state university).
3,"""Unlady Like"" by Mia X","Mia X, off No Limit Records, made her debut in 1994 with her album ""Good Girl Gone Bad."" She followed it up with her sophomore album, entitled ""Unlady Like,"" which has a more broad appeal. She still is true to her Southern roots but includes a commercially successful song called ""Party Don't Stop"" which features Master P and Foxy Brown. This song is easily debated as the hottest track on the lp. Being the only female in the No Limit group, she has a lot to live up to. Where other weak females fail(Yo-Yo, Roxanne Shante, Lady of Rage) Mia X delivers. Personally, I would recommend picking up the single, but if you're a true No Limit fan, cop the album too. For an informative and truthful review, look for the signature name atop other rap, hip-hop and R&B titles at Amazon.com. ~Peace."
4,I LIKE YOUR STYLE OF RAP,YOUR STYLE OF RAP IS DEEP AND HAS A DEEP ATTITUDE THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER BITCHY BUT I FIND IT TO BE STRONG IN A PLACE WHERE FEW FEMALE RAPPERS GET THEIR PROPS.
3,Short,"Each section of the video is VERY short. The warm-ups are twice as long as the actual workout and you go for under 20 minutes for each section. If you tell the main menu to play all then you have to wait through credits to get to the next one just to get a decent length of time in your workout - just using the chapters was easier, link all the 'workout' sections together and do those, then do one of the cool downs at the end.I'm not sure why this is called yoga dance. There are yoga ideals - such as the connection to the earth and the rooting of the heels, and the mountain pose, but really this was more ike a modern dance with mind fusion - not yoga dance.It was a fun DVD, but it probably won't find its way into any normal rotation of my exercise; it will just be something I pull out when I need a little extra oomph on top of a normal routine."
4,I think it is pretty good.,I think that it was a good cd for him but it sounds like every other (No Limit) rapper. I just thought it would be a different approach. Besides that I liked it.
1,Sonic Hi-Colonic,"Kremerbund Zokloppi, who currently goes under the silly name of ""Mr. Serv-On"", originally released this sophomore effort 9 years ago under the title ""Tickle Me Elmo Romp"" (he was then trying to cash in on a 1994 children's fad). It seems mighty inappropriate to ""serv"" it up unretouched in 2003, trying to pass it off as a supposedly hard-core rap album. What true ghetto boy could respond thuggishly to lyrics like ""Happy you, happy me, tickling each other on the bum, underneath the poopy tree""? Honestly!"
4,One of the Greatest No Limit CDs,"This album is really tight. Before No Limit blew up they used to put out a lot of great stuff. Once they got popular, they turned WACK. The best track is It's Real with Master P and Brotha Lynch Hung. This is a great album for ALL rap heads, not just southern crunk fans."
3,"Not quite as good as other NL titles, but still alright.",Mr.Serv-On's first album was pretty good. It has some great songs such as head and shoulders. This wasn't one of No Limit's better CD's though. It wasn't as good as many other albums on the label.
5,Excellent value,"I've used the Neiko tach for a little over a month in my workshop. In the past I've done machine speed calculations using motor speed and pulley sizes wherever that was possible (drill press, lathe, etc) Where calculation isn't possible, the tach is a great help. I've used it routinely on variable speed machines (hand held and table mounted routers) and have been extremely satisfied. I've found that a small dab of white paint on the collet or spindle is an easy substitute for using the supplied reflective tape. Now I don't have to guess at bit speeds in the router which can be a serious safety issue using larger diameter bits."
1,Didn't work on lathe or milling machine,"Delivery was prompt and Amazon fullfillment made a return easy, but the unit did not work as received. I am pretty familiar with these types of devices but readings were eratic with swings of multiple hundreds of RPM's, an approximate 30% varying error. I tried painting a large flat black backdrop before placing the reflective tape and it made no difference."
3,Welcome to Shuffling Hell.,"These are cute, and thick, totally sturdy to put up with the abuse from this age of kids. However, their shape makes them impossible to shuffle. You know how if you are shuffling regular rectangular playing cards and one of them has the smallest tear in the side, it's hard to smush them together and straighten them out after shuffling? These would be just as cute and more fun to play with if they were rectangular.Also, they lose a star in the educational value section because the color of the character on the card does not match the color of the card. For example, the GREEN card has a RED Bertie the bus. It's not that big a deal, and my kids (4 yrs and almost 3 yrs) didn't have trouble getting confused as we played Go Fish (by colors), but last year we got some Lightning McQueen cards with this same problem (a green 4 with 1 red McQueen car on it), and it totally confused them.The package is thick plastic, so very durable too."
2,Wireless Hacks is better,"This book is neither for the end user, nor is it for the power user. For the end user the Windows side is covered well enough, but probably not at the level you would want. For the Mac end-user the coverage is only about OS 9, which is crazy for a book published in 2003. For the power user you will want Wireless Hacks from O'Reilly, which has much more in-depth coverage of the hacky side of wireless; packet scanning, hacking hardware, making your own antenna, shotgun wireless."
4,Works Great!,This is actually a repeat purchase of the same product. It works great and I would recommend it. I plan to buy more if/when the need arises.
4,Untrasonic Pest control,I put one is each of my rooms and as yet have seen no more bugs in the house.
1,"Sorry, it does not work","Spiders are not bothered by these things, in fact one made a web right next to the repeller. I have checked the lights on them and they were all on, so the devices should have been working. There is absolutely no effect on spiders or bugs. I get small spiders and very rarely an occasional small bug, and even these tiny things were not affected."
2,Not sure it worked,"This item really did not do anything. it doesn't disturb the gecko, though. But it makes such an annoying clicking noise, that I had to permanently unplug it, after not seeing any results for three weeks"
1,No Star - not even one star.,"I started using this product the week of August 17, 2011, and it's still plugged into my wall outlet. But the item is not functioning. There are still roaches in my kitchen area, which only appear during the night.There appears to be the same number of roaches, no less and no more.I ordered this product because it featured 3 instead of one. But none of them have worked properly.I would NOT recommend you buy this product, mines appear to be defective. I contacted the seller in hopes of replacing them, in the end I would like to get a refund."
1,Doesn't seem to work at all,"First off, I can hear the whine these things make. It was annoying at first but now I am used to it. Secondly, I have had THREE of them in my 400sq ft master bedroom/bathroom and the rat I was trying to chase away just laughs at them. Also, we sometimes get bugs in the summer because we live in the woods and today I noticed a small roach actually sitting on one of the plug ins. $20 waste of money."
2,Ghettos Tryin to kill me,This is there early days from 1994 when they were a Gangsta group back then they were better rappers.This again like earlyMaster P albums is in terrible quality but the rapping is goodAs I said if your in it for there style you will like it.Lyrics 8/10 Production 2/10 X Factor 2/10 Style 9/10 Voice 10/10Music 2/10 Innovative 3/10 Classic 3/10 Guest 4/10 Blends 3/10Overall=44 wich is about enough for a 2 Mic affair.Buy this if your into buying everything are into Master P arevery loud and awesome style rapping wich is good on here
1,Wish I could share an opinion,"Sadly, the item is out of stock. Having been so advised by email a few days ago, I figured I'd come back and look again. Guess what? It's still advertised for sale.Don't know about the product, but I wouldn't rate the seller very high."
4,Before MTV,"Many may be surprised to discover that before Master P became Mr. MTV, he was actually good. This album started it all."
3,Worth watching,"Yeah, every gay man--at least once--wants a straight man whowon't give gay sex a try. My favorite line: ""Straight menshould go gay, and women should go into politics. It would save theplanet."" This is a funny, lighthearted movie. It's good if youjust want some nice entertainment."
2,Poor explanations,"I used this book in a graduate school course. I found myself checking out other mathematical physiology books to understand what they were talking about. There's poor explanations, and they skip certain steps that would help the reader get a better understanding of what's going on. Save your money and skip this book."
2,Not What I Expected,"I have to say, I was a bit dissapointed when I got this book. The book consists of the characteristics of sharks IN GENERAL. Unfortunately, not all sharks are the same, so a lot is left out. The pictures are at best average, and are mainly of sharks that you could see at Ripley's aquarium. This book DOES NOT describe the different kinds of sharks. It is a basic, vague overview of sharks. If you would like a book that describes the different kinds of sharks and has better pictures, I suggest a book called ""Sharks"". It is also published by Firefly books and is probably more of what you are looking for."
5,Great for teachers,This is an excellent book for teachers of 4th grade - adult. Contains fun and challenging language activities that can be modified for all levels!
5,Great fun-- the start of an unclassifiable series....,"The Mongo books defy any attempt at classification, and that's what makes them so entertaining, as well as the engaging writing by Chesbro. They're thriller/comedy/occult/philosophical exercises that work very well (though the last two entries in the Mongo series are a bit less sterling-- sometimes even dogmatic). Read this and the next four or five in the series (as well as the Chant and Veil books)-- it ain't Shakespeare, but it's entertainment of a high order."
3,"Good product ,poor quality controol at DC level.",Product was damaged when it arrived. I believe it may have been damaged by heat at some point as it was off center and slightly missing a peoce at the crown.
4,Can be messy,"These strips are pretty much what they would use on you in the salon. They do the job, but sometimes they can be a little messy. I always cut mine into smaller pieces when waxing my face. Sometimes after cutting them, little pieces fray off. All over, this product is pretty good."
3,Great new music from Alana Davis,"I bought the album after hearing Alana Davis' version of ""Can't Find My Way Home"" on the radio. After comparing the two versions of the song (Davis' and the original from Blind Faith), I find that the older version is lacking. Davis brings a very smart 90's angle to the song that adds a tremendous amount of depth. The rest of the album is pretty good too... I liked the Bjork contribution especially. Both of these emerging female artists are really finding their voices."
2,Corelle burner covers,"I wish Corelle had made improved the quality of these burner covers, as with daily usage, their paint tends to peel of making them look rusted and ugly...They however do the job of protecting the burners from collecting the spill overs and that's the only reason I kept buying them.....And yah, the designs are good and make the stove look neat(until they're rusted!)Thesedays, I am covering them up with aluminium foil and remove it only when needed, thus ensuring that the paint lasts longer......Either they should be available much cheaper or their quality should improve!!"
5,Cool movie,"I was so worth getting this movie, I'm very glad I did, I enjoyed from begining to end and it is very funny."
1,Beware - made in China,"Beware that this is made in China, not in Germany as the price and description would lead you to believe."
4,Spunky and sassy novel,"In the Paint is about a Detroit woman named Danni Blair whose professional career and romantic relationship are in transition. Danni learns lessons through the people and circumstances of her life which makes for a thoughtful and unique read. Both clever and funny, the novel is written with pizzazz and has an identifiable and likeable voice.This book is for those who love throwback novels; it's traditional in some ways yet sassy and contemporary in others. The dialogue has attitude to spare which makes for a fun read. Lots of scenes are open to individual interpretation and it's just an all-around satisfying read."
5,Thank you to all,"Being the author of this book, I cannot say anything bad about it. It took almost 10 years to write it. I also assume that is currently out-of-print. It is nice to know that everybody is profiting from this book except me. Your comments for a better-improved version are greatly appreciated."
4,Dabangg,I liked the dancing and the music. I was expecting more from the movie review and preview. The music was good.
1,impossible to adjust,I just got them in time for my son's swimming lesson. Good thing I had a different pair. The strap was impossible to adjust and the strap snapped almost right away. No good if they can't be adjusted
1,bad review,I can not open the software. I wants a serial number. I have no idea who to call; Corel or Amazon.
1,Not For Golfers,I had to pull the plug on this one after about 45 minutes. This was all about conversation and did not reflect any golfing realism. The actors stopped for 10 minute conversations between every shot and anyone who plays golf knows that unless you own a private course this does not work. A round of golf would take this group twelve hours to complete. I just could not deal with it.
3,Format Is Difficult,There are some good recipes in this book but as a cookbook I really do not need all the Mitford narrative and contrived attribution to characters in the book. I have found it difficult to find certain things and have trouble re-finding something I wanted.
5,jan karon Milton Cookbook,Love this Cookbook! The purchase was so simple and we received the Book in great condition. Even with a personal note included in the book. Thanking us for our purchase! A very nice experience! We will order again!
2,questionable,"My 10 year old still liked it, but had difficulty wearing the glasses. He did not make it around the neighborhood with the glasses on (which was most of the outfit- the rest was just black thin fabric.) Don't think this outfit was worth the money. Would not buy again."
5,An invitation to live,"This book is simply an invitatin to go out and live life as it was ment to be. Eldredge did use a lot of the same stuff from Wild at Heart again in this book, but the repetition of those points were fairly brief, and they are things that are beneficial to be reminded of once in a while. The great thing about this book as that it is so short that if you ever simply need a little encouragement you can just pick it back up and read it again. Its invitation to live life to the fullest is too important to let yourself forget. I loved it and have read it a few times."
1,Dandruff Shampoo,This product is no better than anything else I've used and it smells bad to boot! The price is no bargain either.
2,Scary Senario,"I have read many y2k books but his this book is by far the most depressing book around.The author states silliness like we might not have power for years and that if y2k does not happen then a depression will happen in 1999. Nothing so far! Then for y2k he gives dates like Jan 1 1999, July 1, 1999, Sept 9,1999 Oct 1,1999 that computers will fail and well nothing happened on these dates! This book if you read it paints the worse case senario. It makes you want to jump since it gives no hope. Good book to make a diaster end of the world movie. This book should not be read by people who want to commit sucide!!!!!!"
5,One of the best...,"I have been reading some reviews saying that this anime is junk. I completely disagree. This is probably one of my favorite animes of all time.Story: Very compelling, interesting, and thought-provoking. 5/5Voice Acting: Pretty good for anime. Sometimes they went a little too far with Yuji's screaming, but oh well... 4/5Action: Top notch. Blood everywhere, and many, many bullets. 5/5I highly recommend this."
3,Just average,"This anime is nothing special. After watching great series like Cowboy Bebop, Full Metal Panic, and Ghost in the Shell, this series cannot hold interest as well as those series could. I did watch the whole series, and while it's not awful, there are better animes to spend your money on.The series is essentially mechs fighting against huge insectoids on an uninhabitable earth. The main character, as someone else said, is kind of annoying, and none of the characters are really memorable."
1,Most boring idiotic pointless anime I've ever watched,"Nothing happens. Nothing! You watch for...what 5 to 6 hours to discover the rediculus ""blue"" is just here to wipe out the earthlings because of overpopulation. Big Deal!Anyone who gives this thing a more than two don't know what story telling is all about. Soon as I can I'm getting rid of this crap. You don't want to be bored silly by a pointless story that goes nowhere don't get this thing."
4,It was bound to happen...,"Yuji Kaido, along with several other everyday men and women, falls victim to a mysterious genetic disorder. With no cure in sight, Yuji and the others are put into a hybernative state for two years. At least, that's what was supposed to happen.Yuji is jarred awake far later than anticipated, and finds himself in a never-ending nightmare where an insect race known as the Blue have overrun the Earth. The government's military units, primarily operating from space stations in the planet's orbit, attempt to eliminate the Blue and reclaim their planet.That, however, is the tip of the iceberg for this series. Throughout the 26 factors (read: episodes) personality traits and conflicts are revealed, relationships teeter on the edge, souls are lost and saved and theories run amuck as it may not be as simple as the Blue taking over the Earth, but that the Earth itself may have developed the Blue to evict the humans.I give Blue Gender the series the highest rating possible."
3,Identity Crisis; coming of age,"I read this book several years ago and I no longer own it. I do remember that the girl's mother was a divorced tomboy who never grew out of it; she lifts weights and does other masculine things. Marleen is a freak and the little old ladies in her neighborhood are always gossiping and they don't like her. I wasn't a big fan of the book at the time, but I think that I would like to read it again now. I'm 15 and I could probably understand it better. Oh, and there's something about an older guy and his car."
4,Let's Learn Portuguese Picture Dictionary,"I purchased this book, and found it helpful for exactly the purpose I intended: to pick up more vocabulary. It is a good way to associate the words with the items, not having to necessarily use English as a crutch. If you must see the English, it's there, but as a teacher of foreign languages, I find it much better to associate the new word with the item bypassing any translation. If you are new or fairly new to Portuguese, and you want some common words, this is your book."
2,A Major Disappointment,"The best part of the book is the forward written by Walter Cronkite - in itself is of important to journalism and our first amendment rights.If you're going to by this book for the two audio CDs in order to ""Relive the Events That Stopped Our Lives. . .,"" don't. The audio CDs are mostly a narrative, read a bit over dramatically by Bill Kurtis. The actual news broadcasts and historical audio has been edited down to modern-day 30-second sound bites, as if we're too dumb to listen to anything longer. It would have been far better to provide *at least* five minutes of uninterrupted audio so we could experience some of the tension and awe of the first moon landing, the assassination of a president or the launch of an invasion. I can hear Bill Kurtis just about any day of the week on TV. We are of an age where technology can help us re-present history in significant chunks. Too bad this book and audio CDs don't do so."
3,Good Idea but Missed an Opportunity,"I liked this book well enough as a ""list"" of the century's events as characterized by their urgent news bulletins. But I agree that there is too much narration and not enough original audio on the CD; the author apparently intended for the CD to be able to stand alone (it doesn't). I was also quite surprised by the number of mistakes (spelling, grammar, punctuation, clumsy wording leading to general inaccuracy) in the book that could have been tidied up with better editing."
3,It's OK...but you can do almost as well for free.,"I say free, because there are a number of sites on the internet that offer Real Audio or other sound format clips of a fair number of the segments presented here. Also, It's also very irritating to listen to Bill Kurtis basically read what's in the book for a minute or two before you finally hear the original broadcast for 30-45 seconds. That happens on a number of the clips. There are sites that make available the entire 6+ minute Hindenburgh crash broadcast available uninterrupted, as opposed to the 2 minute clip job presented here.I applaud the idea, but the execution is somewhat less than perfect. I found the follow-up title ""And The Crowd Goes Wild..."" much better as Bob Costas does far less talking on most clips, leaving more time for the original broadcasts."
5,An all time favorite,"This album is one of my all time fav's. At first it was only on cassette and I wore out 3 different ones and now I'm ordering my second CD! It is so worshipful, providing words of worship when I had none myself. I cannot say enough good things about it."
4,Worth the Money,"The price is high, but this cartridge provides very good quality. I won't risk messing up my high priced printer by using cheaper reconditioned cartridges."
5,Delivered new product promptly as expected.,The title says it all. The product came promptly and in a new sealed box as I expected. I would recommend doing business with this supplier to anyone.
1,Defective,"I would have thought that buying a genuine HP product would have been better than buying a copy, but this cartridge was defective. I thought my trouble was using cheap paper, and didn't recognize the cartridge leakage until too late to return it."
5,HP LaserJet 4L and toner,"I have owned this printer since it was built, and I have replaced toner cartridges about once every year and a half, and maybe longer than that. I could not be more pleased with the printer or the toner. My printouts are clear, sharp, and smudge-free. I have never had a problem with the printer or needed to have it repaired. It may not be color, but it is much more reasonable to use and maintain. Cudos to Amazon for giving me a great price on a great product!!!!!! Cudos to HP for a great old printer!!!!!!"
1,Attorney and CPA,"The HP 92274A Toner Cartridge box had obviously been crushed BEFORE it was packed and sent to me. Although the cartridge itself might not have been damaged, I wasn't going to take that risk because I would not be using it for several months (i.e. AFTER it was too late to return it if it was damaged)."
2,"Our cat doesn't like this food, and the ingredients are very iffy","I'm not really sure what I was thinking when I bought this food, except that I was freaking out about my cat being diagnosed with chronic renal failure. The ingredients in this food are really not something I would normally even consider feeding to our cats, but like I said, I was freaking out! Usually cats like crappy canned food, so I figured, what the hell and opened a can. Not only did our chronic renal failure cat turn his nose up, but so did the other 3 cats. Oh, well! I'm sure it's better than any of Hill's Science Diet products, Purina anything, or Royal Canin's prescription diet, but not by very much."
4,my picky cat ate it.,my 17 year old cat was put on Hills prescription diet k/d. she ate it for a month and got sick of it. now i alternate the two brands and one month later it seems to be going well. I'd recommend getting two brands to alternate since the options are so limited.
2,missionary mama,did not receive the right book....would have liked another method of payment..returned the book which is not what I ordered am waiting to see how this gets resolved..
4,Great album!,"I like this album alot. It was well written, produced, and thought of. It was tight as hell and had some ear-catching rhymes that you'd probably repeat back to your boys! Cop this album"
1,"all but worthless, save some trees instead.","Poor writing, poor editing, minimal information, crude hand drawings. I was amazed that such a low quality publication could be published by Howard W. Sams, with a great reputation in years gone by for top notch technical publications."
2,Not recommended,"Very little detailed information, much too basic even for someone just learning how to use an oscilloscopes. Illustrations are hard to read."
1,Very disappointing,"This book is not worth the money. You can get through the 150 pages of the book in a few hours. The book is very basic. However, the author finds a way to make the book hard to read because Figures relating to the text are on different pages. In general, you can find better information on the net. This book is not a keeper."
2,Nice but defective.,"This is for the FBQ3201 unit. I just brought this unit home and found it to be defective out of the box. If I were to put a reasonably hot signal into channel 1, after a few seconds it the signal will shut off. What is very strange is that if I touch the case body, the signal immediately returns. Does not do this with same signal on channel 2. I cross checked cables and what not. Have to return unit. I will try one more time."
1,Noisy,"I bought it because it had the bonus of a sub woofer out and a lot of other good features for the price. It hissed so loud I took it out of the rack within 30 minutes. I tried TRS cables, XLR and TS, even with the mixing board disconnected, it still hissed. I played with every setting, the only way to quiet it down was to put it in bypass. As soon as I pulled it out of the rack my system was quiet again. They had some good reviews so I don't know if I got a defective one or not. I am going to return it tomorrow and try another brand. I had a behringer compressor a few years back, it died in the middle of a gig. It was only about a year old and always used with a power conditioner, I thought it was time to forgive and forget, I guess not."
5,"Fast, easy",Only need to drill one hole and screw it in. One of the easiest conversions I have ever made. I have now done this with all of my shotguns.
4,Not Dishwasher Safe,"I was happy with the burner covers until I put the 2 small ones in the dishwasher.....The white paint peeled off the small metal rim. I'm going to repaint with an enamel, but I just want to warn others."
3,Still Searching,"Makari worked for me once, but I really don't understand why it no longer works on my skin. I am of African descent and my skin is very prone to hyper-pigmentation at the slightest chance, especially my face; right now, my face is about 4 shades darker than the rest of my body! (seriously), with dark patches on some parts of my face. My friends and family have noticed the darker shade of my face. I used the body beautifying lotion for about six months previously and I saw some change but then when I purchased a new product it suddenly no longer worked. I was getting progressively darker so I purchased the caviar cream, exfoliating soap, clarifying glycerin and night treatment cream all at once and faithfully applied them but did not see any difference. This is 2months later and I am still searching for a product to help with my hyper-pigmentation. Someone please help me!"
3,Did not work well for me,"I did not see any results when using this product consistently, even every day. There was a dark mark that I wanted to lighten and it did not happen for me."
2,Have at Thee!!,Poorly animated and Boooorrring. They should have tried to make the animation resemble the beautiful art found in the original series. It's like a boring saturday morning cartoon. They should take a note from the story interpertation and art used in DC comics animated movies. A what could have been... is a why did they?...
3,Before the hammer...came the sword.,"Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict -- ""Thor: Tales of Asgard is an odd fish indeed. A sort-of-but-not-really prequel to director Kenneth Branagh's live-action spectacular, it covers the same emotional arc and some identical plot points. The whole enterprise smacks of a weird lack of planning by Marvel Studios--especially since this direct-to-video animated feature is clearly designed to syngergize marketing, maximize revenue streams, increase brand awareness, and all that jazz. Add to that that Tales of Asgard catches the young god of thunder before he came into possession of Mjolnir, the world's most badass hammer, and the movie comes off as oddly unnecessary and almost entirely unsatisfying."""
1,the worst,"though i am not a huge marvel animated fan to begin with this is easily the worst of them thus far. marvel unlike dc is using these to appeal to tweens and younger and as such the writing is dumbed down, the action is toned down and there is nothing happening here that is worth your time. if you want a good animated super hero go watch any of the recent dc releases or if you are a die hard marvel fanboy watch hulk vs wolverine. this will leave you dissapointed."
2,What?!?!?!,I think the fact that Thor is holding a sword and not Mjolnir on the cover art says everything you need to know.
1,Literary Crap,"I must be getting old. I have no patience for literary works of fiction anymore. They suck; they're slow and boring and so unentertaining that I want to throw them in the fireplace. What makes this one so bad is that I'm not sure its even literary. I've never read Auster before but got a recommendation to start with this one. It's hard to find any enjoyment in a novel where the main character runs away from society, is tasked to do a hard, endless job, doesn't accomplish it and then kills himself. Oops, I gave away the ending. Believe me, read this book and you'd wish the guy would have done it 100 pages ago and saved you all the trouble. It's not like you're going to learn anything about him, you or life in general--you're just going to be wasting your time. This one is a real stinker and it doesn't hold up over time."
1,I gave it a 1 star because there was no 0-star option.,"There is nothing original about this book. It seems to be just an extension of some junior high dream that Auster once had, before he was allowed to drive and before he learned that we are all in control of our own destiny. The plot is completely unrealistic, absurd, and downright uninteresting. The only reason I read to the end was because, fortunately he had the sense to keep it short. The only good part of this book was when Nashe and Pozzi were staying at the Plaza in NYC. There was a certain anticipation that kept stringing you along. Anticipation of the card game and of the inevitable, trite class clash. Both of which end up to be major disappointments. I wouldn't recommend this inane book to anyone but the most morally inept individuals who may derive from the book that all wrongs must be accounted for in the end, or more simply that gambling is dangerous."
1,Worst watch I ever had,"This watch is a nice looking watch but very bulky. The automatic movement does not work well. This watch keeps poor time, losing about ten minutes a week if you can keep it running. The only way to keep it running is to wear it when you sleep at night. If you take this watch off and let it sit for eight hours it will stop. You have to reset this watch every single day. Also, the latch on the band is very poor and comes undone easily. I used this watch for about a month and threw it in the trash. It wasn't worth the postage to send it in for repair. All in all, the worst watch I have ever owned. No more Invicta automatics for me. The only reason I rated it a 1 star is because they didn't give me a choice of zero stars."
3,Useful as a quick reference,"This book does a good job of focusing on the projects (e.g., reports, memos, proposals, presentations) that engineers are commonly asked to write. It also covers the most common writing mistakes made by engineers (e.g., passive voice). If you need a quick, short answer for a specific task, this book will likely be useful. But it will not provide in-depth training on how to become a better writer. I was also disappointed that it did not address how to work effectively with professional writers or how to provide useful input & reviews - both are common activities for engineers."
3,Wow,this album is not very well put toghether there are some songs that just shouldnt be on there. they couuld have be more diverse but what can you do its out and there are some good songs dont get me wrong but then their are some bad ones also.
1,Need help finding a song...,"Can someone help me get the name of the song that plays when Coach Carter is fired and he's at his trunk and the song that plays has a video to it but I can't remember the artist or the name. I know a part of the verse goes, ""I remember the first time I heard Juicy by by BIG, I was cleanin my the crib with my moms..."" or somethin like that. Can some one help please?"
3,Looking For A Song?,"For the longest time, I had been wanting to know a hip hop song by this artist. They played it as the first song while the team was at a club. Just bought the dvd today and saw the end credits for all the songs that were played in the movie regardless of whether it made the soundtrack. Anyways, the name of the song is called Headsprung by LL Cool J. Just thought I'd let everyone know that had been looking for it."
3,Good soundtrack,"There is also a song in the movie that didn't make it on the soundtrack, I recognized the voice as AnthonyHamilton, and I also saw him perform the song on Chappelle Show. Can anyone help me?"
4,Yo i need help,"can anyone tell me the name of the song that plays when sam jackson is standing in the gym thinkin about whats goin on at the end of the lockout its right before timo cruz's cousin gets shot, please i need to find out i love that song its the one where there just like this --- retaliation, identification, motivation, basically all the words that end in ""tion"" please if anyone knows what song this is post a review and tell me what it is. the soundtrack is good besides the fact that it doesnt have most of the songs you'll hear in the movie, but music really pumps you up. thanks to whoever can tell me who sings the song im looking for and the title"
3,Just telling you what song from intro...,Its a DMX song that didnt make the sountrack same with nina sky and akons hit jams...DMX Grand Champ track 9 untouchable.
4,cute for a jungle themed room,"Bought these to finish out our jungle themed nursery. The animals are incredibly cute. Only issue I had that detracted a star was dealing with the material when hanging it on the wall. Since these are cloth, similar to thin oven mitts, they bow when you hang them by the cloth straps that are attached. They still look nice, but if you are anal about a perfect appearance, like me, you might be annoyed with them not laying flat against the wall and the difficulty of getting them perfectly aligned."
1,Out of Date,"Vendor sent an HP toner cartridge with a 2008 manufacture date. While technically ""new"" in that the packaging was apparently opened, it is actually more than 4 years old. I called the vendor and they said that HP says that their toner never expires. The vendor also said that they will stand behind the product and if there is ever a problem, they will make me happy. I am not yet ready to install the toner since my current cartridge is not yet used up. I am therefore in the uncomfortable situation of having paid for an expensive 4 year old toner cartridge and relying upon a vague promise from the vendor that, when I eventually use it, it will work as it is supposed to. This is not what I was expecting when purchasing a ""new"" product."
4,Works great with Mac Powerbook,"I bought this since my Powerbook support Bluetooth. It worked great from the time I first used it. The Powerbook recognized it immediately after running the ""Setup Device.."" wizard. Now I can just bring the mouse near the Powerbook and it gets recognized and starts working within 5 seconds. I don't have to plug the base station into the Powerbook like non-Bluetooth laptops require. At night I just put the mouse into the basestation to charge so its ready for the next day. I have gotten several days of usage on a full charge. The mouse is comfortable and the buttons are programmable to work with the Expose feature of OS X. This makes navigation of the windows really slick. The only down side was the expense."
2,Extremely poor battery life & precision,I've been very pleased with my Logitech wireless mouse (non-bluetooth) on my PC - so thought I'd buy the Bluetooth version for my Mac Powerbook. Physically the mouse is much flimsier than the other wireless version. From a performance standpoint I seldom get more than 1/2 hour of increasingly erratic use before losing my connection and having to recharge.Looking for an alternative - or may just use the non-bluetooth version on the Mac as well.
3,Enlighten,"SOULGASM by Alice Parris is a collection of poetry that speaks to your inner and outer soul. The book cover is beautiful and will instantly catch your attention.Each poem reflects on something significant about life and emotions. Alice's poetic style is nice, yet incomplete to me because the intensity of some of her selections leaves you hanging. But make no mistake, she speaks in volumes on the soul,love, and emotions.Several selections stood out to my delight such as ""Many Waters,"" speaking on the rivers of pain in our soul; ""The Phoenix,"" focusing on rising up again and ""Two Sides of your Love,"" depicting the sweet and sour of love. They were very uplifting selections which I truly enjoyed.Overall, Alice Parris' collection of poems in SOULGASM provides an enjoyable read while curled up in a comfortable chair with a cup of tea. The selections will provide a poetic appreciation with soaring satisfaction.Reviewed by Kalaaniof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,Don't be a fool and buy this book--Please,"I thought I would give the Fool a chance and buy their book and boy was I ever disappointed. The book is drier than a desert and as stale as week-old bread. There is nothing new here that has not been said before. It seems to me that their books are more about promoting a personality than offering a work that seeks to help people invest their money. I am glad I kept the receipt because I am returning this book, which breaks a rule for me since I rarely do so."
1,no mention of valuation when buying stocks!,"The Gardner brothers make a good case for investing in stocks.There are good explanations of what makes a great business,but there is no mention of valuation.Even THE BEST company can be too high to make a long term profit.One should understand that the companies that are rated in the book have all of the good things baked in the price(reference made to rule makers)."
4,nice intake,"nice intake, took some modifying to fit. but not to much. should have bolted right on for the price they charge."
5,Great Phone,"I Used skype on my computer before, but I never was really convince until I get that phone.Just work perfect for us (we just skype out - no land line). No need to stay in front of your computer to use Skype.Good quality product (plastics). Keys feel nice and strong. Sound is good (no echo, perfectly audible, no complain from call receiver).Good purchase."
3,I Returned This,"I returned this because the receiver is a very flat shape that doesn't really embrace the ear the way a traditional receiver does. Even adjusting the volume to it's loudest, this receiver design requires that you really hold it hard to the ear to get a sufficient audio level.Other than that, I found that the phone met expectations and ease of use but the receiver issue was a deal breaker for me."
4,Excellent Phone but I will like few extra features,"Honestly this is an excellent phone, I like the style, and I love the quality of sound. Personally I will like to have some of the features been part of the phone and not been part of Skype. I can't belive if I dont have connection to Skype, I can have access to my contact list, or been able to check my call's history, this is kind of a drag, for a phone on this days."
5,GOOD SKYPE PHONE. GOOD PRICE. BUY IT,"Yea have have this phone for about 1 month, perfect phone for do free calls on the skype network, easy to setup.. everithing work well! im happy :D I think in the future!"
4,excellent phone overall,"installation is easy and fast and setting configuration is a breeze.the only problem, if at all it really is, when the phone sort of hangs and i have to reset adaptor base by removing the power supply and put it back in a few seconds. not that it really bothers but when i am not around and my wife and kids encounter this problem, they have to call me to guide them thru. otherwise, this gadget is exactly what i wanted...free from PC connections."
5,Great VOIP Phone,"The Philips VOIP8411B has worked perfectly for me since receiving it. The sound quality is easily on par with a standard landline when using Skype and for a fraction of the cost. If you are looking for a Skype phone that does not require a computer, I highly recommend this phone."
2,Dead after 6 months,Okay. Long story short. Two major flaws:1. Battery life extremely short. Can't last without charge over 24 hours!2. Unit completely died after 6 months.SO disappointed.
3,Great - but headset socket prone to breaking,Great phone - however the headset socket is prone to breaking. It has happened to me twice. It is VERY fragile so be careful if you indent to use it frequently.
3,No Volume Control,"I like everything about the product except the fact that there is no volume control. If you hear a little high, then this phone will be totally useless for you."
3,For Peak form read Relic and Reliquary,"Although ""Riptide"" is entertaining, Preston and Child are at their best with Relic and Reliquary. The story doesn't truly envelope you with any mystery or wonder. I'll still admit to being a huge fan, but I'm hoping the next outing will sound less like a movie and more like novel."
5,Another rousing adventure from Preston and Child,"Preston and Child have done it again. This is another gripping adventure set in an absolutely compelling location. The story involves a high tech search for a legendary pirate treasure. The treasure is located at the bottom of an elaborately booby-trapped Water Pit. The Water Pit is located on an island of the coast of Maine. This novel offers everything a reader could want. Action, danger, suspense, a high tech appoach to solving a puzzle that has claimed dozens of lives over hundreds of years. There is also a quest for personal redemption. The main character, Dr. Marlin Hatch, is battling the memories of a childhood tragedy, involving the Water Pit. Preston and Child manage to weave together topics that most wouldn't think to connect. (For example - computer modeling and pirate treasure.) Riptide is another outstanding adventure thriller from the superb team of Preston and Child."
5,Great Treasure Hunting Adventure,This was one of the best books i have read in a while. takes place on the north-eastern fishing coast of th u.s. fast moving with a great cast. you will love this book!
5,Preston and Child do it again!,"Preston and Child bring readers on an adventure of archeology and pirate treasure as they chronicle a treasure-hunting company's attempt to recver the great lost treasure horde of ""Red Ned"" Ockham. Located on privately-owned Ragged Island, this treasure has been the subject of many failed -- and fatal -- recovery attempts over the centuries.The authors again present new characters the reader can relate to, and it doesn't take long to get acquainted with our hero, Doctor Malin Hatch, who has inherited the ownership of Ragged Island.As the plot builds momentum, so do the stakes, as greed and paranoia are compounded by the dangers faced by the recovery team.With $2 billion in treasure at stake, there is little thought of slowing down to avoid the risks.......Grab this book and hold on for the ride!"
4,"Good, but I expected more.","Althought this was an entertaining book, it was not on a par with the authors' prior efforts. It did however keep me interested the entire way."
2,Mild spoiler,"This book was interesting and held my attention to the end (hence the 2 stars). However, it was full of cliches and the end was predictable (and a bit ridiculous). I felt nothing for the characters, who were under-developed, and yes, they were all there: the good guy with the past that still haunts him, the bold and smart heroine, the computer geek, the obsessed bad guy who, at the end, gets what he deserves...Only read it if you like Hollywood-type adventures and don't really care for real literature.That said, if you love Dan Brown, you'll probably like this book."
3,Promising but...,"It was ok. A Stephen King look-a-like, but with less thrills. Honestly, the beginning got me hooked, but I think it's a pity, it trailed off to the end."
2,Great story ends up goofy,I thouroughly enjoyed the first half of Riptide. A great setup for a rollicking adventure story. Complete with pirates and hidden treasure. But towards the middle it starts to lag. The Preacher is a very shallow character as is his wife our hereos first love. It picks up again for a while but there are just too many shallow characters to keep track of. I had to read the last paragraph several times to believe they could end the book in such a Beavis and Butthead fashion.
4,It ain't no Tresure Island !!!,"I have never been one of those who like pirates and buckeneers....""Riptide"" changed my oppinion. It doesn't have the same speed as ""Relic"" or ""Reliquary"" but it does keep you at the edge of you seat...and any book that does that to you, is worth a read...but not on a stormy night !"
2,Seemed rather shallow and unispiring,"I am not really sure what I expected, but I think I expected more than this. I felt the book lacked depth, and I also did not feel that there were any real explanations of how to go about spiritual healing. It seemed to cover the same old ' meditational ' ground over and over, and quite honestly, though I hate to say it, I found it boring."
1,Erotic?,"Sometimes interesting, sometimes not. Click the camera a few times your bound to come out with something good. Slightly tepid."
3,just right for 13 yrs old,"The bike helmet head size is 23 1/4-24 but I would put it this way. The helmet is good for 13 yrs old and around 5'4"" tall. You need a bigger sized helmet if you are older."
4,Bike Helmet,"My first bicycle helmet, so I'm not sure what makes a great helmet. But, it's light weight, good fit, everything I was hoping for. Very happy"
4,"Quality produce, economically priced","This is a quality helmet and is priced reasonably. My only qualm (and the reason i did not rate it 5 stars) is that the tensioner at the back of the helmet is sometimes uncomfortably tight when worn for long duration. This is probably common to all helmets, so i cud be wrong on this. Anyways, i liked the product."
4,Radar Bike Helmet,I like the product fine. It's light and easy to wear . Not too ostentatious. The strap is a little skinny making it cut into the chin a little when properly worn. Otherwise it's just what I wanted.phil
2,Nice price; poor fit,"Fairly attractive, reasonably priced helmet. Ordered small/medium based on head-size (cm.) designations on display page. Could not make proper fit either securely or comfortably (wobbled high on head). Returned (on Amazon's dime) & ordered Bell Citi (safety yellow) universal fit. Much better. Amazon credited my return w/ no problem."
4,Great helmet for casual bike riding,The helmet fits great to most head shapes. The back has an elastic string that fits to most head shapes. The strings under the chin are easily tightened and it is a comfortable fit.
3,Solid,"This helmet gets the job done. The inside seems a little weird and it was hard to get used to as it seemed a little tight. It was not adjustable like the other helmets. If you have a big size head please do not buy this helmet. I have a pretty small/medium size head and it feels tight at times and it was not really what i was looking for, however, I only go for bike rides every so often so it gets the job done for the price."
4,Stylistic but disjointed.,"Bay of Blood single-handedly invented the slasher sub-genre with it's use of a high body count (around a dozen), ton's of gratuitius nudity, and it is the first movie to use the first person camera from the murderers' point of view. Some of special effect's are a little dated now, but they are pulled off very well for their time (70), and this is a very stylistic murder mystery. The only reason I gave this four star's is because there are a lot of character's in the story, because of that it becomes a little disjointed and hard to follow. Also, sometime's the cinematography is a little too experimental with constant fade's, zoom-in's, zoom-out's ect., and even though I usually enjoy experimental cinematography, I thought they went a little overboard. Overall it was a highly enjoyable slasher/giallo with a good plot and stylistic kill's, but I think it could have been better."
3,YUCK....,"Definitely not my favorite Bava film. I waited years for this to come available and was stunned at it. ... The shoestring plot that threads the film together is only a mad scramble over some valuable lake property. What the film actually consists of are some incredibly violent murders that some say coined the phrase ""body count"". Bay of Blood indeed. Just when you begin to understand and care for a character---splat!---they're slaughtered. When the murderer is finally revealed it's hard to believe. ...And the ending---talk about your Poetic Justice! ..."
3,Delicious recipes,"However, many are too fancy or require ingredients that I don't have in my ""meat and potatoes"" kitchen."
1,Horrible Book,I bought this thinking it would give me some ideas on what to grill. The recipes were horrible...such as buying breaded fish fillets and grilling them. Do not buy this book!!!
1,Displeased,"I was very diappointed in this book. It is a bunch of quotes from women of age, I did not find it funny or amusing. I thought I would at least get a few laughs but it was a waste of my hard earned money."
2,Obscure and bleak....an unpleasant reading experience,"I should have heeded the warning at the back of the book. ""Play It As It Lays"" didn't sound like something I would enjoy. But I thought, ""What the heck.....Joan Didion is a celebrated writer and PIAIL was after all shortlisted for the National Book Award"". Having slogged through it and some USD11 poorer, I only regret not having gone with my gut. I was bored to death with Maria Wyeth and her decadent family and friends. They're an unsympathetic lot and deserve everything they get. The message may be biting and stark, but I found Didion's prose, with their ""quick cross cuts and rapid dissolves"", irritating and obscure. It's like watching a bad Robert Altman movie that's shot with a hand-held camera. It gave me a bad headache. Stay away......unless you're a Didion fan."
4,Bleak (and terrific),"This novel follows Maria Wyeth and her depressing journey into darker and darker realms of nihilism. ""Nothing"" is the answer she gives to everything. Her husband Carter is working on a film, and her friend BZ and his wife Helene are going through problems. More about the emptiness of everyday life, especially life in Hollywood, Death Valley and Las Vegas, it presents one woman's withdrawal. Maria has an abortion and then breaks down and cries on the freeway when she realizes that this is the day that the baby would have been born. Her friend BZ is also having problems and commits suicide at the end; Maria's daughter Kate has emotional and chemical problems and the doctors do not like Maria's visits. Maria cannot connect with any of her fellow humans and has trouble maintaining relationships. A serious and depressing journey."
3,"Compelling, but depressing","If you want something to lift your spirits, this isn't it. And yet, I still found myself turning the pages to see what happens to Maria."
2,disappointed,"I've read Joan Didion's nonfiction and loved it... but this book was just not my cup of tea. I'm going to sell it at the used book store, maybe someone will like it."
3,Cowboy Way,"I Seller was good to work with. The dvd was of a sit back in the evening and relax to watch a western genre movie. It had its funny parts as well as serious, however it was not an outstanding or superb movie."
2,Burdensome costruction of text and pictures.,"Puchased these overpriced books that may make nice coffee table accroutemants. I hoped for more, and was disappointed instead. Don't buy these if you want education or even just entertainment."
4,Can't go wrong with GI Joe...,"except that it was a gift for my nephew and I paid to have it delivered 2-3 days and it showed up 8 days later, AFTER his birthday, even after they said they had shipped it the day I ordered it. I was very upset. He loves it and plays with it all the time. Great product, bad service."
4,Great for the beginner.,Very complete. Covers every aspect of proper care and maintenance of your gold fish.
4,Great if you are a professional. Good for home use.,"Good book, I was expecting a more simple book. Comprehensive information. I prefer a simple book, easy to use, basic but helpful information on medications that help on different kind of diseases. Don't need to know on how to perform surgery on a fish and look under a microscope. This is helpful if you are a professional. Great pictures."
5,I love this book! Highly Recommend it.,Fancy Goldfish: Complete Guide To Care And Collecting.Is the book for anyone who loves their Goldfish and want to make sure they arehappy and healthy.The photographs a lone are worth the cost of the book. Seeing all the different types of Goldfish is amazing.One of my favorite parts of the book is about the history of how Goldfish came to be a part of the pet trade.
2,not my cup of tea but ok,d item was not fo me but d bits and pieces ive seen of d show r really gud and if ur n 2 d hole prison ting den dis is a gud 1 2 go fo.
4,"5 Stars for breadth, 4 for depth","In Modelling Transport, Ortuzar and Willumsen touch on a multitude of subjects related to transportation modeling. The book introduces each step under the traditional 4-step transportation planning process in a separate chapter, in addition to topics such as discrete choice analysis. The way the topics are treated is perfect for someone with previous familiarity with the subject; it would be extremely difficult to hammer out all the details of transportation planning in a single 500 page volume. I would not recommend this book to the more inquisitive reader new to the subject as -in most cases- it may not explain why things are done the way they are. That said, I would strongly recommend it as a desktop reference for someone that may need a refresher on some of these topics from time to time. I would've given the book 4.5 stars if half stars were allowed."
5,Financial risk management,"This book is great if you are reading it to complete financial statements audit. The author is linking electronic commerce with financial risk. Some audit procedures are proposed to manage these risk. In general, the book is from a manager point of view and you always find an accountant/auditor point of view at the end of each chapter."
3,Solemn solo superiority,"3 1/2Evans' playful command is on full display even if more can often be less in terms of additional players. He is the rare player that almost always exclusively sounds greater alone, as on only a few tracks here."
3,Please record again without horns!,"The presence of saxophones, flute and trumpet spoils what could have been a superb trio tribute album to Bill's brother Harry. I find those horns so disturbing that they remind me of Yoko Ono singing in a John Lennon's album. I'm sure Lennon's fans dig what I mean.If Bill was alive, I'd beg him to record these materials again in a trio or duo (with base) format."
3,sent wrong book,"Ordered a German Phrasebook, took about 2/3 weeks till I got it.Unfortunately they sent me an Italian Phrasebook (?).Wrote them an Email and they said they sent the right book straight away.That was about a week ago. Haven't received it yet, so I'm still hoping..."
1,criminology book,This book is alright but the reading is kinda boring.The subject is very interesting and I think that there could be a better book to go with it. The author uses words that a lot of people don't hear very often. He uses the word hence alot.
4,It works,"While this isn't the original MGN-3 becuase they cannot sell MGN-3 this country anymore. They made clames MGN-3 helped fight cancer without any proof, IIRC. So the government made them take it off the market.It does help me in fighting colds and the flu. And that is what I use it for, it works."
5,Americana in Print,"These two timeless classics are presented in a very attractive package. The print is large. A few sketches accent the narratives, and obviously the writing is first-rate. Older children will likely enjoy these tales, and any adult who is familiar with both stories, but never actually read them should pick up a copy in the very near future."
3,Disappointing.,"I read on several teachers' forums that this stuff will stick to anything. Finally! I was so relieved to fin a product that would keep all of my posters from falling down anywhere from the next day after I hung them to the middle of the year. It did work on most of my walls, but one of my walls recently got painted and it didn't stick to them at all. I came in the next day to find all of my posters on the floor. I'm still searching..."
2,Cyrano de Bergerac,"I was disappointed in this particular production. It is a film and not a theater presentation and lacked the immediacy of a live performance.. Frankly, it did not hold my attention and I was bored. L. Mendelsohn"
1,How to kill a classic . . .,"For those who cherish Rostand's work and/or love opera, the only reasons to buy this DVD are: (1) To have proof of to what extent a masterpiece can be ruined in the grandest (fabulous stage sets) fashion. (2) To buy as a gift for someone you truly despise. The total lack of melody . . . the endless to the point of nausea recitative . . . negated any glimmer of praise for the creator's sticking to the story line. In fact, fans of Rostand couldn't care less about Cyrano by the time the first act had ended. Come to think of it, was there more than one act? Ultimately, who cares. (Oooooops . . . to give appropriate credit . . . there were a couple of nice looking horses . . . )"
2,"Billy Martin : the man , the myth., boring !",As a Yankee fan as well as a fan of Billy Martin I found this video very disappointng. There were no videos of Martin kicking dirt or screaming at Reggie Jackson nor were there any of his early playing days with Mantle or Ford. It was basically just him talking about teamwork and how he admired Casey Stengal. All well and good but as far as this being a 'must' have for Martin fans this is a 'I can miss it'. Very disappointing for any Martin fan looking for footage of Martin going nuts yelling at umpires which should have been included.
1,im sorry...,"I have a Creative sound card in my PC. I have a Creative Nomad Mp3 player. I love them both. Soo....I figured the Creative 4.1 4400's will be great. Wrong. I really wanted to love these speakers. Truly. But I couldn't. Amazon was fantastic in getting them to me in 2 days...ground. Once they were installed, they sounded ""fine"" at a VERY low volume. Once you decide to crank it up, you have noise all over the place. Gaming? Solitaire might be ok....MOHAA or the like is another story. A couple explosions and it sounds like you've blown up the ""sub"".If you just want speakers to replace the PC speaker, these are for you. But if you want something with great sound and decent power, look elsewhere. I ended up with some Altec Lansing 641's, and I can tell you that I can't be happier. (Just a recommendation)By the way, Amazon fantastic in handling my return."
3,"Great sound, but volume fluctuates","I bought these speakers about a year ago and plugged them into my 5.1 SB Live card in no time. After going from a set of 2.1 Altec Lansing AC-45s, these sounded amazing! They still do-with one caveat: suddenly, without touching the volume controller or speakers, the volume will noticeably jump and fall. It does't skyrocket or go mute. But, it is still an annoyance. I think the problem is in the wiring, but I could be wrong.Overall, these are great entry-level 4.1s. For the price, they are tough to beat. The sound is rich and clear even at high volume. The bass pumps deep and precise without any crackling. Just don't expect these speakers to last forever."
5,Maybe even his best?,Graham's had a great career and I honestly think this may be the highlight of it. The meeting of pub-rock and pop-songwriting on this album is fantastic. The only track that is weak is Soul Time. I want to like that track as much as the rest (I love reggae) but it's hindered by dated backing vocals: women too loud in the mix dripping with reverb.
2,Doll sings too loud and only part of the song!,"The main reason for writting this review is to tell others that this doll only sings part of the song...that's it. When I first got the doll, I pushed the button to hear it sing, and I assumed that once I opened the package and activated the doll, she would sing the whole song. A friend of mine who bought this doll assumed the same thing. I thought this should have been written on the outside of the box.However, this may be a good thing, otherwise I would have to listen to the song forever. I also thought the song was a bit too loud."
1,Eat Drink Man Woman,"I had seen this movie in the theatre - and it had English sub-titles, However, the DVD I received did not have English sub-titles and I don't speak, or understand, Chinese. I returned it and expect a full credit - unless there is a version with English sub-titles, then I will accept an exchange."
5,"Classic, fabulous, and a must-see","Ang Lee is a superb director who has captured family dynamics in modern day China. Whether you are a China expert or just starting to learn about the culture, this is a great way to experience the internal life of an atypical Chinese family. The story will captivate you, the ending will be a surprise."
4,"Simple, precise, nice design","After looking for digital scales, this is the best model I found. It is compact, light, precise, comes is all kinds of colors and is well priced."
5,electronic done right,"Silent Shout deserves to be in the company of such groundbreaking electronic albums as #1 by Fischerspooner and Mezzanine by Massive Attack. Simply put, this is an amazing album from beginning to end. I will admit that I wasn't so enthralled with it on the first, second, or even third listen, but right now I'm absolutely loving it. If you're like me and you didn't get it on the first listen, give it some time and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a shame that this album will stay largely under the radar. The masses don't know what they're missing."
3,Too Much of a Power house,"Dragonball got good at the end of the series. Dragonball Z was fairly good overall. Dragonball GT had it's moments. The only thing I didn't like about this series is that they go too far with the power levels. In fact, in one of these episodes, in one of these volumes of this particular boxed set, Goku was fighting an enemy named Rildo and said something to the lines of, ""He's even more powerful than Majin Buu."" Considering Goku didn't seem to be trying in the fights, that was a lie."
4,Marriage for Maggie by Trisha David (Harlequin Mills & Boon),"Description from the book back cover:All Maggie Cray wants is a quiet life on her own private island. After an unhappy marriage, independence, freedom is what she craves. And that's what she has until Devlin Macafferty and his small son literally crash-land into her haven. They're both in need of refuge and, Dev comes to realise, they're desperately in need of a woman like Maggie too. To Dev and Dominic, marriage to Maggie seems like a perfect idea. For Maggie, marriage is the one thing she won't risk again, no matter how much the love of Dev and his son might tempt her ..."
3,Interesting but not fascinating,"The author has an interesting theory about why the goddess went underground, an alternative to the ""patriarchy took Her down."" It's a little heady and not written in the best way, but definitely interesting and certainly a new twist on the topic."
1,Oh Please...,"I was disappointed in this book. I couldn't finish it. Not only was it historically inaccurate, but the same point was made every other paragraph, sometimes with the exact same wording! This could have easily been a simple ten page essay instead of a stretched too thin book."
5,Perfect Christmas resent for a special girl,"The book is exactly what I wanted for a Christmas present for a 3 year old girl! It is interesting AND educational, teaching her to look beyond her first glimpse of something to see many other items."
2,Taste,They came during a heat wave so some of them melted. However that's not the issue. They tasted burnt and just not that good. The ones at Trader Joe's are soo much better.
2,A night of Repture,The interview between songs does make justice to this DVD and the production is terrible I am not too sure why it was released
4,Great Table - Hard to Assemble,"Once the table is put together it's a great looking piece of furniture and very sturdy. However, the assembly of the product was somewhat difficult and very time consuming. You have to put together absolutely every little piece imaginable. It took my husband and I about 3 hours to put together."
5,A great gift for thriller readers,"I got this book for my girlfriend and she could not put the book down, everyday she was reading that book sometimes until 2 in the morning. excellent book"
5,Excellent Read,"Not usually being a reader of this genre I didn't really know what to expect from The Shadowkiller. However, having just finished the book I can definitely recommend that you read it.It is expertly written and kept moving along in a twisting chase as I wondered what would happen next. The characters are believable and well formed while the huge, scary, intelligent beast that is Big Foot hunts them down for meat and revenge. Crashing through the Big Foot doubters the story brings Urban Myth to life in this well researched and thrilling tale.When do we get to see the movie?"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad translation of a great poet","An example of what happens when someone decides to be a translator without learning the language. There are mistranslations here on every page, of which some are hilarious for those who (unlike Messrs. Jagasich and Ogrady) understand both languages. Be warned--it's awful."
5,Toddler Montessori Class loves this book,"My Toddler Montessori class loves this book. We usually start reading and singing it the beginning of the school year with very young 2 year olds. Usually by Christmas all of the children know most of the words and can sing it. Parents can not believe their child can sing this song and grandparents love it! Sorry it has gone out of print, we have purchased extra's as even board books that are really loved can not with stand more than a year with a class of 2 year olds!"
2,Contains lead,The description did not list that it was lead crystal. Can't use it for a bedside water service drinking from it daily. It's a vase for me now.
3,"want to try, but s&h too high & a lie-48ozs is not 6 lbs !!!!!!","the product description says this weighs 6 lbs. what a sham. it = 3 lbs. i would like to buy these, but they charge so much for the product itself, the s&h needs to be complimentary. in fact, i'll wager lots of low carb dieters would like to buy these, but no one wants to help others rip us off. that's why the 3 stars."
4,Great Project 2000 Reference,"Thanks for this book. Well writen and easy to follow even for the non-professional project manager. I keep it right next to the computer so I can turn to it when I work on my amateurish, but necessary, system engineering schedules. I can only get better at Project 2000 using this book."
3,it's okay,"I had high hopes for this I think, it's still a good book just not what I thought. It arrived very fast and in amazing condition for being used. I couldn't even tell. Not to mention a GREAT PRICE!!! :) all and all it was still a good buy."
4,Extremely Detailed,"This book has almost everything you need to know about anatomy, however it is over 400 pages. You would need to go through whole chapters just to master one part of the body such as the hand or arms. That being said it is a good book, but it is not for someone looking to learn anatomy quickly. It would take you a long time to go through all the material in the book let alone digest it.Another gripe I have with the book is that sometimes it references muscles by their latin name and you have no idea what muscle the author is talking about. That tends to confuse you and you have to spend time to find out which muscles Bridgman is actually talking about. If you are serious about portraying anatomy realistically then this is the book for you- however if you want to learn the basics of anatomy quickly, another book will probably benefit you better."
1,Daily Study Bible for Women,"This is actually a great Bible for women, it is my favorite. However, this is the 2nd one that I have bought and this one is missing pages 791-854. Of course I did not notice this until after the 30 day return policy was up. I have bought many Bibles through the years and this is actually the 2nd time that this has happened. It is very frustrating."
5,White Oval Serving Bowl by Katie brown,"Perfect for many uses. Great for outdoor grilling parties. Ample size for a crowd. In white, it will go with anything. Indoor or outdoor serveware."
3,not what I expected,"The sheets I received did not say ""pima"" the said SATEEN but they are 1000 thread count so I assume they are the same. These sheets are very heavy but somewhat rough to the touch. This is not what I was expecting but make a nice winter sheet."
3,For complete newbies,"I am a fairly experienced programmers who wanted to learn actionscript. So, I bought the only actionscript book I could find. Unfortunately, the book is aimed at *COMPLETE* beginners - this is ""actionscript for super dummies"". For people who find programming scary, like many designers, they probably find the extreme hand holding and snail pace of this book quite comforting, although many of them may even find it patronising.However, at the end of this 300 or so page book, it still hasn't covered a LOT of ground and leaves you at beginner level still. Wanna understand about loadVariables? Sorry, on your own. How about onClipEvent? Only very basic coverage.The stuff it does cover is aimed at doing ""neat"" tricks, there's no depth. Actionscript in flash 5 has turned flash into an incredibly powerful tool capable of some really quite amazing functionality. But you wouldn't know it from reading this book."
3,Advanced???,"I thought this book was about advanced programming in flash but the only advanced thing it has is the word in the title. If you don't know a thing about programming in flash buy this book, otherwise keep out and go to some web like flashkit.com where you really can find advanced stuff."
2,Not there at all,"As a big ActionScript user, I was really disappointed in this book. I think I am going to wait for the Hillman Curtis book instead. Can I get a refund?"
5,very good,A sweet bar due to chunks of maple sugar. The cherries are tart and counter the sweetness a bit.
3,So so,"The paints came on time and in good packaging. However, when I started to use them it seems as if they are starting to to dry."
5,The best finger nail file,"This by far, in my opinion, is the best fingernail file ever made. I'm so sorry to see it not sold in stores anymore."
1,Disappointing!,The surface was too coarse to use on nails. The little metal chips came off when I used it and it cut my finger. I threw it away out of frustration.
2,Not like the original,"Diamon Deb Nail Files 8""I am very disappointed in the modern Diamon Deb nail files. I love my Diamon Deb nail files that were made in the USA a few years back. They are now made in China, and it shows. I recently got a new one and was surprised at how poor it was. The surfaces were much rougher than my made-in-the-USA Diamon Deb nail files, and there didn't seem to be a finer side to it at all. It seemed to tear my nails more than file them (I have thin nails). I will not get another one. I'm trying Ruby and other nail files instead."
2,clumsy and messy,This kit is a little clunky and cheap to use (granted it didn't cost much to begin with). I would have been better off just buying a replacement cue stick or having it professionally repaired.
1,You get what you pay for,"Hmmm, well, the chalk did chalk my cues.....Usually, the tips I use cost at least 10 bucks each, so I only looked briefly at the tips. I would not use them. Very cheap and not worth the installation time.I purchased this item for the glue. It did not work as well as the Tweeten's glue I typically use.Use Tweeten's."
4,"Heavy, but beautiful","The tree was delivered in 2 big boxes, when I was expecting only one.The tree has many pine cones throughout and has a realistic look. It is lit with 1,800 clear/white frost lights which shine beautiful. It comes with a metal tree stand; the tree is very heavy and the stand can damage the carpet. The tree comes in 3 parts, plus the tree stand. The tree parts are heavy, especially the lower two ones. The upper section is not so heavy, but it is difficult to lift into position. Only one person cannot assemble the tree. We didn't have problems fitting the parts. The tree has a huge bundle of wires. It takes a while to fluff the branches.The price was great, I couldn't find another better tree on the market at this size and this price. We are very happy with this tree. We will see how is to put it back in the boxes."
5,"Traditional, Gregorian hymns sung in Russian Orthodox church","If you have ever been to a midnight (Christmas Eve) service in a traditional Russian Orthodox church, the wonderful chanting and hymns wafting down from the rafters, this CD is an auditory recreation of that magical music. It's in Russian. Very restful, peaceful, excellent to help you fall asleep."
3,not so good buy,not worth it ... spend a little more and get the better one ... shows signal as weak when just 20 ft distance from wireless router .... not too much resistance in between either ... i wish i would have spent 10$ more and get linksys
4,Goood for Price,"When it is used highly every day,there is a disconnection almost every other day, however speed is not bad for this price."
4,Good for the price,"Good value, powerful for home usage on the wireless web. Unit is Bulky and should be mounted in a secure spot on the computer."
2,D-LINK ADAPTER,"while it is fast, it is flakey. It doesn't like some of my USB ports. It works well with a powered USB port, but works sometimes with normal USB ports. It gets hot and quits in the middle of a long download when not using auxillary power. I have not rec'd the promised rebate either."
1,"A ""psuedo-science"" to sell books - not based in fact!","Yes, it's true if you eat lots of fruit and vegetables you'll probably lose weight, but not because of any of the ridiculous medical ""facts"" cited in this book. This book is so off-the-wall inane that it's hard to believe so many people are falling for it...."
3,book,I find that this Book has some useful information inside and i some very nice recipes as well as menu plans
3,Vegetarian Guide,"If you are thinking about becoming a vegetarian or you are dissatisfied with the health care you are receiving or maybe you just want to lose weight this is a pretty good guide for lifestyle change. I myself being a meat addict and also one who usually trusts the advice of doctors, have read this book but not have completely agreed with the opinions expressed in the book nor have I been able to follow the diet that is recommended. Stilll, I think becoming a vegetarian and using proper""food combining"" is probably better for your health than following the Atkins diet. In any event this is probably the most interesting diet book ever written."
3,Inappropriate,I found the book to be enjoyable reading but exercise is equally important in any kind of total health plan and I don't feel it has been emphasized enough. And please enough about carrots already!
2,Don't be fooled.... read this.,"I got halfway through the book and was very impressed... I overlooked the things that didn't sound right, because I wanted to believe it all. While it may have some value, before you invest too much energy in it make sure you read the reviews by doctors at the ""health care reality check"" website. hcrc.org. They start ""This foolish diet book, which sold over one million copies, shows how a weight loss program founded on unscientific concepts can be a huge commercial success."" Amazon will be doing it's customers a great dis-service if it does not publish this as it took me a great deal of time to find a credible, qualified reference that reviewed the book properly."
4,Good information!,"It is worth the time to read this and the money investment as well. Learn something every day..... Don't just shelve this, read it!"
5,Great Book for all Leaders,Trust Me is one of those rare books that provides timeless insights with personal insights and help for all of us. Hastings and Potter take the reader on a leadership journey and challenge us at the end of each chapter with thought-provoking questions and personal growth suggestions. I literally could not put this book down! It has helped me and my team to understand how we can be successful leaders. This is a must read for any person wanting to improve their leadership skills.
2,2010 Forecast is Behind the times,This text book is out of date even though it is a forecast up to 2010. The copywrite on it is 2000. Some of the issues the author presents are current for the year 2005 and this is already 2007.
2,Not really for a beginner.,"I like the book. However, I have no idea how to play poker and this did not help."
1,not worth your time or money,"This book was a great disappointment. It is a series of boring pious stories to admonish and reprove the sinner. After you read a few, they all seem the same. It is poorly documented. The stories are taken mostly from regional Christian newsletters. However, worst of all is the fact that the book judges the dying based on their deathbed utterances. This Theology is faulty and does not take into account that the Mercy of God is unfanthomable. It is not for us to speculate who is lost and who is saved."
3,Nicely written but not for the serious doll artist.,"This book was very well written and has beautiful pictures. However, if you want to make your own porcelain dolls from scratch - it's not for you. I was most interested in learning about making molds and wigs and this book pretty much said, ""You can buy a wide variety of these at your local doll supply shop."" I personally don't want to make dolls from a pre-existing mold so there's little I can do with that information. However, many of the techniques are very good and insightful and I will definitely look back on this book once I figure out how to get my molds created. The author definitely know what she's talking about, I just wish she had shared a little more of the little known facts with the rest of us."
2,I Hope Their Estates Get A Share...,"Remember when WB released 2 MGM A&C;'s Lost In a Harem & In Hollywood 5 or 6 years ago?At the RRP of $14.95? For TWO movies???Now we're being asked to cough up @ $25 for 1 film - on a DVD-R - with no extras (not even a menu page!!!!!)C'mon guys, we're a little too greedy, ain't we?"
1,Great while it lasted--5 weeks.,"I bought this right after Thanksgiving and it lasted all the way til 5 days past the return period! Now giving error ""no disc"" messages. Wasted an hour with customer service (1/2 hr on hold), then was told I can mail it to Texas (at my expense) for them to replace or repair. I've had it five weeks and then am to lose it for proabably two? Hello? On top of everything, it stopped recording on the night I was performing on a national broadcast--adding insult to injury. Am hoping Best Buy will take it back under their extended Christmas return policy. They're usually pretty good--at least SOMEBODY stands behind their products!"
2,Does not record from PAL signal source,"I was looking mainly to record form my Sony Handycam (DCR-HC40E), but, since, it does not accept PAL signal, it does not work for me. I guess my research was not proper. This model does not accept (and output) anything other than NTSC signal, hence, it will not work out-of-the-box in countries like India. Fact that it only accepts NTSC signal was not highlighted in the product literature/brochure available online.However, as a DVD player it is excellent- outputs very good video (NTSC only and US region/universal DVDs).Bottomline:Pros:Similar Sony model available in India (RDRGX330) is priced about 18000/- INR in white market. For ~150 USD it was good saving.Picture quality of output videoCons:Could not really test the recording feature yet. I am procuring external PAL - NTSC video converter to exploit its recording feature.No PAL support (needs external video converter)"
1,Question about RDR-GX355,"This is not a review, but a question from a prospective purchaser: The copyright protection feature seems to be a stumbling block. Isn't there a way to disable this feature (without ruining the machine)? Is there another machine that does the same job without the protection feature? Thanks,Allan/NYC"
1,Bad!,"These essays attempt to refute Calvinism without providing a consistent alternative. Many of the essays attack one point of Calvinism with the unstated assumption that the other four points are false. Most of the rest of the essays use ""that's not fair!"" reasoning and ignore scripture.Some of the highly-questionable claims made in the book are: - Omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence must be redefined. - The future hasn't happened yet, so it doesn't exist to be known. Therefore, God does not know the future. As a result, prophecy is not a foretelling of the future. Instead, prophecies are predictions or warnings based on exhaustive knowledge of the present and the past. - If God has the power to grant salvation, then ALL humans are entitled to salvation. - Universal salvation is a possibility. (Proverbs 16:4 and Romans 9 are not discussed.) - God is unable or unwilling to irresistibly change a human's will. (Paul's conversion is not discussed.)"
3,A modern king Arthur?,"I had been warned by others who enjoyed Lawhead's Pandragon series on the Arthurian legends that these don't translate very good into a modern setting. But, as I've enjoyed his other books a lot, I took a chance on reading it. It turned out to be all too true. Lawhead has not managed very well to bring the magic of the old celtic legends into a modern setting. When Mr. Embries sings, a scene that would have left the reader awestricken, set in a celtic environment, it seems... sentimental. Morgian seems like a real bimbo, and James' feelings when he discovers his lost memories, the way they are described, seem... silly. I've decided to give the book 3 stars, because it's not completely without good sequences. Both the beginning and the wedding feast reflect the brilliance of the author, but the rest does not give him too much credit."
4,Great remake,"Great remake of a hard to find classic movie. I went to the movie theatre to see the original movie and have always been a Bruce Lee fan. Watching this remake was very satisfying, but since it is Blu-ray I expected to be blown away with the visual but was not. Video is good but I thought Blue-ray meant a wow! video experience and it isn't wow! on my Pioneer Blu-ray player and Sony Bravia 40"". Still if you love kung-fu movies this is a great buy!"
2,Truly Weird,"A project conceived by Bruce Lee and James Coburn. Carradine appears in a number of different parts -- in that aspect it reminds me of Kirk Douglas in the LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. Quirky, odd with a lead who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. For those who collect such things."
4,Keep reading,"I was disappointed in the first few chapters because of all the side talk about decorative items . However, I powered through this and enjoyed the book. It's a good story, after all, and very typical of this author."
1,Psychobabble,"If you doubt that too much education can be a bad thing, read this book. Utter garbage from a Clinton sycophant."
4,Huge variety and well received by my kids,"I have a 3 1/2 year old boy and a 1 1/2 year old girl and they both love the videos in the set. If you're expecting Disney, buy a Disney video which are great in their own regard. These take the stories and the images from the books and build upon them so it's like expanding on the visual experience from the books.Both of my kids LOVE books and reading and staring at the images. These videos captured that experience for times when reading isn't practical."
2,Ok....I guess.,"Overall, not quite as good as I had hoped. My son (3) has always loved reading stories together; regrettably he doesn't much care for this dvd collection. There certainly are a lot of stories in this collection.... just not a lot of good stories. Less than 20% of the stories consistently hold his attention for the whole feature when we watch them together. I picked these up for my son when the item was on sale - (paid roughly 40 cents per story)- I would not recommend paying much more than that for the collection."
3,Meh,"It's ok. Some of the stories are read along with the pages, some have animation, others are just a little bit creepy looking. I think it's way overpriced. When I bought it, I got 2 sets as a lightning deal for $40. I still think that's a wee bit much. I have a 13 year old, 3 year old, and 18 month old. I think the 13 year old & I watched more than the little ones. It just doesn't seem to hold their attention the way reading to them myself does. They'll watch a little bit and then go off and do something else. Maybe when they're a little bit older we'll get more use out of it. I probably would not buy the set again. I'd rather borrow the books from the library and just read them to the kids myself."
2,"Why, oh why do you keep changing the formula, Dr. Ken?","Both my wife and I kept getting stained teeth from alcohol-based mouthwashes, so about three years ago, much research and experimentation led us to become fans of Dr. Ken's amazing, all-natural, alcohol-free mouthwash. My wife is very particular about the taste of her mouthwash, which had already ruled out Biotene.In the intervening years, it seems Dr. Ken keeps diddling with the formula. The first twist was not bad, as it ""lighened"" the wash somewhat (you will note that this mouthwash will stain your porcelain sinks, unless you diligently rinse and wipe the sink each time after rinsing).But the last batch we bought from Amazon has not only new packaging (a white bottle), but has a completely different balance of ingredients, and it tastes TERRIBLE! I don't mind as much, but my wife can no longer stand the stuff, so it's back to the drawing board to find a new mouthwash.Wish I knew why you had to spoil a good thing, Dr. Ken."
3,Grupos Finitos de Reflexiones,"This is not my review; but I have consciously read this book (chapters 1,2,3,4,5) for preparing my thesis, and I was thinking about the translation (from English to Spanish)of this book."
4,real catchy,this Jam was catchy the first time that i heard it&I still bump to it whenever I hear it.it has a cool groove&you hear a Cameo vocal influence within it as well.the Ghost of Larry Blackmon(who is still very much Alive) is echoing through Andre3000.
2,It is not a fun,"A trio of CIA-linked Americans saved Russia from a civil war by orchestrated Boris Eltsyn election campaign.If something positive in this work was, it is deploying the USSR-grown talented migrants to create this film itself being as much true and clever as Tatiana Dyachenko-Eltsyn's daughter similarity not existing to Tatiana Dyachenko original."
3,well built,"This is a good gouge and feels solid. The steel seems to be of a good quality. I do not do much carving but I did not own a good gouge and bought this just to have. I've used it about a dozen or so times. This chisel needs to be honed before use, and if you aren't good at sharpening to begin with this isn't easy. If you are experienced at sharpening then you will get a good edge on it. On the whole a quality tool."
3,Buck Brothers Gouge,"I thought I was buying a gouge made by Difenbacher, or some house brand. It's a Buck Bros. gouge that is terribly dull when you get it. I've sharpened it, and it's fine. I don't know what else to expect given the very low price. I shouldn't be I guess, but I am somewhat dissapointed. It's a serviceable tool for $18. It is what it is."
5,Wonderful read wonderfully written,"John Toland is a master. I have read three of his books on WWII and each is a masterpiece in its own right. ""The Last 100 Days"" is a perfect example. I couldn't put this book down. I have little time to read for fun but when I get my hands on a book like this my time flies!!! ""The Last 100 Days"" cover exactly that, from a multitude of perspectives: Soldiers: German, Russian, English, and American; leaders; and civilians. It's a story that could have only been told this way by someone with Toland's talents. His words always seem to come alive and ""100 Days"" is not different from other works of his I have read (""Battle"" and ""Adolf Hitler""). Despite the fact that I am pretty versed with WWII and the end of the ETO,fall of Berlin, etc., I was on the edge of my seat reading this book. It wasn't so much from new content but just in the way Toland tells the story. I highly recommend this book to both beginners and seasoned buffs alike. Its wonderful reading!!!"
5,Preserve,"If you were going to buy only one Lincoln biography in your life, this is it. A wonderfully told story. Many viewpionts. I love the actors high, squeeky voice they use for Lincoln. The honesty Lincoln expressed in the sadness he felt that the Negroe had caused America, a terrible idea from the British, slavery. His plan to ship the Negroes back to Africa, and later, to resettle them in Panama, to untimately, letting stay in America with freedom. A moving Dvd, suitable music. But it!"
2,Revolution,"Revolation: VERY Dumb ,VERY Slow,Very Poor Story Line and a total waste of my time!!!! Very Good show for sleeping.And would like to get that part of my LIFE BACK!!!!"
1,Gawwwwwwd!,"Never in my life have I seen so many people- without running water- without food/proper nutrition- without medicine- without personal hygiene products- without washing machineslook so clean, athletic, fit and well dressed! I cannot wait to see how I look when the power goes out!"
3,More than I wanted,I had to buy the whole season but all I wanted was the 1st two episodes. This was NOT stated at the outset. I feel that the advertising was deceptive.
2,Rip off of The Hunger Games,This show is a rip-off of the Hunger Games! And it's not even done well. I canceled my season pass.
2,Boring,"Very intriguing concept and typically love JJ, but this show is just too boring for us. Reminded us of Flash Forward, but not near as interesting as that show was, and it was canceled after just one season, but if we hear it gets good later, might give it a second chance."
5,Revolution,"I really dont care what any of you think, this is a fantastic show, and none of you would know that if it bit you. you just like the stuipdreality crap that takes over t.v. anymore.. get real and with the program"
3,Why do I keep watching?!!!,"I have watched them all and I am not sure why. Kind of like being fascinated by a train wreck. 5 years of acting and 10 episodes later, Tracy Spiridakos remains a mediocre talent at best. Her expressions come off as painfully contrived and difficult to watch. Reminds me of Layla in ""The Event"". I have to guess that it is all of the other solidly portrayed characters that keep me watching even though the lights out scenario makes no scientific sense. More attention should be payed to what people would actually do under this kind of duress. After 15 years of scavenging, how the heck are you going to kill an adversary and leave his weapons behind? This bunch should have a considerable arsenal of their own by now."
4,Entertaining,"We enjoyed the pilot for the show. It is entertaining, but you have be willing to suspend belief for it to be convincing. It has a few technical flaws. The character development was done well. They are willing to sacrifice those that appear to be main characters leaving you in suspense during the show."
5,A good series!,"I'm one to always look ahead and be prepared for whatever may happen. I believe this series is a documentary to give the viewer a heads up on what could happen to this planet if the lights go out or some other cataclysmic event (natural or man made) should occur. It shows what we are capable of in order to survive. Never giving up and not giving in to all the negativity surrounding us, Charlie is determined to find her imprisoned brother and Aaron, Miles and Nora are committed to helping her and helping others along the way, no matter what. It's that determination and commitment that shows how connected we are to each other and how the choices and decisions we each make affect the outcome of any situation. It's a great show!"
5,great in steamed milk,"this is for anyone who loves the Italian dessert drink of steamedmilk with almond, the syrup is all that was promised"
3,I've Seen Better,"I am recently back from my second lengthy trip in as many months. For the first trip I used Abroad: A Travel Organizer and JournalAbroad: A Travel Organizer and JournalFor the second, I decided to try Distinations. The reviews are correct about the look and feel of the book, it is quite nice. However, the format leaves much to be desired. It is much more of a momento than something to help organize your trip. The Abroad journal does a much better job at helping to keep your flight information, hotel address and confirmation numbers, car rental information, etc organized. It also has pockets to store receipts or tickets and gives ample space for journaling."
3,Too small and lots of extra stuff you don't need,"It looks pretty and if you are just writing a log at home after your trip, a short trip, then great. I was gone for 6 months backpacking Asia and found it wasn't nearly enough room. Plus all the extra stuff looks nice but it's really useless."
3,"Handy, but incomplete","The book can be helpful as a resource on numerous foods. It is particularly useful if one is interested in the history of the food's origin. However, if your main objective is to determine a food's nutritional value, the book is cumbersome in its often lengthy narratives of the food's origin, on what ship it came to North America, which king first popularized it in what continent, what was historically quoted about it, and in which country it is now popular (etc, etc). Mention of food value is of course included in the narrative, but it is inconsistent and often missing. Nutrient content tables are also included for many foods, however, without any comparable reference, how are we to know that 0.14 mg of thiamin or 175 mg of potassium is considered to be neglible or plentiful amounts of the nutrient? The book could be significantly improved if the historical narratives are minimized, and if comparative nutrient content is included."
2,NEED TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE BATTERIES,"Because the recorder cannot be turned on and off, the batteries are constrantly being drained. In other words, even if you do not use the recorder for a couple of weeks, you may find that you not longer have charged batteries, and therefore have to continually replace, reprogram, etc."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"This book is poor. No way to use it. The ""verses"" are not original. Don't help you as an awo or babalawo. Don't help you as a ifa student. You will not find here relation with others Ifa texts."
2,A BIT DISAPPOINTED,"I ordered this cleaner based on my past experience with Bissell products. However, I was a bit disappointed with this ""deep"" cleaner since it did not deep clean properly, and hot water is insufficient both in volume held by the cleaner and in it's capacity to ""steam clean"" the small carpet area I concentrated on. I would have returned the cleaner if it was not such a hassle to do so."
2,Don't Recommend,"Have owned this model for about 1 1/2 years. Cleans all right, but have had problems with the spraying mechanism since day one. Was told by Bissel customer service that the water reservoir needed to be full to assure proper pressure gradient for machine to spray properly. Machine has worked sporadically and has now completely quite spraying. Will be going into the trash today and I am now looking to buy another cleaner. Would not buy this machine again."
2,Not a good purchase,"I have owned this and another carpet cleaner for several years now. I have not used this machine for some time, but recently pulled it out when a friend borrowed my other one. It reminded me of just how awful this machine is, which prompted me to write this review. The suction is terrible, it seems like you only get about a quarter of the water in the recovery tank that what you put down, leaving you with overly wet carpets that aren't even cleaned well. I would NOT reccommend this product."
4,Decent for the price,"I just got it this weekend and cleaned our downstairs carpet which is very old and in pretty bad shape. It looks a lot better after using the steam cleaner. My only suggestions are that if you have a large area of carpet to clean, you may want to look for something that is made to cover a larger area. Our living room is probably about 200 sq. ft. and I had to empty the dirty water tank at least 4 times and refill the water/carpet solution tank about the same number of times. Of course, I wouldn't expect much more than that since it was pretty much the cheapest upright option."
1,I love rock & roll; hits of the '50s,"This is, by far, the worst CD I have ever heard. I grew up in the '50s and know that these are not the original artists who are listed. Whoever is pretending to imitate them is not even close. The musicianship and recording qualities are horrible; if the songs had been done well by other musicians, it would not be quite such a disappointment!"
3,duplicate item,recieved & was charged for two of these (2 seperate shipments) - returned the duplicate. waiting for credit
2,Remote,This is a delightful and silly movie that is wonderful for kids. The main character is a slightly nerdish boy who gets in trouble and his parents threaten to take away his dozens of remote controlled toys. He takes them to a vacant house and uses them in a number of silly situations to out whit and capture some bungling robbers who have just robbed a convience store. My children are 6 and 9 and love this movie.
5,Best band you never heard of....,"Get all the Gourds you can, hurry. American music with intelligence, humor, and honesty. See them live too!"
1,I wish I could give it a zero!,"Kelly Yarbrough's credentials in the back of the book would lead someone to think that she is a seasoned professional. I was given this book by a friend,we are both in the real estate business, and she thought that it was supposed to be a funny book. She had not read it. It is not a funny book, it is a realtor bashing book, and Ms. Yarbrough represents the worst in our industry as far as I can tell. Having been involved in real estate sales for 18 years, I can honestly say she paints an unfair picture of the people that I have known who do the best they can to help people through one of the most stressful and trying times of their lives, moving their families into a new home, their biggest investment. Just an awful book that gets a lot wrong."
5,Fine Product for Bike use,These shorts were just what I needed for use on my bike. They are comfortable--- fit well and provide adequate coverage!
4,in a nutshell,"This book on blackjack has very well researched mathematics combined with actual play tested decisions. It is full of nitty gritty common sense gaming principles which are a must for all players going to the casino ""hoping"" to win money at blackjack. Some of the betting strategies can be applied to other games in the casino and each chapter is concise and well written. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in blackjack or other casino games."
5,"Wonderful Pictures, Wonderful Recipes...","Though some of these recipes are a little out there, most of them are simply delectable. The book provides a great feel for the flavor (pardon the pun) of the region and some wonderful recipes."
3,English Comedy,"We have watched the first disk of the set of ""Some Mothers Do ""Ave ""Em.It was funny... not as funny as I had remembered but Michael Crawford is a good commedian. We enjoy all his facial expressions,mannerisims etc.Some may not know that he also sang the lead role in ""Phantom of the Opera"" He has a wonderful voice. A very talented man.We are looking forward to watching the rest of the set. I'm sure anyone that enjoys British comedy would enjoy this collection.Di"
3,Sound Quality,"I bought this collection set to view with my Dad over Christmas. I watched this series while living in the UK and Switzerland and was looking forward to sharing some laughs with my Dad. Sadly, the sound was bearly audible."
3,not my favorite,"This was the first DVD from Amy Bentos I have ever ordered and I must say I was very disappointed. I ordered it because I generally love kick boxing moves AND it was a long workout however I was so frustrated because I couldn't keep up with her. By the time I finally did get the hang of a sequence, she was on to another and so I don't feel I got the heart pumping I was use to with The FIRM DVD's I have or Jillian."
4,Pop-n--Swap,"The old ones came out, and these puppies popped right in. No more dingy, pitted lenses diffusing my wife's headlights. These survived -50 Alaska winter nights. The price was reasonable. My wife loves them. What more could I want?"
3,Nice,"Its a nice watch, but just nice. Has an inexpensive ""timex"" feel to it. I like my Seiko better, but this is a nice watch for everyday use."
4,Great Fun,"I liked this movie. Allen's writing is ""tip top"" and his interaction with Keaton is great. As I watched this movie, I kept thinking about Annie Hall. The two leads play well off each other and the co-stars are just as great. Alan Alda and Anjelica Houston are fabulous. It was a romp and I am going to buy this video for my Woody Allen collection. This is up there with Bullets Over Broadway. Both movies also have great jazz . . . alot of the 1920s type jazzy music. I love it and would recommend this movie as one of his best."
3,Diane,How many times does she touch her nose and those belts. Typical Woody. Drink lots of wine and enjoy the night. Fun Movie
2,Allen's style of mystery,"Manhattan Murder Mystery - however, nothing is mysterious. The movie does not create an atmosphere of suspense, but it swells with Woody Allen's style of neurotic representation of dialogues. The spontaniety of talking totally destroys the so-called 'mysterious spots' of the movie. As a super Woody Allen fan, I am rather disappointed of it."
1,Where is my book??,"Ordered one little book over a month ago ....was told I should have my book by 11/03/08, and as of today 11/12/08 I have yet to see my book. Does it take over a month to receive ONE book?? Not pleased in the least as I am waiting for this book so I may read it to my BLIND sister. Not happy at all. NO star for you!"
4,Good beginners book,As the title implies it is a beginners book. I felt it could have covered a little bit more but again there was no false advertising when it states beginner level. (Which is definately where I was when I bought it).
4,One of Joan's most erotic performances; a primar on kissing!,"For the Severance fan, the movie starts rather slow. However as it progresses there are some excellant takes of her expressions. The male lead was lacking in expression but Joan more than compansated for him. The out-takes of this film must have been terrific!"
1,An Awful Conversion,The Kindle conversion of this translation apparently has hard-coded carriage returns <CR>. The body of the text has left widows throughout. Modifying the justification did no good. It is nearly unreadable from a mere failure to strip the returns.
4,Garden Birds,"Item arrived in a timely manner, and in excellent condition. Book has wonderful pictures, and written instructions. Great for decorating small items, and how to paint feathers."
5,heart and souls,"I love this movie. It's a love story with a twist. it's not only about finding and holding on to love, but also about friendships and assisting the ones you love to resolve their lives. it is funny and amazing at the same time. I highly recommend it."
4,Heart and Soul has heart.,"This movie is a must for any Downey fan. It has a little of everything comedy, drama, and romance. The story is basically about 4 individuals all killed while on the same bus. Their souls are connected to the nearest baby being born(downey's character). The little boy grows up having ""imaginary friends"". Of course, once he's in school this poses a problem for him. He's seen talking to himself, etc. His school begins to think he's in need of therapy. The souls do the selfless thing and disappear(though they are still with him). The man he becomes is a bit of a jerk. Eventually the souls reveal themselves when they find out that he is their corporeal being to be used to tie up their loose ends here on earth. Along the way Downey's character learns a few lessons and becomes a better person for it."
5,Heart and Souls,One of my wife's favorite movies and now on DVD! Puts a smile on her face and lifts her spirit every time she watches it. It's the first DVD she lends out when someone needs a care package.
4,Great Value. Good Flatware.,"This set of flatware is an excellent value. It isn't ""silver"" nor does it have the weight of expensive flatware but that is ok because this isn't expensive flatware.The knives appear to be molded and the rest of the pieces appear to be stamped. The forks and spoons may look a little flimsy but do not feel flimsy at all -- a good feel.A couple things to be aware of:Only the knives have the nice thick ends. The various forks and spoons have a shaped but clearly stamped end. It still has a nice feel but we were suprized when we opened the box.The thick ends on the knives are ""thick"" which means that when you stack them in your drawer you may have to alternate direction for the knives (minor knit).All in all this is a good, everyday set of flatware that we're happy we purchased."
3,"Good price, not great quality","I am comparing this with some Flight flatware from the 1970s. Although Oneida says the flatware is 18/8 gauge stainless steel, I think it is flimsy. Ok for the price though. If I paid for it I would return it."
1,The Worst Underware Since the 50's,"Well i bought 2 pairs of these boxers, they are a nightmare, your genitals cannot breath and you get a rash .... i wore one of them for 2 hours and then i had to throw them away..... so guys if you are thinking of buying this item.... think again ....."
5,Good,This was a good creation because my iPOD was full of scratches and it looked bad. Now I have protection.LOL
3,Where's the beef?,"Masters of Networking offers some warm and inspirational stories, but fails to serve up meatier content. I found many stories about the greatness of networking, but few articles that offered effective strategies.I also didn't like the books tendency to be repetitive to a fault. For example a lot of the articles tell you not to be a ""bore."" This is an important fact, but I am smart enough to get it the first twenty times.I enjoyed this book, but it didn't help me much....although it did allow me to write a review with a lot of buts."
5,Tom Waits RULES!!!,"I have to say that when I went to see this movie, I was unsure of what to expect. I knew nothing of Tom Waits, except that he was the favorite musician of a friend of mine. I was terrified that I would be bored to sleep, but I went with a forced open mind. This movie floored me!!! It was absolutely thrilling. I became a big fan about 15 minutes into the movie....he has tapped into a universal human understanding. He is an amazing character that weird doesn't even begin to describe, and I don't think that anyone else could get away with his performances without looking seriously stupid. All that said, he is simply AMAZING!!!"
4,Scratch ship modeling,"Ship Modeling from Scratch: Tips and Techniques for Building Without KitsA very good supplemental book for building a model ship from scratch. It has detailed suggestions that aren't found in many other books or articles. Edw. Leaf knows his stuff and covers all major topics in modeling w/o a kit. He does provide ""tips and techniques"" as the subtitle says, just not quite enough to start scratch building w/o several other sources that go into more depth in important topics/skills."
2,Dissapointing,"This book looked so cute online, but I was really disappointed when it arrived. The text was overly simple and not very catchy or fun. We almost didn't give it as a gift as we originally planned. Pretty disappointing overall."
2,Music not as cool as Eins,"To be fair, I don't understand German crisply so I'm focused more on the music and the tone/delivery of the lyrics. Given that, I think Kopfschuss is a letdown follow-up to Eins (aka Wer Bist Du), which delivers more guitar-driven songs with attitude and some variety, and I think really excellent. I also prefer Himmelfahrt because there is a bit more variation in the songs - not quite so repetitive."
1,CD-2 is Defective,"It's a brilliant performance, make no mistake, well recorded - chorus, organ, soloists. But disc 2 hangs up repeatedly. Too much hassle returning so I thought just to note here. Don't post if inappropriate location.m"
2,"Some hits, lots of misses!","On paper it looks like a definitive collection of Paul Anka recordings from the 50's through to 1970 aproximately.Sadly, it isn't. The recordings are from his RCA period so all the old 50's hits are re-recordings; a number of great originals form his '60 RCA period are left out (Still of the night; Loneliest Boy; Love makes the world go round). Worst of all, of his RCA original ""Remember Diana"" not the original version is included (which is one of my all-time Anka favorites) but a schmaltzy re-recorded version!!!"
2,I'm giving the book to Goodwill,"I bought the book becuase I like to try new and varied dishes. The first (and only!) thing I made was the Ginger-Curried Pumpkin Soup. It sounds delicious but it's the only thing I've ever made that almost made my husband throw up! In retrospect, it does seem questionable that the recipe calls for 4 cups of pumpkin and 1 cup of onion. Raw onion is really potent! There must be a typo with the quantities but a lot of the recipes are complex and I don't want to take my chances again. So I'm giving this to goodwill.On a more positive note, I do have to admit that I found some of the information on the raw foods diet quite interesting."
4,some real raw gems,"I discovered ""Living Cuisine"" while cooking for a yoga ashram. The ashram was the perfect laboratory for experimentation in creative cooking. The yogis were hungry after a rigorous class and the kitchen had every beautiful ingredient you could hope for plus the tools to make it work. Almost every recipe that I made from the book was a culinary delight and the hungry retreatants ate with furvor. Some of the cheeses did not work out and it might have been me and there is some fluff in the beginning before she gets to the recipes but overall it was a winner for me and took the raw experience from being about just salads to a wonderful world of artistic raw food. The book has been around for a while and is a steal for the price.raw food, cooking"
2,Plenty of Filler,"Got this one for a gift...recipes look good but fairly complex..OK or the occasional gourmet meal but nothing I would use daily. What I mostly object to is all of the pointless information about each and every kind of possible ingredient that fills the first half of the book. Useless tidbits like: ""Lemon: This fruit has yellow skin and flesh"". No kidding! Then the author goes on with each and every variation of each kind of fruit. Do you really need the description for 12 different varieties of apple? I guess if you want to be a gourmet raw chef this might be useful information, but for the average aspiring raw foodist there are far better books out there with much more information that you can actually use."
1,Duellists (Ws Sub),"This is NOT the widescreen collector's version, even though the package, DVD and Amazon say it is!!!!!"
5,Best Book on Capoeira,"The Little Capoeira Book is one of the best books to be ever written on capoeira. Everything from the history, music and movements of capoeira. Highly Recommended."
4,The Best Hands On Capoeira Primer,"I read this book after studying Capoeira for four years. I would recommend it to anyone considering studying this beautiful and dangerous art and also to those of us with experience. (Great source of new moves for roda)Classes here in Miami are in Portuguese so this book filled in the holes that my sometimes limited language ability could not. Nestor also avoided alot of the political hot buttons on which style is best that other capoeira books exploited. Please remember: this book is not a sufficient replacement for studying with a mestre or a contra-mestre. Learning to play the instruments, singing the chants, and the ritual of batizado (baptism) cannot be experienced from a book-they must be lived."
1,Best of the what ?,"This a far cry from what the 80's were about and a fantasy for the artists on this album hoping that they were the best of what the 80's had to offer. The CD features Cinderella w/ ""Dont know what you got"" This was a good song for Cinderella, a nice ballad from an era where ballads sold the album. Play music that you love to play and hope the fans love it as well. Dont write a song based on the a certain demand or for a certain demographic. 80'S metal was about Van Halen, Motley Crue, Ronnie James Dio, Ozzy, Ratt, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and to not mention AC/DC would be just wrong as was who ever came up with the idea to do a best of 80's cd without the above artists on it."
4,Great value for the money,"How much longer that this go on? This was my question when I first attempted to do the entire workout without realizing that the workout clocks at more than 2 hrs.... rookie mistake!!!! hahahahaAnyhow, I love the variety of the premixes and the effort put into the DVD to offer a solid toning/sculpting workout. I like the variety of equipment used, but I would have loved to hear or see alternatives. Not everybody has every single piece of equipment needed, and it is a bummer not to be able to follow along in some cases. I can see this one becoming a go to for overall body sculpting and toning."
2,Code errors confuse my students,I'm a full-time web development instructor with both high-school and returning adult students. I am using this book in my web design class. I liked the introductory chapter and the chapter on tables. However my students and I have run into a number of code errors (especially in the frames chapter) that are unacceptable. So I will continue looking for an excellent instructional book on web design. This book doesn't fit that criteria and I will not force it upon future students.
2,"Too Basic, only useful part of the book is the CSS but it's very limited","This book is a bit outdated but it was required for my Web Development and Design class for college. If you have NEVER been exposed to HTML or CSS then you will find it helpful. If you already know HTML and only need to learn CSS, you are better off learning CSS off the web or a book dedicated to CSS. With this book we had to use the Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 book by Shelly Cashman Wells Freund. For the brand new price of this book, it would be wiser to spend that extra money elsewhere. But if you really need this book you should rent the book for class from Chegg (that's what I did).I started HTML in 1998, the only thing I saw useful was using CSS to make your pages uniform. The book doesn't really teach how to make re-usable templates which would have been useful. You're better off getting a reference book if you want to learn HTML & CSS tags and how to use them."
3,Ay! Senor Griffith!,"Being a huge fan of both Shannon Tweed and Andrew Stevens, I immediately purchased this video. I was satisfied with the film overall. Shannon Tweed has proven to be a versatile character actress and is complimented well by the sharp, witty, and sophisticated Andrew Stevens. While the ""hot-scenes"" are few and far between, resulting in the lowered rating of this film, the nuanced performances and crisp script make this film worthy of any Tweed fan's collection. A must!"
1,Not for under 5 year olds,I thought this book would be for a little child of firsts but it is more like 5-8 year old humor. Cute idea but not for little ones.
2,Essentially boring,It reads like a bad text book and touches on everything but covers nothing. I wish I had given the money to a worthy cause.
4,Good book,"I appreciate this book for its engaging introduction to Ruby-on-Rails, and for the agile programming lessons.A downside is that it seems to have more errata than you'd like; some code doesn't work, and I'm not knowledgable enough in Ruby or Rails to fix it.Before you buy this first edition, note that the second edition is already out in beta for download, and when you buy the beta, you get all subsequent updates for that edition free."
1,Superb organization awful content,"The range of story and poetry selections is so limited, the materials bore students to death. The issues the texts are obsessed with--morbid existential guilt, death of a spouse or a parent ala Joyce, O'Connor, Cather, etc.,--no longer have the spell-binding effect they once had on the adult sensibility. We now live in an age where more dramatic problems occur. There has got to be some good literature that covers issues of our day, such as mass murder, rape, school-shootings, hysteria, incest, money problems, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious intolerance, etc. This textbook is totally out of touch with the current realities of our lives in the 21st century."
1,history not haunting,"This book is very interesting from a historical viewpoint--lots of background about the founding and growth of the city of Chicago. But hauntings? Not so much.It's really about 80% history and 20% hauntings and none of the photos are remotely paranormal.Throw in dozens of typos and grammatical errors (did anyone proofread this book?)and the author's love of exclamation points, and it's a hard book to like."
1,NOT YSL Paris,"I have worn Paris for years, and it is one of my signature scents. Imagine my disappointment when I opened and tested this product and found out it smells nothing like it should, in spite of authentic-looking packaging. I am involved with the Tuccini Corporation right now in return proceedings. I also want a rebate of return shipping costs and will let you know if all goes as it should."
4,Good supplement for general genetics course,This was a good reference for both my general genetics and microbiology courses. Explains molecular genetics concepts and methods very well. I would recommend this book.
2,Not a tutorial book for beginners,"That's right. If you are looking for step by step learning in this text, forget it. What the author does is present several game models on the CD. You examine the game and the code. He does some explanation at a high level of what the code does. There is some basic treatment of explaining what function, variable, and other programming elements are. But not enough for a novis. This may be a good reference text that shows project examples, but it is far from a solid instructional work. If you learn from picking apart examples, then this book is for you. If you want step-by-step explanation with support, then I can not recommend this book."
1,dont buy,don't buy poor quality. wast of money. after first cook inside looks dark mark.no NSS sign. care full while buy
1,Leaker Cooker,"I wasnt very happy with the size of the product but then that was my fault in ordering this 2 litre cooker. The worse part is it just leaks water and whatever you have put inside if the water level is more than 1/4 of the volume of the cooker, ie, 500 ml water. So, basically i cannot cook for more than 1 person in this and whenever i tried to, it took me hours of refilling water and cooking to finally end up with non-edible food with a lot of waste and a lot of cleaning to do. I have tried adjusting the whistle and the rubber band but nothing works.No Hawkins for me anymore."
4,Liked it,"I liked it, was different. A little chezzy but I might watch it again some time not likely lol."
3,A good looking movie,"So... it's corny. The opening scene sort of sets the tone. I am a Vin Diesel fan though, so I give it plenty of leeway. There are parts of the movie that seem really solid and thought out, but there are others that fail in a way that the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies fail. They spend a little too much time with the religious parody. Anyhow, if you haven't seen it and you're sci fi fan, you should probably watch it. I've heard you should definitely get the directors cut. I haven't seen the non-directors cut, but I heard it was horrible."
1,Garbage,Worst movie I've seen in a while. After it was over I rewound back to parts earlier in the movie that might explain something but nope. Just complete garbage. What's the deal with the Noelites? Think we could get that developed just a *bit* more?!?! I do think Vin Diesel deserves to be in a good movie again some day.
5,Army Leadership,"This book was very good; I actually read it as a companion piece to ""The US Army Leadership Field Manual,"" and BE-KNOW-DO clarified several of the issues hightlighted in the first manual. I enjoyed reading this book!"
4,"Wow, this is BORING.","Although this book is required reading, not only for ARMY OCS, but also for other applications, it is quite possibly the most BORING read ever.While the information is quite valid *and* genius, basically the ARMY's system on leadership, it is just plain boring... Sorry, it's the truth.For the price, the information is golden. In fact, even if the price were higher it would still be worth what you pay. But even still, this was a painful 171 pages to read!!BUY IT. READ IT. GET IT OVER WITH...! :)"
1,don't buy this dvd,"this movie is just the last 3 episodes of one of the seasons of degrassi, the ones with kevin smith in them. nothing really exciting about it at all. you can make your own movie by watching the 3 episodes right in order."
4,Kevin Smithy,More Degrassi-ish than Jay & Silent Bob-ish. Jason Mews and Kevin Smith guest stared on three episodes of Degrassi. This is them.
1,I've been mislead,"Judging by the product description and pictures, I was expecting to get the Delta Dart with the sheath. I actually ordered two of them. What I got was a pair of empty sheathes. Not only that, but these empty sheathes cost almost as much as the dart/sheath combo is supposed to. The item's description and images should be changed to emphasize that this is only the sheath."
4,Graham's Review,"If you LOVE House music, this CD is an Excellent one to buy and cruise too! If you don't like House music, you will after you buy this CD. Buy and ENJOY!"
2,Works great but smells awful,There is a smell from the inside that makes my watch and the unit smell awful.
3,"Only good for one night, maybe two","Got this for our basset hound for Halloween and barely stayed on him. Was sliding off all night and by the end, was not even usable. We just through it away. If you are only wanting to use this for a single night, I think you are ok but beyond that the materials are just way to cheap to confidently say you will be able to continue using it. Based on quality, I would give it a 1,, based on the cuteness factor and not expecting more than a nights use, I give it a five. So, on average, 3 stars."
2,Only Buy if You Can Sew,"This is the cutest dog costume ever. That said... Everyone's comments about the poor quality of the costumer were dead-on. For 10 bucks or so, just know that your dog probably won't get more than one wear out of this costume. Also, buy a size larger than you think you need. Those velcro straps are sooo tiny. I'm no expert sewer but I managed to add to the straps and make them longer. Also, I reinforced the straps a bit.It's a cute costume.. just be prepared to do a little sewing once you get it."
1,Terrible construction,"The Velco strap broke the very first time we put it on our dog. We rigged it and by the time we got home from walking about 1/2 block, another area had broken and the costume was falling off. This was TERRIBLY made. I would not recommend."
3,A family about to go down in flames,"This novel is about the disintegration of a family, a fairly disfunctional one at that. The father is a weak man and the oldest son hates him for that; the mother sees only the good in everything; the other three children try to hold things together. When I first read this when it first came out, I was very moved by it. Reading it a second time now I find much of the action just wasted energy. The book is poignant and sad in spots, but just too crazy and chaotic for me now."
2,Disappointing Kindle Edition,"I have this book on hard cover and it is, as so many others have written, one of the most outstanding books in my library. However, when I bought the version for Kindle on iPad I found that the electronic version lacks the months and days that accompany the meditations. Maybe it works fine on Kindle by Amazon. But on my iPad it is virtually useless."
