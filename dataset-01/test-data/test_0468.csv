4,"Good headphones, but mine have a small problem","First I must say that when this item works, it works well. However I am currently having an issue with the base turning off for a moment and then coming back on. It's more of an annoyance than anything. It's really odd, someone on TV will be in the middle of a sentence and the base will simply ""go out"" and then immediately come back on within 2/3 seconds. Other than that it works great, the sound quality is not the most robust I've ever heard but certainly the best from any wireless headphones I've ever used.On a side note many people complain of a hiss, but I found by turning up my source the hiss was eliminated even when there is silence from the source.Overall a very good product and I'm still looking into the power issue."
1,A shockingly bad design...,"I read the positive reviews for this product and made my purchase based on those reviews. But this is a poorly designed product. The overall look and feel of it is fine, but there is an ""auto-shutoff"" feature that is incredibly annoying. I use this product at my computer, and if the sound turns off for a minute (or if the sound becomes low, like you've turned down the volume so that the music is playing softly) the transmitter automatically turns off and you're greeted with a din of static into your ears at full volume. There appears to be no away around this. And, as others commented on, there is constantly a hiss in the background. Was this product ever tested? And what philistine thought the auto shut-off feature was a good idea? Not worth your money. If I had to buy again, I'd get one with cables."
4,"Good product, BUT","I gave the headphones 4 stars because they are exactly what I wanted for reception and range, BUT I seem to have received an item that was previously returned and had been broken. I didn't return the headphones because I had waited 3 weeks before the package arrived and didn't want to suffer the wait again. I had to resort to using super glue to stabilize a dangling ear piece. I like the headphones, just terribly disappointed in amazon for shipping out a previously returned item without having inspected it for damages."
1,Sennheiser RS120,"I should have focused more on the negative reviews for this product.I just could not make these headphones work properly. Between the ever-present staticand the inability to ever get a clear signal (from 10 feet)they made me crazy.I also didn't care much for the fit, not that it really mattered because the sound was intolerable.Sent them back to Amazon and I'll keep looking."
3,Sendheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones,"The sound quality and reception are great. Our condo is relatively small, but the reception at the very back of the place is just as good as when sitting near the TV that's at the very front. I love the radio recharging feature. No need to plug anything in to recharge the battery when not it use. Just place the headphones on the broadcast unit's cradle, and the remote charging light comes on.My complaint is the human engineering. The headset fits fine when you keep your head up, but if you lean forward it tends to want to slide off of your head and fall to the floor. You have to remember not to move to far out of the perpendicular when wearing them"
3,Okay for TV but not for music,I've used these for a few weeks now and I have to say that I wasn't impressed. These work all right with TV but the sound is not too great. With music these sound pretty bad compared to any wired ones.The interference easily happens with these headphones and static is also pretty commonly heard over them. Battery life is decent.
1,lousy quality control,I order and then had to send back and reorder a 2nd which i am sening back after 3 days different problem each time it seems like it is just like most stuff made in china u r lucky if it works for a week I really would like to find one that is good quality but I assure u this is not
2,Good service by distributor but bad product,I was impressed by the customer service but the product was not so good. The reception was terrible and the did not service its purpose for design. The charging cradle is misleading because it doesn't really charge. The headset requires batteries and the cradle only holds the headset.
4,Auto turn off,"I just timed the auto turn off function, it doesn't kick in until it reached 3 minutes of idle time...For the reviewers complaining about the auto turn off:If your gonna do something thats gonna take longer than 3 minutes, pause whatever you're listening to and turn off your headphones. When you're done doing what you have to do, turn what ever your listening to into play and turn your headphones back on.This product is real cheap for a wireless headphones with great range. really worth the money"
4,SERVES ITS PURPOSE,"SOUND COULD BE BETTER BUT ITS WORTH THE PRICE, I PURCHASED IT SO I DONT KEEP THE TV TO LOUD & WAKE MY WIFE"
2,RS130 didn't last,"RS130 quit working at 2 years and 2 months on a 2 year warranty. No help from Sennheiser for several reasons; 2months out of warranty, the RS130 was discontinued, and there are no replacements. While it worked I enjoyed watching TV in peace, hence 2 stars. The lack of service and inability to offer a replacement requires me not to recommend this product or Sennheiser."
2,Worked OK but stopped working after 5 months.,Worked OK but stopped working after 5 months. I attached the headphones to my TV so my poor hearing would not cause problems for others. Used them intermittently every day. For no reason transmitter/charging station stopped working. Can't recomend these wireless headphones.
4,Almost perfect for wireless headphones,"I am very satisfied with these headphones. I first saw these at Fry's for a $120.00. I went home, found them on Amazon, read the reviews and purchased them for only 69.99! What a savings. Yes, you do hear a little hiss, but not more than you would expect for a wireless device. If you are using them to watch television, then you won't even notice the hiss. I wish that the headphones would stay on my head a little better. If I'm washing the dishes and look down, the headphones tend to want to fall off. Not that big of a deal, but I do wish they were a little tighter on my head. I highly recommend them to anyone wishing to use these for watching television."
3,3 Star Headphones,"I am glad I bought the refurbished one's and did not pay $100.00 for these.The sound quality is good, but not great. They are uncomfortable and don'tfit well. They will fall off if you bend over. There is a hiss in the soundif you fine tune them for more volume. I do like the fact that the batteries are rechargeable. I do like the charging cradle. Like I said I am glad I only paid $36.00 for them. If I had paid $100.00 I would have been ripped off."
2,I don't like them,These headphones are not as clear as ones I previously owned. You have to be careful about turning your head or you lose the signal. I would not purchase them again
1,Terrible quality,"Worked fine for about two months, then the unit wouldn't turn on anymore. The red charging light would come on as normal while the headphones were charging, but when I put them on and increased the TV volume to activate the on/off green indicator light on the transmitter base, it just wouldn't come on. Just static through the headphones.I then unplugged the transmitter for 30 seconds, removed the batteries, reinserted them as the troubleshooting instructions say to do and still nothing. Turning the tuning wheel and switching to any of the three channels on the transmitter base didn't seem to help, either.Needless to say, this product is going back."
2,Expensive doesn't mean quality,"I have had other wireless head phones in the past and on a scale of one to 10, I would rate these a 5. These are too bulky and uncomfortable. Also they slide off your head when you happen to look down. It would be a better product if the ear cups were hollowed out. The band across the top of your head is very uncomfortable. You can solve that by wearing a baseball cap but who wants to do that. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good. I ended up buying a less expensive set of headphones for 37$. They are very comfortable and have very good sound quality.You can't beat the price and quality of Audio Unlimited."
4,Sennheiser head phones,"When I first got the item it worked great. A few days later I was not getting sound in the right head phone. I tried using the tuning wheel on the head phone which seems to adjust for this situation, but it was way too sensitive. After several tries at other things, I did something a little weird. I went to the back of my TV and switched the audio input jacks. I put the the Sennheiser red jack into the TV's white input and the Sennheiser black jack into the TV's red input. Now it works great. Go figure !!!!!!!!!!I do especially love that this device works on radio waves. Lets me walk all over the house and even outside and still hear my show this is great."
1,Shoddy workmanship,I had to return the headphones same day I received because: (1) the green light would not light up power up; (2) the headphones would not seat snugly but rock on the transmitter-charger so could not establish contact with the base unless pushed down and hold while charging! Poor workmanship or inspection. I wouldn't buy Sennheiser products again.Piyush
5,Wireless headphones,"These were recomended by a friend and he was dead on ! I hooked base to T.V. and charged batteries as soon as I got set. Now I can watch T.V. while my wife is sleeping with the sound turned way down so it doesn""t disturb her but with the volume turned up in the head set so I can hear. Even works if other background noise is loud such as a vaccumn cleaner !"
4,Sounds pretty good.,"I don't use it that much, but girls seem to like it. They use to listen to music while moving about the house, or doing chores. Sounds fine to me, but not top of the line, but i didnt pay that much. Seems the price has went up. Would'nt pay much more than 50. Would buy again."
1,Won't stay on head.,"I've had luck with other Sennheiser headphones (in particular, I love the wired HD 555 headphones), but these wireless ones are just awful.There is a hiss on all channels, even at close range, and in a home with no other interference.Worse, though, is the fact that they won't stay on my head! The flat ear pieces lay flat, rather than hooking around the ears, so they just slide off your ears when you tilt your head forward or back. And the bar that rests on the top of your head is horrible also... even on it's tightest setting it is loose on a medium-sized head, and the padding provides no friction. These headphones really want to slide off my head. Definitely returning them."
3,"good sound, poor reception","These FM wireless stereo headphones suffer from poor reception; there is almost always a hiss. The closer to the transmitter the less the hiss. Within the house they work fine unless I am moving around. Being in one place with minimal movement gives best reception. Outside the house reception deteriorates rapidly.Sound quality is good and the controls are easy to locate and operate with the headphones on. For $70, these are good value.I found the headphones loose-fitting, and need to use a headband to keep them on my head when I move. But then I have a small head.I originally tried headphones using Bluetooth, but the range was too limited at 30 feet. If I could find Bluetooth technology with a longer range, they would be my choice."
2,awful recption,"This worked pretty well when used about a foot from my computer, but when I use it with the TV, about 8ft away, the reception is awful. We have tried rescanning many times and no change. Constant whirring sound and hiss. Unusable."
2,poor service,"I paid and received a dead eraphphone on 9/21/2010, I then ship it back for an exchangeaccording to the procedure on 10/7/2010. So far, I have received nothing yet ! What a poor service !"
4,Price is Right,"We bought these to use in bed so the kids can't hear our tv, and they work well for us. We only sit about 8 feet from the tv, but my dad walked almost a block down the street, and could still hear the tv. That's crazy far. We have two sets, and use both cradles for charging, but only one is hooked up to the tv, and still provides the signal for both headsets. I'm sure there are better sets out there, but for our needs, and for the price, these are perfect."
2,Don't buy these!,"DON'T BUY THESE! The connection is so catchy! I feel like I can never catch a break with these headphones. One minute I'll be listening fine and the next the connection goes out and the green light goes out too. I didn't change anything and these would just stop working!!! I didn't use them for like a week once, and the green light stayed on (meaning they had connection to my TV) and when I went to use them again the green light went off. Spend a little more and buy a better pair, you won't regret it. Sending these back asap."
1,bad product,"Not working, noise sound only, I try many time but nothing operation, can not use it. Now I'm so far to take to warranty. So bad product, never buy this !"
4,Sennheiser rs120,The Sennheiser rs120 work great for watching tv at the volume you want to listen at. They have really clear sound and are comfortable to wear
5,Sennheiser RS 120 -- Fantastic Product,"I bought this product and liked it so much I bought another. The wireless range is very good, even through walls and floors. I am also impressed by how long the rechargeable batteries hold their charge. Additional headsets are available, but if you own two as I do, you can use both on the same transmitter. I may even buy a third set!Amazon, as usual, had a good price and fast shipping."
4,Check TV output !,I read many complaints about these headphones and was about to return them in frustration (because I was unable to make them work) when my son-in-law tried plugging them into my radio where they did work. He then found my tv output needed to be adjusted! It was NOT the fault of the headphones after all. They are actually very good. Give them a chance! ro
4,Works as advertised,"My wife is hearing impaired and uses headphones to listen to TV, eliminating the need to turn the volume up loud. Sennheiser has been a constant in our home. We have tried other headphones over the years, but keep returning to Seenheiser."
4,Good wireless headphones,"Good sound quality!!Distance capability not as far as claimed. Well made product, easy to use, needs very little setup"
4,Not for a quiet office.,"I got these for the office. I wanted wireless ones as chords and armchairs are a dangerous mix. I like them, but I still wish I went for the 130 or 140's, as they seem to have more sound isolation.Pros:They are very comfortable, easy to use, low maintenance. Sound decent, clear.Cons:They bleed a lot of sound (poor sound isolation), so if you work in a quiet office, everyone will be listening with you. Not a lot of bass, especially for large headphones.Summary:Absolutely worth the $60 I paid for them. Not ideal for quiet places or audiophiles. Spend the extra money."
5,best gift ever,"I gave these to my husband as a gift for Christmas. He says they are the best gift he has ever received. We live in a very small house with three small children, so hearing the tv was not possible. The first show he watched wearing them, he said it was the first time he was able to hear what the people were saying. The kids can be two feet away tearing down the house and he sits in blissful peace smiling like an idiot. The quality seems to be good, love the charging system. My father also has these, my mother loves them, she doesn't have to listen to what he is watching in the basement anymore. I was amazed at the sounds I have been missing in movies. I don't know if these are the best sound quality out there, but for our purpose, we LOVE them."
4,manual,"You hearing headphones are great except that there is no instructions as to use them along with the the sender that sends the sounds, there is three selections at the bottom of the sender. They work very well as I'm extremely hard of hearing."
3,Unreliable,"When they work they are great. I have had the same problem as other purchasers where the on/off light will just not come on and you lose the signal. I nearly packed the headphones up to return them and gave them ONE LAST TRY lol and after unplugging EVERYTHING connected to the headphones (including taking out the batteries) the unit finally came back on and they worked great again. I can have the TV on soft mute so husband doesn't have to listen to my programs and can adjust the volume fine to my own comfort. My hearing is less than husbands so he can have TV at a volume that is comfortable to him and I can wear headphones and turn the volume up. If I keep having the same trouble I will return them. So my final thoughts are, if I had read the negative reviews first I probably wouldn't have purchased these."
4,Sennheiser Headphones RS120,"I'd buy it again without hesitation, fantastic improvement in Tv and Movie watching, no need for sub-titles anymore"
3,I would expect much better from such famous brand,"Advantages:- Simple and clear design, simple tuning, sound amazing and smooth.- Supported range - impressive indeed.Disadvantages:- There is no universal charger, which is outrages nowadays. This is so obvious default for all home electronic and gadgets, that I was deeply disappointed.- Both, the volume and tuning scrolling buttons are very small and reside on the same side of the headphone, one under another. Any try of volume adjustment requires full person attention and coordination.- When TV is turned off, the switched-on headphones may generate heavy radio noise. Switch OFF/ON may fix the problem. Or may not..."
4,bob's your uncle,"my father loves his british programs. unfortunately, they're not subtitled because he can never understand a word they say because he can't hear a certain tone in their voices. a hearing aid is out of the question so as a result he watches tv with the volume at full max. whenever i'm in the house i wear earplugs. it's really not funny. i bought these with my fingers crossed. it was a snap to set up and i waited until sunday night to surprise him when his shows came on. he called me up on monday to actually thank me. his words were, ""i understood everything they said, but most of all i was able to relax and enjoy the shows."" his happiness was my happiness."
2,Sounds great when it works..,"This headphone probably sounds the best in all wireless headphones I have tried. The only problem is, it didn't work just when I needed it to. The base intermittenly stopped transmitting (green light is off), and I have a useless piece of junk. In the last 28 days, it has happened about 3 times. I tried everything from unplugging it to retuning the frequency with no success. Then the next day, it worked all of a sudden. So, it is going back to Amazon today."
3,Would give 2.5 stars,"After reading all the glowing reviews, perhaps I had my hopes set a little too high. The ""hiss"" is present even at best possible reception. 'Acceptable' reception radius is somewhere around 40 feet, but works best at 20ft and under. I'm guessing the quality of wireless technology still hasn't caught up to its advertising. Even though it will improve in the coming years, I have a feeling I'll be looking back at this headset as if it were a beta from the '80s (or a VCR from the '90s)."
5,Better Hearing,"This is a wonderful aid to better hearing of TV without a mess of wires and blaring audio. Neat , attractive stand and comfortable earpieces make it a must for anyone hard of hearing. Great value!"
3,I can hear !,"I think my wife enjoys these more than I do because now the TV isnt up so loud ! They are ok, once in a while with out warning the power light turns off and I get an ear full of static but over all I am enjoying them."
2,Not so good,"These headphones may be OK for some people, but I find them to be uncomfortable and unreliable. I bought them for use with a bedroom TV set. They hiss like crazy, and the sound cuts out occasionally causing REALLY LOUD hissing while you scramble to turn down the volume and re-tune to the channel. After reading the return policy on these from antononline (which states that 99%of the time the item is not defective), I am not even going to try returning them. I will just chalk this up to a bad purchasing decision on my part."
4,Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones,"Works perfectly for watching TV, just take it of the charging stand and switch on TV. Ear muffs ( on the ear) and head band are not very comfortable. Sound quality and WiFi range are resonable."
4,Headphones,"I have found these headphone to work very well, the controls are easy to use. Due to the size they are bulky on the head and tend to fall off if you bend over. The reception and sound quality is good. Would recommend to a friend."
4,wireless headset is well worth money,The Senneiser wireless headpones are well worth the money but it's a good thing they have pictures because the instructions leave a lot to be desired...
4,It's okay for the price.,"I like these earphones because they are cordless, and it's so easy to recharge them because of the base they sit on. I have yet for them to die out. I give it 4 stars for the following reasons; The sound quality could be better. Depending on how you adjust the recpetion there is alot of white noise in the background, or if it's ajusted then the volume is not as good. There have been times when other people's phone conversations are picked up, and when this happens you will have to unplug the base, turn off the headset to reset it."
1,Not a Good Choice,"After endless searching for a good set of wireless headphones - I read decent reviews so I gave them a try. During the first use, they would lose power for no reason. . .they were a Christmas present for my Husband, and they are going back."
1,Sennheiser RS120 Over-Ear 900MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging,"Operated per your instructions, but the unit just quite its operation. Have not used in a long time. I am a Homebound individual, thus getting it out to be repaired (if possible) is a difficult situation for me."
2,"Good sound, but cheesy construction","The sound quality is very good, and its range is excellent. However the construction and durability is way below average. I am afraid that if I don't handle it gently, it will break in my hands. After awhile, the elastic head band starts to widen and begin to slip off my head."
1,Disappointing reception,"Seems like the reviews on Amazon for this product fall in two categories - 5 star love-fests and 1-star complaints of reception. I'm afraid this review falls into the latter category. I'm using these headphones literally 8 feet from the receiver, and I hear distortion when I turn my head or just when something in the universe shifts and causes these headphones to make a high pitched noise. Also, you have to get them balanced PERFECTLY on the cradle to charge - otherwise the little charging light goes out.The name implies German quality, but these are Made in China, and seem very cheap and poorly engineered. Back to Amazon they go..."
1,"Constant hiss, broke quickly","Despite the largely good reviews, these headphones are awful. There is a constant, distracting hiss, and no amount of fiddling with the tuning dial helps, it only makes it worse. It is the same on all three channels and with different input devices. And a range of over 300 feet? Try 20 feet. The only way to be happy with these headphones is to keep your expectations very low.I originally forgot to mention the extremely loud static when the headphones don't find, or lose, a sound signal. Ouch!News update. The left channel stopped working after four months. Complete junk."
2,Outstanding - when they work,"I read the reviews and thought there were some mental midgets out there trying to use them. They were correct, I was incorrect.The headphones are comfortable and provide great sound. I have poor hearing and was amazed at how much more I could hear with these. They worked perfectly for a day or so then became a real PITA! I turn them on and all is perfect for 1 to 10 minutes. Then the power light goes off and I get nothing but static through the speakers. The only way I can correct this is by unplugging the headphones from my receiver, wait a moment for the power light to come back on then plug them back in. I have tried everything imaginable to isolate the cause of this problem but have been unable to find anything. I have a background in electronics design and repair but this has me stumped. They are being sent back."
5,Great Headphones,"This item is a great gift and well worth the price. I bought because a friend recommended. The sound is great, I even ordered a spare set just to have for use with a second TV."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT,"I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW THESE THINGS WORKED SO I BORROWED A DIFFERENT BRAND AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE,THEY WERE CALLED TV EARS. THE RECEPTION RANGE WAS HORRIBLE, I COULDN'T EVEN GO INTO MY KITCHEN WITHOUT STATIC, AND I HAVE A SMALL HOUSE. SO I SHOPPED AROUND ON LINE AND FOUND THESE. I READ THE REVIEWS AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD SO I GAVE THEM A TRY. THEY ARE GREAT. I HAVE BEEN USING THEM FOR 3 MONTHS NOW AND THEY HAVE MADE MY EVENING TV WATCHING SO NICE. I WENT OUTSIDE AND WALKED ALL AROUND THE HOUSE WITH THEM AND THE RECEPTION WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THEM IS THAT I WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALLER AND FIT A LITTLE MORE SNUG ON MY HEAD, OTHER WISE THEY ARE GREAT AND EVERONE GETS A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP. THEY WERE ON SALE ALSO FOR A GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECCOMEND THESE TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR TV."
1,Be Wary of Rebate,"The product works fine however in the offer was a set of free CX 300s. Be very careful you send the correct bar code. I apparently sent the wrong one, threw away the box and am now out of luck on the freebie. The company that handles this for Sennheiser has no contact capability for customers."
2,My TV bought last year did not have the proper connection,The headphones worked with an older TV in the spare bedroom but my newer TV in the living room did not have the proper connections for this device.
4,My opinion of the Sennheiser RS120 926 Wireless Headphones,"After reading other reviews and the product info, these headphones live up to their claim. We have the same problem as many couples, my wife wanted the TV loud and I couldn't stand it that loud. This really has made the experience of watching TV a lot better. I can have the volume lower where I like it and she's enjoying her own world with the headphones. If I'm reading or on the computer I can even turn the TV volume off and she can have it any level she wants. I've enjoyed using them too, great for movies with special effects. I can't compare these to other brands but will tell you they are heads above the 'TV Ears'. I give them a thumbs up."
2,Not What I Expected,I purchased the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones RS120 926 for my husband who has a minor hearing problem. I was very dissappointed in the quality of the product and the headphones which were very uncomfortable and difficult to adjust the volumn. Maybe someone will have better luck than my husband!
1,Very disappointed,"Unfortunately this item did not work out for us. I was hoping that we would be able to use the headset with our TV so that we could turn down the volumn to save my hearing! All we got was static! My boyfried uses headset at the movies all of the time now and loves it. I thought it would be the perfect solution to our problems at home. To our disappointment, that is not the case at all."
4,Good Headphones,I like the headphones. I replaced the on ear cushions with around ear cushions. they are much more comfortable for me.
2,Don't like the Hissssss,Just received my wireless headphones. Pretty easy to install however..........the background hisssss is pretty annoying. I will probably return and upgrade to a $150 set and hopefully get rid of the Hisssss.Update: Try turning your TV volume up (maybe 50%) then lowering the headphone volume. This significantly reduced the hisss. I'm going to change my rating to 3 stars. Maybe I will keep these headphones. Not bad for the price.
3,Product Issues,I purchased this product for my father who is hard of hearing and turns the TV up loud enough for him to hear but disturbing everyone in the household. It worked WONDERFULLY at first and then we started having reception issues. It stopped working and I sent it back to the manufacturer. The time for repair took too long and I could never reach anyone at the company. I finally received a replacement pair because they could not fix the original pair. I will see how these work.
1,Terrible Design!,"Have bought and returned three of these Senn. RS120 to Fry's. The cubby hole in the rear, where one is supposed to insert the AC plug is sooo small it's almost impossible to put human fingers in there to insert the plug. After I tried and two of Fry's techs tried, finally a thin, young lady was able to insert the AC jack. Guess what! No power, no lights, nothing - ON ALL THREE MODELS!Don't bother with these RS120. It is a very bad, mal functioning design that just plain doesn't work. At $100 there are much better choices."
3,Not up to Sennheiser quality,"The unit Sounds fine, and that is why I rated it ""OK"", but the ear cups are not particularly comfortable, and the foam pads are barely attached and come loose quite easily. I had higher hopes for a unit in this price rangeCons:If you want a fit and finish that is quality, leather, well padded, comfortable unit, this is not it.Pros:If you want a sound that is clear, easy to use, and decent on the batter life, this is a unit to consider."
1,Poor connectivity,"We have tried two different new headphones and neither would continue to transmit after 10 minutes of usage. I would not recommend these headphones to anyone. They were a gift and the second time through, we even tried them on multiple television sets to see if that was the problem. I would like my money back."
1,Don't Buy,This sucks. Don't buy it. NOt much more to say. Better off buying anything else. Anything at all; its terrible
3,tv head phones,"I had a few questions on the item, the questions were answered in an excellant manner."
4,Ok but not perfect.,"Headphones are a bit cumbersome and they do not fit tight over the ears. Sound quality is pretty good, but there is some hissing and static. This can usually be eased by changing your location a little, although it never goes away completely. Overall, I am happy I purchased this product, but wish I had shopped around a little more and tried others. The reception distance is very good. I have no problem hearing the tv from any room in my apartment when wearing the headphones. As stated before, the biggest drawback for me is the bulkiness of the head set."
3,Sennheiser RS 120,"These have pretty good sound considering the price BUT since they sit on the ear, not over the ear, they are very uncomfortable if you're trying to deal with glasses and/or hearing aids. Also, they can't be used in the same area with some of the other Sennheiser (RS 130 for one) because although each headset was connected to a different computer, we could not each listen to different things due to bleedthrough? (whatever you want to call it). I was trying to listen to music, hubby a product review, and we both heard the other's sound in the background. This was coming though the headsets, not because either one of us had the volume up. Changing the channel on the heaphones and bases did not correct this. One set of headphones' transmitter was set on '1' and one on '3'."
2,Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones,"The headphones are not that great, as the volume is low and does not give a good music experience. I was expecting something good from Sennheiser, but these are very average."
4,THESE HEADPHONES ROCK!,"After wrestling with the tough decision of which headphones to purchase, I settled on these. I love them! I use them with my stereo, and I haven't had any problem with hissing in the background. There is a dial right on the headphone to adjust the reception to get clear sound. I can walk all over my house and not lose my music. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is (as another reviewer pointed out) the headphones--although very comfortable---come off my head when looking downward. Overall I am very pleased with these wireless headphones!"
3,OK for TV watching,"These headphones are OK, but not the most comfortable ones that I have had. If I move about the room while listening, in the same room where the transmitter is located, I pass through places where the signal drops out. OK for sitting and watching TV as I just need to move a short distance, but annoying if you want to move about the room while listening because you go through these signal nulls."
2,The Dynamic Volume Leveling has to go.,"I really only have one complaint about these headphones. The sound quality is good, the comfort is good - I wear them 8 hours each day, and the charge always lasts the entire day.My problem is that I listen to music with a lot of dynamic range, which wreaks havoc with the dynamic audio leveling. For example, during a quiet part of a song, there may be a sudden crescendo, which is immediately clamped down to the level of the quiet section, and continues so for several seconds while attenuating to the new level.While this might not matter for some music or listening habits, this is not for music with any dynamics.I should have researched the product a little more closely. Now, I'm on the quest of another set of headphones that sound good and will not get tangled under the legs of my chair."
4,These are great!,"I've been wearing these on and off all day. They're wonderful for listening to the music I've added to iTunes but just haven't had a chance to listen to in the past, since I can be anywhere in the house while listening. My son can work right next to me and listen to his music as I preview music I'm considering adding to my music library, and he doesn't have to hear it. I'm very pleased with these headphones.The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that they're not as comfortable as I'd like. Kind of heavy on my little head! Love how easily they charge though! That's terrific. I recommend these."
2,Flimsy - Have to use a clip to charge it to cradle,When you put the headset on to charge it is lopsided and I need to use a clip to hold it. The sound is great and I will eventually send it back as for the price I paid I should not have to put up with clipping it on to cradle.
3,"Not working after 1,5 years, warranty useless","I bought this model almost 2 years ago. It worked fine, pretty comfortable on the head, though we had to change frequencies sometimes. The batteries lasted all this time, but gradually the volume of sound had to be increased at the source (TV). Headphones stopped working abruptly, only horrible noise and interference were heard. I changed the batteries as I thought this was the reason, but it did not help. Checked the company website for warranty info, there is a minimum $35 evaluation charge. I would rather buy a new set which costs $65 now. I expected more from this company, honestly, where is the famous german quality? Product made in China however."
3,works well enough,"I got this to use during working out on an elliptical machine so I could watch TV without disturbing the rest of the house. It works but the sound quality is less than what I had expected. Could be that wireless is just not as good as ""wired""."
4,Good Bang for the Buck,"I got these to sit on my desk at work because I work in cubicle land and I find noise to be very distracting. I actually don't use them as often as I thought I would, but it's not because there's anything wrong with the headphones. They work quite well.The sound quality is very good, though there is occasionally some static that has to be dealt with by moving the base a little. I'm typically very annoyed by these sorts of things, but the issue is so minor and infrequent with these headphones that I'm not bothered by it at all.I've had these for two years or so and the betteries still seem to hold a charge very well. I'd buy these headphones again."
3,not for music lovers,"I bought these headphones for listening to music around the house. The base response is so poor they are realy only good for watching tv. The headphones work fine, the charging system works well, the broadcast range is very good. However, the sound quality and dynamic response is nothing to brag about. If your intention is to watch tv or a movie then I would say this is a good buy. If you are looking for a good acuostical experience, I would say look elsewhere."
3,Lasted about 1.5 years,"This is an addendum to a previous glowing review (at least I think I reviewed it previously... it would have been glowing, in any case). Sound quality is excellent, fit is tolerable, and it's just wonderful to be able to hear complex dialogue, etc. But as time went on, recharging became less and less reliable, and now it has absolutely given up the ghost. At first I could rejuvenate the recharging by gentle abrasion of the recharging surfaces, but it no longer works. I bought these in January, 2007, so they lasted about 1.5 years. I miss them a lot and often think, ""I need my headphones,"" only to remember that they don't work anymore! Pretty expensive for such a limited time. Consider yourself warned."
3,Multiple in one household?,Does anyone know if I can have 2 of these running off different audio sources in one house at the same time? Is there a channel adjustment or something? Anyone tried this?
1,Product did not work!,I tried for several hours on two TVs following all the directions and still static was all I could get out of the headphones. I sent them back!
2,"When these headphones are on, the TV sound is STILL on","My entire reason for purchasing the Sennheiser RS120 headphones was to be able to watch and listen to TV while my wife was in the same room and did not want to hear TV sound. After connecting these headphones, I found that sound continues to come from the TV AS WELL AS through the headphones. Customer Service from Sennheiser (after several futile tries to get a rep on the phone) told me that the headphones are not designed to cut off the sound from the TV; I wondered why anyone would want BOTH TV sound and headphone sound at the same time...to me, this makes no sense.So, for those of you who may be looking for wireless headphones to use while watching TV while your spouse/partner is in the same room/area and is trying to read or sleep, these are NOT for you. My 2 star rating is because the sound quality is quite good and the unit is comfortable."
1,No Power Cable?!,Got this for my girlfriend for christmas. When she opened it it didn't have a Power Cable. I am very unhappy about that. How can you ship something without a power cable?
3,Great Sound - Slips off Head,"Good wireless headphones with great sound. The replaceable ear pads can be both good and bad. Since they are flat they do not surround the ear and therefore tend to slip off your head with any movement. O K if you are just sitting, but not good if moving around and doing any bending over or tipping of the head. For this reason I will be returning."
2,"Hisses, Clicks, and Auto Shut Off","Unfortunately I'll be returning these headphones. They seem to work at my loft but when I brought them to the office there is a constant fast clicking that present on all channels and frequencies. Most noticeable during quiet songs or spoken word. The auto shut off is really annoying. If I pause a song for more than 5 or 10 minutes the headphones blast static into my ears. Then starting up a song takes them a 1 to 2 seconds to stop the static and start the music, clicking and all."
2,Bad design -,"The RS120 has great sound but ear pieces are not parallel with each other and angle out towards the back of the head. Tilt your head down and the headphone falls off. I bet I've dropped mine 200 times in the year I've owned them. However, this does prove they're well built because they still work after all those drops."
3,Manual off switch?,"Sound quality is good, but I was really unhappy with the manual on/off switch (other wireless headphones I've had switch on and off when placed on your head).Charging method of hanging the headphones on a rack mounted on the base means it takes up quite a bit of room.Could have been done better."
2,Will work differently in different environments.,"Product had too much interference in my apartment when I got about 50 ft away. Also, and this is a personal reaction, I found the phones heavy and bulky. I returned them."
3,Marginally satisfactory,"Every three minutes the sound cuts out and there is a blaxt of static. Totally unsatisfactory performance notwithstanding the price. There is no way to contact the manufacturer to deal with the problem. Others have mentioned the problem and it is surprising the company continues to market the product in the circumstances. The headphones are very difficult to tune, the on/off switch is superfulous and the audio jack is too short for some applications. All in all a so-so product.Ron Gunning"
1,Great in theory. Wish it were better in practice,"While this headset is made by a highly rated manufacturer, the quality of the product is less than stellar. They are of a high quality build, but operationally deficient.We had a difficult time tuning the headset with my TV, which was the only reason I bought it. The transmitter was within 6' of the headset, but that made no difference. Got a lot of Ham Radio interference and they just plain didn't work for me.Too bad."
2,Poor sound quality,"Could not get good sound quality, regardless of settings. Even when staying within 15 feet of the transmitter."
3,Suggestion,"The Sennheiser RS120 is of limitted use to me for the following reason (not its fault): When I plug the RS120 into the audio output of my TV, it mutes the TV speakers. I was hoping to be able to listen via the RS120 Earphones while other people in the room be able to listen normally via the TV peakers.I do not know how to stop the muting. The issue is of course with the TV not the Sennheiser.If you have a solution, please inform me.Thanks,Pnina"
4,well worth your money,"After buying and using seveeral different and more expensive headphones, I have found these wireles headphones perform as advertised and seems to be wortha a lot more than expected. Thanks for offering aquality produvt at a reasonable price."
4,wireless audio,The product provides outstanding audio quality with impressive range and great battery life (longer than 5 hours of continuous use.) It is far superior to its wired audio equipment counterparts. I found no wired product in this price range with comparable quality.Ray
3,Comfy but not top notch,They are very comfortable but the TV still needs to be on at a medium level for them to work. We also have TV ears and they are not as comfortable but there doesn't have to be any sound coming from the TV in order to hear perfectly. TV ears are more expensive. I guess it depends on your individual priorities.
2,Lot's of interference,"These headphones are really great, when they are working. They charge and hold that charge for a long time, but they are very prone to inference and changing the channel only helps temporarily. I was very disappointed in these headphones and would not recommend them."
3,lets my girl sleep,It sound verily well maybe A little static and fits well works good in other rooms and very easy to charge .
2,Super Leaky,"These are comfortable, have a reasonable sound quality for the price, but they are extremely leaky. The sound leak is so bad I might as well have my computer speakers on low to the whole room. Unusable for the office, they have to go back."
1,Don't Buy These Without Listening to Them First,I bought these based on the good reviews I'd read but once I got them I was extremely disappointed in them. Maybe I'm just used to better quality than some of the other reviewers but in my opinion the sound quality of these headphones is terrible. You get almost no bass response at all. There is a very noticeable hiss at all volumes and the volume will only go to a certain level no matter what the source volume is set at. The earphones are comfortable but do make your ears hot. They are like wearing earmuffs. The seller I bought them from wouldn't allow returns of earphones so I ended up giving them to my teenage son. $65 wasted.
2,My first return to Amazon,"Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no problem with the fitting of the headphones or the charging cradle. And I really don't want to attribute the 2 star review to the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones. Although our TV is not ancient, it is an older model and although I tried every conceivable hook-up there was and let the headphones charge for more than the 24-hour period, I could never get rid of the constant static. Finally, after a fair amount of trial and error, I repackaged them in the original boxes and applied for an online refund with Amazon (my very first refund), printed out the labels and authorization and returned it to Amazon.Of course, I was disappointed because they seemed like good headphones but not compatible with our TV. I had no problem with the return and it was convenient to apply and get the necessary labels online."
2,Very uncomfortable,"The earcups have no rotational adjustment and they dig into the front of your ears/temples. I don't understand how they can be touted as comfortable! I guess the sound was pretty good, and the simplicity of the stand....but I sent them back."
4,Works well,"This product works very well and allows a person with hearing loss to hear everything on TV clearly. The only drawback is that, when someone is wearing the earphones, they have to be removed to hear what the person next to you is saying because they block sound not coming from the TV."
1,Soo Noisy,The headset is soo Noisy it's not worth it and the raing is about 5 meters more than that you will hear nothing but the silly channel noise
1,Extremely noisy,"I am returning this headphones because there is not a single place in my entire apartment where I can use these without ambient noise. It was very disappointing. I purchased these because of the high rating reviews, but sorry, they don't work for me."
2,not a good item,"I got it 2 years ago and I didn't use it a lot, just once in a while. After couple of months the sound was interrupting from time to time and the sound quality was poor. Changed the batteries and nothing changed. The led on the base stays lit even if the headphones are off. This is not a good item to buy for sure."
3,Happy Meal Instructions,"If you cannot find instructions on how to hook up this device don't bother. there are none. Just a few pictures and a few troubleshooting lines. If your wondering why the power light does not come on when you plug in the base its because you have to turn on the headphones too. If you have no sound there is a tiny 3 position switch on the base. slide it to a new position. for the best results plug this into the headphone jack on your stereo system (adapter supplied) and not into the TV's audio output. this will mute the sound and only allow to channel to the headphones. It is light weight and comfortable. sound is just fine for music and tv. the headphones do not block out outside noises (doorbell, vacuum, people talking) if you just want to listen to tv-music without bothering others this is the way to go."
4,My husband can now sleep at night.,"I am a bit hard of hearing LOL. This happens as we get older. My husband is still working and needs to get up quite early in the morning. Because I am a night owl I watch TV while I'm knitting or crocheting for charity. Even through a bedroom door and down a hallway, he could still hear the TV because I had the volume turned up so loud. That's all changed since I purchased this product. I can put the TV on a very low setting or even turn it to mute and they still work. I can walk all over the entire house and have perfect hearing for whatever program/movie I'm watching.My only complaint is that I can't seem to adjust these to fit my head - so - I can't bend my head down without holding on to the headphones else they would slip off. Either I have a small head or the headphones are made for the guys. HMMM that could be."
1,"Another ill-conceived, dated ""comeback"" DEVO CD - no no no!","Again, I've tried to listen/love this highly mediocre ""comeback"" CD from the mighty DEVO, but the bottom line is that, like their earlier ""comeback"" effort on Enigma, this seriously BLOWS BIG TIME. Even for longtime DEVO fans/collectors, you'll be hard pressed to find ONE good track on this horrid CD - just lots of annoying, grating, hyperactive, tinny sounding late 80s/early 90s synth-pop masquerading as pop-art. Toss this in the trash and go back and listen to DUTY NOW, ARE WE NOT MEN, etc. The thing is, DEVO STILL ROCK LIVE, why can't they deliver in the studio? It's as if they have RUN OUT OF IDEAS...or at least passion."
3,"decent product, misleading description","The product works fine, but it is not part of the P series as it states in the description. It is part of the A series. Someone unaware that the ""A"" in the item number designates the series may be confused. The product does as shown in the sample image. I would have preferred a square filter, having an area without the effect so you could emphasize a particular light if there were more than one. Still a good product for what it is."
5,so good,First listen: some songs were amazingly awesome.Second listen: all songs were amazingly awesome.The lyrics are really powerful - I enjoy this album in many different moods.
2,Does not really exite,"The thirty second clips of the songs on this album are a bit seductive. Its ok, I guess, but deffinatly nothing special. In fact I found Inhale Exhale to be incredably cliche. By the way, you have to see some of their music vids. when the singer is screaming he looks hilarious!!!"
3,crappy case,"The tab on the case peeled off the outer lining the very first time I tried to open it. Really shoddy workmanship on the case, but the tea set is beautiful and much like the one I had when I was little. The pink scarf inside isn't lined and frayed right away. The package says for ages 8 and up, but I got it for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it."
3,Very nice but...(Addendum-no buts),"While my wife loved the necklace and the matching ear rings she only wore it for about a week before the stone fell out.Great price, looks great, earned me a few points, and then ended in tragedy.I wrote that review and the next day a rep from Silver Insanity contacted me and offered to replace the item. So I'll bump them up to 5 stars based on some excellent customer service and a good product at a reasonable price."
2,I must be stupid to have spent 5 bucks for this,"I was expecting a lot more from this book. After reading some articles about it, I was interested to know more. Although this is well written, what I got was no more than what I could get through google. Some real world examples and anecdotes would have made this book great, but instead we get some general abstract theory about stupidity.One thing that I found interesting was the affirmation that any person can be stupid, whatever his or her other characteristics (race, gender, IQ, social status, etc.) are. But again, real world examples were missing. I still prefer the simpler Forest Gump definition: ""Stupid is as stupid does""."
5,"Riveting, funny, gritty and real.","This thirty minute documentary is about ironworkers and much more. Grueling work, wild lifestyle, comaradarie, and family. We highly recommend this film."
1,basically useless,"I purchased this book before moving to Malaysia. I haven't found any of the information in it useful. It didn't prepare me for Malaysian culture in any way. I am wondering if it is about a different country. I live in Kuala Lumpur now and the book certainly doesn't apply to this city. Maybe the author is from another part of the country but I really doubt this causes the problem. She talks about ghosts and probably old Malay traditions. The only useful information is that you need to bring your sweater because the offices are way over-cooled.As a matter of fact there is not much valid information about Malaysian living from an expat's point of view on the net. If you are planning to move to Malaysia try to contact someone who lives here, preferably not some bored housewife who is very happy just going to the mall all day. Pretty much that is all you can do in this city.So, save your money and don't buy the book."
5,Gogi Grant at her peak,"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Gogi Grant is arguably the female vocal equivalent of Vic Damone. No singer has a purer voice in my view. Especially great is her version of Wrap Your Trouble In Dreams which she does in an appropriately light fashion. Ironically, her biggest hit ""The Wayward Wind"" is my least favorite song on this album."
5,jenny rocks!,"This book is a definite must have for students planning on a career in the music field. The information is well researched and written in a clever yet concise manner. I would certainly highly recommend this book for teenagers, their parents and school counselors."
2,Lots of storage but...,This cabinet has lots of storage but the whey that the door storage units is set up is shoddy at best as well as the shelving the unit as a whole is well built. It is almost as if the interior was an afterthought. The shelves sage under the weight of a normal load of dvd's the door storage is glued together and I have had two come unglued when using the supplied glue. The only parts that are built well are the exterior and the top drawers.
3,I love Joan Hess,"..but this is not her greatest work. The major story of the book is the best, the other short stories aren't worth the read."
2,Not a Chance,"I can't review this product, I didn't have a chance to use it because of missing parts, this product was not functional."
1,Achtung,"Compact, light, user friendly, easy menu, but playback stopped working after 3 hours of filming (showed grey lines) and had to be returned."
1,VERY ANGRY AND DISAPPOINTED,"Mine was great for a while, but now it eats tape too. It's COMPLETELY useless. Canon knows there is a design flaw, and they should fix them for free or provide compensation to users."
2,Just wait yours will eat tapes too,All those that wrote great reviews about the camera will be back extolling how their camcorder now eats tapes. I've had my ZR-10 since Dec 2000 and now just in the last couple of weeks of Nov 2003 it is eating tapes and will not accept a brand new tape.Luckily (maybe) I did buy the extended warranty that the retailer offered and it is still under some sort of warranty. We'll see.Note: When I peeked inside it appears that the two fingers/rods that wrap the tape around the head are barely holding on. They move back and forth as you rock the camera in your palm.Based on the other avalanche of reviews I will not ever buy another Canon product.
5,the tunnel's light,"It's an entertaining book. It grabs your attention and it is a pleasure to read it, because each tome and at any given moment it moves an inside switch and the light comes. From there you can explore more and more reason of addiction, alcoholism, etc etc And you go back and forth reasoning, creating a thesis as life's situation change around. I would recommend to those who have decided or consider explore and understand the activities that happen inside of us."
1,Don't waste your money,"While I'm sure these techniques have some benefit to adults with a desire to change, children get nothing from this book. And for those of us with LD children desperate for help, this felt like snake oil. Sorry to be that harsh, but if felt like the author has a life coaching, biofeedback business and thought, ""gosh these techniques should work for anyone. I'll tap into the huge LD market with my title."" There are many, many great ADHD books out there for parents, teens and elementary kids. You could get 4 books that offer real advice for the price of this one.This rating system forced me to give it a star, it didn't really deserve any."
4,Husband Finally Stopped Complain,"I am a late sleeper while my husband is a early one. So, here is the typically nights before I purchasing this product -- I laid in the bed read books and watch/listen to the TV while my husband flip over and over at the side and complaining ""can you stop your TV? I want to sleep"". Then I was like ""I've already turned volume to very low, how come you still not satisfied!""... The same conversation kept on and on every day for the past couple years. Then I saw this product and thought this is great for us. It works!!! Now I can watch the TV while the early bird sleeps. But it would be perfect if it had more band width selections."
2,Poorly Made Headphones that don't work,This unit does not work as advertised. I have a new 50-inch Samsung top quality PDP-TV and a somewhat older Panasonic 42-inch PDP-TV and this unit will not work with either. The only TV it works with is an ancient CRT. Something is wrong with the wiring that comes with this unit and the connection even when it does work is unreliable. Don't waste your money on this item.
2,Not real happy,"The first time I used the headphones, they jumped off the channel I was watching and I was suddenly hearing Fox news. My neighbor who lives directly accross the street happened to be at my house. He said ""that's what we have on right now"". A few days later I was using them and was suddenly listening to a NFL game. I asked the neighbor, and sure enough that's what they were watching. From that I'm convinced that I'm picking up their signal instead of my own. I haven't used them a lot, but am convinced their defective."
1,Won't Work With Digital Audio Out,"The hook-ups on the base for these headphones, that plug into the TV, are not compatible with new digital TVs such as Panasonic flatscreens. Our TV is a digital audio format, has cable audio hook-up ports, and the headphone base is set up with a tri-color prong adaptor. Had to return these and wasted $12 on shipping them back."
2,"Sound good, battery life horrible","Senheiser has a good name when it comes to headphones and speakers. Counting on that reputation I bought my first set of these earphones to listen to my TV without disturbing others. The sound quality was good, could always be better, but for the price I can live with that. But, a new set of AAA batteries die within bout 16 hours of listening. I expected the battery life to be a lot better than this - to be honest I had expected at least 3-4 weeks at 3 hours of average listening time per day. I am so disappointed in this. I should have gone for the rechargeable version paying about forty bucks extra for 2 sets. Cannot even return them since it has been just over 3 months since I got them."
5,Good clarity of sound,The sound on these ear phones is very clear and the signal travels through a solid wood closed door in my entertainment cabinet with no problem.
3,not bad,"Overall we are happy. However, You do get static and noise at times and you have to tweak the tuning. If you hold your head weird you can induce it too. You wont notice at all when the show is on, but you will notice it in quiet spots or when no sound is playing. Kind of annoying but we have used others and they were worse. This is a good cheap set. Comfortable for long movies, can wear all day."
4,Good. But can be improved,"Good sound quality. Good working distance. I bought a refurbished one for $30. It worth the money.Still, there are something can be improved.1. Little bit background noise.2. If the headphone can automatically turn off will be great. Because sometimes, I forgot to turn off the headphone and the battery ran out.3. If the headphone is rechargeable will be more convenient."
1,Potential threat to pacemaker wearers!,"ATTENTION: MAJOR RISK FOR PACEMAKER WEARERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Buried deeply in a small leaflet that most purchasers would probably ignore is a warning that unusually strong magnetic fields generated by these headphones could cause serious problems for pacemaker wearers. No doubt, some folks will play down this risk, but any risk of death should be taken seriously, in my opinion. This information should be prominently displayed on the package and here at the Amazon site, but it is not.Caveat Emptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TAP"
1,These are just awful.,"This product is just terrible. They are confusing to set up and once you set them up they hardly work. I've spent copious amounts of time looking for good headphones and when I got these i had hoped this would have been my lucky break, It wasn't. They have terrible connection, and they don't hug the ears. The constant static noise is unbearable. I think i have spent more time trying to tune them than I have been using them. I wish that these headphones were wired there's actually more wires and less freedom involved with this than wired headphones. Let me get to the pros and consPros:ComfortableWirelessBattery lifeCons:Constant static noiseMore wires involvedDon't hug the earsHard to set upShort rangeAmbiguous and even incomprehensible instructionsBatteries must be replacedTuning it is a hassleThe major problem is that even if you get the perfect tune there is still a static noise in the backaround"
4,Remanufactured Sennheiser RS-110 Wireless Headphones,This item was a pretty good deal for the money. Good quality sound it does use batteries fairly quickly and does not a a long range. You will need to purchase rechargeable batteries to use with this product for sure. But they do have great sound and good quality construction.
4,Excellent headset and sound!,"I got this because I like to play Grand Theft Auto (I know, I know, save your comments, a thirty something playing that game, but it's frickin awesome!). However, the language is not something that my kids should hear, so I got these headphones.Sound great, hookup is a snap, and they work fine so far (a couple hours in). Much less than I expected to pay also."
2,Sennheiser wireless Headphones,"I expected it to work easily. After testing it on my tv and trying all the channels, I was getting different frequencies from radio station but none from my tv set."
1,not worth it.,"I've read a lot of the reviews here at amazon before purchasing this headphone. they were mostly positive, and a lot of the negative ones seem to be from defective units.well, the one I got was brand new, and works as advertised so far. I was happy with it after connecting it to my home pc and listening to a few songs on it.Then I started discovering its flaws, and they far outweight the pros. While watching a movie, there was noticeable hissing noise that is very annoying. I tried to change channels and fine tune it, but even standing two feet away from the transmitter, you can't get rid of it.And then there's the transmitter. It has a ""feature"" that turns itself off after 5 minutes, and when this happens, the headphone will just throw a very loud static noise on your ears. After getting spooked by the phone a few times I simply stopped using it and went back to a wired one."
5,"Great soundig, light weight, got no complaints","These headphone are great, plenty of bass. highs sound great as well. I got these as a gift and so far I'm glad I got them, I haven't had them long enough to judge about the battery life, I'm sure they can't go through batteries that fast though. They're great for music, watching movies, and playing single player games."
4,"Finally, great sound for the price, some unwanted noice though","I've been using an older RF wireless headphones made by someone else, it was getting old to the point where it started to have a lot of static in the background and the worse part, periodic crack, crack, crack... VERY annoying. Just received this new headphones, WOW, very clean sounding, good stereo, good range, Noooo complaints for the most part, the only thing I wished is that instead of using AAA batteries, would've been more convenient, at least for me, using AA, since I have a crap load of rechargeable AA here. Now, I have to go and buy a pack of rechargeable AAA.11/9/2010 updateLately, been noticing some unwanted intermittent noise, helps by moving your head just a few inches when it happens, temporarily gets rid of it. So I lowered my 5 star rating to 4."
2,Didn't last more than a month,"Sennheiser lasted for about a month, then the batteries wore out, I replaced the batteries, and then the lite on the wireless tower keep blinking, and I checked all connections, and finally it just went KAPUT...... I threw it in the trash."
1,Not working,It blew out as soon as I plugged it in. The enhancer may have worked for about 5 minutes. Wasted money. Should have bought another brand.
1,The quality is not good,It is somehow broken already after just several months use.The voice quality is just so so as well. Disappointed about the product
3,Good quality--,"Good all around performance xcept 4 battery life- If U want 2 replace batteries twice a week, then purchase this item~"
5,Very pleased!,So far the headphones have worked to my satisfaction. I'm on the computer a lot and also constantly wandering between 3 rooms for items or information that I need and the music I'm listening to never fades. I'm wondering why did they have to remanufactured in the first place? Did someone fall into the pool while wearing them? The componants looked new with no indication that they were remanufactured. This was a great offer!
5,excellent product.,This is the 3rd cordless Sennheiser that I own. The 2 previously purchased 3 years ago are still working well. Now I have 3 cordless headset with bases on 3 different TVs and 3 family members can use 3 head sets watching movies on the same TV (at any location) without moving the base and without bothering others.
5,good product + good price = satisfied,"Bought for use in my bedroom, so I may watch TV after my wife goes to sleep. Works great for this. Sound reproduction is excellent - clear, no interference or distortion. I am thoroughly satisfied. The reproduction quality and transmission range might be more of an issue if used with a stereo for music, and/or through walls, but this is secondary for me. I haven't even tried such a setup yet. If I search for a quibble to mention, it might be the flat soft panels over the ear pads. I expected typical around-ear headphones. These are fine for me, but a few might not prefer them due to comfort or sound leakage. Neither of these issues should be a concern for most."
4,This was a great deal,"This is our second pair of Sennheiser headphones. Our primary pair is the RS120 rechargeable set which is very good and worth the extra money. But, this pair works great for it's intended purpose; riding our exercise bicycle. You can tune out all the extraneous sounds and focus on music/tv/etc. The refurb ones work great as long as you don't mind the no frills packaging - i wouldn't give these as a gift."
4,A VERY GOOD BUY,"I was challenged in setting up the product using Dish Network. With a little help from a more technically proficient friend, we got it up and running. These earphones are great! They allow me to watch TV with my wife, with no challenge in the volume department. Or, I can watch TV without the sound running her out of the house. Very good results at an excellent price."
4,Wireless Sennheiser Headphones,"Excellent headphones. Great for watching TV without disturbing others and getting superior sound to boot! No more having to keep the volume too low and missing most of the dialogue. Comfortable even after using for a few hours at a time. No hiss, no static and very good range. Would get a rechargeable model if doing it all over, since I put in a lot of time using them and two little triple-a Energizers or Duracells can only last so long. I gave them 4 not 5 stars only since the volume and tune controls are a little difficult to adjust when wearing and the batteries go as mentioned. But overall, a fine headphone, well worth the price and serves it's purpose well."
2,headphones,"purchased on 4-26-09, worked good for about a month, then kept switching off and all i would get is noise. would have to turn tv of then on so it would turn back on. what a piece of crap. demand replacement or money back."
3,First wirless headphones,"These are my first wireless headphones and so far i'm pleased with my purchase.Sound: The sound reproduction is pretty good. Bass has some umph. There is a ever so slight hiss when music gets quiet or when listening to pod casts/voice. There hiss is also present when tracks change. It also seems to pick up some intereference at times even at different channels. I guess that's life with wireless.Comfort: So far I've worn them for about 4 hours straight and no ill affects so far.Range: my studio isn't huge, but i've been 20ft away from the base behind a wall with no signal degredation.Conclusion: I'm satisfied with my purchase, i'm giving 3 stars cause of the hissing and interference."
3,"They're okay, but not the greatest.","I recently purchased the RS-110 from Cosco because I could no longer wait to purchase a pair and they were reasonably priced. My reviews are mixed. I was happy with the radio signal when listening to Maple Leaf games, but primarily purchased them to listen to CDs on a mini system. I found I have to continually play with them to get a quality signal. At a low volume level they are okay, but at that level the music is heard over a low static. When I turn the volume up to eliminate the static, I get distortion. Feedback is also a problem. I don't have this problem with my HD-495 which are great (but are not wireless). Maybe, I will have to wait for the technology to evolve."
3,Good product in most ways... but...,"I'm not into 3-page long reviews, especially when a product has been so well reviewed. I'll just add one or two details from my experience:1. Sound - the sound is reasonable, but not great. The construction of the headphones is such that your ears are directly covered by a fabric and there is no ""cup"" structure as I've become used to from better headphones, like the Bose offering, for example. That leaves the experience kind of flat, allows outside noise in, and generally leads to the next comment:2. Comfort - I find these HOT to wear. The fabric and foam that sits against and covers my ears get hot within 3-4 minutes of use and is uncomfortable, therefore I have not used these for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. In hot weather, they are unbearable.That's it - good product otherwise - setup, use, etc. is easy and straightforward."
5,A QUALITY PRODUCT,"These wireless headphones have lived up to all my expectations. The bass is exceptional, in my opinion. No problem with hiss.If one is concerned about aesthetics, the headphones appear quite bulky when wearing."
1,worked only two days,"This product was flaky from the start; when first plugged in, the power light on the sending unit did not come on, but then suddenly came on about 10 minutes later without being touched. It worked okay for a day or two, but then the power light went out again and never came back on. I returned it for credit, and Amazon handled the return in easy fashion, even paying return postage. I have had other Sennheiser products that I was pleased with, but this was a definite lemon."
4,"First one crapped out, second one works awesome.","So I bought this because my aunt's baby sleeps upstairs from my room. I figured that I would be considerate and buy these headphones when I watch tv. It works great for what its suppose to do. Theres no stand for this headphone by the way. I would suggest that you buy some extra AAA batteries as I'm sure these headphones will drain batteries in a month or so per 2 AAA. I prob went through already 3 sets of AAA since I bought this.As I stated in the title, my first one crapped out. It randomly decided to stop working, even though it was working just a few hours before. I used new batteries and changed the frequencies on both the base and the headphone and it didnt work. So I returned it, and got it replaced.So 4 stars now. I would suggest it."
2,Discovered a lemon too late!,"The headset on this is bulky. The sound is great but sometimes gives you a zing of static in your ear. Shortly after 30 days usage and return expiration, the headset stops working. I thought it was the batteries but the a/c plug stopped getting current. Don't know why. I got accustomed to listening thru the headset so as to not disturb others but I assure you I won't get another one without a warranty."
4,"Comfortable, good sound",I use these for late night tv viewing to avoid disturbing my neighbors. They are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. My only complaint is that the volume could be a little more intense.
1,Buyer beware!,"Sennheiser Rs110. poor reception, shallow distance, no hanger for headphone provided. I would return the product except the return shipping and restocking fee would be make it prohibitive. Save your money."
4,Excellent Value,"We have a loft and 2 tv sets within 30 ft of each other . We now have 2 headphone sets also.Total peace within the house, they are great and do the job required.No frills just great wireless headphones that work very well.Make sure you plug them into the component you are using for the best results. (IE DVD put them into the audio )"
1,flimsy,"Sound was great, but they don't fit the head well. I leaned out of my chair to pick up a pen & they fell off--no more sound! a 2 ft fall & they're done! If they are that badly made I can't recommend them unless you sit perfectly still in your chair!"
1,"Don't bother with this, get the real KINO restoration.","Every public domain company tries to lure the unsuspecting fan to their product by using words like ""Enhanced"" or ""Digitally Mastered"". These words mean NOTHING if good master material is not used in the first place. Most professional companies never use these words, so avoid DVD products that use them.If you want the best presentation of the Buster Keaton Shorts, buy either of these RESTORED Kino Video releases!Buster Keaton - Short Films Collection: 1920 - 1923 (3-Disc Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] - for Blu-rayBuster Keaton - Short Films Collection: 1920 - 1923 (3-Disc Ultimate Edition)- for DVD"
3,Three Sides Live,"This is a truncated version of the landmark live release, with Tangent (19:56) missing (for those from the old-school, side two of the first of the two-LP set).Included is Poland (22:56), Barbakane (13:52) and Horizon (20:50), which the exact 1984 edition that appeared in the United Kingdom. It took about a dozen years there, but the four tracks made it on an authorized release.The cost may be less than the ""complete"" concert, but that may be the only selling point with both issues in the marketplace."
1,Terrible,"This is most unlistenible album of 2005. I love "" You're a Woman, I'm a Machine"", but the remixes are terrible. It's as if this record was made just so they could put something else out. Not a single track is standible for it's entire length.A remix changes a song and creates something else, but these remixes rip apart what is good about Death From Above 1979 and offer nothing in it's place."
2,straps not made for bag,"the straps were tough an huge not to mention the logo. if you don't know what you're looking at you would definately think it was a purse from the local store. it seams the purse would best fit someone going back up ""the hill"". i returned this purse and purchased the new LV speedy."
4,GREAT collection from a less recognized band,"I don't like lengthy reviews so straight to the meat. These guys were (are?) good - why weren't they more popular??If you like Kansas, Thin Lizzy, Starz, Triumph, and the like, then give this a listen. Stand out cuts are Tonight, Flesh and Blood, Hollywood, and Touch Me Tonight. Heck, the Christmas Song is even pretty catchy!Check it out! Especially if you're looking for some misic that isn't made anymore. This will take you back to the good old days...."
3,A START,"THIS CD IS A GOOD START AND HOLDEN IS WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON BUT, WHILE BOTH CDS IN HIS SET GET OFF TO A GOOD START, THEY SOMEHOW LOSE THEIR WAY AND BECOME AN AIMLESS COLLECTION OF MELLOW, SPACEY TRACKS.POTENTIALLY, HOLDEN IS HEADING IN THE DIRECTION OF DJ TIESTO AND MARK SHULZ, BUT, SOMEHOW, MISSES THE MARK. IT IS NOT A BAD PAIR OF CD'S, JUST DIRECTIONLESS, AVERAGE, AND A TAD BORING. I MUST CONFESS, THAT I AM LATELY OVERWHELMED BY THE WORKS OF MARK SHULZ AS WELL AS ARMIN VAN BUUREN, WHO SEEMS TO BE UNABLE TO MAKE A WRONG MOVE.I AM A BIT SPOILED NOW."
2,"Very, very basic","This is one hour of a very knowledgable person, Vivian Kistler, talking at you rapidly about the basics of picture framing. It skipped over several steps related to mitering and sizing, and really rushes through everything else. This is really the basics of the basics, which you could probably deduce for yourself if you sat at Framesplus for half an hour and just watched."
3,Nice Cover; Hit or Miss Contents,"I commend the editors for the packaging. But as my momma once pointed out, pretty packages can be deceiving. And there is no greater disappointment than opening some tantalizing package only to discover that what's underneath the pleasant surface is socks! Oh, certainly there's a bit of meat and substance, but not nearly what you were hoping to sink your teeth into. I chewed thoughtfully over phrases by Dennis Cooper, Mark Bibbins, Carl Phillips and D. A. Powell. But Marilyn Hacker and Mary Doty left me limp. And the editors showed no shame in including yards of their own weak material, cheapening the overall effect of an otherwise interesting line of garments. For shame, girls!"
3,"Definitely influenced, but a decent album...","You can hear the influence of The Cure in the vocals (and some of the music for that matter) but that's not necessarily a bad thing for me. I agree that this isn't very original but it's a good sound, nonetheless. If you like Rogue Wave and/ or Vampire Weekend you'll like these guys. I'll give this Swedish group credit for a nice album.Matt Zarnstorff"
4,Comfort without looking crappy,"While there are more comfortable shoes, more stylish shoes, better made shoes, and certainly more expensive shoes, the combination that you get with this shoe is very good. The cushioned sole and uppers are not as comfortable as a walking shoe but far more comfortable than a leather sole with stiff leather uppers. The shoe is casual enough and dressy enough for most occasions. At the price it's an excellent value. I bought this pair to replace a pair I had worn out."
3,Could be better.,"I think I'm being very nice by giving three stars, and thats only because of the sex scenes. The problem with this book is that it's very predictable. Another thing that bothered me was the rushing of Mark and Maya's relationship. I'm all for love at first sight but this was ridiculous! He basically fell in love with her at the very beginning of the book, which is page six, and kissing her on page twenty.This book is 239 pages long, if you are smart you will know who the slayer is way before you reach 100. If you want to read about true romance, a real connection between two people, and a good mystery then don't buy this book."
3,"Ok, but.....","I think that this book was okay. I expected more suspense. It had a slow flow. It was a little disjointed. It is a love story that came out of a tragedy with some paranormal aspects thrown in. I would like to read more about the FBI detective and his paranormal abilities and the unique group of FBI agents that he belongs to. I wanted to know more about his relationship with the woman that he was connected to miles away. That was more thrilling than the two main characters that fell in love. Even her best friend was more intriguing than she was. Oh, well...I hope that there is a sequel to this book."
4,President Simonsta,Valueable for study of judaism. Author loses faith by the lies of Rabbis and seeks reconcilation by exposeing truths.Worth the buy.
5,Perfect!,I bought this book to help teach my Kindergarten students the life and importance of St. Patrick. This book is perfect to read to young children! It covers all the major events of his life as well as the legends surrounding St. Patrick. I definitely recommend this book!
2,Ironic -- an unproductive book on productivity,"The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again. So you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea. It seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas. (Come on, man, if you have 10 pages of good ideas, give them to me in 10.) But then again I guess most books in this genre make you do that. Sheesh."
2,"""Getting Things Done"" is much much better","I rated the same author's ""Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"" a five stars on Amazon with the review title ""Excellent! Helpful for all walks of life"". I am so sorry to comment that this ""Ready for Anything"" is an inferior and cliche version of his previous book. Sorry to comment that the author's attempt to write a much more strategic book on productivity had failed miserably. Read ""Getting Things Done"" instead, which is tactical but highly helpful. Dont waste your valuable time and money on this.p.s. I hold no bias on whether a book should be strategic or tactical, or both, as long as it's interesting and helpful."
3,Refreshment for GTD runners,"Book Getting Things Done is the must to start practicing GTD.Ready for Anything is like fresh air and energy for revival of all the enthusiasm you have got when started with GTD. It will help you running for whole life victory (at least in area of managing activities, but what more you want to ""do"")."
1,Lame,"This book is a waste of money. It is a collection of emails that David sent to his subscribers and repackaged in book form. Just stick with the original book, ""Getting Things Done""; you don't need the sequel.Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"
4,Flat n Sharp quickly,First time user of Diamond over stones. Sharpened quicker and flatter using the Extra Coarse/Coarse Fine and a General Tools 809 Chisel/Plane Blade Sharpener method.Didnt need to go to Extra fine as this was way sharper already than what Id ever had it. The only question remaining is how long the Diamonds will last.
3,It's interesting,"The story starts out a little slow, but becomes more interesting. Good if you like stories set in England in the early 1900s."
3,The Blue Last: A Richard Jury Mystery by Martha Grimes,I just can't beleive Ms. Grimes could end it this way. I live for these books so to speak and I was so shocked at the end that I literally threw the book and cursed. The book is a great read though!
2,"""Last"" but not Best","I've been a loyal reader of Martha Grimes books, but this one was a disappointment. There were too many loose ends (and sloppy editing mistakes), too many rambling thoughts, and not enough substance (as much as I tried I couldn't ""buy"" the motive for the murder of Simon Croft). I also hated the cliffhanger ending (before this book, Grimes wouldn't have had to resort to such tricks to sell the next book).That's not to say there weren't bright spots. As always the literary references were compelling and well-placed, and her well-known and loved Long Pidd characters didn't disappoint."
1,Another Dismal Grimes book,"Where does one begin? The last few Grimes books have lacked style, wit and cohesivieness. She does appear to have tired of the characters and of creating an absorbing plot. The plot for The Blue Last is very thin and the book is actually boring in some spots. Too many unanswered questions and once again we have the stock-in-trade children, only this time Gemma is a real mystery. I stopped ""buying"" the hard cover books a few books ago and after reading some of the reviews decided that I would check it out from the library. I'm glad I did because this book is not worth the price. What happened to Martha Grimes? I loved her books and enjoyed the characters even though Melrose and Jury annoyed me by conducting their love lives and romances without benefit of brain. Much like Julia Roberts. I am not saying I won't ever read another Richard Jury book, but I won't pay for it!"
2,Where was the Editor?,"Perhaps a writer as popular as Martha Grimes feels that she does not need an editor but this book proves her wrong. Aside from the typos, which calls for a proofreader, there are many inconsistencies and mistakes. She describes the exterior of a war time pub in London as being decorated with Christmas lights, hardly possible in a city that had gone through the Blitz. A few pages later her character remaks on the problem of traveling at night in London in utter darkness. I quess they turned off the Christmas lights. Jury's cousin is described as being in her 60's and then asks him if he has seen the baby! Whose baby? Certainly not her's. These are just sloppy errors. I leave a discussion of the plot itself to others."
2,Smart animals/dumb detectives/confused readers,"There's something to be said for authors' holding off from annual additions to their series when they can't come up with clear plots. Grimes relies on super-brained animals to get her off the hook. And the notion of the hero swooning and bleeding in the last chapter is one that tired authors use too often. On the other hand, if it allows Jury to get it on with his neighbor/popsy in the next edition, maybe it's worth it."
2,Disappointing,"The usual cast of a Richard Jury tale are here... and they are delightful. Plant is dragged to Italy to authenticate a painting Marshall Trueblood has purchased. Unfortunately, this never really connects back to the main plot in any satisfying way. The characters of the children, Gemma and Benny, are well done, as one expects from this author. But again, there is no satisfying conclusion. The ending comes abruptly, almost as though the author simply got tired of the story and wanted to bring it to an end. This was 4 stars, up until the last couple of chapters. I hope we have not seen the end of Long Pidd...."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"How can the person described as the illigimate daughter be in her 40s? Wouldn't she at least be in her 60s? Who is Gemma? Besides being a horrible ending, nothing is explained that makes any sense. Please help me, I must not understood or my book was missing pages."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I have read all of Martha Grimes books, and will not be buying the next one. The plot wanders, the characters are one dimensional, the humour is missing, and I felt extremely angry at the ending because I felt cheated. I felt it was unfinished and was going to complain to the publisher. Perhaps this is a device of Martha Grimes to entice me to continue to buy her books. It is sad that she has to stoop to this, and her trick has had the opposite effect.Don't buy it, or the next one. Buy P.D.James, Ruth Rendell , Anne Perry and Stephanie Barron instead for satisfaction."
4,outstanding story,"I couldn't wait to read this. I've loved the Jury books for years. This was no disappointment. However, I also didn't like the ending. It was just plain disturbing. The right things were here, the humor, sadness, plot, characters. I didn't see the ending coming. A very moving book, but I'd reccomend reading the other books in the series before this one."
3,Disappointing,"I've read every book in the Richard Jury series and enjoyed them, and so I was delighted when The Blue Last arrived. My delight soon turned to disappointment however. The standard reviews from the critics all address issues of plot and character, but what most distracted me was the uneven writing, poorly contrived metaphors, and generally disjointed narrative. I found it very difficult to get through, sad to say..."
3,"Great sound, but not really comfortable","The sound is really good but after listening for like half hour, my ear will begin to feel uncomfortable."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"This is a great read. It takes your standard, boring, overthinking guy, and makes him deal with a high-tech world that everyone, even cats, can deal with better. It is hilarious seeing him deal with situations that he and his cat, Catreece, stumble into."
4,NICE PROJECTOR - RIPPED ON PRICE,"The picture this projector makes is very good, it does suffer slightly from the rainbow effect common with single chip DLP projectors. I wish the sound would play a little louder.When I bought this projector it was priced at $1499.00, two weeks after I got it the price dropped to $1299.00. I thought well ok I guess I can live with that - prices do drop on electronic equipment all the time. Now the price is $999.00, come on OPTOMA, you really stuck it to early adopters.I'd recommend this projector to anyone once the price drops to $699.00, should be in the next several weeks."
1,Disappointed!,"I was looking forward to purchasing and owning the product, but after I completed the transaction I was told it was not available. The only comment I received was ""The product is no longer available."" I have one question: why sell something if it's ""not available""? I was very disappointed indeed!"
5,Wonderful,One of the greatest sports movies of all time and is abut more than a sport. It's a great story that we all face wether we are cyclists or not.
4,the all american apple pie movie,"It,s West Side Story on bikes. The haves keep knocking the have not,s,so to prove they are worthy they set out to win a bike race and show the college joe,s up. Well acted,moves well,decent story. Basic theme has been done many times in many ways, but this is one of the better efforts."
3,More like 3.5,"The relationships, and the integrity with which they're treated, are exceptional; of note are the protagonist's parents, who are actually treated like human beings! The film also has a ""Rocky""-like arc and climax, so it's quite pleasing- but not heavy-handed, fortunately."
3,Dated,"While waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail I mentioned to various friends that I had purchased it. Each of them...all in their mid forties said it was a good movie. Alas, seeing it for the first time has me wondering when did they last see it. If you watched the movie back in '79/80 then it probably holds nostalgia and a good example of the sort of ""coming of age"" movies being made then, but as someone who saw it for the first time in 2010 the movie is dated. The plot line is fairly transparent and somewhat obvious. The DVD transfer is poor - a higher quality may have given the movie and the characters more impact. Shame, as I had high expectations for the movie. Surprised it was nominated for 5 Oscars."
5,My favorite movie,"My absolute favorite movie. Anyone who is a fan of cycling will love this movie. Certainly worth watching, well directed and great acting. I don't know what else to say, its just great!"
4,Showing its age,This is a charming little film but it is really beginning to show its age! Nice and eccentric but moves a little slowly at times...as a mad cyclist I loved it
5,A great story,"Highly recommended. Have turned several people on to this ""little"" movie and they each found it delightful. Works for many reasons---everyone finds something they really like about it."
4,lock,This item functions very well on a pocket door; with a locking device. I have it installed on one of my bathroom doors.
5,This is a great cookbook~!,I absolutely love this cookbook~! It's great~ The seller did a great job getting it to me quickly & without damamge. Great transaction. Thanks~!
1,Based on too few sources,"This work could be good, but it is too one sided to provide much real information. The sources used from the articles are drawn from too few writers. There are also many subjects that are not covered in favor of pulp paganism."
4,It works..and the price is right,"I purchased two of these and noticed upon initial fitting that there was a lot of wiggle room for this plate. After thinking it over, I added some layers of electrical tape to the sides and that snugged it up nicely. After that adjustment, it worked great. I would recommend and will buy again."
5,Nice,"I bought this for a tricycle that I bought in a thrift store for my son. The tricycle was missing grips. The red matched, so I ordered them. They're fine.What else can you say about grips? They do have holes for ribbons, but I've yet to find ribbons for boys, only girls."
3,Not one of the best,"Having read many of the later books in this series, this first novel was a little disappointing. Pendergast is so undeveloped in this novel that I felt ""cheated"". I am sure that I would have felt very differently had I read this one first."
5,A top-notch thriller....Enter: Pendergast,"I think this is one of the best books I have ever read. The plot kept twisting and twisting, which made for a great and thrilling read.This book made me instantly leap into its sequel, Reliquary.Looking forward to reading all of Pendergast's tales.Move over Sherlock Holmes!"
4,"Relic: A combination of science, suspense and sleuthing...","A combination of antropology, biology, environmentalactivism and natural history, Relic is a thrilling, page-turning adventure. Plausable, believable and engrossing, I got a sunburn because I was so involvedin this book! &lt;P&gt;Using technical terms, but explaining everything in plain English, this book is a cross between JurassicPark and Clive Cussler. It has some gore, but nothing excessive or gratuitous: most of it is necessary to increase the sympathetic fear level of the reader.The clear description of the creature's stench and sight will have you shuddering.&lt;p&gt;The book is not without faults: one loose end was never explained (what happened to Pendegrasts's wife)and it was slightly predictable in places. Near the endthe suspense peters ou"
3,not the best book i've ever read,"i read this based on the great reviews it received on this website- well, i was disappointed- first of all, it was quite far fetched- but if it had been better written then i wouldn't have doubted it (like the harry potter series- those books are so well written, that you completely believe everything stated is true)-as well, it may sound strange but knowing what the creature was and what it looked like (the picture on the cover) totally ruined it for me- there was nothing to find out- we all know who was committing these grisly murders/what was hiding in that museum-1/3 into the book, the detective and female lead started to bore me and i just couldn't get into it- ended up skimming the rest of the way through-"
4,stephen king would blush,"This book was soo much better than the film! If you like horror/thriller novels- this is a must read. Almost as good as King, a thousand times better than Koontz."
5,definetly worth the time,"Although this book may not be for everyone, it definetly is written far better than most thrillers that I've read. There is a subplot beyond just a scary ""monster"" and although it takes some time to get into and a few instances of over thinking a scene, it makes you feel like you are really there. The setting couldn't be any more perfect and it's very easy to imagine that you are trapped in the basement. I caught the hairs on my neck raising a few times. It's definetly a book that I will be rereading again in the near future, and is quite a bit better than its sequel. The movie did not come close to doing it justice...read it and decide for yourself."
4,"If you saw the movie, read the book anyway","We all know ""Relic"" was a less-than great movie. Actually, I hated it. I read ""Cabinet of Curiosities"" by Perston-Child out of sequence, and so enjoyed the adventures of Special Agent Pendergast, I wanted to read more. My search lead me back to ""Relic,"" and despite my skepticism, I bought the book. I was not disappointed, and knowing the plot from the movie did not spoil the book at all. As usual, the best parts of the book are lost before it hits the big screen. A great read."
4,Lost sleep over this one...,"Wow, this book really packs a wallop in the form of page-turning, heart-racing, fast-paced plot. It was reminiscent of Jurassic Park, only much better written. It kept me up past my bedtime a couple of nights."
2,forced myself to finish,"this book started off ok and seemed interesting, half way in it slowed and three quarters it died. The only reason i finished this one was because of how far i read into it. The end of this book was a travesty."
5,What a thriller. A real page-turner.,What an excellent book. This compares nothing to Jurassic Park & The Lost World. I couldn't put the book down. The authors took the imaginative and made it appear real!! I loved it!!
4,They choose the most fascinating subject matter.,"You can always count on Preston and Child to give you a good read, thrilling, unpredictable, with interesting characters and a sense of humor."
5,A Fun and Frightening Read,"If you plan to see the movie version of this book. Wait, the movie is pretty good, but you must read the book first. It is a great book. Scary and fun to read. You can not put this book down. Seriously, if you want a good read, read this."
3,Enjoyed this book,"This a great beginner tale of Special Agent Pendergast. One can tell that this is one of the first, simply because the authors get better with every book they write. I say this alot for many books and will say it again for this book, the book was better than the movie"
3,"A graduate student, a cop and an FBI agent walk into a museum...","Whilst RELIC turned out to be precisely what I expected after having seen the movie first, I found myself pleasantly surprised by the character of Pendergast. A mix of Christie 's Poirot and The X Files Mulder, he brought a intrinsic depth to the story that would have otherwise been flat."
5,Debut title for author duo... One of the best books out,"Not much to say other than this was one of the best conceived and written books of its kind I have ever read. Preston and Child do not write with such a ""sterile"" style as Crichton, and that really gives them the edge.This is a scary damn read. Very much so."
2,I thought it was rather silly.,"Almost like an Ed Wood movie. Super-duper super-sophisticated FBI agent carrying a gun (a full metal jacket .45 five-shot REVOLVER?) that is unloaded - he waits until he is on a public walkway to load it (.45's are automatics); another goofy cop spinning his gun around on the table (sounds like a friend of the doopy cops in Ed Wood's ""Plan 9"" who used their guns to scratch their heads.All the cops, except of course for super-duper, sound like Ed Norton or something.Hey, if these guys don't even know what street the Museum of Natural History is on, how much can they really know about it? It's between 77th street and 81st streets. It's not on 72nd street.About that bit in the flooded tunnel - why didn't someone just boost someone else up to the ladder?It was a silly story. The only part that interested me was the descriptions of the parts of the museum that are not open to the public, but how much of that description is accurate?2 1/2 stars."
5,Relic,"If you want to read a fascinating thriller that will keep you glued to every page, this is the book for you. I couldn't put it down. Well written and well crafted, the authors' draw you in. You will never look at a museum the same way."
1,1 of My Worst Book Purchases,"I run an internet company and was looking for a book on some good guerilla marketing, i.e, cheap, ways of getting our name out there. I was excited about getting this book, but quickly realized within the 1st 5 pages that this book is terrible. He spends more than half the time trying to convince me that the internet is important. What a joke. I learned nothing. It is much more valuable and cheaper to read something online. Now I'll have to do that or look deeper for a good PR book."
4,A Good De-spooking,"One of my favorite books on the topics discussed. Fuzzy here and there, perhaps, but the fairest assessment and broad evaluation of many theories extant. The criticisms of modern science, the enslavement of theory to mathematics, and the noting of ""forgotten"" observations (e.g. photon's frame of reference) are perhaps the most important discussions. I wonder how the scientific community is reacting to these! Gribbon's very healthy attitutde that all theories are useful, and none are complete is most welcome. He dubs such theories ""myths"" which is an intriguing metaphor I'd like him to elaborate on. And by the way, he also presents some theories which may one day ""de-spook"" the problems. Please read and reply! db"
1,Sad......,"We were so excited to get this for Christmas. We opened it up, put it together and low and behold it was pure and utter frustration for all of us. There isn't enough power to turn the wheel. The attachments don't work. The clay will not stay on the wheel. We finally gave up. We will be sending it back to the manufacturer with a letter. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Horrible!,I opened it up and sat my son down to get creative and nothing worked. The on button on the foot petal was stuck on so you couldnt turn it off without unplugging it. The motor power bogs down so much it hardly moves just by lightly touching your finger on it. And none of the tools are strong enough to actually create anything but a blob. I am not happy and this is going back to the store on monday. Maybe I will find a better one out there to replace it with. He was really looking forward to this and so was I. This toy is a huge dissappointment.
2,not enough power,not enough power to do anything. if you push on the clay to shape it the wheel stops. don't waste your money!
2,Disapointed in Terry,"I felt bored through most of this book. I kept waiting for it to get better because after all, it is Terry McMillan! It was just one problem after another for Marilyn with no relief in sight. Then after all she went through and complained about she stayed with her bonehead husband and took on her sister's children! So what really changed in her life? Nothing. I read this whole book for nothing.I had to ask myself - is Terry losing her touch?"
4,Middle Age Drama,"The Interruption of Everything was real and funny. I could totally relate to this novel, although I love all of Terry Macmillian Novels, I thought it could have had a tad bit more drama. But her friends were definitely off the hook! So funny! Also, Marilyn talked so much about Gordon in the novel, I wanted to know more about their relationship. Terry did a good job with this book. A must read if you are a mother or a caretaker!"
4,Terry is Back,"I loved this book, although I am not middle aged I can understand a lot of the things Marylin was going through. Her husband was a piece of ~bleep~, her mother-in law was way too funny and her sister was sad. I did not like the way the book ended, but I can live with it. This book was a very fast read and will have you laughing out loud."
3,Not Ms. McMillian's best,I usually love this author and anything she does but this novel made me distracted and tired. There was definitely a lot going on in this one and it was a little hard to focus on the main thread. Still love the author but this is definitely not at the top if my list.
4,Always on the giving end.,"I felt like this book really captured the essence of always giving and never getting in return by following the trials and tribulations in the life of Marilyn, a yuppie upper class sister living in Fresno, CA. Also, Ms. McMillan clearly describes how selfish family can be when it comes to your needs and wants. I am sure alot of readers could relate to the issues raised by her book,including stand up for yourself and don't always put your needs last.Her girlfriends were tremendous support systems and I loved the way her characters seemed to come right off the pages especially her three children. It was also interesting to see how she developed the class differences between her adopted sister Joy and herself. I thought the ending was a disappointment but overall, the book was great summer reading."
2,Terry can do better than this,"I've read several Terry McMillan books and I must say that by far this is the worst. Lots of the characters are left undeveloped and the reader has to assume alot of what Terry is trying to say. This book is definitely written for the 40+ age group, so if you're not there yet, you will not ""get it""."
3,ReaDefing Me,"This was not one of Terry's best books, but it was a good read. I belive the story was good story, but she introduced a lot of characters in the book that she never developed. Especially that ex-husband, What was that about?"
2,The Lord Of The BoRings trilogy finally gets complete!,"Metalhead, Killing Ground, Lionheart. When we will get a Saxon album that we can at least remember one song after a few listenings... Since Unleash the Beast, I did not hear anything from Saxon that strikes me as being original, a** kicking and worth listening.Lionheart is repetitive, uninspired by any Saxon standards. Not a single song strikes me with a WOW, they all seem the same, just like that Black Sabbath's album Forbidden. Ok, I agree it's better than albums from many overrated Euro-bands, but when you think this band released albums like Crusader and Solid Ball of Rock, Lionheart is BAD.That does not mean Saxon is dead. They still rock live and they have enough songs to do an awesome live set. But my impression is that Saxon is becoming like Deep Purple: always an excuse for the band to release new live dics and compilations, and for us to take the dust out of our old classic masterpieces and pray together for the next CD."
5,best debut album i have heard,"In a year of great albums, this is not only the best i heard from 2002, but the best debut album i have ever heard. a long, wandering, wonderful trip through relationships and life with the bad AND the good, his short songs leave you wanting more, his long ones make you shake your head in disbelief. This is truly a triumph, an absolute victory for real independent music, done by one very uncompromising, incredible artist; he shows that whatever tastemakers think we want, the work of one driven soul working alone always gives the very best."
3,there are some hidden gems,"true, this album is a mess.GOOD:some songs showcase his incredible talents such as ""look good in leather"", ""upstarts"", ""6 seconds"" and ""when i find time"".BAD:there are some material that are just hard to stomach like ""b*tch i'm broke"" and ""war between the sexes"". also songs like ""boylife in america"" and ""daddy's baby"" would have been good songs but pulled down by the unnecessary profanity.it also sad to see him waste good beats like ""batman vs blackman"" and ""setting up the system"".you can easily pick out 10-12 songs and make your own ""masterpiece"". it's too bad he didn't do it for us"
2,"a cd's worth of decent material, the rest is filler","not a total waste of money, just disappointing. its no masterpiece."
3,Good but...,"Loved the voice, loved the funky rhythms, loved the songwriting, loved the low-fi approach, hated the casual misogyny of some tracks, or is it ironic?"
3,Cody takes the nu-soul back to 4-track recording,A very nice cd with a terence trend d'Arby kinda voice. and some great funny lyrics. Yes it might take some getting used to and not all the song have great potiential(like the Seed also done with the Roots). But many many do. This is a must have for the neo soul-lovers.i love the way he kept the sound raw by recording it at home. This makes the songs a lot stronger than all the mixing and molding that most nowadays modern artist need to compensate their lack of talent. I'm pretty convinsed that mr. Chesnutt has plenny .... looking forward to the next album.
4,Can't Get No Betta,"and I fear Cody probably won't... was truly gifted and inspired, can't help but feel he'll never reach this high again. He refused to perform any songs that might contradict his new spirituality ...even censored himself on ""Look Good in Leather"" and ""The Seed"" and pretty much preached about his faith in God the whole night.That being said, this album is truly inspired and while a bit raunchy at times, feels very personal and comes from some place most folks can't tap into, mixing a lot of soul and angst. The angst might be gone going forward, though, as it doesn't seem to agree with Cody's God. Loved the show, but it sure wasn't what I was expecting."
3,Hitchcock's Hardys,"Hichcock's The Three Investigators mimic the Hardy boys in this clone of the famous mystery series.Written in the sixties, this mystery takes us to a Los Angeles junkyard where the boy investigators must literally get ahead...a plaster head,actually, with a mysterious Indian ruby buried inside. A Hindu temple in India is robbed years before and a long trail leads the investigators to a mysterious Indian businessman and a winding freeway of leads and gumshoe adventures under the hot southern California sun.The plot is somewhat contrived, relies on weak leads, an improbable interpretation of a letter and the chance location of a moonbeam to be solved. When the leads are solved, the moon's light reveals the ruby and the end of the story. Amen!Good escape though for an aging baby boomer."
5,the flavor,talk about songs and grooves that don't let up? quite a few of these songs are stone cold classics period. these are the kind of songs you can party to and bump your head non stop. old school is where its always at because the material never gets old. great selections.
5,A Beautiful Work of Art,"I bought a copy of the Alice pop-up book for my little girl as a birthday present. When we opened it I was amazed! This is no cheesy, kiddie pop-up book, it's definitely a masterful work of art. Each page has beautiful pop-ups that swirl, move, and are delightful. Robert Sabuda is a master and I have since bought two others (the ""Wizard of Oz"" is a treasure). They can be a bit pricey at $25, so buy them here to get the best deals. My daughter loves all of them, including Cookie Count, because of the movement and colors. I love to open each page because it's like unwrapping a beautiful gift."
5,Robert Sabuda is a Master author/illustrator.,"Sabuda's books are like none others. His classic tales actually spring forth from the page bringing the stories to life, delighting readers young and old."
5,Eye candy!,The ultimate pop up book. If anyone ever sees a more eloborate and spectacular pop-up book LET ME KNOW.
2,Pop-up magic,"I have always loved the story of ""Alice"" and I rave over the pop-up illustrations of Sabuda. This book however fell short. The story was poorly edited and the artwork was below par for Sebuda. If you really want a fun Sebuda book ""The Wizard of OZ,"" is terrific. Your children will have you reading over and over."
1,not worth the money,"i've seen the same style cutters on ebay for much less. Its not worth paying this much for a machine thats made in china. Look on Ebay, you can find some for way cheaper, just with a different name."
3,Brother Intellifax 2820,So far I have been very satisfied with the 2820 Intellifax. It performs better than any fax machine I have had.Don
5,My experience with Brother Intellifax 2820 Fax and Copier,"My Brother Intellifax arrive just two weeks ago but I am extremely pleased with the performance of the machine. It has all the bells andwhistles, and more, that you need for a home office machine. It replaceda ten-year old Brother fax which was adequate but slow. The 2820 is remarkably fast."
3,"Decent low cost fax, best for moderate use, Its a fax","We use 4 of these in a medical office. With high volume, they break about every 6-8 months. We keep buying them, however, as we always have exchangeable parts, and there really isn't a lot of competition in the fax machine market. These are better built than the other models we've tried.We tried the 4100 Business Class machines from brother, found they didn't offer that much additional benefit, and were huge. These fit well on a counter, can double as a USB laser printer, and get the job done."
2,could be better,"This fax works great for small offices or homes. It is very fast and gives you a confirmation to let you know the fax went through. The only problem I have with it is it curls the paper so it is impossible to make copies or scan documents that come in. Also, any fax over 2 pages long gets jumbled up and ends up all over the floor."
2,Not Worth It,"I thought a lens attachment for my camera would really help, but the lenses offered aren't that great. I don't think it's worth the money for this plus any additional lenses."
4,"A pleasant, minor fantasy.","""Are All the Giants Dead?"" is a very fun story peppered with clever in-jokes for those who love fairy tales.Young James, who is more interested in science fiction than fairy tales, is wisked away in his sleep by Mildred, an ethereal storyteller who takes him off to a magical kingdom. This place turns out to be the land of ""happily ever after"" where all the legendary heroes and heroines of the past live in leisure and contentment long after their stories have ended. James, though, finds one or two stories left unresolved, and so his adventure begins.Mary Norton's prose is crisp and well paced, and her characters are very well drawn. The story, however, may have turned out more memorable had the plot become a bit more involved. The villian of the story, for instance, is glimpsed only briefly at the tale's end.And of course Brian Froud's 8-10 black and white illustrations are fantastic."
2,The daughter made me want to puke,"I couldn't believe how self-centered, rude, and obnoxious Olivia, the daughter, was! Please...if I had ever thought to speak to my mother that way, the last thing she would do is ""fight the urge to hug me""....I wasn't expecting this to be a heavy book, which obviously it wasn't, but it wouldn't have hurt the author to make ONE character likeable. March is a wimp, the daughter spoiled, and the son and father couldn't even pretend to be interested in March's college life? I guess I can see why she was so wimpy considering everyone in her family was lazy, selfish, and rude."
2,"The bird liked it, but we didn't.","Our Alexandrine isn't a picky guy, and he certainly munched on this contentedly. My first clue that maybe this was going to be a one-time only purchase- the much touted easy open zip top seal died the second time I tied to open the bag. To add insult to injury, I think the bird food at Amazon sits in the warehouse for awhile; it was full of seed moths! I ended up throwing it out before we'd used 1/4 of the bag. So if you decide to bit the bullet and buy this, keep a bag clip handy and either store it in the freezer, or invest in some of those pantry moth pest traps."
1,Bait and Switch,"I was surprised and disappointed that when I reordered ""Paraket Gourmet Diet"" food, I was instead sent a lesser, non-gourmet version ""Parakeet Diet"" described in the other one-star review. This is known as ""bait-and-switch"" and it is dishonest."
1,Nutritionally inappropriate choking hazard in a bag,Guinea pigs are not seed eaters and do not need the artificial colors or other nonsense added to this food to make unsuspecting buyers think there's something healthy about it. Chock full of choking hazards for guinea pigs. Stick to a quality brand like Oxbow.
2,Guinea Pig Wasted most of it,"Sorry Hartz, but I think you missed the boat on this Guinea Pig Food. Mine knocked most of it out of her food bowl, and I ended up throwing it away. She always pushes the food aside that she does not like, and only eats what she does like. So, I would say that 3/4 of this food went to the trash, which means this is a waste of money for our Guinea Pig. While she eats the compressed alfalfa pieces, that is about the only thing she liked in the mix. The bag only lasted us two weeks, because I ended up throwing most of it in the trash. A typical bag of Guinea Pig food, in this same volume weight, lasts us about six weeks. You do the math. I generously gave you 2 stars for the alfalfa. But, I certainly find NOTHING 'gourmet' about this food."
4,my bird loves it,Hartz Bonanza Parakeet Diet 4-Pound Supply....MY BIRD LOVED THE BIRD FOOD.WHEN I GOT IT AND PUT IT IN HIS FEEDER HE WENT ABSOLUTLY NUTS OVER THE MANY DIFFERENT SEEDS INSIDE.FIRST THING MY BIRD WENT FOR WAS THE BITS OF FRUIT AND THE OAT GROATS IN PARTICULAR.HE LOVED IT ALL BUT THAT WAS HIS FAVORITE PART OF THE PRODUCT....SINCERELY DARRELL
2,How to Cook in a Dutch Oven,"For technique this is a great video, for entertainment this is the WORST!!! Very drab, mono-tone."
4,Sunnywood 3854 Wood Cribbage Domino Set,I purchased this item and mailed it to a family member serving overseas in the military. He was amazingly pleased with the cribbage board and that all items could be kept inside.
1,Don't buy it!,"I have a dual boot system, and neither 98 or win 2000 like this card. I have tried everything to get it working. Has IRQ problems, for no apparent reason, I riped out all my cards and installed one by one, still nothing. Spend a little more, get a little more. I will post a follow up if Tech Support is able to help me. If you see no follow up by me, go with another card."
4,Adult Comedy,Ron White is great he makes me laugh so hard. Although not for everyone its a great way to lift your spirits.
5,The White Night,"I had one of the best times of my life watching Ron White in person. I drove 4 hours to see him, and believe me, it was well worth the drive. The routines on this CD are the same ones I heard last night. I laughed until my sides ached. I guarantee he'll have the same effect on you."
1,Not funny at all,It is a good thing I heard it at friend's house. This is not worth your money. This is like some random alcoholic guy standing up and speaking about his day. That is boring. If you want comedy listen to Dice Clay or Lewis Black but not this lame and boring half asleep drunk.
1,HUGE FAN!!!,"I'm a HUGE fan of Ron White, but don't waste your money! I pre-ordered this because I was so excited about a new video. I watched it immediately and was so disappointed. He was so laid back I almost fell asleep, I kept waiting for him to get into his groove but it never happened. I really feel like this video was quickly made only to make Ron White more money. His last joke was an OLD JOKE that wasn't his funniest joke either. Big disappointment and I hope someone from his staff reads this review and gets Ron off his duff and make a video with NEW and FUNNY stuff. We all know he can do it ~ so let us have it."
5,Great book on non-dualism,Great book on non-dualism as are books by Ken Wilber and Eckhart Tolle. They all agree for the most part except on the basic question of why we are here.
4,looks like a real rock,"We got this rock to cover up two 4"" drain pipes sticking up about 5 inches above grade. The pipe caps are right next to each other and they're next to a deck we built. We put several slightly smaller real rocks next to the fake one and the fake one blends in perfectly. The texture and finish of it is quite natural - slightly rough, and a natural color. No one has realized it was a fake until we point it out to them. I am very pleased with the look of the rock."
2,Okay but not too exciting,I felt like I was in a time warp. Most of this stuff is taught in a Psych 101 class.
1,Not Worth It....,This game is not worth the price that it is advertise. it is stupid and boring. don't waste your money.
1,A world of trouble,"Don't buy this! I used this on a Mac. It worked OK when I just had a couple of devices on it, but when I added a Wi-Fi USB adapter, it caused frequent computer crashes on startup, loss of Internet connection, and freezing of my mouse. I thought it was the adapter's fault, but after reading the reviews here, I bought a D-Link USB hub to replace it. Haven't had a problem since!"
1,What made it quit working?,"I wondered why my printer stopped working, why my Palm wouldn't connect, why my camera wouldn't connect. Finally narrowed it down to my Belkin USB hub. If it doesn't work nothing else does. Checked the reviews and they'r all bad. Belkin, you've had your last chance with me. Bye. Bye."
5,Easy as Pie,"I opened the package, plugged the hub into my computer and into the AC outlet, and it worked! As easy as that - no software to load, no books to read, no networking jargon to learn. All products should be this easy to use. If I had a complaint at all, it would be that the data cable that comes with the hub, used to connect the hub to the USB port on the PC, is less than 18 inches long. In my case, I took the new 6' cable I had purchased with my printer and used it to connect the hub, placing the hub next to the printer so that I could then use the short cable between the hub and the printer. USB is indeed a great option and this hub makes it possible to operate my digital camera and both my printers from a single USB port."
1,At Least I'm Not Alone,"Seven months after installation, my Belkin 4-Port hub died. To judge by the reviews posted here, this happens far more often than it should. Windows XP informed me the Belkin hub had ""mal-functioned,"" and if reconnecting it didn't work should ""replace the device."" So I did.Hopefully, my new D-Link 4-port hub will last longer. At least the connections for the power and CPU are located on the back of the D-Link. For some unfathomable reason they're located on the front of the Belkin, so the cords were always pulling the box to the side."
4,good,works as advertised. A common flaw in these hubs is the power cord exits the same side as the usb ports so can interfere a bit. If you don't use them for constantly pjugging and replugging it isn't an issue.
2,worked fine for a while until it randomly stopped,"This worked fine for over a year (unpowered) and then one day it just stopped. It hasn't worked since. The LEDs don't even light up. I tried plugging it in (the adapter this comes with is huge and very heavy and unwieldy), but that didn't work either. I'm going to switch to a different brand and a powered hub. This is the only Belkin product I've ever had a bad experience with. I would definitely not buy another Belkin USB hub."
1,MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR BUDGET,"I'm returning this without a trial because of your restrictive policy on unopened items.After reading that on the shipping sheet I reviewed all other reviews of the product,enough of which cautioned against using it that I wouldn't risk it on my new IMac nor forfeit the return."
4,Powered or unpowered,"I have both the 4-port and 7-port Belkin USB hubs. Both have worked as advertised for more than three years. Today the 7-port hub gave up so it is time to buy a new one.Regarding others comments about the 4-port hub not being powered, there is a switch on the side that allows you to switch between powered and unpowered ports. Why you would want to do this I don't know. If your hub seems not to be powered check the switch."
1,"Worked fine, then died","This hub worked fine for over a year, and then stopped working completely (lights don't go on)."
3,took over a month to get to Hawaii,I haven't actually had a chance to use it. I almost forgot that I ordered it. It has taken over a month to get here and there was no indication that it was going by slow boat when I ordered it.Ask me again in a month after I've used it.
3,Longegivity questionable,"My touch 'n hold crapped out after 2 years. It froze in the open position and I had to dismantle it to close the door. Pressing the control button had no effect. It wasn't worth the extra money. I'll now stick with a ""plain vanilla"" closer from Lowes."
5,A Wonderful Way to hold the door open,"Great for bringing in groceries, or holding the door open while you assist someone with a walker or wheelchair. Easy installation. Easy operation."
2,"Product is good, dealer was bad","The Interceptor for Acura is a great product but the vender I used had the worst communication possible. I recieved my product as it was advertised and found out I had a different model car for the product. I then went to send the product back to dealerstore.com and it has been over 3 weeks of poor communication. After contacting dealerstore.com with the error in my purchase, they promised me a return slip within 3 days. I finally got the return slip after 2.5 weeks of phone calls and convincing the company I did not want the product because I ordered the wrong model. After I have put the product back in the mail, It has been a month long process. I recommend the product but I don't recommend using dealerstore.com"
4,Good slipper.,"I bought these slippers several weeks ago and took another reviewer's advice and ordered them a size larger than my shoe. They fit fine with about 1/2"" to 3/4"" space at the big toe. Due to the design (and my wide foot) my toes don't travel forward, and my foot doesn't travel inside the slipper . My normal shoe size is a 14 EEEEE and I ordered these as 15 EEE. The slippers were a bit stiff when I got them but got soft in a couple of weeks of wearing. I'm wearing them now, and they feel fine."
4,"Not superb, but serviceable","I like this album, liked it when it was vinyl. It's not especially cohesive, nor is it particularly imaginative.Sweet Caroline, Grass Won't Pay No Mind, and Brother Love are among Neil's finest tracks. As for the rest of the record, it's fairly boilerplate stuff, valuable, if I'm being honest, only to those who grew up on Neil's music or who have grown to love him over the last forty years.I don't mean to damn with faint praise. It's just that this is a very good collection of songs, and nothing more."
2,There might be an excellent game here...,"...but you'll most likely never find out given the sorry state of programming it shipped in. Gamers and diehards might feel punished by the crippling performance issues and frequent bugs, but the real victim here is another formerly stellar franchise circling the drain as hopes of a future sequel end up buried by poor reviews by nearly all major publications and review sites.Avoid until there's a great deal of evidence that a ""miracle patch"" has been released."
3,"Quick review, but lacking some important clinical relationships","Overall if you know anatomy decently, this is a quick and simple review. I was able to finish it in one day, and its a fairly interesting read as it is written in a way that you can read it, as opposed to a lot of newer books that have bullet points or are really straight outlines of a topic.However there are some important anatomical relationships that are missing, such as perforated ulcers (stomach and duodenum) and how they are likely to damage the splenic artery or gastroduodenal artery, respectively. There are a few other cases where some shockingly important details are left out, but overall it is a solid read.Great coverage of the brachial plexus and upper limb nerve injuries makes it a good refresher for boards or a (cough, cough, remediation) exam where these topics are super high yield."
4,read for step 1 if time allows,"this is a nice little book to just skim through if you have when studying for step 1.it has nice tables and easy to read format that makes stuff stick. skim through it if you have time, if you think you want have time or you find yourself running out of time, then read first aid as an alternative. Even if you decide to read this book, u shouldnt read it alone supplement it with first aid.i supplemented this book with first aid and i made 229/95 on my step 1."
2,i hope there is something better out there,"it just lacks too many information, and when you need to look for something you often only waste your time because it is not there. in the board qusetions they do not ask you what you do know which is what this book tells you, but what you do not remember cause it is a stupid detail that you forgot, and you will hardly find it here"
1,I did not like this DVD,I was very disappointed in this DVD. I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout. Most of the exercises had 8 counts total. That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape. I did not find it challenging. I am an intermediate level exerciser. I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up. I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow. I give it a thumbs down.
3,Good and Bad,"The Marmot Vertical Soft Shell Jacket is a great jacket in many ways, but fails in one way - which is why I returned it.It has excellent material thickness and design. It is superior to many jackets in its design. Great length. Sizing is excellent. It permits layers without discomfort. Form followed function nicely.But the down side - and it is seen in some other jackets. The collar is all but a waste. You can leave it very open and hence have a very exposed neck; or you can zip it to the top which is very uncomfortable (not useable). The collar should be an inch shorter in the front, and more flexible. That would make this a perfect jacket. Many soft shell jackets get it right. This one is not useable.I would love to see that one improvement. But I guess that does not help me here."
3,Not what I was expecting,"This ""book"" is more like a brochure.. or one of those checkout cookbooks. It does have some basic tips in it but I surely wouldn't pay more than $5 for it!!"
3,Good concept album...needs more metal,"I first heard the track Unholy Warcry and decided I had to buy this album, if, for nothing else, just for that one song (and of course, for the amazing cover art).However, although Unholy Warcry is amazing and there are few other tracks that are great, this album does not have anywhere near enough power metal on it. It is full of medieval sound effects, Christopher Lee's narrations, and little folk tunes done on the flute. This would all be well and good if there wasn't so much of it!Replace all that stuff with some good Rhapsody power metal and you've got an amazing album. It is the sort of album that would be great if one could set certain tracks to permanently be skipped.So, although there is great variety and some really good power metal, there is also a lot of boring stuff of the likes I have described. I would recommend this album because it is, if anything, a masterpiece and a great and epic work that tells a story of, go figure, dragons and knights."
1,The Most Boring Album ever!!!!!!!,"Yes,please do call it quits,this album is crap.Every song is so boring and they have that Lord Of The Rings guy on this album.The intro's are way to long and then all of a sudden during middle of songs there is talking.There first album Legendary Tales is even worst then this crap album.I don't like Fabio Lione, the only time he was okay at singing was when he was with Labyrinth formally known as Joe Terry,I'm glad he left Labyrinth because Roberto Tiranti(Rob Tyrant)is way,way better.If you have not heard this album or anything by Rhapsody DO NOT BUY ANY OF THERE ALBUMS."
2,Wouldn't Recommend,Ordered these because I thought they would be a stylish way to have my spices on the counter. The tubes are too narrow and hard to fill. I would't get again
4,Great little rack but one tube was broken,I'd have given this 5 stars. Except one of the tubes was chipped on the top. Had already filled most of them so just decided to not send it back. Great concept though
4,Rugged and Spacious,"Nice bag, loads of space. Stands up to teenagers 50#s of books without complaint. The clasps on the buckles seem a bit flimsy, but they haven't broken yet."
1,Too narrow.,I am not sure if it is mainly the fault of the liners or the wax. The liner are more narrow than what I am used to. They pull the wax off the skin when putting the liners on.
1,Liners for feet Waste Of Money,Too small and way too expensive for cheap cheap bags. Don't waste your money. This company really overcharges for these.
4,Rodboomboom never read the book!!!,"As a professor of Religion, I have used this book to teach many classes. Dr. Hunter just came to my school to lecture on some of his methods. Dr. Hunter has been noted as the number one Church Growth and Evangelism lecturer in the United States. This book is very helpful...but challenging to read. Many of my students have found some parts hard to understand because of the language he uses. Definitely worth the read....(Oh and Trust me the Theology is Right on Target with the scripture)"
2,not very good,"the item was not worth $3.99 on wraping. also it was not really in good shape. i had to fix some parts of the item before I gave it for gift. Also since the wraping was horrible, I had to unwrapped the item and wrap it myself."
1,cheap looking,"This jewellry looks like something that a gum-ball machine would dispense. A five year old might be impressed, everyone else is left thinking""this doesn't look anything like the picture"" and wondering just how mis-leading your advertisments are allowed to be. The clasp is small and flimsy, and the roping texture of the band evident in the picture is non-existant."
1,Hard Time,"This book is very biased. Hargrove gives a bad name to martial arts practicioners all over the world. He was essentially ""excommunicated"" if you will from the association of Shorin-Ryu Shorinkan by the Grandmaster himself, Shugoro Nakazato. Hargrove, however, still claims ties with him and continues to collect dues and monies from members of his new NASKA association, keeping the money for himself.Don't waste your money on this."
2,"Repetitive, boring","Too long, too repetitive and almost no dialogue creates an extended agony that sometimes might be confusing."
2,Don't order through Amazon.....cheaper in stores!,"This is pretty much a rubber toothbrush. Exactly what it looks like. I was bummed to see that the same exact one was only 1.99 at Babies r us, which is usually the more expensive option. It isn't alot of money, it is just that Amazon takes pride to offer lower prices, and I was assuming that mose basic items like this were competitive. I learned my lesson to relaly look around before I place an order with Amazon!"
2,Too many unanswered questions,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer and state that this is, in fact, the best SQL Server 7.0 book currently on the market. Unfortunately, this is mostly due to the even poorer quality of its competitors. While the discussion of features that already existed in 6.5 is quite exhaustive, the coverage of 7.0 improvements and innovations (believe me, there are many) is superficial and leaves you with too many unanswered questions.If you are completely new to SQL Server, this book may be the most adequate choice, but its claim to be for intermediate to advanced users is overstated.MCSE/MCDBA candidates: I know you are desperately waiting for study materials to pass the 7.0 exams, but this isn't it, either."
2,not quite there...,"Ok I'm going to try to make this review as short and sweet as I can. This book is missing A LOT of things. The plot was INCREDIBLY weak. It had potential but didn't come close to making it. The main characters are able to fall in love with each other after only meeting 2 MAYBE 3 times. And each other those times was about 15 minutes max. The story was incredibly hard to believe. I don't know about you but friendship can only be pushed so far. And the secondary character Lavinia pushes it way to far mistreating our ""heroine"" of the story. But Freddie (heroine) keeps coming back for more. And in the end when it is proved that Freddie was right all along there's not even a big apology scene. So overall this really isn't that great of a book. I don't recommend it at all unless you are Really desparate for something to read. But do read some of this authors other books. She isn't normally this disappointing. This wasn't my first of her and won't be my last either."
4,Pricey but worth it.,"I bought my Mantis used from a local equipment dealer for nearly the same price as this attachment set! But that was enough of a savings to me to justify the price of this Aerator/Dethatcher combo, since I didn't spend $300+ on the Mantis.Yes, this is expensive, but it makes more sense than buying the Aerator and Dethatcher seperately. The Dethatcher worked great, pulling up about 8 paper lawn bags worth of thatch from a half acre lawn that was well cared for.The only downside is the noise generated by the tines slapping against the shields. This might be because my Mantis is older and used, so the shields might be bent, but either way, it's noisy.The Aerator works too, but since the path it cuts is smaller than the Dethatcher, it's much more time consuming.Very easy to use both and not destroy your yard. I don't know what professionals charge for this service, but I'm sure a few uses of this combination more than pays for itself. If you enjoy your Mantis, this is a worthy tool."
4,Good Ball,This is a good weight for girls - not too heavy. The outer grip is a bit abrasive but not too bad.
5,Noir Masterpiece,"A friend recommended this book to me sometime ago, with rave reviews, but I put off reading it. It turned out to be a rare treat. Before returning to Italy, I spent a number of years in North Beach, and Stansberry has it right, the big and the small, from the idiosyncratic spellings of the Italian American names to the community's nostalgia for a time that never truly existed. He understands the neighbhorhood--and the people who lived there (or did once upon a time) and the underlying murder story is both suspenseful and lyric in the fashion of the noir writers of the forty's and fifties. You won't get Michael Conoley style thrill a minute here, but Stansberry is ultimately a better writer, with a more subtle agenda, and the book is truly gripping. Among affeciondos of the noir genre, this book has the reputation as a small canvas masterpiece--and in my opinion this is a reputation well-deserved. My only question: When are we going to get more from books from this talented writer?"
5,Sweetest Taboo,"Ms. Guinn, is not only a voice long over due in the literary world. Masterfully she deals with the Social dilemmas we face everyday, collectively and individually. Though the webs we weave in our lives, may sometimes may be tangled. We often are confronted with what is morally, or socially ethical. Sometimes the answer is simply one's needs, over riding one's wants. Besides, when it comes to love, we go with our feelings, not our cognitive mind. This novel is pure ""Genius"" at it's best. My hope is that one day this will be a required reading for High school Seniors and College English courses. Right along with Hawthorne, Longfellow, Steinbeck; Guinn epitomizes the word ""Imagination,"" as she takes the reader to that place within, that place we all think of as our own. Uh oh! Is that ""Pulitzer"" I hear? Tangled Web is a must read. . .Because we all need to heal."
2,I Gave This away,"The numbers are huge, the lighting is also better than other handhelds I've had but if you accidentally switch it off, your game would be lost. I carry a large clttered handbag. When I rush out in the morning, I drop the game in it. There have been many times when I save the game only to come back to it and see that the button was switched to off. It became annoying so I gave it away."
2,Disappointed,"Why bother to change something that works fine? I had one of these a couple of years ago and loved it, but I lost it. I like to try to beat my own best time, so I depend on the sounds and the visual layout. This new one doesn't have the bolder lines on the 9-box grid, so the appearance of it in the photo is deceptive. Without the boxes delineated, it is slower to work and harder on the eyes. I have gone back to using the smaller model which still has those thicker lines between the boxes. I feel like I wasted the extra money to order this one."
3,"Turtles, Dinosaurs and Rats","Shredder and Krang discover a Dinosaur reserve at the earth's core and plot to steal their life source, an energy crystal, to repower the Technodrome, drill to the surface, and comence w/ world domina.. blah blah yada yada and of course the turtles are ready to stop 'em. In the next episode the Ratking makes his debut and plots to control Splinter and make him a part of his rat army."
2,Not worth the time,"I checked this book out from the library and was glad I had not paid for it. I read the entire book and only wrote down two ideas. Most of the information is common sense, and much of it I had already read in some of my other wedding planners. If you're still convinced you need this book, go to the library. You can always write down any ideas you like, and once you get married, you won't need the book again."
3,Nicole K.,"The book has many good ideas in it, but at times it feels like the book is portraying the average wedding to cost $20,000+ and in reality most weddings don't cost that. It makes the reader feel like they are unable to have a wonderful wedding without spending a fortune."
2,Horrid,"A couple good songs. Not very inventive, nothing exciting. I was really into them before they came out with the full length, but the CD as a whole is too polished and sounding like every other band.The songs just drag on and nothing seems to stand out. They are NOT like Thursday. I don't know where this came from. They sound more like Yellowcard trying to be hard.Avoid this CD at all costs. And if you can, avoid the new CD also. It's worse then this and this is pretty bad."
5,amazon ripes people off,2 days ago this cd was 13.99 and now it just when up. the cd ius good buyt dont buy it from amazon
3,again?,"this genre is done. don't get me wrong, i love this genre...it's my guilty pleasure. but seriously, some of the lyrics in this genre are, um, how do you say...LAME and so done-before. but whenever i feel like doing 100 on the highway, nothing sounds better than a little Senses Fail, and now A Change Of Pace. I was in AZ at their cd release, and they put out a great performance! but again, i think anymore bands like this and they aren't going to go anywhere. because let's face it...how can you ""hide something obvious?"""
5,Don't miss--Here They Come,"Mr. Costello's debut work is beautifully illustrated and the story is witty. Although it is written for small children, my nine year old son enjoys reading it to my 4 year old daughter. The book is also being used in his fourth grade poetry class. I highly recommend it!"
1,WTF??? -5 STARS!!!,This DVD lasted about 15 minutes in my player before I ejected it and found a more useful purpose for it...A COASTER for my beer!
1,Worst coax ever,"I am a DTV installer... I was assigned a service call the other day, where the issue was intermittent ""searching for satellite signal"".The first thing I do at any service call is remove any ""Monster Cable"" I can find within the home. Even with CATV, Monster Cable is only good for creating issues with signal.To my surprise, I didn't find any. The dish was pointed correctly at the pole, and all the connections were good. I look down, and saw something that I did not even know existed...Underground Monster Cable! Ha... I couldn't believe it. Replaced it... everything works fine.People, do not waste your money on this stuff. This company only stays in business because they charge outrageous prices for the worst quality cable on the market."
2,Why so WHITE?,"I typically love the newfangled fancy pop-up books, but not this one, because it is missing an important part of what makes them great - COLOR. The text is the lyrics to a spectacular song, America the Beautiful. And the seven pop-ups are of pretty cool U.S. landmarks: the Golden Gate Bridge (partly orange), a farmhouse in the Great Plains (the silver coated fan atop the barn really spins), Mount Rushmore (my least favorite of them all as the faces aren't really 3-D-ish), Mesa Verde, a riverboat on the Mississippi (silver ribbons on the wheel rods spin when the page is opened), the Capitol (Washington Monument forever bent), and the Statue of Liberty (this last page has a mini-book containing four smaller popups and the words to other verses). In summary, monochromatic monuments lack eye-appeal. Way better: Predators by Lucio and Meera Santoro, and The Amazing Pop-Up Geography Book by Kate Petty and Jennie Maizels."
4,WOW,"WOW! Sabuda does it again. I don't know how these books are mass produced. Amazing detail down to Abe Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, and the spinning wheels on the boat. Incredible.Only complaint is the everything is whitepaper, except the backgrounds. Would have liked to have seen color on the pop-ups like his other books."
5,Eye Opening!!!,How amazing God is when He reveils Himself through amazing writers like Rick Joyner. Looking forward to seeing how what I've learned through reading this book can be applied to my life to be more in God's purpose for my life.
5,Vital information for building a closer walk with the Father,This book is a confirmation of the vision that several prayer people have had. The body of Christ is being beat-up by the devil because of lack of revelation. This book is a wake up call to the serious Christian.
5,Just what the church needs to hear!,"I must admit that though I believe in the prophetic I am very leary of anything which claims to be prophecy. There are too many false prophets in the world today. In this book, however, Rick Joyner speaks the heart of God. This book spoke to me in a voice of conviction and confirmation. In this book Rick Joyner has brought to light many truths we need to accept in our spirtual walk and in the unity of the Church. Certainly not a replacement of God's word but definitely a worthwhile eye opener."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book, a blessing to my life and reallyhelped me to realize so many things that are actuallyhappening in the spiritual world, and we dontsee them, reed it with a Bible and i dont recomend thisbook for ""spiritual children"""
5,"Awesome - best book next to the Bible, itself!","Anything I can say here would only be echoing the sentiment of those reviews before me. It changed my life, and I, too, found myself on my knees with tears of conviction streaming down my face. I was so moved by this book that I bought five copies and gave them out to friends to circulated to others."
2,shipped on time,"I love the amped series, not so much the Live in LA, I turned it off in a few min, but all other amped videos keep your heart rate up and keep you moving and def have you seeing results.I love love love Billy Banks!!"
3,Primeras impresiones,"Recién empiezo a leer la guia, y en la página 2 del capítulo uno, hay una descripción general de los motores de 2 tiempos y de 4 tiempos. En este manual de motores Honda leo ""all engines covered in this manual are a two-stroke design"". Después de un error como este, uno queda un poco desconfiado con el resto de la información..."
2,Average,"I didn't find this book very helpful. What it refers to as ""advanced topics"" such as persistent storage and networking are basic concepts that aren't explained very clearly. Seems put together too quickly with only average coverage of j2me."
4,Only for thin stemmed glasses,"I can't really say much about it's function & durability. It seems extremely well made. The problem is we cannot use them, and unfortunately will have to return them. The spaces between the rods are too narrow for the wine glasses we would like to hang up. So check your stem diameter before ordering. These are exactly what we want........but wider. Would love to know where I can find the same thing but with wider spaces. I am giving it 4 stars because it is seems well made, nothing seems to be wrong with this product, just a sizing issue."
3,"A good read, but ""Hack"" is in over his head.","COL Hackworth knows how to see through the bull at the ground level and it shows. Unfortunately, this book shows the limits of his intelligence. While his assessment of the colossal screw-up at the ground level in Somalia is outstanding, his analysis of bigger picture issues shows how short-sighted he is. His criticism of Schwartzkopf during the Gulf War in particular completely misses some troublesome facts that Stormin' Norman had to deal with (a diverse coalition, logistics problems, pressure from Washington, etc). Hackworth is the kinda guy who makes a GREAT leader - at the lower levels. Despite his very high opinion of himself (seems to be reading too many press clippings), he would be a joke as a General."
3,Average - no where near as good as About Face,"The book is ok, but not great. About Face was excellent and I was expecting something more. While I did learn from this book, and it was a worthwhile read, there wasn't enough substance. There was a bit too much about Hackworths exploits in getting the interviews, and not enough analysis.The contents of the book could have been summarized in 25 pages. It wouldn't have been as entertaining but it would have been a much faster read.The book was an enjoyable read, but I wanted more analysis, and less story telling."
5,That every man be armed,"You can tell alot about the credibility of a book by reading the review of those who like it. You can tell even more by reading the review of those who dislike it. Obviously, ""a reader from the United States"" couldn't refute any of the ideas, and it struck a nerve with those amoung us who dislike our Constitution. Thanks, ""a reader from the United States"". This one will set prominently on my coffee table so all visitors can read the truth about our Second Amendment. Thanks in large part to the Second Amendment, we're still free to express our thoughts, isn't that right ""a reader from the United States""? I will definitely own this one!"
3,"Delivers as Advertised, but Lackluster Performance","GMP/FranklinCovey PlanPlus for Microsoft Outlook 3.0 works as promised. However, there were minor problems and annoyances that got me to uninstall the software. For example, the software relies heavily on the .NET framework, and this often caused lockups that required Outlook to be restarted. I liked the single view of my calendar, e-mail, tasks, and notes, but the interface needs updating to provide the look, feel, and funtionality of Outlook 2003. It was obviously designed around Outlook 2000 & 2002/XP, and therefore didn't harness some of the features of Outlook 2003. Overall, it was an average product that I give 3 stars."
1,Skip ahead to another,"First of all, i they sent my bag in a different color than i ordered. i would've returned but the color grew on me.while walking back and forth to my school about after a month of use it ripped by the strap.only thing in it was a laptop and maybe 1 or 2 books.this bag's alright for not carrying heavy things but as a schooling bag, stay away from this an the brand overall."
2,Remarkably Ineffective,"I was amazed by this product - not by how well it worked though. The steamer appears to be well built and does make plenty of steam, but is surprisingly ineffective against all the things it's supposed to be used for. Filth around sink drains, shower scum and even soap deposits remain after blasting them with a lot of steam. You would get your bath or kitchen details done in 1/3 the time with a brush.What a disappointing waste of time."
2,Don't buy.,I will be throwing this item away. From the moment the plug got close to my iPod it was static. If plugged in don't move your iPod or you will have loud static sounds. Sometimes you get what you pay for and this item was cheap. I do not recommend this item to anyone.
1,"Weak, fragile ---Buy something else","It might work OK for a while if you don't touch it or move it. I had two of these, both broke after a few months of what I'd call light use."
5,Cheap and works.,This is a basic cable. It works and it is cheap. There is not much else you can say about it.
4,Cheap crap that does the trick.,"Yep, it's a cable. It transmits the sound and doesn't break on day one. Exactly what you need to get sound out of your iPod and into your car."
3,Petmate Pet (Taxi ?) Fashion Kennel,"I bought two, one came from another place/factory because it the plastic is not as sturdy. There isn't a seatbelt slot, false advertising and not safe for people/pets in vehicles. One of my Yorkie's weighs about 8.5 lbs. and she fits and can stand up, but I wouldn't put any pet much heavier than her. I do like the fact when I put them together (easy), and put in comfy padding the dogs go into them on their own, and hang out. Lastly, I wouldn't advise taking them apart on a regular basis, as the fasteners are plastic."
4,pretty good.,"When I received my puppy he was given to me in a kennel similar to this one, same brand different color and size. When I ordered it I expected it to be a little bit bigger, due to the similar appearance of both products. I viewed both the small cage and medium cage and counted the circles on the side. The small kennel and the kennel my puppy came in looked identical and the medium one was a bit different. It was a little disappointing that it ended up being smaller then my dogs original kennel he was still able to fit in the new kennel comfortably, it is pretty small but so is my dog weighing in at only 8 pounds. As for quality of the product his original kennel looked like it was around for awhile and the new one is very sturdy only problem is the plastic nubs on the opening latches fell off."
3,Good for the price but make sure this is what you want,"If you just want a little kennel, this is a good option. It seems a bit flimsy and it is not big enough for big animals. Otherwise is good to transport little animals. More than enough for my little cat."
4,good carrier,"We used this carrier to transport our two cats (about 13 pounds each). They both fit into the carrier and still had enough space to curl up or walk around a little without stepping on each other. The size was perfect. My only gripe is that you definitely can't pick the carrier up by the handle when there's any weight in the carrier. I did this and one of the clamps popped open. But if you always pick it up by the sides and bottom, then you should be fine."
2,They call this a book???????,"I bought ""The Caller"", ""Halloween Hunt"", and ""The Hearse"" all 3 by Laymon. They are good stories, but what a rip off. Caller and hearse are only 27 pages long and halloween hunt is 60, but these are not the same size as paperback books, they are the same size as small church pamphlets, I was really mad when I got them. If you put them into a regular size paper back and made the font size normal instead of large, they would be probably be only about 2 pages long. So unless you just want to collect everything by Laymon, I recomend against these small fastback books."
4,Great Book!,"This book was great! I was kind of dissapointed that the Kentucky Derby won't be in this book or the next. I found the attitude of Melanie was sometimes a bit to strong. One thing I don't understand is why the author(who is great, by the way) would even think of putting the idea of racing Star again before the Derby. Like hum...let's see he just came back from Californa and placed in the Sanata Anita Derby and Chris wants to race him again? Well it's okay. She get's what she wants right?This is a great book. Four Stars!"
1,Not as pictured.,"Sadly, this puzzle is not of the same quality suggested by the picture. The alligator does not have a ridged back, and overall, the pieces are not painted in their entirety like other Melissa & Doug chunky puzzles. It looks like a cheap, unfinished knock-off. Each piece has what appears to be an adhesive image on the surface, and the rest of the puzzle piece is bare wood (particle board). I'm so disappointed."
5,Intelligent choice!,"If you have a child that is under age of 1 you should be consider buying this product, why? you may ask... let me tell you this puzzle is very educational with animal print and very colorful for a child is developing visual sense. Quality is excellent, it is well made of wood and piece of puzzle doesn't chip like some other competitors products. I really like when each individual piece of puzzle can stand alone as a animal figure. I would recommend this product to parents whom is looking for a great toy for children or as a gift. Two tumbs up!!!"
5,"Tricky, but good!","We have the Melissa and Doug farm animal puzzle also, but this one is a little trickier than that one. The safari animals are a little tougher to get into their spots (the giraffe, alligator and ostrich especially) so this was a good step-up puzzle for my one-year-old. We use it to help her learn her animals."
4,puzzle and toy,I love this beautiful puzzle. The kids like to play with the animals and they stand on their own.
5,colorful fun,"I gave this to my 2- year- old granddaughter as part of her birthday gifts. It brought many smiles as she lifted the colorful pieces, named the animals, and placed them back in the appropriate spaces. I know it will last her a long time- very well made."
3,Too hard if you cant use two hands,OK let me start by saying im disabled and generaly real time on rpgs is not that big of a issue ive been playing rpgs since the late 80s and rarely have diffculty but this game as other reiewers have said has terrible ai so i spent all my time playing with potions not only that but you cant actually use your best spical attacks without buton taps and in real time thes hard enough i have thought about starting over but then i think to myself the ai is not helpful so why bother i mean its abilitty system is like ff 12 which isnt a bad thing nice costumsion and all thatthe auto maps arent really helpful either in certain areas i have been stuck in the prsion for ages now because my chaters arent high enough level its redculious i move i die power levering should be a choice not a requirment UGH
1,Don't Make 'em Like They Used To,"They don't hold a charge. Switches break. The new version with different style case and labelled ""China"" are worthless. I've happily used several of the old version daily for 5 years, but the new ones I've bought are poor quality, and I will no longer buy Dorcy."
1,Dorcy spot light is garbage,This spotlight is garbage. It is not worth $5.00 More like 100 candle power at best and focus is horrible. I wasted $25.00 on this piece of junk.
5,Outstanding Biographies,I was able to relate to several of the stories about these courageous women. A great book. This book is perfect for any woman. I am a cancer survivor and really related to C.J. Whitcomb's story. Renee Bondi's story amazed me. Her ability to continue a full life after becoming a quadriplegic warmed my heart. All of the stories are inspirational. Thank you Alexis Powers!
4,Good book,"This is an excellent book. It really teaches children coping strategies when they are sad, in a very nice way. The book is in excellent condition when I received it, however, there is some sticky stuff on the book jacket, which is hard to get rid of. I really would like to keep this book for a long time to read to my children, so this is a minus."
4,travel chair,"We purchased this to use while we were travelling. It is very compact and fits many different styles and size of chairs.Our granddaughter is quite small so it is not something I would have felt comfortable leaving her in if she was not attended at all times, asI think if she would have been very active and mobile the potential for her to fall out of it was there."
4,"Fascinating, Challenging, and Counter-Intuitive","If you like having things you think you know challenged by a rigorous scientific thinker and expert debater, you'll like this book. You'll also learn a heck of a lot -- not only about animals and how they evolved, but about humans and how we evolved. As well as about how some of the advantages evolution has given us actually fog our thinking on issues such as animal intelligence.If you're not a rigorous scientific thinker, or can't stand to risk having a sacred cow gored (if I may use a term redolent of speciest violence against animals, or some such claptrap), don't bother reading this book. You'll only wind up giving it a one-star review and shrieking tediously about your violated sense of oneness with the Earth."
1,Stuck in the past...,"The author's opinions reflect the mind-set of many ethologists. They are stuck in a world in which the only valid way to understand other animals is to attempt to reduce their behavior to a set of reflexes to different stimuli. Consequently, they are completely incapable of making sense of the animals' subjective experiences. The Scientific Method is very good as some things - for example, chemistry and physics - but understanding the subjective experiences of other creatures is not one of them.Given the lack of balance and insight in this book, it would be interesting to find out whether it was funded by some interest group."
4,love story of the early 90s,"Really, this is just another catchy Bollywood love story of the early 90s.There are only two things likable about 'Anmol'. One is the music. Although the lyrics may not be the best, the tunes and melodies are beautiful and the songs are hummable. a young luminous Manisha Koirala is pleasant to watch. She does overact in a few scenes but otherwise she's a graceful presence."
5,A great book,"I'm a med student -- our book list said buy either the Guyton or this book, and based on the reviews, I bought the Guyton -- big mistake. Apparently the Guyton book is better on Cardiology, so I kept it, but I bought this book too and it's great. It's very well organized and to the point. The Guyton book takes at least twice the pages to say the same thing. I certainly don't have time to do any more reading than I have to. This book is well organized, clear, and to the point. I've had no problems with the binding, either."
4,"Weird, Wacky, and Fun: Not to be read to a class at school","The bizarre antics of Andy, the narrator, had me laughing and shaking my head. I love weird stories by authors with off-beat senses of humour, and this book fits the bill. My favorite story of them all is the one where he invents an invisible friend to help him get out of field day, but his mom turns the tables on him by treating the best friend even better than she treats Andy.I'm an elementary school teacher, and WOULDN'T READ this to my class due to some of the situations presented. The most disturbing story was the one where Andy dressed up as a girl and went to a dance, where one of the boys tried to pick himi up. However, I will read it to my children at home because I know there won't be any complaints. It's a perfect book to pick up when you have 10-15 minutes to spend reading because you can easily finish each short story within that time."
5,"Ahhhhhh, I love Ah-Mah!","Ah-Mah is a pleasure to read. The combination of Ah-Mah's life as a healer in Egypt, along with her connection to Atlantis and the dolphins, produces an enchanting story with just enough adventure to keep you turning pages to find out more. Looking forward to book two."
5,Works well.,"Really wanted one with gold contacts, but they were too short or too long. Sound seems good, so I'm happy.Bought this to extend myJBL Duet Speaker System for Portable Music and PC - Aluminum (Pair)."
3,Works,This extension works well but I wouldn't recommend using more than one or you start to notice a significant decline in signal quality.
4,Works,"Works like it should. Not sure what else to say here...can work for red, white, or yellow if you didn't already know that since this is RCA."
1,Low quality,"I have 2 of these. One is 6 months old and ok, but the other one just popped and fried within 5 months. I was lucky that it didn't hurt anything else. I don't think I'll get another."
3,Not as well-liked as others,"After reading the ""All Together In One Place"", I was expecting a lot more from the Tender Ties series. It's not that they aren't particularly good, they're just not as good as the others of Jane Kirkpatrick's that I've read. The timelines are a little harder to follow because they sometimes skip ahead months and even years. Like I said, it's not that these aren't good books, they just aren't quite what I've come to expect from her."
4,"Well-written, comprehensive, needs more example questions.","This book doesn't have any of the signs of being rushed out to be the first on the shelf (although it does have its share of mistakes). Screen-shots are spread throught the book, making it easy to follow examples with practice sitting at the computer. The book begins each topic from quite a basic standpoint (although some basic knowledge prior to beginning this book would be a definite advantage). Some areas of the exam syllabus aren't sufficiently covered (e.g. deployment, testing and Visual Source Safe), but others easily make up for this lack (e.g. ActiveX controls are covered very well). Example questions are generally too short, and it's a pity that more advantage wasn't taken of the enclosed CD (the questions in the book and on the CD are exactly the same)"
3,A Reference Book for Beginners!,I can not agree any more with those opnions rating the book 3 stars less
1,Simply awful,"This book is adequate if you are a beginner looking to learn a few new facts, but it has no business claiming that it can be used as a tool for the exam. I have used Sybex books for 6 exams now and this one is by far the worst of the lot. I don't mind typos and other oddities, but the material in this book is WAY to basic and brief to give you what you need to pass the exam. Save your money to buy a transcender and\or the Coriolis Exam Cram book if you want to pass the exam - buy this one if you want an easy read and are unconcerned about the exam itself."
1,"We Need A ""Zero"" Star Rating","This CD is recorded in mono, and the songs are not the radio-charting versions. Disappointment is guaranteed."
5,Weighted vest,Gaiam Walkvest Kit by Debbie Rocker (Previous Design)makes workouts more challenging - amazing how just 4 additional pounds can affect one's workout! You can add up to 16 pounds (I ordered the extra weights from the walkvest website - Amazon had a better price for the vest but did/does not offer the extra weights). The vest has been borrowed by several friends who like the additional challenge it provides while doing their cardio at the gym.
3,A must for any Python fan...however...,"When I received my incredibly awesome Black Knight I was ecstatic, but then a little disappointed. I'm not sure if it's because the doll was exposed to a good amount of heat in the wear house but the sword was directly on the front in his belt and ""glued"" onto the dragon design. The sword itself is pretty flimsy in construction and when I tried to gingerly pull the sword apart from the the front the design started coming with it, so I stopped and reluctantly leave the sword directly on his front. The helmet is the most detailed thing on the doll and that alone is great. The arms are easily pulled off but it does take a bit to attach them back in a straight way. Aside from all these defects I'm still happy overall with the product itself. Now I just leave it as a shelf sitter, occasionally pulling him apart to show friends. After all, its a very original toy and I'm too big of a Python fan to ever want to return him."
4,a good afternoon read,"well, i gotta give it up again, for another well written book by ms. winters. she had me hooked from the get go with renee (the main character) and her confused feelings of love, and the suspense of trying to solve a murder mystery at the same time! not to mention the fact that she thinks her love interest may be the one who commited the murder! you go ms. winters, the only thing i was disappointed with was the fact that it kinda dragged in some places, and it took so long for her to figure out who the murderer was. but the ending was cute, and just what a romance reader looks for, so i wasn't disappointed with that. thank you for such a wonderful book!"
1,Bad Batch? Believe the recent reviews!,I should have believed the recent reviews. Most of them say the product doesn't work. Instead I counted on the older reviews which talk about how great the Dorcy portable lamp is. Guess what...I received the Dorcy lamp and it doesn't work at all! Maybe there was a bad batch? Now I get to take a trip to the Post Office to return the lamp. Something is wrong. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING until they fix the problem.
1,doesnt work,Bought it a month ago to use on porchtried to use it todaydoesnt worktoo late to returnpiece of garbage
3,Works alright,"Not very much quality, but works well in an emergency situation to give you some light. Not real durable, but will last if you are careful and don't give them rough treatment."
1,lighting,what a piece of crap... save your money buy candles and matches. well it arrived quickly... of course it did... :)
2,"Everything is ok, not as bright as I was hoping though...",I assembled the lamp together and got it to light up. Works perfectly fine. Listen to the reviews about tightening the hanging thing with the base properly (with the switch on) and make sure to put the batteries in properly and you should be all okay! Not as bright as I was hoping though... (I am using Energizer alkaline batteries).Update:The thing stopped working in 2 hours. Not battery's fault! (I am a tech savvy person too.) This lamp is junk :/.
2,table lamp,I can't put this together. Nothing fits and I am waiting for a friend to help since I got him one.
4,Great spoons with a typo,"I bought these measuring spoons when I got sick of my plastic ones. The first time I used them I was baking a cake. Reaching for what I thought was the 2/3 of a cup spoon and found that it was labeled as 1/4. Two spoons are labeled as 1/4, but are the correct size for a complete set. Not a deal breaker as I can still measure and use the spoons, but a little bit annoying. I will need to add a label of my own to prevent any baking diasters.I would buy another set if given the choice, but these are not worth returning."
5,Praise-worthy,"Eighteen members of a Women's Bible Study are using this book as a resource in their own personal prayer lives. Beginning with praise puts all else in persprective, and the daily readings are a compilation of scriptures directing one's thoughts to a paticular topic of praise for the day."
4,Very encouraging and inspiring,"This book begins my day on a positive, God-praising way. It gets my thoughts off myself and any problems I'm going through and on to God's greatness and His great love."
4,Colors Match,"Great product if you are looking for touch up paint to match your vehicles paint color ! Great for touch up of minor scratches and chipped paint from rocks , etc."
5,Excellent,We use these foods along with the dry food for our dogs. Their health has improved since we eliminated grain from their diets. They are not losing hair anymore and eat this voraciously.. Ton't use anything else.
2,i was sad,"I Love CKY and I bought this and was disapointed. I think CKY is a great band yet many of the videos on this album sucked ass. I know they didn't have a large budget(its obvious on some of them) but maybe they just should of released Chopped and Sliced instead, which is the better part of the album. Dont think I'm a hater, but this dvd was kindy poopy and so was Haggard, Bam and company need to make another great CKY for everyone to love again."
1,Just a picture book,"I should have read more reviews before buying this book. It was about 2 pages of writing and the rest pictures. All the pictures looked like they could have all been taken at one run, because you see the same guys over and over. Also it's not a book of a few 1%er clubs as the title might have you think, but only OUTLAWS mc. Don't waste your money."
2,Not so good,"Darn thing sucks, it lasted about two months and died. I don't think it's all that accurate either. I wouldn't recomend it, but other people might not have as much bad luck as me."
4,Get out the map,"What an incredible collection! This collection of poems and autobiographical stories is full of politics, poignant observations, philosophies, all to an indigenous beat, and all bearing witness to the madness of our world. And especially to the atrocities done in this world, past and present. By letting us see through her eyes, Harjo makes the politics personal, and brings the novice reader into her fiery views, making us feel and see in different ways. I was most affected by the prose stories between the poems. And judging by the other reviews, this isn't even Harjo's best work overall!"
1,Wired for Europe,I bought this monitor to use as a second monitor along with a tablet for legal signatures. It came with an A/C monitor with 240 Volts and a plug that would only work in Europe. The input to the screen is a yellow RCA plug so one would have to have a special video card to use it with a computer. I sent it right back to Amazon.
5,Gets the job done.,"I used this product while in the Army. It gets the job done, easy to clean off. Soap,rag, and Facial cleanser to really get the deep stuff off."
2,Wilton Frosting,"The frosting did not taste very good, but it decorates well because it is stiff. I suggest you make your own if you care about taste more than appearance."
2,A Bit Over-dramatic,"I'm a very sensitive person and I tend to get emotional whilst watching things like this. That did not happen in this case. I watched this film in hopes of being inspired and I was, by a few of the women, but not by the main subject. I realize that this sounds quite INsensitive, but I didn't see how this woman's experience was documentary-worthy. She never seemed to feel crummy other than emotionally, i.e., feeling sorry for herself, never had to deal with chemotherapy....yes, she had many tumors but at no point in the film did they pose much of a threat other than psychologically. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she's okay and I understand how scary the situation must have been, but it just struck me as a very feeble example of an experience with cancer. Another woman in the film, I believe her name is Jackie, was on 17 medications. I don't recall the subject having had to take ANY drugs."
1,Worked One (1) time,"Sirs: That's right both traps worked a total of one time each I might add. I set the large one, caught a cat, went to set it again and the trap would not work properly. Same on the small one, worked one time then had to have hubbie work on trap. Needless to say I am very disappointed in this product. I need to use it right now but the thoughts of having to adjust the trap everytime I use it bums me out."
1,Poor quality traps,"The traps weren't worth even the cheap price. They rusted/tarnished before I could even use them, and are very difficult to set and open. To open them, you almost have to put your fingers inside the trap, risking injury to yourself."
3,Just average,"After one use the trigger rod became bent. I am not sure if I did it or not, but it made it useless. I have tried to bend it back into place and it appears to work, i.e. pushing on the trigger plate closes the trap. I have compared it to what I could get at Lowes and Home Depot. The cost is comparable, if you don't have to pay shipping."
2,Cheap and cheap,"Price was good, but you get what you pay for.I had to reconfigure the trip mechanism, too make it work, as it had too much play in it."
2,"Calm and Easy Going, But That's All","I enjoy his older songs and that's why I figured his new music would be good. Turns out this is a pretty boring collaboration, and to me was a stab at getting back into the scene after a drought filled with throat issues. Save the money for Hank Jr."
4,Story goes behind,"This is a nice book about how Dr. Erickson healed his patients. Very good to learn from his thought patterns. It is very useful for therapists and for interested individuals as well. I would recommend this book to parents especially, because most of the stories tell you about how to bring up a child, what are the most rewarding behaviours and how you could influence your child in a way that is permanent without abusing him or her."
3,"Slow Shipment, book OK, but not what I thought","The book seller sent an e-mail that said it was shipped right away, but it didn't arrive for several weeks. It was a gift to Grandson #2, and was ordered first, and said it shipped first. A different book for Grandson #1, ordered from a different seller was shipped a day later later, arrived within the ordering week, and was read, while we were still calling to ask did you get you book? Grandson #2 probably felt left out.Then we thought it was a book of jokes, but it turned out to be a chapter book. I don't recall now the exact description, but I've been in a contracting career for 35+ years, so normally I read words at face value."
5,"Calm, tranquil, transformative","Barbara Helen Berger's ""A Lot Of Otters"" is lovely. We begin seeing, on an open ocean, a little boy in soft red pajamas, floating about in a box! He's has something, which he drops, and soon otters begin to swim around and gather up what he's dropped and what the Moon herself is dropping as well (I can't give away more detail or it will take away some of the fun of the book for you).The illustrations are soft, sumptuous, and absolutely glowing--Berger has somehow managed to make each page look almost as though it's lit from behind. The toddler is rendered realistically, and the otters are shown sleek and lithe as they would be in real life--but everything has a moonglow cast to it, and that makes this book's pictures utterly and completely enchanting. A wonderful bedtime story, especially on a moonlit night!"
4,"visually beautiful, poetically haunting...","If you like visually beautiful stories, then you'd be hard-pressed to top the work of Barbara Helen Berger. The otters come to life on the pages of this book...frolicking, reading, rolling, and tasting stars.Besides its stunning visuals, ""A Lot of Otters"" is also filled with haunting, almost singing prose; one example:""A lot of otters saw the stars fall. They dove down into the dark, down into the deep.""Mrs. Berger is one of the best at what she does--she is a true myth-making aritist. It is hard to walk away from one of her stories without being somehow enriched. I recommend ""A Lot of Otters"" most highly."
3,A well illustrated myth appealing to mothers and toddlers.,A modern myth that was surprisingly well-liked by my two-year-old son. The pictures make the story for me. The otters are playful loveable characters. We have read it at least two times every night before bed.
2,Flaking enamel. . .beware,"We got this crockpot about a year ago and have used it maybe 15 times. We hand wash the crockery. The last time we used it, we noticed lots of black flecks in our soup, ranging from tiny (at first we thought it was pepper) to about 1/2 inch in diameter. It was the black enamel of the pot flaking off into our food! When we washed the pot, our sponge was black with enamel. Yuck! I suppose you get what you pay for."
1,HERE IS THE TRUTH...,"Like so many others, I saw the commercial for Durashine on T.V. and was convinced that it would provide the absolute best and unbeatable protection for my Mercury Cougar. WRONG! (I wish Amazon would allow vulgar language so that I may accurately describe this piece of... waste product)The cars on T.V. were being shot with lasers and exposed to ocean water. Nothing was damaging the paint; the water kept sliding right off the car and leaving a spot-free mirror finish with no effort. I would be a fool to believe every single thing on T.V., but I certainly did not expect the paint on my car to WEAR DOWN ALL THE WAY TO THE PRIMER even though I repeatedly used this product!!!Save your hard-earned money and buy a real wax. ANY kind of wax will work better than Durashine. Just trust me on this; I am so sick and tired of these dishonest companies scamming us by taking our money and leaving us with garbage, aren't you?"
4,What a great shine!,It hasn't rained since I used this product but the shine that it put on my vehicle is outstanding. I hope that it does sheet the water as advertised but we'll have to wait and see.
2,Be careful with this kit!!!,"The 9/32"" dovetail is VERY FRAGILE - when I tried cutting my first dovetail it broke within the first 1/4"" of my first cut. I looked at the cut and determined it was not aligned PERFECTLY with the template, so when the bit tried to go into the template it bent the bit and it broke.Porter Cable DOES NOT have this part on their price list as of the time of this post so you will have a useless tool if you make the slightest mistake with this kit."
3,wasnt that good,man no duh its rap city have you ever heard of B.E.T theres a show and rappers freestyle and the foice and volume sucks that because its 100 percent freestyle if it wasnt the volume would be o.k. i wouldnt say its the best freestyl but its good
2,This is what mediocrity sounds like,"I can't say that this 2-cd set is awful but I can't say it is good when there are much better djs who spin trance music with such precision like Paul Van Dyk and Sandra Collins. I am a trance junkie but this 2-cd set is a major letdown. It lacks the energy that ""Out There and Back"" [Paul Van Dyk] and ""Perfecto Presents Another World"" [Paul Oakenfold] possesses. ""Two Worlds"" just bored me to tears. ATB could learn a few things from both Pauls when it comes to trance 'cause it might get him back into my good graces (as if he was ever there to begin with)."
3,Hand Me Another Brick,"Excellent book on Nehemiah. One complaint with the Kindle version. It is missing a chapter in comparison to the printed book. The Kindle version is missing Chapter 12 ""Four Dimensional Praying"". I'm not sure why but I was confused while sitting in a study group."
2,broken upon arrival,"I guess I really need to do the review about the packaging, as I don't know how the product would have worked. It arrived shattered. There was no bubble wrap or anything inside the box that these glasses are packaged in, NOTHING for protection. Then the box of mugs was just tossed in the bigger box of items I had ordered. When it arrived, I heard the tinkling, and small pieces of glass were falling out. The only good thing is that Amazon is so incredible that they processed the refund without requiring the item returned."
5,PK,What more needs to be said in the music world about the quality of Martin. Great price & great sound from these strings. I will not go anywhere else besides Amazon.
4,the firm video with alison,I like this video. It is one heck of a workout. Definately for a more advanced person. It had lots of dance oriented moves.
2,Two left feet will not stop you?!,"This video states on the back that no dance experience is required and two left feet will not stop you ... WELL, I don't have two left feet and have been successful with dance videos on my cardio days but not this one. The moves are too complex and not called effectively enough to enable you to maintain a cardiovascular workout and follow along. I found myself subtituting jumping jacks and jump rope moves to maintain my heart rate when the choreography got too difficult. I still recommend The Firm Cardio Dance Slimdown for an easier to follow more effective workout. Don't always believe what you read on the back of those DVD sleeves."
1,"Could be OK if you have a dance background, but...","I really wanted a FIRM video just for cardio, but I had to continually rewind the DVD player just to try to do the moves in this workout. I could hardly get any cardio benefit because the moves were just too intricate and too fast to keep up with. I ended up jogging in place a lot. I finally took it out of the DVD player and put in Gilad's Split Routine Fat Burning workout for my cardio."
2,Difficult to follow,I was so hoping that I would be able to pick up the dance moves and follow along with Alison and her girls. She is my favorite Firm instructor and I have always been able to follow the steps of her various Firm workouts. I could not keep up with the moves on Cardio dance fusion although I did enjoy watching and I liked the music in the background.
5,Great workout and lots of fun!,"Yes this video is a bit challenging at first if you have never danced before or have little coordination (I was a dancer for a number of years and it still took me a minute to get the moves down)but overall it is such a fun and intensive workout that it hardly matters if you do all the moves perfectly or not, as she says in the video you can make each move your own. Alison is a fun and far from annoying instructor that does well at letting you know what moves are coming up next. In the end you get a fabulous workout that just flies by because it is so much fun to do!"
5,Incredible workout,"I had been doing Tracy Anderson's dance video and wanted another one to add in to the rotation. This one did not disappoint. It is challenging, but very fun. Sure, the steps may take a few times to get down, but that's what I like about it. You feel good about yourself when you figure it out and have a great time doing it! If you don't get them all in the beginning, just march in place until you can join back in. The workout is about 50 minutes of constant movement and you really work up a sweat! There is a 25 minute option as well. Recently, I've been doing this video on Tuesday and Thursday, then doing some Firm sculpting videos on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Along with a change in diet, I am definitely seeing results! If you want a fun, challenging, effective, cardio workout, get this!"
4,Pretty good,"This workout definately gives you an excellent lower body workout, and it is mixed up enough to not be too repetitive and boring."
3,"Ok, but not as much cardio as I was hoping for.",I found this DVD to be just ok. I would rather do more repetitions and more organized leg work. I was hoping for a DVD that would make leg work a cardio workout. This DVD with cardio burst is not enough of either leg workout or cardio. This would be a good DVD for beginners.
1,Waste of money,"As a new mom I was overwhelmed with thinking ""I need this and that"". What you really need is a dishrackRubbermaid 6032ARBLA Antimicrobial Large Dish Drainer, Blackand a cabinet or a drawer. This can stay at the store."
2,Unusable,"I'm not sure where some other reviewers are saying that they found a warning the tire will slip off. I wish I had seen that warning. I figured if I bought a wire bead tire that was the correct size and inflated it to what the tire was rated to, I would have no problems. Wrong. This tire consistently slipped off the wheel at any pressure above 60psi. I tried again and again to get it seated firmly, but even though I was pumping it to pressures below what it listed as the maximum, it came right off. I'll steer very clear of this company's products from now on, and I recommend you don't ignore this review looking for a good deal on a tire."
5,Great value,"I got this tire to use on my trainer, so I could save my more expensive red sidewall Vittoria for the road in case the trainer eats it. The gumwall is ugly as heck (perfect for a vintage bike though), but not concerned with aesthetics on the trainer. It's a really smooth ride on the trainer and popped on the rim really easily too, so switching on and off will be a breeze. I might even consider this brand's red sidewalls when my Vittorias wear out, it seems like a great tire for not much money at all."
1,Cheng Shin 27x1-1/4 GumWall Bicycle tires,"I bought 4 of these tires for 2 old vintage, very high end 10 speed bicycles from my younger days and fitted them on both bicycles. After the very 1st day of fast long distance training on both bicycles the rear tires ruptured. THESE are useless deadly and UNSAFE TIRES for serious cycling. They should be BANNED From Sales. At speeds of 20-30 mph after 1/2 hour of riding the Sidewalls ripped off the wire bead, this happened on both bicycles on separate days and the pressures were never over 85psi as checked with a digital gauge. I own several High End bicycles and have never seen this happen in the many thousands of miles I have done. I will never buy another of these CHEAP DANGEROUS TRASH. Losing a tire at 20mph is like being thrown out of a car and may be deadly if you spill. Buy only Real Bicycle tires, they may be $25-$50 a piece but they last years and are safe for serious riding."
2,Roll top table,"This is a compact table when folded up. However, most of the sliding pieces are plastic. And several were broken when we received it. The company gave me no problems on the return, but I'm not sure it will last very long with opening and closing the table. The folded up size was nice, but the sturdiness of the plastic fittings makes me question the trade off of size vs how well built it is."
5,Danger and romance--an exciting read!,"I am a fan of Martha Kirkland, and have most of her books. This is one of her best. Dee sets out to protect the orphaned baby of a friend, and thinks the hero, the Major, may want the child dead in order to get his inheritance. So, for a while, the heroine and the heroine don't trust each other, and are at cross-purposes, yet are attracted to each other. The sensuality is subtle, but you can feel the tension between them. There is good character development, and it shows what the couple likes about each other, so it is about love, not just lust. There are fights, gun shots, intrigues, and the couple goes on the run together to escape the people who murdered the child's father. Don't want to say more and spoil the plot! The writing is good--polished enough so that my English teacher mom would approve! I enjoyed this book and heartily recommend it."
5,"Great Picture, Very Easy to Use, Most Bang for your Buck","I've been using this camera for about 2 months now. It's absolutely fabulous. I haven't had any complaints yet. The pictures all have come out exceptional. It's easy for even my mom to use (who usually don't like anything electronics).You won't regret buying this camera. If I find anything bad, I will update this posting. I've had a Canon A520 before."
1,Dreadful customer service,"The customer service from Farberware is terrible. They run you around, you end up paying more than the value of the item after sending it back many times -- because you sent it to the ""wrong"" place - the place you were told to send it on the phone when you called to complain. Now they want you to send it someplace else. I will never purchase from this company again."
4,Very versatile and convenient,I just ordered this product today but I have used my daughter in law's carousel many times in her kitchen. It is wonderful. The kitchen scissors have a place to be put when not in use as do the other items in the carousel. I have no doubt that I will use and enjoy this in my kitchen as much as I have in her kitchen. This saves so much space from having to put these items in drawers and not be able to find them when I need them. I cannot wait to get this in.
2,"Good information, but VERY dry.",I had a hard time staying interested in this book because the writing is very dry. The concepts that I needed to understand for the class that this book was required for was rather difficult. I found myself reading the same sentence over and over because I couldn't fully concentrate. I wouldn't recommend reading this book for fun.
5,Mikita 14.4v battery 2-pack,"The product came within a week. The batteries are new, in original packaging. I charged them and have been using them with no indications that they will not perform like the original batteries. So far this has been a great find."
5,johnny hiland chicken pickin is finger lickin good,"this video is worth ten times what i paid for it. johnny is such and easy going guy and a great teacher. he shows you just where he is on the fretboard and even gives string numbers and he goes slow enough even i could follow what he was doing. i would love to meet him in person one day and thank him for producing this dvd. i hope he makes more dvd's cause i will buy every one of them. thanks johnny, and i know you have helped many people become better guitarist's. i feel more confident already. sincerely cy vane"
1,Don't waste your money,"Really, while ""Richard Marcus"" seems to be a very good story teller, in my opinion, this book is total b.s. The moves he talks about are incredible, and there are so many amazing coincidences throughout it, that it seems impossible that all of this happened the way he wrote it. I do have to say that I never gambled in the 70s, so, obviously many things have changed, but I find it hard to believe that his group continuously got away with the same scams over and over, and for the most part the gambling industry was none the wiser.If you want a good book on gambling, buy ""Bringing Down the House,"" by Ben Mezrich. Now THAT's a good read!"
4,nice paper,"just fine...I cooked tons of things .,.good paper..4 stars just because one can not ""love"" just regular paper for cooking:)"
2,Forgive and Forget THIS BOOK,Didn't like author's style of writing... I ended up skimming the book and highlighting a few profound points. Not worth reading.
1,Hurt By Christian Slant,"This book would have been good, but it is so slanted towards Christinanity that it is not worth reading by anybody not of that persuasion."
4,This was a good buy for me,"I have been very happy with my Jabra Bluetooth Headset. It is very comfortable, hold a long charge and sound quality has been good. It was somewhat difficult to install, but after that a solid thumbs up."
2,Not a good product,"Its definitely not worth the hype and price. The earpiece is kind of uncomfortable and the most problematic about this is lot of interference while you talk. Sometimes, I have to unconnect the Bluetooth and talk on the phone, which defeats the whole purpose.I am thinking of buying a motorola or nokia one, definitely not going for Jabra nemore."
3,good unit...,This head set works very good. Easy to set up and use. The only complaint I would have is that it sometimes disconnects itself from the cellphone. I would then have to reboot the cellphone again to connect it to the headset. This does not seem to be an uncommon problem as one of my friends has the same thing happening to his bt250v.
1,Don't waste your money on this dog,"This earbud was a disaster start to finish, and I finally replaced it after a few frustrating months. It never fit well into the ear, so I had to hold it in, which kind of defeats the whole purpose. The reception was bad, and full of static. It wouldn't consistently connect with my phone (treo 650), and I frequently had to go thorough the whole discovery process to get it connected. The buttons were useless because of bad placement. There was no good way to turn it on or off. After I gave up on it, I occasionally lost the sound on my phone because the earbug would suddenly turn on in my pocketbook. I'm taking the time to write this review because I'm still angry."
1,STATIC,"Tried two of these with two different brand new phones, a samsung and a Razr. Same preformance with both. A lot of static. Sounded like a normal set when you walk too far away frome the phone- only I was right next to it. Returned them both."
1,Horrible sound quality,"I'm very sorry I bought this as the sound quality is truly awful-you have to wear it right next to your phone, & then your reward is you sound like you're in a cotton filled cracker box. Go for the Plantronics Voyager 510 instead."
3,"Jabra BT250 -- good, but not for me","The Jabra BT250 is small, very comfortable and easy to use but, unfortunately, it didn't work with my Samsung M610. Those I called said I sounded like I was in a tunnel or on speakerphone and, on my end of the conversation, I had crackling and noise. I was disappointed because the multiple gel ear tips really helped with a perfect fit in my ear and the weight was negligible; in addition, the charger was really easy and compact."
2,"It works, but it diconnects and the sound quality is sub-standard.","The Jabra BT250v connects but from no more than 5 feet and not well if the phone is in your pocket. The sound coming in isn't too bad, but the sound on the other end has the 2 tin cans with a string sound, hollow and scratchy. For occasional use it might not be too bad but if you spend any amount of time traveling on the phone, I would look elsewhere."
5,Great Bluetooth Headset,I have trouble hearing my phone in the car. I had bought another Bluetooth headset but didn't like how it fit on my ear or the volume of sound from it.I bought the Jabra BT250V and found that it was very comfortable to wear all day. The interchangeable ear pieces allow you to get the best fit for your ear.The volume controls were well placed and provides a comfortable volume. I can hear the phone conversations in my car or other noisy environs.I recommend using the Jabra BT250V
4,Good product,"Although I meant to order the non-vibrating headset, it is easy to turn off the vibrating feature, so I am fine with what I received. The only problem I have is that the battery doesn't have the life that the manual declares it should. The unit stays powered off most of the time, so I would hope that the battery life is retained. However, when I do turn it on, I can only talk about 20 minutes before it starts beeping. Not sure why this is."
2,JUNK!!,"It's too loose around the ear and is always falling off. If your phone is not in direct sight of the ear piece, meaning if it's in your pocket on under your jacket, there's static. If your outside and there is just a hint of a breeze, there's static. This thing is a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Pretty impressive for a small package,"I bought this device as a way to avoid waking my husband when I need to be up earlier than he is. I was a little hesitant since this is a keychain sized item, rather than one of the full size silent alarms. I was pleasantly surprised that it works quite well! Using the functions is easy even without the included instructions, and I really like that the buttons are set on the side of the unit. I can place it under my pillow without worrying about accidentally shutting it off. I think this unit will work well for anyone, especially those wanting the portability. May be a bit small for really heavy sleepers......I'm not one, so can't say for sure. I just know I'm happy with mine!"
1,Broke right away,I used this timer for ADHD and found it a bit unintuitive. I put it on my keyring in my pocket and the button got pushed accidentally sometimes. It broke within a week. Sometimes the vibration shut off and others it rang in the middle of the night.
2,ok I like the pads that are show more results darker.,"I have bought pads for years. The lavender makes its smell better, but I like the stronger ones. I like to see the black tar that pulls out all my toxins. These are light gray in color at the end and I'm not sure they work as well."
1,Pretty but not accurate!,"We have liked these narrow measuring spoons,and they do fit a need to go inside of splice jar lids. But we were recently baffled to realize that they are not anywhere close to accurate. The only one that is correct is the teaspoon measure, the others are off by 25-50%. It is a good design idea, and this should be an easy fix. I'd like to buy a pair that were actually correctly calibrated. The teaspoon police slipped up on this one!"
4,good for the money,"This assembled easily. We like the wood finish and the overall look. For the money , its a good deal."
3,Not for the contemporary/modern decorator,I liked this book. It focused on good things like where to purchase things looking outside of the box. I read the book cover to cover and I really wished the book had more about contemporary/modern decorating. It really just had the definitions of what they were.
4,"Lovely, truly Canadian Music","It is sad their recordings are not more widely available. But this one is worth tracking down. Some of the songs are joyful, others haunting, but all worth it."
5,A haunting story about the love of a father.,"Fine TV film with a very decent cast and quite good acting and direction. A pity this hasn't been made into a DVD.The plot is an all too common but at the same time solid story about the guilt ridden love of a father for his dead child.Set in the South-East US, the film take us through a gentle but haunting story of a father who is guilt torn about having remained absent of his children lives for professional reasons, until hils eldest girl dies in a car accident.Following that, the lead character starts receiving strange clues that his dead child might be trying to contact him from the beyond and embarks on a quest to let her know he loved her.A sad but lovely story that will touch the most hardened viewers."
2,Shame on Scrabble! What a rip-off!,"I love Scrabble! My husband and I play every week. So when we saw the Scrabble Onyx edition, looking sleek in black-and-silver, with a built-in turntable, we thought we'd treat ourselves with some gift cards we had received.What a rip-off. Shame on Scrabble for charging $50 for this dud. The turntable sticks and is ridiculously noisy. We'll end up putting the board, turntable and all, on top of the $5 plastic lazy susan we used with our classic Scrabble board. The silver paper on the board is not completely glued down, but bubbles up at the side. The timer only works sporadically: you have to tap it from time to time to get the sand flowing in the hourglass, so basically it's useless. The scorepad is probably the nicest part, and we won't even use it, because we already have a notebook dedicated for that purpose.So don't waste your money on this one."
2,Very fragile,"I order this to match my dinnerware set and I was very disappointed since the plate were so resistant and this glasses are very very fragile. We already broke 3 of them and we got the on May, so I only recommend them if you are not using them as your every day glassware. The pattern is very pretty, that is the only positive thing I found on them."
3,picture perfect but.....,the picture looks stunning that's why I bought it for my Mom's birthday. the crystals look great but i am disappointed with the silver component of this bracelet coz it looks like polished aluminum. ideal for evening wear to highlight the crystals & not bring attention to the silver.
3,"Bjork, the artist","It seems Bjork has expanded her repertoire or artistic achievements by joining in with her partner, Matt Barney, in helping him to add to his catalog of drawing restraint art projects. Drawing Restraint 9, being the most complex, showcases not only Bjork's continuously re-inventive vocals and scoring, but also her acting abilities (in the movie, not the soundtrack). The music, however, is both eerie and sublime. Somehow, Bjork is able to capture some of the essence her long-time fans would appreciate, but also add some of the new ""stuff"" that has influenced her recently. It is difficult to listen to. Do not expect the early 90's pop/synth style music that propelled Bjork's career. This is more complex and more eccentric. If you are patient, you might actually find it enjoyable."
2,Scattered,"It's difficult to find beauty in music when it lacks general aesthetic composition. The music on this Soundtrack could work well with a visual backdrop which complements it's sporatic and sometimes irritating arrangements. Listening to it, there were a few songs which I found quite gorgeous (Track #1 Gratitude; Track #8 Storm), but as a whole, the fluid ebb and flow which emulates from recent works (Homogenic; Vespertine; and most of Medulla) is lacking."
2,Not one to sit and listen to outside of the confines of the film,"I'm a huge Björk fan, have been ever since The Sugarcubes hit the scene in the late 80s, and although this is compositionally interesting for what it is - an avant garde art film score - it's definitely not one I want to sit and listen to for pleasure ever again; I believe it is music that is best suited to hear while viewing the Matthew Barney film; I actually grew quite bored while listening through it the first time and afterwards I knew that I would never drop it in my CD player ever again."
2,Product Specs Review,"Product specs are difficult to understand, I have ordered twice, first order was 3inches wide, 2nd order was only 2 inches wide. The product specs dont tell you how wide the tape actually is. I want the 3 inch tape but I cannot tell from any of these specs which width is which."
2,Size: 4 In X 5 Ft ?,there is quite a difference between ft. and yards. is this product really Size: 4 In X 5 Ft ?I don't like the proof reading.
1,company,I ordered these off T.V. Have not received items yet. Going on 3 weeks. I was told I would receive items within 10 days.Called customer service today. Of course it was in India. I was hung up on and same girl answered phone and gave me a different name.I was told she could not give out Corporate numbers ans their was no management to talk too.I am very leery of this company and have to now spend time checking them out.Read all reviews before ordering from this company.Will write a review when and if items received.
5,Excellent Value,This knife holder is the answer for getting all of my knives out of the drawer and into an easily accessible block. It is inexpensive pine vice oak but looks good and does the job. Highly recommended.
5,Ronco knife holder is GREAT!!!,"I purchased the Ronco knife set for my fiance for Christmas (we both love to cook) and he has been wanting them for a long time. I got them at a discount store but the knife block was not included. It's a huge knife set so what to do??? I looked on Amazon.com of course and as usual they did NOT let me down. They had the knife block at the lowest price I could find. It is a large block that has slots for all the Ronco knives plus several extra slots for other of your ""favorites"". It came in a ridiculously short period of time (I think like 2 days after I placed the order). Amazon.com is great. I can't say enough nice things about the company!!!"
5,Great Purchase,"I have been searching for over a year trying to find a storage solution for my Ronco Knife set. Recently, the Ronco infomercial was on and I heard them offer the block. When I checked their website, the price for the block along with the exorbitent shipping costs was beyond my budget. Fortunately I decided to look on Amazon and Voilà, here it is at a much cheaper price with free shipping. I was as excited as a child on Christmas Eve while I waited the two days for the block to arrive and I am not disappointed; it's perfect."
2,Hardfall,"2 1/2Pygmalion sounds just like I would dread: a poor man's Slowdive. These potentially engaging songs suffer from shoddy production work mixed with poor experimental choices, offering what is essentially a bad trip over a smooth high. A strangely weak, underwritten final album of the limit-exposing kind, and one that felt like a definitive step backwards and reason enough for disbandment."
3,"cheap cutting boards, but at cheap price","This won't last very long - the second you get them wet (ie - washing them), they will start cracking. I put one in the dishwasher (which may be my mistake) and it came out cracked. The others I'm now carefull to wash by hand and dry, but they're still slowly starting to dry out and crack on the edges.I recommend spending the money on nicer cutting boards - I will soon! I also recomment spending $10 on one board than 3 - the small one is alost useless anyway."
1,Cheap Product,"These ""Farberware"" cutting boards are nothing like the actual higher quality Farberware cutting board that I bought a few years back. The wood is not sanded, grooves are poor quality, and the boards are not oiled."
4,These boards are great...,"Don't listen to the poor reviews. (Who puts a cutting board in a dishwasher?) How can you beat 3 cutting boards for $10? And they work great. And yes, I have found plenty of uses for the small board. You don't have to be that imaginative. You could spend more, but why?"
1,Unhappy,I thought with the name Farberware attached to these cutting boards they would be a quality item. This was a mistake on my part. The cutting boards have warped after one use. I should have known the price was too good to be true.
2,Warped and cracked after first use,"Good price for 3 cutting boards but not worth it. I used the large and medium-sized board, washed them with warm soapy water and immediately wiped them dry. On the second use, I noticed the medium one had warped and split on the edge, right where the groove is. The large board had a long crack along the middle. Didn't bother trying the smallest one.. very disappointed and returned them. Looking for a thicker/sturdier one now."
3,Decent for the price,"No split boards, but the medium and large board were cupped when I got them, not TOO badly, but it definitely makes chopping things finely difficult.They're serviceable, and for the price I couldn't ask for better, but they're not great boards."
2,Terrible Manual,"The Pioneer Receiver is a good product if you know how to hook up modern equipment. I have not seen as bad a manual as comes with this product in a long time. There is no overall diagram for the back pannel, unless you are hooking your compnents up exactly as they describe, you better read and understand the entire manual. Took me way to long to do a simple connection of DVD player with s-video and optical digital audio input. Right now I am not sure I can connect all of my components into this reciever because of the pathetic manual."
1,Do not buy! Major problem with unit!,"I have to say this for all who are insterted in this unit. When I first got it it worked good. It was a little hard to first set up. This was my second A/V receiver, the first was an RCA (and that one still works after 7 years). After about a year and a half the left channel went out. This is the last time I will buy any Pioneer product. This is the third Pioneer purchase I have made and their were all new! They all have FAILED within 2-3 years. Maybe I just have bad luck with Pioneer. I have had friends who also experanced product falures. I can not recommened this product or any other Pioneer"
2,Not as great as they say..,I bought the reciver as part of Black Friday Sale from Best Buy. I bought high quality Polk speakers to go with it but the problem I see is that the reciever volume needs to be set very high to hear anything from TV. The total range of volume is 0-72 and you have to set to 45 to even hear properly through the front speakers. I would recommend staying away from this. My previous choice of YAMAHA was better.
2,vsx-816 audio cutting out,"like everyone else, my audio is cutting out. It works again when I off/on the receiver, but this has become a more than once daily necessity. Doesn't look like there is anything that can be done, so I guess I'll just ride the storm till I can't take it anymore. Would not recommend this or anything else along the pioneer line, as this really should have been recalled."
5,Healing,"This CD is encouraging and surely will lift you up! True to his style, D. Lawrence delivers! Remember, God IS restoring the years you've sown in tears! This is a timeless treasure."
4,ceramic insulator - electric fence,Came in on time. Exactly as described. It is an insulator.. what more can I say? Should work as intended
4,"Ipod shuffle case, a bit bulky but great protection, thank you!!","I would rather have something a bit more streamlined, this is like a very fat compact. :) But it does a great job of protecting and holding the 2nd gen. ipod, which is so small and easy to lose, that I lost my first one. So I swore I would find a case for it that would stand up to dropping on occasion and protect my little shuffle. Well this case is as close to perfect as you can get, esp. for the price!! No more tangled ear bud wires, yes! Thank you Speck, I'll be back!"
5,My first Scroll Saw,"I am in the process of getting ready to retire. My plan is not to hibernate but to stay active, and keep my mind in good shape. I hit on the idea of a scroll saw last summer and have spent the months searching for the best one for me. I decided on the Delta 40-570 because of it's size and features. I am a machinist by trade, and enjoy working with high quality tools. This saw will provide me with the opportunity to fulfill my desires during my retirement. I enjoy working with wood and plan to build things for my house and grandkids."
4,Best cover overall,"I looked at the Nokia OEM cover. Cheaply made, not worth it. I also looked at the ""stingray"" and it has a weak looking wheel on the case but does have an antenna loop which protects you if the fastener comes loose for some reason.Quality of this unit's stitching is top notch. If the belt clip release takes too much effort to open, email Cellet and they will send you a replacement clip as they did me. BTW, Amazon also sells replacement buttons and clips for this model. Needs an antenna loop to protect against fastener coming loose and letting unit drop out but...nothing is perfect. If you're in a crowd where you might bump someone, stick your cell phone in your pocket to avoid risk of loss.Overall, this is probably the best case out there for the money."
4,Nice cutting boards,The cutting boards offer a good variety of sizes. A larger size would be a nice addition. I would recommend these for anyone.
2,Farberware 3 pc Poly Cutting Board Set,"Ordered this as a result of your prior reviews, however I am disappointed. From the 1st time I used each board, cut marks appeared and stayed. I can see that I will be replacing these in the near future. But, the sizes are very versatile."
4,Great boards for various cutting uses,"These cutting boards work well and clean up easily. They don't stain for dark foods as long as I put them in the dishwasher. Hand washing doesn't always get them totally clean. Two of the boards are kind of small, so I wish they would be a little bigger, but overall I really enjoy them. I like their handles and are easy to hold in place when I am cleaning them or using them in the sink for messy foods."
3,"This film will bring tears, but drives home a message!","Although the video and audio on this DVD is par with a VHS tape, reflecting 1970s TV movie production values, the story of a Magi, along with his Servant in search of the Messiah to bring Him a gift, will touch the most hardened heart. You might catch this on Christian TV sometime around Easter, but don't miss it. Martin Sheen and Alan Arkin are brilliant. Look for Charlie Sheen and other rising and established stars in cameo roles."
1,My hamster has better acting skills,Great cover for the DVD.....but perhaps the worst piece of acting ever. I especially like the ending so I could throw it away
1,Falsely titled ripoff,"The listing shows the title and authors of a renown work in clinical psychology, and it appears to be a digital edition of the book at a good price. It is not. For your $4.95 you get a one page review of the book. Don't waste your money.I'll be filing complaints wherever I can."
2,Rear visor won't stay.,"I ordered these window visors because they were inexpensive. Installation was easy except for the driver's side rear window. The adhesive won't hold. No matter how much I try to press on the visor and the window trim to make good contact, the visor won't stick when the window is down. The visor stays fine with the window up as the pressure of the window against the trim keeps it in place. I would not drive anywhere with the window down as the visor will fly off. Looks like I'll be buying double sided tape this weekend to try to get it to stick. Very disappointed. On the bright side, the front visors stick very well."
4,Lovely and large,"Sophie Conran's celadon mugs are beautifully shaped. The color is a neutral that actually works fine with three different dish sets. The mugs are well weighted to hold. My husband reaches for this one first if it's in the cupboard. My only disliked feature is that the circumference of the mug takes up a great deal of space on the cupboard shelf and that due to the same issue, the mugs don't readily fit into my dish rack in the dishwasher--I get them in, but it's not a good fit."
3,Supplement?,Not sure if this supplement does anything at all. i have heard great things but havent seen results. Hopefully this will start to produce results.
4,I like it!,"It's smaller than I had expected, but I use it all the time. It holds my heavy purse very well. It folds & came in its own velvety pouch. I was asked where I got it by someone who'd been looking to buy one for herself. These should be in stores. It has a magnet for added support on metal surfaces. I just wish it hadn't scratched my wood desk, but I shouldn't have tried to move it with my purse hanging from it."
5,Pretty purse hanger,This is something I've always wanted for myself because it's such a great idea! I hate when I'm at a restaurant or something and have to put my purse on the floor because the chairs have curved backs or because I'm in a booth. I got this for my mom and she was very happy with it. She had been wanting one too. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition with a little velvet bag to keep it in while it's in your purse. Very pretty.
1,Is this some sort of joke?,"The add says ""customers buy this with the Canon DC330"" but the battery does'nt work with the DC330. How stupid!"
2,Infinity 4 x 6 Speaker,I installed these Infinity 4 x 6 speakers as the front half of a 4-way speaker system in the kick panels of a vintage Plymouth. I`m not thrilled with their performance. They looked fine on paper but they just lack across the entire musical spectrum. Bass breaks up these speakers terribly and the treble is thin and harsh. I have a 45 watt receiver/amplifier that rarely sees high volumes but yet these speakers distort very easily. I rely mainly on the 6 x 9`s in the package tray for the complete sound. I would not recommend these speakers.
2,Read Chopra's other work,"If you want a glimpse into the insights of this gifted thinker and writer, this book isn't the place to begin. Like Chopra's previous fiction works, the effort to find the message is tedious. His scholarly works are more direct and much more rewarding. Try Chopra's ""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success"", ""The Way of the Wizard"" or ""Everyday Immortality"" for new and exciting ways of looking at yourself and your place in the universe."
2,too small,this cabinet was too small for our television equipment so we had to put the boxes on top of the cabinet which defeats the purpose of the cabinet. i wish i could send it back
3,what can i say?,"This book seemed ok. BUt I was a bit dissapointed. The text seemed really was really confusing and didn't give well rounded explanations. it had subtle stratagies and seem to try very hard to be humorous. it seemed to try so hard that it wasnt funny anymore.in the practice test, there was no converstion chart and the problems were not similar to the real problems that you would find in a real SAT book. The book kept on repeating the same stratagy and kept on saying ""you will do well if you read this book, you will do well because you have this book.""This book only gave a small amount of points to my score before i got this book. I dont mean to say this book is no use at all, because it isn't. it gives some insight, but i have to say, i wasn't very satisfied."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,I DO ALOT OF COOKING AND APPRECIATE GOOD QUALITY CUTLERY. THE PRICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN INDICATER THAT THIS SET WAS NOT FOR ME. THE KNIVES WERE DULL WHEN I PURCHASED THEM AND STILL DULL AFTER SHARPENING THEM. THEY ALSO GOT LITTLE RUST COLORED WATER MARKS WHEN PLACED IN THE DISHWASHER.
2,Not what I exspected.,"When i made this puches I thought I was getting a Train set and all I recieved was a set of train tracks. I tried to get the money back but, ended up with confusion."
2,"Ok for the price, but not very good over all.","The quality of some the tools is poor, in particular the electronics vacuum and the soldering iron. The vacuum is completely ineffective, and the soldering iron does not get hot enough to wick solder. The flash-light is shoddy.The rest of the stuff is of acceptable quality, although I have seen the rachet on the screw-driver break under heavy usage (a number of people at work own these kits).You're probably better off just buying pliers, a good screw-driver kit, tweezers, and a flashlight. A lot of the items (the soldering iron, the allen wrenches, the IC extractor) probably won't see much use in general PC repair anyway."
2,Poor Organization,"This book is very poorly organized. It is divided into public and private trails, instead of by region. The index only contains the names of trails, not the names of the parks or places the trails are located. Some things which were missing from the book include a large map of the region with numbers indicating where the major trails are located and a listing of the trails with length and difficulty. If you can find the trail-heads the maps are very good and there are nice descriptions of the trails. This is not a good book if you are not familar with the area."
4,Very good.,"Claire Gillespie was a top reporter on an overseas assignment when whe fell in love with an FBI agent, Michael Kazarian. When Claire accidentally broke his cover, Michael was murdered. During her next news assignment in California, she found out that Michael had been married! If just so happens that Michael's widow, Laurel Madden, was heading the case Claire was to cover about a serial killer targeting infants.Claire was like a dog with a bone! She was out to prove Laurel a murderer. However, Michael's ex-partner, Dan Sprague, kept getting in the way.***EXCITING! No John Grisham or Patricia Cornwell here, but well worth your time and money to read. Some stores have put this under Fiction, others Thriller, and still others as Romance. Well, the first two make sense. The last does not. Romance is such a small portion of this story. It is all Thriller!***"
2,"Was expecting fabulous, got mediocre","What was it about Random Acts that just didn't click? I saw it recommended on a website or reviewed in a magazine as ""Tight, exciting, romantic..."" Well, it wasn't. It just didn't come together. The book pulled me in quickly enough (even though I hate plots that harm or exploit children), but then an equally intricate plot was introduced and there didn't seem to be any connection. When the plots and characters did finally come together in the end, the result was totally implausible. I wanted to feel sympathetic towards the characters but found them to be poorly developed and 2 dimensional. And there were WAY too many of them. This is Taylor Smith's 3rd or 4th book. I'm in no great hurry to read her others. Too bad - this proved to be quite a disappointment."
2,Just don't wash it,"I have 2 of these plate frames on two different cars, one is on a car that is garaged and sees less than 10,000 miles a year, the other is on my daily driver car.I have had these frames on the car for less than 3 months, and already they are starting to fade, turn grey, and the finish is chipping off. This is with hand washing and Meguiar's Soap and a simple garden hose.I was assuming this was a good deal, but you really do get what you pay for. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 just because it's still technically one one piece, but no longer in one color OR in good condition..."
5,One of the best musicians,"We LOVE Laurie Berkner. We saw her on Noggin 3 years ago and could not wait to find this DVD with most of her music. Really wish ""Family"" was on here but it is a great DVD nonetheless."
5,Moose and Zee,"After Nick Jr cancelled Moose A Moose and Zee recently, I was looking for a DVD that featured the pair for my 13 month old daughter. This was the only DVD that I could find. It's great!! It has plenty of spots with them between songs and included in the special features are four videos with fun cartoons of just Moose and Zee. It was perfect and my daughter loved being able to see her favorite two characters again. Also, we have already memorized the Laurie songs that are catchy and fun to dance around to. It was a perfect buy for us!"
5,makes you want to sing along,"Bought this for my granddaughter who will be turning 2 and she loves it. When she comes over she right away asks for the ""songs"". She likes clapping along with the song I'm a mess, tries to kick her legs up to the song 5 days old and basically just likes all the songs. I enjoy watching her as she watches and dances to the dvd."
5,Not like any other Visual Basic book on your shelf,"This is distilled expertise on Visual Basic .NET - concise, complete, and correct. Anyone from beginner to pro will learn new things about VB concepts and syntax.I use this book when I teach introductory Visual Basic .NET. It is the best way for a student to zero in on a single topic. They can find a brief but complete exposition, and an example that strips away all irrelevancies to illustrate the concept at hand.But I also learned some things that I didn't know from this book, and that's after 4+ years working on VB.NET (back into the betas) and writing several books of my own.Don't buy this book to learn how to build complete applications, or to learn a lot about the .NET Framework. There are other books for those needs. But if you live in the world of Visual Basic, this book is an essential resource."
1,Not Happy,"I found the sellers name in the book, was not happy about this purchase. Will not do this again, would rather go to barnes and Noble and pay extra for a new book, or have them order the new book for me.. Thanks"
2,Waste of time,I'm very confused by all of the rave reviews of this book. It has very little useful information and is mostly filled with the author telling stories. Not exactly what I was hoping for!
1,Wacky Political Statements in an Ebay Book Damaged Credibility,"I read a few chapters, up until I got to the page where the author claims that Al Gore invented the internet. When I realized it wasn't a joke, I couldn't possibly take anything else in the book seriously. I trashed it and read another book on Ebay."
3,This book is for new ebay user!,This book is for new ebay user! I finished more than half of the book and have not seen anything valuable yet!
4,ABook of Memories by Peter Nadas,"Monumental work that stands comparison with Proust; It tells of all thr changes in post war Hungary and also paints an almost psychological portrait of an artist""s coming to grips with his life as a MAN, a creativeindividual and the events in his life which help him to understand what it means to be human in the 20th century..An amazing work that shows what it was like in Middle europe after the end of WW 2."
1,DRIVEL,"I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this long, overly dramatic, boring, pretentious drivel that strove much too hard to be art and ended up as good kindling."
5,Considered the classic by many,Small and to the point. May not have the latest fad but it has the classics. Perhaps the most common bartenders reference.
4,adobe acrobat 8,"this is a very useful product for a law firm like us because we make forms and we interact with clients using safe passwords... so after making a wonderfully useful form, we emailed to client with a password to open so that they could fill it up and email back to us.... but our clients who had lower version/free version of adobe couldn't do that. they just had to print the form out and mail to us... which made this whole password business silly. do they have to buy this same product to do what we want to do?"
5,Like Very Much,"I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work. The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features. Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media ""binders."" This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page."
4,Thank You Bill Wyman!!!,"Having only ever heard Tucky Buzzard's 4th & 5th albums (Alright On The Night and Buzzard), I was pleasantly surprised to find that their first three albums were remastered and released in this fine two disc set.What a treat to hear this band from their beginnings to the long lost (Spanish only release) third album. Managed and produced by longtime Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman, this band was clearly a diamond in the rough.From a great band that never made it as big as they should have, these tunes clearly display some fine songs that harken a bygone era.As the linear notes say ""pitched somewhere between the more pastoral Psychedelic sound of yore and the new, heavier Prog-Rock style"".Thanks again Bill and now let's get albums 4 and 5 remastered and released on CD! :)"
2,Lasted 20 minutes,"My boxer mix loved this toy...she's still whining at me to give it to her...however I had to take it away from her because she chewed the first knob off in 20 minutes. I was afraid she was going to swallow the big piece of rubber and choke. I had just had an emergency bill with her 5 days ago from eating an ice pack. I didn't need a bowel obstruction on top of it.If your dog is a determined chewer, I would not recommend this toy."
3,unsure,I have been unable to view this VHS tape to see if the tape is good so I cannot comment on that. The timliness in which it was sent was not very good so it is now in Alaska and I am in California. I shipped it to Alaska so that I could give it to someone as a gift and it never made it there while I was there so I am unsure how to rate the product itself. I was a little disappointed that it took about a month for me to receive the product.
5,"Written Truth, written beautifully",Madeline L'Engle is a beautiful writer. She is able to speak about Truth in such a compelling and beautiful way. I am loving her daily reflections.
5,Glimpses of Grace: Daily Thoughts and Reflections,Madeleine L'Engle is a fantastic author and her books are great for all ages. My husband has read many of her books and has enjoyed all of them.He highly recommends this book!
2,Modular Hood,"This modular hood simply snaps onto the filter holder by pressing on the upper and lower faces. For telephoto lenses you can add additional Cokin Modular Hoods by clipping them into the first one. This hood helps to elimante lens flare. The hood (255) is necessary in order to use certain Cokin filters and accessories : The Prism (219), Mirage (220), Coupling Ring (308) and Colored Diffusers (082). It is a good ideal to have at lease two of the hoods. If two is too many just snap it off"
2,NOT AS SHOWN!!!,"Image shows WHITE keyboard tray - no longer available, black only (Amazon said they would change it - they didn't). I returned it."
2,Decent as a guideline only,"This book has very little content in terms of J2EE itself. The title is very misleading - this cannot in itself be a study guide for the exam. To tell you truthfully, I am dissapointed with the book and would not recommend anyone to buy this book as anything more than a objectives refresher. This is an unbiased review - I am a software engineer planning to take the test in about a month. If you are planning to take this exam skip this book - it didn't help me much in my preparation and I'm sure you will be hearing the same from others who have bought this book."
2,Doesn't contain what it says in the back cover,"This book totally omitted ""Legacy Connectivity"", ""Messaging"". Other objectives are also not detailed enough. I don't know if it is deliberately done or not..."
4,Sun Certified Enterprise Architecture for J2EE Technology Study Guide (Sun Microsystems Press),"Yes, this book seems to be quite simple and informative,Just has what you wanted to get certified as an Architecture for J2EE."
3,Good book...but not that great,Its a good book..but is very short....its more like a review of things rather than expanding knowledge..
2,Definitely not enough to pass the exam,"You can get through this book in a few days, but the material here is not enough to pass the exam.You would definitely want to read the GoF Design patterns book, along with a good book on EJB."
2,Covers some stuff but don't expect much of it,"This book do cover some stuff you need to know to pass the certification exam , like firewalls , common architrecture , some information about security and localization . But it's a very badly written book , contains a lot of simple bugs like : book says that the name of interface which session bean has to implement is javax.ejb.Session ( not javax.ejb.SessionBean ) . I still found this book useful for the exam itself but I will never use this book as a referense ."
2,good objectives list - nothing more,I agree with the previous reviewer completely - it's just a list of topics you need to cover to prepare for the exam. You could have just printed out the table of content from this book and start reading other books on each of the topics with the same success.
2,Very simple book,I purcahse this book with some other expectations.The book cover all the subject in the exam but in a poorly way.
5,Too Cute,"Too cute for Boston LoverCan't Waite to see My husbands reaction when he opens this gift, He will love it."
3,Nice but doesn't fit on all decks,"I like this product. However, it didn't fit on my deck railing, so I had to attach it to another surface. Otherwise, sturdy product that does the job well."
1,A spoof?,"Please refer to Cilla's February 2010 excellent review for story line.I found this book on my TBR shelf and after reading Cilla's review, I thought I was up for an amusing ""best and worst"" of a gothic and would give it a try. Despite the review's warning, I was not prepared. For a short while, I toyed with the idea the author was going for a spoof of gothics. If so, it's a complete miss. This is more like a disjointed, crazy and unexplainable dream. Many things irritated me e.g., the heroine disappears for 18 months, has a baby, leaves new baby with a friend and goes off to assist Florence Nightengale(!). I kept waiting for this to have some relevance to the story. It doesn't although it's mentioned several times.On the good side, it's a very quick read."
1,"BIG DOGS IN THE PICTURE, SMALL HARNESS",It pays to read the fine print. I ordered what I thought was a harness to fit my lab because of the pictures of the dogs on the ad. WRONG! I read NOW that the one I ordered won't fit his paw. Why would I pay 22 bucks for a TRAVEL harness on a pet that would fit in my purse... Live and learn. Now I have to ship it back and wait months to get a partial refund. Never again!
3,"Easy, but insubstantial","These soup cups are relatively quick and easy to prepare, but they hardly suffice for a stand-alone meal as the label claims. Could be a good value, though, if you supplement it."
2,Product is good but not exceptional,"For the price it is a great bargain.You get a leather case as well as car charger for $12.99.The leather case is little bit tight .The car charger is not very elegantly designed but serves the purpose.Now when i got the product,the packaging box read T616.I have a T610 and had no provision to specify my model when purchasing the superior comm leather case and car charger product.So when i read the packaging title,i was taken aback.Amazon and superior comm assured me that they have the same charger for both T616 AND T610.The charger and case work ok for my phone."
1,Item was lost,The item was never delivered to me. I contacted the seller and never received a reply.
1,not good,"We bought this toy for $[...] at a tag sale and I thought I was getting a steal. Two weeks later, we left it out on the street. It's hard and heavy and almost impossible to turn. No good at all. Total disappointment b/c it looks so nice."
4,Iona - New Age-ish Concept Album,"""Shores"" was Iona's 3rd studio album. The album is somewhat conceptual in nature based around the story of Irish navigator St Brendan who is said to have discovered America from Ireland long before Columbus. Iona have always mixed progressive rock with Celtic and New Age influences. On this album the new age quotient seems to be a bit higher than some of their other discs. There are also a few outright pop tunes, which are very well done. Guitarist Dave Bainbridge shines on several of these tracks as does saxophonist Mike Haughton. Joanna Hogg's impressive vocals soar above it all. Although this is not my favorite Iona release it is a solid album and should appeal to those who like the more mellow atmospheric aspects of the band."
2,Not the one to get,"I had such high hopes in getting this CD. Being still somewhat new to classical music, I listen to associates for new ideas. Kurt Masur was recommended to me as a very good conductor and interpreter. With this in mind, when I bought this CD I hoped to be wowed. I wasn't. First let me just say boo to ""La Valse"". The ending just doesn't ignite like it's supposed to. Instead of the caustic ending I have grown to love I hear a bland ending without the Byronic element. Same with Bolero. The redeeming features of the CD are the Debussy pieces--and then only somewhat. Bottom line.....there are better recordings to buy."
3,Nice but cracks easily,"Even though they are supposed to be microwave safe, these dishes crack very easily in the microwave."
5,Excellent choice for home cordless phones,"Like many of us, I recently chose to get my telephone service as part of a cable,internet,phone package. It was an additional charge to hook up to the existing home telephone wiring so I decided on the Pana Kx-TG1034S. I disabled the answering machine since I have voice mail (very easy to do) hook the base unit to the cable modem and - the phones work perfectly. No additional setttings needed - all handsets are pre-programmed to work together. Really easy to transfer calls between units - and excellent voice quality. The displays are easy to read and battery life seems great. Highly recommended."
1,Had one phone out of 4 that just wouldn't work,"I bought these phones because my brother had the same ones and loved them. They seemed to work fine for a few days, then one of the handsets just died. Customer service for Panasonic is pretty awful, and emails take 4 days to get a response. After doing much troubleshooting, I was told I would have to return the unit to Panasonic and they would send me a refurbished one. This phone is only 10 days old...why would I return it for a reburished one. Customer service phone was no better, and finally I hung up. Too bad because these phones seemed to work great, except that the volume doesn't go too high, and also it was impossible to change the ringer tone, even though it was supposed to be changeable."
3,great for the money,"like the phones, not thrilled with the limited ring tones though, also interferes with the baby monitors when it rings, or anytime that you hang up on a call."
2,VERY UNHAPPY,"Like several others, I Have Vonage & bought this because I needed the additional handsets. The range is short causing the handsets to drop calls or not even ring SOMETIMES. It's not consistent in terms of in (or out of) range. I've had this system for 2 months and originally got good performance using the speakerphones. Now 80% of the time, I have to take the call off speaker because the person on the other end hears very digitized sounds and cannot make out my words. I'll contact Panasonic to see what they can do."
4,Panasonic,"Everything is fine except for the wall mount, it sits up way too high. It's hard to read and looks really ugly."
5,Panasonic Phones,This phone system is just what I needed to get a phone in several rooms. It has worked fine and the set up instructions were clear and easy to follow.
1,PHONE BEEPS AND HAS HOLLOW SOUND!,"I tried to contact the seller of this item, but got no response. Said they were on vacation. I am using two of the phones since these are the only ones I have! Will not buy from this seller again."
5,Excellent telephones,"I have had the phone set for about a month now and am very pleased with it. After purchasing the phones, I found them highly rated by Consumers Reports. Bob Smeaton, Fernandina Beach, Fl"
2,"eh, not bad, but not exciting.","First of all, the key pad is not backlit. This is a big flaw for me. The battery life is indeed outstanding, but the range is perhaps only very slightly better than my 5.8 GHz uniden. I find the uniden design much more pleasant too, easier to figure out how to operate the phone - much more intuitive.All in all, I would say that if battery life is a huge priority for you, go for this. Otherwise, a 5.8 Ghz will do the job too, and be cheaper."
5,A Remarkable Bargain,It arrived quickly and was very easy to assemble and install. Due to the inexpensive cost of this product I thought it would be a cheap imitation of a cordless phone. I was wrong. It was very easy to set-up and works perfectly in all rooms. The batteris are inexpensive and it has every feature anyone would need in a cordless phone.
1,I want a refund,Shortly after receiving this phone system the charger stopped working. I contacted Panasonic (02/12/2009)and was told that a replacement would be sent on 03/15/2009. I have still not received the replacement part and they have not responded to my inquiry since. It is 04/15/2009. My wife often complains about the keys sticking on several of the units while dialing out and that the hearing is scratchy.Can I return these items?
5,"Nice product, meets our needs",Eliminated 3 different wireless phones and in the process eliminated the noise on the line. Very satisfied.
2,Disappointing range,You can't be far from the base unit to use this phone. It's quite surprising. I wouldn't buy it again.
1,Talk and then it starts beeping and no more conversation,"Love the phones other than when my wife and I both try to both talk to someone like a relative. Whoever picks up the phone first, great, the second person that picks up another phone, after about 1 - 2 minutes, the second phone just starts beeping and you can no longer hear any conversation. Then you have to turn the phone off, and back on again, and you can talk for another minute or two, then more constant beeping. Turn it off again. The batteries are good, fully charged, and the base, is about 20 feet away, no further than the other phone that's in use."
1,"The real playbook is,,,, fake reviews","This is book is clearly a slapdash effort to get published. If it were from academia it would be the product of the ""publish or perish"" mentality. There are a few useful bits of information, but finding them is hard and they would be best condensed into a magazine article. The writing style demands, not comands, attention. Don't expect a page-turner here.While I won't recommend this book, as a first effort from the authors it is not that bad. What is sad, though, is that this website was salted with positive reviews, probably from friends. Maybe this is the hidden play in the playbook, taken from Microsoft's PR department, meant to make a second-rate product look good. They impugn book the book and the site.Summary: First, don't judge this book by online reviews. Second, wait for the 2nd edition."
5,"wonderful, clever approach to the masters",I have this CD. Bought it at a Sedaka concert. His clever words have you singing to the classics. I have many friends who want to buy my CD from me because they cannot find it anywhere in the US. Please get this back in stock so everyone can enjoy the classics. Sedaka takes the classics out of the dentist chair and onto the Pop charts.
2,"Not competitive, with strangely sluggish conducting from Sinopoli","This Carmen is a miss on most cylinders. Sinopoli, who should have been as great in the pit as ever, conducts a listless, often dragging reading. Lamore is almost an alto, and her deep, chocolate tones sound neither young nor seductive. Moser is a workaday tenor with nothing to offer interpretatively--he just stood in because no one better was available, I suppose. All in all, a disappointment in eveyr department."
4,Inspiration to practice rudiments!,"I wasn't expecting much from a drummer who, while excellent, has generally played in free form, jamming type music. I was very surprised.Ginger does an excellent job of showing how the very basic rudiments are all you need to become a master drummer on the drumset. He applies about a dozen or so rudiments but then shows how simple variations on them can really sound unique -- and that describes his drumming style, unique and approaching a John Bonham like simple sound which is deceptively complicated.If you want a constant motivation to practice your rudiments, this will give it to you. It does for me -- after 15 years of drumming."
1,its not worth it,"Cheap cables. Everything in the box its cheap. And if u want to turn it back, it most be in box close. So theres not way. I recommend to u to spend a little more in a good cables. Its not woth it. Crap."
2,RCA needle broken!,"I just wanted to give me input on this product by DB LINK. First and foremost the quality of the power cables are very nice. However, I noticed the inside needle of the blue RCA jack had completely broken off the amp. This is very sad considering this had just been installed in my vehicle yesterday and was working fine for about 15 mins. I would be glad to raise the rating on this item if the company provides a replacement RCA and also promises on developing a stronger cable for future customer."
4,good but...,remeber its only 17ft. hardly enough for a 1990 cadillac deville. wire is easy to work and is good quality
4,"good bit, but lack of bearing is a disadvantage","I bought this about 2 years ago and used it to make about a dozen raised panels. It's a good bit and creates very smooth, beautiful profiles. I usually take 3 to 4 passes to remove all the material (that's when using 3/4"" mahagony). I've used the bit together with the freud set 97-106 and it works very well. However, the bit's main disadvantage is it lacks a bearing which makes it impossible to use this on an arched panel - at least I'm not aware of a safe way to use a 3.5"" bit without bearing without a fence.... so, anyone contemplating to buy this, I'd instead recommend to get the 99-519 bit."
2,Missing Chris in the Morning...,"This is such a shiny, perfectly cut, little studio album. It's not great, but it's not the worst. It's middle of the road with a couple of catchy tunes that make it a worthwhile purchase. The main problem seems to be that I find it hard to believe John Corbett, a man who I know to be a star of small and big screen, to have the knocks in life that you tend to hear about in country songs. Plus, every once in a while you hear his voice through the singing and you think, ""That's Chris in the Morning"" or ""That's Aidan"" and you can't listen to it anymore without it being weird."
5,John Corbettt Singing - What More Can You Ask of Him?,"Being a fan of Chris in the Morning, and being a fan of John Corbett in general, I really did enjoy the choice of songs, his voice and is playing on the album."
3,"Actually, 3.5 stars. Pretty good album, for an actor...","I've enjoyed Corbett's acting since the TV series ""Northern Exposure"" so when I found this in a bargain bin, used, for a buck, I grabbed it. While there are no ""masterpiece"" tracks here, just about everything is enjoyable enough for repeat play. He is country with a little rock and a little folk, and while his voice is not distinctive, like Johnny Cash or Randy Travis, it is more than good enough for these songs. The backing band is wonderful. This was a pleasant surprise, and if you are a fan of his movie and television work, add this and become a fan of his musical sensibilities."
5,It ROCKS!!,"If you are a fan of the Crue, you will love this DVD. It has a lot of extras too. The videos take you way back and then up to present. It was great trip down memory lane, and I rocked out the whole time."
2,Disappointing,I found the book disappointing. The story line was just not there. The style seemed to be a rewrite of a Rick Bass story years ago but didn't come up to Bass's quality. And the story perpetuated the stereo type of pepole from Maine.
2,"Poor Transfer, Missing Scenes","I was excited when I came across the Amazon notification of the pre-release of this DVD. Poor transfer, missing scenes, disappointment. When I saw the movie on television in '73 or '74 (as a teenager) it was probably one of the most moving films I'd ever seen. I'll keep hoping that someone locates a good copy and does it right."
2,Great movie - terrible DVD,"This appears to have been copied directly from an old tape to DVD, with no attempt to clean up the picture or sound. My fifteen year old VHS tape of the movie is much clearer and sharper than this DVD. In addition, I noticed a couple of scenes are missing. One is a bit of the opening that was taken from ""Memphis Belle"" (no great loss.) The other is the flashback scene in which the blind commando recalls the rescue mission during which he lost his sight.The movie, loosely based on two different WWII incidents, is terrific. If you haven't seen it, it's worth ordering this DVD at only eight bucks. But if you're hoping to replace your worn out VHS copy with a nice new DVD, save your money."
3,Colditz - Escape of the Birdmen,"I really enjoyed this movie when it came out and have waited for years for the DVD. Unfortunately, the quality of the recording is very poor. Still enjoyed the movie though."
1,An interesting subject that reads like a boring professor,"While the historical aspects of this book are interesting, the author expects you to know too much about the bible and religious philosphy and stresses signifigance without bothering to explain those aspects. It's almost as if the author is writing to impress his contemporaries and the vernacular is very onanistic. It's almost insulting. Imagine that you are in a very boring class, catching snippits of interesting info if can remain awake. Once again there are some interesting parts, but was ultimatly dissapointed after reading this book. This is not something to read if you are new or want to continue reading about this subject."
5,Iwo Jima: Portrait of a Battle,"I found this book to be an excellent source of information on the battle of Iwo Jima. Many of the superb pictures throughout the book helped illustrate the terrible carnage of the battle. An excellent book, which I first saw at the new Marine Corps Museum at Quantico, Virginia. Amazon's price was $14 off the list price of $40. Good show!"
3,Review of the 3rd Dimension,"Spy Kids 3-D is followed a year after Juni Cortez(Daryl Sabara)retires from the O.S.S..When Juni recieves an urgent messageof news about his sister Carmen(Alexa Vega)being trapped inthe latest video game,""Game Over"",he decides it is all up to himto rescue her.Battling through the 3-D world of pogo toads,robotarenas,mega races,fighting with glowing staffs and lava monsters,Juni is assisted by his grandpa(Ricardo Montalban)succeeding in finding Carmen and shutting down the game.Butmatters only got worse when the toymaker(Sylvester Stallone)breaks free of Cyber Space as he releases huge robots(in 3-d ofcourse)into the city.But of course Juni and Carmen find it to easy to out-smart them as they call in the family and the familyfriends.However a happy ending occurs when grandpa helps the toymaker realise he is good not bad.I like Spy Kids 3-D but asa matter of fact I really like Spy Kids2!"
4,Good for the kids,"My four year old son begged me for this movie as many of his friends at school kept talking about it. I had passed this movie over several times thinking it was too old for him. I finally gave in and purchased it for him. He LOVES it. It is so funny to see him sitting there so intense with the glasses on. The plot line was a little boring for me to watch, but the 3D effects were better than I thought they would be. They are definitely not as good as you find at Theme Parks such as the Muppets at Disneyland, etc, but they are respectable. Most of the movie takes place inside a video game which is why it really didn't appeal to me, but for kids it's great."
2,Bad Movie,My kids asked to watch this movie. It's plot is bad and the graphics appear to be from the 80's. Do yourself a favor and skip it.
2,Spy Kids 3D Major Letdown!,"Robert Rodriguez has made movies in the past that I loved. Desperado, Sin City, From Dusk Til Dawn. The 1st Spy Kids movie. These filmshad good plots, good acting and were original. It showed me that he was a major talent. Spy kids 3d shows me that Mr. Rodriguez has puthis talent on the back burner in exchange for the almighty buck. The 3d is a joke. Sly Stallone is just sad to watch. Alexa Vega(the other half of the Spy Kids) doesn't show up until the last half hour of the movie and Antonio Banderas and the rest of the Spy Kids cast from other movies don't show up until the last 10 minutes! Mr. Rodriguez needs to return to his roots and make films about peopleinteracting with each other and hang up the green screen until he starts Sin City 2."
2,correction to year range,Sadly this DOES NOT work for all the models listed. I found out the hard way. My 1996 Volvo 850 uses a different connector and this item was not able to help me adapt it (to hook up my new car receiver).Booo hisss
5,A movie worth crying over,"A real tearjerker of a movie, and I say that in a good way. This was a story about the problems with immigration policy, the poor and class economic struggles, and a father son relationship much like the one in the very good, Bronx Tail. The lead character played the father in an understated but powerful way and the son somehow pulled off the tough guy act despite looking like such a sweet kid. A superb and surprising ending brought on the tears, egual to Rudy, and it was based on true emotion, and a real life situation. The ending was totally satisfying and appropriate. Go see this movie!"
1,Horrible!,The sticks don't stay in and my star cookie broke when I tried taking them out of the sheet. A total waste of money!
2,Alaska Fishing: Floating & Fishing Alaska's Aniak River,This video is quite repetiious and very amateurish in it's making. There is no flyfishing in this video only spin fishing for you flyfishers who are considering it.
5,Another magnificent recording from the young Vengerov.,"WOW! I must start by saying i own atleast eight recordings of this peice and i must say that i like this one the most out of all the rest.To perform this music well, one must have an uncontrollable passion for it and Vengerov exeeds all standards of uncontrollable passion.Generally my favorite voilinist is David Oistrakh but when i had to compare which recording i liked better, i had to chose the Vengerov recording, conducted by one of OIstrakh's own collegues, Rostropovich himself.What makes this recording stand out is the texture that the passion produces between the orchestra and the violin. It produces a distinktly Russian sound unparalelled by any other recording i know of. I hardely recommend this recording to all music lovers!"
3,My First LeapPad book: Cars,"This is a hot subject with our 2 & 4-year old grandchildren. Disappointingly it does not work properly with our My First LeapPad and the children quickly lost interest in the book. I believe it is the LeapPad itself that is at fault, resulting in the low rating for the books. The book itself would be great!"
4,Good addition to the LeapPad collection,4 year old daughter has always enjoyed her LeapPad and is a big fan of Mater. This was a fun addition for her.
1,Boring,My daughter loves everything Lightening McQueen and this toy bores her. Spend your money on something else.
3,"Not bad, but not quite up to par with previous work","""Redemption"" is Grits' final album with Gotee Records, as they will be going independent. This disc is a departure from the mostly rapid-fire pace of the Dichotomy A & B albums which I loved. This disc's slower, more laid back style just doesn't grab me on most cuts. However, the skillful rhyme-spitting and vocal tones are still there for Coffee and Bonafide, and they made a great move in including former LA Symphony member Pigeon John on two cuts, ""Open Bar"" which features a smooth track and chorus, and ""You Said"" which features PJ dropping clever sing-song style rhymes in a song about ill-fated relationships. The female backing vocals are also strong, but Pigeon John steals the show on these two tracks. The disc is just ok, but worth having in my opinion even if just for the two previously mentioned songs."
5,Neem Oil is GOOD stuff!,"This is highly concentrated... I have given some to my son and to a couple of neighbors! Neem is good stuff for your plants, helps get rid of bugs and is edible so it doesn't bother pets or you, its a planet friendly green product!I couldn't find it local, I always try to BUY LOCAL - it helps your community and the local merchants to stay in business! Plus seeing what you are buying always helps! Now I have found Neem Oil locally so depending on the price, and the product I might not order anymore from here. But when I did order through Amazon it came quickly and was very reasonably priced."
2,"Simple Call, not that SIMPLE","Can""t get unit to work, not sure if it's me or the unit, can hear on it OK, when I send a Call on Skype, my modem gets disconnected..."
2,I'd rather watch Barney.,"Half way through this movie, my 12-year old daughter said, ""I'd rather watch Barney."" It fails even as a B-movie because it tries too hard . The plot is lame in it's predictability and the acting is forgettable. Some of the best parts of the original novel were left out. The redeeming feature is that it did not have a comedic ending."
3,Smile,Story Line not too bad but other wise not much to this movie as far as collecting. Some good action.
5,great product,"epson archival matt is excellent, plus free and prompt shipping. best price on the planet"
4,Love It !,"Was born and raised in Southern Oklahoma and you don't hear Cherokee spoken where I live. You hear English and Spanish. So I decided to get this book and learn it. Perhaps teach it to my son , and nieces and nephews. I have had it for about a week now and I am already able to say quite a few things. With this book and the internet is a good combination when learning.(cherokeelessons.com is Western) Leaning with just the book by would be difficult. When using the book , and the internet. You need to pay close attention to which is Eastern , and Western Dialect. or you'll be confused on how to say certain words. I really have enjoyed the exercises in the book. Over all I give it 4 stars , for the simple fact there is no audio ,CD or DVD that comes with it.Wa-do!Do-na-da-go-hv-i!-Masi"
5,well worth it,"I looked at this book at the bookstore and decided against buying it because the yellow titles bothered me. I was surprised then to receive it as a birthday gift a couple of weeks later. I am so glad, because it really is a fantastic collection, and I guess I've grown accustomed to the yellow; I don't even really notice it now. And I have been reading this book quite a bit. I have about 300 cookbooks but in the past few days, especially when cooking for Thanksgiving, I've reached for The Gourmet Cookbook rather than search through all the others for something in particular. The introduction to each recipe is engaging and informative. I made the All-Occasion Yellow Cake twice in the past two days because it took a very few minutes to make and my sons went crazy for it. All in all, if you love cooking and recipes and food, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to bypass this book."
3,Missing index,"Beware. My copy of this book was missing half the index, which stopped at ""M"", although it was a new product."
2,The Gourmet Cookbook,"I first ordered this book from my library to preview before I buy any books. When I opened it at the front desk and saw the pale yellow type for the recipes, I could not believe that any design/publishing house could do such a thing. As an artist and being in the ad business, it is totally unthinkable that the publishers would allow this to go to press.As many other reviewers have said, I am just adding to their dissatisfactions, and the size of the book does not make it easy to put on your kitchen counter to read/cook by.I have to say the lobster Newburgh with eggs and cream and NO flour is a classic, which gives it accolades!It was a truly heroic effort but missed it's mark."
1,Yellow Titles Make Book Difficult to Read,"I know that I am back on an old topic and many reviewers did not find the yellow titles a great concern, but I will not buy this book because I find it annoying to read. I was so disappointed by the low contrast in the recipe titles, and how hard it made to use the book, that I realized that even with all the interesting recipes, I would probably not use the book, and it would sit on a shelf. I have lots of not so great cookbooks doing that already, so why buy another."
2,The Gourmt Cookbook:More than 1000 recipes,"Wonderful service. Book is a great value for the money. However, I find the yellow/orange headings and notations very hard to read. They should change the color for the next printing.I had collected Gourmet magazine for years dating back to the 60's & 70's so these recipes are like old friends. Thank you.Jeanne C. Rakowski"
4,Secret Ingredient,"I've thumbed through this book many times, and there is a crucial thing that has been left out.The secret ingredient in every one of these recipes? Love.The second secret ingredient? It's a tie between Justice and goat cheese."
1,not happy,I did not recieve this product because your company can't figure out how to change or update an address so i will not enjoy this product. i was looking forward to them for i am working in a climate were winter is very cold and snows then summers are very hot and dry very rocky so thank you.
3,A strange book: near madness,"There is a certain 60's flavor to it. Surreal and sick, it makes one think of Kafka. The obsessive thoughts of the narrator about an accidentally deformed woman and images of hanging; a sparrow, a chicken, a block of wood,a cat ( his Lena's) and finally Louis, her husband in suicide. No oneseems to admit to being part of this strange impulsive pattern of behaviorthat borders on the psychotic. The narrative is like being trapped in a waking nightmare."
1,NOT A WIRELESS CONTROLLER - RETURNED UNOPENED!,The one posted review for this product compares it to the Wavebird. THIS IS NOT A WIRELESS CONTROLLER! Due to the lack of description BE CAREFUL!
2,Useless to me,I bought this filter because my monitor faces a big open window. On a sunny day it is very difficult to see anything because of so much glare reflected off the screen from outside.Apperenlty it is not designed to stop THAT type of glare but just glare ORIGINATING from the screen. If you have outside glare it is actually worse because it has an almost mirrored effect making it impossible to see the screen behind.If you are in a room where outside glare is not a problem then this will probably be OK.
4,Fine Drill Press...,"A fine bench drill press. It worked good for me...but I found that the belts could slip a bit. Also, as expected, the column depth can be limiting when trying to drill in certain areas."
3,Yah its alright,"I read another review which said the rope provided to secure the cover is not big enough to go around the pool (13 ft.), and you know what they were right. The cover works great when it stays on (we normally have to fish it out of the pool.) We will be buying a larger rope to secure the cover."
5,Budgie still rocks,"I haven't listen to any Budgie since the late 70's, not long ago my 13yr. old daughter was listening to Metallica's remake of Breadfan, I'd forgotten how Budgie rips so I pulled out the old LP's put on the Best of and enjoyed the great selection of songs! If your a Budgie fan this is a good representation on of early Budgie tunes. My daughter thinks it rocks!"
3,i agree,i got this book from a book club so i couldn't look at it ahead of time or i wouldn't have bought it. it has a lot of information that i already had in other books. the pics were nice and i did like the garden designs.
3,OK,"This is the second book I have read in this series....I thought it was OK. I felt that it lacked something. The story had no ups and downs, it stayed on an even keel the entire time. I am a big fan of romance fiction and I have read alot better."
4,This book replaced a 4 year old's blanket,"The son of a friend is crazy about construction equipment. I gave this book to him for Christmas 1998. He had everyone read some sections of the book to him that day. It's been his constant companion since then at overnight's to his grandparents.Although intended for a much different audience, this book can be a real hit with younger readers because of the great pictures."
2,Much worse than OEM,"Was hoping to get these to replace the tired trunk lid struts on my 850i, but they barely did a better job. Replaced with OEM which worked far better."
2,"Adequate, but not of superior quality.","I placed an order for two of these items. One of the items was packaged in too small of a box, and arrived mangled and missing a hanger. I am returning the damaged item for replacement. Using this project is not a one-person job. It requires two people: one person to hold the puzzle stable, and one person to apply the ""stickers"" that hold the pieces together. In addition, the stickers are a bit challenging to trim to the exact size of the puzzle, as the adhesive tends to ""gum up"" the scissors/craft knife."
5,Great Option vs Glue,"My kids bought me a couple puzzels of my favorite sport teams. I used this product to frame the puzzle instead of getting puzzle glue. Very easy, no mess and results look great in the frame. Amazon was also the lowest price I could find for the product as well."
5,puzzle presto,"Worked very good, still needed to put huge puzzle in a glass frame for hanging but it stayed together very nicely"
2,Very difficult to apply,"MAKE SURE if you cut this product down to fit a smaller puzzle, that you don't cut off the edge that says Peel from this side!! There is a line running down the paper that you bend back to peel the backing off with...nearly IMPOSSIBLE without that bending line!As for performance? Meh. I will be framing the puzzles as wall decor for my son's room, so they'll be fine, but I can't imagine just sticking the included ""hangers"" (small piece of thick plastic with a hole on one side, and double stick tape on the other) on the back & hanging them that way.This is average, no better. And at a per puzzle price, not really cost effective."
1,Failed shortly after purchase,"When I'm home, I'm usually wearing slippers. You'd be surprised how challenging it is to find quality slippers. I mistakenly thought that these would fill that bill. Instead, about 4 months after I bought them, the bottoms started to crack. The tops and side stitching all have stayed in place, but the soles are tattered remnants of their former selves.The search for high quality slippers continues."
1,how should i know,i recently started to work in a cigar store and i thought what better way to get some information then to purchase a book from amazon. But my book never came granted i was refunded the money i lost the information from the book that i never got to read. im sure its a great book thought
1,A Waste Of Paper,"In this day and age, how can anyone take this book seriously? To rate hitters by batting average is simply a waste of effort because on-base percentage and slugging percentage correlate far better with scoring runs and winning games than batting average."
2,For Nerds Only!,"BOOKLIST claims that ""buried within every true baseball fan is a Nerd with a calculator and a scorecard"" - a statement mildly amusing if not deeply offensive to 80-90% of the nation's dedicated baseball fans. There is far, far more to this beautiful game than mere number-crunching. Try poetry, drama, romance, myth, legend, simple competitive excitement. This book seems to miss the other 80-plus percent of the game and those other 80-plus percent of the readers and fans. And even for those who would rather sit in front of their computers than in the outfield bleachers, the author's measure of hitting greatness is at best the most narrow possible measure - the standard but highly unrevealing category of batting averages. There is much ado about nothing here."
1,Disappointing book,"Mr. Schell's book on baseball will disappoint nearly all ordinary baseball fans. It is loaded with statistical analysis that is nonintuitive and produces very counterintuitive results. For Mr. Schell, it seems that the facts must be made to fit the theory rather than the other way round. To be sure, some of the ways that are used to judge hitting prowess are not merely innovative but highly illuminating. But we don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The idea that Tony Gwynn is the best hitter of all time and that Babe Ruth is far down in the standings is going a bit too far.Mr. Schell has a more more recent book that will seem more sensible to most fans. It gives weight to slugging ability or so-called power hitting and restores Ruth to a high place in the pecking order and drops Gwynn to a spot we can believe in."
3,mystery/circus,"Since this was a very old film, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. However, if you are a circus fan, you might enjoy it."
5,One of the funniest books I have ever read.,This is one of the all time favorite bedtime stories at my house.
3,sequel to The Lightning Time,"This is a sequel to Gregory Maguire's book The Lightning Time. The boy from Lightning Time is on vacation, and is taken to see various people's dreams by a bird. Not as good as The Lightning Time (or I Feel Like the Morning Star, a very haunting book by the same author), but good - definitely better than the average children's book. It has a good sense of mystery and wonder."
2,"liked the concept, did not like the book","I loved the whole concept of ""investigating"" comic book culture but i just got bored with this book...It might be a good book if you intend to write an essay (it reads like one long essay) but there is no theme, no story, no news, no conviction...where is the author? What is running in his head? What does he want to tell us apart from the fact that there is such a thing as ""comic book culture""?Okay...so there is a culture...why read the book?"
1,Lame!!,"I got this toy for Christmas and let me tell you. It is so CUTE! It's extremely fun. For about 24 hrs! The door broke off before 5 min. was up! I mean, its little rubber hamsters in a doll house! Cute? Yes. Fun? Not unless you buy 15 other sets to get enough hamsters to have any FUN. The thing only comes with Hamtaro! I expected to get ALL the Ham-Hams with it! I recommend ages 4-7! I suggest toy collectors and no higher than 2nd grade. Love the show. Hate the house."
5,Love theses tables,"Was looking to replace my old set this is the third set of tables in 20 years. I have had the colors oak, cherry and now black which goes in my family room that is scarlet gray and black so well. Was easy to assemble and fun to watch the game and have your table right there."
4,Great for the price but.....,"This set is great for the price I paid. It arrived fast and was very easy to assemble. It took my 15-20 minutes to set up. The only problem that I have is that when closing the tray, it's not smooth and I have to repeatedly lift and close until it finally fully closes. I feel like it may break if I use a little force to close it so I try not to. But as I said earlier, it is a great product for the price."
2,Decent.,One of the packages arrived with the box torn open and missing pieces to create the stand on which the tables stood.
5,for the money -- great buy,"after reading some of the horrible reviews, i was really hesitant in buying these trays. But compared to the prices i saw elsewhere i figured they were worth the 70 bucks (free shipping). Im glad i did, they are simple easy to use table trays ... i wasnt expecting custom wood with excellent castle style finishes becasue i didnt pay for that. For the complainers (always are going to be some) you get what you pay for, the trays are fine, do the job but arent idiot prooof. If you push the table it falls, if you put too many plates they wont fit, if you bang them they will scratch.its a good buy for the price, if you want mahogany wood or other similar high priced woodwith excellent finishes, contact a woodssmith and get ready to pay more then 70.cheers"
5,A Useful Multi-tasker,"The beans are in and these little shears snip the ends off faster than anything. Yes, they're great for herbs, but also for other kitchen tasks. Any time my regular kitchen scissors get mislaid, I can reach for these shears as my backup pair. The multi-blade herb shears may be great for herbs, but not for opening a pouch of frozen veggies or liberating an individually packaged fillet.These shears can be locked closed and hung from a hook so they are always in easy reach. I use them to harvest herbs from my Aerogarden (AeroGrow AeroGarden with Gourmet Herb Seed Kit, Black) or my summer deck planters as well as cutting the herbs into small pieces. The little container actually works quite well for mincing and measuring, but I more often just cut things 'freehand' directly into the pot or salad. The spring action makes the cutting job easy. I'm pleased with this purchase and use the shears frequently. They are an excellent kitchen multi-tasker."
4,A solid greatest hits album...,"Because half of the band died several decades ago, Lynyrd Skynyrd has unfortunately unleashed a pile of greatest hits albums over the years. This happens to be one among many. I gave this particular album 4 stars because there is nothing to distinguish it from the rest.This release includes the vast majority of Skynyrd's best songs, including the obvious ones ""Freebird"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" as well as some slightly lesser known hits like ""The Ballad of Curtis Lowe."" Though every Skynyrd fan could probably list a few favorites that didn't make the cut, I was only disappointed with the absence of ""Simple Man."" Other than that, this is a great collection.Honestly, you're probably better off with another greatest hits album, as others are cheaper and more readily available. But if you stumble upon this one, it's solid."
4,Bruckner: Symphony No. 7 / Herreweghe,Bruckner: Symphony No. 7 / Herreweghe is a recording under the direction of Philippe Herreweghe who leads the Orchestre des Champs-Èlysées on this harmonia mundi s.a. recording from 2004. Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs has written the music notes. The notes are also available in German and French. A very nice recording played on period instruments. Highly recommended. 5/5.
3,Good summer read,"I enjoyed this installment of the Chicago detective VI Warshawski. The mystery was well drawn and tight; while clues abound, they are not obvious and the story also brings in a lot of interesting items re the patriot act. So this is both entertaining and worthwhile. I do have a quibble with the author which I have to be circumspect with, since I don't want to give anything away. Let's just say that one character's death is an awfully easy out so that certain political issues don't, in the end, have to be dealt with. But I can see that it was almost inevitable, given the impossibility of resolution re this character. At any rate, I recommend the book. Enjoy."
2,Too Long and Involved,"...for no reason. I have read all of the V.I. novels and didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. I just wanted it too end. It seemed to ramble and it could have been shortened extensively and still maintained it's mystery and characterizations. So convoluted - I had a hard time keeping up with some of the characters, especially the Bayards vs the Drummonds vs ... I ended up skipping the last 3 chapters and going to the end to find out who murdered the journalist out of boredom and frustration. Ms. Paretsky must have been paid by the word for this one..."
1,Drowning in political commentary,"I've read a few VI Warshawski books and thought I'd enjoy this one, but this is the last one I'll read. The political commentary is absolutely overwhelming. I'm 250 pages into the book and so sick of it I may not finish. Can you imagine not finishing a murder mystery? That's how tiresome this is."
1,Forget the politics.,"If I want to read a bunch of liberal drivel, I will buy a political book. This story could have been told without all the bashing of the present administration. It was not relevant to the story and was distracting. I found the whole book to be rambling and incoherent. Very disappointing for a former Paretsky fan."
4,Bought as a gift - Very Satisfied,"I bought this as a gift for my father who has always been a fan of NASCAR, and Petty in particular. Though I haven't watched it myself, my father loved it and only said good things."
1,768 pages of ponderously disappointing fiction,"As a James Dickey fan, I was looking forward to immersing myself in Alnilam. The start was slow but optimistically I looked forward to something satisfying - I slogged through this disappointment until the bitter end. The one star I gave it (my first inclination was no stars for the pitiful plot and tedious narrative but that was not an option...) was only for some of the character development which was interesting at times. What a waste of a tree (well, with 768 pages, many trees)."
2,Bad 80s? No Thanks,"Except for Zakk Starkey on drums, there is no reason to buy this album. The vocals are a bad Paul Rodgers copy and the songs are a cross between Mr. Mister and the Outfield, minus the commerical success. The late Mr. Entwistle should be comended for trying to form another group after the Who ""broke up,"" but this was really a stiffing of his personality for the sake of pop music that didn't go anywhere. The album really doesn't hold up well and there's only one song up to the standards of older Entwistle compositions. Hell, when I saw the Rock on tour in '87, they could barely make it through the set. Even John had enough and left the stage half way through the set. Buy another Entwistle album."
4,Great work tool,The tool does a lot of work steady will cut the larger tiles. Not as noisy as some of the smaller machines. Needs some space to use and is a little heavy for one guy to move around well.
4,A balanced viewpoint,"Sonder gives a balanced view of the controversy between these two camps. His background information is clear, compelling and easy to follow. A thin book, only 112 pages, it focuses on defining what each side believes. I learned, for instance, what the three basic tenets of Fundmentalism are, how religious contemporaries viewed Darwin (not as virulently as one might now think) and why Evolutionist make no efforts to counter the claims made by Creationist. It is easy to read; a high school student would have not trouble with it. Its photos are basic black-and-white, which somewhat dates and detracts from the book. Overall, I came away with the feeling that most Americans are a lot closer to each other in the belief of how life developed on earth and that only the radical wings of both camps are so very far apart."
4,Trains at their best,This book tells the story of the passage of change when steam engine locomatives were replaced with the diesel engines of today. The book goes into extraordinary detail about the workings of old fashioned steam engines as well as weaves a compelling story about some of the people who were effected by this historic transition.
1,Gooood joke,"Big Tymers did a new lp. so what? Everybody knows, that they'll never move lyrically or musically. It's the same s*** all the time, just the hooks and titles changes. But wait! One innovation I found: featuring of R. Kelly! N****s please! I can't listen more to this s**** about girls, flow, gangstas. Track ""Gangsta Girl"" is one of the most idiotic I've ever heard.And if somebody going to tell me that I'm a hater, I'll say f***you, and listen to this! BT are just faking wannabes, they have no talent. One word: garbage."
2,too close to expiration,product too close to expiration date!need a way to determine/specify expiration in advance of actual purchase of the product.
2,One Touch,I these expecting the product to be as pictured instead I relieve boxes that had a different print and low and behold there made for Europe and Great Britian. At least be honest and tell me it's not from the states.
1,Questionable Quality,"Mine came with the holes drilled in the ladder rails and base such that the base could not possibly be correctly attached, which made me wonder about the construction quality of the ladder as a whole. I returned it, but haven't decided which other brand I might try, though I definitely wouldn't buy another Werner."
3,Got to be Honest,"I really do love this series but this volume felt more forced in plot and contrived. The plot was still interesting however and this volume has the scariest drawing of a ghost in the entire series thus far! It's really creepy with a woman coming down from a ceiling a pulling a syth out of her mouth. I think the biggest turn off in the volume is that the monk was actually a musician with being a monk part time? One word - weird.Overall, there is really interesting dialouge (oh that is so not spelled right) on PK abilities and fradulent PK. Plus you find out more on Naru's assistant. If you are a fan of the series you'll probably get it just to follow the story, but as a stand alone volume it isn't fantastic."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have just boxed this item up for a return trip to toolcrib. On it's first use which just happened to be today the spring loaded foot gave way, my laser hit the floor and 2 of the cheap glue joints on the pole came apart. This is truly a cheap piece of junk that will not stay in my tool inventory."
4,Penny Nichols Finds a Clue,"This is the first volume in the Penny Nichols mysteries. In this mystery, Penny helps her detective father capture some thieves who are stealing car parts. Although Penny is a teenager, she was able to come up with information in solving the crime that even the police and some of her father's fellow detectives couldn't come up with. An enjoyable read. No one is murdered in this mystery. This book can be read in a day."
4,Great s-video switcher but...,"Sony makes good hardware, that's no secret. And this little s-video switch is worth the price. It's solid, works like it should, and doesn't degrade the signal passing through it whatsoever. My only complaint is that the built in headphone jack included has no volume control slider or knob. That's kind of stupid when you have say a video game console feeding into the s-video switch, then you have no way to control the volume from the switch itself, and have to use an inline attenuator instead. Despite that, this is a quality s-video switch and it's worth the extra money to have Sony quality. The headphone jack issue has nothing to do with the RCA audio of course."
5,Rubbermaid 2970/2983 Dishpan,"Mine was made in Canada and it finally just started cracking around the rim. I've had it for years, so it was well worth whatever price I paid for it. Unfortunately I can't find a black one because they're not making black right now. Or red or any other useful color for my particular kitchen color scheme. So I'm using a smaller one made by a different maker. It's just a fraction too small for my dishes to fit. I hope Rubbermaid starts making black dishpans again soon. Or red... However, if I could find even a blue one that's the right size, I'd be very happy! The original was a tan color, but my kitchen has gone through some changes and I'd really love to have one that blended-in better!"
1,Wrong info,"It's probably not fair to give only one star to this item because we never even opened the package. But if you're expecting a speaker phone, look elsewhere. We got this for an 88- and 93-year-old because it sounded simple and said it had hearing-enhanced technology that made voices very clear. It also supposedly was able to be used as a speaker phone. Sorry, Charlie. Apparently they do have a phone that can be used as a speaker phone, but in spite of user reviews, this model wasn't it."
5,"Good, simple phone","This is a really nice, simple phone. It's small, so doesn't take up too much space on desktop. It has caller id, call waiting button, and a good speakerphone. The battery lasts an amazingly long time off the charger. I didn't use it much, and it lasted over a week."
4,CAN GET THIS FOR LESS THAN HALF THIS AMOUNT,"I started to buy this and went to check out, saw the nearly $20 shipping fee so cancelled and started looking elsewhere. Ended up buying on Ebay brand new from 100%seller for $32.00 and $11.00 to ship.Also found at Office Depot for around the same price as Ebay, but didn't know if it was a refurb so went with Ebay.This seller here is charging WAY too much, and the shipping is outrageous."
3,Good with bugs,"The good: excellent sound quality, easy to use and program.The bugs: time and date keep changing. Phone locks up and will only work again after removing battery and reinserting. After removing, sometimes have to reenter personal phone book.This is my second phone, first returned within 30 days for replacement, no questions asked.For me the excellent sound quality overrides the bugs for now."
4,Investing - Beginners,This is a rather good book for beginning investors. It is also quite good for those who have been investing for a few years or so. It shows a sound and rational way to invest. Methodical and well thought out.
2,Doesn't fly well,"The kite goes up very easily but unfortunately comes down very easily even in a strong wind. For no apparent reason, this kite simply drifts downward to the left or right and often doesn't stop until it hits the ground. Id' say it's pretty useless. UPDATE: The flew very straight and high yesterday in a 7 MPH wind. Unfortunately, the kite handle was dropped and the kite continued flying upwards and straight until the handle snagged at the top of a tree. The kite continued to fly well, but we had to leave and the kite was lost. So it's not clear to me that the kite has a problem after all. I won't buy another though -- too many single string kites lost in trees."
2,Unrealistic expectations?,"The title of this book is somewhat misleading - Brazelton and Greenspan have outlined a set of needs which, although qualitatively reasonable, are quantitatively outside the reach of most families - in all areas of the world , for all of human history. The economic necessity for parents to work most of the day, either in or outside the home, is not a function of modern western society, as is presumed by the authors. This being the case, to claim that active face-to face play with an unoccupied adult for most of a baby or toddlers waking hours is an irreducible need, appears somewhat bizarre. Remember, there has been an enormous range of child-rearing practices throughout human history, and most of them have turned out generally competent adults - children are more robust than Brazelton and Greenspan give them credit for."
5,A Must!!!!,"Anyone who works out should read this book! I don't know why more people do not use zone training...but it is really the most common sense, safe, and effective way to train. I have recommended this book to many. Easy to read and incorporate. Also recommend the Timex Heart Rate Monitor watch as well. She has written the booklet in it as well."
4,The Size Is Right,"ALMOST everything you need in a Computer Tool Kit. And the compact size fits into the accessory pocket of my laptop bag. Handy.Bought it from Amazon because their price was right and Customer Service the best.But WAIT! There's MORE! This nifty little kit is not just for computers. Buy an extra one and stash it in the kitchen junk drawer so you don't have to fish around for a pair of longnose pliers or a screwdriver for those quick fixes. Handy tools, all in one place - WHATTA CONCEPT! Lots of uses around the house - Not just in that computerbox you sit with for hours on end."
5,Exceptional,"This level has become an indespensible member of my construction business. It is inexpensive enough so that you do not have to treat it with kid gloves (and tough enough), while still being accurate enough to use for all types of elevation and leveling situations.The Remote with speed control is great (as long as you don't break the antenna...)The beam is bright enough for all outdoor applications.I was afraid that this was a toy, don't worry - it is not."
4,"""Dammit"" one of 98's best releases","This is a phat album altogether, but ""Dammit"" is a showcase of what blink does best."
5,The Greatest Song!,"I absolutely LOVE this song! It's the greatest, especially in the context of someone graduating, I mean, ""This Is Growing Up"" is the perfect title. By any means, listen to this song!"
5,Essential!,"This is an excellent guide to organizing a plan of attack for admission to a Top-20 MBA program. With competition among extraordinary people increasing annually for admission to b-school, you need a comprehensive marketing plan like the Carpenters describe. The interviews w/ students and admissions officers were candid and more informative than any other such interviews I have seen."
3,BRAHMS SIN NOVEDAD,"Las interpretaciones de la Sinfonías de Brahms por Kurt Masur, en realidad no tienen nada de malo, pero tampoco nada relevante. Dentro de esta misma literatura tenemos versiones mucho mejor logradas. Antes de comprar Masur mejor busque una de estas otras: Karajan / Berlín, Toscanini / NBC, Bernstein / Viena, Abbado / Berlín, Walter / Columbia."
5,Excellent book made me go out and by more of their books,"It was just the most interesting and heart rending piece of writing that i have read for a long time, the detail is just amazing it has lead me to go on to other places in england and america just to experience the places mentioned in the book, it also pushed me on to read destination disaster and falling star (which is out of print) and to buy their new book titanic a journey through time. What else can i say this book is very interesting to anyone interested in the titanic"
5,First time laying hardwood floor,"I really enjoyed using this tool. Since I've never put down a hardwood floor,I didn't know what to expect. I layed over 400 sq.ft. of Bamboo flooring and the tool performed great. Although the Bamboo is 5/8"" thick and the nailer is designed for 3/4"", I noticed two indentions on the flooring caused by the slight angle of the nailer, so I taped a piece of cardboard to the bottom to level it out and that took care of the problem. If the tool is supposed to work on 1/2"" to 3/4"" flooring, it should come with interchangeable pads to make it level when nailing. I had read other reviews about the nailer so all I had to do was make sure I didn't run out of nails and it worked great."
5,Eric,"Well, I just completed 500 sq feet using this nailer. It was terrific! The issue with the last nail straying never occurred. I was surprized to find that the remaining nail just dropped out without any problem. As for the use, it was very user friendly. I give this a thumbs up with delivery and quality."
1,Why Why Why?,"Why did I buy this disc? I know I'm not a fan of Barenboim's heavy-handed conducting, but I thought maybe it could work here. It doesn't. I give it one star because it's not as bad as his Mahler 5th. The Chicago Symphony is a great orchestra. They deserve a leader better than this."
1,one of the worst Tchaikovsky 4th on disc!,"No offence, but David Hurwitz you need to get your ears checked.This is terrible,barenboim has no clue how to conduct(interpretation)Tchaikovsky ridiculus tempos, phrasing of the melodies is a joke, to overblown one moment to dull and dead the next,his romeo and juliet isnt much better and the chicago symphony iv never thought has the right sound for his music,barenboim with his 6th symphony is a little better but not much and teldecs sound is BAD TO.Get Ormandy 1960 version,Dutiot Montreal/decca, GREAT VERSION."
1,Should be called Sub-Basic,"Very disappointed in this product... for this price, I expected more. There is no accompanying booklet to the lessons, forcing you to constantly pause to take notes on vocabulary, etc. The ""lessons"" are just the alphabet, numbers, time, question words, etc., without any useful examples to put them into sentences or any kind of context. Test material is also poor, not really helping to reinforce what was presented. All the material on this DVD is easily available on the internet (including pronunciations), so what's the point?"
1,not worth your dime,"The maker of this DVD series has no idea whatsoever about teaching and learning process...The material is lacking in almost every aspect. What is the point of making dvd if you are going to read the text on the screen, there are no dialogues just plain monologues, no interaction,no booklet...Stay away from this material. Its a total waste of money. The Philippine presentation was pictures scanned from postcards not even actual photos taken by the makers of this dvd."
2,Very Disappointing,"I've bought a number of these 'unofficial' DVD's made about other artists, and generally I think they are worth 4 stars. Queen's 70's and 80's Under Review I think are very good, as is Kate Bush's Under Review. These programs have concert footage, interviews with the artist(s), video clips and interviews with highly regarded music critics like Rolling Stone editor David Fricke.The Cure 1979-1989 two disc and book set is disappointing:* THE MUSIC IS NOT ORIGINAL! IT IS FROM SOME COVER BAND CALLED 'INSECURE'.* There are no interviews with the band.* There are no video clips.* It is only 45 minutes long.* The second disc contains music by 'Insecure'.The only footage of The Cure is three live tracks from 'The Top' and a variety of still photos.The only positive is the book. It gives a track-by-track overview of each album.Please Robert, allow an authentic film biography that covers your whole career. This is not worth the expense."
3,Microsoft Lifecam VX-3000,"Good for my use, talking to my son and grand daughter in Boston. Hate the istant messager button on the top-everytime you touch istant messager pops up, I use Skype. Quality is not that good of picture, I would opt for a higher resolution if purchasing again. For the price works great!"
1,LIFECAM VX-3000,LIFECAM LOOKS GOOD IN THE BOX AND THAT IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE IT BECAUSE IF YOU ARE RUNNING VISTA IT WILL NOT WORK. THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT RUN AND IF YOUR READ THE REVIEWS ON MICRO SOFT WEBSITE EVERYONE ELSE ON THERE WILL TELL YOU THE SAME THING. IT IS A WASTE OF $50.00. IT IS A DAMM SHAME THAT MICRO SOFT PUTS THINGS OUT ON THE MARKET AND THEY CAN'T EVEN MAKE THEM WORK RIGHT. THEY ARE RIPPING OFF THE PUBLIC. HOPEFULLY WHEN I UNINSTALL VISTA AND GO TO XP ALL!!!! MY PROBLEMS WILL GO AWAY. (STAY AWAY FROM VISTA)
4,speedy delivery,"Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000 pack was new and arrived as product was described. I gave this as a gift, and am not aware of any defects. Delivery was speedy, but I paid for two day service."
5,Great way to communicate,"We love our new webcam! Living far away from our grandchildren, ages 2, 3 and 4, it's a great way to see them and for them to see us. They love talking to us! It's a great way to communicate with anyone but is especially nice for people you don't see very often!"
3,web cam,nice product - have been trying to use for 4 days now. can't get it to work. can't find enough instructions.
4,Microsoft LifeCam VX-3000,"For the price, the quality is good and what I wanted to keep in touch with my family while I'm studying abroad in Europe. I'm using this cam through Skype and integration was seamless. After installing the software, its plug-in and go. The actual video quality is good (not great) but it definately does the job! Would recommend to all, especially because they are so cheap. Enjoy!"
2,Great Movie DVD not worth the wait!,"I love this movie ehough that I few years ago I bought a great used copy of a VHS for $15.And after all this time what to get with a DVD well a copy that looks about as good as the DVD I burned a few years ago that is in ;get this, MONO!I have a Hi-Fi stereo version and this soundtrack sounds worst.Also no extras at all just a nice picture on the DVD back cover of Corinne Alphen that is not on the original VHS and the film trailer.This all has to do with music rights and because there are a few songs by bands such as NRBQ and .38 Special and you can't transfer music rights from one format to another without getting someone to sign off, a crappy mono verison of the DVD is allowed to be released.The one good thing about this DVD is that it is widescreen format and that is the only choice.The same thing for the Hardbodies collection just released also."
2,"Not as strong an effort as 'Up The Creek', but still Cheap Trick got the title song...","and debuted it live on MTV back in '83 before Next PostionPlease, their best album (though not by a wide margin overStanding On The Edge and The Doctor). The single floppedbut remains a collector's 7"" single for the band w/ it'sfans. It also contains a song on the back that doesn'tappear on the Sex, America, Cheap Trick four disk set.Look for it Trick fans!"
3,Don't dis Material,"I haven't heard this album, but I did see New York Gong live and they were excellent. It is ridiculous to insult the musicianship of the musicians who became Material. Material, and leader Bill Laswell, have made dozens of excellent albums for over thirty years. Highlights include the Material albums Memory Serves and Hallucination Engine."
1,Danger Mobile!,"I hated this mobile and ended up throwing it in the trash. First of all, it hangs so low into the crib that it actually touched my baby's face when he laid under it. Second of all, the strings are a choking/strangling hazard, and thirdly and most importantly, the mobile does not attach securely enough to the arm and it was constantly falling off into the crib. It even fell right onto my baby. After that, I threw it away. I have read on the internet that many other parents have had this same experience. This product should be recalled!!"
3,"Okay item, son loves it but it is a battery hog.","When I got this item and hooked it up it was wonderful. I loved the motion, my son at first wasn't at all interested but now at 3 months he is in love with it. The only problem I have had with this mobile is the battery life. Within 2 days of putting in new batteries they are dead. Once the batteries die the mobile is non functional and you must replace the batteries to move the mobile at all. I have had no problems with the arm falling in or breaking as some others have, but then again we have only been using it for a month steady. Overall it is an okay mobile, great concept, but the battery life leaves something to be desired."
3,Nice mobile,"Pros: Creative cute animals, bright colors, good music qualityCons:- The beads have a metal ring on the inside that scrapes and clinks against the plastic rod as the mobile spins around. So when you should just hear music, you hear a LOUD sliding sound over the music.- There are only 2 volume settings for the music. Loud and medium. There is no quiet option which is an issue since the speaker is right next to the baby.It would also be nice if there was a motion only option or a music only option. We also have never used the remote control but I could see how it could be nice to have. Overall, our baby likes the mobile and falls asleep to it and that's all that really matters."
5,Mesmerizing,"This was mesmerizing for my baby, especially when he was younger. It still holds his attention now that he's older but we're going to have to take it out of the crib for safety reasons. It can be somewhat stimulating, so we didn't use it at night, but just for a little playtime before naps, and he usually fell asleep watching it. The music is very good. One reviewer said you can't swing the arm out of the way, but that's not true on ours."
5,This is the bomb!,"My kid loves this thing! He was a fussy baby, and had a lot of awake time, and was bored of his plain mobile by 1 month. This is great to keep him occupied when he is wake and stimulate his senses!!The construction is very sturdy-- just take the time to ready the directions, and its GREAT!"
5,Works like a charm!,"When my baby was younger, he didn't have much use for this and I was afraid I had wasted my money, but as he has gotten older, he loves to listen to this and falls asleep quickly.I love the remote control option and the music does not bother me since it has several selections.This is worth the money!"
5,My Daughter Loves This Mobile!,"We orginially bought the Gossamer Wings moble to match the bedroom, however I promptly returned it after my best friend explaining to me that the baby doesn't really see pastel colors for a while and wouldn't help her streghten her eyes plus we were going to have to rig it on her crib because it didn't fit right. She has the Emily Crib from Millon Dollar Baby. So I purchased this one. I first bought the one with out the remote for $10 less but there was a problem with it. So I exchanged it for this one instead. We haven't used the remote yet, because she doesn't sleep in her crib just yet, but I am sure it will come in handy later. The music is good quality, and the animals can be seen. It also has little shapes on there that move and make noise that get her attention. I reall recommend this moble."
2,DB Cooper,"i cannot wear these headphones for more than an hour without my ears hurting. if you are goin to be wearing these for more time than it takes to walk around the block, then id suggest some over ear headphones like the sennenheiser hd 202s.Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones"
1,2 days old and BROKEN,"These might be nice headphones, can't really tell, THEY ARE BROKEN. there is a little dainty stirrup shaped brittle plastic piece that holds the ""reversible"" earpiece to the headband. This piece is not sturdy enough for adults and I'm sure children would snap this earpiece/earphone off. It is under pressure when the headphones are worn, and this is the weakest link when it should be the sturdiest! I am tired of repairing headphones, I would not advise these headphones to anyone who wanted to use them more than a couple days."
1,Did not fit,This product might be the best. We will never know because it did not fit the DVD player we bought as a packaged deal. We are not sure we can return the headphones because we opened the package.
1,Dont buy these,I bought these manily becasue they were cheap and i at the time have gotten so sick of ear buds. They worked ok for two weeks then all of a sudden there was no sound coming from the right side. Another thing that is a big negative is that they are so dam big and ugly. If you go out in public with these you look like a out of date dork. Sony has gotten down hill lately with these breaking and a portable cd player i had that broke down in a couple of months. I remeber when sony used to make the best electronics. They were the ones that invented the walkman. There walkmans from the 90s and before were so great i still have one that i got 10 years ago.
4,Good Headphones with EQ,"These headphones are an excellent price, and fit comfortably on me, i have a medium sized head,but i can understand how they might feel tight on larger heads. The sound is decent quality, but the bass makes the higher ranges sound muddy, bass reducing EQ setting are highly recommended. Overall a good product for the price."
2,Low sound quality,Even after a month of break-in these headphones sound muddy and distant. I like my Panasonic RP-HT21s much better and they cost $15 less!
3,Good quality but so tight that it gives headache,"I liked the product since it is good quality compared to what you are paying for it. I ignored the reviews about how tight the headphones are, thinking that I am a women and my head size and my ears are small.But hear me guys, the ear-cups are tightly on my ears and they gave headache after using for 10 mins. Especially with glasses or earrings, it hurts a lot."
5,Headphones,This is a great pair of headphones for those taking trips. They block out the sound fairly well and are extremely comfortable. Definate good buy for a reasonable price.
1,No bass,"I can't believe most of the reviews here. These are some of the worst headphones I've ever had. You can't hear the bass, the highs will soon ruin your hearing, the plastic headset is too uncomfortable, the cable is too long. This product is really bad, even for the low price. This brand is overrated."
3,Decent sound for the $ but I don't find them comfortable.,"Your experience may be different, I personally just don't find them that comfortable. However, they make a great set of extra headphones and they're very durable so if you need a pair of ""beaters"" then these will fit the bill."
2,Headphones disappointment,These phones did not deliver as I expected. You need to turn up the volume on devises they are connected to to get any decent audio sound out. I have buyers remorse for buying this product.
2,Spend a little more,"I was really let down by this set of headphones. The sound quality was boomy at the low end and muddy at the higher freqencies. On top of this, this is probably the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever owned. Spend a little more, I think you'll be glad you did."
2,Comfortable but muddy,"Bought these to replace a pair of old Koss headphones that I use mainly for home recording. These things may look similar, and fit well, but that's it; the only reason they're even getting two stars is that if you have enough time, you can probably find a setting on whatever EQ you're using that sounds passable, but for recording they are horrible. Overall, a very muddy sound, seemingly centered on the upper end of the bass frequencies, and little to no treble at all.These really wreak havok with pretty much any genre of music you use them with; perhaps I have an overly sensitive ear as a musician, but I shouldn't have to eq twice (once while using these as a monitor and then once to correct for them during mixdown). You get what you pay for where accurate sound reproduction is concerned."
2,disappointing,"I bought these on the basis of the reviews, the price and the need to cut down on sound in a mildly noisy workspace. I'd say that there is about a 10 percent reduction in noise, even with music playing; much less than I expected. I don't recommend these and should have done more research. And they aren't very comfortable either."
1,Sounded great for the 6 days I had them!,"Decent sounding headphones, especially for $15. Unfortunately a tiny plastic piece broke on the right ""hinge"" when I was putting them on. Flimsy would be an understatement, I had them for under a week. I would recommend something more durable."
3,earphones to use inflight,"they work very well, my only reservation is that they they don't fold to better fit in my carry on bag"
4,"Its good sound, easily broken","Ok, you know what everyones been saying about this... really uncomfortable, and they are right at first. You have to press those cups to break them in and adjust the headphones to your head. After that... it still gets sore, but not as fast (like all headphones like this).My main gripe with this is that these things also don't last very long if you aren't super careful with them... if you make a mistake you can break those small little hinges at the end of the cans. For me I like moving around a lot so these things are ususally thrown in a bag with everything and it gets jumbled. They get busted.Sound quality is good for the price once you get over the fact that there is pain in your ears. The sound quality is the only reason this gets a 4. I personally would get this if I didn't have the money, but I'd rather spend a few extra bucks to get the Senheiser HD 202's instead."
1,Not good for music,"There is no doubt that these Headphones are worthless if you are looking for accurate music reproduction. One reviewer blamed the bad reviews on people not understanding ""the specs"" and full spectrum sound, but the problem is the headphones do not live up to the specs they claim and there is no full spectrum sound coming from these headphones. If you don't mind listening to flat listless music then you may not regret buying this item. They may be OK for listening to news reports or book readings but if you are looking for music to sound they way it was meant to when it was produced you had better look elsewhere."
3,Good sound but...,they feel too tight and hot. My ears burn after wearing them for a while. Maybe the headphones were designed for people with small heads. I tried some Panasonics at a computer lab that felt much more comfortable.
3,quality sound but not for long usage..,"I brought this to use at my work(with PC)..but after listening for 2 to 3 hours I had to takeoff the headphones..!!They do not cover my ears completely instead they apply pressure on my ears and it pains.(removed 2 stars for this..)The sound quality is really good, great looks,the cord is long."
3,Great on the ears but tight on the head,"I bought my set from Wal-Mart. The sound is excellent with deep full bass and clear higher frequencies. Much better sound than the foam ambient noise type. My main concern was that the headphones are TIGHT on the ears. The cups (as noted by other reviewers) do not cup the ears, but rather sit on and press directly against the ears. Great sound or not, after half and hour or so of listening I would actually have a headache from the ear pressure. I gave these away and found a set of headphones at Radio Shack that sounds just as good and has a large enough cup to totally enclose the ears. After 3 or 5 hours these are still comfortable."
2,"Terrible fit, who cares about the sound?","In the end, if a pair of heaphones is uncomforable to wear like the Sony MDR-V150s are to me, the sound doesn't really matter. The only reason I gave two stars is perhaps these do fit some people OK; but I could not wear these for over 15 - 20 minutes without discomfort."
3,GOOD sound for the money.,"First off I've always been fairly satisfied with Sony headphones. These are a good low to middle of the road semi-pro headphone. For $15 the sound is not bad, the highs are slightly muddy, but the bass and mid-range is pretty good. The downside of these is the comfort. They are NOT comfortable at all. They feel like hard plastic with a little bit of foam on the ear pads; and the headband is hard plastic with no foam. I'm a writer/director so I picked these up to wear while i'm on the set to monitor the audio. I don't plan on continuiously wearing them as I'll be taking them off and on throughout the shoot, so personally I don't mind the uncomfortableness. However if you plan on wearing them for any consecutive length of time, i wouldn't recommend them."
4,Great Headphones,"The package arrived on time and in good conditions. The sound is excellent. The only problem is that it does not cover your ears completely, therefore the sound can escape a little bit, but I still recommend the product."
3,Review,Good quality for the price. Only complaint is that the ear cups are a little small for my ears and the band a little tight so wearing them for a long time can create a small pressure discomfort on the sides of the head.
3,Decent headphones,I had these headphones for about 14 months and really enjoyed them. The sound quality is really good for the price youre paying. Nice Bass decent noise cancellation but not high quality the music really drowns out most outside noises if you turn them up. They do press down on your ears a bit but nothing too bad. THE CORD IS VERY LONG this is good if you are using them in a studio but for those who are not it can become very annoying after awhile. This also leads to a short in the cord that stops the sound from coming through clearly out of both sides. Overall 3 stars i think for the price you are getting a nice product good job sony
3,You get what you pay for,"> treble is flat> mid-range merges with the low ends into a very muddy and vague bass> Drivers are fairly small so the low end in itself is pretty much nonexistent.I'd say the one thing these headphones lack is definition. I've been spoiled with high end audio equipment, but these headphones have a tendency to merge all sound ranges into a flat non-descript kind of mess. A shame as they look awesome, have good build quality and feel pretty snug on the head without being too large.At 13.99 from Argos though, they make a great set of backup headphones / kids headphones / headphones to use and not worry too much about :-)"
2,"Great in some respects, mediocre in others","I had problems with one of these units (left ear piece stopped working after a mere 15 minutes of use), but ultimately got a replacement and bought and additional one and both are fine. The ear pads are exceptionally comfortable, but the head piece is poorly designed and digs into your head above your ears. As for audio quality, well, you get what you pay for, but it's not too bad. Not audiophile, but great for use on a computer."
4,Great headphones for the price.,"I bought these headphones for about $20. They are a great deal for the price. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because I wear glasses and the headphones cause discomfort when I wear them. Yet I expected that and it happens with all on ear headphones. I'm returning them for some over the ear headphones in hope that they will not be as uncomfortable. I know this is a personal problem. Overall, great headphones! (If only I had contacts...);)"
4,Great buy for the money,"I'd been looking for headphones that weren't ear buds and that didn't look like Princess Leia's ear buns, and these fit the bill. The price was terrific, too. I used them on a long flight and they were perfect. The fit was great and I could hear everything quite well. Unfortunately, due to the confines of an airline seat, I accidentally snapped off the connector mid-flight and I had to use the airline headphones. I could really tell how good these headphones were then. The difference between crappy airline headphones and these was astounding. I'm going to buy another pair just to make sure I have them available whenever I need them!"
3,Works well but too tight,"These headphones deliver good sound at a great price. Though they're far too tight, even at the widest setting. And I only have an average-sized head. After wearing them for an hour my ears start to get sore. They also can't be folded for easy packing. Ultimately this is best for people who want headphones for home-use and have small heads."
2,Not very good,"I bought these headphones quite a while ago and have been experiencing many problems with them. First I noticed that if I left them on my ears for too long my ears would begin to hurt. They also don't block out outside noise very well, so that if there is music going on from a television in the background it can sometimes interfere with whatever I happen to be listening to. Most annoying of all though is that the plug for the headphones doesn't fit into my computer correctly so that sometimes if thee plug gets jiggled around or so much as even touch it the sound will mess up getting staticy and losing a track, and I have to fiddle around with the plug for a few minutes to get the sound back on track and after a while doing this get's very annoying.Overall I think these are very poor quality headphones, and that is very dissapointing.But I have to admit they do work and if you don't intend on using them for an extended period they'll get the job done, just don't count on quality."
2,Disappointed.,"Comfort wise, this is a zero. Listening with these headphones for more than 15 minutes gives me a headache, and I feel that the sound is too stuffy. Definitely expected more. Decent for the price."
2,Get what you pay for,"I was not expecting these to be great headphones, and they aren't. The sound quality is not that great. There is some scratchiness for certain melodies and notes. For example, Jason Mraz doesn't sound too good. The Black Eyed Peas, however, sound fine. The earcups are not very comfortable, and ear fatigue occurs in less than an hour. That said, the sound quality is better than the tin-like sound that comes out of the laptop speakers. The cups seal decently and this helps minimize exterior noises. The cord plug is plenty long, which is an improvement over my old ipod earbuds. My main impetus for purchasing these was to get an alternative to the earbuds, and they manage that fairly well. If you can find a $20-something model with good reviews, that might be a better purchase. These are what they are. I'm still undecided on whether it was a good purchase or not. Also, I haven't used the larger adaptor plug, so I can't comment on how well that works."
2,plug connection weak and stopped working,"After several months of use, the plug stopped working and had a loose connection, so that only one side would work sometimes.They also don't cancel out room noise very well."
1,Horrible,Headphones are way too small for the shape. They were going for a cheap knock off of dj headphones and failed.
1,"Great sound, poor quality","I've used these headphones almost daily for 5 months. The sound is really good -- especially when you consider the price -- and the headphones are very comfortable.However, do consider my misfortune with build quality when buying these: the plug broke in half (there are two plastic notches on the jack; it split at the first one) and the little metal piece got stuck in the aux port in my computer. I have no idea how to get it out.The headphones now play only in one ear and I cannot plug any other ones in.Needless to say, the warranty period of 90 days is long over."
2,"Decent build, mediocre sound","These headphones are reasonably comfortable, though if you wear eyeglasses you might find them pressing your glasses against the side of your head in an eventually painful way.The sound quality is mediocre. Music seems too dead, lacking vibrance. Even Sony's basic $10 comes-with-the-walkman headphones sound better than these.Overall, these are probably fine for background music whilst working, but if you want to really listen and pay attention to the music, try something else."
3,Good concept but a pain to play,"The game in itself is a good idea, but moving around on it is a different story. I tried to play it (and I do know how to spell) but getting it to move and turn was a pain. It was not one of my best purchases."
4,Antique Iron: Identification and Values,"Unusual type book to locate, books are rarely written about this subject in these times. I looked for several months before I found ""Antique Iron"", and was please Amazon made it available. Cast Iron is building in popularity and this book offers a full range of choices and values available. Published in 1984, it may be off as far as prices, but you still get a good guide as to choices of design.A must have for those collecting Cast Iron."
3,Not the Risk you grew up with,"So to start, you CAN play this like the orignal Risk so it is like the orignal in this way. As far as playing it the new way it was very complicated and me and my 11 year old spent 1hr just looking over the directions. It will be fun once you figure out the directions (which we have not done yet :( )."
1,Caiman Review,Do not order this product or any other from Caiman! They take forever to send your products and should not be trusted
5,the one medicine my son takes without complaining,"I was surprised to see another reviewer say her sons hated the taste of Claritin syrup. I haven't tried Reditabs, but my son won't take any chewable tablets so we only use syrups. Most medicines he fights us over, but Claritin he is happy to take every night. When we miss a night, we can tell because his skins gets all red and puffy around his eyes - so it must be working. (We had also tried Zyrtec, back when Claritin required a prescription, and switched to Claritin due to lower cost.)"
1,bad tasting!,"I got some of this for my children w/ allergies, because the Zyrtec made them so sleepy. My older son could take the Claritin tabs that melt on the tongue, and liked them (though they didn't help much). However my younger son was under 6 so I got the syrup. He hated the taste, but since he's kind of picky (though he will take the Zyrtec w/o complaint) I had the older son (less picky) try it. He also hated it. So we have a nearly full bottle and both children would rather suffer stuffy heads than take any more! I myself have taken adult Claritin with some relief, but nothing has ever come close to Flonase in effectiveness for me or my son! I would say if you have a choice, go for the melting tabs of Claritin."
3,"DVD Has Been Edited A Little, But Still A Good Movie","You would think that the DVD version of this movie would be the ""uncut"" version, but instead it seems like the DVD has been cropped at the top and bottom, no matter what you view it on, so that certain things have been removed from the film- Most notably in the shower scene; In the original cut, you can see more details. Conversely, the DVD version of this scene could probably be played on television without much fuss! What's very puzzling about this is that the clear view of David Duchovny's naked booty is still in the movie, as are other explicit scenes!Anyway, as a movie, this is decent. I'd recommend Christians avoid it, though. It will just tick them off."
2,Bland Film Without a Point Leaves This Viewer Cold,"This movie is like that saying: ""He was a Jack of All Trades, but a Master of None."" This film tries hard not to offend anyone by offering both the believer's position as well as the atheist's position. But in the process, it ends up taking no position at all about the veracity of religious claims, such as God's existence or the possibility of a Rapture. Mimi Rogers was stiff, but good as the sexpot-turned-fundamentalist. While other viewers were moved by the ending, it left me empty. I screamed, ""Is that it?"" Honestly, I didn't find very many clear-headed individuals in the film. Everyone's either walking sex-machines or babbling Bible-thumpers. It's not my kind of entertainment. It might not be yours either, unless you like to mix your religion with your entertainment."
1,ANTI CHRISTIAN PROPAGANDA!!!!,"I think I would be offering a valuable public service if I would announce to all of you that this movie is a bigoted, narrow minded slurr against Christians and the Bible (i.e. the message is that all people of faith are mentaly ill and brainwashed maniacs) This movie mocks God, Christ, and people who profess to have faith in the Bible. It makes all people of faith to be nothing more than silly idiots who are insane and cannot have rational normal thoughts or actions. I saw no redeeming value in the twisted, biased, and comic-book parody of end-time Biblical prophecy. Do not be misled by the title of this film. This movie contains perverted sex scenes, nudity, and violence. If this movie had stereotyped any other group or class of people as it has done Christians it would be banned and the people who made it forced to make an apology. It's TRASH!!!"
1,A R Movie listed as Christian/End Times,"When I received this DVD I had not opened it, but saw on the back 3 people in bed. Then I looked to see the rating. R. I had not looked at the rating because I trusted the placement of it. In my opinion, this DVD should not be listed with Christian or family material. My hopes were dashed because I am an end-times fan."
1,Not a christian film,"If you are looking for a christian film about the rupture, this is not it. The film is about a woman that changes her life but not for Christ but for a Sect that pretends to be christian and they tattoo themselves with a pearl.It has a lot of sex and I was very disappointed when I watch it. I don't understand how people can call this a Christian film. Long, boring and I kept on expecting something to happen. It didn't."
3,Hot !,"This movie is a wake up call to many of us! I cant watch this movie with my kid, it is adult rated, but very true to life."
4,Nice Phone - Color So So,"This phone works very nicely with the TG2700 Series, but the color is not very attractive. It's comfortable and has some nice options like the main hand set. It can store numbers and now that I have AT&T the CallID works everytime; which was not the case with VOIP. Speaker works really well I can hear callers clearly and they hear me good. I did buy a headset for this item, which didn't work so well. Over all it's cheaper than other handsets that work with the base. So I would choose it if you can handle the color."
1,Beware the Battery Life - Panasonic will not support.,"The rechargable battery in this handset WILL develop a memory and become unusable during the warrenty period. Panasonic claims the battery in this handset is an ""Accessory"" and not covered under the warrenty. And, they say ""sorry"" but they can not help. Interestly, they do cover some batteries in other handsets.My suggestion is NOT so buy products from a company where the usage of the product causes a problem they do not cover. If you are willing to replace the battery yourself every 3 - 6 months of use, it is probably a good handset.Personally, I will not buy another Panasonic product."
1,subpar,"Disapponting series. Try something else. The lessons presented here are very basic, and nothing can be learned here. You can find the same materials free on the net with complete pronounciations and examples and text...of course no graphics but its just like this video. Its like watching a powerpoint presentation with still graphics or no graphics at all. Painful to watch."
1,"Cuisinart - must be French for ""junk""","Felt I should add my complaints to those already posted. The unit cycles constantly, a considerable annoyance in all but the noisiest rooms. It claims to use only as much electricity as a 100W light bulb, but the cycle time on this unit could mean $100 per year at $0.10 per KWh. But my major complaint is the default to the lowest setting after a power failure. We have many power interruptions in our area and this thing resets itself to about 45 degrees, which it can't maintain, so it runs continuously until someone notices."
4,Very pleased !,"We've had wireless speakers before but were limited to plug locations. We wanted something with more flexibility for location & the built-in rechargeable battery gives us that. We're glad we bought 2 because they're just what we needed; in fact, we've already recommended them to others."
4,Sony Wireless Speaker,WE love the Sony Wireless Speaker... it is portable and the sound is excellent. One problem... the on/off button is prone to failure and they don't want to repair it they want to sell you a refurbished unit for $94.
2,"too much hiss, dropouts, failed frequently","I don't know if a good wireless speaker even exists. Despite being very pricey originally (almost $300) the quality was really mediocre, poorer than FM stereo. If you are looking for high fidelity, wireless is not going to please you, especially not these. A hiss/hum was always present, even at one foot away. When I went outside with the speaker reception was horrible. With just fifteen feet-line of sight, the speakers (i bought two) constantly would emit pops. At about a year the receiver would die and require the plug be pulled beofre it would work again. Eventually it would die faster until the reciever would work for less than 10 minutes, then went out entirely.A wireless set would still be nice, I miss it, but I don't believe Sony is any better than others. Sony also puts only 90-day warranty on a lot of equipment now. Even THEY don't have any confidence in their manufacturing."
2,Short range..,"While the sound quality of this unit is pretty nice considering its small form factor, I had trouble getting clear reception anywhere outside of the room where my computer is located. I tried switching channels and moving the location of the base unit, but nothing helped. I wouldn't buy this unless you have a direct line of site from the base unit to the speaker."
2,Mediocre at best.,"First the good news: the actual writing isn't bad, in terms of technical competence. The characters were mostly handled well, both in terms of dialogue and interaction; Major Kira was a bit too hostile, but that was fairly standard for this early in the series, and Odo displayed a variety of intelligence that I don't expect to see from him, but otherwise the book was well enough written to make two separate fairly uninteresting plots passably readable.But that's the bad news: the story behind the writing just wasn't interesting; it's a bad sign when the poker tournament at Quark's is more interesting than the obligatory station crisis.This book was actually written as a collaborative effort between Dean Wesley Smith and his wife, Kristine Katheryn Rush. (Sandy Schofield is the pseudonym they chose for the collaboration.) If you are familiar with (and fond of) the individual work of either of these writers, you might want to try this one. But I can't say that I was overly impressed."
3,Nothing happens,"This is a pretty good DS9 novel, and an interesting debut for this psuedonym, but the biggest problem is that it doesn't really go anywhere.The obligatory crisis situation comes in the form of subspace fluctuations which are threatening the power systems and structural integrity of not only DS9, but of everything from Bajor to Cardassian space.The real plot of the book, however, revolves around the big poker game, and all the cheats, countercheats, plots, and attitudes involved therein.While most of the characters are pretty well portrayed, there is too much animosity between Kira and O'brian, and the authors use to many ideas and characters from previous episodes.This is an OK DS9 book, but not one of the good ones."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was disappointed to discover that this Zen approach to recovery is based on the 12-steps. Although I think this book is well-intentioned, the author tries too hard to fit the tenets of Zen into the rigid 12-step format. It's also totally unnecessary. A good book about Zen can teach anyone all he or she needs to know to quit drinking and attain peace of mind."
1,This is a BAD switch,"I bought this so that I could hook up 3 different systems to my TV easily. I was not overly concerned with the way the product looked, so i was willing to overlook its obvious design flaws.When it arrived I hooked it up. when wires are coming out of all 4 sides of this thing you realize just how incredibly unpleasant it looks.The real problem with the product is, however, that there is an unmistakable lag between the video and audio. This is a fault I can not overlook. I was even ok with how bad it looked, but I think I'm going to go back to unplugging my AV cables each time i want to switch systems.I am using this splitter with a Samsung HDTV, and the TV does not have this problem when I am not using the splitter.Spend a little more money and buy a better splitter."
5,"Great Read for Aspiring Writers, Actors & Other Creative People","The book is compelling, especially for its target audience: people aspiring to careers in the creative arts. One message comes through loud and clear from those who have succeeded: be persistent; never give up. I have a few friends who are trying to write the Great American Novel or become the next famous director or screenwriter who I'd like to give this book to. It's also a completely engaging and interesting read for anyone who picks it up. Recommend it highly."
1,Blown Pump Head,"Let say first that the pressure washer was easy to assemble, oil, and begin using. It is small enough to move around easily and has more than enough power.And that leads to my problems with this unit. I used it one weekend with excellent results. The next weekend I had it up and running for an hour when the pump head blew off the unit while I was spraying. I found parts 25 yards away. I have a brother who works in the small engine field and I ask him about it and showed him the pump head. He asked if the unit had a Honda engine and when I said yes, he said there is the problem. Honda engines are not run for initial break in before they are mated with the pump. Once the engine is run a couple of hours, it develops higher RPMs and greater pressure. He has replaced more than a few pump heads, and even replaced more than one on the same pressure washer. He has also called the manufacturer and reported the problem."
1,Waste of $$!!,"Bought these for a Christmas present for my boyfriend - the first time he used them they worked great...second time all you could hear was the conversations coming from our neighbor's cellphone. I have not used them since then - they are collecting dust on my entertainment center and I don't know what to do with them. I live in the Rocky Mountains and don't have a lot of neighbors - and like I said, they worked the first time I used them but sounded awful each time after.Buy at your own risk! I would return them if I could..."
4,Excellent Performance,"The Linksys USB hub has worked without incident with several devices attatched. It is small enough to even pack in my briefcase if needed, nice rubber feet on the bottom to ensure it stays where you want it, even with a little pull.As another user commented, the LEDs are a bit confusing, I don't really pay attention to them, but nonetheless, confusing. Other than this, I found no annoying issues with the product.Installation was a breeze, as with most USB devices, no extra software needed, and the user's guide was very straightforward.Overall, I rate the Linksys USB hub 4 stars, because of it's simplicity and excellent performance, along with it's confusing LEDs."
3,Does not always work,"It always worked great on my Thinkpad, but now I found it does not work on my new desktop with WinXP...."
5,I LOVE IT,BUILT TO SPILL RULES. REVOLVING GUITAR RIFFS THAT CAN PUT YOU IN A TRANCE. I SAW THEM A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE LAST SONG THEY DID WAS JUST TRANCE MUSIC. I LOOKED AROUND THE BAR AND HALF THE PEOPLE WERE HEAD BOBBIN AND FALLIN ASLEEP. IT WAS INCREDIBLE.
3,Would be better if not done as Cerebus,The best part of this book is a rather incredible sequence in which Dave Sim analyzes Ernest Hemingway. Remarkably researched this would have made a really interesting graphic novel except that since he was shooting for 300 issues of Cerebus and thus laid it into the Cerebus storyline- thus you have this very realsitic( albeit non-traditional) analysis of Hemingway waeakened by the fact you have an aardvark character in it. This is a good example of how Sims desire to do 300 issues really in many ways shortchanges the artistic and intelelctual potential of the stories he wants to tell
3,Silent movies,I've been collecting silent movies for 2 years now. I was alittle disappointed though with The Treasury of Early Cinema dvd set. The main reason I bought this was to enjoy a favorite movie of mine called A trip to the moon. I don't appreaciate it being narriated at all it sounds bad. I had to put it on mute and play some of my own classical music to go with the movie. I wish Kino Video would make an option on the dvd sets to either have it narriated or not that would be nice!
2,save your money,"Sony is definitely trendy and known for its quality products and this is a quality product but only for a short time. After a while you are going to run into problems. Whether that be the sound cutting in and out or the earmuffs deteroirating. If you don't mind spending 20 dollars on headphones every six months I guess you should go with this product if you are like me who is looking for a headphone set that you can use today, a year from now, and can use it not just for portable devices (i.e. your computer) - then pass on these."
4,Good Headphones,The MDR-G52LP are good headphones. The sound quality is great and it doesn't mess your hair up. The only small problem with it is it begins to hurt a bit if you have it on for a long time. I just take it off for like 5 minutes and it feels fine again.
2,A pain in the ear,"I purchased these headphones because I needed a cheap, silent alternative to my computer speakers. These headphones looked like they had quality and they did sound alright. My problem with these headphones is that after a few hours of gaming while wearing these, my ears would become extremely sore, almost as if I had hung a huge weight on my ears. It kind of felt like someone was trying to tear my ears off after two hours or so. When headphones become this uncomfortable, they become very noticeable. When they get this noticeable, they are more of a pain than a joy to use, literaly. The price for looking cool with these ""street style"" headphones is not only whatever you pay for them, but also excrutiating pain comming from the tops of your ears."
2,"sound is not really all that great, and THEY HURT","I have these and I dont wear them much. They sound like the headphones that come with cd players, and thats not good. Also these hurt after wearing them for awhile, and they REALLY HURT WHEN YOU WEAR GLASSES, and I wear glasses. The only good thing is they look cool. Dont buy these, buy somethng that goes in your ear."
2,sound good but crap,"I have to buy a new pair every 6 months. I like these headphones for the fact that there cheap and sound decent. Its true these do cause your ears to hurt if you wear them to long, and if you fall alseep with them on, forget it. The one time I did it, I had pain in my ears the whole next day. And as I said befor I have to buy these often from poor design, this time I am going to spend the extra money and get a good pair that will last a couple years instead of spending the same amount of money replacing these."
2,Different from the pictured bear,"I was looking to purchase a ""backup"" bear for the Melodies Gund Bear that my son is currently using. I tried first at my local stores, but they all have the newer version of the bear. Different texture ""fur"", different color eyes, no bow but instead has a ""tattooed"" paw and not as stuffed. I purchased this one from Amazon because the bear pictured is the same bear that my son owns. Fingers crossed, I placed my order and waited for the bear to show up. It arrived on time so no complaints - I was quite happy...until I opened the box. What?! It was the newer version of the Gund Bear. The bear in itself is great. The melodies are sweet and the 3 levels of volume are fantastic. The duration (approx. 15 mins) is more than enough to soothe your child. The bear is a great purchase if, IF, this is your first melodies bear but not if you are looking to replace your child's current gund bear (older version pictured)."
5,An Eyecatcher,Makes my Harley-Davidson Edition Ford stand out even more than it already did. It also makes a great snowcatcher if the truck happens to be out in the snow. :)
2,CHEAP CAGE,"I ordered this cage from the product write up, and this is a very cheap cage. The construction is poor and the coating is more like paint then the stone coating advertisised. I would not buy their product again. I own many cages and this is by far the ceapest I ever bought."
5,The Best Check Point Book,"If you must install or work with Check Point FW-1 NG, this book is a must have. I am a consultant working with a customer who was upgrading from 4.1 to NG. We had numerous small issues, many of which were not effectively addressed by CP support. The new Firewall was up and running flawlessly within a day of buying this book. Dameon (""Phoneboy"") is the ultimate expert on all things Check Point, and he is an excellent communicator who has written a very easy to read book. This book will also stay close at hand as a reference anytime a FW-1 question comes up. I have to buy another copy, since the customer above refused to give it back after seeing how useful it was."
3,Nice Visual Guide,"This kitchen ""Field Guide"" is fun to use in educating about most primarily available herbs and spices and many others that may be harder to find or forage for.There are fun facts about the various historical uses of it's subjects and the full color photos are wonderful.It's not really a field guide per se...not for finding and identifying plants in the wild, but it is great for navigating the subtle variations in herb/spice varieties and their specific culinary uses.The book is well organized, small enough to cart around with you through the market or garden, and seems to be well researched.Happy cooking!M."
5,Brilliant Australian Album!,"An absolutely wonderful best of compilation of Australia's finest. From start to finish, each song is a highlight. Songs with a story to tell, that move you inside and out. Classic Australian anthems. Check it out!!!"
2,bonita musica pero muy ligera,"Fue un grupo que gozo de buena popularidad a pesar de que sus interpretaciones no eran nada del otro mundo ,arreglos muy ligeros y planos,pero bueno hay que destacar que adornaron una epoca de oro del pop espanoly contribuyeron a que esta musica fuera mas bella.regardsjose"
2,Have Your Magnifier Ready For This One,The typeset used for this book would discourage even the most ardent of readers from picking it up; not a comfortable read. Typeset far too small. It would help if customers were aware of this before purchase. Not recommended.
3,Reasonably Good but Not Perfect,"If you just want a small copy of the Apocrypha to read once and stick on the shelf this edition will do. However, it isn't good as a reference text or an heirloom of any kind. The cover is cardboard with a standard binding and no jacket. The print is adequate and readable but I wouldn't want to spend hours upon hours studying with this edition. There is no ribbon marker to save your page. If you just want a copy to read once you can get a PDF on the web for free. If you want a high quality reference edition or family heirloom quality book you'll be well served to look elsewhere. The book is exactly as described but less than I was hoping for."
4,Werner Stepladder,"Very sturdy and useful ladder. A bit heavy, but still within the limits a woman can move and use alone."
5,Worth the money,"Definetly worth the extra cash to get the higher load capacity. You can buy the less capacity for less $$, But I had one of those. Really shaky on the upper 3 rungs.8' was a stretch & 12' was too much. This ladder is a rock. very sturdy. The top alum plate seems to work well to provide a extra hand on top."
1,A piece of junk book,"An ideologist, piece of junk book, based on false science, and garbage ideology. I want my money back!"
2,Long life but not anough light,"This camcorder light fit onto my cam well. No batteries are needed has a plug in for charging and charge on this lasted me about 2hrs. I filmed in a dim club and light wasn't bright enough unless your really up on them. good for face to face filming, wouldn't recommend no long distance filming with this."
2,Poor light,"I decided to buy this product based on the reviews that stated the light as bright enough, but in fact the light produced is weaker than the built in light of my JVC GR-D33US which has only 2 LED's. The only pro's is that the light focus is much wider than the camera lights and the battery lasts for a long time, Consider it OK just for object distance below 6 feet."
1,an amazing couple made dull through writing,"This book reads like a series of junior high ""who is your hero"" essays. Karen and David are an incredible duo and a force in the equestrian world, but their story would have been better told by a biographer. The writing is peppered with ""i was like:"" and unexplained comments tossed out about the O'Connor family, and generally runs in a: this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened etc. The authors come off as simultaniously humble and holier-than-thou. All in all, this book is very awkward to read and makes it difficult to care for the couple with their constant talk about how it is their duty to associate with us mere mortals who look up to them. As if, in their attempts to be more accessible, they only place themselves further away. For a much more engaging read, i recommend ""In Service to the Horse"", of which the O'Connors are major players in the cast, and far more interesting than in this attempt."
4,women at war,"From the wives and mothers tending their children while waiting for their men to return home to the resistence fighters and spies struggling to overthrow the axis. From the Red Cross girls and nurses who tended the sick to the Aufseherins of the Concentration Camps who helped select inmates for the gas chamber the role of women during the second world war stretched beyond the tradtional, for better or worse.This book mostly covers the women on the allied side with great detail though some relevence to the lot of women in Germany and Japan and other axis nations while some hints at their darker aspects on their side which are briefly included.Definately a must read for those who are interested in World war two."
4,Experience Speaks,"Reading Sol Stein's ""How To Grow A Novel"" after a long day at the keyboardis like sitting down with a reknown novelist/teacher who also happens to be your best friend and mentor and lives next door.Honestly, I readStein On Writing: A Master Editor of Some of the Most Successful Writers of Our Century Shares His Craft Techniques and Strategiessome years ago and have kept that book close. It is one of my favorite references.Back to HTGAN, no metaphysics here, Stein is straight talking his advice is as clear as it is valuable. This book won't write a novel for you but it will help you to stay with it and to avoid some the serious pitfalls the inexperienced novelist is likely to incur. By the way, my humble opinion, 'growing' is exactly the correct word to best describe how a novel evolves. This is worth a hard read."
2,slow and boring. refund please,"The dreariness of this movie made us want to take some pills and turn on the gas. We can't believe we watched it to the end! This was, yes I said was, our date night movie, a real mood enhancer, pass the bottle of pills!"
1,"Dull, dull, whisper, dull, dull, shout, dull, dull, oh God, so very dull","This flick got some good reviews and I kept thinking, why? Oh, God, why? The screenplay didn't work for me. The sets seem like a backlot. The acting was superficial. I didn't believe for one minute that these characters were from the post war period. Right now they are shouting at each other in a museum - not one other person is there, no one shushes, nothing simmers, they just start shouting like a episode of slutty bitches. The cinematography is just plain bad on my television.After an hour, I couldn't give a damn about any of them. It had an interesting violin concerto and I thought, gee, go listen to that.Ahhh, beware the opinions of A.O. Scott. Who is now on my, What Were You Thinking! list."
3,Different. But mostly good.,"I usually love Rachel Weisz but it was a little hard to get into her character in this movie - she seemed pathetic and lacking in good judgement. But having not ever seen the play, she's could have been just fine. Who knows. The actor that portrayed her husband, the older judge, did a lovely job. You could feel his desperation trying to get her back. And Freddie Page, bad Freddie Page. Tom Hiddelston did a great job of being a troubled, wounded jackass. But out of the two, he seemed much more realistic than Hester. He conveyed more of his character in less screen time and was able to do it and make people like him.I'd watch it again for Freddie Page and that's about it."
3,"It's okay, nothing new, not that spectacular","Rachel Weisz is lovely and does a good job in her role as a cheating wife in 1950 London, but the story is nothing new, rather predictable, and pointless."
5,Oral B Professional Care 7400 toothbrush,"Have had many of these over the years and great dental check-ups to go with it.....By far, this unit is the best one I've had to date. It's faster (oscillating) and you'll appreciate the 30 second signal so your devoting equal time in each quadrant of your mouth.Would buy another one in a second!!!"
4,Great!,This show finally brings something new to T.V. with a fresh new story and original songs. I can't wait to see what's next!
4,best marilyn staging but music itself still iffy; story still good,"There is a terrifically staged musical sequence in here worthy of the late Bob Fosse. The rest of the numbers which have been staged in this show have been very old school. This number is an updated version of Marilyn which shows her singing on a bed surrounded by faceless men in black. Although they first hassle her incessantly, ultimately they turn the bed into a prison cell with carefully concealed bars. This is the best thing that has been done theatrically with this Marilyn Monroe the musical concept. Neither of the Marilyns particularly ignites me though as neither really reminds me of Marilyn.The rest of the storyline advances and personally I would like to see a lot more emphasis given to the Angelica Huston role and the obnoxious director's role. I think the strongest possibilities are with those two characters. The lovelorn problems of lyricist Debra Messing I could entirely do without and I wish her role would be dropped."
5,Suunto MC-2G compass,Outstanding instrument. Fluid and smooth movement of needle with easy declination adjustment. This is truly a great compass for serious and just plain hiking.
5,"Excellent compass, less excellent price:","I'm not exactly an avid adventurer, and I suspect a much cheaper compass would probably get the job done. But, if you really want a sighting compass, this particular one works extremely well.Pros:1. Very easy to set the declination.2. All of the markings you need are easy to read.3. The sights are very accurate, when using the appropriate care and expertise.4. The needle glides easily into position and remains relatively steady.Cons:1. Really, just the price.Honestly, this is a lovely, extremely functional, high quality, well designed tool and you won't be disappointed. I contacted customer support once online, they emailed me back with the solution in two days."
4,I have many compasses and like this on the most,I have many compasses and like this on the most.I am glad that I bought it. It arrived quickly.
5,Compost Bucket,"I've looked high and low for a compost bucket that's not flashy - don't like shiny chrome ones - and not heavy like the crockery ones. This one seems to be the best one out there. I purchased it to replace the older model of the same design. We'd had the old one for about seven years, and after the puppy had chewed it and the charcoal filter thing kept falling out, I decided to buy a new one once the handle finally fell off. We actually use it for scraps for our chickens, not for compost, so the kids would often take it outside to the chicken pen. Suffice to say it had a hard life, and stuck in there well. My only request would be for more color options. The green is okay, and certainly more appealing than the old white one we had, but a choice of colors would be fantastic.The compost bucket arrived from the seller within a week."
2,Flimsy,"The plastic hinge broke the first day I got this. I tried super gluing it, and it lasted a couple of days more. Now the lid hangs from one hinge. This is very lightweight, brittle plastic. The form works fine, but it is not made well. NOT worth $20."
3,It is what it is,"While it is a bit pricey for a bucket, the size and design are perfect, and the filters do work, of course, they are pricey too. I just feel like I could have found or made something similar at the hardware store. Aside from all that, the product itself is terrific and works great."
1,DO NOT BOTHER TO BUY IT,"This looks great on the cover, but all the person does is read a typewritten vocabulary and grammar review. There are NO photos, NO video - only written material that is read. It is SO boring that I almost fell asleep within 4 or 5 minutes of beginning it. I have been teaching for more than 20 years and I guarantee a student who uses this DVD will never study Spanish again! I would have given it a 0 star, but that was not an option."
5,Won't be my last book by Rebecca Forster,"I got this one because it was free. But when I started reading it, it sweep me away. I couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down to do something around the yard.Just a moment ago I bought the other 2 Witness Series books, and am looking forward to reading them.Bobby"
2,"Thin on Plot, Wayyyyy Too Much Souling Searching","I found this book to be tedious and slow. The legal portions were elementary and obvious and nothing much really happens. The ""twist"" or ""reveal"" at the end was telegraphed from the next state. The final dramatic culimating scene near the end was tedious and comical. Half the book is about the emotional state of the lawyer, the protagonist or the victims. I didn't care!!Gave it one extra star because it was free. But this one (seriously!) made me question my due diligence method of downloading free books. I guess that's something."
3,"Its ""OK"" BUT",I love this genre but this book while the plot was interesting failed to deliver realism and ... there seemed some dodgy aspects and missing plot gaps that simpley could not lead to the started point of the book. Still... I just had to finish it!
3,Standard legal thriller,This was okay. If you like legal thrillers then you will probably quite like this.I felt that it was little bit predictable and had too many stock characters and the writing was quite clichéd.It was fairly slow moving.It did pick up quite a lot towards the end and overall it wasn't too bad. It was readable and I did keep on going to the end.
4,Pretty good overall,Pretty good legal thriller. Only thing I didn't really like was how much time the author spent on insignificant details and less time on making the book more action filled/thrilling.
2,Was hoping for better,Not enough excitement while leading up to the story. Taking way too long to get to the heart of the story. Writing is fair
4,likedit,Well written. Kept me turning pages until the very end. Characters were very complex - good story lines - lots of twists and turns.
3,Three stars is generous.,"Good premise, but the story and the main character's behavior were at times ridiculous and not believable. The Kindle version had typos and grammar errors."
2,"slow, shallow characters","First, this book was free. For a free book it was okay. I liked the Josie Bates character but had a problem with the writer's not drilling down to give me a better development. The pace to me was too slow. I overlooked the editing problems but couldn't overlook the basics of scene to scene consistency. There were a lot of instances where scenes were lacking emotion and scenes overplayed. There were scenes that didn't need to be there at all and left me wondering why the writer bothered. But it was a free book and not a bad read just had problems for me that were unnecessary."
5,Hostile Witness,Hostile Witness:This was a very good read. I couldn't put the book down. Couldn't wait to see what happened next.
3,"Hostile Witness. Suspense, Thriller, Implausible character, as a trial victim.","A legal thriller, initially grabs attention. but becomes a bit drawn out with legal terminology, and circumlocution. Eventually gets back on track and leads to an exciting finish, which probably makes one curious to know more about the legal heroine, in subsequent series."
4,Really held my interest,Did not want to put the book down until i finished. now ill have to read the rest of them!
3,So-so,"Had some good parts to it but Josie is very whiney and ""poor me"". Very predictable book with a few, I stress few, suspenseful moments."
5,Hostile Witness,This is my first book for this author. I really enjoyed its pace and plot. It kept me going back. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller!!
3,Hosttile Witness,I really enjoyed this book. I found myself involved in the story. I definitely going to read more books by this author.
3,Good start but goes off the deep end,"I really enjoyed the early chapters of the book and thought the character development and background was well done. But when it got to the actual trial, it got pretty unbelievable. The main character would come up with accusations that would never hold up to an objection, yet she rattled on for several questions before the evil DA would object. I also could never figure out how she came up with a lot of the info she seemed to know about these characters. For free, I thought it was okay and will try reading another of these books later in the series to see if the author improved with experience and hopefully some constructive criticism. It really did have a lot of enjoyable parts."
1,Disappointing,"Pervasive profanity from very start. What a shame. I won't read anymore of this text. Garbage in, garbage out. too bad."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I got this book for free and it was in the top 100 of its category on the day I got it. I was a little bit torn because it had a few 1 star ratings mentioning excessive profanity and bad grammar, as well as poorly drawn characters. Well, I am glad I gave it a chance. There was no profanity, I only found one typo. The plot and characters are well drawn. I enjoyed the book and plan on reading more from this author."
4,Good read,Book was a good read. Kept your attention and guessing who really did it. I would recommend this boof to a friend.
4,Hostile Witness,"Great story, it kept me turning the pages till the end. The characters were strong and interesting. I look forward to reading more by this author and in this series."
1,Poor writing/editing spoiled a promising plot,"Luckily I downloaded this novel free so at least I don't feel I've been ripped off. I think the author had a great premise and the plot showed some real promise; but the thinly developed characters, disjointed construction, typos, grammatical errors, and hackneyed phrases finally got to me. I ceased hoping the book would improve and gave up at the 26% mark.I read some of the other 1 star reviews and agree with most of them, except for those which found the novel flawed simply due to course language. I couldn't care a whit about four letter words liberally used in a well-constructed book. This assemblage of words doesn't appear to have even been proof-read before it was sent off for publishing."
5,Best Free Book I Ever Read,"What a great legal thriller! This is the first book in a series, and I just downloaded the next two books for 2.99 each. Can't wait to read them."
4,Red Eye thriller,"Enjoyed the book very much. Stayed up until 3:30 am couldn't put it down.(red-eye)However, I knew who did it way before the author did (LOL). Not best book I ever read but so far it's the best free book from amazon I've read. Thanks Amazon."
4,Hostile Witness,"Brilliant book. Couldn't put it down, trying to work out who did actually set the fire that killed Hanah's grandfather and why her mother is accusing her.HOSTILE WITNESS (legal thriller, thriller) (The Witness Series,#1)"
1,did not like,"Don't waste cash on this one, if it appears on free list go for it. Otherwise don't you can read trash for free anywhere"
5,Great read,I am a huge Stephen king fan and I decided to read this book and I have to read the rest of her books now
4,Hostile Witness,I chose this rating because I thought it was a good book.I liked the story it kelp you interested all the way through the book.I will refer to friends.
3,average,"A good insight into legal maneuverings, and likeable protagonist. However, I thought there was often unnecessary repetition of material, insufficient character development, an unbelievable disbelief regarding the condition of a secondary character, and overall a predictable plot. Also, Ms. Forster needs a better editor. I thought it might just be the translation to Kindle format with the multiple punctuation errors, until I read a reference to ""track house."" Good grief."
4,Hostile Witness,"I really enjoyed this thriller, it kept my interest all the way to the end. It keeps you wondering throughout, I like the she writes!"
4,hostile witness,enjoyed the plot although I found it easy to identifythe guilty person even so it wasvery interesting and I thoroughly enjoyed it
3,"It was just all right for me, dawg","I began reading Hostile Witness several months ago and just managed to get through it this week. In fact, I read seven or eight other books while struggling to finish Hostile Witness. That's how slowing-moving it was. The courtroom scenes, for the most part, were not realistic. No judge would allow the questioning tactics employed by the lead character, Josie. If you love a good, fast-paced legal thriller, don't buy this book."
4,Very interesting,"Hard for me to put down this one. it kept me at the edge of my seat, playing the investigative roll trying to figure out who the real mastermind was. lots of good twists and turns. not bad at all for a free book :D"
4,Hostile Witness,"A good read, moves fast. Has a good plot and some good twists to it. Look forward to reading the series."
4,Hostile Witness,"Started out slow. Thought there was too many details in each chapter instead of getting to the point! Once they were in the courtroom, it got exciting. I knew who did it. It seemed like it took forever for her to figure it out. Guess I will try another one of her stories!"
4,Engaging,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. More than I expected. The writing is quite well done and also fairly timeless (this is several years old - which is often true of low-priced kindle releases and too often they don't wear their age well when references are made to technology things). I like it and will read more. Here are the books in this series, in order (I **hate** spending time to figure out the next book to read - yes I'm one who likes to keep things in order, I guess!): Silent Witness; Privileged Witness; Expert Witness."
4,Excellent,"Rebecca Forster is an amazing storyteller. Hostile Witness has it all, characters you'll love and bad guys you'll love to hate. A real page turner."
3,Good book,"It was okay but it could of been better, and I really liked the last two chapters in the book!It was probably 3 and half star rating."
4,"enjoyable,good read",Couldn't stop turning the pages ... thought it was a really good book but the ending was a little predictable.
4,A good book,This book by Rebecca Forster was good enough that I would read another book by this author. I liked her lead character.
4,Kept me reading!,"This is one of those books that when you need to go to sleep, you keep on reading until you're nearly blind. I really enjoyed the plot twists even though there were small periods of too much description. I love a book when you end the chapter and you just have to look at the next just to see what happens."
4,HOSTILE WITNESS,Good legal thriller without spending alot of time on the courtroom procedures. I could not wait to see what as on the next page so I ended up reading until 3am. One of those books that you cannot put down. Very glad I started wtih the series #1. Now ready for the next one!
4,good read,"Very good read, kept me wanting more, I was kind of sad it ended. I would like to read more from this writer."
3,OK read,Not the best thriller I've read but it's a good read. Doubt I will read the other books in the series.
4,hostile witness,Great book a thriller that definitely is a page turner if your looking for a book u can't put down this is the book for you to read I have really enjoyed this book
5,great reading,Great reading couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next novel. Love my new kindle best investment ever.....much lighter than carrying books .
5,Easy Read & Great Storyline.,I truly enjoyed this book. The author did an excellent job of making the characters personable. It is truly one of the few gems I've found among the free books and am looking forward to reading more of the author's works.
1,Middle School Success,"Don't bother buying - especially for Math. Pre-Algebra, Algebra I & II and Geometry are non-existent on the CD's except as a page (no links) on the engineering cd. The rest of the cd is fun for about 10 minutes with very little learning value. Typing Tutor is okay, but boring.Tried Tech Support as listed on CD and the site could not be found. No instructions within box, had to install each cd to determine scope of lessons that were contained."
3,Didn't learn too much,"Didn't really learn anything new with this one, and the graphics are very poor quality. I did learn a heck-of-a-lot from several chapters of ""The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black. Like how to keep your husband/boyfriend from seeing call girls. Wow!"
1,Service,"I ordered this book on the 19th of May and finally on the 18th of June I got a refund as my book never arrived. I was in contact with the seller, however, she keep saying I don't know what happened I mailed the book."
2,Not an easy reader,"After purchasing this book and reading it I found that it was not an ""easy read."" It had a lot of medical jargon and was very ""over the top.""!!!!!! Needless to say, I would not suggest purchasing this book;however some of the things were somewhat helpful."
2,"Fair sound, poor durability with eroding wires. -- Grade - D","When I first saw them, I loved the layout of the wires. Fitted to one side with a longer right earphone wire. They worked great as far as body fit. The sound seemed fine, but too much sweat will plug them up in my ears. In the last month, I've noticed that the wires are disintegrating. Perhaps it's interaction with sweat, since the affected area would tend to get more. I don't know for sure, but I would pass on these for this very reason. Granted, they were only ~$30, but headphones should last for years. Not months. They should meet their fate because you've crushed, yanked, or pulled on them, and not from defective materials. Grade - D"
1,love the phones not the cord,"Beware - this vendor does NOT include the original Sony extension cord. His has the much smaller male plug, (guess that's the 2.5mm label, as if I knew what that meant) along with a control that does nothing."
3,good but could be better,"The good: nice sound, good noise isolation, fit well, decent price.The bad: after just a few months of regular use the cord started to wear out and after about 4 months the rubber was peeling off completely exposing the wires - I'd never seen such poorly made cords."
4,"Great earphones, while they lasted","I had these earphones for about one year when one side just stopped working. Nothing noticeable occurred, like a pinched or cut wire, it just went dead. They were always handled with care, never any rough treatment. Good phones, but should have lasted longer."
4,Good value,"Took them for a test drive with some Townes VanZandt this AM and was very satisfied in every respect regarding performance. I have one concern, they are very fragile, almost dainty which on one hand is an attribute but they will require careful handling and should always find their way back into the cloth carrying bag after use."
2,Unimpressed,"I bought a pair of these headphones based on a review I read in a magazine. It said something about being the most bang for the buck.Although I prefer the earpiece wires to be symmetrical in length, the different lengths were not a big deal for me.They look great, and the fit of the headphones themselves is very good (comfortable and will not easily fall out).The issue I have with these is the sound quality. For headphones which sit directly in the ear canal, they sound a little too muffled for my taste. I was expecting a much cleaner/crisper sound from them.Although they are not terrible, I find them to be lacking in the fidelity department.Would I buy them again? The answer is no, which is why I only gave the item 2 stars."
2,"Great phones, crappy hardware","Over the past 3 years I have purchased these headphones 3 times. I absolutely love the sound and comfort but if you just throw your headphones in your bag or purse when not in use the wires will wear down and knot and ultimately cause one of the earbuds to stop working, happens without fail. Sure it comes with a nice little sack to hold the headphones but I use the things because I'm on the go, neatly folding the headphones when I'm getting on and off a plane or going in and out of a store just won't happen. This time I am going after another pair because I will not cough up another 35 bucks for flimsy workmanship. I never had this problem with the freebies that came with diskmans and mp3 players."
2,NO bass,"I bought these headphones because I thought they were high quality and lightweight. I ended up having to use my cell phone wire clip to clip the wires to my shirt or else the left bud would pull on your ear. These is no bass in these headphones. Most of the reviews state good bass, but it feels like the treble is on 8 and the bass is on 2. Very disappointed."
4,Valued Upgrade,"First and foremost, I must say that these sony's did not blow me away at first. Just as a quality home set of speakers need to be broken in to reach their fullest potential, so does the fontopia headphones. Once broken in, the sound is full and rich - rivaling my Sennheiser HD 280 pro's.I would recommend that if you were to purchase these, first give them constant play using all sorts of music for a couple of days. I didn't even use mine until I broke them in on my Zen Micro playing all genre's of music etc. Jazz, Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, and downtempo electronica.Once these are properly broken in, it's hard to beat the sony's price vs. performance value. Sure they're not true audiophile headphones, but they come awfully close."
2,Not for commuting,"Used at home and I thought the sound was fine..this was before I pushed them in and had to commute. First the cable design is awful. Without the extension the cable can't even reach a coat pocket. With the extension you have at least an extra foot hanging around. But, the biggest grip from me was the weight. The cable uses a large metal oval to split the right and left earphone. This, plus the weight added by the extension, pulls the left headphone out all the time. Even if there is a fix I could try by wrapping the cord, it's really not worth it."
4,cord connection adds weight to one side,"I own both a MDREX71 and 51, soundwise they are both great, but the thing I don't like about the 71 is the connection to the cords, it adds weight to one side of the earbud. It's great for those with a volume control thingy, but if you want just a earphone to the sound device, i recommend the 51 over the 71 model."
3,"Sound and price Good, cord BAD!","What others have said about the good sound quality of these earphones is true, and they are also very comfortable, much more so than the Ipod phones that I retired when I got these. This is my second set which I got on recommendations of some of the reviewers. The first set was white, and the insulation on the wires of those started dissolving and falling off after only six weeks. Some reviewers said the wire on the black ones was better so I tried those. I sit here another six weeks later with headphones that are disintegrating, the insulation has turned to a soft putty-like consistency and is just falling off the wiring in hunks. Perhaps users that wear the product outside of clothing where perspiration is less of an issue would be more satisfied with this product, unfortunately job safety prevents me from wearing the Ipod and it's wiring exposed."
2,Not Good Sound with an Ipod Mini,"When used with my IPod Mini with the equalizer set to Rock, or any other setting, the sound is very tinny with very little base. OK for listening to the spoken word as in Old Time Radio shows."
2,Disappointed in Houston,"I bought these earbuds to replace the iPod stock buds from Apple. Several people reviewed that these sounded superior than the standard iPod buds. The sound from the Sony MDREX71SL was very tinny. The base was extremely poor. I don't know if someone from Sony signed on and tried to pump these up or what, or perhaps someone was comparing them to other $35 earbuds, but compared to the Apple iPod standard buds, these are as poor as those that come with the Audible device sold for listening to voice. These are extremely poor for listening to music with deep base requirements. Save your money if you have the buds that come with the iPod, or perhaps check out a more expensive set of phones/earbuds.Brad in Houston"
2,flimsy cord?,"I bought these in March and they have worked well until last week, when one earbud stopped emitting most of the sound. I suspect it is the flimsy cord, although I do not recall any sudden jerks and I certainly haven't abused them. I agree that the cord is too short and the extension too long and they would have done better to make a longer cord without extension. I bought previously a pair of Sony's noise cancelling earbud phones (very expensive) which have worked fine, but I wanted something a little less cumbersome for everyday use. The difference in the gauge of the cord is phenomenal, as the noise cancelling phones have a much thicker cord. Sony would do well to put the same gauge cord on these phones, but I guess they are trying for repeat business when these break down and attempting to save cost on manufacture. Not for me, too expensive to buy these every 5 months."
4,The 4th time is a charm!,"I gone thru several brands, and a lot of cash, trying to find that combination of function and form. These earbuds come with 3 sizes of 'ear plugs', and the small ones actually fit. What a relief! I took a while, but I finally found a pair of earbuds that fit AND sound great! I have been listening to my MP3 player everywhere from work to the beaches of Cancun, and have been extremely happy with the sound quality and comfort. You won't be disapppointed if you buy these."
1,Fatal Flaw...,"Let's be clear- these are incredibly comfortable headphones that sound great.Problem is they fall apart after about two weeks of use.The first time I thought it was a fluke, and I bought another pair, then another. On all three the insulation turned to jelly after a couple weeks and exposed the bare wires... I've returned them all because they're still under warranty, but Sony needs to scrap the existing stock and get these manufactured with proper wire insulation."
2,Very disappointing,"Based upon the mostly positive reviews, bought these. Not very good. The silicone (or whatever) earbuds are very comfortable, but that's about all there is that's positive to say.Very tinny and anemic. No range at all. Ultimately, they sound lousy.I bought these as a replacement for the phones that cames with my Iriver HP-120 Mp3 Jukebox, but these earphones are very clearly inferior."
2,Sony Ear Bud Review,"I bought these earbuds in the last 2 months and one of the earbuds has already gone out. They are very cheaply made, I would not recommend buying unless you just need a fix for a few days until you can buy a reliable pair of earphones."
5,The right match,"I am not sure where all of the complaints are coming from on the sony ear buds...but for a runner, they are right on! Good seal, great clarity, and a reasonable price. The complaints about the short cord and the longer length ear cord are not too well thought out. It is exactly what I need to keep the cords from bouncing and putting too much stress on the ear buds. Count me well satified!"
3,ID-10-T wire design,"FASHION ASPECT:OK, I understand now, that the design of the wire is supposed to help them hang like a neckace when not being used. HOWEVER, why would I wear them as a necklace when I bought them to keep specific sound in, and noise out? EXTREMELY STUPID DESIGN as far as the wire is concerned. The engineer behind this spends too much time watching teen fashion to keep their current position. If SONY sends me a replacement set built like a normal set of earphones/buds, I'll retract this statement.SOUND PRODUCTION ASPECT:EARPLUGS? You can't beat the clarity, volume, bass response, etc. I can now easily hear the stereo input @ Interstate speeds on my motorcycle. Great engineering for the sound production part of these."
3,"Sounds Good, Breaks Easily","These head phones are weak. I have already had 2 of them stop working within a few months. Also, its ridiculous that the head phone cord length is smaller than the cord for the right ear (doesn't make any sense). It's a waste because you have to use the extra cord all the time."
2,Fragile!,"I liked these headphones a lot. But after just a few months, the right ear stopped working. And don't even try to get support from Sony. They send out irrelevant form letters in response to your query."
2,Remote is needed!,This headphones are really great! Problem is with the extension court... It doesnt work without the remote control... (I tried to replace them) If you can use just the short cable (without extension) it will be fine...They are constructed for the new HD3 20gb mp3 walkman. I have MD. My question is if the extension work with this player... Because there is no remote for the new HD3 player... It made me sad... Now I have to buy a new HD3! :)
3,"Good sound, but...","The product quality is enough good as well as the sound, but I have very sensitive ears so to have a earphone inside my ear at barely milimeters of my eardrum is a tickect to get deaf. Also, the length of the cord is a joke (how long is it?, 20 cm?, 1 ft.?)"
3,Sony Earphones,"These earbuds are definitely a step up from the stock Ipod earphones. They are very comfortable and stay in your ears, and the sound is very good. However, the cord design is very frustrating. The cord connected to the earphones is too short to put the ipod in your pocket comfortably, and the extension cord makes it too long. The cord tends to catch in everything from the car door to knobs on the cabinets."
4,Sony Headphones : Great for IPOD Use,This product works just like the buyer reviews said. The bass from my IPOD is incredible. They are comfortable and the extension cord is a great feature. The price was a good deal. The same item sells for 50 bucks at Best Buy and Circuit City. I got these for 30.00. A 100% improvement over the set that come with the IPOD.
4,"I love the sound, not the best for working out though","So, don't want to say what already others have said about the sound. In short, I like it a lot, but I'm not a sound expert, so judge for yourself.I just wanted to write this up so others know: I'm kind of split on the 'extension' cord. Having a short cord is sometimes great. I plug it into my iphone and just attach my phone to my backpack strap when walking. Nice.But, when working out I am usually in one of two modes: listen to music on the phone or listen to the TV on treadmill or bike.When listening to musing on the phone it's not half bad, but when connecting to a device that is not on you at all time it gets really bad. Here is why: the connector between the buds and the extension cord ends up right in the middle of the 'cord'. When running, that thing dangles because of it's weight and eventually rips the buds out of your ears. So in short, not good for running on the treadmill and listening to the TV.Other than this, awesome."
4,Have A Baby? Then Don't Buy This!!!,"First of all, i am very happy with this purchase.but ...When you wear these, you cannot hear anything around you. I was using them at work and i could not hear the phone ringing right next to me. They block almost all noise coming in. So if your baby is crying in the next room, she is going to stay in that wet diaper for hours.The cord is really long. It's kinda of a pain to spin the cord around the little device to get it the length you want it. On the plus side, there are two parts to the cord. The piece that is attached to the earphones is short, perfect for the arm-band mp3 players when exercising.The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the music sounds different. The extra bass changes the music for me.For hip-hop/rap, this is perfect: 2Pac never sounded better. But for rock, it just sounds different for me.In my Opinion, These Are Worth The Purchase."
4,"Great headphones, but starting to wear...","I bought these headphones at the beginning of the summer and have really enjoyed them. They're easy to insert and sound decent. Very much worth the $30. However after 4 months of moderate use, the cable covering is starting to tear around the base of the left headphone, exposing the cables underneath. Were it not for this problem, I would give this product five stars. My only other issue is the short cable/extension cable combination. I love the short cable when I can put my iPod Shuffle in my shirt's front pocket. But when I have to use the extension cable for my pants pocket or while at the computer, the weight and size of the connectors in the middle of the cable can be awkward and cumbersome."
3,"Great Earbuds, So-so accessories","I bought these earbuds from an Apple store and I was immediately impressed by the excellent sound and comfort. If you push the earbuds all the way in they sound great and there is a lot of bass. The earbud wire is very short (so you can easily use the remote with the iPod) so I decided I would use the extender cable for the gym. WRONG. When plugged into the extender cable I only have sound out of the left earbud. I know many of you will think that I could just turn the connection, but trust me; it did NOT work. I figured it was just a bad extender and I wrote it off as that. I recently ordered a second pair, and low and behold the exact same problem. It is not my iPod because I also tried it on my fiances iPod Mini. Same result. I would highly recommend these earbuds if you do not need to extra wire, but the majority of the population will need it. Too bad Sony struck out with such a simple to make accessory. 3 stars from me."
2,My ipod earbuds are way better,"I just received these today and I don't know if I just received a bad pair but these don't even come close to the Ipod earbuds I've been using, wich are much clearer and louder. I have to turn the volume all the way up just to hear them like my Ipods wich I have at half way. I did a comparison and these just don't match up to what people have been saying. Like I said maybe mine are defective. I haven't been able to do anything to them to sound as good as my old ones. Very dissapointed."
1,Do Not Buy This version,"I bought (and returned) 2 pairs due to a faulty connection. See, this interesting version has a short cord and an extension cord, but when using the extension cord, you only get intermittant stereo in both ears due to a faulty connection that only provides stereo listening when holding really still or holding the 2 pieces together at just the right angle. I loved the IDEA of having a long and short cord, but this version is faulty and now I know why they used to be $50 and are now only $30."
3,great sound not so great warranty,"These headphones sound great. I had mine for six months before one side just stopped working mysteriously. Now Sony wants me to pay $24 dollars to replace them. I'm not sure if it is worth it. Maybe I should just find a more solid pair of earbud headphones. I probably will give sony another chance though, because these headphones sound great. If you are going to purchase these, keep in mind that they might not last more than a couple of months, and that you will have to pay to get them serviced by sony. In hindsight I think it would have been good if I purchased an extended warranty. I usually don't do that, but in this case it would have saved me $18."
5,The Greatest,"My dad is a big fan of Muhammad Ali. He would never tire out watching replays of Ali's fights on espn. Since a was a kid, I knew that one of my Dad's price possession is a framed poster of Ali in the classic moment of knocking out Sonny liston.We have changed residence for a couple of times, but this framed poster always occupied a nice place in our home. When I saw this figure of NECA, i didn't hesitate to order one for my dad. I thought it would be a great father's day gift. When it was finally delivered to him, my mom told me tears welled on his eyes.I have seen exactly the same product and I think it is really a great product.It will be appreciated by anyone for it's great craftmanship and being a slice of history."
5,My two favorite KT songs?,"On one CD/Cassette? I don't believe it. These are two incredible songs. S + M (a love song) is one of the most upbeat, haunting songs I've ever heard, absolutely exuding power, very industrial in nature. Feathers is beautiful. Just, outright beautiful. There's little more I can say than that. If you like these, check out Trickster. If you like the way these sound, check out Zerospace. If you like KT, which you do, check out Live In Chicago 2002..."
4,great toaster,"got this for the office... people complain that it ""smells like something is burning"" whenever anyone uses it, but for the price, its a great office toaster."
1,Too expensive,"Yes it does toast bread but it does so unevenly. If you want to take the toast out before it pops up, you have to unplug the toaster - very annoying. Not worth the price as it really is a cheap toaster."
4,Good reliable toaster,"I have the Cool-Wall model 22447 that looks exactly like this and was highly rated by CR review a few years ago. I've been quite happy with mine. Toasters get daily use, internal parts have to deal with a lot of heat stress, and normally they don't last more than a few years. Mine is 3.5 yrs old and going strong. Good buy for the price."
3,Richard,"Bought this toaster to replace old toaster that needed a new cord, it too was a Proctor Silex product. The old toaster was 1000 watts, this one is 900 watts and takes twice the time to toast. If you are keeping an eye on you energy cost this is not the toaster for you, being it takes twice as long to toast. It is difficult to end toasting manually. After comparing the new toaster with the old I found that there were less heating elements in the new toaster, ""explains longer toasting time"". The price was a fair price but after using it for a time I went to the hardware store and got a new cord and put our old toaster back in service. What did we do with the new toaster? It's in the recycle been."
1,Broken out of the box,"I bought this toaster at a local store today. Took it out of the box, plugged it in, put in a piece of bread, pushed it down and it popped right back up. Tried several times. Nada. The catch mechanism to keep the bread down was obviously defective. I'm taking it back to the store for a refund and will get something decent from Amazon. Don't buy this piece of garbage."
5,Wow... cheap AND it works!,"Who would have thought the least expensive toaster I'd ever purchased would be the best at its toasting task...Both sides of my bread come out browned pretty evenly. Yes, the outside of the toaster gets hot, but I'd rather have that than an expensive insulated model that doesn't toast evenly. I also like the fact that the slots in this are wide enough for a bagel.What a deal!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Toaster has nice clean lines and mechanically works well. Toast was fairly even. We don't make a lot of toast, maybe a dozen slices a week. Nevertheless, it died on us after one year and two months. If you need something for just a short time, it will probably due the trick, but if you are after a lasting relationship, we would recommend getting something else. . . ."
1,Worst toaster ever!,"I wish I hadn't wasted my money. This toaster is pathetic. You can't pop up the toast early if you want to, it toasts unevenly, the cord is ridiculously short and is connected at the front instead of the back, so even plugging it in is irritating. I just bought a new, working, useful toaster and this one hit the dumpster. Don't waste your time or money on this junk!"
4,It's good,"Serves the purpose for me. I just needed a toaster that could toast my bread well, and it seems to do that. Only sometimes, I need to re-toast twice, but maybe it's the bread I use? Dunno."
5,Socially Constructed Ontology,"The possibilities of what can be found to be true or become true have opened up with our advance in technology. There are things that we can make true today that have never been true before. (Idea from Hacking interpreting Foucault). This might also be called Darwinizing Ontology with reference to ""Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics As a Science"" - by Robert Aunger. So this is still one more the evolution narrative is being used to convert our previous understanding."
1,Horrible movie.,I love Horror movies but for me this one went way to far. If your a parent and don't want to see kids being butchered by their mom then I wouldn't watch this one. I tried and tried to find what true story this was based on and couldn't find one. The closest thing I can come up with is the mom about 5 or 6yrs. ago who drowned all her children over a period of 5 or 6 hrs. Hated the movie.
3,Metric scale not ideal for standard measurements,"Oops. They forgot to mention that every time you power on the scale it defaults to metric. You must press a tiny button to switch it at each use. My wife hated it!Besides that, the scale is small, well built and surprisingly stable."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't bother buying this because Mustek does not offer any support at all! Not even user manuals (I lost mine)! It was a waste of the $60 I paid. The camera works, but it is just average at best. Now I don't have a manual and can't even get one. There is no excuse for this except the company just does not care. This camera is now just JUNK! Worthless without support. So, don't waste your money on any Mustek product since they don't support what they sell...The rating of one star is because they do let us rate with zero stars which is what I would give this product if I could!"
3,"Cost Too Much, But Had To Have Them","I have to agree with everyone on cost. Way too much for 500 nails, but what are you gonna do if you got to have them. I bought some 31/2"" back in 2005 and they cost a lot also, $34.00 for 500. Since Amazon is the one selling these nails, I have to ding them on the price, even with Free Shipping. # rating because of cost. Have not tried them yet, but they better work real well...."
4,I Don't Have to Be Normal After All,"In her light and honest style, Patsy Clairmont shares humorous anecdotes that emphasize how wonderful it is that we are all unique individuals. All of the short stories illustrate how God loves us the way we are (warts and all!) and how He created each of us with different personalities and abilities. Ms. Clairmont will leave you feeling uplifted and encouraged - whether you're ""normal"" or not!"
4,One of the kind,"Whatever is being said about Black Sabbath's Seventh Star, the album remains one of the kind Black Sabbath- or Tony Iommi-, as you prefer, release in a sense that it accentuates Iommi's talent as a lead/rhythm guitar virtuoso and his overall exquisite musical taste. I think his personal courage to agree to release an album (even under the contract obligation) at the time when no other member of the original band was willing or able to join is also to be admired. One can argue whether or not it sounds like genuine Black Sabbath. It certainly does not. But what, after all, is a genuine Black Sabbath sound? Fans go to lengthy arguments as to whether the band sounded best with Ozzy, Dio, or Tony Martin as lead singers. If you distance yourself from these clichés, you will find Seventh Star with Glen Hughes to be a powerful album, and, in my view, more refreshing than the overall gloomy-style Sabbath material. Enjoy!"
3,Not exactly the Sabbath we've used to know,"Overall the music on this CD is good but it's way below the expectations of the early 70's Black Sabbath albums when they had Ozzy Osbourne (vocals, Geezer Butler (bass), Bill Ward (drums) and Tony Iommi (guitar). Tony Iommi is the only original member left while the others left, Glenn Hughes is a good singer but he is no Ozzy or Dio and the sound is too radio friendly.If you love 80's rock or metal, this CD is worthy enough to add to your collection as long as you don't compare it to the early 70's Sabbath and only diehard Sabbath fans should get this CD."
5,Recently Found Rare Sabbath,I didn't even know of this Sabbath CD until recently. I have them all now. As good as any other Sabbath after Ozzy departing.I'm very happy with it.You definitely hear Tony Iommi on guitar. A must have for any Sabbath collector.
4,Good value,"For the cost, great value. The watch looks great and holds up well. Runs a little fast, usually have to adjust every week or so."
4,Need to clarify something...,"Jason-let's not get carried away here. The Circle album was indeed a ground-breaking effort (of which the impact is still felt today), but to say it single-handedly saved bluegrass music is absurd. And one more thing...Uncle Charlie came out BEFORE Cirlce--the boys didn't hone their chops for Uncle Charlie during the Circle sessions because Uncle Charlie was already out. Nevertheless, the point is ALL of NGDB's early work (up to the Symphonium Dream album) is definitely worth checking out."
4,Good BASIC intro,Nice intro but very BASIC. If that's what you are looking for...it's the one to buy.
2,Just O.K.,"I got the 2 in 1 free when I purchased a Bostitch 15 gauge finish nailer. I haven't used it as a brad nailer, only as a stapler. I would have to say I am a bit disapointed. This gun rarely counter sinks into any materials I've tried it on. It leaves the staples flush with the surface or slightly protruding. The 2 in 1 one has never jammed on me, but I can't in good conscience recommend it either. If I had not gotten it for free I would have returned it for a dedicated finish stapler."
4,Nice dual purpose tool for most people.,"I have used this gun on numerous projects. Shooting plywood veneer to the backside of cabinetry with staples gives great holding power. Also great for stapling carpet and padded fabrics to ""home made"" storage ottomans. I have used it on crown moldings with brads and this also works fine, BUT, if a clear finish is desired, you WILL get a ""staple sized"" divot ! AWESOME, only if you intend on painting your trim work ! ALWAYS TEST your dual purpose gun BEFORE you shoot in a visible area to see what your final result will be. All in all, this gun is great for the average user, but NOT for the SERIOUS cabinet maker where stain and lacquer will be used to finish, as ANY fastener must be concealed to let only the beauty of the wood to be seen... I have yet to experience any problems with the mechanics of this gun and it works very well for me. Once again, TEST FIRE, before you shoot in a visible area to be SAFE !!!"
4,Good Value,"i was only looking to buy one of the games in this two pack, but after pricing, this vendor was selling his two pack for the same price the others were asking for the one! Arrived new as promised."
3,Good Thing in a Small Package,"This slim volume by co-authors Zonderman (a writer with Crohns Disease) and his gastroenterologist Vender packs a lot of punch in a brief amount of time. Very up to date in terms of medication information and surgery, the authors also do an excellent job of describing the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease and WHY you are feeling this way (something I've yet to come across in any other book on IBD). I was disappointed in the primitive line drawings used to illustrate the book and in the negative attitude toward some alternative medical treatments discussed in the ""mind/body"" chapter (although I was pleased to see its inclusion). The authors should be commended for approaching the emotional aspects of IBD in a forthright manner and the book would be an appropriate addition to any IBD library."
1,"Ms. Truman, could you please (...) ME instead?","I had to read this book for school. I don't know WHY. All the characters were identical, the plot was confusing, and the end had no real explanation whatsoever. It took me a MONTH to read this garbage. I think she's just riding on the wave of her Daddy's fame from his presidency and never actually bothered to take writing lessons."
4,It really helps!,"This CLEP book is great! It is a general overview of almost everything that will be found on a CLEP. It even includes practice tests with an explanation of answers. This is very helpful because it fills in many of the gaps that occured, because you didn't actually take the class. The book is also written in a pretty user friendly way. With thanks to it, I sucessfully CLEPed Intro to Psychology!"
3,Nice package,"I was curious about the KY yours and mine lube. It wasn't as awesome as I thought it would be. In fact, it was very average. My personal favorite item in this little package is the silver bullet vibrator. Holy cow, that thing has some kick ;) The finger vibrator was very very meh, I don't think we'll even take it out of the package. The mini vibrator kit is just average too. All together, if you're looking to spice things up without getting too crazy this kits for you."
5,book lover,"This is one of my favorite books about herbs and herbal remedy. It is complex in every herb, plant and tree. Very interesting. I bought this book for my sister in Canada and she love it. I will recommend to people who love to know more about herbs. The book cover everything including planting to natural remedy."
5,Great read,"I bought this for my hubby.He is struggling with how to cope with our sons recent diagnosis. He isn't much of a reader but he keeps telling me, ""I read in that book...."" Or ""the book says........""."
1,No!,"I adore Irish music. This is really not it! Boring, unlively, monotone interpretations of the Irish reels. There are hundreds of records out there containing the same stuff, but at least with some decent quality!"
4,Science Made Fun? Whodda Thunk It,"As a person who avoided all science in school, I surprised myself by buying this book, and then ENJOYING IT! This book is great at examining science fiction, and showing how some of it may turn into science fact. And it lets you sleep more soundly if you were really concerned about alien invasions. Even sound smart when someone mentions that Schroedenger's Cat puzzle you could never figure out in school. A MUST read."
5,A riot!,"I've read this book 3 times! Very funny and very much needed. Maybe Trey Parker and Matt Stone can put a movie short out on it before Ron Howard and Tom Hanks finish the real thing. Buy it, you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll kiss a few bucks goodbye..."
5,The Best Of The Andy Hardy Films.,"Andy Hardy Meets Debutante was the best of the Andy Hardy films. Diana Lewis played Daphne Fowler, Diana's best friend was Carole Landis. Diana gave Carole a gold cross in 1938 that she wore for the rest of her life. William Powell and Diana knew each other for only a few weeks when they eloped. He had previously been married to Carole Lombard and engaged to Jean Harlow. The little boy who played Francis/Butch would have stole the movie had it not been for Judy Garland. Judy singing ""I'm Nobody's Baby"" is the highlight of the movie. Louis B. Mayer had a very strong hand in the way The Andy Hardy movies were done, he always said they were the best films MGM ever made.The films gave a start to many young actors, Judy Garland, Esther Williams, Donna Reed, Kathryn Grayson, and of course Judy Garland."
2,"Love Garland, but Can't Handle Mickey Rooney",This is the second film I've seen with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney and I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a Mickey Rooney fan--he's just so over the top. My recommendation--if you like Garland go for the ones without Mickey Rooney. I watched this one once and gave it away.
2,wow what a wierd movie,"I love Dean Koontz and have all his books. The movie was wierd. Not like the book. I loved the book and it freaked me out. the movie was just wierd. The acting was not that good. It lacked conviction, passion and realism. Man, they sure could have done a lot better then the end result. Still movie was ok. The boy in the movie was sadly to say, poor acting. But then again, so where the adults, even the bugs were poor acting - lol. I gave it a 2 stars for effort. Unless you love Koontz and collect all his stuff, you may want to pass on this one. LOL."
1,Looks like the right CD... but it's not,"To see my comment, please check out the 1-star review that BlueNote wrote. I made a comment off his review about how the same thing happened to me. BEWARE!! The CD you receive will probably not be the one you ordered!!"
4,Hot Dip Galv Nails are superior,"Hot dip galvanized nails are the nails of choice for fiber cement siding products. They will last longer than standard galvanized nails.These Hot dip galvanized nails are plastic collated, and you need a special nail gun that will allow the plastic collation to be ejected from the gun.Do not buy these nails if your gun is not equipped for plastic collated nails!In addition to the compatable guns that amazon.com/toolcrib catalog mentions, these nails will also work with the Porter Cable coil200. (Porter Cable recommends that the coil200 use nails that are a maximum of 2"" long, although the gun itself can be loaded with 2 3/8"" nails if you want to ignore the warrantee.)"
2,THIS IS ONLY AN EXTRA SPEAKER,"Be careful when you order this item. Even though the picture above shows the speaker with the transmitter, this product is just the speaker. If you don't already have a transmitter, you want to get item number SRSRF90RK."
5,5 stars for content!,"Although the presentation of the material may seem dry to people looking for juicy contraversies/""issues"" in medicine, the book will prove quite savory indeed for those looking for historic facts in the development of naturopathic medicine in the U.S.This book is a must-read for those wishing to grasp the historic record of naturopathic roots and its intended direction to change the way medicine is practiced. Lust, the founder of naturopathy, was not blinded by idealism in the sense that a physician should only use what were historically known as the natural/alternative therapies. Instead, he insisted that the doctor of the future will be a regular physician who has changed his (or her) ways; that is, use what medicines and methods that have historically proven meritous AND embrace and integrate new, well-founded knowledge in science and medicine as well.Get this book. It will open your eyes!!!"
1,The worst manga I've ever read.,"I would honestly say this is the worst manga I've read. There are absolutely impossible coincedences that never fail to happen over and over again that place the main characters in (literally) comprimising positions. Although this manga has a 16+ rating, being 16 myself I felt that it deserved mature because just about every single page the girl was bordering full nudity.I'd also say that a low point is how all the women are portrayed as loose and always skimpily dressed. Showing my feminist side here, it could really be offending!I would not recommend this manga to anyone, not only for the reasons listed above, but it's extremely predictable and the artwork isn't anything worth mentioning. If you want to read a good manga, I'd recommend Trinity Blood."
4,I love the effect of these rollers!,"I used two brownish colors right next to each other on the color strip and my walls turned out gorgeous! Using the wool rollers, the effect is sort of a sueded leather look, and people comment that it looks like a decorator created it. It was very easy to do, I absolutely love it. We used painters tape along the ceiling and the trim, and used a paint brush to blend in. Watch the video to get the idea. I would buy this product again. My only caveat is if you have a very large area to do you might want to purchase 2 sets because mine sort of fell apart after painting all the open walls throughout my home and I had to order another set. However, it is a very large square foot area, so if you just have one or two average size rooms to do, one set should work fine."
1,Save your money.,"If you're interested in Sidaris films, you're obviously not looking for quality, but this one doesn't even live up to Sidaris' standards."
2,Stale and chewy,"I bought these as a garnish for my ramen noodles. But I noticed that even after rehydration, these chopped green onions often had bits that were stale & chewy. My local Japanese grocery store had some dried/sealed scallion packs that tasted much better. And my local supermarket had some dried chopped chives (part of the onion family) in a plastic container that also worked better."
2,Not a good buy,I returned the item. It was heavy and hard to attach to your screen. I felt it was going to fall off at any time.
1,Poor quality...,"Same as previous reviewers. I have had these speakers for a couple of years and each time I plug them in, they make me cring. There is absolutely no bass response. Most computer speakers today sound better than these."
2,Waste of a good start,"Here is a story that just merely starts with a neat premise and very quickly meanders. The authors' attempt to explain the intricacies of Indian family, religion, and topography of Sri Lanka ( Probably Jaffna more likely Mullaitivu) are all consistently awful.It gets worse with two dimensional glum characters and recurring single dimensional characters (Just names)thrown in the middle of the unnecessary detours. The closest experience to this was trying to listen to my neighbour's kid playing the Alto sax. He sure did hit all the high notes but just missed the music part."
1,"Tedious, Disconnected","I don't know why I finished reading The Eye in the Pyramid. It was a tedious flow of disconnects. Sure, it's a story about conspiracies dating back to Atlantis, but there was virtually nothing about the book to recommend, and saying so doesn't make me one of ""Them."""
4,"Good Product, but no compatible with plasma TVs","Great product when watching TV on a LCD, but these wireless headphones are definetely not to use with a Plasma TV. Too much interference."
3,NOT FOR THE TREADMILL!!!,"These headphones work well when there are no other electronic devices nearby, but don't get too close to an incandescent light fixture and definitely don't try to use them on the treadmill. The electric motor causes major interference which generates so much static they are not usable."
4,Sony Wireless Headphones,I am satisfied with the model. It could have better sound but at the price it works just fine for me when I'm watching TV and don't want to disturbe other in the house.
2,Only get this if you don't like quality sound,"Well, I had high hopes for this product. I should have known better. Basically, you get a lot of static no matter how you adjust the knobs. Nuff said. Always that background noise, no matter what. This will work if you are watching TV in bed and don't want to wake the wife, but forget any sense of realism if you want immersive sound in a gamer environment or quality live music. I returned my set after about 40 minutes out of the box. Plus, you have to really aim the IR transmitter perfectly just to get a decent signal, and it cuts out any time you move around or place your hand in front of your face. Much better to suffer the wire than to purchase this. Don't do it."
4,Work Great!,"Charged them overnight, hooked up to the TV and they worked great. No issue with background noise. Volume adjustment is a bit small and may not be easy to use if you have big fingers."
4,Very Nice,"Nice set of headphones for watching late night TV. Haven't had any issues so far. The SRS feature isn't that great and the vibration mode really is pointless. The soft earpads are also nice, but they have to be replaced eventually because they are made from a soft material. Other than that, these sound and work nicely."
2,Great headphones at first.,"Had a pair of these that seemed to work great, so I bought another pair for my wife. Headphones are simply better than speakers, especially great for blu-ray audio. Anyway, it started on my headset first. when I went to adjust the volume only one earphone would work, rolling the volume dial would eventually give you stereo. Then the volume would not work properly. If I played with it I could get it to work, but not without using the headphones with a dial rolling ritual first. A few months later the same happened with my other set. Looking at the reviews I seem to be in the minority, but ""two"" sets with the same problem?"
1,Not what I expected,I was looking for material that could be used with Middle/High school students. This DVD is entirely too slow to be used with them. An individual may have the patience to use it but even then it is not very helpful for learning.
2,Very Disapointed,"They do a good job of filtering outside noise, but these headphones are not for use if you are searching for serious volume. Quality is not bad, but I really expected a richer experience. Keep in mind I mostly listen to classical motion picture soundtracks, so if you listen to Rock/Rap, you may be happier than I was.Clunky headband is not great for anything but home use also.These are not real expensive headphones, and I suppose I was taken in a little by the brand name, and had higher expectations than I should have. Had I listened to them in a store, I would have kept searching."
2,Tough to like,"Wore these headphones for one lawn mowing. Was looking for a product where I could listen to music while mowing the lawn. My head hurt so bad after 1/2 hour I had a headache the rest of the day. Product is extremely tight, very heavy and bulky. Good news is the company that sells this product through Amazon is very very good at handling returns."
5,Great with Audio books,I enjoy listening to audio books. Regular ear phones were not enough to drown out the noise and hear the book when I use my riding lawn tractor. These Race Tracker Stereophones are just what I needed. I really hate cutting grass but now I can at lease enjoy a good book. Only drawback is I cannot wear my wide brim sun hat with these stereophones.
2,Too uncomfortable for wear,"While they do offer good sound, they were too uncomfortable to wear for longer than 5 minutes. The headband is not adjustable, and it was so tight on my head I thought my eyeballs were going to burst out of their sockets. As for as blocking out outside sound, they didn't fare well there either. I had to turn my music up unbearably loud just to block out low voices. I would not suggest this product at all."
5,Excellent,"Same as the black I purchased for myself. Fits great, gives you something to hold onto, can still plug in a FM transmitter. Great protection for the little iPod Nano."
2,not a very impressive collection,"I didn't know a whole alot about Blancmange when I decided to purchase this album. I had seen the ""Living On The Ceiling"" music video on an 80'sMTV channel & heard ""Don't Tell Me"" on satellite radio. I'd figure this collection would be to my liking, but I was disappointed. Alot of the tracks weren't memorable or catchy. ""God's Kitchen"", ""I've Seen The Word"" & ""Feel Me"" are good songs, they have that Talking Heads vibe to them. I'm not sorry I purchased this album, for I enjoyed a small percentage of these songs."
3,Wish I could go 3 and 1\2 stars,"For an unknown, this was surprisingly good. I do tend to agree with the other reviewers here. The copyeiting in places is not the best, but then again, I have read books that have had it worse. To me, the characters and the interactions make this a very worth while read.They are all very similar ((on purpose it appears)) but found each one intriquing, with heir own past's of hardships and character building events. Personally, Adarm and the Master seemed very blah at first, UNTIL I read deeper into the book. Things are not always as they seem.Even with Mr. Broda being an unknown, i liked it and look forward to more. Maybe not in this series...givin its ending...but something newer and fresh."
5,Excellent Information,"The DVD is complete, simple and very helpful for ideas about well being on a mental, spiritual and physical levels. I liked it so much that I plan to give friends copies of the DVD as an empowering gift for well-being.The Book 3 IN 1 by the same author was and is also excellent (I am still reading it). It simplifies ones life and it makes sense about how to eat in harmoney and circumvent or solve those problems with craving.I love both and recommend them highly.Lamees"
4,"decent ""kick in the pants"" stack","Ive used supplements from numerous manufacturers over the years and have come to find Muscletech is always in my top three. This stack is not meant to be some miracle stack where you suddenly become fit. It is however a nice way to push through plateaus. I used the Leukic and Gakic a few months ago and was happy with the results, but did find better progress stacking with Celltech and Hydroxycut Hardcore. As long as you don't expect this to be a miracle stack, as it is only a two week supply, this is a good product at a decent price (i paid like 51 bones)."
2,Problems i have had,"The SC-HT650 has one major problem that I have found with the two different models that I have bought and returned, the fan that keeps the dvd player cool does't work and causes the module to overheat and shut down. The Longest that I have had the thing running at one time is two hours before it shuts down."
2,500 watts?,"i just bought this panasonic ""SC-HT650"" home theater system and i put the model number in parenthesis because on the dvd player the model number reads SA-HT650. i took back my philips mx 3660d home theater system to buy this pansonic model, the philps model was 300 watts and sounded extremely better than the panasonic ""500"" watts that i just recently bought. i was wondering how a 300 watt system could be louder than a ""500"" watt system. and today i was changing the sound to surround sound and came this ear piercing noise coming from the system that was heard from 3 rooms away, still trying to figure out what that was. its a 5 disc changer and it takes forever for a disc to change. i had a VENTURER 130 watt sytem that sounded better than this ""500"" watt system!"
3,"No coupler, few instructions.","I was surprised and disappointed to find that I had to go to the store and buy a 1/4-inch Male NPT Plug before I could hook it up to my air hose and use it. This ""kit"" ships with a bunch of things that I'll rarely, if ever use, but doesn't have the connector that every user will need in order to actually use it.Secondly, there are no instructions as to what to do with the stuff, other than the nailer itself, that comes in the kit.Somebody at Bostitch was asleep when they put this package together!PS: I got that coupler and tried it out and it seems to work just fine."
2,First time using this brand,"I took a chance and bought this product, mainly because it got some good reviews. My review however is not going to be very kind. This nailer works when it wants to, and it is disappointing and frustrating to wait for this nailer to start driving the nail. The owners manual is also lacking in information to trouble shoot this problem. I feel that the money I paid for this item was wasted. And I do not recommend this product. Richard,"
1,VERY POOR OPERATION MANUAL,VERY POOR MANUAL---IF THE SPARE PARTS WERE INSTALLED THE WRONG WAY---NO TELLING WHAT COULD HAPPEN
4,Fun and Useful,"I didn't know what to expect at first.Bent a few nails but after a little practice, drove many straight nails in hard old oak 2x6s.The manual is next to useless but I think I can follow the diagram to change the heads. I have used the standard head for all my work but sometime I will need to change to the smaller size.A great tool but the sorry manual keeps it a 4 star."
4,Nailed it,"I had low expectations for this nailer. I had hard, thick stock (an oak fence) and did not have a lot of confidence that a small, low power tool would work. This tool greatly exceed my expectations. The only problem that I had was that the nails would bend if I did not use care and I probably could have solved that problem if I had used a longer head. Documentation could be better."
1,Possible replacement substitute?,"I'm thinking that this bulb would be equivalent to the ""GEL19376"" halogen bulb, anyone know?"
2,Touches just the surface and lacks opinion,"We are just back from vacationing on Maui using both this book and the Maui Revealed. For starters, 190 pages didn't provide nearly enough information. Many of the places it lists would be fun to visit but we couldn't figure out the good from the bad as we drove by. The stripped down information severely mars the books usefulness as an actual travelguide."
2,not so good,This guide leaves out alot of things. Glancing at the reviews made it sound worthwhile buying but using it on our trip to Maui was a big big letdown. We learned alot more using the tried and true and accurate Frommer's brand.
4,eBook is your best bet - It's FULL color!,"Read many reviews about this book before I purchased it and ultimately I purchased both the eBook and the physical book. As many other reviewers here and elsewhere have said, the physical book is black and white internally. However the eBook is FULL color and is quite convenient in helping plan for your trip, especially alongside the physical book.The guide is well written and easy to use. This is a driving guide only, for sights and activities along the major roads. It's geared towards an outdoor crowd. It should be an asset to Maui vacationers everywhere."
4,Useful guide for east Maui,"I think a few of the reviewers for this book have been overly critical while others have embellished the book. Here's the facts.This is one of the easiest to follow books available for Maui. You will not find a better book for east maui - that includes the road to hana, south maui, and haleakala. The book needs additions for west maui, but its coverage is second to none for everything else.The photos are, I'll agree, disappointing given they are b/w. I grabbed a copy of the digital book as well and found that to adequately make up for the books photos. In fact I almost wish I'd done that to begin with as it was quite useful.I took along revealed and frommer's on this trip as well. I disliked Frommer's immensely. I really enjoyed revealed but found their lack of detail and trespassing a real downer. Mile by Mile works and I think it's worth the ten bucks."
1,Rerum Novarum Played Atlas Shrugged....Rerum Novarum Lost,"The ever tendentious and propagandistic Robert Sirico could get his mind around denying his own kind their basic human rights, but cannot stretch to consider that the numerous encyclicals of his own faith about helping the poor might have some over-arching political character. In response to the appearance of the current Republican Speaker of the House at a Catholic commencement ceremony, which occasioned an epistolary rebuke from some academicians, he is sticking to his defense of a Catholic version of Atlas Shrugged. Whatever the cinematic virtues that a movie like this conceivably might have, for anyone to know that a mind some benumbed to basic intellectual sense and human decency, like Sirico's, is behind it should make it only approachable with extreme caution and revulsion. Let the world be safe for entrepreneurs, but also safe from Ayn Rand with an M. Div. and an attitude. For that is all that is there."
4,Great unit for the price,"While the interface can be confusing to navigate at times the complete integration of XM, CD and AM/FM radio into one unit for under $100 is a great deal. If I were to have a need to purchase another head unit I am certain it would be another one of these. It would be nice if it was capable of playing mp3 disks but overall I have been pleased with this purchase."
1,Do not buy for Kindle. Formatting renders unreadable.,"The book 777 is not properly formatted for Kindle. The charts are unusable and there is no attempt to present them as charts - they run on page after page with no delineation. Also, the symbols are not displayed: Arabic, Hebrew, Coptic, et al alphabets do not appear on the Kindle. Further, the books Gematria and Sepher Sephiroth are not included as they are in the print edition.If you wish to read this book, you must buy the print edition. The Kindle edition is completely unusable."
2,"Score for Kindle edition on iPhone, NOT for Crowley's work","I have this work as a real book and treasure it for the clarity of its information around correspondences between everything from Hebrew letters to colors to herbs to planets, etc. Amazing piece of work, and even in book form it's clearly something that took a lot of care and understanding to lay out on consecutive pages. Not an easy task.The problem here is that at least when looking at the Kindle edition on my iPhone, there is no Hebrew character set, so there is a lot of confusing gobble-d-gunk. Beyond that, scrolling from page to page on a screen is not the same as thumbing back and forth between, say, page 16 and page 20 of a book. There is linear and jump-to browsing, which is really different than reading an actual book.But this is paradigm shifting stuff and maybe I'm just too old. The real problem still remains: no Hebrew character set. This makes this edition, at least on the iPhone, nearly useless."
4,Great little mister,The product was delivered quickly. Reasonably priced. Nice size (not too tiny). Works very well.
3,Buy this only if you need independent front/back control,"The Racor Hoist Monster and the Kettler Bicycle Lifter are the competition for this product. I have tried all of the hoists that I mention. The Racor and Kettler have one continuous rope that routs through all the pulleys--so they have 4:1 mechanical advantage. This product has 2 independent ropes, so it only has 2:1 mechanical advantage. YOU CANNOT LIFT 200 POUNDS WITH THIS PRODUCT--with only 2:1 mechanical advantage you have to be a strong person to lift 50 pounds. The advantage of this product is that you can control the front and back pulley independently. If you don't need this capability, buy the Racor for $21 if you don't mind a bit of a cheap feeling product (but it works fine), or buy the Kettler for $50 if you want a super slick product that works beautifully and has the best locking mechanism."
5,Excellent solution for avoiding scratches on your Macbook Pro,"Hey..if you want to keep your macbook looking new for a long time, I would highly recommend this product.The hand-rest protector is really helpful to avoid scratches and nips from your watch, etc. The screen cleaner is an added plus. I have really not used the mouse-trackpad protector.Also, the material is very nice and completely blends in with the color of the pro. and the sheet does NOT prevent the screen from latching with the body when you shut it close.overall- Great product!"
1,Poorest Sabbath album,"This is little more than a bootleg, and of less than exceptional performances to boot. The entire album is poor on every level and isn't recommended except for completists like myself. This travesty floated around K-Marts for years as a horrendously packaged bargain-bin item before someone got the idea to 'remaster' it and mark it up. There is little discernible difference in the easily found $5 version and the reissue. So I say, look for the cheaper old one if you must have this. I got burned by also buying the reissue, you don't have to make that mistake."
3,In Search of the Right Candidate for the Supreme Court,"I have loved reading all William Coughlin books and was really only terribly disappointed with ""The Heart of Justice"" published posthumously. I felt he had not finished it prior to his death and it did not have the life and humor of his other works. I saw that The Court was a reprint of his earlier book and was happy to find it. I did enjoy it because I accepted that it might not show the skill displayed in his later novels. It was a simple book, really, but I found it a pleasure to read. I did find it a bit unusual that the President would place such faith in one man's opinion of his choice for the Supreme Court, but I enjoyed the ride. For those who are upset, I feel it is his widow, Ruth, who is probably publishing Bill's earlier works. Read her book ""Grieving"" and you will never doubt her love for him. I don't believe she would ever publish anything that would hurt him or diminish his reputation as a fine writer."
3,An average read.,"I had this sent to me as a gift as it is not a book that I would ever pay full price for. It was a fine book that talks about Yao's notable first season.there are some great chapters on other players and the tie-in to Chinese literature and Taoism is clever, at times. However, I found it repetitive that almost every chapter went on and on about how great Yao will be. I have no doubt that this is true, but do we have to hear that from every player, legend, or sports caster that the book interviewed?Overall, it was interesting but I would have liked to hear more about his youth, childhood and upbringing rather than chapter after chapter of his ""potential."""
4,Running time?,"I just ordered this so I don't have it yet, but the ""Product Review"" here states a running time of 60 minutes. It has to be considerably longer than that. I saw on another site that it contains 17 episodes including the TV movie ""Return to Mayberry."" The movie alone is probably 90 minutes to two hours. Does anyone know the correct running time?"
4,Great collection but...,"I love the collection of shows on the DVD. They are in the original format AS they were shown back in the 60's, commercial spots and all...which is AWESOME! You never see Andy and Opie walking BACK from the fishing hole!!! It great. It also has a bit of trivia before each show. The downer is that they don't auto play or play all option. You must select each show to play. It's inconvenient but not enough to trade it in. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5."
3,cute and oddly entertaining,"This book was entertaining... it was light, fun and very easy to get through. As chic-lit goes, it won't be at the top of my list but nonetheless it's okay by me. I liked the characters, but I thought it odd that Max would tell her the lie about the ""goddaugther"", the reason for it didn't really grab me..that was a bit far fetched. Still it's fun.. pick it up and see what you think."
3,"Same story, different title!","Well, I have now read all three of Sue Margolis' books - I really enjoyed Neurotica, but Spin Cycle and now Apocalipstick are just so-so. This one felt so similiar to the other two - the main character, spunky single woman, either has a sexually dysfunctional partner, or KNOWS someone with a sexually dysfunctional partner. She has some predictable flings (I almost laughed when they broke out the oil yet again during one of their ""intimate moments"". Oil was rubbed into her buttocks in each of the other two books. Hmmmm, must be an English thing, I guess). It was also odd that everytime someone cried in this book it was ""a single tear rolled down her cheek"" - I kid you not, this happened EVERY time! This book just felt like it was being churned out and not written; it wasn't very original."
1,Is this a Joke?,"Leave out the ridiculous sex scenes and this book should be aimed at pre-teens. It's not funny or clever enough to qualify as a spoof, it's just a poorly developed cast of lame characters, and a childish ""plot"" if it can be called that. The fact that this book made it into print amazes me, but I suppose a contract with an advance had to be met.This book is a joke that just isn't funny."
1,I Found A Big Mistake,"Not only was this story predictable and cringe-worthy in certain parts, but Sue Margolis forgot that when her character Rebecca was a teen in the eighties, nobody described Retin-A for pimples. This blaring error made a forced plot even more unlikely.Very disappointing, especially since the last two novels were fun and refreshing."
2,B & C Eagle Framing Nails,I would not recommend these nails. They often get stuck in the magazine and have to be readjusted to continue nailing.
1,Sales pitch in a book,"This book is a disguised sales pitch for a line of clubs and method that are based on the late Moe Norman's swing.Moe was probably the best ball striker of all time, but this book isn't about swinging like him, rather it's a pitch to get into your wallet again, and again, and again. Don't bite.I should have put the money for this book toward a used hybrid club."
3,Good at first but maybe having some issues...,"Like the reviews before, this is a great improvement over Samsung's OEM battery, at least at first. Just recently Im noticing a possible decrease in its effectiveness, like a very sudden onset of battery memory. I've been using this bat for about a month as of right now. I've only had a couple of charge cycles to notice, so I'm not entirely sure if there's a problem yet or if I'm just miscounting the days I charged on. I'll update this when I have this sorted out, but it is a $15 off brand battery. Well reviewed, well priced, but take a grain of salt. I've been pleased with it until, coincidentally, just now when Amazon reminds me to review it."
4,Forgiveness : A Bold Choice for a Peaceful Heart,"This book is very good and it's full of reasons to give you peace. Probably you've heard or read most of them before, but this is a good compendium to keep in mind when you have been wronged or you are carrying the burden of revenge or hate."
5,Awesome Vac,"The vaccum arrived in excellent condition and lived up to its hype. Looks very sleek, modern and does an excellent job and is relatively quiet."
3,"love the device, hate the screen","I went to [local store], played around with all the Palm PDAs on display, and picked this one because of its small size and high-res screen. Got it home, and guess what? the screen is next to impossible for me to read. If I were under 30, it would probably be OK; if I were using it mostly under fluorescent lights, I could probably live with it. But, given my middle-aged eyes, and working under mostly incandescent or natural light, I can't find a lighting situation that gets rid of the glare and makes the display possible to read without agonizing squinting.It's a shame, because apart from the display, it's a great little PDA, especially for the price. BTW, I'm a Mac user, dowloaded the appropriate software ..., and have had no trouble hotsyncing with my Mac. I'm considering upgrading to the Palm m500 because it has a display I can actually read."
4,good features but display is difficult to read,"The T415 is my first PDA. I'm impressed with the features and speed of this product. I was able to set up the IR port with my Dell Latitude w/o difficulty, which enabled cable-free copy and synchronization with my contact manager (Goldmine v5.x).The pen-free, ""jog dial"" navigation makes a lot more sense than fiddling with the tiny stylus.The only problem with the T415 is the dim display. I didn't notice this issue at first. But, after a long day or airline flight, I find that it's practically unreadable. I'm upgrading to the color Clie when time permits."
4,not bad but too PC-centric,The screen it hi-res but too hard to read. It can store data on the memory stick but it's not like it just shows up on the home screen so you can't just load it up with programs. And not all programs can take advantage of the extra space.You don't absolutely NEED it but if you're on a Mac I recommend you get the Mac enabling software...
1,Not that it doesn't work,"The problem is not that this product doesn't work--it's just that it only works for a few minutes. As another reviewer noted, critical components are made of cheap plastic. The paint tends to sputter very easily, and the compressor is prone to seizing up. Disassembling and soaking the various parts tends to restore matters for a small while, but the same problems tend to recur after just a few minutes of spraying. I found that on average it took about four to five times as long as a roller to paint to paint a section of wall. Consequently, I've had to ration the precious few minutes between soaks to paint hard to cover areas such as corners and vent grilles. If this product could paint reliably for even ten minutes I would have found it very useful, but the two or three minutes of effective use between soaks is not very cost effective. If you need to use a sprayer, rent a much more reliable one. No need to pay $100 or so for this white elephant."
1,Didn't Work with Panasonic Cordless Phone,I had recently purchased a Panasonic KX-TGA cordless phone and got this headset for it. People I talked with on the phone said it sounded like I was under water and that the signal was faint. I tried it on my older VTech; same problem.
