5,shades,I love em but i really wanted a green pair or white pearl frames. let me know if thoes are available. mahalos
2,Jasper pendant,"The pendant is nice; however, it's not nearly the color in the advertized photo. It's more yellowish in color. I would prefer the darker shade, since the features in the jasper seem to stand out more clearly. I was pleasantly surprised that a chain came with it. I've worn it almost incessantly since receiving it. It's a good deal for the price!"
1,There is NO car kit in the box,This product does not contain a car kit mentioned in the product description. Without this car kit GPS is useless - you cannot plug it into your PDA. Car kit sells for extra $50.

4,Good,"There is a lot to learn from this book. It kind of drags on sometimes, but overall it has a lot of really good information in it. It is also really light for a 500pg book."
4,So far so good.,I just received this and have already started reading as it will be for a fall Doctorate class. I look forward to seeing the class material that goes along with it. The author did a good job in my opinion of putting together theory from what I could tell so far. Of course I have only gotten through the first few chapters. I did notice that even though the author does make the book informative there are areas which are a bit dry but that's what I was anticipating. I'm hoping it will get a little bit better as I read into the book.
2,Only Rodeon 9700 is the fastest!,"I would not wast my money on this card, The upcoming Rodeon 9700 will easy outperform this card by 40%.And it will cost same money. The rodeon 9700 will be in stores at the end on August 2002, better wait and get the TOP NOTCH CARD!"
2,THIS CARD IS BEING REPLACED,"I bought my new computer with this card a little more than 3 months ago. Things started well until recently that my Windows XP became unstable, often restarting itself. The error message said that the card may cause this problem and asked me to download the latest driver. After I did that, the problem became worse and, my computer screen became funny with colorful dots all over the place. Finally, I called the tech support from the computer manufacture and was told that other users had experieced the similar problem. I was then instructed to uninstall the card from my computer and sent it back for a replacement. Now I am waiting for it to arrive."
3,ELITE VS. RETROMEDIA!!!!!,"The only reason to have the Elite version of this film is for the audio commentary. This is the Columbia Pictures Americanized version with English opeing titles. For watching the film, the Retromedia version is uncut as compared to the cut Elite version. The cut scene can be seen as a deleted scene, but why take a scene out of the picture and then call it a deleted scene. I don't know, unless Columbia took that scene out for their American version. The retromedia version has all the opening titles in Spanish, as it should be."
3,Make sure you're getting the right one for you!,"This isn't a formal review, as others here have said what needs to be said about this film, but be aware that Amazon has TWO listings for this title, both sporting the same reviews. THIS listing, for Fred Olan Ray's RETRO MEDIA release, does NOT contain the Jack Hill commentary. However, it DOES contain the ""deleted scene"" featured on the pricier Elite release--a smokin' hot striptease number--integrated back into the film, plus a hefty selection of trailers for Fred's breastacular films (as well as the trailer for this film) and the usual Fred & Miss Kim ""Drive-In Antics"" (and bloopers) involving silly repartee between Fred and his wife, a couple of hot dogs, and some bikini babes flashing their ta-tas out in the parking lot."
4,Healthy City,"The theme is very interesting by relating the built environment and areas of physical activities for the welfare of city residents. It is a message for city planners, citizens and public health professionals that leisure spaces are part of health conditions."
3,instructions are horrible,"The provided instructions are actually on the carrying case itself, printed in white on black. It's very difficult to tell what is what, so i didn't use them at all. Used common sense and skipped a few insert here there instructions as I had no idea what they were referring to. I ended up using bungie cords with it and it worked out fine. They really should provide useable detailed instructions."
4,Interesting book about an interesting man.,"E. Howard Hunt is one of the most bizare figures in American history. Hunt is quite candid about a number of areas, particularly with his involvment in the ""plumber's unit"" and the subsequent watergate break-ins. In other instances, such as his role in setting up the Bay of Pigs invasion, he is less candid. The biggest disappointment was the lack of any information relevent to the accusations that have been made involving him in the assassination of JFK. Nevertheless, any book about this CIA agent, bestselling novelist, WWII veteran, Watergate convict, Bay of Pigs architect, and possible JFK conspirator, is bound to be interesting."
4,More Objective & Realistic than Most,"While Minney still buys into some of the gossip and myth, his account is much more objective and realistic than those that depict Rasputin as some satanic influence. This one describes more of the real man."
4,Only one flaw,"I loved this game just like the 2003 and 2001 versions, I would hate to add up the hours spent on it. This year there is one flaw (that occured int he past two versions as well)When the game is on the line and Im down by 2, i WANT TO FOUL! But I cant. The computer does this all the time, but users cant. It is very annoying. I feel that this is the only flaw and hope that it can be fixed for 2005"
3,Just rimmed out.,"Let me start by saying that this game is a GRAND improvement from last years game. The in-the-paint action is phenominal and the level of thought in shot selection makes for a more realistic experience than you get from ESPN Basketball. However, Live's franchise mode once again isn't up to par with ESPN. After three seasons I had Paul Pierce and Trace Mcgrady starting on my bench. It's so unbelievebly easy to stack your team because the salary cap system is awfully executed.In the end, this game will WOW you on the court, and leave you scratching you head at the GM's desk.PROS- Smoothest, most realistic gameplay- Well done sound, sountrack and announcers perfectCONS- No thought in training camp mode- Salary cap ruins franchise mode- EA's comeback AI always lets the CPU score when needed."
1,Dictionary definition of narcissist,"This is a book I wouldn't ever want to read again, unless it was to wite a paper on narcissism. Even the title is kind of creepy. Please don't waste your time or money."
1,recycled Tony Robbins hooey.,"Rehashed ""I'm a big-deal-and-you-can-be-too"" mush. It reeks of false compassion. Reading it felt like having a really annoying cheer-leader chanting in my ear. The book could be reduced to a post card that says ""Dream Big Things and Do Them."" Nothing new here. Nice that two [probably one] reader[s] in LaJolla liked it; every book deserves somebody, I guess."
2,Disappointing,"Way too many unimportant composers. Far too few important musical terms, like appassionato or stringendo. Inferior, not for music teachers to use with their students."
1,Very poor kindle conversion,"I returned this pretty quickly after downloading it, citing quality issues. You can't change the font of the text, and the many illustrations are nearly illegible on a kindle. I thought it might be useful to have this information available on my kindle, but this is a case where you might as well stick with the physical book, which is relatively small and inexpensive anyway."
4,Watercolor for the first time,"Beautiful book containing great information about watercoloring. You get a lot of tips on what tools to buy, colors to use, how to use the required brushes, etc. Book also offers several to-do projects.My one objection is that projects offered throughout the book are on the difficult side - beginners need very simple paintings to gain confidence and experience."
3,Food for Thought,"""Sir Gawain"" is one of a number of stories that have come down to us from the Medieval period that one cannot help feeling has a wealth of hidden meaning behind it. The figure of the ""Green Man"" is a common although wispy character in western mythology, and his face often stares out at us from cathedral walls in Europe. The figure of Khidr in Islamic folklore, supposedly the prophet Enoch and whose very name means ""green"" in Arabic, makes one wish to find a Middle Eastern connection with this story, as there are in so much Medieval literature, such as Dante and Chaucer.The story is obviously related to the ancient myths of death and regeneration in Celtic thought as well, and fits in well with the rest of the Arthurian legends. All in all, a bit of an enigma as regards its source, and worth being aware of if you're in to that kind of thing."
1,Waste of time,I agree with the other readers. This book lacks truth. Who wouold actually believe this story was true. The ending really tests you and try not to laugh. If there was truth in this story the author killed it.
1,Made in Hollywood,The Story line in this book was manufactured to exploit thesupernatural for the motion picture industry...This will make intenseand suspenseful movie fodder. The book is full of embellishments to enhance its screen adaptations. The suspense seemed artificial and lacked credibility...
1,Confused,"I bought this book, read it and really hated it. I then bought three others which I gave as gifts. I don 't believe in ghosts and demons but a family member has had experience with her child, my niece. I gave this book to her, and one to each set of grandparents. I must inform you, as I don't feel my insight is valid being to me this book was so far fetch. The three insignts turned to 7 and each person who read this book agreed with me. There is just no way this family went through this claiming a true story. If and I repeat if it said fiction it would be exceptable. I found this book a very big disappointment, a waste of money and time. People claim this happens, weather you believe or your just reading about this ; there are much better readings. (...)I wouldn't recomend this book to anybody."
1,Supernatural?,"I am an avid reader of spiritual reading; New Age, Occult and read anything I can lay my hands on of the supernatural. This book was a disgrace to even be in these categories. Fiction written by a dreamer. There was nothing in this book proved to be a true story and the entire book was extremely boring. The plot was simple and dreamed up."
4,great camera,"yes i agree with the person below me that it does take about 5 secs to take a shot but the thing is it captured it, it just didnt show up for you to see it. HAS video. thats a plus. and well its affordable. i mean comeeee on....its a digetal camera."
5,Great pizzas,Peter Reinhart did a lot of research and testing for this book. The pies are great and I'm able to make the really thin crust pizzas my family loves with the recipes from this book. I have 3 other Peter Reinhart cookbooks and they're all winners.
1,Not many good points.,"Or should i say that there are many bad points.1. Not a great place for beginers.2. Not a great place for advanced users (or those with moderate javascript knowledge).I've had this book, as well as 2 others. This one is on the shelf and the other 2 are open on my desk. That should be enough to tell you something about it.The whole idea that you'll learn the language in 24 ""classes"" of 1 hour is dumb. But they have a ""line"" of books they want to sell, so that's what they need to do...."
3,Not for beginners,"I picked this book up early last year not knowing much about JavaScript or programming in general. Unfortunately, this book didn't help much. I remember being particulary confused when it got to arrays, and gave up. Went I went back to it half a year later after taking a C++ class, it made a lot more sense.This book is a good quick and dirty intro to JavaScript if you've already got the fundamentals of programming down. I still use it as a refernce from time to time, when I need a brush up on the basic concepts. But if you don't know much about programming, you'll probably just be confused."
2,"Little Detail, Big waste","Having been pleased with Some of Sams Teach yourself in 24 books I picked this one up. I guess JavaScript wasn't meant to be learned in 24 hours. The Author doesn't really teach it, he shows an example and then says ok now you know it. Chapter 6 Left me utterly confused.I need another resource that will lead me to the water like a baby. I understood about 70-60% of the concepts. But there was no ""Real World"" Application going on."
4,Not a bad introduction to Javascript,"I found this to be a reasonable introduction to Javascript for a newbie. While I wouldn't rely on it as a definitive source of information, it provides enough detail to give the reader the basic knowledge to read a more in depth Javascript book.It's useful as part of a Javascript library, but is by no means a library in itself."
1,Dear God! What happened to Lynn Grabhorn?,"She was such a cool voice on the new age scene. Not one of my favorites but she clearly pulled her own. How did she suddenly leave the world of believing thought creates reality and we are one with Spirit to believing in the Presiden Bush cartoon of evil doers and evil forces and an external child like belief in a separate God on a throne above the clouds. It was kind of sad to read, like reading the journal of someone having a nervous breakdown. Most people's breakdowns don't get published though. Hopefully someone close to her will reach out and help her see the beauty of who she really is and there is nothing to fear ""out there"" from the ""others"" or the ""evil doers."" Luckily, the ""others"" are just parts of us that we can work though not some boogie man force in Star Wars. Maybe she will get sober again and see that. It may be hard to realize who you are and have faith in the Divine when you are under the influence."
3,Disappointing!,"It's like she did a full circle from her first book, Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting! Initially I couldn't understand what she was talking about. It didn't make much sense. It seemed contradictory to what her first book was about. She could have presented her message a little more straightforward rather than in some cumbersome story about how God created the Universe. This book is LAME. I'm a self-help/metaphysical/new age junkie but I have to tell you...Don't waste your money or time on this book unless you get a kick out of being confused."
1,What you believe happens to you....,"...is what the author has preached to us in the past. Because she so adamantly believes in what she is writing about in this new book, it will definitely happen to her. I choose to live the principles she wrote about (and which were not original material) in Excuse Me. She claims in the new book that this has never been in print before. That is not true, as you can find this type of programming in other books. We don't need anymore scare tactics. We also don't need to think that we are so special we are going to save the world. Herein may lie the biggest problem with this book. Seems like a rather grandiose idea."
5,Amazing and Thought Provoking,"WOW! Such a different work for Lynn. I can't explain what I was thinking the first time I read this book. Awe, amazement, confusion. I just kept reading wondering what in the world she was going to say next. Once I hit the last page I started over.During the second reading I could fous on what she was saying rather than wondering what in the world was going to be on the next page. It was amazing information and I feel each person who reads her book will gain some personal insight. Take what resonates with you and leave the rest.I read it a third time so I can share with others as closely as possible the intended content. I read about 5 books every month (self help type books) and this is the ONLY book I have ever read 3 times.I can honestly say this is one of my all time favorite books.Happy reading and blessings! : )"
2,Cheesy,"My husband bought this as a replacement for a friend's that he had borrowed and then accidentally lost at a music festival. The mold is horrible and there are cracks and bumps and chips... but since it was to replace a friend's , we gave it to him."
2,Hole to big for can or bottle,The hole will hold a red solo cup but a can and a bottle go right through it. My daughter made it work by putting a thinner cozy around the can or bottle first then it fit. She didn't want to return it because she liked it.
4,Not What You Think or Who You Think!,"This is not your typical B skin flick. It has a good solid plot, decent characters, doesn't show anything you cannot see on HBO's True Blood, and has a surprise ending. I have to go back and watch this one couple more times just to catch all the twists. Not a bad movie at all."
3,Capitol of the New South,"First let me say that I really enjoy these AIA guides and this one is good. Atlanta has grown tremedously in the last twenty years and its skyline reflects that fact. This guide does not compare with the best AIA guides like the guide to Chicago, New York, Detroit, or Houston, but it hits on most of the major buildings and I liked the fact it is sectioned into different areas. I would have liked to have seen more on the Buckhead area and Druid Hills. I would have also liked to have seen every building have been accompanied by an image, that is a must in books of this kind. If you are someone from Atlanta or are interested in the architecture of Atlanta I recommend this book, but if you are just looking for AIA guides then I suggest getting the afore mentioned guides before this one."
1,I agree with Zhuge Liang,"I don't understand why they think that the average kung fu movie consumer could tolerate such crappy quality. I've seen this movie in Europe and I know for a fact that the picture quality is decent in it's widescreen format. When I seen this one come to the states, I refused to buy it unless there was some indication that it's either remastered or in letterbox or both. They should start doing decent transfers of kung fu movies and quit ripping us kung fu movie fans off!!"
1,Delonghi DCU62 Deluxe 60 Cup Coffee Urn quit working.,"The coffee urn is less than 2 years old and has been used less than 2 dozen times. In contrast, my Farberware 55-cup urn is 20 years old, has been used over 200 times, and is still going strong.)The urn heats, but only perks for about 1/3 as long as necessary to make coffee. The red power light stays on, but the green lights never come on.I can't find any information on-line on how to get the thing repaired, and there is no information on the box. Needless to say, I think that it is a piece of junk."
2,"I hate writing bad rewiews, but..............","With the exception of Patrica Potter story, I really hated this book. To say this book was dry and not engaging is an understatement."
4,It was a good read,"I just finished reading this book and I thought it was good. I LOVE Lynn Kurland, so that's why I even got the book. The Bachelor Knight was sort of boring, it took me a while to read through that. My favorite one of course was The Traveller. All in all I would recommend this book to a friend."
3,Starting to get old,It is still fun to watch but the whole American Pie thing is just getting old and stale... I can tell you right now what the next 3 will be like. (I bet you can also)
3,Bringing back the old gang...that's it.,Nice to see the entire original cast come back together for one last hooray but didn't really have anything worth watching it again.
3,Just ok.,"If you've seen the previous American Pie movies, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. If not, start with the first one, its the best."
2,typical sequel,"American Pie (Unrated)As with all other sequels to American Pie, it just doesn't measure up to the original."
5,Funny!!,"We loved it!! If you loved American Pie, than you are going to love this one as well. Much better than the dissappointing 2nd movie."
5,fun movie,It was great to see where these charactors ended up after all of these years. If you liked the first 3 instsllments you will like this one.
3,Its okay,"I'm not a big fan of the series,but it was just as raunchy as the first two movies.I like seeing them grow up."
3,"""A Sentimental Raunchfest""","A pretty funny depiction of sentimentality, scatology and bacchanal sexualtity. The characters are generally sympathetic, despite their tempestuous behavior and the plot itself is tangentially believable. Plus, you get to see naked organs and whatnot Seriously... Eugene Levy with his deadpan acting, as always, makes this thing work and I look forward to seeing him perform again in the very near future."
4,New version being shipped.,"Received this copy and was concerned as the version I got no longer has the slipcase which states it provides the Itunes Digital Copy + Ultraviolet. I called Amazon back regarding this and was informed that it did include the digital versions. Removed the shrink wrap and discovered the codes inside. So while it shows digital copy on the page and the blu-ray case no longer does, you are still provided with one. Don't stress like I did when you receive it."
2,a reunion not to watch,This was just a bad movie not Worth buying just plane bad the first was the best this one was just plane bad don't wast your money.
4,It was good.,Pretty funny movie. It was nice to see a fresh movie with most of the same faces. We enjoyed it. Same old cheesy comedy.
1,Pure Junk.,"This book covers less about servlets than you could find in one or two issues of any monthly java periodical, and what it does present is shaky and amatuerish at best. I only wish I had seen these reviews before purchasing it at my local bookstore. What a waste. The author should be held accountable for this garbage, as well as the publisher."
1,example do not work,"Some of example does not have complete source codes. Also, do not expect get any help from author¡s forum because almost nobody gets a response from the author since Feb 2000. Good Luck; you really need one!"
1,"Better named ""Java Servlets by trivial examples""",The example code given in the book is very trivial and a disappointment for a person who gets carried away by its title.The book is for beginners who want to understand what a servlet is and who does not care to see if the examples work. First of all the examples are very superficial and most of them need to be debugged if you have to run them.
2,not so grand...,"First, let me say - I really wanted to LOVE this album. Not just like - love, people. I've seen Erin several times, every chance I can get. I have never been disappointed, even when she was playing the material from the album Grand. She is still a fantastic singer/songwriter/performer.BUT, this album has left a hole... I hate to pigeonhole her and ask that she stay true to her original form on the first two albums... However, this album didn't feel like it was so much her anymore. A lot has to do with the band, but the melodies were much more Popish with only an inkling every once in a while of original style.Lyrics are still good and her singing has never been better.I'm sorry Erin, I won't give up seeing you and buying your cds, but I hope you will reclaim a bit of what is yours."
4,A sign of things to come,"What a strong debut. If you like this one, be sure to pick up Moxie Bravo and Get The Guests, which show them living up to (and exceeding) the promise of this catchy debut."
2,A Dreadful Translation,"This, the most famous of novellas (ostensibly ased on the death of Mahler), is given very poor treatment here; the wording, however, accurate, is clunky and graceless; while the price is agreeable the Thomas Mann is not; David Luke's version, in a Bantam paperback, is far sweeter, far more readable and should appeal to anyone named Dena from Toronto."
1,Homo-pedophile Stalker in Venice,"I had to read this for a literature course. In the beginning of the story, Mann provides some great insight into the creative process of art. Unfortunately, the main plot is about an older man's homo-erotic fantasies while he stalks an adolescent boy. I can only guess how anyone would find pleasure or catharsis from reading this. I found nothing interesting or provocative of thought in the latter two-thirds of this piece of work. Furthermore, I find the notion of romanticizing or intellectually exhalting the theme of this story to be a bit disturbing."
2,Much less to this than I had supposed,"There is an old review of mine in this page that praises _Death in Venice_ as ""one of the greatest works of short fiction ever written."" After seeing Visconti's film adaptation I realized that I had been quite wrong. _Death in Venice_ is actually a rather slight story of homosexual infatuation made to look like it has the gravity of the ages by Mann's skill at ellipsis. But the movie is forced to make it all explicit, revealing that the Reason vs. Emotion debate is in fact rather hackneyed, and that the ""voluptuousness of doom"" Mann speaks of is just an older man's obsession with a pretty little boy. My hat goes off to Mann as a stylist, but I am ashamed I was taken in by this."
1,The most boring piece of literature that I've ever read,"It's boring, it's stupid, it's perverted, it's slow, it's TOO descriptive.Don't waste your time, there are many deep and interesting books in Amazon as to read this one."
1,Zero stars if I could,"I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book. But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me. I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them. I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore. Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...)."
2,ugh! and more ugh!,"I got this as a gift and was initially delighted. It looked like it was very well-made and sturdy. It was hard to open and close at first, but seemed OK after a few tries.However, my delight soon turned to despair. The mesh ripped the first time I used it. And, no matter how hard I pulled, tugged, and twisted, I couldn't get the ball apart to take out the used tea leaves. Then, the chain broke.I finally called Amazon, and they refunded the cost immediately. The tea ball went straight into the garbage.Now what?"
1,Poor locking design,"I was very disappointed with this teaball. It is not readily apparent from the picture but this product is actually shaped like a small cylinder, 3cm high with ~ a 6cm diameter. The cylinder twists apart in the middle to open. The problem is that first of all it is not tall enough to grasp firmly and has no 'handle' points, and second the actual locking mechanism is simply based on a push and twist design, but the metal parts do not fit together properly and are very hard to twist. Wrenching the teaball seems a good way to get tea all over the floor.In fact, this first day I received the teaball I practiced opening it several times and eventually it became stuck, I was unable to open it until the next morning. Even if my particular product was somehow bent I cannot see how this mechanism could hold up to repeated use.Hopefully Amazon will have another teaball soon."
2,Didn't work well,"I tried three of these in different sizes for my HED wheel and could never get the seal between the extender and my valve to work well. You can not tighten these hard enough to get a good seal or they strip the threads. I ended up buying extenders where you could take out the core and put it into the extender. They work great; as long as your tube has a removeable core, I would recommend this approach."
5,Awesome,"Any S Club fan will love this movie. I'm an S Club fan so this is my favorite! There's tons of funny scenes. S Club fans, you won't be disapointed."
3,"Its not bad, but not all that great, either.","I bought this to have something to listen to on the way to church on Sunday. I really love Josh Turner and Allison Kraus, the rest I could take or leave."
4,A Must For All Sailor Mercury Fans!,"I have had this book for about a month. I love it! The pictures are great! There are only a few mistakes I have seen. Plus, it is hard on the eyes turning the book around and around to read it. But that does not make it bad. I still love this book! It is a must for any Sailor Mercury fan! I would highly recommend it!"
5,Not for the average child.,"I was given this book a few years ago by my grandfather; my grandparents knew that I liked origami, electronics, and legos. It's an incredible book; I spent long hours folding airplane after airplane. My school administrators (the philistines) lumped artwork such as the AWACS with any other form of flying paper, and this caused much strife. This is a wonderful book; an ideal gift for anyone from a child of 10 who knows some origami to a college student. Having lost my copy years ago, I'm only replacing it now, but I treasure this gift more than any video game or radio-controlled car."
2,Not the greatest DVD I have ever purchased,"After viewing and working out with this DVD, I have to agree with the other reviews that were written. Her cueing is hard to follow and the camera angles leave a lot to be desired. I was able to complete the workout in its entirety with 3# weights but would not be able to perform this workout 4 - 6 times per week as she suggests because I would be tired of it after two workouts."
4,Watching Pole Dance,"I like this DVD and I think it's a good workout. But it's frustrating because she often seems like she's up there doing her own free flow dance - much of it kind of stripper-like - without saying anything about changing sides or that she's going onto a new exercise. I mean she offers hardly ANY direction. You're just supposed to watch her do her thing and join in if you can. But it does feel like a good workout. I've just done it a few times but I feel more pulled in, more tight."
2,Lacks meaningful instruction,"I'm disappointed with this video. Because of the price, I read a ton of reviews, and I guess I failed to take seriously the ones saying that she did not provide adequate instruction (instead she seems to be quite enamored of her own dance skills). It's very hard to follow her moves because she rarely provides a cue, switching from one move to the next - and back - with nothing but her own dancing to indicate it. So, you must keep your eyes glued to the screen until you've basically memorized the routines. Perhaps if you have a dance background this will be totally fine with you, but my background is pilates/yoga, not dance, and I found it frustrating. I've just ordered The Complete Physique 57 Workout Kit 3 Disc Set With Ball and Pump with the hope that it will be more engaging."
4,It works!,"I have been using this 5 days a week and am seeing results! I can't believe it.I also had the same problems as Tracy. I too am 5 foot tall and it seemed that no matter how I worked out, I would bulk up and create problem areas instead of slimming down. This method works. I also have cut out bread and cheese and am doing cardio work. I lost 7 pounds very quickly! I feel fantastic and am happy that I am on the path to slimmer arms, waist and hips. Thank you!"
1,Worst DVD ever!,It's all about her. If your eyes are not constantly on Tracy you cannot listen to know what to do next. She goes from one move to the next without saying a word. She does not give any instruction. It's her exercising and you watching. Speak up Tracy! There are sooo many better exercise DVD's out there. Don't waste your time with this one.
5,"I wasn't sure at first, but I love this workout now!","I love this workout now, but it wasn't love at first sight! The first time I tried it, I wasn't sure I liked it at all. It has a weirdly sensuous vibe (my husband calls it the pole-dancing video) and is hard to follow at first. It isn't cued all that well, and I wasn't always sure that I was doing it right. (especially the standing abs section!) It definitely takes some getting used to. I highly recommend doing the routine in front of a large mirror, so that you can watch what you're doing and make adjustments. That helped me a lot! I liked this more and more each time I did the routine and now it is my favorite. After just a few weeks I can definitely tell a difference in my body. Even more importantly, I really enjoy it and look forward to doing it! I am doing it 4-5 times a week and love the way it makes me feel."
5,Best Workout Ever!!!,I'm seeing results that I have never seen before! It is challenging and totally worth it! I can't wait to try the aerobics dvd!
3,Minimal instruction,"First let me say that I do like the workout. But I have to add that for the price, it is very unprofessional.I like the workout as it is different and is easy on my knees. It is more like ballet and pilates, so it is a gentle workout, but not easy. It is just that Tracy is difficult to follow because she does not instruct very well.What I found most frustrating is that she is not consistant with reps. She will do 25 on the right and 39 on the left for the same excersize! Do that for a while and you will see the difference and that is not easy to fix!I have watched with pen in hand and wrote out the reps for each side and now do the workout without Tracy! Of course, I do the same amount of reps for each excersize on both sides, but really, for 29.00+ I should NOT have to do that!So, if you do buy this video, know that you will have to pay attention to this if you expect your results to be even for both legs."
1,Okay..um...yeah,"I purchased this DVD based on the fact that there were so many positive reviews, however, I should have done what I normally do and that is...go directly to the negative reviews. I was expecting to be sore the next day as the DVD promised and I was not. The music is horrible. the moves are really sexual and weird. I don't agree with some of her methods, for instance she talks against having any type of muscular tone and instead promotes just being skinny. What is the point of having a flat stomach without muscle tone? Having muscles, does not equate to looking like a man. Just look at Jillian Michaels, Michelle Dozois, and Amy Bento just to name a few. By the way, any of these women have great workouts that burn fat, strengthen, and tone. You need the balance."
3,"Lots of Repetition, Not variety like in Yoga","As a yoga and dance student, though I like the gracefulness of Anderson's moves, I do find the many repetitions of movements boring and not stimulating, especially for my mind."
4,Jennifer,I just purchased this dvd about a week ago and I have to agree that it really is a great unique workout. I have been able to get through most of the exercises without stopping. For some strange reason I am not sore at all.I have also ordered the dance dvd which should be pretty interesting considering I am not a dancer at all!!Once I try it out for a week or so I will report back.I would Google Tracy Anderson and check out some of the webisodes online if you are still not sure about her method.Very good info out there!!
3,You'll need your own music,"I like this workout, but the music is awful. After I had done it once or twice I felt comfortable enough with the moves to turn the DVD volume down really low and put on my own music, which improved the experience of this workout tremendously. Tracy doesn't talk much, ( I don't think she elaborates enough, really, as to correct position of each move; and she doesn't count down the reps or anything) so you don't really need the sound. My favorite sections are the arms and abs - I wasn't familiar with the moves in these sections and both gave me sore muscles the next day ( which is rare at this point, I have a lot of workout DVDs)"
5,Tracy Anderson mat workout,"This DVD is great I tried it for the first time today and I can see it's totally different from other methods I tried, I feel good about it and I know I won't stop this time. It's energetic and makes me want to continue even after one hour.Bravo.MC"
3,"If you live in Canada, think again.","No questions asked, THE WORST shipping time ever. I had time (and would have got a good workout) to walk across North America to California to pick it up. Also the value of the DVD was inflated on the customs order form, so the duty I paid on delivery was ridiculous. All told, this cost me $75."
2,Mat Workout DVD: She needs to give more direction,"Maybe this is her first workout video, but she moves pretty quickly and expects you to follow her without any verbal direction. I have no doubt it will get me in shape, but I'm disappointed in her presentation."
2,Not a Mat Workout,"I am just starting to get back into shape after a foot injury. I was excited to see that Tracy Anderson has a ""Mat"" workout as I cannot stand and weight bear for long periods of time. This DVD disappointed me as most all of it is done standing up, weight bearing on the feet. Looks like an awesome workout, hope to be able to do it some day. But to call this a ""Mat"" workout is a serious misrepresentation of what it's about. From watching it I would give it a five as a workout... but I'm being generous giving it a two star because it does not deliver what the title says. Love Tracy Anderson... wish it really was a mat workout."
5,The Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout,"Love, Love, Love this product. Awesome results from this work out right away. Can't say enough about it except buy it!!!!!"
3,"Nice fitness concept, poor instruction","I completely support this method of fitness... Working smaller muscle groups to support joints and prevent injuries. However, Tracy leads the DVD with very limited instruction and just gets into her own dance zen mode. Kind of weird. I personally do not like to look at the screen during my workouts. I prefer to maintain proper form and spinal alignment and depend on auditory cues often. Even after previewing this first, it is difficult to follow since she does not cue much at all. The video seems long and drab. I prefer Ellen Barrett for this style fitness training. She has impeccable cuing and her DVDs are very fluid and go by quickly leaving you feeling stretched, strengthened and energized. But if you like repetitive motions (major burn) while looking at the instructor, Tracy will be fine for you. There is no denying that doing this workout will tone you. But it just won't be fun."
3,Okay but some weird moves,"I do not have a dance background but I love yoga and pilates. Tracy has a dance background and is probably a great trainer 1:1 but she is a lame teacher. She is hard to follow. She gives very few instructions then changes up the moves without telling you. She does some weird moves. I wish that the DVD was broken down into chapters like arms, stomach, legs etc. I have to fast forward the parts I don't like."
3,Better than the cardio dance workout,"This workout is a nice break from the traditional core or ab routines. It is way more dance focused for a lean, non-bulky shape. I find the music to be fun and different and I enjoy the standing ab routine. However, Tracy takes for granted that many of the people who may be trying her video are novices and she doesn't call out what she is doing or count reps etc. It's basically a routine where you watch her and mimic what she is doing. So, for those of you who are familiar with Kathy Smith or Denise Austin, this may be difficult for you to follow."
2,Tracy Anderson Review,"boring. so artsy, none of the stuff i've read about her workouts were represented here."
2,I wanted to love it but...,"I think Tracy Anderson is fantastic and has really done well transforming celebrity bodies. However, I don't think her at home workouts can bring the same results.First of all, she does the routines unevenly and out of sequence. And secondly she doesn't even describe the movements or what to focus on as she does the movements. All in all, very disappointing."
3,Difficult to follow,I've been working out over 25 years with and without video. This video was much to hard to follow.
4,LOOOOOVE IT!!!!,I love this workout. I really feel it working my body and toning it. My only complaint is that she does not give hardly any direction througout the video. It would be great during the ribs and abs segment. Other than that it's great.
2,gave me knee pain,This work out is not for anyone with hyper flexabity in their joints. My knees started hurting after a week of doing the workout every other day. My knees now make crunching noises and are swollen - I feel like an 80 year old woman.
4,Tracy rocks!!,"This DVD is amazing! I am familiar with Tracy Anderson as I used her post pregnancy DVD so I knew what I was getting into. This DVD is so much better than the post pregnancy! She is more engaging, and this is a really great overall workout. Yes, it's challenging, but the results are so worth it. There are a few times where Tracy could give more direction (abs section), but if you watch her, you'll catch on. I do this workout 1-2 times a week, and have seen (and feel) improvements. I'd probably be a superstar if I did the workout 5 times a week as recommended. GREAT workout!!"
1,Tracy Anderson Method: Mat Workout,"The dvd was what I expected from reading the other reviews prior to purchasing. I expected it to be dancey and little instruction. However, I was hoping to get something out of it, but found it really boring and uninspiring....almost like Tracy Anderson was just going through the motions in her mind....instruction was poor. Her moves are not challenging, so, no need to be intimidated, but cueing needs to occur. I could not even finish it...I found it that mundane and have not looked at it again."
5,The workout video everyone should own.,"I was amazed at how well this video is put together for the best workout I have ever had in my life. I like to exercise, swim, run and moutain bike riding. I thought those three forms were a good workout and that all of my muscles were being worked. But when I did this exercise video, I feel that it was better than anything I have ever tried. You only need a chair and 2 (3lb weights). The price is a bargain, for a personal workout trainer. I have reccomended this video to everyone I know. It is amazing and I am so thankful Tracy Anderson is sharing her techniques to us that cannot afford or have the oppurtunity to get an expert workout trainer."
1,might have all the info but,This book might have all the info that Greek Grammar for Colleges is supposed to have but the printing/photocopying? makes the greek text illegible.
2,El Paso Boys band,"OK, maybe I shouldn't try to review this as I'm not really a music critic. But the group was popular in Germany."
2,"Predictable poorly written, Shadowrun limit the # authors!","It is sad that Shadowrun seems to let anyone interested in writing a book, do it for them. Probably the worst in what has of late become a declining series set in a great environment."
2,Good idea - poor performance!,"This novel is for people who like cartoons, the people in it act like it, they are genuine cartoon characters. While there is nothing wrong with that at all and this kind of writing sometimes guarantees relaxing entertainment, the action in this book is very often delayed by lenghty background information that does not serve any purpose, and by endless dialogues. Either we want a cartoon-like book with fast cartoon-like action or a normal sf- or fantasy novel. You cannot have both."
3,Not too impressed,A decent enough book if you're a beginner Windows user looking to set up a LAN. Otherwise too superficial and Windows-oriented.
5,Works like a charm,I have a Nintendo DS Lite that had a lost AC adapter--this replacement works like a charm.
5,Good item,Got a good item at great price. Got here on timeWell packaged. Works great with no problem.good buy for the price
3,Not universal voltage,"The description says, ""World traveler (100-240V). The innovative travel charger automatically adjusts to all voltages and frequencies in the U.S., Europe, and Asia,"" but in fact this power adapter only works with US voltage (110V). If you do plug into 240V you'll let the magic smoke out."
3,Where's the box you show?,"I can't complain that it doesn't work. It works great. However, don't show a nice box -- appearing to display a new in box item -- and then ship just the cord throwin into a manilla envelope. If this were purchased as a gift, I would have been very upset. Fortunately, this was just a handed replacement to my son and he didn't care what it looked like."
1,***Fake Cable***,This cable is a fake dual link DVI cable. Although it looks like the correct fitting the cable itself is too narrow for a Dual link cable and dose not support 2560x1600 resolution. Since its only $4 it isn't worth returning..... Should have known better!!! Don't waste your time!!!
1,"Fake, not ""dual link"", doesn't support 2560x1600 (or 1440)","The extra pins are fake and not really active, it's a single link cable with dual link connectors. Get Tripp Lite cable instead, it's real Dual Link and supports 2560x1600"
5,Great Product,We love this product! It has kept our 21 month old son from getting in the fridge and it automatically locks when the door shuts so you don't have to remember each time.
4,Good product; Works for me!!,Easy intallation and it stuck to the refrigerator well and did it's job of keeping my 2 year old son out the refrigerator.
3,good for a few days,it worked well until it was opened numerous times unknowing it was there by various different people until it just kept on falling off
2,Toddler Too Smart,"I have a 2 y/o in which I purchase this product for to keep him out of the fridge. I expected it to keep him out of the fridge, but he watched me open it with this product one time, and he figured it out. It did, however, slow him down from opening the fridge which gave me more time to catch him and stop him. I accidently bent the part that's attached to the actual fridge and it wouldn't bend back to be used. So I just pulled the entire thing off. I only had it for about a month. I wouldn't recommend this for those who have VERY smart toddlers. I will continue my search for another product to keep my son out of the fridge for his health (literally) and safety."
1,Leave it to a professional!,"I had one stubborn blackhead at the corner of my lip that compelled me to order this. It did work remarkably well on that blackhead, but then I couldn't leave well enough alone. I must have messed up my pores, because now for the first time IN MY LIFE (I'm 29), I have acne on my chin. The chin is the only place I used this tool (other than that initial blackhead) and now it's one problem after another. Not just whiteheads either, cysts that are inflammed and itchy! The only thing that I've done differently with my skin routine is use this, and it's caused me nothing but problems. Leave the pore unclogging to a professional; you're opening up quite a can of worms if you take this upon yourself."
1,Loop style does not work for me...consider the spoon style.,"These blemish extractors come in at least two styles: a wire loop like this one, and a style where the end looks like a small spoon with a hole in the bottom. For me, the spoon style works and the loop style does not. The loop exerts pressure on only three sides of the blemish and allows the pressure to escape towards the fourth side, and that reduction in pressure keeps the blemish from being forced to pop. The spoon style puts pressure on all four sides and works for me."
3,"Not totally accurate, could have caused some major problems.",The book does not have totally accurate information. example: a Cessna Citation 550 nose gear can only be turned up to 90 degrees. In the book they wrote it can be turned 360 degrees. With new Linemen using this book as a reference it could have cause a broken nose gear.
3,Nice quality watch case but arrived in damaged condition,"I ordered this watch storage chest as a gift. When it arrived, I was pleased to see that it came in a nice lidded gift box nestled in plenty of peanut cushioning and with additional cushioning inside the box. Despite this, however, the item was damaged in several places: the latch was broken, one corner of the box was crushed in, and there were several scratches. Given that the item was so well-packaged, it seems likely that the damage occurred PRIOR TO shipping, which suggests to me that the item was not adequately examined by the merchant. Otherwise, the box did appear to be of good quality, at least in terms of the wood and the nicely-lined interior (the latch itself seemed rather cheap). However, based on this experience, I have requested a refund rather than a replacement, as I plan to look elsewhere for both a better product and a better merchant."
3,About the only book on the subject,It was prepared by the Churchill Lady's Club. There was a second edition (not much changed) in 2006.
1,Eco Pad does not work with Black & Decker Home Cafe,"I don't know why, however the Eco Pad did not work with my Black & Decker Home Cafe. My machine has only been used a few times, I followed the Eco Pad directions to a ""T"" and all I get is coffee that looks like mud and tastes like I am eating coffee grounds. Now, after I tried to go back to using the pre-filled pods you purchase at the grocery store, I am still getting coffee that tastes like I am eating the grounds."
5,Excellent product more beautiful than described A++++,The pajamas from Vanity Fair are excellent and so beautiful. They are my favorite of all pajamas. They are exquisite and lovelier than I ever thought possible. I just absolutely love them.
4,Very comfortable!,"The pajamas are very comfortable! The material is soft, though it is thin. I will be comfy while wearing them!"
3,PAJAMA,THERE NICE BUT VERY THIN ALMOST SEE THROUGH BUT NICE. I'LL KEEP THEM BECAUSE I DON'T WHERE THEM VERY OFTEN.
5,Super PJs,True to size & and also pretty pjs. Just the right length in both legs & sleeves. The elasticized waist has just enough give to be comfortable all night long. These are well made pjs & hold up to lots of wear & journeys through the washer & dryer. The color azure stays the same forever.....no fading. Vanity Fair sleepwear is always a good buy.
1,Outdated filming and fighting technologies. One of the worst kung fu movies I've ever seen.,"The filming and fighting styles are extremely outdated. They look exactly like those of Hong kong movies made during the 1970's and 80's. I mean they're slow and look fake. There is no plot just fighting from the beginning till the end. The costumes and make-up also look like those in 70's movies.Yuen biao's acting and fighting skills are so disappointing here.In short, this movie is boring and repetitive. It's a huge waste of money and time. It's one of the worst kung fu movies I've ever seen."
4,Good,All the DVDs were in good condition and they all worked. I'm a big fan of this show and would also like to get other seasons...good bang for your price.
3,not the greatest,"Used the watch many times for diving, max depth 110'; never any water leakage problem. Visibe underwater, nice looking on dry land.Problems: 1) the rubber wristband is an instrument of torture. I hate it. It pinches! This is no doubt true for all watches with thick rubber wristbands, but this is the one I happen to have purchased. Won't ever get this type of band again--instead, leather (for dry land) or metal (for diving). It is not possible to replace the band with a metal one--wrong size or something (as explained to me by three different watch places). 2) after about a year, the date-adjust shortcut broke--that is, where you can adjust the date directly by pulling the stem out halfway. So, I've had to adjust the date by going all the way around, 24 hours per day! 3) after 5 years, it has now stopped keeping any semblance of accurate time (and the battery was already replaced).So, not a disaster for $150, but not the greatest. I'll try another Citizen's, but with a metal band."
1,"save your money, buy a $10 walmart special","I've had this watch 2 1/2 years. it's been back for repair 4 times. The only good thing was the J&R; jeweler's warranty. First the metal band broke after a year. I could live with that but 20 months it started to loose time. I put up with this for a couple of months. Than it would stop running. The manual claims it will run for 6 months after full charge. I charged it according to the manual, stopped after two weeks. Took it to J&R; they sent it back. Waited 6 weeks got it back, nothing was fixed.Sent back 3 more times(a month wait each time) and still has not been fixed. The $10 walmart special I bought as backup keeps better time and when it stops, for $10 a new watch. Save your $200 don't buy this watch."
3,Good heater,"It was on clearance at walmart.com and the price was CHEAP.This heater has most features of Lasko Pedestal Heater except this heater is not as tall (not 30.91"" but around 20"") but it is made with stainless steel and can be used horizontally. Another difference is that temperature is preset at settings of 65, 70, 75 or 80 degrees.1500-Watt WindChaser CER95R produces heat pretty well but the temperature control does not function very well. When set at 65-degrees, WindChaser CER95R did stop (idk the actual temperature since there is no display) but it would not turn back on even the temperature drops way below 65 degrees (I checked and it was 60 degrees). I had to change the setting to 75-degree for the heater to start working again."
1,Disappointing,"My 10 -year-old was very excited to get a telescope, but he says he can see things in the sky better with his naked eye than with the scope. Maybe he just hasn't figured out how to adjust it properly, but he's disgusted with it."
3,How Bizzare!,Strange foods from around the world. It is probably a blue print for the Food Network TV show.
3,Cute but small,Please note before buying this that it is about 1'x2' in size. My son loves it but we needed to suppliment tub bottom coverage so he would not slip. It does not cover the bottom of a bathtub.
1,"This hardcover is a tiny, abridged version of the book","Amazon continues to list this book as a hardcover; the only hardcover is a 160 or 190 page excerpt (depending on the edition) of Marx's Grundrisse, which is around 900 pages of material. I simply don't want others to continue ordering this not knowing what they're getting. It happened to me, and I was not pleased. This hardcover is the David McLellan excerpt, published around 1970. There appears to be no hardcover edition of the Grundrisse available anywhere."
2,They would not work,"I bought 2 of these for my kids, neither of them would be reconized by my pc to load songs on. I had origianaly thought it was my pc but I have 2 Dell Dj's, 2 Creative Zens and 1 crappy 256k Audiovox Mp3 player which all work fine. I contacted Sandisk customer support through thier website. They were quick to respond, friendly with very good instructions through several back and forth emails so I give them an ""A"" for effort there. However nothing they suggested for me to try would get these to work.Maybe it was my pc ? But I doubt that was the case."
5,Forget ipod (and the big money); Sandisk makes a great mp3 player,"I feel like the only person in the world without a ""real"" ipod, but quite frankly, I feel like the Sandisk gives me everything I need at a fraction of the price. This is the 3rd model I've bought (I had the 1/2 gig, the 1 gig, now I'm up to the 2 gig). I think I have about 300 songs on my current model.... loading the player is really easy (I use Windows Media Player), and the navigation on the player is a scinch. And it takes ""normal"" AAA batteries (alkaline or rechargeables). If you're considering the ipod shuffle, you should seriously consider this model instead.... it gives you a lot more features for a fraction of the price.My only suggestion is that Sandisk always include white earbuds instead of black ones, regardless of the color of the player itself (they did on the last 2 models, but not on this most recent one). Black earbuds look dated."
4,best pick,"I bought this unit a few yrs ago and am not sorry that i did , its performance is the greatest. I use this for exercise, gardening and other chores, the armband makes it nice to do all that with. I have used the unit so much that i have to invest in a new one. I have friends that have other mp3 players and they dont hold up to this one. exceptional value"
4,I've used this product for some time now,"I've used this product for some time now and it works well for what I use it for. The only thing I wish it would do is not lose it's memory each time the power is taken off it, like the equalizer setting or it's current play track as an example."
1,Dead on Arrival,I was looking for a cheap Mp3 player for a friend traveling to a high theft area. This product seemed perfect until it arrived. My friend brought it back to me immediately stating that it never worked right out of the packaging. I looked at it myself and could do nothing to make it work. I threw it away... not even worth the trouble of returning!!!!!Don't buy !
3,It's Just Okay,"I needed to replace a MP3 player and found this one. It works well and holds a lot of music. The FM works well also. Two things I don't like about it, first, it won't hold an SD media card. Second, it is not easy to set the order of the songs once they have been transferred into it. Their website (SANDISK) is not easy to navigate to find instructions on how to accomplish this task. Good points are that it takes an AAA battery, found all over the world, and has plenty of power to drive headphones."
4,Good little player---except,I love this little mp3 player. It is easy to use. The only thing I would change is that I would have liked a rechargeable battery.
2,sandisk sdmx3-2048,one of them works great but the other one has stop working and we would like to find out how to get it replaced or are money back thank youSanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black)
3,Not user-friendly,"I brought this device because it is one of the few AAA battary MP3 player.Pros: good sound quality. Lcd is bright to me. Button is esay to touch.Cons: not users friendly1. its ""smart"" arrangement of songs irratates me. Every time after I dis connect from PC, it re-arrange all the songs even if I have groupped them in different folders.2. Can not delete songs on the devise. REALLY BAD.3. Some translation causes misunderstanding. ""Power-off"" in Chinese is translated into ""Battary down"".(Silly)4. Poor bookmark function. If you connect to your PC, you can not hear where you stopped last time. And this is the same after you listen to radio."
5,LOVE IT,"Price is super good. Sound quality the best from all my other (brands) mp3 players. It has all the features one is looking for, very easy to download music and play and I love the fact that I can use AAA batteries.I have a couple of other much more expensive mp3 players but this one is my favorite one and the most used one I prefer. Very lightweight, good looking and easy to tuck into your bag or even pants pockets. Overall, I couldn't be happier and highly recommend the player."
2,Too Many Flaws,"I bought this as a gift for my wife a year and a half ago. We had to get the original replaced because it kept resetting itself and deleting all of the files on it. When it was not doing that it was freezing up.The second one has avoided the resetting and my wife has had it for about a year now. The problem it has is there are some .mp3 files that it just does not want to play. Those same files work on other mp3 players, Palms, and computers we have without a problem. We have deleted them off the device and tried again and the same tracks still do not want to play.I bought myself a Creative Zen V Plus about a year ago. My wife tells me that I bought her the cheap piece of junk and got myself the good mp3 player. I may give my mp3 player to her or get her a decent one."
4,This is my favorite MP3 player,This is a great little MP3 player. I've had 3 of them so far. The first one got wet and wouldn't come back on...my fault..the second on flew out of my pocket when I riding a motorcycle. My third one is great. I use it everyday.The user functions of this MP3 player is easy to use. This is not an Ipod touch...basic..very basic but it has great sound and they are bulletproof...except water and sweat..be carefulI give this product 4 stars...the only reason I won't give it 5 is because all three of these MP3 players has a fault. They will lock up from time to time. I have no idea what causes it but they all do it. I've upgrade the firmware on all three of them and they all continued to do the same thing. Not a big deal to me.I simply turn it off and back on and keep rocking. Hey for 20 bucks..I don't care..the quality of music is great and I don't have to worry about my kids taking it.
1,Piece o' Junk,"I initially over looked its cheap construction, bulky size, uncomfortably small strap, and laughable ""raincoat"" as ""getting what you pay for"" until its memory just corrupted its self after less than a month of use. Pay a couple bucks more for something halfway decent like a Creative or iPod like I should have."
4,great low cost MP3 player,"I have two of these players and have purchased two as gifts. I was surprised at the sound quality for the price. It does not have a color screen or fancy do dads. What it does have is an easy to use interface and plenty of extra features like an equalizer, FM radio, and customizable settings.The only downside is the durability of the housing. This will not stand up to much abuse. I've had mine for a year + now though and have not had any trouble.The major deciding factor for my purchase (besides price) was that it is powered by a AA battery. These are easy to buy, carry and change out. I did not want a player that had to be charged at a computer or special dock. I have been very happy with this player."
2,Great--if it works,"I have an M250 that has worked well since October, but for a friend I got one that was defective (fast forward and fast reverse wouldn't work) and then another that was also defective (permanently frozen on the start screen). The SanDisk technicians made good efforts to correctr the problems over the phone but gave up. Amazon was great about returns within the 30 day period, by the way."
1,Sandisk.......lame,"This is a cheap player and im not talking about price. The quality of these players has gone down and wasen't very high to start with so beware of what you are buying. Is it cheeper to buy this and have it die within a day/month or just get an IPOD/Zune that will last you years and has awesome customer support. I will go with IPOD/Zune. This player is finally what drove me into getting an IPOD. I lost my music to many times to poorly designed, low quality players, enough is enough. All the problems listed here are the same problems I have experienced with this and nearly every sandisk player. It takes forever to copy songs, freezes, battary may charge when you plug it in or it may flake out within seconds after saying it's charged and you unplug it, it says songs are copied when they are not, the play order of songs is retarded, the controls are cheap and unresponcive, and this device is over all just garbage. AVOID!"
3,a good player until they die for no reason,"We've had three of these players in different memory sizes over the yrs. I really want to like them because they're great players, especially for the $, but only when they decide to work- they are definitely NOT reliable. The ~5 yr old original 512mb one we have is still going although it will occasionally get flakey and not fire up unless you remove the batteries and then you can put the same back in and it'll work. And then it will sometimes have no sound output and fix itself after a few minutes (it's not the earbuds). I had a 1gb one that, for no reason, died after about a month of use- it wasn't dropped. It will turn on but it will not allow you to see it via PC and it will not play- just fires up and ""idles"". The latest, a 2gb, has music loaded, and plays, but it will no longer let you see it via PC to add more songs. It is not full.In short, this could be a great player, especially for the $, but they definitely have major hardware issues."
4,Meets all of my expectations,"It is my second sandisk mp3 player. It works well, sounds good, good battery life."
2,Good construction but terrible software,"I bought the M250 with 2 GB memory recently. It is a nicely built unit but the interface is the worst I have ever come across. The software/firmware has a mind of its own and move your files to what ever folders it thinks the music or podcast belongs. It will break up the tracks from one CD and put them all over the place. Who in Sandisk thinks that they should decide where I should put my musics and how to organize my files. What a piece of junk as far as the software is concerned. Please read other reviews and comments. I should have read all reviews and negative comments before I made my purchase. Sandisk must change the software/firmware. From all the reviews I have read, I don't think they care."
3,2 defective M250s in two weeks,I recently got one that would not keep the place when turning off or pausing. I returned it to Amazon and got another. Same problem developed within a few days of use. I have an M250 that I bought in late 2006 and it has always worked well. I love this player so I hope Sandisk figures out how to make tham again
5,SanDisk Sansa m250,"Sure the thing feels cheap, but it sure gets the job done. Plug it into a USB port and drag and drop in files, you're good to go. I use mine sorta like a Shuffle; just drag in 2GB of stuff and let it go random. The interface is pretty simple to use, and the battery life isn't bad. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Pretty good for being so cheap,I'm really liking my Sansa Sandisk. I've had it several weeks now and I use it almost everyday. I'm on my second battery which maybe is just because it came with a cheap battery. The battery that came with the player only lasted about 7-8 hours. Still not a bad amount for how cheap the player is.Pros of this playersmalllight weighteasy to useuses 1 regular AAA battery so no charging necessarydecent ear budsgood soundConsnot a super long battery lifewhen you change songs to quickly it locks up (I had to actually remove the battery one time to get it to reset)A belt hook would have been nice (It comes with an arm band but it was to tight on my arm to use)I've still not figured out the feature to have my own personlized play list but I do like the set up of the menu overall. You can play by artist or album. I think I will like it even more when I've figured out the playlist feature.I would definitely recommend this player as an option to a more expensive IPod.
1,Don't listen to them,"This product freezes all the time! It will eventualy lock up and not let you in.Other than that HUGE problem there are some other issues:Device locks up when using playlistsHas no way to 'arrange' your songs, just alphabetical.buttons are not easy to push, usualy require pushing them twice to funtionIncluded headphones are uncomfortableThe sound does not get very quiet so it's not good for late at night"
5,Easy to Use,"I bought this about a year ago at about 2x the current offering price. It was a great value then and is a complete steal now for anyone considering it. I was able to rip and load songs quite easily using Windows drag & drop. So easy, in fact, that I don't think I read the instructions booklet. It has operated without problem for me since it came out of the packaging. Fine capacity and crisp sound. Highly reccomended."
3,"product OK, service good","I bought this MP3 player in December and used it for a month before it cannot response to computers any more. I called the technical support and they replaced a new MP3 player within three weeks, free UPS shipping for the customer. The new one is working all right."
3,nice player but...,i have a similar sansa with a 512mb capacity. this one seems identical except for memory capacity. its lightweight and easy to use with one hand (while jogging for instance) with a adjustable blue backlit screen.i dont use much of the playlist features but the particular model i received seems to make my mp3s skip. i dont know if its my music or a problem with the player itself.
1,SanDisk Sansa m250 MP3 player,Second Sansa MP3 player in two years that I've purchased that has quit working. Will not buy another one.
3,Too loud,"I bought this one to replace the iRiver T10 that mysteriously stopped working last week. It was okay, but I sent it back the next day because I couldn't turn the sound down low enough. It went from sort-of loud to mute with one click. Not what I wanted. Looked easy to use, which is good because the instruction manual is at the ""see spot run"" level. Never could figure out how to store FM presets."
3,Don't Buy This Product,"While the sound quality and portability of this product is great, the thin little buttons are extremely difficult to press, making switching songs and albums a pain (literally). I would not recommend this product for that reason alone. I regret buying it because using it has become a very frustrating experience."
5,toothetts,"these tooth brushes are great for cleaning the inside of your mouth when you have dentures. a regular brush is to hard,"
3,Fun but not as nice as the ones from the packer website.,"I have had several cheeseheads in my day... And through various mishaps, I've misplaced or destroyed them (okay, my cat did...) and I really felt like I needed to honor my team by replacing it - again.Since it was several dollars cheaper through amazon, I opted to order here... and while it looks the same as the other ones I've had, the foam is, I don't know, mushier than the other ones. Its so mushy actually that just barely touching it leaves dents. It has the same ""original cheesehead"" emblems in the brim as my last one but I think it has to be second quality or something.I don't have a problem with second quality stuff but just say so next time!"
2,Not up to expectations,The cheese head doesn't fit very comfortably on most peoples head because the hole is shallow. The foam can also easily tear if you're not careful. My son really wanted it for Christmas so I bought it but if I had seen it in person first I probably wouldn't have bought it.
5,one of the best i have ever baught,This product is by far up there with best when it comes to product quality. the knobs are great nice and stiff so that there is no movement from vibrations the led lightin is of great amount of brightness in low light areas. clarion did good on this one the sound quality is of the best i rank this up ther with the arc audio 7band EQ with i also own the rca make this products a breez to install also cant mess it up

2,Save Your $$,"One would think that a publisher/author would invest in an editor to review the work before releasing it to the public. This book is a pig's breakfast.Consider: p. 48. Step 10: Go to the Styles Palette and click on the water drop style icon [the one you made in a previous example] . . ..What icon?What previous example?What is an example? I thumbed through the pages and could not find one 'example.'Boys and girls, it goes on and on. Use your money to go see a movie and use what's left over for a trip to Hong Kong. This book was a lot of money for rubbish.Positive point? The paper seems to be of good quality."
4,"Madeleine Peyroux does a fine job on this song, ...","but I have to say that if you like this great tune by Bob Dylan, check out the rendition by Shawn Colvin, which is by far my favorite."
2,Just a practical guide. Not suitable for research.,"Although it has some interesting insights about literary translation, the effort of compiling all that empirical research lacks the rigor of an academic research, which would have made it more interesting and much more useful!"
5,MANTIS FIST BOXER/ TIGER FROM CANTON,"THIS IS A GOOD, FAST, FULL OF ACTION FIGHTING MOVIE...THE COLORING IS BEAUTIFUL, AND THE STORY LINES ARE GOOD...HOORAY...I WILL SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS MOVIE..."
2,Knock off movie,"Bad movie, Stupid plot. Some of the movie was decent but other than those parts, this was crap. It has nothing to do with any of the other children of the corn films and he who walks behind the rows isn't even in it. Its a total rip-off. The end."
1,Boring and Tim Robbins was barely even in this film!,Rip off! This is like how Scream puts Drew Barrymore on the cover but she has a small part! And the rest of the film was so boring! What is the plot!
2,literate but boring,"Historical novel about the many loves of Byron, Shelley, and Keats, though Byron's affairs are necessarily abridged (or it'd be a ten-volume novel). The Marys --Wollstonecraft and Shelley--come off as women who really don't give a fig about anything but their lovers. Their still-in-print, important books here get written and discarded in single paragraphs, while they fret and moan for pages about infidelities, despite being alleged proponents of free love. I don't know if this is who/how they were, but it's disappointing to read about and boring to me. Weak women mooning over men isn't a particularly interesting plot to me. Still, at moments, this novel did fascinate me. An uneven sort of experience, and I confess to flipping past pages quite a few times as it dragged."
4,A good mix,"A good mix, with 7 out of 10 winners, according to these ears: Spain, Greece (covering two discs), Portugal (Fado), Egypt (Bellydance), Gypsy, and Zulu.On the other hand, the discs representing Ghana, the Seychelles and Trinidad sound like something insipid heard in an airport lounge, while passing through."
1,Severin Roesen: A chronology,A very disappointing book. All photos except front and back cover are in low quality black and white.Front and back cover are also in poor quality.Nothing much to see.
2,"A litlle disapointing,( but my fault)","I had high expectations of this issue, but it appeared to be a little ""childish"" film, a little boring, scetches made in a simple wayof Mtukudzi, mostly alloneNo real concerts, as I expected, with enthousiastic crowds, but repeatingsweet scenes, made by simple studio people, often repeated in the sameboring spots. No close ups from the sidemans-mucisians.Sorry that I bought it.Tom Smit, Zaandam, The Netherlands."
4,Meister der Musik- The J.B.O.- Saga continues...,"""Meister der Musik"" is another great CD by Germnay's most feared Fun-Rock-Band J.B.O. The four guys from Erlanngen mock on everything! An acapella-version of Van Halen's ""Jump"" is just one of the 20 great songs. But J.B.O. also makes fun of hits like ""I swear"", ""Backstreet's back"" or the German band ""Rammstein"". With fast and loud guitar-riffs J.B.O gives all these songs a new appearance and their outstanding extraodinary lyrics are the top of their songs. But on the whole this CD isn't as good as ""Explicite Lyrik""- the best CD ever made. So if you think about buying a J/B.O.-CD (it's worth it!!!)- go for this one and if you still got some money left...spend it on ""Meister der Musik"""
1,Not what I was hoping for,"This book is actually 3 linked short novels, the first of them was excellent which only made the next two more disappointing.The second story is nothing but a primer for S & M sex with a few pages of thriller added to the end and the third, though it has mre action then the second is about hale travelogue dedicated to European prostitutes. I was expecting Mitch Rapp and got De Sade intead....No Thanks"
2,Not my cup of tea,"I bought this on the basis of the author, Mr. Ringo. I'm addicted to his other series, especially the Posleen Wars. I was prepared to get addicted again, but it was not to be. I'll wait for the next installment of the Council Wars or the Posleen saga, knowing that those will be more to my tastes."
1,You gotta be kiddin me!,"I was looking forward to an action packed read about, a guy laying waste to some Terrorist baddies. Instead all I got was a lesson on rape, torture and S&M.;I am in no way a prude or holier than thou but I was deeply disturbed by this book and the carefree way the author describes rape and S&M.If; bondage is your thing go for it, dont dedicate two thirds of a novel to it."
2,Not what I expected but a good read for some...,"I find John Ringo's writing style to be a very smooth read with well developed characters. Unfortunately, this book should be rated ""X"" because there is not only a lot of sex in the book, it is very graphic and detailed. And its focused on bondage and domination and in one case the savage multiple rape of a teenage hooker by the main character. The politics of the book would be labeled ""right wing"" but only by the neo-communists of the world. By a student of history who has read books written before the left completely took over academia, its actually a fair, if somewhat cynical, assessment of the way things really are.If graphic and detailed sex, especially rape, offends you, avoid this book."
1,Spec Ops or BDSM?,"I was so into the first quarter of the book and then it devolves into this sex manual for BDSM. How pathetic, I skipped it all only to get the next ""good part"" only to find myslef if big sexyland again. If you skip the sex there are about 60 pages to read in this book. Ringo is a good writer but gets caught up in his pathetic sex life which he obviously is living through vicariously in this book. Avoid at all costs."
1,Really bad compared to the author's other works,"I have truly enjoyed most of Ringo's other works -- especially the Prince Roger series and the Posleen war series.This book, however, was truly bad unless you happen to be a Ghengis Khan conservative and you hate women. The plot revolved around unbelievable action scenes interspersed with explicit, often sadistic sex scenes, and frequent political diatribes.I am hoping this book was an aberration and that the author returns to his earlier style in the future."
3,This book is a James Bond fantasy...,"...or would be, if James Bond were into BONDage and Domination.The hero has superhuman luck to be in exactly right place at exactly right time -- and with exactly right skills, -- to disrupt a major terrorist operation, with a lot of naked female victims, some of whom end up seriously kicking a** alongside the hero, before jumping into bed with him. Oh, and the terrorist operation in question is so ridiculously overcomplicated, the fact that no one ELSE stumbled onto one of its stages took even more luck. John, are you channeling Ian Fleming?And I do not know where Ringo gets his information about B&D; scene, but I spotted some major errors which, this being a family website, I can not point out."
2,Way different .. not to most readers' taste?,"SPOILER ALERT!!I've enjoyed Ringo's other books (Council Wars, Posleen War, Empire of Man). This one *started* well enough: discharged SEAL witnesses college kidnapping and saves the day. After that, though... he ends up in witness protection and acting as an off-the-books agent, and while waiting for his next assignment, is spending WAY too much time for my taste picking up young lovelies to act out his bondage/domination fantasies on.I understand he said this was a book he felt he had to get out of his system. Fine. But a *series* of them? Sorry, John, not for me."
2,"one of those ""why does t his exist"" books","I always wonder about books like this.If you're gonna write SM stuff then do.If you're gonna write milfic stuff then do.why exactly would you want to combine them?Dunno about the SM stuff - not that into it and NOT into reading about it.The milfic stuff isn't bad - way over the top in the ""smoking hole cuz we hate you"" area but it isn't bad for I guess.At any rate, while I tend to like Ringo's stuff (altho once he farms it out it goes downhill fast) this is not one of those that I like, and I probably won't be picking up the sequel. Ick."
2,Pretty boring read.,This book contain 3 arcs of a military fantasy porn story. While the first arc is as unrealistic as it get it was mildly entertaining. It gets boring from there.
4,"put this in your ""toolbox""!","This is just a good ""tool"" to have around your house. Even if you don't throw any parties this year (or any year), it will come in handy, whether you want a good martini recipe or if the evening calls for something silly like ""Alabama Slamma's"".The book is easy to use, and will be well-enjoyed by the adventuresome who are looking for a buzz more refined than a ""sixer of bud.""I have also given this book to a couple of friends who are normally difficult to shop for on their birthdays, and they both loved it. Cheers!"
1,Nasty,"One of the worst singers ever! I like Spanish music like Alejandro Fernandez, Ana Gabriel, Juan Gabriel, these are real popular artists! Because they can sing!!! As for Graciela...Keep trying!!"
1,She might be the greatest singer.....SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!,"The only place I think she would be a great singer is somewhere were music doesnt exist!!! Her voice is uniquely annoying, and weird. Dont waste your money on this!! I think it stinks!!!"
1,"Love Moms, Hate this book","This is a cute little book and nothing more. Pass it up and pick up a copy about the making of the shows which are shabbily covered in this tired little publication. The photos are nothing rare or extraordinary, and the writing is dry and stale. The concept is a cute idea, but the potential is unrealized. Too bad. The quality of the book is poor. Poor photo reproduction, poor paper quality. A quickie knockoff book. There's nothing in here you haven't read before in TV nostalgia books. Sorry, Moms."
2,A bit tough`,"I was hoping this book was more ""portable"" (aka traveling) but in fact it's about socks named for travels. Nice format with the spiral binding but the patterns use charts and find charts harder to use. They are also not the simplest of patterns. I guess some people want the challenge but I was expecting a book of patterns to use WHEN traveling, not ABOUT traveling."
2,"Lovely patterns, but too many mistakes","I like the patterns and the spiral bound format, but the book contains way too many errors, and either you scribble on your copy to correct them or you'll have to print the corrected pages from the Interweave website and attach them to the book. Interweave really need to sort out the quality of their books."
1,worst all in one EVER,"if I were to explain this product with only one word then the word would be crap... I bought the lexmark x7170 all in one, thinking I can add it to the print server I had bought for $80, and have a nice fax, copy and printer in my small office.. well let me tell you how wrong I was.. for some reson it wasn't working on the print server at all so I called lexmark and asked them why it wasn't... They replied bottom line, this product doesn't work on a print server unless it's OUR print server, hearing this news I asked how much there print server is, he replied $129. so I returned the piece of garbage and bought a Brother all in one, and withing minutes of getting home I was faxing printing and copying files USING MY COMPUTER to fax and exerything AND the best thing about the brother all in one.. I don't need a print server at all.. it networks, so I am gonna go sell my old print server now.. have fun, and if you bought this crappy lexmark I feel really bad for you."
5,Best for your buck!,"This book has to be one of the best books that focuses on passing the GED test. It starts off with practice test(s) to identify what areas you are strong and/or weak in. From there you then study the material needed to actually pass the GED. It cuts out all the hassle,(what the competitor books suggest when having guidelines to study all subjects.)The material is easy to read and makes knowledgeable sense to the everyday person. Not only is the material in the book itself great but the price is also! Would recommend this book for anyone in need of passing the GED."
2,HORRIBLE battery life,I love the look and brightness of this light but you may get 2 dozen uses if you're lucky on each $8 battery. You also can't find the camera battery just anywhere.I have to buy another light just to afford my ride into work. I am replacing batteries every month and i'm never feeling comfortable riding unless I have at least 1 spare in my bike pouch.I'd love to keep it but can't rely on it turning on every time.
4,great,"I had no problems with this flat panel, no dead pixels. Had it for about a month now. It definately has the best base i have seen in a flat panel. Good buy."
1,HP has the worst technical support on the planet!,"On a basic fuctionality level the monitor performance is good. But when you alternate between landscape and portrait modes using the auto pivot feature, the icons are thrown all over the place and there is no option for the monitor to remember the icon positions; you have to manually adjust the icons everytime you employ the pivot feature. When i called tech support, i got a woman in India who did not speak proper english, was incapable of understanding my problem, and knew nothing. It was escalated to a ""higher level"" of tech support and i was assured i would receive a call back, which i never received. My old Viewsonic monitor had the 'remember icon' feature, and was much easier to use. I'll never buy another Hewlett-Packard product again. After 2 bad HP computers and now this, coupled with non-existent tech support, i would advise everyone out there to look elsewhere other than Hewlett-Packard for your computing needs."
2,waste of my money,"I have 2 boys 7 & 8 and thought with the summer months approaching I could use some good advice on how to handle their sibling rivalry. What I learned from this book was that I am doing what needs to be done, and I probably could have added advice that wasn't in the book. It was a waste of my money as it offered no new insight for me.If you are new to children with siblings then maybe this book will help you, but odds are, if you already are dealing with sibling rivalry and looking for advice, this is not the book for you. It was a big disappointment based on the reviews I read. Oh well, I guess I'll keep searching - or perhaps write my own book."
2,Why?,"Why would you order this for $260.00 when ordering seasons 1-7 individually will cost you $172.00? Yes, it's convenient to have the disks in one box but not for that amount of money."
1,Stay Away!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself and within a week it stopped working, at frist I ignored it and reset the time. The watch would freeze and stop working. This happened several times,so I contacted Amazon and requested a replacement. Amazon was great and they quickly sent me a replacement. The replacement arrived and for the next few days it worked prefectly. About three weeks later the replacement also stopped working. The hands would freeze for hours and then randomly start working and then freeze again. After two replacements I finally requested a refund instead. I have owned several Timex watches this is by far the worst."
4,Timex Men's T41101,"I bought this watch based on style and the reviews posted here. I needed a watch that would not break the bank for my everyday use. I just received the watch today, I did notice the watch looked kinda small but the band fit perfect no adjustment needed. I also liked the gun smoke color. The band looked a little thin for me. Keep in mind I was wearing a Diesel and Fossil watches for a long time.I did like the style , yes the color on the dial's are indigo no big deal. The functions are great for me simple and big numbers to look at. The instructions were self explanatory, but it did take me around five minutes to figure it out.In conclusion, If your looking for a simple and stylish watch for everyday use then this is it."
4,"Great watch for the money, but the band is to small","I was pleasantly surprised when I got this watch at how light and well made it is. The finish looks like titanium and wears well; the back light is great -- especially in bed, in the car or a dark theater. The digital portion of the watch is also good, and once you figure out the generic instructions on how to use and set the digital portion, it is fine.The only drawback I have found is the size of the band -- IT IS DEFINITELY MADE FOR A SMALL WRIST!!I ordered 5 links from Timex for $4.00 and I shouldn't have had to so -- this is Timex's way of cutting costs and it is unfair to its customers!!!Now if Timex would just make the same watch as an atomic or radio controlled watch with an adequately sized band, it would be great!"
4,Not bad really,"I'm pretty impressed with the slimx. The instructions are a bit useless and it takes a while, or took a while for me anyway, to figure out this bit of kit. All in all though I'm impressed, the sound is clear as a bell--which is most important when you think about it, and it looks good (except for earphones which are a bit star trekish if you ask me)."
3,Not as great as I expected,"The remote is small and hard to use and read, and the rechargable batteries do not last as long as iRiver claims they will. Also, I cannot find a car kit that meets this player's specs."
5,The BEST player EVER .,"let's get to the point : I've got one iMP-350 for about 3 weeks now and it is PERFECT. NO FLAWS WHATSOEVER !!!! trust me on this ! the only small prob is the carrying case because it doesn't have a ""belt hook"" and is rather soft !!!5 stars on everything(design/sound/features/antishock/.../...)G E T I T N O W ! ! !"
4,Worth the $,"I've had the player for about 3 months now. It is a quality product. I use it with B&O; headphones . The headphones that came with the unit are, however, also quite good.The only problems are that there are too many parts to mess with. It would have been easier if the controls were all on the unit. Also the controls are so small they are hard to read.I would however recommend it for being a good quality -- very light, yet sturdy machine"
3,"Bad anti-shock, otherwise okay","I had this player for about 3 months before the antishock just wimped out. For the first three months, I had no problem, but now I can hardly walk down the street and listen to a CD. The problem is mainly with regular CDs. MP3 CDs play well, and the other features of this player work fine, but I am very annoyed that such a fancy thing can't have good shock protection. I have jacked it up to 180 seconds, the highest it goes, and it skips more than other 45-second ESP players I have had. So take that into account. You can always just rip all your CDs and make a big MP3 CD that won't skip as much, but you shouldn't have to do that for the price.I recently upgraded the firmware and I must say that's a very nice feature. They keep correcting bugs and adding features, so it's nice."
4,"Unit Great, CS not","I purchased this back on 11/29 for my wife as a xmas gift. Wife loves it, first CD/MP3 player she's owned that actually DOES NOT SKIP while walking.... Buttons are a challenge at times and it took a bit to figure out controls, etc. And make sure you FULLY charge the batteries before using first time. Thought it was broken at first......So if you are looking for good player, this one is it. ...."
2,Mixed feelings...,"I have mixed feelings about this player. I had one for about 6 months and the connection between the remote and the player started to short out. Had to return it.Great sound, fun gadget though. Useless headphones and the velveteen carrying case is a joke."
4,Fun features,"I didn't give the imp-350 5 stars because of the earphones; very uncomfortable; I can't use them. I am using an old set of headphones until I get a chance to buy new ones. Otherwise, great little machine. Lots of features I haven't even gotten into yet. Sounds great."
3,"very nice design, but there's a big fault to it","i bought this iriver slimx just a couple weeks ago. my baby cousin was meddling with the remote one day, and he put it in his mouth and broke the remote. after that, i did not have any means of seeing what songs i'm listening to. THIS IS A BIG FAULT to the cd player. think about it - without the remote, you have no access to another LCD! when i had the remote, i liked it."
1,I won&#65533;t buy another MP3 player...,"I ordered a RioVolt SP350 as a Christmas present for my husband. At the time there were no reviews posted, but I assumed that this one was at least as good at the SP250, which I own and love...We were impressed with the size and weight of the new player, although I thought it was pretty ugly. Then we tried to use it, but got a ""No Disc"" error every time, even with store-bought CDs. By that time, negative reviews had been posted, so I returned it to Amazon.com for a refund. My husband then ordered an iRiver SlimX iMP350 to take its place. We loved the design and features of the iRiver player, but it wouldn't recognize MP3 CDs, either, and audio CDs skipped horribly. We tried to upgrade the firmware, but it wouldn't recognize that CD, either. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts to reach iRiver tech support, he returned the player for an exchange...the replacement player [did] not work either..."
3,Easy fun,"Friends is not the best thing on TV and at times can be dull and predictable but it goes down easy. Fun for rainy or sick days or when friends come over and you just want to vegetate and not think for half an hour. This is ""not-thinking"" TV and while there is alot of going round (and more being made all the time) and I shouldn't really encourage that, this is still enjoyable.A guilty pleasure."
5,Friends Season 3,This dvd set came exactly as its description descibed it. It came extremly fast too.
2,Just okay,"Most of my orders have been great, except this one. The case was broken. Luckily I use super glue to fix the case but I don't know what happened."
1,Total Dingo's Kidneys,"Douglas Adams was a middling talent of midly humorous observations. Like most writers, he spent a good part of his life desperate for any type of success and then once he achieved it (with Hitchhiker's) he spent the remainder of his life lamenting that he wanted nothing to do with what made him successful. The book is a hodge-podge of erratum that would never have seen the light of day if it had been written by an unknown writer, but because Adams was well-known it has not only been published but endowed with a misguided huzzah of which it is most unworthy. In short, the book is a complete waste of paper--trees died for this pap-- and at most it makes a good doorstop."
3,For true fans only,"The Salmon of Doubt gives the impression by its sub title that this may be the 6th hitchhiker book. It is not. This is a collection of essays and speeches that DNA had given, with a few short stories. The short story titled the Salmon of Doubt is a Dirk Gently novel that does not have a firm ending, which is obviously because DNA died before he finished writing it. All in all there were some astute observations and some wonderfully comic moments from DNA. I would only recommend this book to true die hard friends of DNA. For those of you who are thinking of giving Mr. Adams a chance, go read the Guide to the Galaxy first.ThanksT"
2,Adams Fragmented,"Most of the book is a rather pedestrian compilation of Douglas Adams writings at various times and for disparate reasons. The short story ""A Salmon of Doubt"" at the end of the book is Douglas at his best, but is tantalizingly unfinished."
2,"Sorry, Douglas, I was disappointed...","Likely never intended for publication, but published anyway (as every famous writer's memoirs and journals are), this is a collection of ideas that Douglas had. I was incredibly disappointed, as it was toted to me as his fragmentary final book. BOO!Spend your money more wisely, buy Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency series by Douglas or his books about endangered animals. You will get way more out of them. Sorry, Douglas, rest in peace."
5,read as slowly as you can,"I've never actually wanted to be able to stop myself reading a book before. There are books I've given up on or thrown away in the past, but that was easy because they were garbage. I would dearly loved to have been able to put The Salmon of Doubt down. As words formed sentences, then paragraphs, then pages it began to register that I was coming to the end of the last new material I would ever read from Dougas Adams, and try as I might I just couldn't stop."
3,"Worth a read, but not compared to his earlier novels","I knew very little about Adams beyond reading his Hitchiker ""Triology"" before picking up this book. It serves as a good way of learning more about him. Not only is much of the writing funny, it is insightful as well. While I'm glad to read his ""last novel"" it is far from complete. It's very disconcerting to get into this episode of Dirk Gently and suddenly for a few chapters the point of view abrutly shifts to the first person and then goes back to a few more chapters and suddenly stops. The editor does warn you about this and if you are a die hard fan then you will want to pick up this book. It's worth a look by everyone else as well, for the random essays on making a good cup of tea, to why he loved Bach."
4,"Two books, really: Adams' articles and a short story","This book is really two books. The first is a collection of articles written by or about Douglas Adams. The second is the short story 'The Salmon of Doubt' which is said to have been rescued from Adams's computer after his death.The collection of articles was so fascinating that the story, appearing toward the end of the text, failed to sustain my interest.If reading for the articles, make sure to look to the end of the book to read what Richard Dawkins had to say about Adams after his untimely death."
4,Cannot give it 5 stars: perfection would be if DNA would still be here,"Only 17 reviews for this book? I cannot say more than has been said by other reviewers. Some of the articles in this book you can find over the net, but I discovered that having them printed in a book is better for your eyes and your feelings (what Adams would say about my call for less trees?!). In short, an excellent collection of essays about ecology, life, technology and tea, real tea. Funny and (very) intelligent. The unfinished novel that makes the end of the book is very imaginative and even in its half-baked format is intriguing and provocative."
4,"In the name of the moon, I will reveiw this book!","Serena is such a arcade going junk food eating, klutz we rarely get to see her leader side. If you have the other books this book's layout is just a tiny little bit differant. There is kind of like a Darian hall of fame and some of the normal sections in the books are shorter on Serena's book to make room for the new sections. The one thing that disapointed me about this book is they had almost nothing about Luna! I love Luna and she and Artemis are my favorite charecters. I wanted to now more about her as well as Serena and was suprised that almost nothing about her was in here. I think they should make books like this about Artemis and Luna."
3,OK...,"This book, Meet Sailor Moon: Crystal, was obviously made to encourage more fans to learn about Sailor Moon. HOWEVER, if you are a REAL Sailor Moon fan, this stuff should come as a big ""DUH"" sign in front of you. I mean, don't we all know that Usagi is the Princess of the Moon? Why do they call it a ""secret"", then?Another REALLY annoying thing is that this book is too short and incomplete. It's only 96 pages (about 1/6 of an inch), and they do not show her SuperS info or her StarS info (such as Eternal Sailor Moon).So DIE-HARD collectors, get this book. Regular fans, it's already what you know, so why spend money on it?"
5,Very Good!!!,"This book was awesome! I must admit, it was pricey, but well worth it! Michelle really knows what she's talking about!"
3,Smaller than expected,Product arrived quickly but was smaller than it looked as pictured on the web site.
1,Great Gift,This was a great gift for my son & his wife - they have had many sleepless nights with a new baby. After New Years Day dinner we brewed one of the blends and had it with pie. The aroma and taste was excellent!
2,Very poor form,To my surprise the instructor on this DVD had very poor form. I also thought she could have been more creative with the weight part of the workout.
1,"How to you say ""utter nonsense"" backwards?","Oh, the spirit of Jung and his latter day disciples. The holy ""unconscious"" is canonized, in fact, deifies everything human. The subjective has become the norm.Now this ""author"" says that we say things forward AND backward and the backwards thing can be, like anything, I'm sure, interpreted by our therapists, the police, and anyone else who claims to be qualified to do so.Yeah, and I can understand Lithuanian in Korean script too, only if I acknowledge what my ""unconscious"" tells me. If such a claim is ever used against me, I'll tan the hide of the accuser, then see to the punishment of the law enforcement quacks who buy into it!Don't waste your time with this waste. If you want to read an examination of what ""reverse speech"" really indicates, I recommend the review of this book in the Volume 8, No. 3 of ""Skeptic"" magazine. That attempts something the author of this tripe never comprehended: objectivity."
1,Man-hating book,"I admit, as a husband, I am not perfect; I have my flaws. My wife recently came across this book and now it has become her relationship bible. Problem is she has her flaws too (no one is perfect). This book directs all the blame at the guy and tells the women their husband is wrong-always wrong.This ""self help"" book has caused more stress and fights between us than before she started reading it. Every wife deserves her prince but this book has pounded into her head that I must be her Prince Leopold and that if I fail to ride home on a white horse with a bouqet or flowers in hand every night after a hard day at work then something is wrong with me and I do not love her. Nonsense. I finally asked her to stop reading and refering to it.What the author fails to realize is that it takes two to make a marriage work. We BOTH have flaws and again, no one is perfect."
4,A first Simon Wood for me!! Hey & I can swim,"Can i just say that I REALLY LOVE MY KINDLE!! I read tons more, at a faster pace and sooo many different types of books that normally i wouldn't even take a second glance at. I'm truly opening up my reading variety that's for sure.Eeeeaagh!! It took me about halfway thru this the book before i started getting into it. I don't know if was that i just finished a book that was packed with adventure, fast paced, mystery, & suspenceful. So usually i need to read the total opposite after reading a book like that. There were a couple of things that threw me off toward the end. It was good, not the greatest, but i would recommend to another avid reader & for only .99 noone can go wrong."
3,Accidents Waiting to Happen,"Interesting fast paced story, but really, did the proof-reader and the editor go on vacation at the same time? ALL of the MANY ERRORS were extremely distracting. Typos abound, many missing words, reversed words in sentences, etc. I can't recall ever reading anything this poorly proofed. Insurance professionals will recognize many property/casualty policy terms and references in this story as well as life-related policies."
2,"Awful writing, even for a $0.99 book","I learned a bit about the life insurance business. Other than that, I don't have much good to say about this book. It reads like the author was paid on a word count. The characters are razor thin and the dialogue is stilted.I had just finished reading the 'Laura Cardinal' series by J. Carson Black before Amazon suggested this one. Those books are FULL of typos but at least the charcters are rich and dialogue feels authentic.Full disclosure: I cut my losses after reading to 40% in this book."
2,Waste of .99 cents,"This just seemed too implausible for me. I kept reading thinking it would get better but it didn't. I finished it and delted it from my kindle. But, for .99 and you just want something to pass the time it might be alright. I don't have that much time to read so I really want to finsih a book and be able to recommend it to others."
3,I was expecting better from Simon Wood,"""Accidents Waiting to Happen"" started out fine...exciting, making me wonder what was going to happen next. But it went downhill quickly.There definitely wasn't enough character development in this novel. There was only one character I cared anything about in the book and he was a minor character...Bob, the best friend of the protagonist, Josh Michaels. I don't have to like all the characters in a book but it does help to like some of them and care whether they get killed off or not.There were too many accidents/coincidences/plot twists. I wish Wood had picked the best out of all of them and developed one or two of them further rather than skipping here and there and everywhere. And the ending was really unbelievable.I normally like Wood's books so this one hiccup won't keep me from reading other of his books but I really wish this one had been better. Promising idea but poor execution."
5,A great read,Mr. Wood is a winner from my viewpoint. What talent. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.
2,barely worth the price,I try to read most of the reviews on books like this before buying. After reading this book I do not understand the 4 & 5 star reviews. Poorly edited. Poor to mediocre writing. Annoying to really stupid characters. Readable if you have low expectations. It does have its moments.
4,At the Top of My List!,"This was the first book I have read by this author, but it won't be the last! Exciting and engaging from the start, the writing was excellent and the story line easy to follow without being predictable.A totally believable plot, especially in today's world, and one that makes you question your own security, definitely!I read the whole book without stopping, as I didn't want to miss what was coming next. I then passed it on to a friend, who started it on a Sunday night, and decided to stay home from work Monday and finish it!I highly recommend you try this author if you haven't yet, and this book will definitely hook you. Not for the faint of heart, and certainly not a cozy, but equally realistic and hardboiled."
4,Better than the first,"Many times an author's second book is not quite as good as the first one, but this one is better. Fleming seems to be settling into her setting and characters, and does a fine job of maintaining the tension between the protagonists. This is an adult romance that seems entirely believable. Russ is drawn to Clare's vitality and intelligence, but is also a responsible husband in love with his wife. The helicopter incident is well done with what seems to be knowledgeable detail. The bigotry of a ordinarily decent people is handled well. The writer does not beat the drum, but lets us know her stance. (I really dislike writers with an agenda.) I wait for the next one with impatience."
4,good foot stompin piano,"if you like original really good foot stompin piano music, this is it. just too bad they didn,t remaster some of the tracks because they sound like they were recorded from half wore out 78's"
3,Rare and important to Jelly Roll Morton fans,"Kansas City Frank Melrose is said to play in the style of Jelly Roll Morton and to a degree he does. Melrose is in no way as inventive as Morton and by way of comparison Melrose displays a limited musical vocabulary. The recording do however drip authenticity as an example of solo stride piano as played in the Kansas City, and Chicago clubs of the era. Unfortunately little effort went into improving the quality of the primitive original recordings when the CD was mastered. Frank deserved better treatment"
3,"small, but nice","This necklace has a nice design and I like the lapis.However, the pendant is smaller than expected."
1,"Cardboard characters, canned exposition","I really couldn't get into this one, although I tried several times -- so I haven't actually finished it, and it's possible the second half is better than what I read. But I felt that the characters were overblown caricatures, the world-building was something like those cheesy styrofoam sets from the original Star Trek, and the plot just wasn't holding together. The part I really couldn't stand was the fact that in the main couple, one character was younger, smaller, weaker, more naive, *and* always on the bottom (also gentler, weepier, smarter, etc). I like more equality in gay relationships, and I just wasn't seeing it here. I was also bothered that both of these characters (but especially the younger one) had little or no knowledge of the world or culture they grew up in. There were a few weak explanations for this fact, but I just didn't buy it -- it seemed to me like a poor excuse for a heavy-handed exposition."
5,Loose Balls,"Jayson Williams is so funny in this book. It is hilarious and he isn't afraid to tell you anything. I mean anything! He tells you how some players don't like other players and how some of the players have very strange habbits. Any fan of basketball should read it, even if you don't like Jayson Williams. I never really watched Jayson Williams, but after I read the book, he is probably one of my favorite players. This is definatly the best book I have ever read."
3,"You'll Laugh So Hard, You Might.....Dribble","Jayson Williams' Loose Balls is the basketball equivalent to Jim Bouton's Ball Four. Although I would consider this light reading, the book had some great stories that made me laugh out loud. Williams spares no expense at uncovering some of the game's inside anecdotes. He rips into several NBA players and coaches (poor ""Hammer"" Gilliam), but he also allows the reader to laugh at him, through his own personal tales of wit and humor. In this book, Williams says a lot of the things people want to say, but are afraid to. The writing leaves a lot to be desired, but you can't help but laugh at the content. Jayson Williams says he wants to be remembered as a man who turned his life around, and became a good person. By the end of the book, you will feel this way about him, and you will have a big smile on your face in the process."
2,Only recomended for Hardcore NBA fans,"Several of the short stories in this book were amusing, but its not very well put together or well written. Not to mention, you wonder if he just put whatever he could to pad the page total, telling stories about one of his teamates heating a roast beef sandwich and such leave you saying, who cares? But Jay gives you a good inside look on the NBA from his eyes."
3,"Not Bad, But Not What I Expected","I was eagerly looking forward to Jayson's book after reading his article in GQ. When the book was released the description on the jacket only heightened my excitement. What I found between the covers left me disappointed. I thought Jayson would give up the dirt on the NBA players as the book was compared to the book ""Ball Four"". Instead Jayson seemed to list Armen Gilliam for every dubious award. Many times Jayson would allude to a player from Orlando that came to New Jersey but would never use the players name. His choice for most overrated player...the playground legends....please. It seemed that Jayson gave up just enough info to write a book but not enough to give the reader what he promised. It seems that Jayson did not want to offend any of the other NBA players and instead teased the reader."
3,"Good Athlete, Great Man but Rookie Author","""Loose Balls"" is very light reading. There are several parts that are LOL funny including one story that Jayson stole from Redd Foxx (""like me to slow down or stop""). Although quite entertaining, this book falls way short of giving the reader an inside look into the NBA. For me, this was more than compensated, by a look into the mind and HUGE heart of a GREAT human being. Jayson you would be welcomed as a role model to my children, despite what your friend Charles Barkley thinks. You are a Good Athlete, Great Man but a Rookie Author. Thanks for making the world a much better place! I do recommend that you read this book. If you are not sure, it may help to know that Jayson is donating all his profits from ""Loose Balls"" to Charity."
2,Don't waste your time,"I bought this book to learn more about Jayson Williams, as many have called him a good man who found himself in a bad situation a few years ago. The truth is he is just like every other idiot who attracts bad situations. I could only make my way through half this book but I wish I hadn't even read that much. He is an immature unnintelegent punk who perfectly fits the idiot pro athlete stereotype and makes all his peers look bad.The book reads like this. So then I said, ""I oughta punch you in the mouth"". And then I did.Don't wast your time, or your money."
2,Wish it was better,"You know you want the players to shoot like in a real soccer game. But here, it feels like its the gameplay and graphics of FIFA 1997. There is nothing great to the game unless you want to murder your hand while you try to press all the buttons. wasted too much time making the franchise soccer mode while forgetting that the game is waht we want"
4,"Not perfect, but excellent for my purposes","This timer excels in a couple areas:- since it has a numeric keypad, you just type in the time you want, and then press <Enter>. Very easy.- When the time is up, it beeps persistently like an alarm clock for 30 seconds. After that, it beeps once every 10 seconds until you cancel it. Basically you WILL have to walk over and cancel this thing eventually or it will drive you crazy. This persistence can be a godsend or an annoyance depending on what you are timing and what you are doing when the time expires.- It also shows how much ""extra"" time has accumulated - in other words, how much time has passed in addition to the time you had originally set. This can sometimes be very helpful.Weaknesses:- The keys are rather small and require more concentration to press than I would like.- The display is also small and is not lit, so you have to walk right up to it to see how much time is left.Overall, it is a pretty good unit & I would buy it again."
3,OK,"French is a tough language to learn providing you are not French. I found my concentration behind the wheel as it were not at 100 percent. The product may be good for some people, but not for me. If I had taken French in school this is no doubt a good product. However, I did not."
1,Got a different version of this toner,"I loved the original Avalon Organic Botanicals Hydrating toner- as shown in this picture. That is what I wanted. Unfortunately, the product I received is the ""new, more sustainable"" version: [...] - the Lavender Luminosity version and I don't like it at all. It has a weird smell. The new one also does not say ""for sensitive skin"" on it and I have very sensitive skin. The picture on this product needs to be updated if the new version is being delivered."
3,1809 - Part 2,"This is best seen as a companion to the earlier volume on Aspern-Essling and Wagram. It is unfortunate that the earlier book has perhaps to large a subject while this one is possibly the ideal size for this format. It is a very accessible account of an engagement usually obscured by or glossed over in favour the larger battles that followed. As always very nicely illustrated, and presented."
2,Unnecessary Remake,"This movie was an unneeded remake of ""An Affair to Remember"" and ""Love Affair"" (1939). I thought it was nice how they used the same script for much of it, but how believeable is landing on a desert island and going on a Russian cruise ship? And the scenes, especially the last one, that has the same exact dialogue as ""An Affair to Remember"" falls very flat as these actors deliver their lines. Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant are highly superior to Beatty and Benning. It's cute, but was it really needed?"
3,A pale shadow of An Affair to Remember,"I'm afraid this movie is at best a pale shadow of its predecessor (An Affair to Remember). Annette Benning and Warren Beatty are woefully short on precisely those qualities which made Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant (in the original) so unforgettable -- wit, charm, chemistry, and STYLE. The presence of Kathleen Hepburn was no help -- the scene between her and Benning seems so stiff and uncomfortable beside the genuinely warm and charming meeting between Kerr and Cathleen Nesbitt (a truly gracious and affectionate lady, playing Grant's grandma). The only thing in this remake which challenges the original is Ennio Morricone's (as always) beautiful and moving score. It has the one thing the film as a whole lacks -- conviction."
2,A Disappointment,"This movie just never took off. I never could get into the ""love affair."" The music got on my nerves. Was that supposed to be 1920s, or 1930s style music? Whatever era, it didn't fit what was supposed to be a more modern treatment of the original. I thought Beatty and Bening were great in ""Bugsy."" But getting married must have hurt their on-screen chemistry."
1,Why?,"The first 75 minutes of this modern adaptation saunter along at a relaxed pace. While there's no real snap to the dialogue, and the acting by Warren Beatty and Annette Benning is familiar rather than inspired, the demands of the story are so slight that it doesn't matter. Imagine a pleasant cup of tea on a mildly cool day, with Katherine Hepburn tossed in for good measure, as Beatty's aunt with nothing profound to add. Then, as the story is about to finish up in a glazed stupour, a harsh right turn is made in order to prolong the film for another 25 minutes. Bear in mind that no substantial points are made in these last, glacial 25 minutes - we learn nothing more about the lead characters or their supposed undying love for each other. It's just that 75 minutes seems kind of short for a modern motion picture. Which begs the question, Why make this movie at all?"
2,Not the best choice for teaching your toddler manners,"The book introduces seven situations (including what to say after burping) and gives the ""proper"" response for each one.The situations are not the most relevant to a toddler's life (giving up your seat on a bus?), and the suggested responses are stilted (after bumping into someone, you're supposed to say ""I beg your pardon, sir."").This book is more about Sesame Street's familiar silliness than teaching practical politeness. For that, try Richard Scarry's Polite Elephant, also available in board book format.I was very disappointed in this book; I expected more from Sesame Street."
4,ANOTHER KEEPER....,"Read the Editorial Reviews for the book description:A very good and entertaining read. The characters were very believable and most very likeable. Unfortunately I knew who the villain was when the character was first introduced but KS made up for that with all the twists and turns. The novel wasa bit wordy but still a good and interesting read. Brandon is a man's man with real struggles and a heart breaking past that will make you want to cry for him. His love interest by the name of Alyson was there at first for the story that would boosther career but fell head-long in love with Brandon. She was a good strong character with fire and some kick to her. I appreciate the fact that KS allowed her to be strong and still when she was wrong didn't allow her pride to talk her out of a future with the man she loved. And KS know she can write a love scene!!!!! HONEY, I WANTED TO JUMP RIGHT IN THE PAGES.Read this novel you will not be disappointed."
4,First episode free,I recently found this series via some random web searches and you can watch the first episode at IGN at http://media.tv.ign.com/media/873/873849/vids_1.html . The series definitely has some great promise and I look forward to the release of the first episode. I have also been starting to read some of the Mangas and they also seem pretty good. Judging by those two things I rate this series at a 4 for now only cause I have yet to see much into the series.
1,Long and Boring - Blah!,"If I could've given this movie no stars or negative stars, I would have! This movie was incredibly boring and it was a struggle to watch the whole thing. It was supposedly just short of 90 minutes long and felt more like 3 hours. I watched the clock more than the movie, which incidentally, I watched at a cabin in the woods on Halloween. It wasn't scary at all and the jerky camera effect is sort of sickening. If watching a bunch of smug, dopey kids (who possess no savvy of how to survive and negotiate their way in the woods) falling apart and shouting ""F you, man!"" for 90 minutes, you'd probably love this flick. If that's not what floats your boat, skip it and watch just about anything else. A test pattern would be more interesting! I can't figure out how this got so hyped up. I guess it just goes to show that suckers being dragged in big time!"
1,Most overrated movie ever!,"I wounder what is all the fuzz about this movie. It's totally overrated and not scary at all, but boring to be frank."
2,"This is no ""Exorcist"".","I was in Europe when this movie debuted in theaters, and I couldn't wait to see it. After watching the video, I found myself feeling sorry for the folks who paid more than the $2.50 I did to see it. The premise is clever, but I found the characters annoying, the storyline slow and the abject horror to be missing. In the end, it was just another bad B-horror movie without the blood and gore. Perhaps the real crime is comparing ""Blair Witch"" to the ""Exorcist"", arguably the scariest movie of all time."
3,Don't listen to the HYPE!,"Once again a way over hyped movie,just watch it for a good bit of suspence and terror,and some excellent acting all round,very realistic. All these stories of people running out of the cinema screaming etc is way over the top. What you will hear at the end of the movie is a sigh and everyone saying ""is that it! "",because once again they have listened to the hype!."
1,Hollywood Hype,"This film is tedious, ill-conceived, poorly acted and not one bit scary. I'm loath to even give it one star, but it's the lowest rating allowed. It's obvious the actors had no idea what was going on and the plot is too pointless and annoying to induce any fear. A more interesting and fulfilling plot would be the clubbing to death of the female lead for lack of talent - in the least it would have relieved us of her endless yammering. An unoriginal waste of film, I'm left wondering if the filmmakers have ever been on a camping trip."
2,Good try,"I agree with a couple of the previous reviews. #1 rent it, don't buy it. And it's kind of like one of those movies you can only watch once. I think a thought process here was low budget=instant classic, ala Texas Chainsaw Massacre...which just isn't true. Sure it's intended to be a horror movie, but 80% of the movie just deals with them being lost in the woods. The ending (for me anyway) wasn't frightning at all. I think so much has been done in the way of technology/special effects of horror films and everyday violence on the local news that there will never be a horror movie ever again that will run people out of the theaters like Phantom of the Opera did in the 20s, Frankenstein in the 30s, and later The Exorcist. With murder everyday now on the local news, how can a movie scare any of us?"
2,"A--For Effort, D--For Implementation","I give them credit for creating a relatively unique film. There aren't too many like The Blair Witch Project. So it's a unique experience for most people.I wish more movie producers/directors/writers would realize that you don't have to see the scary thing to be scared. In fact, your own imagination is much better at scaring you that any special effect ever could be. So I give this film a great deal of credit, from that perspective.My real complaint is that the suspense didn't build slowly enough. Your mind and body need time to accept an increase in suspense. This didn't happen. They spent too much time on the preliminaries and then seemed to have little time left to scare you.Because this will be a new movie experience for many people. I do encourage you to see the film. However, rent it, don't own it. Once is more than enough."
3,Worth The Money To Rent?,"The movie was okay. It tried to bring back the classicness of older horror films. What i enjoyed most about the movie was that instead of these guys trying to be total bad boys, they were broken down mentally. For a first movie. They did a great job. And hope to see more of their work in the future. And it's nice to view a movie that does'nt include millions of dollars in graphics and all that stuff. It's worth the money to rent it."
2,more motion sick than scared,"Before watching this movie I had read that people were becoming ill from the jerky camera work. Even so, about 20 minutes into the film, I was surprised to realise I fell phyiscally bad, like after reading too long in the back seat of a car. The movie itself was scary, not so much because of the witch but because of the thought of being completely and forever lost in the woods. However, I felt so sick that I could not focus properly on the movie, and thus doubtless missed the full effect. After it was over I felt like I had been through and ordeal and not because I was so afraid. To sum up...those prone to motion sickness should watch at their own risk"
1,"Um, And the Hype was For?","I actually got excited to see this film. Boy was I dissapointed. Although the lack of effects does give it some credibility as a good piece of film making, it was not I repeat not, for those who like to be scared."
4,Neo-classical ghost story will give most viewers the creeps,"People either love this movie or hate it. I loved it, appreciating its gradual mounting of the supernatural threat until, too late, the characters realized that they have been surrounded and cut off from reality by it. The plot is remarkably simple, and similiar (read King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon for an interesting variation), unwary travelers wander from the beaten (aka SAFE) path and, one by one, fall victim to someTHING in the dark shrouded woods. The unseen and unknown are where the thrills come from, and the shaky hand held camera work gives the viewer the feeling/sensation of being an active participant in the unfolding events. The first time I saw this my movie blood ran cold and goosebumps sprouted on my arms and back. After repeated viewings I'm still studying the trees and shadows in the background, constantly searching for a glimpse of the unseen, but still heard, Blair Witch. Happy hunting..."
1,You have GOT to be kidding!,"This was one of the least scariest movies I have ever seen! I am 11 years old and I saw this movie with my friend and we laughed our heads off. A bunch of kids go into the woods hear some noises, aim the camera up there noses(nice)scream at rocks and sticks and the like. It was so patheticly un scary! People have said they don't want to go outside anymore! WHY ON EARTH NOT! All I saw to be scared of in this movie was some baaaaaad acting!"
1,Great Expectations but...,"Read many positive reviews, saw the website, got excited, rented it, and was ultimately disappointed. The acting was shaky, the stage was poorly set, the film wasn't frightening or anxiety provoking. Maybe starting out with some faux newspaper clippings or news reports covering the ""disappearance"" as wll as clippings relating to past manifestations. Instead the locals are pretty cavalier about what was supposed to be some pretty disturbing events. The bundles of twigs, the stone piles; even with imagination they were in a minimal context and just not frightening. Perhaps some human bones arranged in a ritualistic fashion or other more disturbing allusions to the evil that was afoot. Instead I found it to be just what it was: a ""mockumentary"" with an original idea but the product didn't bear out the theory. ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" was a film I found frightening, as was ""The Exorcist."" It's a fickle genre..."
1,STUPID!!,Here's a summary of the movie: 3 filthy mouth kids running around and screaming in a forest. That about summs it up really well. How could people like this movie. It was awful.
1,About as scary as a leafless branch.,"I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' on opening day in the summer of 1999. The theatre was packed because so much unnecessary hype surrounded the movie. Many people were stupid enough to believe it was real story. Never underestimate the power of marketing. The theatre was packed and what we got for our seven dollars was two hours of twigs, stick figures made out of twigs, and some of the loudest screaming I've heard since watching a clip of a Backstreet Boys concert. Part of this movie are supposed to tense and scary, but I couldn't see what the hoopola was about. At nighttime, the characters hear some suspicious noise in the forest and they start getting scared. I guess these guys have never been camping before. Then there is the ""famous"" ending. Be prepared with some earplugs."
3,interesting movie,"Well, I must be in the minority, because I liked this movie. Granted, it's no Titanic but it doesn't claim to be. I've never been to Maryland------so the scenery (if you want to call it that) was interesting to watch. And the language didn't bother me one bit----I live in a big city."
2,"Boring, But Sometimes Good","This movie was not scary, but it was acted as home video footage. So you can't really complain about it not being scary. I think this movie was made so the viewers can think to themselves, 'what if that was me?' Imagine yourself in a forest that you can't escape from, and especially if you keep getting encounters with ghosts.I gave this movie two stars because I thought it was boring, but there were a couple of freaky scenes, which were good.This film will probably be remembered as a film that a lot of people like and dislike. An equal movie, to be exact."
1,blair which project,"I waisted my money to go see this movie that was supposed to be the big great horror movie of all.and I would'nt pay one pennie to own it,it was the most boring movie ever the writers need to look up HORROR then try again."
2,Uhhh???,"Heather Donahue and company walks around in the woods, documenting their journey with a camcorder. Someone scares them with sticks and fingerpaint. That's it, nothing happens, the film just ends with the audience wondering why this film was made. But I give it 2 stars cause it has some weird and cosy atmosphere."
2,KILL THE GIRL...PLEASE,"Heard the hype? Maybe even heard how this was a true story? The line to buy the bridge starts right over here. Three of us watched this and kept wondering alound when it would actually get good. The female character talks like a truckdriver (sorry guys), and you actually want the killer to find her...early and efficiently. This is a silly movie."
1,Should have stayed an independent,"This film is not a piece of cinema, but an amateur horror film. Some people find this its most compelling aspect, it makes it believable to them, but it is in the end the film's achilles heel. Had ""dan and ed"" been schooled in the classics, they might have come up with a dense and interesting film, using the SAME TECHNIQUES. They simply lack the visual and narrative grammar to carry it off. Instead, the film comes off as sloppy and weak-storied. There's a ton of backstory, but the film itself lacks depth, intencity and direction. This film is a wasted opportunity to show the world the power of mockumentary filmmaking. Try Cannibal Holocaust (1980, Italian) on for size. This is a horror movie to scare only first-time filmgoers."
1,"It should be called ""The Boring Witch Project""","I actually remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it first came out in 1999. Sitting through this movie was absolutely mind numbing! This was supposed to be one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and what did I get for my money? A bunch of screaming and cuss words. The actors in the movie just run around and screaming in terror the whole time. That's supposed to be scary? And the filming itself is really dark and you can't see anything going on at all! How can a horror film be scary when you can't even understand what's going on in it? Big disappointment here people. Not scary at all. No fun to watch. It's just boring!"
1,Huh?,"The real mystery here is how anybody could claim that this wild goose chase of a movie is frightening in the slightest.Very disappointing.It doesn't hold a bell, book, or candle to ""Paranormal Activity"", another far superior documentary-type horror film that actually IS scary...Another 90 minutes of my life completely wasted. Don't make the same mistake..."
1,This would be scary but...,"I went camping the same weekend after watching this. It did not effect me in any way. This would be scary but... I'm not the kind of person to get scared. Yes I can be shocked, freaked out, if a movie is suspencefull but this is not. Maybe watching it alone on a windy day in the forest would help, but otherwise this fails as a movie. Other movies WOULD be HORRIFIENG watched alone in the dark on a windy day in some cabin somewhere(LIKE SCREAM) It's the worst movie I have ever seen in the theatres. It probably would be kind of scary to some, I can understand why, but it wasn't effective to me."
1,DON'T BE SUCKED IN BY THE HYPE,"I had been anticipating this film for months after a friend of mine was in a test screening during the SXSW Film Fest. I waited in line three hours for tickets. Here's the real scoop. The creators of this film are ingenious. The way they organized and promoted this film is something that will be studied for years to come. But the movie itself is an utter disappointment. It is NOT scarier than 'The Exorcist.' It does NOT do for the woods what 'Jaws' did for the water. It's pretty much a theatrical version of MTV's 'The Real World' with a shoddy and slight supernatural spin on it. There were two things that were genuinely frightening about this movie: seeing just how many times the characters could use the word 'f**k,' and the realization that I wasted fifteen bucks and an hour and a half of my life on this movie. It's worth a rental so you can draw your own conclusions, but prepare to be disappointed."
1,horrible movie,"this movie is cheap yes, but cheap is everyway, from the camera angles to the actors ""screams"" please ppl ,do not get caught up in the hype. i did that and ended up wasting 2 hrs and $7 dollars!"
1,reminds me of childhood camping pranks,"this movie is just garbage it had good potential, was it suppose to be a comedy? or horror? there was nothing scary at all who ever saw this movie and got scared must be afraid of there own shadow. the documentary on the making was more entertaining then the movie. there also thinking about a sequel oh please just what we need more junk. the exorcist was 10 fold scarier.. 1/16 of a star should be the rating not 1 star."
1,5 Stars To The Ad Agency,"The real psychological terror conjured by this film school offering is that there are still people out in the world that truly believe this ""documentary"" to be in fact, real. It was 75 minutes of three people arguing and five minutes of skin crawling fear, that if elaborated upon could have made this one of the best psychological fright films of all time. What little background information that is offered doesn't even jive with the final scene. This movie will, however, be reviewed for decades to come in business schools around the world. It has to be one of the best marketed and hyped films in the last 10 years."
2,what a joke.,over-rated garbage. one star each for the two guys who made the film and cashed in BIG TIME on this trash.
1,The best comedy ever,"What was this? A comedy? Nothing was scary AT ALL! This was the worst waste of money I spent at a movie theater ever! You couldn't pay me to see this movie again. SORRY! Please don't waste your money, unless you are either a wuss or you like to laugh a lot."
2,Not a good movie,"I'm sorry but this is just not nearly as good as people want to believe. It's nauseating, pointless, unintelligent, and it is so uninvolving so that went the kids are finnally in danger they look happy to die. This movie was not scary, sure the ending was a litte creepy but thats about it. This doesn't hold a candle to horror classics like Halloween, Rosemary's Baby, or Carrie. A very unpleasant experience. At least The Haunting wasn't nauseating."
4,Beginning: Smooth. Middle: Good. Ending: Abrubt!,"This film is great for the budget that it was made with, and just as it gets good and scarryish..... It ends!!!!!!"
4,excellent screenwriting tool...,"Even if you hate this film, from a writing stand-point it's pure genius. Sure, most of it was admittedly improvised by the cast, but just the concept alone had people completely fooled. Because of the documentary format, the writers could take a very simple plot---the search for a mythical witch---and dupe people into believing that these people really did disappear searching for it. So again, love it or hate, you would-be screenwriters out there, this can be done again, just disguise well enough and you could be off to a good payday.[...]"
1,About as scary as an old boot...,"I don't know why this movie was praised by critics and movie-goers alike, as the only thing this film did for me was give me a slight case of motion sickness. This film WAS NOT SCARY IN THE LEAST. You want scary? Go watch the Exorcist, not shaky cam in the dark forest. I cannot believe people were proclaiming this as ""scariest movie ever"". Mass hypnosis and sly marketing are the only theories I can come up with to explain this movies success. Zero stars.Also, this movie isn't even original - watch ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" and replace Bigfoot with the ""Blair Witch"". Boggy Creek had this beat by 25 years!"
1,Are they kidding?,"I just finished watching this ""epitome of horror""-this scariest film since ""The Exorcist."" What I came away with was that either they were putting me on, or ( and here is the true scariest part about this film), they REALLY believe this was something worth putting on film. Either way, I truly do encourage you to see this so that you too can say, this is ""the WORST movie I have ever seen."" Believe me, you will be saying it for years to come."
1,AFV when it's worst,I'm afraid I don't share most viewers point of view when it comes to this movie - if that's what it is! I simply haven't seen such a terrible movie ever. I watched and waited for about 80 minutes for something to happen and all I got was a bad taste and a feeling of a few guys laughing their brains out while counting all the money they got for a great marketing campaign. I give it 1 star because I couldn't give it less - don't even think of watching it - your'll loose 80 minutes of your life while you can have more fun looking out the window on a rainy day!
1,"Absolute, utter TRASH....","I defy anyone to watch this film and not come away extremely irritated.A semi-original idea, but the film suffers from paper-thin, downright annoying characterisations, weak, melodramatic ""acting"", and an almost non existent plot.You gotta admire the hype machine, though."
3,It made some of the audience puke!.,"It would have been better if they kept the seceret of the real thing or the fake. It was good for a $30,000 movie and no grapics was cool, for once, but it was still good. I'm glad that they came out with a movie that is natural home video I hope that they nerver try to copy that kind of film making again with the motions"
1,Will make you sick,"No plot, No story, just a lot of film footage that is so unsteady it will make you physically sick."
2,definitely not the first rate,"Agree that acting was good, but the story (includes the ending) was pretty boring. Simply it isn't scary. This is not what one should pay to see at cinema. Classic ""Evil dead"" is ten times better."
4,Very intense ending!,"The first half of the film was a little slow, but funny. The movie started to become more intense near the end. By that time, we were on the edge of our seats. Not to mention a little motion sick."
1,STUPIDEST MOVIE ON THE PLANET!,"The Blair Witch Project was with out a doubt THE biggest waste of 2 hours ever! Like I really wanted to listen to a bunch of Whiney college brats tromp through the woods for 2 hours! How about learning to READ a MAP! WHINE, WHINE catfight, catfight Totally stupid!"
3,Too distracted to be scared..,"Even though I applaud the originality of the marketing and the movie itself, the three's CONSTANT bickering makes it very hard to be scared. I was so ready to kill them all myself (especially the girl) that it was a relief when they were quiet and scared and not yelling at each other. Oh well.. nobody asked me anyway."
5,Suspense Already..,"I live in Australia, so it comes out at the movie theatres in December, but I am looking forward to it so much. I can't believe people out there are putting it down. Use your imagination, fools. Would you be so level-headed if it was you out there, in the middle of the bush?"
5,"Creepy, disturbing, endlessly inventive","This really is a triumph of intelligent, imaginative film-making. In an era where 'horror' instantly brings self-referential irony and pathetic in-jokes, it's so refreshing to see a film that refuses to succumb to this. Instead, our minds are constantly attacked, both by the claustrophobic camera work and the constant, building terror. What disturbed me equally, however, was the reaction of the students, played with conviction by the young leads. I genuinely felt for them, and that made the haunting final image even more resonant. Those who didn't get the significance of that image should have listenened a little better earlier on in the film! In conclusion, a masterpiece."
4,I thought this was an excellent movie!!!,"I think this movie was well put together, It really makes you wonder. It is great."
4,"First movie to actually ""scare"" me!","I thought this movie was unexpectantly scary. Maybe it is because i watched it at the theater but i have never been as scared at a movie as i was on this one. I recommend this movie to people who like scary, creepy movies, but not to somebody who doesn't have the patience to wait for the action to take place, in this case the scary parts. The ending was not really good because it left us thinking. But i guess it was well thought because everyone comes up with their own conclusions."
2,What the hell was all that hype about?,"Well, yea it was a clevar way to film a movie i'll give them that, but why the hell did everyone think it was so scary? I actually found myself bored in a couple of parts. overall, it could have been better than everyone made it out to be."
1,Waste of time.,I can't believe all the attention this movie has received. It was stupid. I gave it a one star because there was no zero star to give.
2,"If u see it in theaters, that's enough","they lead you to believe this is the ""Shining"" or ""Halloween"" with its scares that are so subtle, they're invisible. the newly discovered footage was cut from the theatricl cut for a reason. and the PC interactive part of the dvd takes so long to load, it annoys you."
1,HUH?,WHAT? THIS A MOVIE? NAH. COULDNT BE. JUST A BUNCH OF KIDS RUNNING AROUND IN THE WOODS. I GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE THERE IS NO ZERO. EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO BACK TO SLEEP.
2,Ok as a student movie,"This was a great student movie, but the plot was too thin to hold any real interest after about 45 minutes. The main female character's voice is awful and annoying, and I was wishing death on her before the hour was up. It wasn't scary at all, and after about 30 minutes, I kind of hoped they'd hurry up and get killed so I could leave the theatre. Just not believable. Why didn't they just follow the river out of the woods? Rivers don't flow in circles folks. Who goes camping without at least a couple cartons of cigarettes? Why not start a forest fire. Those dolts deserved to die. Mildy enjoyable at best."
1,One of the worst movies ever,I hate only three movies I have ever seen. What I mean to say is not that i've seen all good movies but thats i've seen many mediocre movies which were not horrible. This is horrible! the other two are legally blonde and final stab. `nuff said
1,I really did not think the movie was worth watching.,It was not worth the time and effort the movie maker put in to it. The movie really never showed who or what took the three people and it really wasn't scary at all. Scream was better than the Blair Witch.
1,Review of the Blu Ray,I received an advance copy of the Blu Ray today and beware...this is 4:3 format and there is nothing high def about this film on blu ray. Stick to the DVD. I highly recommend High Tension and Hard Candy if you are a fan of either of those as the high def transfers are great!
1,blair witch project is very boring,"Bought the movie from a second-hand store because it said ""Scary As Hell"" on it. When I watch it for the first time, I was bored that I stopped the movie before it got to the middle so I have don't have to listen to all the boring interviews. I gave the movie to my sister and she said that the ending was scary. And all the people who got scared from watching the movie are wussies. And if you are thinking of getting this movie, you may as well attend a class with the most boring instructor teaching the most boring subject."
1,The Blair Witch Fiasco,"What an excruciating waste of time! I waited 90 minutes for something to frighten me. Then I realized that the most frightening thing about this film was the hype and all of the accolades heaped upon the writers/directors. You know a film is in trouble when within the first 35 minutes or so you are hoping that all of the main characters come to some gruesome end AND as soon as possible! Besides wasting time watching this film, the only thing I regret is that I have to give it at least one star in this review. Zero stars is not an option. Do yourself a favor and buy a Hitchcock video. ANY Hitchcock video. You will thank me later!"
1,"Not even bad enough to be good, but it was profitable...","Give Myrick and Sanchez credit. They found a gimmick that worked and milked it for a LOT of money. Like the inventors of the hoola hoop, the pet rock, and the web tailgate for pick up trucks, and, more specifically, Tom Lofton, they cashed in. P.T. Barnum would have been proud of them.This movie will probably go down as the ""Billy Jack"" of the 1990s. If you have not watched Billy Jack, watch it first before you consider watching Blair Witch Project.Essentially, this flick goes nowhere and takes 90 minutes to get there. Some say that one has to use one's imagination to really enjoy this movie. Maybe so, but not THAT much. If you find this movie frightening, you have lived a very sheltered life..."
1,Without a doubt the worst film ever made,"Scariest film ever made, my .... This film was boring as all hell and there were no shocks of any kind; everything that happened to the kids can be logically explained if you stop hyping the damn thing. No one stops and realizes that these kids were the stupidest beings ever to walk the planet and they deserved to die; nothing supernatural happened in that forest...like I said, everything is can be explained away very easily. This could have been set aside if there was any semblance of plot or suspense in the film, but that (as well as even halfway decent acting) is absent as well. All in all the worst film ever made; it doesn't even deserve one star."
1,"Good Concept, Bad Acting, Even Worse Dialogue","I give credit where it's due, but be for real. O.K, there's no doubt that the three who made the movie will go far in cinematography, but where was the scare in this movie? The only thing that TRULY SCARED me about the movie is the fact that it made so much in the theaters."
5,A Creative Spinoff From the Typical,"There must be something wrong with me because I wasn't as freaked out as my husband and some of the other reviewers. Blair Witch stuck with him for several days. At the time, there was a hot debate as to whether Blair Witch was a true story or a bunch of hype. That might've been what tripped me up.This movie was made creepy because those poor kids couldn't see their nemesis. But. They heard things. Saw the strange symbols surrounding their tent the next morning. Then the first victim had his gear stolen shortly before he disappeared.This isn't a horror movie, but an extreme psychological thriller. The beginning is somewhat interesting, if not a little boring. The middle is good. The ending will disturb you. Enjoy."
1,"Well, I'll admit that I purchased the thing used...",Maybe I'm cynical...but a movie about three college students going out into some woods and yelling at each oher? This is entertainment?
2,More humour than horror,"I recently watched this movie for the first time. From the moment I first heard about it years ago there was just something about it that made me think that it was no big deal--despite the mammoth hoopla surrounding it--and now I know that I was right. Not that I'm trying to be conceited, that's just the way it turned out. There was really nothing scarry about the movie, although I've come to wonder whether this has something to do with the unadulterated lampooning of the movie after it was released. Probably not though; it just doesn't seem to hit the right cords, and as a result I found myself laughing quite a bit throughout this thankfully short movie."
2,More power to them,"After all the hype, I was expecting something special, scary, or both. I was gravely disappointed. Throw in a great dane, a green van, some groovy music, and a spooky villain or two and you have something. Instead, I just saw a trio of hysterical idiots get lost in the woods and swear at each other. But hey, I wish I had the foresight to make a goofy horror movie in college and market it like they did. The pet rock of 90's cinema."
2,what a disappointment.,"Sheesh. Some kids go out into the woods with a camera and come back with what was, in almost all respects, a really lousy film. I'm all in favor of new cinematic styles, and I have faith that the rough-hewn home video will yield at least one great cinematic work in my lifetime, but this isn't it. It isn't scary. It isn't funny. It isn't pleasant to watch. Give me _The Exorcist_ any day."
5,-A way of not-seeing and believing!-,"This movie demonstrates a way of telling two different stories at the same time, and letting you imagine the rest. The filmmakers who made this movie had a sense and a way of scaring the people by putting them in place of the characters. And believe me, that is even scarier. It is a movie that can stay in your mind for a while, you digest it slowly, and think about every detail that you saw. The end is well planned, telling you what actually happened: 3 students, lost, this is what they filmed. I really liked this movie and it is worth the while."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"The Blair Witch Project was a movie that received an unnecessary amount of media attention because of its cinematography and originality. The movie is a little scary but the climax just didn't leave me satisfied. I knew, before coming into the theatre, that this movie was not real, so maybe that influenced my reaction to it. Anyways, if you haven't watched sixth sense yet, go see it and don't be in a rush to rent blair witch."
4,This movie is not only scary but freaky as well,"This is one of scary, sarcastic, and trill rides of the summer. I gave this movie for stars for it unike tuch of realism."
1,MTV's 'The Real World'... In a Forest!,"I wanted to like this movie. For $80,000, this was a bad production; especially since the noises they kept hearing at night (a rather major plot element) would have been SOOO much more effective if I could have actually heard them at all clearly, a problem easily corrected in post-production by the most novice of editors.Dramatic license (a 5-day camcorder battery), obvious oversights (GPS anyone), and at times hammy over-acting bothered me beyond the fact the movie continually gave me flashbacks to my college video production class."
3,Some what believable.,"I thought that this was very well constructed considering that the actors, directors, etc. were novices. The only draw back that I felt, was the language that came out of their mouths. Is it really necessary to show ones lack of knowledge or apt stupidity with the word F_ _ _ being used in todays vocabulary like a craved candy bar."
1,Not enough substance to carry the Hype!,"The only worthwhile scenes are very short and at the end of the movie. I worked at a video store and couldn't believe all the ""gossip"" about the movie being real! Still? Wait until it becomes a .99 cent rental then try it! BOO! There, I just gave a bigger scare than the whole movie! Stick to the original ""Halloween"" for a good flick!"
1,a waste of money,"My husband and I have a collection of numerous types of movies and this one will not be added to it. It was not, by any means, scary! The language could have used some cleaning up. It was by far the worst movie we have ever seen and it was the biggest waste of money. We definitely won't make our collection."
1,I spent the worst $5.50 of my life to see this!,"This was like, the pukiest movie I have ever seen!! I can't believe anyone would belive that it was real or that they'd think it was scary! The only scary thing about it was that it was actully made and that people would see it more than once. The idea was decent, but it wasn't acted at all right. And it shouldn't have been put out that it was fake, b/c then people went to see it and knew it was totally bogus. I will say the directors did a good job with setting up the woods to look like it was real, but again, it wasn't acted right at all..."
1,my rate would be negative 4 if it was possible..,"This movie was not a quarter as good as everybody says it was. I rented it because I expectet a scary horror movie, but noooo >_>First of, they are affrait of EVERYTHING (even stones and sticks). Secondly its not scary to see 3 dorks who get each other in the way be scared all night because of some noises...and thirdlt the ending was just plain idiotic: (Soilers) they start to scream like crazy (dont ask me why) and the camera falls to the floor, interessting, isn't it? o_OMay I add that the F-Word is a huge part of theyr vocabulary? Every sentence contains at least 5 F-words, its not even funny....I dont, and i mean DONT like this movie and never will."
3,would not know,Never saw it or care to. Just not my kind of movie though I know many that love it. I bought it as a gift for one of those. I can say it made a very good gift.
2,Wha.....?,"I'm sure by now, most of the people reading this have seen The Blair Witch Project. I've gotten mixed reviews, so I decided to go give it a shot, only to discover that this is the most blatant waste of time and money I have EVER seen. I think about the only thing good about it was the semi-decent ending (and even that wasn't too good). I just kept wanting to slap those idiots in the head for being so stupid... Number One: You don't kick you map into the river. Number Two: If you find a river while lost and hiking, you don't walk away from it, you follow it, and Number Three: If you don't use a compass (which you always should while in an area you don't know!), YES OF COURSE you will walk in a gigantic 15-hour circle. It wasn't scary, it wasn't well written, and I just think anyone who hasn't seen it shouldn't waste their time and go rent/watch the 1945 version of The Picture of Dorian Gray... Now THAT'S a horror flick!"
3,A good attempt.,"This film is a really good result of the producer's attempt to make the film succeed despite its very low budget! The concept is really good, realistic and this is the reason it succeeded in theatres! The three young actors are really good and the end is really terrifying if and only if you pay great attention to the opening interviews! The sounds in the forest as well as the screams of the female protagonist are the elements that make it special. Generally, I believe that it is much different than other thrillers, which has nothing to envy from big productions that haven't had a box-office success! A really risky attempt from the producer, which succeded and offered rhe audience this not so often-to-find production! Worth to spend some time watching it!"
1,"How does ""RETARDED"" sound?","Oh, BOO HOO HOO! My wife and I looked at each other during the film, wondering when it was going to GET scary. I really hate to start bursting bubbles, but if this scares you, please stay away from all haunted houses, because if you actually believe in a movie like this, then you will fall for anything!Personally, I believe in Jesus. My relationship with Him blows me out of the water. Not some stupid movie with the F word all the time.Gimme a break!"
1,How bad can a movie get??,"If you want an answer to that question, just try to sit through this one. This film occupies a prominent place on my list of the ten worst movies ever made. The only thing remotely scary about it was that so many people were actually deluded into thinking it was worth the price of admission. Lemme see now... three totally obnoxious, foul-mouth college kids traipse off into deepest Maryland (I'm cracking up just typing this) looking for signs of some kind of local witch. They manage to lose themselves in the woods by a river, yet (did it ever occur to these bozos that if they followed the river they were sure to come to a populated area?) and are never seen again. Don't we wish. They actually came back and made a sequel to this mishmash! On a scale of one to five I'd give this mess a minus-ten, but the review rules say I have to give it at least one star, so I will grudgingly shell out one. And people actually paid to see this?!!?"
1,A waste of time,"I think everyone made too much of a big deal out of this movie, I really think it is a waste of time. I wasn't going to watch it in the first place but my friend saw the previews and decided it's THE scariest movie and we should all go watch it. I would usually step out of a movie feeling like i'm in a dream or something, still reviewing all the scenes in my mind but this time I left feeling stupid for paying money for it. It's true that the way they did it- Making the actors face certain situations without knowing about them earlier- and by that acting 'for real'- Is definitely a cool way of doing it, but still overall- I don't think it's worth anyone's time and attention."
3,to much hype,"i was very disappointed with the movie, mainly because of all the hype and stories i heard before actually seeing the movie. i do have to admit it was a very original idea and a good one at that. although i still say it was not scary enough for me."
1,The Blair Witch Project,This was a very silly movie. I was not all scared! I don't know what all the hoopla was about....It was just silly! I wouldn't even give it one star!
1,THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,"WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS FILM,WELL FIRSTLY IT SHOULD HAVE STAYED AS A PROJECT INSTEAD OF MAKING IT ONTO THE BIG SCREEN.WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY.IT SHOULD BE BURIED IN A WOOD AND LEFT THERE."
1,Why the hype?,"I don't get why people like this movie so much.... The majority is in the woods with a girl and two girls and they just talk to each other and are in the woods forever.... Gee, creative. \If it's not boring it gets to the dumbest parts, like the dumb videotape part and the staircase thing. This isn't original. I'm happy I haven't seen the sequel."
3,fear of the unknown,"There's no doubt that this film has successfully got to that part in our minds where we fear the unknown,and although there were no special effects whatsoever,no music,and most important no proper cameras,it has succeeded in scaring the living daylight out of us.the ending,however,was a tottal disappointment,i do agree whith what some may call""an open ending"" but in the blair whitch project i don't have any other words but unsuccessful,which degraded the intire film."
3,excessive argument and a disconcerting end,"I can only say that hype and expectations aside, I was basically annoyed by the extended arguments. I realize that such arguments would take place in a situation like that, but I couldn't stand the couple of incidences where they argued about turning the camera off and one of the guys rushed her.Was registered some fear was that there although this is a mock documentary, there really are sick murderers out there (just look at the True Crime section of your local bookstore). I was unnerved by the last few seconds of the film- Mike standing in the corner, his back to us, and Heather falling on the ground. I can't even begin to imagine what it must feel like for someone to make you face away in a corner while he murdered your friend, knowing that you were next.That's real fear."
3,A suspenseful journey that leads to a dissappointing ending.,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way to the ending. This movie has a way of holding your attention for over an hour. Only to show you very little at the end. But the movie did do one thing,it left itself open for a awesome sequel."
5,Genuinely scary,"Rarely does a film create an atmospere that the viewer can find as believable as the blair witch project. The ""amateur"" filming along with the superb acting by three unknowns worked to create one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever viewed. It is the work of pure genuis and if you view it as otherwise you probably missed the idea all along. The unknown is far more frightening than the known. Unbelievably good. Five stars plus."
3,"Suspenseful, but not too scary...","I thought that the movie was semi-decent. The first time I saw it, I was scared. I went a second time to analyze it properly, and I concluded that it was only worth 3 stars. I felt like I was watching an extra-long episode of ""The Real World"" on MTV. There were only two scary parts in the whole film, and only one if you didn't pay attention to the interviews at the beginning of the film..."
1,This is a lousy movie...that about sums it up!,"This has got to be the worst movie that I've paid to see in a long, long time. How this movie got the hype it did, I will never, ever know. Do not waste your money on it. Talk about going in circles? I wondered if it would ever end, and when it did I was so glad...too bad I found out too late and wasted my hard-earned cash...save your money and your time, and find something else better (which will not be too hard)"
3,The Blair Witch Project - True or False,This is an great movie to watch if you really believe in witches and ghost. Got me shaken that's for sure. If you knew what really happen it sort of spoiled the whole story. Gives me the goose bumps just talking about it. Its okay I guess.
5,INTENSE,"I thought the movie was very realistic. I was reading how alot of people said that it was far fetched. These were scenes like,the jokemaking,delayed reactions to fear,running and screaming like crazy. These three people to me were very genuine. you could tell by the end of the movie they were sick of being scared,they were now on there way to losing there minds. Totally worth seeing."
2,NOT SCARY!,"DIDN'T SEE THIS FILM IN THE THEATRES WHEN IT WAS RELEASED! WATCHED IT ON DVD WHEN IT WAS RELEASED,I SAT THROUGH THE MOST FRUSTRATING PIECE OF CRAP,I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WAS MADE INTO MAKING THIS FILM OR HOW MUCH THEY PAID THESE YOUNG UNKNOWN ACTORS BUT IT'S NOTHING THAT SAYS ""I WAS AFRAID TO WATCH THIS OR IT SCARED ME"" PLUS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF DOING A SO-CALLED SEQUEL WHEN ALSO ANOTHER PIECE OF CRAP! NOW THERE'S A MOVIE JUST RELEASED IN THE THEATRES CALLED ""THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" WHICH SOME CRITICS ARE COMPARING TO ""THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"",HAVEN'T SEEN IT BUT I'M SKEPTICAL,HOLLYWOOD IS BEGINNING TO MAKE CRAPPY SCARY MOVIES JUST MAKE MONEY AND DRAW AUDIENCES!"
1,Total [Waste]!,"The Blair Witch Project is the worst film I have ever witnessed. It received glowing reviews from critics so I decided to check it out. I was prepared for a really great film - I was wrong.I waited and waited for something interesting to happen but the film just kept on dragging along with nothing even remotely interesting happening at all. Then it ended. I was so annoyed that I didnt even attempt to watch it a second time.Avoid this one. ....I don't usually criticize a horror film coz I like most of them, even ones that are truly aweful but this film is terrible.It's not a horror film, it's a film designed to bore the hell out of you. Take my advice - avoid this film at all costs."
2,"Obvious, unsatisfying, boring, predictable. I'm sorry. :(","First, let me say I didn't experience any of the hype. I know you can't believe it, but I missed it. I was dragged to this movie with a friend who was ribbing me the whole way, ""You've never HEARD of this movie? You've never HEARD OF IT???"" He filled me in as we went, but when the movie started I only knew it was supposed to be ""really scary"" and that people had left the theatre rather than endure the horror.I was braced. But it was a joke. A parody. It had to be. I sort of laughed and nudged my friend, but just like everyone else in the audience, he was taking it dead seriously. So I kept quiet.I found the premise and the ""handy-cam"" photography tedious and felt a little sick to know how many budding students of cinema art had their work trashed when these guys succeeded. The whole phenomenon is ludicrous.Maybe if I had been injected by the hype, I would have had some context in which to appreciate this film."
1,the scariest parts were shown on tv for free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this was so ridiculos and lame,it wound up being a comedy.the audience were laughing their heads off.until they realized they paid for this crap!!!!!then the water works began.i had a feeling this was a product of some very clever marketing.and to be honest,i really did want to enjoy this.it was original for the most part,it didnt have any rappers(A HUGE PLUS!!!!!!)and it was supposed to be the most frightening film out.i was very much willing to dish out $... for this.but like i said up top,i saw the best parts on tv.i knew the movie was gonna get bashed,the producers knew this was gonna get bashed.i could see all of the spoofs before they happened.and what do all involved go and do?MAKE AN EVEN LAMER SEQUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS FRANCHISE DIED A QUICK AND VERY ENJOYABLE DEATH!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,not worth the time investment,"I have to go with the other reviewers who have described this as a boring, tedious film where not much of anything really happens. The only scary part was at the very end, and even that leaves you scratching your head wondering what happened. The concept for the movie was original, so you have to give them credit for that. But it just wasn't as frightening as the filmmakers thought it would be or as the hype led me to believe. I found it silly and annoying, particularly the never ending use of the f-word, the s-word, etc. These kids should have been bright enough to come up with better dialogue than that. But the main thing is it just wasn't that scary. If they had shown some kind of menacing figure off in the distance, a shadow, just SOME kind of tangible evidence of some creepy witch or other bogeyman, it would have been much scarier. Little piles of rocks and stick figures just aren't very scary."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,So many people think this movie wasn't good. I liked it because there were no special effects. This made it look very realistic. Now a days people expect dazzling special effects throughout the entire movie. When this came out and they saw that there were no special effects it disappointed them. I LOVED IT!
3,Maybe in silence?,"After all the hype people made about this movie, I was expecting something truly horrifying and seriously creepy. That wasn't the case for me. I think a big part of it was that the movie-theater atmosphere was missing. Instead of a big, dark and silent room with other people equally entranced...I was in a semi-well-lit condo near a busy street with neighbors thumping around. I couldn't hear the ""voices"" that kept surrounding the tent. I'm willing to give this one another shot after a while but my first experience with the film wasn't quite as fabulous as most people claimed."
2,Some of the Worst Flaws of the Movie,"Among other things, one of the worst lines of dialogue in the movie was when one of the characters proclaimed, ""I found some cigarettes in the bottom of my backpack. That mean's we're still alive, because we're smoking!""Also, these people were supposedly stuck in the woods for about a week, but they somehow managed to have enough battery power, without recharging, to keep their camcorders and flashlights going during the entire duration. How on earth did they manage that?"
1,I'll spare you the trouble...,"This is the worst low budget film ever made. Seriously, my recent Hi-8 of a family picnic where the dog jumped onto the table and stole a hamburger is scarier and has better production values than this lame excuse for a horror movie. People get lost in the woods, they gradually disappear, something vaguely scary is going on but the camera doesn't hold still long enough to catch anything. You know when you roll down a hill in a trash can and then try to walk? Imagine you're holding a camera while doing that. That and hearing ambiguous evil sounds like ""the owl, the mongoose, or the washing machine whirr kind of altered to sound kind of creepy."" Cinematography aside (far aside), Casting was done very well, if the goal of the film was to pick people who the audience wanted to see summarily killed by the end of the film. In that case, awesome choices. [applause]."
1,good marketing can sell anything,"I'd heard about this film snd read about it online etc and it sounded like a really good idea and i was excited about seeing it. 5 minutes into the film however and i felt digusted by the way i had been conned into paying to watch this ""movie"". I kept waiting for something remotely scary, but before i found that the credits went up, what a relief. The phrase ""its what you dont see that scares you"" is just an excuse for having no budget. I think lots of people gave this move good review for the simple reason that its not a mainstream hollywood film, regardless of whether it was any good or not. Too be scard by this film i think you would have to be the sort of person who got terrified by your next door neighbour coughinh at night, this film really is dreadful. i would reccomend that you dont wasted your money on seeing this film, rent somethong scarier, like the rugrats movie!"
1,Scooby Doo was scarier than this! That's pretty bad!!,"I was so dissapointed in this movie. I was looking forward to it and when I finally got to see it, I wasn't scared at all. I don't understand how people have gotten so scared."
5,really good,Not as scary as you expect but still scary enough. leaves a lot to the imangination. A must watch movie.
1,The STUPID blair witch project,"Don't waste your money on this movie! It didn't have a story, it didn't have gore, and over-all it wasn't scary! It was defenitly not a horror flick! The only thing this movie had was language! I don't think I have ever heard someone say the f-word so many times in such a short movie."
2,"a pretty good idea, just wasn't that scary","I saw this movie on its opening weekend before the wide-release and way before all the hype set in, so I can't blame that. I expected to be scared senseless, though. And I wasn't. It was creepier to think about afterwards than it was to watch it. Too much arguing. Too much whining. And a couple of pretty big gaps in the logic. I've never met anyone who throws away a map because they're lost. I just didn't buy it. However, if I was convinced going in that this was a true documentary and that this actually occured, then it would have the potential to be the scariest movie ever made, simply because it would be like a true snuff film. But it's not, and it never seemed like it was."
1,Don't Believe the Hype!!,"I guess I expected too much. What we have here is a girl running thru the woods, screaming. That's basically it. If that scares you, then go for it. And the 'fighting' is just so phoney. Anyone scared by this film is probably scared by their own shadow. A big disappointment."
5,Great Movie!,The first time I seen this movie was on Lifetime.I really enjoyed it.All my friends borrowed the dvd and all said that they cried during the movie.It is really a touching movie.
3,I do enjoy it!,"This is a great cleanser. First off, it foams but is free of sulfates. I have suffered from a sulfate foaming cleanser years ago by Clean & Clear. I decided to give this one a try. It cleans well, my pores have minimized some. It also gives my face a nice radiance. The smell is not for everyone, only if you perfer a herb, earth smell. However, it doesn't smell chemical laden like less natural cleansers.My skin is oily, but this keeps it managed. Overall, this lovely lavender cleanser agrees with my skin and I like using it."
4,Best of RJ Review,"Having already read these four books and enjoyed them all, the tapes were also very good. The books were fantastic but, i could not read while i drove or did certain other tasks that required my eyes and hands now that is taken care of. I can now do just about anything and enjoy these great books. So, i do recommend reading the books but, if your a person on the go then this collection on tape is a fantastic substitute."
4,Pretty silly,"I read this book to my four year old. Most of it went past him. My 10,11, and 16 year old thought it was pretty funny. This book is probably best for 6-8 year olds."
1,Gibberish,"This is undoubtably the worst childrens book I have ever seen. Why would you want to expose your children to utter nonsense. This book is akin to encouraging your child to speak ""baby talk""."
4,An Important Film,"Just finished watching this documentary and said to myself, "" What a must see film for high school students on Earth Day"". Yes, besides our wildlife, there are cultures endangered so we REALLY ARE ALL CONNECTED. Julian thank you for getting this project done. Students today must look beyond the walls of their classrooms.The only reason for a 4 and not 5 star was it was a little too long - the message was there and I imagined about five times a perfect ending scene . Yes, the ""white feather"" ((SEE THE FILM)) is watching over the earth and all its people. Peace, John and thank you Julian."
4,Another 2 our of 3 Disk,"It seems that most of the Muppets disks are 2 out of 3 affairs- 2 good or great episodes, and one mediocre one. Sellers and Cleese are fabulous- the Sellers episode alone is worth getting the disk- but the Moore episode is just kind of flat, and his numbers aren't very interesting.I have not had the disk problems that other reviewers seem to have. The audio on my disks is fine, and they play fine.It is a shame that there isn't more ""bonus material"" on these disks, considering the price; they could be great ads for modern Muppet projects."
5,Muppet Show with Dudley Moore,You can STILL enjoy those great entertainers of yesterday when you watch ANY of the Muppet SHow VIDEOS! EVERYONE loves the muppets!!!!!
3,looks kinda sketchy...,"i really dont know how i feel about this expansion pack. Oh, but no doubt am i going to buy it! I am a huge sims fan. But the whole expansion pack is growing real tiresome. And plus with all the excitement of the sims 2 coming, this expansion is coming off like nothing to me. Just another way to make more money...even more so. Plus, it doesnt seem like it can compare to the sims 2. I think this would be one expansion I can wait for..."
1,Makin' Magic in the treasury at Maxis,"I am a big fan of the Sims and own all of the expansion packs. All of them have had success and has added something very unique to the game. The Sims: Makin' Magic Expansion pack is supposedly the last of the Sims, that is, until the Sims 2 is due to release March 15, 2004. I had wished that Maxis' last addition would be the use of cars, bikes, and motorcycles. To me, this last expansion seems like Maxis' afterthought before they come out with Sims 2, which they are promoting a lot. Makin' Magic does not appeal to me because there is already magic in some current expansions. Maxis should be reducing the price of this expansion since it doesn't deserve to be called one."
3,Good-Bye Old Sims,It's a sad day knowing this is the last expansion for the old sims we all enjoyed.It's also a chance for Electronic Arts to squeeze the oldies for one last dollar.They should have gone with a better farewell expansion.
1,i wouldn't waste money,"with the sims 2 coming in about 3 monthes, why waste hard earned money (or not) on the primitive game?"
3,It's okay,I got this game for my birthday it was great then after a while it started to get less and less interesting but maybe my prefrences have changed oh well it a cool game though
3,Installing,There is no problem using the software for XP. The x86 software in Windows 7 does not recognize the 32 bit CD in installing. I am using WIN 7 64 bit.
2,"Very, very old paperback","I expected a used paperback but not one from 1970--that's a 40 year old paperback and it has the teeny, tiny print. Would not recommend this company to anyone."
2,Dissapointed,I am kinda disappointed by the book. I thought the book would be colored with lot of picture and description. It has all the description but no color and pictures. So its not interesting to read it and use it.
5,Wow,"I'm a new mom, working full time, who barely knew how to cook a few plain items. I got this cookbook from my Dad for Christmas, and it is amazing! Not only are the recipes simple and wonderful, but I even have time to make dinner while the baby plays in his bouncy seat! From Chili to Pesto ""fried"" chicken, to Cornmuffinwiches, both my husband and I LOVE this book! I even made my first bread from scratch and it only took maybe 15 minutes. It also seems to be compatible with the South Beach Diet, which I've been on for three weeks (down 10 lbs!)"
3,The front part of this shoes is weak!,"I bought this shoes for my boy who is playing tennis.He likes the color, design and the comfortable feeling in it in his playing tennis.But, only after a few weeks, I found the front part of the shoes is worn and has a hole.I think it might be because of the weakness of the front part."
5,adidas mens stan smith hardware IV,I always were these shoes but are getting hard to find so I bought 2 pair this time
2,"Hornby's ""How to be Good""","Hornby should not be criticized for trying to step out of the self-referential box he's written himself into in the past. However, this book did little to move or deeply amuse me the way About a Boy and High Fidelity did. How to be Good is an intense and controversial social commentary; it also possesses a finely crafted plot with some hilarious moments, mostly involving children and infidelity. But, I just don't think Hornby has mastered the art of writing from the female point of view."
2,Missing that Hornby flair,"Having been a Hornby fan for quite sometime, I snapped this up when it first came out and was eager to tear into it! The story is, conceptually, very intriguing, and starts off in true Hornby fashion, a delightful read. However, as the plot winds on, the story and the concept fall flat. I had to force myself through to the end, and was left very disappointed.Of course, I will most certainly read whatever he puts out next. Besides, everyone deserves a good flop now and then. Kudos for the effort, and high hopes that what is to follow far surpasses this one!"
2,Don't judge Hornby by this book alone,I'd hate to think that this could be someone's first time reading a book by Nick Hornby because I doubt they would give his other much better books a chance. For about 3/4 of the book I just felt annoyed at all of the characters. Do yourself a favor and check out Fever Pitch or High Fidelity instead.
3,Worth reading but ...,"How To Be Good has all the makings of a great book. I think it hits on, in a humorous and quirky way, how a lot of women feel after 20 years marriage. It was outrageous in parts, but Hornsby pulls it off. He is a talented writer. I would highly recommend this to be read by every psychology 101 student - he captures the depressed mind/personality perfectly and in different ways in each character.Now...the reason I only gave it 3 stars... I am a tough critic and this book has some flaws. If he was a first time novelist, I would give it a 4 star. But Hornsby has the ability to do better. He misses the mark in a few places and leaves me feeling unsatisfied.(I guess that is the word.) In the beginning of the book the husband and wife have personality - passion, anger and conflict. By the end they are dull and with little emotion. One version of depression to another. With so much happening in between why not change them?"
3,Entertaining but not Hornby's best,"Quick review: it had some funny moments but was more down and less upbeat than Hornby's previous novels. While Hornby addresses issues beyond relationships this time, he loses some of the spark that was in his other novels. Unfortunately Hornby seems to be better at humor than writing about social problems in G.B. and the Western world. On the other hand, there ARE quite a few parts that made me laugh and I smiled plenty of times- just not as much as I did while reading High Fidelity and About a Boy."
1,Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes....zzz.....,"First, she (the book's character) wanted a divorce.But the husband said, ""No"". Then she tried again;and he still refused. Later on, when the kids askedif there was a divorce brewing, and the husbandsaid, ""Maybe"". And she got annoyed with him forhis acknowledgement. So he agreed to the divorce;but she said she didn't want one after all.OH-MY-GOD! I was already at Chapter 4 andthis ding-donging was still going on. By then,I've already made up my mind: I parted ways withthe book and moved on."
2,How to be a boring book...,"This was a very dry, yet easy read. I have to admit I finished this book because I was hoping that the author's past performance would shine through. It didn't and I was disappointed. I read High Fidelity and About a Boy both before they were slated to be movies and I absolutely loved them. I've underlined sections of each book that were particularly profound. Each chapter of HTBG was like the one before. The characters weren't very interesting. Their problems seemed contrived. Their involvement was bland. To sum this book up in one word, Boring."
2,fantastic topic but a bit disappointing,"Nick Hornby's previous novels were very entertaining. When I read the blurb of this one, I couldn't wait to read it. The theme is very exciting and thought-provoking. However, I found it a bit slow in parts, and jerky in others. I particularly found the character of GoodNews believable and likeable, but he, too, petered out towards the end. However, I must admit that there were 3 places where I really did laugh out loud. Not great literature but a pleasant read."
5,Makes me want to be good... or at least better,"Nick Hornby is quickly becoming my favorite author. I loved ""A Long Way Down"" and ""About a Boy."" I don't know which is my favorite, but ""How to Be Good"" is every bit as good as the others.It's painful in its accuracy of the internal conflict every person faces when debating living comfortably vs. helping those in need. One can't help but identify with the seriously flawed narrator, while seeing all those flaws up close, personal, and in glowing neon lights.I'm not being in any way facetious when I say that this novel does make me want to be a better person while still arguing all the reasons why maybe I shouldn't be. Or should be. Or shouldn't... It's a poignant and thought-provoking novel that leaves its reader with a bittersweet aftertaste. Fantastic!"
2,Nagging message spoils story,"Although I like Hornby's work in general, I was dissapointed by this book. Okay, sometimes it's funny, sometimes I could even identify with the characters or the situation, but all the time I was irritated by a nagging mosquito who was trying to deliver a message. The message is, I guess, that it is not easy to have a clear conscience and that we are all only human and should try to make peace in our own home and family first. Not an earthshaking revelation for me. And as this message is already Very Clear after the first two chapters, I kept hoping for an interesting new turn of thought, but alas, none came."
2,What a disappointment!,"Definitely buy and read ""About a Boy"" and ""High Fidelity"", but give this one a pass. It's awkward, boring and tough to get through. The characters are ridiculous caricatures, whereas the characters in Nick Hornby's earlier novels were wonderfully real. What a disappointment."
2,Depressing Read,"The book is very pessimistic, and the characters are very unlikable. I kept hoping for an upbeat twist to the story - and it never came. You really want to grab the characters off of the page and shake them and scream ""DO YOU HAVE NO PRIDE, SHAME, OR BALLS?!?!?!?!"""
2,If you want to read just for the sake of reading...,"This book is a quick read but there's no point in reading this book if you're looking for a ""good"" book. You may as well read the newspaper, a brochure or magazine instead. This book contains the inner thoughts of a whiney wife the whole time. You read to escape reality so you don't have to be in your head, but no worries you can be in someone else's annoying head. Fun. I urge you not even to read this book to find out for yourself. Yes it will go quick but it will leave you unsatisfied like watching 8 hours of tv straight on a Saturday..."
5,How to ... be hooked !,"You are young, you get married, you have children, arguments and sexual chemistry together ...and the years go by...How to be Good ...is the story of any couple, and reading it gave me chills down my spine because it was so damnably relatable! When the romance gives way to reality and the business of making a marriage work, no author could have done it better. There is no constant in life but change and the novel depicts this beautifully. What is frankly more amazing is how a middle aged male author could get into the mind of a female protagonist so well, so lucidly and so insightfully...Nick Hornby must be having a lot of meaningful conversations with REAL wome, real wives, real mothers...no wonder this book is the product of that !"
2,How to be Mediocre,"This is the first Nick Hornby's book I've read, and even though I'm giving this book 2 stars...it won't be my last Nick Hornby book. I say this because ultimately Hornby's a funny writer (with better material out there) and ""How To Be Good"" starts off like a charm; a middle age man confronts his selfish consuming vain ways, with the help of bum/guru, and tries to make the world a better place, even if that means making his family miserable. In curious form, the narrator is the man's wife.Over the course of the book, what starts off like a sure fire concept seems to get muddled and confused. Slowed down by Hornby's love of pop culture references, the book wades though social experiments like Adopt a Bum that arn't funny, end up being too predictable, and go nowhere. In the end, the family grows to appreciate each other but it was too little too late for me."
2,Disappointing,I agree with the reviewer who states that the book raises a lot of issues surrounding the choices one must make in a middle-class existence but shrugs them off before really resolving them.
2,Exciting?,"I borrowed this ebook from the library thinking it had action, adventure and two lovers finding their way back to each other. Maybe the book just starts slow but I got to page 117 and the only action is Merlyn faking his death.Ysabella goes on and on, repeatedly, about how terrible Merlyn is, how he tricked her. Her reason for leaving him revolves around how pious she is but she makes the most of her reputation as a witch. At this point in the book she is not a very likable character and I can't bring myself to listen or read more.I think I could really like Merlyn for all that he is a deceitful devil. I want to know more about his side of things instead of the constant harping from her.The action has to increase as the plot moves on but waiting well over a third of the book is too long for me."
3,first time using it,"i just got this product in the mail and have used it once so far. so, as of my first use i like it. there is just enough texture in the scrub to feel like its doing something(and it is) without hurting your skin. i think it works for sensitive skin...my skin is kind of sensative and a little acne prone, but i have not had a break out with this product. this product doesn't leave a yucky film behind when i rinse it off.its also easy to rinse off. a little goes a long way. i think i might have used to much the first time. i would only use this 3 time a week. just because i don't want to over scrub or irritate my skin. i'm just giving it a three star because i haven't used it enough."
1,new formula sucks!,"This product has been ruined. Beware! The item pictured and described is the old formula, which was a great product. I've used it for years. The new one arrived, with a different label, and wow, it's no good. My face immediately felt dry and stretched and in the morning there was a residue on my skin that I could not wait to wash off. So sad. Guess I'm looking for a new moisturizer. Shame on Avalon Organics for messing with a good thing!"
3,A simple but unconvincing theory,"A well written if heavily padded book which is based on a simple premise, that a Secret Service agent in the backup car stumbled and had a Negligent Discharge of his AR15, hitting JFK in the back of the head. Menninger tells the story of how a weapons expert rationalised this theory based not on eyewitness testimony but on a study of wounds and ballistics. However, the presence of the rifle is not a new discovery - it is mentioned in the Warren Report - and the author weakens his case by assuming Oswald's guilt. Overall, a worthwhile read but unlikely to contribute to serious debate on the assassination"
4,Read it,Strange enough to be more likely than the normal 'truth' books.The details used to argue the case are worth a read in their own right
1,this game just sucks the worst game ever get another game,you cant control elevation and it is unrealistic the graphics are the only good part and more options are okay but it could have been way better.I like harry potter and the other harry potter games but this 1 just really sucks so use your 30 dollars on something else such as need for speed underground
5,Great,Wonderful movie deserving of Blu ray. I hope to see their entire collection moved to this format. Would especially like the pirates who don't do anything on blu ray.
3,Fun but a little too silly,"I love the veggie tales movies and this one is a good one but not great. First, the music is wonderful. They really did a great job with music, esp. the gospel song from inside the whale. However, some of the story is just a little too weird for me--esp. with the fish slapping people. I felt that at times that they were shoving things in just to justify this being a full length movie."
5,5 + STARS,"This is one of my favorites (a classic) the more you listen the better it gets. The band is as tight as it get's, very strong as you listen you wait for a bad tune there is not one. The guitar is excellent as for the horns, which I am not real big on can't be matched. The vocals are awesome I can't get enough of this one. I have over 1,000 blues cd's and this is a real stand out. I have 8 of his cd's this is my favorite, just buy it you will be amazed. Also it is over an hour of pure heavy rocking blues live in Germany."
3,Still not impressed,"I have been reading ultimate X-Men since its beginnings. It was a fun and enjoyable book up until the New Mutant arc. Since then the series has dropped the ball and it still hasn't recovered. It is an all right arc, but the annual is a must read. I suggest getting the book only because it is on sale for about 9 bucks and the annual will now cost you about 5 to 6 dollars."
2,Not the best ribbon cutter,"I am not impressed with this cutter. While it looks like it would work great, I've found that it's hard to maintain a straight line and that it does not cut cleanly. When I press harder it wobbles. Not great"
5,"Rich, Smart, and Entertaining","A family member just sent me this novel for my birthday; said it was perfect my trip to the Maine coast. It was -- but that doesn't really describe the full experience. Thoroughly engrossing, an intelligent, emotionally satisfying page-turner.Highly recommended for your vacation reading (the atmospheric seaside setting is an extra value.)"
1,This is not a good camera,"We bought this camera 1-1/2 years ago. It was being discontinued and we got it for what we thought was a good deal. We very quickly learned that the pictures come out very dark, sometime almost black. Not just indoors either, pictures taken outside are very dark too. Videos are quite difficult to see when playing back. About a week ago, the camera died completely. We've always been very careful with our camera and have never dropped it or anything. The screen doesn't work and we can't take pictures now. I suppose it's a good thing because now we can actually get a good camera."
4,Great great if you have realistic expectations,"I bought the Optio S and quickly returned it as I was really disappointed by the photo quality. But I loved the features so I thought I'd give Pentax one more shot (pardon the pun). The Optio S40 really fits the bill for what I wanted; a compact digital camera that I can carry with me when my Minolta A1 is to cumbersome that would produce reasonably nice prints. The S40 can be a little picky at full telephoto but otherwise it seems to perform very well and quick too. I'm sure once I learn about this model's capabilities I will be even more pleased with my purchase. At $100 bucks less than Canon's S410, it's a real bargain. By the way, if you are comparing this model to the Minolta Xg, don't bother. The Xg was an even bigger disappointment that the Optio S. Happy Shooting!"
4,Golden Age mystery is a fun read,"It's a year or so before America enters World War II, and Los Angeles private detective Fergus O'Breen is called on to investigate a mysterious death. Lots of references to cards (playing and tarot) and adherence to the structure of the classic puzzle mystery make this a good choice for a light read."
2,Poorly organized and too academic,I got this book because I'm going on vacation in Turkey soon and wanted to learn about it's history. I was quickly turned off by the academic nature of the writing and the poor organization. I'll admit I didn't get very far.
4,A Varied Collection,"Key West Tales is a delightful assortment of short stories by John Hersey, 15 in total. The stories are set from anywhere from the Civil War to the present, with the stories being just as varied. You will read about a dying AIDS patient, the Confederacy's president Jefferson Davis returning after imprisonment, an avid bird hunter's visit to Key West, and many more. Although one might hope for more dramatic endings, that is a shortcoming that is quickly remedied by Hersey's style, and the flow and ease that the tale is written. This is a quick read, but something you will want to read time and time again."
1,Can I give it 0 stars?,"What the hell was this? I think this has got to be one of the most boring books on the planet. I was looking forward to some short stories so I could read quickly in my lunch break but after skimming through the first 3 pages and then trying to read about a dying AIDS patient and finally settling on a story about a girl who was so fat that she was shocked when someone wanted to marry her and then he took off when she decided to lose weight (sorry to spoil that ending, but that is as good as it gets!)..I knew that I could not continue reading such boring drivel. What was the point of these stories? I have no idea, except maybe to cure insommnia.PLEASE do yourself a BIG favour and DO NOT get this book!"
1,Note the graphics card requirements,"Unless you understand the graphics card requirements, do not purchase this game. I bought it for my son, who loves the bionicles. After days of anticipation, I couldn't get the game running on any of the three computers in my home; and they are all fairly new computers (512 mb ram, etc.). This was a bad move on my part and there is very little support available on the Bionicles web site. If you have a ""gaming"" computer you may be able to get it to run... I couldn't."
1,Fragile -- Do Not Purchase!,"Everything said on this forum about the fragility of this camera and the terrible customer service is true. The camera worked great for a few months, then mysteriously stopped working. When I took it to an authorized repair facility they voided the warranty because of ""impact damage"" and claimed that the entire zoom mechanism would have to be replaced to the tune of $200. What a bunch of b.s.! The ""impact damage"" was a tiny scuff mark that did not result from a drop (since it was never dropped). We babied this camera and took extreme care to be careful with it and it just decided to quit on us. I suspect that taking this camera out of its case subjects it to ""impact"" -- it just feels delicate and is an accident waiting to happen. Don't waste your money."
3,Optio S4i Trial,"Hi, I just tried out the S4i and have to say I'm disappointed with it. I was really excited due to the size and small lag time. I did a comparison of the s4i and my existing Canon S400 and the Canon wins with no question. The image quality of my Canon is much brighter and sharper than any of the images on the S4i.Couple of other things I don't like about the S4i. The USB Cable isn't a standard size. Why? Also, you need to load the specific USB software to get XP to ""See the USB Storage Device"". It should show up as a camera. I didn't have this problem with the Canon s400. This is Pentax's way to get the consumer from returning it once they've tried it. All stores say that you can't return it once the software's open. When I opened my camera the software was already opened so I'm sure I'll have fun returning this.I would go the the S400 or better for brighter and sharper pictures without the fuss and software.Good Luck"
5,AWESOME,"I was blessed with this book by a sister in Christ. I count reading it, as such a privilege. It not only drew me closer to the Lord, but it confirmed so many of my thoughts and beliefs on various issues. This book should be read by every man and woman before they even consider dating. Definitely before marriage. It gives insight as to how to deal with love, desire, and commitment while serving the Lord. Elisabeth talks about ""waiting"", ""wanting""... and ""longing"". She's real. Elisabeth is intimate and very eloquent. The stories touch your heart and draw you into a deeper commitment with the Lord, in search of His Will for your Love Life. It was awesome. I've read it three times so far, and each time I'm challenged with a new perspective."
5,Good service and good condition of the book!,Another great book by Elizabeth Elliot! My daughter and I loved it and found it helpful. It is a companion book to Passion and Purity. Thank you for your great service and great quality of the book!
1,Don't waste your money - you won't even be able to change the batteries,Hopeless light - not very strong. Also the 2mm hex key that opens the casing isn't distributed when you buy the light. I am now looking to buy a new light after just less than a year :(
3,"Mediocre, horrible sound editing -- wait for the 2005 CD","I have almost every Erasure CD there is, including imports... I have been to all of their concerts in my city... and this CD is by far MEDIOCRE. The songs could be so much better, but the sound editing is so horrible that the you can hardly hear the music."
5,an amazing sequel,After reading the first book i decided to buy this sequel to see what it was like. As i read on i found that the book delved into the backgrounds of the two girls lives. It showed that friendships can work long distance and even making new friends dosen't mean you forget about those far away. Tara Starr and Elizabeth are too good emotionally constructed characters and the personalities of both soon came to light. A good book filled with serious yet comical moments.
5,One of the greatest romance stories from Japan,"I find it difficult to improve on the great review written previously, the ""Snow laden Masterpiece"", as they say most of what I would say here. If you love Asian movies, particularly Japanese, this one is one of the finest because of it's depiction of the heartache of the loss of a loved one. No Samurai sword battles, just scene after scene of the stages of the human heart in a search to connect.Gorgeously shot in Japan, with twists of plot accomplished with great skill, I recommend it highly. P.S. if you love movies with lots of snow, this is also one for you!"
3,This was a so-so book,I thought this book had some good parts although i was disapointed with some of the things in the story.I would probly recomend this book to some of my friends(not likly) because they are not interseted in this kind of stuff.
3,???,"I thought that book (Up a Road Slowly) was boring.It wasnt for me, but i thought she did a good job writing it. the charecters seemed real,like they were ure friends.The book is more for girls rather than boys...."
4,Important Archives,"This is an exact reproduction of every issue of the Movement magazine, a joint publication of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Students For a Democratic Society. Extremely important archival material for anyone interested in the New Left of the 1960s and 1970s.Poorly laid out and somewhat hard to read, it would be perfect for an e-reader format. That said, it's great that this newspaper has been preserved for future generations.Please, please, please, consider a PDF format release!"
2,Not accurate,Never gave accurate reading...you could take your tempature 3 times in a row and get 3 different readingsDon't waste your time
4,I really liked this product. It just so ...,I really liked this product. It just so happens my son was sick and we really put it to use! I'd recommend purchasing one.
5,Nice Table,This is a quality product. I was very impressed with the packaging also. I highly recommend buying this if you are searching for a very nice small outdoor table.
2,pretty at first,"this table was quite nice at first, but after only a few weeks the laminated potions of the table top are warped. I was very pleased at first but am now disapointed in the quality."
1,one hanger???,"the ONE time I don't read reviews. Figures. Four bucks for ONE hanger??? The hanger I got was nice, but the product name is super misleading."
5,good quality,i like the smell of on my clothes. perfect for hang-drying heavy jackets. i can spin it 360 degrees; the clips are good too.
3,Health bounce,"I found the health bounce to be a little outdated, it's ok for a beginner or someone bouncing back from an injury or illness, but it's not enough for me. I still prefer the urban rebounding dvds.Joanne from Maine"
4,Great beginning video,This is a good DVD if you are just beginning to rebound. Carol is easy to follow. There is a nice warm-up session and then it gets a little quicker to get your heart rate going. It is about 20 mins long. Great for when you need a workout but aren't really feeling up to it or a little short on time. I always feel better after using this DVD.
1,Not a fan of the new formula,"I have been using this product for years and have been recommending it to my friends and family. Not anymore. The new formula is pasty, dry and doesn't absorb well. If I wanted a product with sunscreen I would have been buying it. I am still searching for a replacement, tentatively settled on Philosophy."
2,not really working for me yet,"I've always been afraid to buy one of these wrinkle products because i was worried they lied about what they can do... well, i've been using this product for a few weeks now, just about every day, and i am not noticing ANY improvement on those fine lines. I love Avalon's Lavender Lotion, so i thought i'd try this product. Oh well."
5,Cheese head w/coolie and finger,"Good quality, fair price, FAST shipping. Cheese head was large enough to fit adult male. Items were birthday gifts, and arrived before date."
1,Magnet Sucks,Good luck holding more than one hundred dollars. why do I have to write more than this. bad product. bad
5,Great front pocket wallet!,It was just as I expected and I am 100% satisfied with quality and cost of product.
1,erased cards,will erase cards held in the middle pocket. It erased 2 of my gift cards that can't be used. I ended up cutting out the magnets
4,Great for browsing!,"I read this book straight through, cover to cover. However I don't recommend that people read this book that way. I think this compilation is better appreciated if you read a few poems and take some time to contemplate them.I did notice something interesting about the authors of these poems: It seemed to me that most of them realised that they are actually about to die and felt that they wasted their lives in their religious beliefs. These monks took a vow of poverty and had no possessions, ever. They begged every day to make it to the next. Then in the end, they got nothing out if it. They realised they're going to die just like everyone else. Kinda sad."
3,Bilingual Would Have Been Much Better,"OK, it was a nice book to pass the time, but I think it really should have been bilingual. They took the time to write the names in Kanji and romanized the poems, it would have been nice to see it in actual Japanese. I did appreciate the romanized though, at least you can see what they actually wrote instead of the authors intrepetations of what they wrote (which are pretty good overall). I have to say though, that if you were looking for deep insights into Buddhism or Japanese culture, you'll probably be disappointed. I just bought it at the train station to pass time and I enjoyed it overall, except the translations were a bit loose at times. Well, maybe if they actually explained their reasoning for the translations it would have been better."
4,Great game for Enthusiasts of Rugby,"If you are a Rugby fan or are looking for an exciting game, you have found it! The game is as realistic as the real thing. You can play one of several different tournaments, or just play a normal match. It has all the best teams, international and club level, and 67 stadiums to choose from. Though the graphics are terrible! OVERALL GOOD GAME!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Well made, but ball head is finicky.","All the components are made from heavy metal and fit together well.The ball head, however, is very finicky. At 0 and 45 degrees, the mount can be tightened and will retain its position pretty well. At any other angle, though, you really have to tighten the screw. I'm afraid the thumbscrew will break off or threads will be stripped.The reality is that just being able to secure a camera at the 0 or 45 degree position, that is vertically and sideways, should handle most needs quite nicely.Jerry"
2,issues with quality,"Found a issue with a head that does not lock out properly on one of the two I bought. After checking it out and re-assembling it (very simple in design), it still did not work. the hassles of mailing something small and with low value makes this not worth it."
3,So So,"I was looking for a mount for the baby monitor video camera and this seemed to fit the bill. It has a lot of mounting options, several extension tube lengths included, so it was easy to get the correct position for the monitor. It's made with some heavy duty metal, so it feels solid......except for the ballhead it comes with. It seems like it should work well, but it's the worst, most finicky ballhead I've ever used. Granted, it was cheap, but getting it to stay in one spot was troublesome. I should have gone with a GorillaPod or something and mounted the camera directly to the crib rail. Once you have the ballhead tightened up enough to keep everything in place, do NOT touch it, as any slight bump seems to knock the ballhead loose again."
2,"Good product, but it's unnecessary","This is a good product ... Solid metal construction. Relatively easy to install, but in the box, Foscam has provided a wall/ceiling installation kit."
1,Genuinely dissatisfied,"I had no problem with the delivery as I received this item on time but when I opened it up I was so disappointed. The watch doesn't look new at all. It has scratches on its face while on its back, there is a trace of adhesive that has been peeled off. Morever, this watch doesn't look the same as the picture or close enough to what it describes as a gold-tone since it is more like a faded light yellow. I'll be glad to return this asap."
2,BIC SHIMMERS BALL PEN,"I am sorry to say these really didn't make me happy. They aren't really ""shimmers"". They don't write all that well. Very unsmooth. The colors are okay, but I wouldn't rebuy."
3,Average,Presents an interesting history of Geronimo's lifeRecommend for those interested in the subject during a unsettling life of the Nartive Americans
1,Lighter than expected,Shipping was very prompt and I received the earrings within 3 days. The silver celtic knot design was exactly as shown. But I was disappointed that the stones in my earrings wasn't the same vibrant lavender shade in the picture. Unless you're really close to the earrings you almost can't tell they're purple. To get an idea of how light the amethyst are google rose de france amethyst (3rd pic). I wish someone had warned me in advance before buying.
4,Excellent Novel,"I stumbled upon this book at my local library and now I'm keen to read all of Maureen Lee's books. It's one of those novels that always has something happening, and even when it's late at night and you really should be in bed, you'll find yourself thinking ""Just one more chapter"" and before you know it, it's WAY past your bedtime. All the characters are interesting and it's refreshing to read such an action packed novel that's not too heavy on the romance but yet has plenty of drama."
4,dream,"i think this cd is ok.the only problem is their voices aren't so hot.their really really young.their puff daddy's girls and their white.first white group in badboy,that's something to remember.peace"
4,Pretty Good Teeny-Bopper Pop!,"I think ""Dream"" is an awesome group! It is amazing that a group of girls the same age as me, has such fabulous talent. There songs are like a mix of Britney Spears and Innosense. My favorite song is of course, ""He Loves You Not."" I listen to that about four times a day. Of course, they play it about a thousand times on the radio. ""Dream"" has a lot more good songs including ""I Don't Like Anyone"" and ""When I Get There."" There are fast fun songs, and slow steady songs. ""It Was All A Dream"" is a good buy for your money."
4,This is just sooooo great,"I got a copy of this cd and I think that it is just one of the best cd's ever made! These girls have just ggrreeaatt voices! I think that you should run not walk to the store to buy this cd. Believe me, go to the store now! I listen to this cd almost every time I'm on the cd player and I think that everyone, even the people who like the more rap music, should buy this selection!!!!"
4,I think it's more like 3 1/2,"I really listen to ""He Loves U Not"" ""This is Me"" and a few interludes the most. There are way too many ballads. ""In My Dreams"" is OK, but they keep trying to relate to themselves. ^_^ Anyway, I like the CD, it's just not THE best it can be."
3,pretty good,Every song ... except this is me (ok) and he loves u not. (GREAT!!!) this isn't worth your money - just buy the single 4 he loves u not.
4,2 Faced Cd,"I absolutely fell in love with Dream when He Loves U Not"" came out. I eagerly ran out an bought the cd. Tracks 1,2,3,4,5,7,8, and 17 are a few of my favorite songs in the entire world. Coincidentally, these songs were put at the beginning of the cd. Why? To make it look like the entire cd was great. I was fooled. After 8, the songs are stupid and retarded. I didn't even bother to listen to the rest. I've had the cd for lik 5 years, and there's still like 8 songs I""ve haven't heard. Listen to the first half of the cd, it'll be one of the best you have, drift off into the second part...you're doomed. Fave track- ""In My Dreams"""
5,Elise Nicole Cacciatore's Review!,"This CD is the best! I swear! Just buy it! Every single song is good except for the intro in the begining. The ""It Was All A Dream"" intro, it was stupid, but everything else is the best! Except my boyfriend, Joey Betro, is way, way betta!"
5,Not Just A Dream,I like this CD. There are a lot of good songs. I like This is Me even better than He Loves U Not. What We Gonna Do About Us' juicy beat just makes me move. Pain has a funny little rap that makes me smile every time.
1,Maybe you have to be a trucker...,"I am a space movie enthusiast. My friend Ian will pay dearly for recommending this one! Don't get me wrong, they have some original ideas... my favorite scene actually had me laughing out loud when the Charles Dance (the doctor from Alien 3) tries to get it on with Debi Mazar but has ""technical"" difficulties. Here an there they made some efforts to remind you that you were in space, but I wouldn't call it a space movie. Maybe I just think Dennis Hopper is annoying. Charles Dance should have been used more, he did well with what they gave him!"
1,ZERO STARS: I'll make this short and unsweet.,"This is Barb Wire-Battlefield Earth BAD! Why do I subject myself to such BAD filmmaking? Considering the talent involved this is pathetic. If you have a choice whether to see this movie or have a finger removed, I guess see the movie. Otherwise avoid this at any cost ..I must say one last thing, Stephen Dork is overrated."
3,THIS IS THE SHERMAN BROTHERS MOVIE SCORE ON CD,"This is currently the only CD with songs from the United Artists / Reader's Digest 1973 musical version of TOM SAWYER. It is not the soundtrack, which is not available on CD, even though it boasts one of the best nonDisney scores by the Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and marvelous arrangements by John Williams.This album is a low-budget studio version of the score with narration by Early Williams, very likely recorded in Nashville. It was originally released by Golden Records. It is pleasant to listen to, though nowhere near as lavish as the soundtrack."
5,"an uncanny swaying, shifting musical creature","Strange, intoxicating whirlpool of unnerving electronica welded to the gentle illusion of acoustica! Occasionally this uncanny swaying, shifting musical creature emerges into a January morning of crisp melodic writing with a fried breakfast of rhythmic toast and lush harmonic marmalade. Mostly, however, it slips away into the brightness of a moonlit winter night full of glistening and shimmering sounds and reflections.Inspiring stuff!!If that didn't make sense to you then go and listen yourself."
1,Sloppy research and mystery mongering,"This book is one of the many on the Bermuda Triangle that is more interested in acting puzzled over ""disappearances"" than actually doing any investigation or research. Many of the so-called ""mysterious"" disappearances are in fact only mysterious because the author couldn't be bothered to check the facts, presumably relying on second-, third-, or fourth-hand accounts. The gold standard for books on this topic is Larry Kusche's ""Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved."" That is an example of how a little careful scholarship clears up decades of mystery."
4,DOWN-TO-EARTH STRATEGIES,"""In down-to-earth language, Craig Smith guides you through alternative markets that are not dependent upon the whims of Wall Street. The book is full of techniques and strategies that will help you build wealth even as the economy falters."""
4,Jumbo baking cups,Product was a great price for the amount of cups I got. My only complaint is that they were a little smaller then my muffin tins but were still workable.
4,Darwin Undone,"This is an excellent book written by a brilliant author. It details the line of progenitors leading up to Darwin's theory as well as the historical milieu in which Darwin swam during his lifetime and some of the forces, social and otherwise, that influenced him prior to Origin of Species and beyond. Himmelfarb gives an insightful criticism of Darwin's theory working simply from the internal organization of Darwin's thoughts. Himmelfarb is so brilliant in her analysis that my only criticism of the book is that she didn't critcize the theory in a more detailed fashion.But it is a very readable and accessible book, and one that clearly points out some of the failings of Darwinian theory, many of which have been picked up by other critics over the years. However, I suspect that for the more sophisticated critic of Darwin, this book lacks sufficient scientific evidence--though it remains a fine history of the person, his theory, and its reception at the time of publication."
5,Meditations for Women - love this daily time to myself,"This is a wonderful book for any woman who needs a short time to reflect and meditate on her own strengths, weaknesses, goodness and how to survive day to day.Meditations for Women Who Do Too Much - Revised edition"
2,IN THE SPIRIT could use some spirit!,"I was disappointed with this dry, esoterical, hard-to-believe account, which seems like a push for Indian religions rather than a genuine supernatural experience. That one can discredit any psychic evidence when purported by a close, real-life contact such as Wendy Weir, sister to one of the Grateful Dead guitarists, was with Mr. Garcia doesn't even come into question when very little of Jerry's personality appears to have survived his death, according to the author's ""channeled"" dialogue with his ""spirit."" He sounds just too holy and out of reach to be true, and ""Dead Heads"" would be better off searching the VEDAS than here. Actually, the entire book including Weir's condescending approach and predictable upper-class conflicts suffers from flat affect. If this was meant for a pot boiler, it's a brave attempt."
1,shameless waste of paper,"This book is unbelievable nonsense. Jerry's spirit allegedly calls Wendy Weir, ""little one."" As the SNL Church Lady used to say, ""Well, isn't that special."" Jerry was a Beatnik not a Boddhisattva and he never talked like this in life, so why should he after death? Wendy Weir needs a pyschotherapist. Either that or she is consciously committing a big hoax for bucks, which would be utterly contemptable. What I would like to know is how this thing actually got published in the first place. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
5,Never a cold night,This is a great comforter. We have a california king log bed and it fit perfectly. I ordered it to go under a really pretty wool blanket and It is just right for cold winter nights. Lightweight and cozy. Highly recommend it!
5,Customer Service,haven't rec'd my item yet but customer service is great. I had accidentally ordered a King Size...all I did was contact seller and they changed size asap.
1,"Save your money, buy anything else.","Too bad I couldn't give this book 0 stars. Like others giving this book a review, I took the Networks class with Gouda (a few years back). There was nothing redeeming about this book, it's just total BS. I didn't learn anything of value from the book or the class, and neither did any of the dozens of other people I have talked to in person (undergraduate and graduate students). It seems that Gouda doesn't really know much about Networking. Thus, he created his convoluted interpretation that nobody else uses or really understands so he can elevate himself on a pseudo-intellectual pedestal. The other regular Networks teacher at UTCS is currently using a decent book 'Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet' by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross. Previously he used Comer's books on Networking. Either of those choices is vastly superior than Gouda's offering."
1,"Bad Writing, Worse Editing","There is no excuse for this book to have landed on the bookshelves in this sorry state. Mair's writing is pedestrian, but this might have been pounded into shape and been an adequate look at this brilliant performer. But Birch Lane apparently has fired all their editors and replaced them with Spell-Check. This book is so full of grammatical and spelling errors, factual errors, clunky phrasing, that it reads like a first draft. Didn't anyone READ it before sending it to the printer? It's shoddy, amateurish books like this that shatter my faith in the state of the publishing industry today."
4,Better Than Anticipated,"At first, i really didn't know whether or not their 2nd album would measure up to their first. But the truth is, they exceeded it, by following up with really good guitar based tracks like ""control"" and ""Science Fiction."" Other noteworthy tracks include ""follow me"" and ""white lights."" I highly recommend this cd to anyone whose into rock, punk, or emo/pop/punk rock combo. The lyrics, are also not just your typical pop punk lyircs.....go get it!!! RUFIO....RUFIO....RU..FI...OOOOOOO!!!!!"
5,Kick @$$,"Rufio's CD 1985 beats any other CD i have heard, it is by far my favorite CD ever, in my oppinion ""over it"" is the best song on it, its a great ending song, it gets you motivated to listen to the CD all over again. its an awesome CD, i would seriously consider buying it if you dont already have it."
3,"Good, stylish product, but could be better","I just bought this DVD/VCR player since it was onsale. I actually paid about the same price at Bestbuy. The first unit I bought I returned because the VCR made a little buzzing noise when playing a video. Then, I realized that my second unit made the same amount of noise. So, I had to put the DVD/VCR unit in my stand rather than on top of my tv. This reduced the amount of noise I hear from the VCR. Anyways, the DVD player is excellent and shows great pictures. If you use this product for recording at night in your bedroom, don't buy it. But if you use it to watch mostly DVDs and the occasional video, then it's not a bad deal for a decent product."
1,Move on and look for a better product,"This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. From day one DVD's froze and skipped. I thought it was poor quality rentals so I started buying my own DVD's. Brand new DVD's would not play all the way through on the first viewing. Spend the extra money and buy a better product, this is a waste of money."
1,Does not support high wattage Notebooks -> replace desktop,"After going throught the igo site I thought that I could buy the igo juice to power my notebook, a cell phone and a personal organizer. I was wrong.Firstly, although I used their configurator tool, it mistakenly told me that I could buy the juice and use it. E mailing technical support, I found out I need a lot more wattage than this product supplies. Nor would it power my other electronic products that should have been compatible.My laptop needs about 120W, the best they have tops out at 90W.Also some of the parts do not connect together.Be warned that their web site is a horror to navigate around, technical support on the site is extremely limited and the FAQ are a rehash of other pages. If you want a list of the products available you cannot get there without navigating through the configurator again."
5,Husbands favorite.,Husband loves it. One of his favorite movies. Another great indian story. So sad when they took all away his awards.
1,the Ghost and the Darkness,"bought it, but can't watch it as it's in the wrong Region - had to chuck it in the bin.the movie it'self is brilliant - Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer make a great combination in this great movie."
3,"At times, hard to watch for those who know the true story","While the jacket and intro says this is a ""true"" story, those who have read Patterson's account, or later retellings like Capstick's know there is a lot of fiction in this Hollywood version (surprise!). Tree-climbing lions with manes, a rouge American hunter who arrives to save the day, the stereotypical British cad who sends Patterson, Masai tribesmen, and numerous other digressions from the truth made this a bit uncomfortable for me. Kilmer isn't a very convincing Irish engineer, either. The scenery and cinematography are superb, however."
4,"Scary, scary scary!","Here's the deal.Watch this with the lights off, and let your mind go off to an Africa where animals were still the biggest threat to man. I felt like this was so much scarier than say Jaws that it got into my sleep. This film is scarier for being based on actual events. Of course today, there will be some people on the side of the Lions in the tale, but for my part, just kill them! There is only room for one at the top of the food chain.But that's just me.However, if you want to take something different away from this film, it makes a good allegory for running a business. If you create a culture of fear in the workplace (i.e. management becomes the lions to the workers) people will work in such a way as to not get eaten (written up or fired), rather than accomplish the desired goals of a company... But again, that's just me."
4,A great start to a hopefully great series,"Amazingly great fight choreography, excellent characters and geopolitical intrigue in the 18th Century, forty years before the French Revolution.Rose of Versailles + Fullmetal Alchemist + Zombies + cop show = greatWe watched it on On Demand as part of our digital cable package, but you could also rent it through NetFlix or Green Cine.We liked the first episode so much we had to buy the disk and watch more episodes of this really great show."
5,Iceage and Iceage The meltdown,"Once again, I have a thing for animation, and this movie collection has a place in my collection. These movies are great entertainment for children and fun loving adults. In all honesty, I liked the Meltdown a little more because there was a bit more fun and action and more hilarious animals. Buy it, I think if you like to laugh and have fun (regardless of your age) that these are movies you will enjoy!"
5,Great family fun!,The Ice Age movies are fantastic. The animators are perfectionists and spend a great deal of time getting it right in terms of characters; the movies are also hilarious for the entire family. I have each of the Ice Age and Scrat movies to date and can't wait until Ice Age 4 comes out in 2012. I've also bought the entire series to give as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren this year. I recommend this wonderful animated film.
5,Very cute movie,"My 4 yr old son loves this movie, very good adventure, story, he now has all the Ice Age movies."
2,Company is very different now...,"I couldn't find this magazine at bookstores any longer, so I subscribed via amazon. Nothing wrong with the subscription itself, but the magazine has undergone a drastic change. It's not a glossy mag anymore, very rough newsprint bound paper. Also the content is all strange ads and nothing but fashion. Company used to be a magazine for the modern woman, with articles, advice columns, etc, but it's now for a very young woman without substance. I was quite disappointed, and I usually LOVE all things British, and previously loved Company magazine."
2,"Writes great, aesthetics deteriorate quickly","I bought this pen in the champagne color back in 2004. The metal finish where you put the cap on the end while you're writing has rubbed off gradually, leaving it looking worn. It's no longer a vibrant champagne color, though it's still shiny with a dull color verging on a light-colored gunmetal. Also, the cushioned finger pad looks like it's wearing down inside. The pen writes beautifully, but Sensa needs to work on the casing so it maintains its lustre. It's been a few years now since I bought mine. Hopefully Sense has fixed this problem."
3,"Gritty, Undercover Criminal Partnership -","""Donnie Brasco"" is a movie based on a real life autobiography describing an FBI agent's undercover life in the Mafia and a criminal partnership that also develops int a deep friendship. Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI mole who poses as a jewel broker named Donnie Brasco. He is granted entrance into the violent mob family of Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Lefty becomes his mentor, showing deep trust in the man he knows as Donnie. When Joe's (known as Donnie Brasco) personal and professional lives collide, his mission is at risk. Joe sees gray areas between his ties to the underworld and the law. With divided loyalties, he risks his life, his marriage, his job and Lefty, the mentor that becomes his friend.Depp and Pacino, as well as the supporting cast of Anne Heche, Bruno Kirby, Michael Madsen and James Russo show extraordinary acting, and give compelling character studies to this gritty undercover criminal story."
4,All around good movie.,"Slightly depressing at times, but overall a good reenactment. I'm not sure how accurate it is compared to the true events, but I think it portrayed the interactions and emotions as they might be in that situation. Very well done."
3,Read The Book,"After reading the book, I was hyped to see the movie. I was let down by the movie, so many details left out. See the movie, then read the book."
4,Donnie rules! Three thumbs up.,"It's a good freakin' film, fuhgedaboudit! If you love Goodfellas, you'll really like Donnie Brasco."
2,Not historically accurate,"The Movie, Donnie Brasco, was not in my mind a very accurate movie. If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought the movie was made by Oliver Stone. I've read the book written in part by agent Pistone and then watched the movie, and it was like seeing and reading 2 completely different stories. The acting, however, was great, and the settings were very good."
4,"Great movie, but DVD light on the extras","This is a very good movie with great performances by Pacino, Depp and Madsen. The DVD has solid sound and picture, but doesn't have any extras. A ""Making Of"" the film or commentary track would have been nice and provided more info about the real life events in the movie. A must rental."
4,Thumbs Up For Vonage,"This section is reviewing Vonage, not this product, so I thought I'd chime in. Great is the word for it. Easy to set up. Good reception. Minimal problems. Goodbye SBC, FINALLY. I really recommend it."
1,He swings and misses,"In purchasing this novel I had hoped to be entertained as much as I was when I watched 'Field of Dreams' the adaptation of one of Kinsella's other novels. I enjoyed 'Field of Dreams' so much, and enjoy baseball even more. That story moved me enough to indeed visit the movie site, as Terrence Mann says for reasons they do not understand. But I found that though this book was about a game which lasted over 2100 innings it had little to do with baseball. It reminded me of something bordering on the works of Stephen King. I found that I had little sympathy for Gideon Clarke, or any of his fellow travelers. There is very little baseball action, the diamond only serves as a backdrop for this sorry character's flawed life. A novel it is, but not a baseball novel. Sorry."
3,Inconsistent spellings could easily defeat you,"I have long loved Michelin green Guides. Though they have grown heavier and less to the point, I still like the three star rating system for sites. However in this case it is hard to love a book where the spelling of site names in some places, like on the map with the stars, does not correspond to the spelling in the index or in other places. Finding things involves your figuring out the different ways in which Greek names can be spelt.Other books have found ways to cope consistently with changing tastes in Greek spelling. Michelin has not. Coping with these inconsistencies can be extremely frustrating.I now believe the best a traveler can do is to get this and the DK book on Greece. Both were done before the Greeks finished their preparations for the 2004 Olympics so beware of errors about practical things like airport access, a major new bridge, and consequences of a troublesome earthquake."
2,It's plastic!,Looking more closely at the 'lightweight' description should have clued me in.... but this is just plastic! 'black granite' was what I was expecting. Priced quite high for plastic!
5,Mosby's Dictionary,"This was a great purchase. Quick and easy and the product was in excellent shape. I'm in nursing school so this thing is an essential. We were told it was optional...but I've found I'm using it constantly. It is definitely a MUST HAVE for all nursing students. It's a great resource, very helpful."
4,Not exactly what I bargained for,"When I selected the book, ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bug"" I was under the impression it was a hardback. The delivery was very timely and the condition was as stated, but I was expecting a hardback rather than the softcover I received."
5,AMAZING! AUGH! PUDDING!,"This movie... is amazing! The theatrical movie has nothing on this! More action, better plot... I originally thought this was'nt gonna be so hot but once i saw it I was mesmerised! Who knew that doctor guy (Grandpa's companion) was evil? I just sorta felt he was a bad guy. This movie contains episodes 1 thru 6 of a 12 part microseries in Yu-Gi-Oh! It's sequel is coming out late this year, containing episodes 7 thru 12. I can't wait for that one! My favorite monster was Tristan's little dude! I call him Stubby Yellow Mutant Lizard Guy. He's awesome! He like zapped a bunch o' flower wolves 600 ways from Sunday! Go little dude go!"
4,Stories you'll never read anywhere else,"Slim, easy to read collection of stories and ""quotes"" from West Virginia history. Eye opening and fun. Gives a human face to a history we are mostly unaware of. Good to open at leasure and browse."
5,PERFECTING LIFE IN THE COMFORT ZONE . . .,"Do avocados count as ""comfort food"" for anyone who didn't experience them until adulthood? COMFORT they are, topping the list for Reviewer mcHAIKU - what could be more creamy-tasting, and have just the perfect hint of nuttiness? The avocado fits into more recipe categories than most people imagine - because they are happily stuck with a bowl of dip!My favorite recipes involve 'pairings' with meats & cheeses, etc.; those also having a delicate flavor, including salmon, turkey, Neuchatel cheese and spreadable ""Laughing Cow"" cheese wedges (see mcHAIKU's review on amazon.com). Avocados score well for potassium content & aren't too salty. They are easy on your 'interior comfort' and rarely fail to delight.They are packed to fit your needs & economically shipped. If circumstances require, any surplus can be mashed & lemon juice added, then frozen to be used at another time with great success. 'Cheers' for Amazon's Grocery convenience."
3,A good book for a new coach.,"This is a good book if you want the basics. It has everything in it: conditioning in preseason, defensive and offensive drills, and sports medicine. The drills are very basic but important. After using some of the defensive strategies in this book, other coaches have asked me for this book. This book is great for youth softball. However, when your players are more advanced they will need more than what this book has."
2,Boring! Worse than DW4 Empires.,"This game is pretty much the same as Dynasty Warriors 3 and 4 but without the lag. DW4 Empires dont have lag either and is a much better game than this Dynasty Warriors 5 IMO.In Dynasty Warriors 5 each character goes thru about 5 stages then you see the ending. The stages are boring, small, and all look the same. The strategy of capturing bases is pathetic, DW4 Empires's design is better. To make things worse all stages are available from Free Mode. After awhile I got tired of playing the same stages, geez all the characters share stages, a big let down. There are NO witches, soccresses, battering ram, catapult, fire breathing cart, etc.... I was expecting all this and more. The stage design is truly sad.Overall I don't recommend buying this game. Get DW4 Empires instead or Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks."
3,A Fun Game That Shows It's Age,"The Dynasty Warriors series has always been a fun game around the idea of a single soldier mowing down hundred (even thousands) of soldiers on the battlefield. The games offer great stress relief and are fairly simple in design, but that does keep them from being fun. While looked at as a series, little advancement was made in the early entries (this one included,) but from a stand alone perspective it is a decent game. I wouldn't spend too much on it now days, but there is fun to be had (even today) with the game and series. The game-play in this one feels a bit more sluggish and clunky than that of newer games, but for its time it was a normal thing to find game-play of this sort making it a result of advancement in programming and development over the years. Still a fun game to those who like to feel insanely powerful."
1,It doesn't do anything......,"I thought this car was supposed to move! It doesn't do anything but honk, which it only does once after I take out the batteries, replace them, and then put the little man into his seat. After that it just sits there. My LO doesn't even look at this toy, much less try to play with it. She learned after the first few tries that her efforts were futile, however I keep trying. What a joke! Don't bother."
1,Bad Chair,My Chair only lasted 4 months before the arm broke on it. It is a very poor quality chair. Now that it broke I can't get ahold of the manufacture for warranty claim. If I was you I would buy a differnt chair.
2,Undecided,"I also had this chair for four months and the arms broke, dumping me in the floor. The fabric developed seperations (not tears). I had Office Depot give me a full exchange. The previous chair that this replaced was very similiar in price and construction (it looked the same to me except it had simulated leather instead of cloth)and it lasted over 5 years. A word of warning, the warranty only covers a 40-hour weeek and 250 lb. limit. I'll see what happens in 4 months."
5,The most usable vegetarian cookbook I've seen.,"This is an extremely accessible and user-friendly vegetarian cookbook. Unlike many others in it category--including most of the standard volumes--this book's recipes do not require elaborate preparations. The recipes are direct, workable, and excellent. This wonderful book deserves much greater name recognition than it seems to enjoy because, once it's used, it will replace many of its better-known cousins."
3,The best Christmas present ever!,"My mom ordered this book for me over the holidays and I finally got it last week and read it almost non-stop for 3 days. What I love most about Taking the High Road is the author's outrageous sense of humor and hands-on guidance.I've been divorced for 3 years and my ex is the original jerk. He shows up late to pick my son up all the time. He pays child support late. He's made these past few years crazy for me. Taking the High Road has great ideas for regaining control of my life, so my jerky ex doesn't have his way, and I'm having fun trying them out. And so far, knock wood, they're working."
4,Great child support collection tips!,"I really LOVE the child support collection section of this book the best. Shami is like Mother Theresa when it comes to her get-along philosophy, but when it comes to getting the money, she's like the best bill collector ever. I also got many ideas about making money and saving money until the dough starts rolling in from my ex again. Thank you!"
3,One perspective,"I bought this book for a synagogue library thinking it would help some of the older members deal with children who have become more observant. This perspective isn't addressed, it is solely from the viewpoint of young people having to explain things to their less religious elders. It would be more helpful if it gave practical advice to those who are less religious. I will probably return it."
5,Good prybar,"I purchased two of these OTC pry bars almost twenty years ago. I gave one to a friend who works as a heavy equipment mechanic, and kept one for myself. They held up to many years of use and abuse. The curve on the bar end gives more leverage than the single angle of most pry bars, and also give you a choice between more leverage or more lift. Recently mine went missing, so I was happy to see them available online. This review is based upon my experience with the same model purchased many years ago, this pry bar seems to have comparable quality material and construction."
5,A Delightful Message For Children...And Grown Ups!,"This book is simply delightful, encouraging children to ""Do Great Things!"" A perfect gift for a new baby, or any child...It would also be a great gift for a graduate or anyone about to embark on a new adventure. The rhymes make it fun to read, and the words ""stick"" as a result. The artwork is very distinctive, with a great deal of texture in the illustrations. I especially like the pages at the end, where the child (or adult!) can list the ""Great Things"" they have done and will do in the future. It's a keepsake book that will be kept as a treasure."
1,It's Green,"I was in dire need of a ""cheese"" hat for Halloween and I thought that a cowboy hat would be perfect. It was GREEN felt! Not ""cheese."" Needless to say I was less than impressed with the product."
2,Wrong Item,I ordered this thinking it would be a foam hat but I and received a green hat made of felt material not what was described.
1,Wrong item,I bought this as a gift thinking the cheese hat would be awesome for a Greenbay fan. I got a green felt hat. Luckily I got refunded!
4,Randys at it again.....,"Have just finished this, and thought that while it was fresh in my memory I drop down a few thoughts. Point 1) To really enjoy this book, I would suggest that you read his 4/5 other novels, as the characters re occur in each of his other novels. This wiil give you a feel for them, and you can see the development between books.I think that you will enjoy this book, even if you are not a Bible believeing christian. The issues mentioned, and the arguments to support them, may give you reason to question your stance, or, at least appreciate the other side of the argument.I throughly enjoyed this book, as I have done with all Mr Singers novels thus far."
1,lol are you kidding?,"I got this book because it's free and I wanted a good laugh, and on that front it delivered. The author shows a complete lack of understanding of what religious freedom means, and blames the judge for ""stealing Christmas"". At least the notion that any single person can ""steal"" a holiday when they didn't do a national ban plus killing anyone who dares to celebrate is funny enough that I snickered through the whole thing, but this book is ridiculous.The author just needs to understand that a secular nation, such as the US, cannot endorse a religion, hence why it cannot endorse Christmas. However, it can also not ban individuals from celebrating. Everyone can celebrate on their private properties, during their private times. We just cannot use public resources and time to celebrate."
5,This book is essential.,"The inclusion of the Goju-ryu Sanchin kata (complete with instruction for proper breathing) makes this book a must-have. Sanchin kata has many variations in different schools, even within Goju-ryu. Seikichi Toguchi was a very highly respected Shihan (master). The explanations in his book are lucid and the photos extremely helpful."
3,A cd that could have been a lot better,"I must say I'm very disappointed about the tracks they selected for this cd. They don't have Austin's new theme on by Disturbed which is really sad. There are only a few good themes on here, but for the most part it's not worth it. I hope the WWF can do better next time like they did on Volume's 3 and 4. If you do like the mid-carders and there themes, then this is the cd for you. There's not much else to say other than the WWF needs to put better themes on their next cd."
2,Not worth it,"This Album really isn't that good. I'm a metal head and a semi wrestling fan so I only really bought this for MotorHead because they are such a great band, and their version of ""the Game"" is great. Plus I thought Slayer was suppose to be on here. Where is Stone Cold's Theme? The Pie with the Rock sucks, I know he's a popular wrestler but he can do wrong. The K quick thing sucked. Kane's was ok. Kurt Angle's was cool, and all the rest blow."
3,Satisfactory,"I thought the costume was too cute for words. My only disappointment was that it didn't come with anything underneath like the picture showed, so I had a hard time finding something that matched to go underneath."
1,"This kit is cool, but the price is not.","Please be aware that this kit does not include a cotton candy machine. You need to have one of your own.This kit includes replacement paper cones for use with your machine, and 4 small packets of floss (colored and flavored sugar for use in making cotton candy).I'm sure this is a fine set, but $20+ is the wrong price. Something close to $5 is the right price.If you've seen this kit and the small, toy machine amount of floss that it comes with, you will laugh out loud when you see that you can buy 52oz of floss for under $4.00 right here on Amazon by searching for this item:Great Western Pink Vanilla Sugar Floss 52OZ #16085Of course, that amount of floss with a toy machine will last you several decades. But that's a good thing, right?"
4,not as bad as some say!,"It is made of flimsy metal but its made that way so you can place a thin piece of plywood in it to fit your window. The small thin plywood piece $6 @ Home Depot a envelope of stainless screws $3. I expanded the vent to fit the window, cut the plywood, then screwed the metal to the plywood. Looks professional and works perfect. Doing it this way is the only way to go to secure your window...."
2,cheap,"It's flimsy and it leaves aluminum residue on your hands, but it does what it's supposed to do. I don't particularly like it but I don't feel the need to send it back or replace it with anything else.If you want to leave it in the window all the time, you may want to add an insulating layer to the metal."
1,"sucks, save your money","this video is very boring. i was very dissapointed, for i liked the first version better. all it is is a guy following expensive cars and travel across america. no real action. they went to some car shows (SEMA and Nopi) but no commentary, just crappy music. there isnt even racing."
3,Nice ideas although a bit pricey,This is a good book but I couldn't help thinking that with some time I could find all these ideas online. But if you want a Halloween idea book for your holiday collection this is a great book and Martha's ideas are timeless and fresh. I don't regret buying it.
4,Question everyting!,"At a time when I was feeling frustrated with the business of acting, a friend recommended this book. I hate acting schools because I never feel like I learn anything other than what that teacher happens to like or dislike. This book was a conduit for that frustration. Whether you agree with him or not, as an actor, you should read this book."
3,Is it true or false?,"I was first disappointed when I read this book (it is so high rated in amazon.de and amazon.com). I read Shurtleff, Johnstone, Strasberg and other stuff. There are a lot of phrases to provocate the reader - maybe this was the intention of the author. The reading of this book left a few questions in me and I think that's good. I've read the book three times and I did like it more and more. To learn more about the kind of acting, that David Mamet prefers, I would recommend the book ""A Practical Handbook for the Actor"". If you are not a professional actor and do not have some experiences in acting or the different techniques, than this book won't be very useful and interesting for you."
4,"good, overdone","True and False is an excellent piece of work that, unfortunately, repeats its handful of fine points far too many times. What should have functioned as a number of short essays ended up as a book that, though short, still sees itself as an overlong collection of these essay ideas. Still, its approach to acting is refreshingly concrete rather than abstract and emotional, and sees fit to give more credit to the screenwriter than most critics are willing to condescend to do in our current mindset regarding film and theater.The product shipped extremely quickly and in excellent condition."
5,A Gift for my Wife,I purchased this CD for my wife as a Christmas present. That was a big hit. She was doing some research on the singers in the Big bands era. I also started to listen to Bea and she has a lovely voice.The recordings on the CD are excellent. Bea has the voice of a sultry angel.
2,Disappointing,"This novel starts out somewhat like a thinly veiled Pamela Anderson autobiography. Entertaining, wild, raucous, sexy and hard to put down. However, without spoiling the ending for those wishing to read it, the ending was highly disappointing. It seemed very abrupt, rushed and above all completely ridiculous (and not the fun kind of ridiculous we've come to love from Pam's first novel, Star) Truly, the ending left me wondering why I had bothered wasting my time reading Starstruck at all."
3,Good read until the end,"I loved ""Star"". ""Star Struck"" was a great fun read till the end. The end just didn't fit with the book. Both the books kinda read like her life with a few changes. Both are easy nonthinking reads."
4,Great Beach Read!! Juicy,"I read the Pamela's first book, Star and so I was really interested in reading the second book, Star Struck. The book has great locations and the plot is very good, the ending really surprised me too!! Some of the things that occur are incredible and the book just makes you want to continue reading to see what happens next."
3,WORTH THE READ,"ONCE AGAIN STAR RETURNS, AND THE RAUNCHY SEX CONTINUES WITH A VENGENCE ON THE FIRST PAGES! A LITTLE SHOCKING, BUT QUITE THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL ""STAR"" NOVEL. AN INTERESTING READ THOUGH, GOOD DEPTH OF CHARACTER LIKE THE LAST INSTALLMENT. I TORE THROUGH THIS IN ONE DAY. THE BOOK CONTINUES ON PRETTY MUCH LIKE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WITH THE NAMES CHANGED, EXAGGERATRED A BIT I THINK. ODD ENDING THOUGH, DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT, THE ENDING SEEMS HURRIEDLY ADDED. ALL IN ALL THOUGH I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A LIGHT ENTERTAINING READ, HOWEVER NOT TO THE UNDER 18 CROWD OR THE PRUDISH! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF SHE COMES OUT WITH ANOTHER NOVEL!"
5,Works like a charm,This was a Christmas gift for a packers fan & he loved it. It looks the same in person & keeps your drink cold :) It's a little bulky.
2,Cheap plastic,"After just over a year, I managed to break the arm rest on this chair. I'm a big guy, but not HUGE, and the arm rest snapped at the point where the arm rest attaches to the back. For a chair that cost $99.00, I was expecting a little better."
1,A LOT OF FALSE STATEMENTS IN THIS BOOK,"I AM A TEENAGER FROM EUSTIS, FL AND I WAS A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN ALL THIS HAPPENED. I ALSO HAPPEN TO KNOW BOTH OF THE WENDORFS. I DO NOT APPRECIATE THE WAY MS. JONES DESCRIBES THE TOWN OF EUSTIS, ITS NOT JUST ALL MOSS, AND THE WAY THE BOOK TALKS ABOUT CERTAIN PEOPLE. TONY STOOTHOFF DID NOT RECIEVE A D.U.I. WHEN HE WRECKED JENI'S CAR AND AS FAR AS HIM BEING A LOSER, WE CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR HER SKIPPING SCHOOL TO COME SEE HIM. THE BOOK MAKES ME SICK AND I THINK IF MY PARENTS WERE MURDERED BY A BUNCH OF VAMPIRES I WOULDN'T TRY TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY WRITING BOOKS AND MAKING MOVIES."
2,Great Story -- HORRID Storytelling,"It doesn't take a speech pathologist to recognize a stutter; likewise, it doesn't take a novelist to recognize poor writing. I was sorely disappointed to discover the accounts of the events very chronologically confusing and disconnected as if all the facts and interviews were ""shuffled"" like a deck of cards. Ms. Jones jumps back and forth between different characters perspective in a highly redundant fashion. Imagine the flow of the movie GROUNDHOG DAY with Bill Murray, only on a morbid level. Only when the group was apprehended by the authorities did the storyline take on a more direct, focussed approach. I did enjoy the depth to which Ms. Jones was willing to take the reader into the minds of the characters so that they might fully understand the power of peer pressure and isolation."
5,Amazing!,"I would highly recomend this book to anyone interested in Teenage Vampires, or Vampires in general! Aphrodite did a amazing job describing the events that lead up to the murders. There are great quote in the book, and she brought the events back to life. Their are not to many books out about Rod and his clan, but this book definitally makes up for the it, this is a must read book! It deserves much more then a 5 star rating! Its the best book ive ever read!"
4,good information about our culture we dont want to confront,"I am affected by a story of ""modern day families"" in a modern day town thats part of a culture that ""EMBRACES"" values that permit this kind of adaptation of evil to exist. This book reveals the truth about society's dark side whose abberant behavior is not otherwise detected on our collective radar screen. Our society is not creating mechanisms to detect this phenomenon before it manifests itself.Its good that authors investigate the 'real and now' to give us more than just a sound bite into our reality."
1,Amateur...White board & felt pens...Expensive if the whole set is bought.,"Besides from the above, the 'lecturer', if that's what you'd call him, uses the term ""OK"" so much that it's just utterly irritating.Don't waste your money on these DVD sets - just subscribe to Educator.com or KhanAcademy.com. This DVD is more like something from a class in a prison or army lesson."
3,"Good book, with some fantasy in it.","I like this book, but it came a bit with to much fantasy for me. I like the person Glory, and I liked the group she travels later on with, so I liked the book anyway, but I have rather a book with more realistic stuff in it."
5,Safety for your pup!,My dog always likes to walk on our road and although we're the second to last house on it there are still a lot of cars that go to the house beside me... I feel better knowing that if she sneaks out of the yard at night there is something to help cars see her hopefully keeping her from ever getting hit!!! Thanks for a great product!
1,Don't Know What I Was Thinking!,"First off don't be fooled by the chick with the big gun on the cover! She is just a cover model and has nothing to do with either movie. There are no cool weapons like the one on the cover, either! With that said, This movie is so god awfully stupid! And it's not funny at all! And if you think it is or you even laugh on accident. (I'll let you decide what's the matter with you.)This movie is pathetic in every sence of the word. I was misslead by the cover. When I got it and god help me watched it. I wanted to throw the dvd aginst the wall. And then sit in a dark room and ponder what I could have possibly been thinking. Don't buy this dvd. Only gave this movie one star, because it wouldn't let me post my review without doing so. This is a fair warning!"
1,Big Disappoinment,"After reading the reviews and being a fan of Troma movies since 1985 I decided to take a chance on Low Budget Pictures Mulva Zobie Ass Kicker & I am very sorry I did. I paid only $9.85 for this dvd and I truly believe that they should give it away like it was an AOL CD. I also believe it would end up in the Garbage like an AOL CD. I really wanted to give Mulva Zombie ass kicker a chance and I appreciate it's tribute to Troma, Romero, & Savini but that doesn't justify the lame dialog and lack of any real splatter. Bottom Line the gore is sparse and ill timed,the dialog & humor is awful. Mulva talks like a wigger if you can even understand her due to her ""humorous"" speech impediment. All I can say is watching my little nephew who is in the 5th grade cut down his friends is more entertaining than Mulva & Filthy McNasty anyday. Don't waste your time with this DVD rent or buy Troma's Terror Firmer instead."
1,Doesn't deserve one/half star.,"Any good reviews for this garbage is most likely written by the same morons who made this dumb flick. Two minutes into the DVD you know you've been ripped off, five minutes into the show you'll be back online trying to get your money back! What a rip-off. I'm a huge fan of bad ""B"" flicks. This isn't even a movie, just some stupid zeros with too much money and not enough sense to make a bad ""F"" movie. You just want to take the entire production company on a fishing trip and let them join the world's largest fish collection. Hey, they'll never be missed! A good title - rip-off DVD!"
4,A cross between AIRPLANE! and Troma films!,"Combines all of the elements that made AIRPLANE! and many of Troma's films work. Silly sight gags, ridiculous characters and on-the-fly gore...far more entertaining than any of the gross-out comedies that Hollywood's been vomiting out lately!"
1,Red Hot Pocker to the Eye,"To quote the great Bart Simpson ""This both sucks and blows at the same time."" If you have a choice of this movie and a red hot pocker to the eye. Open your eye wide. It wont be as painfull as this movie."
3,NHL 2004,"Ive always enjoyed EA Sports NHL series. I wanted a newer NHL game for my lap top so I looked around, and bought this game. While the dynasty mode is fun, create your own team can be used during a season, updated rosters...this game falls flat on game play. It's hard to control a player, game play is fast but can get frustrating, and you cannot have 56-0 games like on older versions. I prefer 2001 compared to 2004, get that game instead."
2,not very substancial,"Very flimsy, paper dividers rip easily, not very rigid. Not easy to thumb through to find dividers and different coupons."
1,Save your money!,"Not only was I not aware of the added postage with my order, the product received was very poor quality and much smaller than represented in the ad. If you only have a few coupons that are very small, you may be able to squeeze them in. You may need to create your own dividers because the ones provided won't last. The email correspondance with the company asking for a refund was very disrespectful and poor customer service. While willing to accept a return, they refused to pay the postage. While I wait for a response to the claim filed with Amazon, I suggest you look for a different product. Dollar store may offer you something better and less expensive than this specific item!"
1,Almost useless,"Since this coupon organizer is barely, very barely, expandable and not very wide, I've found it to be essentially useless.It's shaped, internally, like a ""V"", with the narrow point at the bottom and the wider top of the ""V"", barely an inch wide, at the top. And the included ""index"" cards are actually a smidgen too wide to spread easily within the organizer. It's also not very wide so longer coupons won't fit.It might be useful if you collect only a very small handful of coupons - but if that's all you collect, I'm not sure why you'd need this organizer in the first place."
1,find a different one,"The outer holder is nice, but the dividers are paper thin, and fold/crease easily. I don't think those will last long. They seem really cheap. I would look for a laminated version next time."
2,This took a wrong turn somewhere,"This book started off good, but then got stuck in the mire somewhere in the middle. The plot really made no sense what-so-ever. The last hundred pages were extremely hard to get through. And the characters actions did seem to be true to form. The ending just had me shrugging my shoulders. I agree with another reviewer--pick it at the library if you're curious."
4,An underrated sequel that's not perfect but very enjoyable.,"Halloween 6 was considered as an offence to fans of the series and as an unworthy sequel. Well the film undeniably is a bit muddled and has an independent plot from all the other. But that doesn't prevent it from being very stylishly directed and very entertaining and enjoyable. So horror fans in general will enjoy it , but only forgiving fans of the series will like it."
3,Halloween 6 versus the Producer Cut,"Halloween - The Curse of Michael Myers (also known as Hallowen 666: The Origin of Michael Myers) is one of the most dissapointing movies in the serie (except H5). The storyline is really really weak, and the ending is incredible stupid. Halloween 6 is, unfortantly, also Donald Pleasence's last film before he went into the forever long sleep... As a Halloween fan, i'll truly miss his charachter. I doubt no one could have played the part as good as himself. Over to the movie again. As i said, this movie is a really downer. But, however, if you can get your hands on the famous Producer Cut of the movie, then grab the chance. It's a whole different movie, plus it's 5 times better than the released version of the film..."
3,one of the worst in the series,"I'm a huge Michael Myers fan and I watch almost every 'Halloween' movie every year on halloween (except part 3)and I have to say this is one of the worst in the series. Its the last one with Lumus (not something they could aviod), characters are boring and 2D, and they story doesn't add to the legacy. Just stick with the original two and maybe parts 4 and 5."
4,myers badadada im lovin it,"this movie is cool. its fun to see how he kills in this flic. its a great movie. U never no wher he is. not the best of the bunch, but definitly worth your money. and u finally get to see his house. damn its a good movie"
3,We can see a recovering from part 4 and 5.,"We can see on this movie, a very good recover from part 4 and 5. Michael comes back ! He's scary and cruel again ! There is many bloody deaths, and we see someone from part 1, Tommy Doyle. The only thing I miss so much, is Jamie Lee. But don't worry, Halloween H20 is coming..."
3,Not the Best,"Halloween the Curse of Michael Meyers, the sixth installlment of the series, is a turn in the wrong direction. When they start bringing in occultism and all into it, they are getting to far away from the scary aspect of the story. The part where Tommy Doyle is brought back was neat. Also, I loved the part that explores Laurie Strodes family members. Michael doesn't want anyone to live in his house. I did'nt like the D.J. part, they could have done without him completly. All in all, the movie was extremely scary but I wish they had gone into a different direction. Fourtunatley Halloween 7 did get the series back on track. There is a lot of places it can go now, with a lot of great story lines to come up with."
2,HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MEYERS,"""Pursued by the masked killer, Michael's niece escapes from mysterious catacombs with her new-born baby. Then he starts killing a family which has the misfortune merely to live in his former home.""Sadly deficient in any worthwhile characters, all people you see are either stabbing-bag, or stabbing-bags-to-be. The angry father, nice mother and exiled daughter is so terrible cliché is hurt to watch. There are some redeeming characters, but it is so obvious they're going through tired motions.The setting and mood was excellent. John Carpenter should be extremely proud of his little piano notes. They keep you attentive. The film feels as though it as an artificial gloss, and it is distracting. But it looks nice. The blood and deaths are real, except the electrocution. There is no original-feeling musicThe whole movie left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth. I felt used.RECOMMENDED: No - it may have the kills, but it has no substance."
3,"Typical of the series, but tries too hard","Sure, this movie was very bloody and had it's share of nudity, like it's predecessors, but the plot is even more stupid than anything I can ever imagine. Supposedly this takes place 6 years after 8 year old Jamie had her little run-in with Mr. Myers, which would make her 14? And having a baby?! Funny, the actress looked a good 19 or 20 to me, but, technicalities aside, the plot is still extremely stale. Instead of harassing anyone who is related to him, Michael decides to kill off people living in his old house (Why? Was the rent overdue?) and discovers his last blood relative is across the street. Trying to tie cults and ancient sacrifices to Michael Myers motive didn't really help the plot, and my word, why did everyone pass out so much? Halloween 6 is extremely confusing and yet ridiculous at the same time. But aside from it's mean-spirited nature, it was mildly entertaining."
3,An interesting continuation of a now tired plot,"The movie begins with the murder of Jamie (Laurie Strodes Niece) the one thing she had, was a baby. Myers is appparently being protected by modern day Druids, whom are also after the child/to control him. The movie really does drag the plot out, but if you gotta see 'em all don't miss this one!"
1,a waste,"I attempted to watch this film when it was released in theatres back in 1995...I bailed with only 20 minutes left of the film and got a refund. Over ten years later, I finally viewed the producers cut and compared the two...although the producers cut is a masterpiece compared to the theatrical release, the damage had already been done by the horrible Halloween 5. I can truly say I am only a fan of Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween H20, the true Halloween trilogy. Those are the only ones I own on DVD. Halloween 4 was actually good but I just can't view it the same way as when it was first released since 5 & 6 all but buried the series...sad to see Donald Pleasence go out this way."
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","Although Dimension butchered it from the original, it is not the worst in the series (that would be 3 and 5)."
3,Bring on Halloween 8,"Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers is not all that bad. A lot of people are too hard on how it was done. The whole Thorn idea was kinda cool but it could have been done a lot better. I agree that there are a lot of plot holes and mistakes (ex. the mask, jamie, etc) but it wasn't too bad. I don't agree with the amount of gore that is displayed throughout however, it is no worse than any of the Jason movies. If you're a true Halloween fan than you'll watch it. Even though some parts make you laugh or make you mad, deal with it. Besides, for all you critics out there, do you think you could make a better movie?Now for the next part. As most of you true fans should now, Halloween 8 is in the process of being developed. Shooting is schedule for Spring 2001 so they are probably just deciding on a script right now. Let's hope they stay away from the whole Thorn idea. It wasn't done right in 6 and I doubt it will be done right in 8. So here's hoping that it's back to basic Michael!"
1,Very disapointing,Worn out slasher movie produced by John Carpenter which in my opinion is an insult to the Halloween series as a whole. The storyline is terrible. Jamie's body is found and her relatives must protect her baby. This film was made in memory of the late Donald Pleasance who died in 1996. Couldn't they have honoured in some better way?
2,worst in series,this is the worst in the series. it kind of gets out astray from the other films(not including 3) but is ok over all
3,"The scariest ""Halloween"" of them all!",Michael Myers is BACK! And he's out for Laurie Strode's daughter! This is a horror movie that is about a killer who just won't die! You will be at the edge of your seat if you see this one! It's great to watch at sleepovers!
1,CRAP CRAP CRAP,"This film is really bad.The Thorn makes Micheal Myers not at all scary.Thank God they pretended in h20 and ressurection the halloweens 4, 5, 6 never happened. Unless your a big fan of the series like me you wont like halloween films after seeing this one."
3,The Curse of Michael Myers!,"I REALLY hate the Thorn curse idea. Just because it's a HALLOWEEN film, I tolerate it. Dr. Loomis is awesome but he doesn't really do much in this one. Jamie Lloyd had a baby and now, Michael wants it, so it's up to Tommy Doyle (of the original) Dr. Loomis, Kara Strode and Danny Strode to stop Michael and protect the baby! Michael's evil should NOT be explained. It should be a mystery, a mystery hidden behind a mask."
3,"The scariest HalloweeN, but sadly, not the best.","Quite a rather good film, very scary. But once again, the violence is extremely graphic. Get this: This time, it links Michael to the druids!"
3,One of the best Halloween movies ever made!,"Halloween was a timeless classic, Halloween 2 had plenty of violence but lacked an original plot. I'd just like to pretend that Halloween 3 didn't exist, Halloween 4 had its moments but watching it once is plenty, Halloween 5 was the second best in the series when it was first released, but Halloween 6 stripped it of its title. Halloween 6 has plenty of action, suspense and violence to keep the average fan of the series happy. Halloween 6 is a fantastic action packed thriller that is a must have by every horror fan."
3,Scary...but weird,"I really don't know if I liked this movie or not, you know? I just saw it for the first time(I just got done watching it five minutes ago) but I'm still thinking. It was scary-very scary-but...I don't know! It was DIFFERENT! I'll have to watch it again in order to fully grasp the plot and all, but you'll have to see it for you self. I enjoyed how they brought Tommy Doyle back, and how the Myers' house is back to normal, but I can't really say I enjoyed the plot about Michael Myers being part of a tribal cult or whatever.It was better than three, but inferior to the original"
2,i dont know about zeece one,it was kind of cwayzeet but nut cwazeet enough for zee wikes of me. if you see awan teaw him i saw it
5,Father-Daughter Relationships,"I never understood alot of things about my dad or why he acted the way he did, or even how it really affected me until I read this book! I was the most eye-openning book I've read in a very long time! I know understand why I chose the men I did in dating, and why they all were basically the same person until this book! I also realized why i had so many ""issues"" and that they rooted from my childhood with my dad! I recommend this book to EVERY daughter of EVERY age! It's an excellent book, it kept me in tears from the beginning to the end!"
3,Too hot!,"These braces are well made and do the job of restricting my wrists and preventing carpal tunnel ""dead arm"" while I sleep. But these particular braces are designed to increase heat in the wrist area which I guess is meant to help heal, but I don't think the heat is going to ""heal"" my carpel tunnel and I find that for sleeping I get uncomforatably hot in them. They don't breathe at all and when I wake up my wrists are sweaty. In the summer, wearing these braces all night is out of the question. I can deal with them in the winter and I like how tightly they wrap around my wrist and I feel they restrict my movement better than some other braces I've tried. They have the metal splint on both sides of your wrist, whereas a lot of other braces have it on just one side. But the heat thing is a problem for me. I know that's how they were designed, but I guess they weren't meant for overnight use."
2,Maybe it's just me..,"I will just explain why I rated it so low.1) Not sure if it's helping at all2) Sizing: I measured as it told me to but I think I still got a size too small. I would recommend, if your close at all to the upper limit, that you go up a size.3) velcro is so strong I sometimes can't get it off!4)there is a lump of stitching and material right on that section of fabric that goes between your thumb and first finger. It's lumpy and, maybe because mine are fitting me a bit small, it actually can leave a red area. (a pressure sore)I like the material and general idea of it... again, it may just be that mine aren't fitting right."
3,priceless Jack Benny,"The filmmakers rode roughshod over the play, adding dialogue and story elements and eliminating a whole character. The production values don't look that great either, with obvious studio settings. Jack Benny's British accent comes and goes - mostly goes - but he's terrific as the cross-dressing ""aunt"" and the comedy is fine. Fun to spot Richard Haydn, who played the agent in The Sound of Music, here as one of the Oxford undergrads. The DVD also includes a wonderful promotional short with Benny, Tyrone Power and Randolph Scott."
5,Speechlessssss,"I am from California and have always been a fan of the Australian idol show specially when it all started out with Guy Sebastian. I was fortunate enough to be in Australia at that time and watch it for myself first hand. He was truly awesome. Now I have to content myself with buying the 2004 Australian Idol DVD and after I saw who Anthony Callea is, I was truly blown away...he could be very well be one of the IL DIVO guys. His cd is so expensive here but it was worth it. Truly enjoyed his songs, even so the remixes on his singles. My advise if you want to know him first..watch the australian idol dvd. He will captivate you with his voice..guaranteed."
1,Great until it died,Had mine for about six months before it crashed and became useless. It was great until then. Will probably by a Western or Seagate now.
5,Pretty and Scary. Pretty Scary,"I'm afraid of this album, it is haunting that I like it so much. She really goes nuts on a few tracks and those are my favorites. The way she toys with a banjo mixed with some electronic experimental makes it really fascinating to listen to for any hardcore music fan interested in hearing something unique and out there.A good friend turned me on to this, and I didn't know what to expect, what I got is somewhat of a Residents feel, with a little bit of Aphex Twin and the singing stands on it's own as being both strange and alluring. You can't help but marvel at the lyrics this girl comes up with. She manages to have an interesting sense of humor and color the background with an array of pulse pounding and driving beats.So if you enjoy stamping your feet to the music and combine it with a good hearty laugh, I would check this out."
3,Kevin Blechdom - Bitches Without Britches,"It's nice to see that not everyone takes the IDM movement so seriously. Kevin Blechdom's Bitches Without Britches combines (perhaps for the first time) glitch and country-western guitar with some humorously over-the-top smutty lyrics. Blechdom goes right for the funny bone with tracks like ""Binaca"" and ""Interspecies Love."" Her remake of Tina Turner's ""Private Dancer"" makes you feel like you stepped into the only strip club that gives change for a dollar. And ""I Am Nastay"" is perfect for your local S&M club's main room. Once the novelty and shock wear off, however, there's not really much else to the album to recommend it. It's fun and would be great to put on at parties to get a laugh, but after that, it's pretty easily forgotten."
1,Don't Bother,"This product is useless. I purchased it because I have the new Ipod video player- which is a little more fragile then the previous.. well- I see this product which I thought would be great. but- It most certainly is not! Its awful. There were air pockets all over- and no matter how much I tried, my brother tried- or my friends- the air pockets would not go away. If you want air pockets all over your viewing screen then get this.. if not- I would suggest somthing different! This is horrible and a waste of money!!!"
5,Finally a great read with a surprize ending .,A great story line about what lengths corporate America will do to win in the end. It was a rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. The book is very discriptive and colorful. It leaves you with the feeling that Paul and Chicago are the guys next door. I have never laughed so hard in my life.
2,"Leaks, leaks and more leaks!","We purchased this table for my 18 month old daughter. She had a blast playing with the table, loved making the water wheel turn. The problemn was that the table leaked, and leaked and then leaked some more. I called customer service and was told to use vaseline until I received my replacement plugs. The vaseline trick worked for all of 15 minutes and then it was leaking again. Finally received the replacement plugs and they did not fix the leaking problem. I ended up having to return the water table. I hated doing having to return it since my daughter enjoyed playing it so much but the leaking was so excessive that it was just not worth it. We ended up getting a water table by Little Tikes and have had a much better experience with it."
4,"Good toy, crappy shipping","The toy is great, my 2 year old loves it. I just wish the water wheel thing attached to it rather than just sat on it so she couldnt lose it. I advise not to buy this from amazon, as it was just shipped in the regular box it comes in at the store. Ours arrived with a tear in the box, exposing the toy, and the toy itself is very noticeably banged up. Know when you bend plastic and it turns white in that spot? We have that all over the table. Didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it."
5,PERFECT for my 3 year old,"My 3 year old LOVES water. We got tired of kicking him out if the bathroom. He would go in there, play in the sink and soak EVERYTHING! After looking around here and reading ALL the reviews, we decided to get this one. We did NOT get it from here, though. We got it from the Step 2 web site. (No shipping cost) The order went through on a Monday and we got the table by FedEx on that same week on Friday. It took a less then 5 minutes to get it put together. We put it out side and he LOVES IT! The boats are a bit cheep looking, he doesn't care though. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!"
4,water,This table was ok i mean my son enjoys it somewhat and fun to play with when it is really hot.
1,bad plastic,"returned it in a day.. the plastic is horrible.. the boats wont even float.. the wheel tower does not stay upright.. i would rather pay 10dollars more,.."
1,Dangerous,"I got this for my 16 month old twin boys. All they do is try to climb on top of it. One of them actually got on top, and it tipped over, and he hit his head. If you buy this, make sure it is on a soft surface. I do not recommend it though."
5,Great for the summer!,My daughter loves splashing around in this! I of course added bubbles and more toys just to add to the fun. No problems with this - great buy to keep the kids entertained.
4,Best water table under $100,"I searched high and low for this water table after my daughter had played with it at her friend's home. It's great because it doesn't leak (there is no plug, you just turn it over when you are finished) - my 4 year old and my 18 month old play with it DAILY and in the 2 months we have had it they have not lost interest at all! I HIGHLY recommend this water table over every single water table available under $100."
3,A little disappointed,"I have a couple of criticisms of this toy. One, it doesn't have a cover, which means that it is basically always dirty. Two, the waterwheel is very tall -- my 95% 16-month old cannot reach the top of it to pour the water in. Also, the ""canals"" don't really work very well -- it's basically just a pool of water to play in. That said, a pool of water to play in is not a bad thing."
4,Great outdoor toy,"My 21 month old son loves this toy. It is a safe way for him to get his water fix, and he can spend hours playing without me constantly having to look over his shoulder. I would definitely recommend it."
5,Hours of fun,Bothbof my girls loved this you from age 14months until age 5! If we hadn't donated it to a friend when we moved they would probably still be playing with it.
4,A great summer toy for toddlers,"I bought this item because I have 2 kids, 3 and 18 mo. My 3 yr old was fine with a kiddie pool, but I was worried about my little one. I figured this table would be good for him to play with water without worrying about him falling in :) My 3 yr old ended up LOVING it as well. I have even used it in my unfinished basement when the weather got too cold for outside use. It's great because you don't have the sand making a mess out of the water portion like on some tables. No complaints on this product - very stable."
1,WON'T COME APART,"My daughter loves her water table, but there is ONE HUGE problem. The legs don't come off for 'easy storage'. You can get the legs back off after you put them on. That is silly to me. Anyway, Love the toy, HATE the design and the fact it wont come apart."
4,"So far, so good.","This was a Christmas gift for out 16-month old. Living in Michigan, it is hard to come up with water based play activities during the winter so we thought we would try this. It has allowed for some water play inside and my son seems to enjoy it. However, he has more fun in the bath. I am hoping that it will be more fun when we can use it outside and not have to worry so much about making a mess. As for durability, the table itself seems sturdy. i am a bit concerned that the small accessories may not last, but nothing has broken thus far. At this point, I would suggest this for anyone looking for a simple, affordable water play table."
4,Worth the money,"We like to add a bit of soap to the water and give our older child little people and other plastic toys a bath. I also found that the plugs leak, but a bit of Glad Press and Seal seems to do the trick! Also, Step 2 is sending a set of replacement plugs that are supposed to fit tighter. Even with the drips, this toy is well worth every penny!!! I purchased this water table for my 23 month old and she loves it! We already have a great sandbox outside, so we decided to look for a water-only table. We bring it inside to play with it on rainy days and take it out on our deck on good weather days. We've added lots of sea animals and bathtub squirters to play with, and measuring cups to pour water with."
1,They don't fit.,I have to adjust the guard so that it would fit my clippers. I double checked to make sure that these guards were made for my clippers. When I got the guard I had to adjust and trim the guards so that they would fit. I don't recommend these guards at all.
4,Good enough,"They could include bigger ones in the package, but they are ok.No negative comments about this product.They have very good quality."
3,"Adequate wire, but seems poorly made","The wire sounds great and was delivered in the correct length, but the stuff reeked of chemical solvents and was covered in some sort of sticky residue, both on the outside of the insulation and on the wire itself once I stripped it. I had to clean the contacts with alcohol before sticking them in my speakers for fear of gumming up the contacts. Not pleasant. Otherwise the wire seems great, the two wires are clearly differentiated, the insulation is tough and pliable, and the price is right. Note that as with most 18 gauge speaker wire you will need to either braid the wire into a loop or use some sort of plug connector to feed it into most speakers, as it is too fine to stay in place in most spring-clip connectors otherwise."
5,yes,my nail polish stays on a long time and it is reassuring that this company does not put harmful chemicals into their products.
1,not worth the money,This top coat is not worth the money. Go to your discount store and buy their top coat. You will have the same results. My polish chipped within 24 hours of applying the top coat. Armor? huh?
2,Pass on this one,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping for recipes that appear somewhat familiar. My family would be more traumatized if I tried to feed them hearts of palm and guava nectar then 2 dinners in a row of beanie weenies. The appendix charts repeats information freely found on many disaster survivor web sites. Bottom line, instead of buying this book, use the money to add to your food storage."
1,Who keeps tamarind paste?,"Interesting recipes and some good ideas for emergency preparation. Not realistic in terms of ingredients. If a tornado just blew through and there was no electricity, I'm sure I would not be using fresh citrus juices, fresh ginger, chardonnay vinegar and tamarind paste. I happen to be a great cook but I generally go get ingredients like that, not stock them."
2,More irritating than useful,"I have to give Drake credit here for a couple of good ideas: the formation of an actual canon of gay/gay-themed works and the suggested ways of building a reading group around those works. However, his approach borders on the erratic (some texts get huge write-ups, others barely get a page with little or no mention as to why they should be included in this survey) and his writing style aims for cleverness but usually only makes it to melodramatic, twee, or even flat-out vulgar. In my quest to find recommendations of ""gay lit,"" I have been better served by collections such as _Pages Passed from Hand to Hand_ and especially _The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature_, both of which provide not only spot-on analysis but also sizeable and helpful excerpts of the works themselves. (And not to quibble--after all, it's Drake's list, not mine--but was _Dancer from the Dance_ really as awful as he would like us to believe, and where is Leavitt's _The Lost Language of Cranes_?)"
2,Good basic set for hole cutting in metal,"Good price for a bi-metal hole saw set and good selection of sizes. Bought one as a gift for my brother to use for small jobs around his house. Nice case to keep everything together and the built in handle was a nice touch.Bi-metal are good for metal but terrible for most anything else. With bi-metal the high speed steel is the same and so it makes no sense to get anything other than the cheapest you can find. I have burned out expensive bi-metal hole saws after a single hole in MDF and after only 4 holes in Hardi siding so I have learned from experience to use bi-metal on metal and TCT tungsten carbide tooth hole cutters on everything else. The TCT cut much faster, work great with cordless drills, and last a lot longer."
4,SPRI Square Rocker Board,"Board is good size for most people. I assumed the rocker part had beveled edges like the one I had used in Physical Therapy, it did not. But it is challenging and great for balance. Instructional material is very clear. More instructional material on-line adds to the challenge."
3,Good for a Beginner,"Board did not exceed my expectations, or even meet . Yes it is a balance board but its not challenging. The piece on the bottom of the board is square and seems to make balancing easy... Or I have just gotten really good at this!"
4,Good text,Another good text from a top notch class I decided to keep for reference. The class did use supplemental materials but this is a good overall source for info on the historic origins and development of world religions.
2,Very Disappointed,"I really wanted to love this set-- the design is simple, yet elegant. We received the set as a wedding gift, but are pretty disappointed with them. Our main issue is that the end of the utensil is so heavy that it falls off the plate unless it has a piece of food attached to the end to balance the weight at the back. I can't understand why the manufacturer would weight the end so much heavier than the front. It's super annoying!"
2,cheap parts,"My first one I bought I had the problem of the pedal release lever becomes defective which made the vacuum not stand up. You have to constantly hold it while vacuuming steps and when not in use you have to prop it up against the wall on carpet otherwise it fall down flat. I thought maybe I just got a lemon and since it was so inexpensive I just went and bought another one. I figured to have it repaired would cost me more than what I paid for it since I couldn't find my receipt. Well, now the second one has done the same thing. I may try to just buy the part and see if my husband can put it on. All and all the vacuum has good suction even though sometimes the hose wants to fall off the hose clip but I won't ever buy another one!"
2,Clog......Clog....,"I bought this vacuum a 2nd time because its so inexpensive. But, you get what you pay for. In just a few short months, it acquired a bad clog. The problem is that the hose gets clogged to the point that nothing will ever make it up to the bag. I didn't have horribly bad carpets or tons of pet problems either. I had fairly new carpet and within a few uses, I had TWO of these vacuums clog up. If I could easily free the clog, I wouldn't have minded it. I know how to operate a screwdriver. However, you can't get to the most clogged up portions without destroying the hosing. I DO NOT recommend this item. If you're looking for more reviews on this item, check out the reviews under the remanufactured bissell powerforce. Spend a little extra, I will."
3,"One Shot, One Kill","I have just finished reading this book and have mixed reviews on it. On the positive side, the descriptions of the hunts and kills were very graphic and believable. The book profiles a variety of snipers and their stories. On the negative side, there is too much ""history"" of setting up sniper schools, etc. Also, what I found very disturbing was the many racist references to the enemy, especially the Asians. Terms like ""slant eyes,"" ""hamburgers,"" ""gooks,"" and ""yellow skinned..."" were unneccessary, even if they were direct quotes. I'm not sure how the authors could have handled this, but each time I read a dehumanizing racist comment, I was reminded why so many loyal Americans took to the streets in the 60's and 70's to protest the Vietnam War. It was called a racist war then, and I believe to this day, it was still a racist war. One Shot, One Kill is worthy of 3 stars at best."
5,BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was an absolutly fabulous read, it kept me interested throughout with its mix of historic information and actual sniper stories ranging from world war 1 through the setting up of sniper schools in the mid 80's. BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!! You'll love it."
4,One good book,"I liked this book a lot. A nice little tome on the history of sniping in most of the major wars of this past century. As a former member of a Marine STA Plt. (3/6), I thought the book was a good recount of the development of USMC and USA sniping programs. I particularly liked the accounts of the Korean war and Beiruit, which there aren't too many books about. There are soo many books on 'Nam and WWII sniping that it was nice to hear about some of the lesser known conflicts, a history that should be remembered before that knowledge is lost."
5,Fantastic Read. Highly Recommend.,"The book is broken out into several short narratives covering many theatres. Terrific reading, terrific book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the heroics of our veterans."
4,essential and true to those who have lived as a sniper,"I am a former marine and a current tactical officer for a large metropolitan police department. I have lived the hard life and fully believe that this is a book which hits point blank. I have been involved in many shooting situatiuons where I have had the crosshairs of a high powered scope on the head of the bad guy. This book relates all the emotion that is goining through a snipers mind. If you have not experienced the moment, you would not understand"
1,Information is Highly Suspect,"The author's association with another book entitled ""Taking Fire: the True Story of a Decorated Chopper Pilot"" makes the information in this book highly suspect. When I confronted this author with specific concerns about ""facts"" in his other book, his response was, ""You don't know what the hell you're talking about."" But indeed I do: I had the singular misfortune of flying with his co-author for an entire year and most of the stories they concocted simply did not happen. On the whole, the Viet Nam-related material contained in ""Taking Fire"" goes far beyond ""artistic license"" to the point of gross misrepresentation and self-aggrandizement at the expense of historical accuracy. I have no reason to believe that he did not do the same thing in this book. I fear that the author is purely into writing for the money and is re-creating history as he sees fit to make his books more marketable. For those of us who have experienced war up close and personal, his books are joke."
1,"Are we sure it's pronounced ""Aces?""","Aces: Iron Eagle III Oscar winner Louis Gossett Jr hits a new career low by returning for this entry, which is among the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen. The recipe for this cinematic disaster takes a director with some good credits on his resume (John Glen-director of five James Bond movies) and puts him in charge of an eclectic cast which includes Horst Bucholz (The Magnificent Seven), Paul Freeman (Raiders of the Lost Ark) Sonny Chiba (The Streetfighter), and Rachel McLish (who looks great but can't deliver a line to save her life); then mixes it well with ridiculous situations, awful dialogue, braindead action sequences and a big collection of obvious toy planes stuffed with TNT. The resulting mishmash is so awful I could almost recommend it for its total lack of quality. Almost."
4,Great product for what I paid!,"I got this tent for around $15 brand new, much cheaper than what I had seen anywhere else. I was prepared to pay around $25. What an awesome deal!Though it is rather large and the colors are not what I would have initially chosen, it does work with the tunnel we already had and my daughter seems to like it. I don't think I'll have any problem getting my $15 worth!"
1,Let's be a little less biased,"I am a native Californian and checked this guide out from the local library in attempts to plan a trip for some out-of-state visitors. This guide was horrible. It skipped over large regions of California that one might might be interested in. Living on the edge of the deserts, I couldn't help but notice that the guide didn't really pick up the area between the deserts and the coast. There is a lot more to California than the coastline, Palm Springs and the Mojave desert. This guide is useless unless you only plan to travel to the places it has. Furthermore, many of the entries are not objective, rather I found them quite insulting to people who may actually be associated with the areas they described. For example, an entry about a local university stated that the students only gain entry because their parents paid to get them in. This is not needed in a travel guide and I find it insulting. I recommend the Fodors guide to Southern California instead."
3,A witty way to enjoy (almost) ALL of Paul Newman.,"This treasured treat stuck in my memory because of its witty dialogue, e.g., ""And what was SHE wearing?"" ""Oh, sort of an off-the-shoulder smile."" Newman is a heavy-drinking author about to win the Nobel Prize. To everyone's chagrin, since writing his prize-winning literature, he has been supporting himself by writing pulp detective novels. When he suspects Edward G. Robinson isn't the same Edward G. Robinson he met the night before, he stumbles into international espionage in scenic Stockholm. His frantic dash into a nudist camp is one for the books! I only wish it had Closed Captions. I'm sure the Amazon.com listing shows that lack, but I forgot to check."
4,Wil the underdog rise to the top?,"Steve Azar enters the country music scene at a time when superstars like Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw are dominating the charts. But if ""Waitin' on Joe"" is any indication, country's elite are going to have to battle it out with Azar for billboard's coveted number one spot.Azar's ability as a songwriter is astounding, considering this is his debut album. ""I Don't Have to Be Me (Til Monday)"" and ""Underdog"" are perhaps the standouts among the 11 releases. But the message of ""Waitin on Joe"" is the most powerful.Well worth your money. 4 1/2 out of 5 :)"
2,Fellow score endulgers beware!!,"wha-hey you think, you're just beginning to come down from the rush of the action packed thrill ride that is the scorpion king - so being the soundtrack kinda guy you are you race down to the shop, after seeing the mighty JOHN DEBNEY'S name in the credits (of 'end of days' and 'cats and dogs' fame) BUT WAIT!! where is he? and what are all thses 'rocky' type american bands doing on an album which should let you relive the adventure as it's predeccesors Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvrestri did for they're films? Well sorry dude it is strictly for nickleback etc. etc. fans, there is no score....so at the risk of being attacked by half of america's youth for giving only two stars, it is not for those of you who were hoping to revive the old mummy score cd's So I gave it two stars 1 is for the two tracks that were written for the movie, (and it could've have lived without them) and the other star is for the cover (nice isn't it)...."
4,Great Soundtrack!,"Now the first thing i thought when the soundtrack came out was ""Should I buy a SOUNDTRACK?""Waqas is stupid!"
2,They had nu metal in Ancient Egypt?,"Well it sometimes seems that bands like Nickelback, Godsmack and Creed have been around for about 4000 years... churning out the same album again and again. The two stars are for Flaw and System of a Down, who are head and shoulders above the rest of this motley Crew of boring, dad-rock demagogues (Chad Kroeger, Scott Stapp) and ""personalities"" who can do nothing these days but lurk in the pages of tabloid newspapers (Ozzy Osbourne)."
3,typical soundtrack,"3 stars is just about right for this one. This is basicly going to be a hell of a short review, You have only basicly 5 to 6 good songs on here, that's pretty much it. And they are godsmacks I stand alone, system of a downs streamline,creed's to whome it may concern :note: this is NOT a new creed song by any means, it was recorded after my own prison was realsed and before human clay was realesed, never the less a truely great rock song. Nickelbacks yanking out my heart is pretty good. Altogh mushroomheads along the way does have a cool vibe to it and sevendust's corrected is awsome to. This review was basicly a brain fart so try to bare with me, but if your a huge soundtrack fan I'd buy this."
4,Elementary Statistics: A Brief Version,"The book came in perfect conditions and good time. Although it was not much of an advantage to purchase it from Amazon versus the campus bookstore. It did not included the feature ""Math Zone"" that new books are supossed to have and the price after the purchase of Math Zone separately ended up higher than of the same new item purchased at the campus bookstore."
4,Solid.,"I like this album, not as much as Liquid Swords but there are some really dope cuts on this record too."
3,cheesy production values but interesting history,This is a documentary that was definitely made on the cheap. But it still delivers some interesting history about some infamous haunted houses and the people who used to dwell in them...and who perhaps are still there in some fashion.
3,nice controller design but..,"After having another, close to the same controller I wanted to add another wireless controller as I got sick of the cords. While the shape, buttons and such are great and easy to use, this controller DOES NOT have a sleep function like my other controller does! Because of this, the batteries are ALWAYS dead, so I have to keep an extra set charged before I am able to use this controller. With my other controller, I can get several hours a day for several days use over several weeks with out needing to recharge the batteries. With this controller, I either have to take the batteries out after every use, or swap them out with freshly charged batteries before I can play. If I happen to forget to charge them before I want to play, I'm out of luck unless I want to play a single player game.After having both kinds of controllers, having one with a sleep mode seems like a must for any gamer, and sadly this one does not have that option, which is why I am only giving it 3 stars."
1,How to Solve Sudoku: A Step-by-Step Guide (52 Brilliant Ideas),"Very basic book, only for beginners. Better books available."
1,Waste of Money,"This book has no original ideas, only a hokey scheme for numbering the grid that is horrible followed by poor explanations on how to solve Sudoku puzzles.This might pass as a beginner's book, but it is too confusing to be even that.The best book for beginners and mid-level Sudoku solvers is still Carol Vorderman's Master Sudoku.This book is a waste of time and money!!!!AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Keith S. :{)>"
4,Tracklisting,"Royksopp - Remind Me/So Easy CD singleLabel: Wall Of SoundCatalog#: WALLD074XFormat: CD, Single, CD1Country: UKReleased: 05 Aug 20021. Remind Me (Someone Else's Radio Remix)2. So Easy3. Remind Me (James Zabiela's Ingeborg Mix"
2,This could never happen,"Although the first book was at least plausible (if one accepts the premise of the ""Event""), this one was absurd. How is it possible that the RON wins every battle it fights, losing not one commander? The weaponry Stirling uses (essentially Civil War-era) resulted in extremely large amounts of command-level casualties. While Commodore Alston is wounded a great many times, she somehow never dies or is even permanently wounded. Her perfection, as well as that of every general officer of the RON, gets annoying and totally ridiculous by the time the novel ends. In contrast, Walker's lack of perfection (and his realization of it) makes him the most interesting of the characters, and I find myself rooting for him, although an Islander victory is inevitable the way the books are going. Stirling might as well have killed Walker in Island and saved us the trouble of reading two more books."
3,The Middle Child,"This was entertaining, the research was extensive, the antagonists were exhausting and the protagonists were ethical to a fault (can ethics be a fault?). Like all second children this one had issues. There were lots of loose ends to be resolved in the next book, a ""filler"" feel to some of it as story lines were beefed up for the climax and that wonderful middle book introspection by the main characters as some of them got to take a breathe and consider their future. That said, there were some great battles, some exciting new plot lines and bunches and bunches of reasons to grab the next book and see what happens. My only suggestion... PROVIDE A MAP. Holy cow, we're all over the world here and I get confused easily."
3,Thank God for Americans...,"Other reviewers have commented on the political correctness and 'left-wing'ness of the author. How they could overlook the theme of the how wonderful American imperialism is and would be is beyond me. It seems inconceivable to the author that anything his heros might do could be wrong or evil. Likewise his villain is pure evil through and through with no redeeming features (and ironically the only character one cares about at all). And add to that the 'superhero' characters and it's almost enough to set the volume aside. Why the main characters are invulnerable to any sort of attack thrown at them is beyond me, and makes them completely unbelievable and unsympathetic, in my opinion. And finally, the author uses a plot device that is almost *identical* at the end of this book, and the end of the first one to end the climactic battle in favor of the 'good guys'. On the other hand, it is very well written if one can get past the heavy-handed politics of the author."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I bought this book only to find that mathStatica on the bundled CD does not work with the current 5.0 version of Mathematica. The website wants $89 to upgrade the version to a ""new"" version that will work with 5.0. This upgrade costs more than the price of the book! Seems like a classic bait & switch...."
3,Happiness Indeed....?,"While it is important to have a complete ""Candide"" as Bernstein intended it...it's hard to believe that this is how he intended it.This version sounds great on the stereo, but is utterly un-stageable. Most of the numbers, even the beloved overture, are conducted at a tempo that is much to slow. The operatic voices are sort of a blessing...but mostly a curse. Jerry Hadley is perfect in the title roll, but the rest of the singers are a mish-mash of thick European accents that mangle Wilbur's lyrics. Couldn't Bernstein find American, or even British, singers who could handle the lyrical requirements.The search for the ""perfect"" Candide, staged and recorded, continues....."
5,Superb performance and recording.,One of my favorite CD's. Fabulous irony. Wonder how this compares with other recording of Candide.
4,We love playing with this toy.,My 3 year old grand-daughter loves this toy. She combs Dora's hair over and over and likes to have the barrettes put in. I couldn't figure out why the mirror kept popping up (it fits in a slot behind the chair) and then I noticed there was a button on the bottom edge of the front that I was squeezing. The little drawers stay closed well so the barrettes are not so likely to get lost. I'm glad I got it for my grand-daughter. The only problem that I had with it is that the dolls have trouble sitting ing the chair--they keep sliding out. I finally hooked their hands on the combs that fit in slots on the side of the seat. That worked well.
4,Perfect for All-Day Wedding Coverage!,"This battery grip works great for all day photographing. I use it every time I photograph a wedding and have yet to change the batteries throughout the day. I've shot some weddings up to 13 hours and at the end of the day, I still found the batteries to have some charge left in them. The only negative thing about the grip, is the side auto focus button. It can be temperamental on occasion and I find it spends a little time hunting around for the focal points. When this happens, I just use the auto focus on my camera."
4,Great idea - very sturdy - lid not too great.,"This was perfect since it combines a picnic table and sandbox into one unit. My son can sit in the sandbox and keep his drink up on the table within reach, but out of the sand. As the sun moves throughout the day, we simply take out the umbrella and stick it in the ground where ever we need the shade. Before we filled it with sand this year, we used it as a pool too. The only problem I found was the lid does not fit too great. We've had a lot of rain this year and it flooded out the sandbox. We now keep a tarp over it to prevent having to replace the sand - which if you've ever had to dig out a flooded sandbox, is not fun."
2,A big disappointment,"The reviews and praise for this book have been misleading. After having read several books by Chaim Potok, Naomi Ragen, and Nathan Englander, I was very disappointed by Allegra Goodman's novel. Potok, Ragen, and Englander actually have lived in and know the Orthodox communities.On the other hand, I don't think Goodman really knows what she is describing. Not only does Goodman portray the Orthodox community inaccurately, but I did not feel any empathy for her characters. I suspect that the Orthodox community she is describing would not have eaten Barton's chocolates or Hebrew National meat. Nor would I have expected a woman to be left alone with a man in a room.Similarly to other reviewers here, I kept hoping that I would like the book and that something would happen in the narrative that would make me enthusiastically recommend it to others.Oh well, there will be other books..."
3,"A nice story, but not much happened","I think that Kaaterskill Falls could have been a phemomenal book. Each character was well developed and interesting, and there was potential for a fascinating story. I couldn't help but feel as though every storyline and subplot fell short - nothing really ended up happening. As I read the story, I was wishing that Chaim Potok, or a different author had gotten ahold of the characters and storyline - with more action this could have been a wonderful book."
1,Six characters in Search of a Plot,"This is probably the longest short story you'll ever read, but a novel it is not. There is no plot, no climax, no resolution, no dramatic tension. It has a few interesting characters, just not the ones who hang around long enough to move the story along. About 100 pages from the end I ran into a member of my book club who had finished the book and asked her if anything was going to be resolved by the end. I promise not to spoil the ending for anyone ...if only there were one to spoil. I can't for the life of me understand how this slight work could have been shortlisted for anything except reworking in a creative writing class for beginners.There is no dearth of excellent fiction about Jewish life. Why this one is being touted is a mystery to me. Francine Prose and Rebecca Goldstein are at the top of their form. Maybe Goodman will get there but she is not there yet."
4,A very nice collection of songs,"Many people will not know who Nicole is. But some people may remember her from the 1982 Eurovision Song Contest which she won by some margin. She is still very popular in her native Germany.Nicole does have a very good voice and this is a collection of some of her earlier work. It's a collection of ballads. It would appeal to people who like German music and are looking for something which is easy on the ear.""Ein bisschen Frieden"" (A little peace) is the classic little ballad from the 1982 Eurovision Song contest. ""Song for the world"" is in a similar mode - she sings this in German, English and French - a really beautiful song. Elsewhere on the album there are songs with a little German folk influence, a little country influence (""Traeumer"" - Dreamer) and a more dramatic style (""So viele Lieder sind in mir"" - So many songs are in me) - a nice variety.All in all, I really enjoyed this album."
4,Power probe master brake bleeder kit,"The only reason I rate this 4 stars is it does NOT come with an adapter / coupler too connect it to our brake bleeding machine. This is a very expensive adapter kit and it works fantastic! But, you have too call the company and order the adapter seperatly too connect to their ""specific style"" cuppler ends. It just seems for the money they would include this item they charged me an additional $20.00 for. And it tools 3 weeks to get. But as for the tool itself the adapters work great! Be use this kit at least 5x a week, and are much more likely to do brake flushes (read a great money maker and good for the customer as well) due to its easy/fast hook up."
4,Three Cheers for Pop Music,"It would be a mistake to overemphasize any comparison between the sound of Marc Carroll to that of The Beatles, The Byrds or The Beach Boys. This is unabashed 90's reminiscent power pop. But the unmistakable Rickenbacker guitars, the multiple part harmonies combined with pop, often folksy chord progressions do indeed ring a bell. If you're looking for tried and true pop virtues with a current sound, try Marc Carroll!"
5,Well Organized,"Excellent step-by-step breakdown. Also, really cool recipe for fake blood and theatrical wounds. Good overview of business concerns dealing with fimmaking."
2,Not an enjoyable movie,I found this movie in the horror section and the cover looked scary. NOPE. This couldn't scare a 4 year old boy. Don't waste any money on renting or buying it. 2 stars because it has a cool cover
5,VAULTZ are THE BOMB!,I just purchased my second one of these. They are great for keeping documents safe and secure. My husband and I like them. I recommend them for anyone who like to keep there important documents secure. You get to also set your own combination too which is cool. : )
2,one lock doesn't work,"I bought this for my daughter to take to college, and its appearance is great. But, she waited until it was time to pack to set the combinations to the locks, and only the left one works. After 10 minutes of jiggling with the lock, I was able to pop the right one open, but we can't use it because it's locked and the combination she set it to doesn't open it. Additionally, the return window has expired, so we're stuck with it. The lock mechanism is very cheap. One could easily pry the thing open with a pair of scissors, which defeats the purpose. Waste of money."
2,Morrissey NEEDS NEW SONGWRITERS,"Just because he is Morrissey does not mean that he gets to put out mediocre albums and everyone has to fawn all over them. I am tired of reading reviews that say ""It may not be as good as Viva Hate, but ..."" or ""At least it's better than what's on the radio right now."" Maybe if we hold him to higher standards he will take some action and find more talented people to write his songs. ""Ringleader"" is merely a good-enough album with the occasional catchy or interesting bit, but nothing that rises to the level of brilliance; nothing that anyone will remember in 5 years. ""You Have Killed Me"" and ""In the Future"" are both catchy (and sound like variations of the same song) but ultimately forgettable. ""I'll Never Be"" starts out promising but self-destructs. ""At Last"" is just painful. We all know Morrissey is capable of brilliance. Why not measure him against the standard of his own potential?"
2,A dud of an album with few good tracks,"I love Morrissey and he is my favorite musical artist. However, this is his weakest album ever (weaker than ""Maladjusted""). It is a let-down, pure and simple, especially since it follows ""You are the quarry"", an out-and-out masterpiece. The songs on ""Ringleader..."" are longwinded and boring. There are rumours that a new album is in the offing for 2008 owing to the fact that he's been performing ""All You Need Is Me"" on TV and concerts. I hope the new-album rumour is true because Morrissey needs redemption after this aural waste of time.Out of the 12 tracks, only three songs are decent: ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"", ""You Have Killed Me"", and ""I Just Want to See the Boy Happy"".All in all, if you are a diehard Morrissey fan and feel the need to collect every albums he's put out, then get this one. Otherwise, wait for the next one. This one's a dud!"
3,BRING BACK THE OLD BAND CIRCA 1988-1990,"Morrissey peaked as a solo artist after his ""Bona Drag"" compilation way back in 1990. Since then, it's been hit or miss, with a little less hit and a little more miss. Sure he's had a few good songs here and there, but he really hasn't put out a consistently good record since Viva Hate, his first. There only 3 songs on Ringleader I can stand listening to: ""You Have Killed Me"" ""In the Future when All's Well"" and ""To Me You are a work of Art"" (which is fantastic and the most Smiths-esque song on the album) Other than that, I find Ringleader a difficult listen."
5,A Must-Have for the Classic Country Lover,Wannabe Texan? This album is for you. Native Texans like me certainly appreciate the classic voices of Jennings and Nelson. Truly great country.
2,Did not last,"Great idea but not great product. Our under 1 year old puppy took all of the balls out in under a minute, them quickly tore each one apart. Granted, not much lasts with our puppy, but this one was done in minutes and was not challenging enough for her to have to work to get the balls out. If you have a not-too-smart dog that does not chew up its toys, this may be for you."
2,not durable,"Our Westie loved this toy. Unfortunately, within 45 minutes 3 of the 4 plush balls were ruined. By the next day, one corner of the box had been chewed away."
1,waste of money,I bought this toy for my cocker spaniel who is not destructive and has plush toys all over the house. In less than a day she had ripped one of the openings in the toy by shaking it trying to get the balls out (and ours only had 3 balls).Then her teeth easily punctured the balls exposing the squeaker. The store would not refund my money.I have owned dogs my entire life (over 50 years) and run a dog rescue so I know a good toy and this one does not stand up to what I would call normal use.
1,easily destroyed,"Though I thought is was a good idea, My dog ate part of the main part (the cube) apart within 10 minutes. The balls are still alive! But the cube part has been pulled apart and is now her tug o war toy. This is for a dog who does not destroy toy!"
3,good idea,"my dogs seemed to like the product. but they are much more interested in finding the squeaker inside. so the plush balls didnt last 24 hours before there was stuffing and squeakers all over the house! the plush box seems to be holding up pretty well. i still put their other toys in the box. and they still play with it that way. but unless there's a squeaker toy in the box they just kind of ignore it. overall the toy is cute and a nice addition to their ""toy box"". i just have to keep stocking up on squeaker toys to put in the plush box. btw i ordered the large and it was the perfect size for my min pin and yorkie. much too small for the rottweiler."
2,Easily destroyed,"After purchasing other Kyjen dog toys that were durable enough (relatively speaking, durable to me means lasting at least a couple weeks or more), I opted for this toy to feed my little dog's insatiable appetite.Unfortunately, the stuffed balls each lasted a couple days only. In fact, the plastic squeaker air tubes already began to protrude through the weak seams almost immediately, and the air chamber easily deformed permanently enough to prevent their operation.And this ""damage"" was done by a 1 year old, 6 pound Chihuahua (yes, their smaller teeth are sharper than larger dogs).The only positive thing to say about this toy is that it's much harder for my dog to pull the balls out of the puzzle box, so he spends a little more time playing with the box trying to get the balls out.Again, other Kyjen toys lasted much longer than this. I definitely would not be purchasing this toy again..."
1,Deceiving cube that is soft and smashes down easily.,"I had a German Shepherd pup who was 7 months old and EASILY got all of the balls out; whipping the cube around and having them all spill out. She enjoyed chewing more on the balls than throwing them about. I kept stuffing them back in and she would immediately take them out with her paws and mouth. This may be an okay toy for a smaller breed dog, but not large breed as they have a bigger mouth. A small breed may have a harder time to yank it out. My second Shepherd male pup did the same thing as my female so it was not just my one dog. All the squeakers are broken after gnawing on the ball the first time. Oh, and the openings rip easily. It is soft and mushes easily. Don't be fooled in thinking that its a ""sturdy"" cube because it is not at all. Was very disappointed after the first minute of playtime."
1,I agree with all of the above........,I saw this book on my way out of the book store last week. I remembered reading Audrey Rose and thoroughly enjoying the book so I bought it. It was a disappointment.
4,anozfan,"it never fails .... whenever i get a nostalgia trip i can never find what i want. but this is not the case with this CD. i sat back watching a DVD of ""Still Crazy"" and there i was thinking that it would be great to relive some of my teenage memories, the music in particular. So onto the amazon site I went and BAM a couple of weeks later I am cruising along listening to my new ""Big River"" CD. What can you say about Jimmy Nail... you either like him or not...i happen to love his hauntingly smooth voice and meaningful lyrics...Big River brings out the mans talent to its highest degree.....this CD isn't for everybody but those who love to sit on a winter's day with a glass of 10year old scotch by a window watching the rain come down will love it."
1,not impressed,"bought the router mainly for the parental controls, but despite having a background in computer and networking can't get them to work in any worthwhile way. the documentation is poor on this feature and others on the web seems to find them the same.two other complaints. there was a security issue that came out to which motorola issued a firmware update. a number of people on the web are complaining that the latest firmware that fixes the security issue is unstable. also related to the firmware update - the release notes proceedure for updating are not accurate. the firmware updates are .exe files which the router will not take. i imagine they are self-extracting executables, which is a pain for mac users.looking at the other reviews it seems that people are happy - but think twice if you are looking to use the parental controls at all, and find out whether they have issued a new firmware addressing the issues mentioned as well."
2,C A C O P H A N Y,"A well-known home-maker TV star, once played a ""klezmer"" tune on her program. She mentioned that this is what is known as ""cacophany"" -- a mixed-up and non-melodicmusical mess without grace or beauty. ""Cacophany"" was her ""word for the day"", that day, for her audience in the studio, and at home.Although the Alexandria Quartet plays this ""music"" as well as it ever can be played, it is still ""klezmer"" and still cacophanous. I give this album two stars, only because the title is honest enough to mention ""Delusions"" in it. For music with beauty, style, and magnificence -- look elsewhere, and not to ""klezmer"" music!"
2,A Hairy Mess,"My daughter likes (not loves) this doll. She gets very frustrated because this has to be the worst doll hair in history! It tangles so bad that you can't even comb or brush it. And that IS what little girls like to do when they play with their ""friends/ dolls"". The friendship between Adventure Dora and my daughter is fading fast. Dora is soon to be taking a one way trip to Trashville USA."
3,parents of a little artist.,Dora is great but its too heavy for kids to carry around and play with and its top heavy falls over unable to stay up right.
1,Would have been good if it didn't break.,"I bought this at a local music store as part of a guitar & amp combo pack. It was a great little amp, until it stopped working after only 5 months and maybe a total of a dozen hours of use. Now when we turn it on it just makes a loud humming noise. If it didn't break, I would say it was excellent, but it broke, so I can't even say it was ""fair"". Come to think of it, we had to return the first combo pack because a switch on the guitar went bad. Maybe Peavey needs better electronic components?"
1,Where's computer Science perspective,One of the worst books I've seen on digital signal processing. Can't figure out how this book got 5 stars. Check Discrete-Time Signal Processing by Alan V. Oppenheim or Digital Signal Processingby John G. Proakis
4,My FZ35 fits,"This review is only to say that my Panasonic DMC FZ35 (FZ38 in Europe) fits along with all the accessories that came with the camera. There's even room for an extra battery. You should read the other reviews for findings on the other aspects of this case, my concern when I ordered it was ""will it hold all the stuff?"" and none of the reviews covered this."
4,Fits a Nikon D5000 and the 18-55 lens,"I bought this bag as an on the go bag for my Nikon D5000--since simply hanging the camera around my neck all day made me WAY too nervous! The bag fits the camera and the 18-55 lens perfectly, and has room for me to carry an extra battery. I like that it has a hard bottom, so then you can sit the bag down without having to worry about the camera tipping (something you don't want happening with a DSLR!). It can be a bit awkward to get the strap in the bag as well, but I've found tucking the strap around the lens works well.If you're looking for a bag to carry your camera and all of your lenses and and gear, than this is not it. But if you want something to carry your camera and your primary lens while on a trip or out and about, I think this is a great option."
2,Better without it,"Bought the tension tester for 06 G35. I was able to depress the tool until head click, but it was just as easy to check the tension manually. By manually I mean use my finger and depress the belt and visually inspect how much slack is in the belt. The tool would max out whenever I heard the click. I didn't get any added confidence from using the tool. My opinion save your money."
5,Expandable trivet,"I gave this to my daughter in law for Christmas. Very sturdy even when fully expanded, looks great and she really like it!"
3,Should have included adapter,"This keyboard is fun and sounds pretty decent, however Christmas morning was a little disappointing because we had to run out and get more batteries, since we were one battery short. Also, the adapter power suppy was not included and is just about necessary since the keyboard zaps battery power in about 4 hours. Now I can't find the adapter any where. Big bummer."
2,Decent until keys broke,My daughter got this as a present a year or two ago. She lost interest but I used it a lot becuase it has some music built in and shows you what keys to hit to play it. So I used it to teach myself a bit of piano. That was great. The problem is the keys keep breaking. I took it apart and re-arranged the key-sets to move the broken ones out to the little-used ends but now I have broken my third key and I think it's kaput.
5,Each page is a poster worth a thousand words and tears,"I lost my ""Maggie"" this year. I was so sad but Bill Stanton captures the essence of this wonderful species and let me grieve and laugh at the same time. What a wonderful book. You don't have to love Bassett Hounds to read this. But if you lose your Bassett be sure to get this book. Bill Stanton needs to get posters on the market for us. Each photo is a gem."
2,"Great music, bad master","This is a double CD including Crumbacher's first and second albums, 'Incandescent' and 'Escape From The Fallen Planet'. If you just want a digital copy of Incandescent, find it on vinyl and rip it yourself, or get a remastered CDR. The sound quality of that album on this disc is terrible, and the first few beats of the first song are missing. 'Escape' sounds a little better; I suspect a digital master was already available for it. The print quality of the insert is also very bad. I wish someone else would re-issue these with better quality."
5,"Loved it,Bever laughed so hard while reading a book.","My aunt Hermina English,an avid Day Lily gardener(now deceased) loaned the book to me. Upon seeing how hilarious I found the book to be, she bought another copy and sent it to me. The humor,subtle and dead-on, is more than well-matched with the humorous illustrations. Anyone who has attempted a garden(and lost) can readily identify with the hapless gardener featured in this book. Rihard C. Undy"
1,Liberal lies and fearmongering,"Global warming is not caused by mankind. That is just a bunch of liberal lies and deception. God would not allow something like this to happen. If you are interested to know more about this and other lies read what my friend Shelley The Republican has to say about it.As for Al Gore, he is just a sore loser."
4,Inconvenient Truth,"This book displays the effects of global warming in a waythat is easy to understand. The pictures and statistical charts were effective as a resource in the book. It was very compeling because it made me realize the aftermath of such distruction. However, the message of global warming was completley repetative and annoying to read about. Especially the section of the polar ice caps melting. Beyond that, it was a very informative book."
5,Excellent,"Saw the movie, read the book and found both to be honest and informative. The book in particular goes a little more in depth on the issues and also outlines some of the ways in which to cut down on energy costs/CO2 emissions (which I found to be very helpful).There's a powerful simplicity within the book that highlights the problem of global warming without coming across as deceitful or agenda driven. With each passing year, or record breaking heat wave, I've become less of a skeptic and more of a believer. To each his own, but personally, I found An Inconvenient Truth to be a great read at a very nice price."
2,A Convenient Time for an Inconvenient Truth,"Cause Celebres are to superstars and politicians what water is to life. Publicity, good or bad keeps them in business. Mr. Gore is using fear of life extintion on Earth to promote his personal agenda in 2008. After seeing him on TV plugging the book and the movie, I began to wonder if his apocalyptic message is true or another hot air hoax like the Y2K scare six years ago. I just don't trust politicians.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir."
4,That darn truth,"I just finished reading through this. The book and info is very accessible to everyone. While you might not agree with all of the data the book itself presents some good arguments. It's a little self indulgent with lots of pictures of him and his family but it does convey the family side of Al.""Weather"" or not you agree with the global warming phenomenon it is important to at least look at the evidence and possablilities. Conservation is always prudent even if it hurts corporate intrests."
5,An Inconvenient Truth,"It was a very eye opening book. Very well written and very easy to read, many pictures."
2,Disappointed from the time I first flipped through the pages,"If you're looking for a well-written academic book on the subject of climate change, you should not purchase this book. It reads much more like a magazine than it does a book, and, while modestly enjoyable, I often find its frequently large typefaces and simplistic statements rather condescending. Although very scientific-looking and full of multimedia, the ""book"" contains few citations for Gore's numerous extraordinary claims. Mr. Gore has presented quite a picture book worthy of any serious 5th grade student."
5,Great Windshield,Just installed this windshield on my 1995 Harley XLH883. It not only does a great job but it also looks very nice. Easy installation with Memphis Shades mount.
4,Typical Peterson Field Guide,"It's a classic Peterson Field Guide. Lots of nice pictures, Good descriptions, Good maps. Requires a lot of page flipping to get the information you want. It's an old school format."
5,"Dick, Jane and crayons - What could be better?","As a pre-school teacher in my home for over 20 yrs., I am so happy to see the Dick and Jane books revived! They are the best tool for teaching upcoming young readers. I remember how much I looked forward to reading when I was first introduced to the family of Dick and Jane. If you didn't grow up with them, you don't know what you missed! The kids love the stories, and the pictures encourage them to use their imaginations. This is a nice switch: crayons and the stories kids love!!!!! One thing I would add: They make excellent birthday and Christmas gifts to any 4 or 5 year old!!!!"
5,STEW ROCKS,"The Stew Ensemble blends clever and sometimes funny lyrics with a beautifully arranged mix of soul, pop, rock and a little show tunes influence to make the mixture that is uniquely them. The samples you find here are not a good indication of what the disc is like, but trust me, unless your just a diehard metalhead, you'll love this CD."
5,Surprisingly balanced,"In the history of Rome, emperor Tiberius had a minister called Sejanus, who took on the tasks of running the empire while Tiberius spent his time in Capri, away from the political hubub which he despised. He called Sejanus, ""The partner of my labors,"" and trusted him implictly. Sejanus, however, was corrupt, committed countless crimes and enriched himself; Tiberius found out how he had been betrayed and removed Sejanus. To this day, unfortunately, all of Sejanus' crimes have been laid at the doorstep of Tiberius and his image has been tarnished throughout the centuries."
4,Pretty good oldie,"This movie just screams 80's, which for me is just fine. It's corny but still a pretty good movie if you like all the teen flicks of the 80's"
4,DVD,I wanted the movie Under The Boardwalk and got Tuff Turf at the same time - no reason to complain
4,High school on steroids,"This is an okay film and very much of its time. Mayhem and craziness abound. But it's entertaining and the climactic duel to the death is scary enough. It owes a lot to the ""Rebel Without A Cause"" themes of lonely boy trying to carve his niche in yet another new school, with well meaning but feckless parents. In this his dad is a decent guy and his mother is a troll. An almost grown up Kim Richards will surprise you. A far cry from her ""Nanny & the Professor"" days. What really makes the movie is the whacky side-kick played by a young Robert Downey Jr. With his customary twitchy insouciance, he pals along on this bumpy adolescent ride and is funny and sweet. Overall the film isn't satisfying, but seeing these two guys working together before ""Less Than Zero"" is a rare chance to watch the rise of two stars."
3,Gotta love the 80's,"Lmao!!! For some reason, I rememebered this movie from when I was a kid, and since I couldn't find it as a rental anywhere, I decided to buy it.It is really funny. You know... 80's funny. Like, cheesy. Totally. But it is amusing enough to enjoy, especially if you are a Robert Downey Jr. or James Spader fan. If you like cheesy, this movie is for you."
1,Wish I had that hour and a half of my life back.,"Wow, all the 5 star reviews really had me fooled. I love 80's teen flicks, but ugh, this is one unwatchable piece of ....It's a beyond-boring story, with a lame soundtrack and few absurd dance sequences thrown in. If you must see it, I beg you, don't pay more than the cost of a video rental on this."
3,Water-resistant remote hard to use.,Good tv for small spaces and high-end kitchen shop use. Water-resistant remote stinks and hard to use.
1,Never buy brother,Brother MFC printers big disappointment...mine broke just at the end of warranty period and i had bad experience with MFC 5100 C also!!!!
5,Kids Art Book,"I teach K - 5th art. Every year we have a ""What is Art"" introduction. This book will fit in perfectly with that lesson. I brought the book into class and it is getting great reviews from my kids. They laugh out loud when they are reading it. The illustrations are wonderful. They are so vivid they seem to bounce off the page. Outstanding!!!"
4,The Oregon Trail!,I read this book for a book report and my teacher loved it so much she read it to the class! It is a great book that tells about the life of a young boy on his dangerous and thrilling journey on the Oregon Trail! READ THIS BOOK!
4,Complete score for some great movie themes,"I bought this as a perusal book of the selections in this collection for my junior high band. The tunes and arrangements are not difficult - especially for second year players. One disappointment for me in this complete score book is that the piano part was not included. A piano accompaniment book is available separately. Included is a performance CD however. The format of this series is laid out in such a way that ""page 1"" is a solo of the tune and ""page 2"" is that instrument's orchestrated part in a full band arrangement. This conductor score uses the flute as the solo instrument followed by the complete orchestration. Selections are great for high school pep band too!"
1,The worst book ever written on the subject!,"The book is one more good example that Indtitutional Sociology (and Sociology in general) is going nowhere. Instead of looking at global processes, behavior during conflict resolution, pshychology of political actors, the authors once againg waste paper on micro and middle range analysis."
2,Hitmix.... Record Company Idea?,"This CD could have been a lot better given the range of material and how well they put it all together. The blocks are like medleys. The bad thing is that each block starts with the same chant ""Der Hitmix, Der hitmix...) and the same exact beat, this makes it all sound the same. The hitmix series might go for this particular sound as I have another and it is similar. There was much greater remix potential here than was used. This was just too homogenized."
5,For every coach at all levels!,"Hit Like a Big Leaguer gives great, in-depth instruction on both the physical and mental aspects of hitting. From the head to the feet and everything in between Jack walks you through the proper techniques of an effective Major League swing. Organized and easy to follow I highly recommend it for every coach at all levels."
2,Not a Great Book,"Hit Like a Big Leaguer by Jack Maloof is yet another book by a guy with a good pedigree who doesn't seem to understand what a good swing actually looks like. It's full of standard, and wrong, advice like swinging level to the ground and squishing the bug. He also labels as flaws things that good hitters actually do."
1,"Nice drill, but Makita has problems...IMPROVEMENT NEEDED!","I own both this drill and the earlier similar and slightly larger model, the 6213. I have three single speed Makita cordless drills and have owned them for 25 years. I will no longer buy another. The clutches failed on both the 6227 and the 6213 within weeks. The drill motors just keep spinning, and the chuck does not move. The three single speed drills continue to function flawlessly. Thank goodness I can use my 12 volt batteries in one of them and in my impact tool.I have just purchased replacement drills from the new Ridgid line at Home Depot. These have a three year warranty and a Lifetime Warranty, if purchased before December 31, 2003."
3,Not as bad as I thought,Originally thought that this product had failed (bent stem) but upon further inspection realized that the receiver this caster was screwed into had actually failed. Time will tell how this product will hold up.
5,"If you can't rock to this, check your pulse!","This is one Alice's best albums, and by far his most underrated. As far as great songs on the album - hey, where do you start? The title tracks starts it off great, and others top-notches include ""Snakebite"", ""Feed My Frankenstein"", ""Hurricane Years"", ""Little By Little"" and ""Dirty Dreams"". This is proof that Alice is a timeless classic who can rock with the best of any era, and the cameos by Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Slash and Nikki Sixx only add to this rock n' roll masterpiece!"
2,Tough Read,"This book was not meant for rabble or light weights. Mr. Thurow is a serious scholar with a serious piece of work, though his explinations are questionable. How, after all, is the fall of communism going to force a 4 day work week? Does the information superhighway really mean fewer blue collar jobs? Japan as the next great trading bloc? I don't think so. While scholarly in parts, it's hokey in other parts, and by the end, loses all continuity. It seems as though Mr. Thurow relies more on his reputation as a heavyweight scholar then he does reliable scholarship in this book. It wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Thurow was one of the few leading academicians still clinging to Marxism, because that's what this tract amounts to. Don't waste your time; go watch a re-run of CHIPS or something."
5,Silicone Pastry Mat,"Love, love this mat! It's the perfect size, cleans up beautifully and works perfectly! Makes rolling pastry 100% easier and will always have one of these! If you're thinking of buying it, just do it!"
2,Pathetic,"I loved Pollini's Chopin. So I was very glad when I found Pollini's Beethoven in the shop. Those late sonata are among my favorites and it seems it'll be magnificent.Alas... I couldn't find any musical note in these recording. Tempos are usually too fast for my taste and worse it doesn't contain any deep emotion lies in this great music.Kempf is still my best. For 32nd(which I love to the death) I like Michelangelli, Pogorellichi(?... spelling is quite hard to remember). Backhaus isn't my cup of coffee either.Anyway, Pollini is not. This is the worst recording of great late sonata of Beethoven I ever heard of."
4,JUST ANOTHER INTERESTING VERSION(s),"There is no such thing as the 'Greatest' Beethoven recording(s), just as there is no 'Definative' performance or 'The Greatest meal I ever had'.Pollini's Beethoven is very interesting. His Hammerklavier is clean, to the point, and I like it. But I don't think it's Great' nor do I prefer it to many others. To do so would mean that Beethoven's piano sonatas are not very profound and it's easy for one person to 'nail' them. They're not. What makes them 'Great' is that like Life itself, there are many ways of looking at them, feeling them, hearing them.BTW These recordings are over 30 years old. I heard Pollini a couple of months ago at Carnegie Hall play the Hammerklavier. Now, in his old age, he just bangs it out as quickly as possible."
3,Too Measured?,"Overall a superior recording. I have to agree that the tempo in a bit sluggish on the Pines of Rome, especially the fourth section, the Via Appia. The sound was almost too well blended. I'm used to hearing a bit more of the dissonance right before the final triumphal resolution. It doesn't last long but serves to punctuate the long build up in other recordings. That brief dissonance seems to be glossed over by Karajan, which makes the resolution less compelling."
2,Doesn't Fit,I used the guide to confirm that they would fit my son's 2002 Chrysler Sebring Limited but when they arrived they would not install. There is no fit or cut out for the seat belt.
1,bucket seat covers,"Very poor fit and lack of attaching points on seat portion to tighten it up. Also the head rest cover attaching sting broke during installation. I have bought the ""Saddleman"" brand of covers before and they are far superior to this brand. DON'T BUY THESE!"
2,"So so fit, nice fabric","I purchased the product to protect the leather seats in my Lincoln Continental. The color is much more brown than tan but the fabric is high quality and design is nice, however the fit is less than to be expected and there are no straps to help secure the covers to the seat portion so they continue to spring off the seat which is frustrating. Perhaps on cloth seats the covers might secure more firmly. I do not recommend for anything but cloth seats as they continue to slide off. The back portion also slides and requires adjusting. I would not purchase this product again."
1,TOTAL ****,"ok, maybe im being to harsh.... its a good beginners keyboard. but you know what? THERES NO AC POWER CHORD! means you have to run it on batteries, and after about a week, the keyboard will turn itself off if you play a chord at 2 volume! seriously, buy one that sais AC POWER CHORD INCLUDED!"
5,The Best,This recording is by far the best that has ever been recorded. Many other performers don't compare. This is a must have if you are a violinist or a well informed musician
3,'Twas a Good Story ... Except for ...,"If you like an overwhelming use of archaic English, then you'll love this book. I don't. I am nigh 'tis-ed, 'tisn't-ed, 'twould-ed, naught-ed, wrought-ed nigh unto distraction. 'Twould have been enough to have read all that only during conversational parts, but really? Through nigh every bit of narrative, as well? 'Twas waaaay overmuch! And truly, the author ought to learn not to overuse and oft incorrectly the words of ""wrought"" and ""naught"". I gave 3 stars because I liked the story itself, but if I had to base it on the above, 'twould have been merely 2 stars. I have read many other historical novels and naught one of 'em 'twas written quite like this. 'Twas overbearing and quite annoying. But as I said, the basic story was a'right."
3,Not as good as others,"This video was not done as well as the past ones they have out. There are a ton of better Wiggles videos then this. I also do not think there is really a strong focus on eating healthy as advertised. I would have to say after seeing them live and owning 8 other dvds this has to be the worst one so far. My 2 1/2 year enjoys it but it does not get him dancing and singing like the others. If this video is on for him to watch I can switch it out or turn it off with no complaints, not like the other wiggles DVD's he has. I would recommend skipping this one."
3,"good songs, bad production","Tift's voice is undeniable lovely, but the production of this cd hinders the beauty of these songs from really coming to life. the acoustic guitar is buried so deeply in the mix that it resembles a static-y strum in the background. and it's a shame, because tracks like ""I Know Him Too"", ""Virginia, No One Can Warn You"" and the achingly gorgeous title track are all excellent songs that could have been so much more appealing to the ear, given a better, richer production job. some of the songs on this cd fall too close to Sheryl Crow territory for me to personally enjoy, but the traditional blue-eyed country sound of most of these selections are nice."
5,Makita Belt Sander,"Sander arrived in perfect condition. The belt that comes with the sander should go straight into the garbage can! Once I put a good belt on, it was very simple to adjust the tracking, and it has held that adjustment with no issues so far. The dust bag is OK, but it can get in the way on some projects. The long cord is terrific, but be careful not to let it get in the way while you're sanding. Noise level is pretty decent. The sander performs very well, with no tendency to gouge the workpiece. All in all, I'm totally pleased so far."
4,Fast removal of wood ....,"Great Sander, powerful and removes wood fast; rather heavy but all belt sanders are heavy tools. The attached bag works well and has to be emptied often. If used on fast speed sometimes it tips and will gouge the wood irreparably so one must be careful to keep it flat at all times, no matter the speed. I used it on a huge teak swim platform and did a good job; With any other sander I would still be there sanding !! not a happy thought in freezing weather !!"
4,First belt sander lives up to its reputation,"I'm a hobby woodworker and just starting to add to my tool collection. This is my fist belt sander and I while I don't have experience with any other sander (other than a Dewault that a friend lent me to scribe a counter top in my laundry room - and it seemed to work well), I believe the Makita lives up to its stellar reputation. Everything just seems to work flawlessly. Once you have belt adjusted, it tracks perfectly. I understand this is the one issue that most users concern themselves with and I can't speak any more highly about it. Tracks straight and true for sure. I'm delighted with my purchase but only give it four stars because for $200 I think it should come with a bag or case. Other than that, this is a very high quality tool."
5,No Vivaldi in the Garage: A Requiem for Classical Music in North America,I loved this book because I knew Shelly very well in his early thirties. We were very good friends and I remember his tremendous passion for making classical music popular with the average person. I was very sad to hear he died. He was a very complex person.
5,"Great, concise book",This is a great little book. Very concisely covers Deming's work and how to apply it to an organization. It can be read in just a few hours. I highly recommend it as an introduction to his management philosophies.
5,Assume quality,I haven't heard his music for years forgot what a great singer he was and it works perfect as my MP3 download.
2,"Oh, the agony!!","I have heard so many people extoll the virtues of Boltons singing. Am I the only one who things that he sounds like he's in pain while singing? It sounds like his balls are caught in a vice grip. And as if that's not enough, track 3 ""Missing you now"", has Kenny G contributing his soprano sax to the melange. So now not only do you have Boltons agonizingly, excrutiatingly painful singing, but you have a screaming sax to accompany him. I would have only given it one star...but the extra star is for Patti LaBelle, the only good thing on this album."
1,"SHUT THE HELL UP, MR. BOLTON!!!!!!!!","I never liked Michael Bolton and I don't even like him now. I can't stand his whiny raspy voice. I was in middle school when this album came out, and cannot believe that teeny bopper radio stations in my area played this crap back then! When I heard/hear any of his songs, I want to turn it off. Don't waste your money on Michael Bolton! Go buy some Celine Dion. I hated his own remake of When A Man Loves A Woman and White Christmas on his later albums. His music still gives me a headache. It's painful to listen to. You think he can sing? Hell, no!!!"
3,Better Versions Exist,"The interpretations and performances of the suites from ""Swan Lake"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" are adequate, but the orchestra remains heavy throughout, and the technical aspects of the recording do nothing to enhance whatever subtleties may have existed in the studio setting. Beyond that, ""The Nutcracker"" has definitely been played much, much better. In the Overture alone, there is weird slurring in the strings when every note ought to be crisp and clean. The miniature nature of this suite needs extra care, and should be rendered much lighter. I would recommend Sir Charles Mackerras's performance with the LSO, either the excerpts or the complete ballet, then create your own suite by burning the eight tracks onto another CD, or putting them in order in a playlist on your mp3 player. For the other two suites, I have no recommendations yet, so this recording may suffice if you aren't picky."
2,Sappy Interpretation,"I just listened to ""nutcracker"" from this disc. There are liberties taken with the tempo--liberties Tschaikovsky did not indicate--that are far beyond the bounds of good taste. The famous bass clarinet part in the ""Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy"" is awful. It's actually worth listening to as a lesson in what not to do."
4,Quality could be better,"I'll preface that I came to this from a WinTV-PVR 250. The quality on that card is much better than on this one. I was a bit disappointed (even though I read the reviews that said as much). Basically, I had to, though, because I watch and record so many shows (and will soon be using it in a multi-person home), so a dual tuner has become necessary.Not saying the quality is unwatchable or anything like that. It's just not as good as the 150/250. Oh well. It's very much worth the money for what it does (dual tuners), but for me, it's just going to function as a stop gap until another company (or Hauppauge) comes out with a better dual tuner -- keeping in mind that I don't want to use Windows MCE since Beyond TV is more extensible IMHO (can you say Hydra TV server with a bunch of Beyond TV Links? see http://www.snapstream.com/Community/Articles/hydra/default.asp for what I mean)."
1,what generation are these for,I would not buy these until I know if they are compatible with 2nd and third generation Nano's....
5,Great Album!,"i've been wanted to buy this CD for quite a while and havefinally managed to get it just this week. it is a beautifulpiece of work, keren ann herself is pretty and so is her music.acutally at first i didn't really like the CD very much, butif you keep listening to it, it only gets better and better.a 5 stars french album, would recommend it to anyone who hasa mellow side."
5,Great book to pass the State exam!!!,"The questions in this book or simular to those used in the State Examination. They are phrased in the same manner, are equally as difficult and cover the same subject matter. You will be tested on the subjects of real property law, licensing law, contract and agency law, appraising, financing, math and other miscellaneous laws. This book is all you need to pass the state exam, I studied this book hard and passed the test no problem. A must for the prospective real estate salesperson or broker."
2,Unprofessional,"Speaking of ""Shock"", I find it shocking that this movie was in my library system. It has the quality of a home video, and the narrator sounds like he has no clue what he is talking about.In addition, he as an extremely annoying voice.He doesn't introduce his sources -- the people he interviews, therefore for all we know, they could be his neighbors who happen to share his interest but are clueless regarding real economics. They certainly sound clueless.Once again, I find it incredible that this DVD was produced, not to mention purchased by a library."
5,Great Shipper,I'm an avid reader and I'm always able to find what I'm looking for on Amazon. Their shippers are the best! Always fast shipping and accurate descriptions. Thank you.
1,Disappointed,"Was advertised as ""Tiffany Flora & Fauna"" a 2 book set. Only received 1 book, Fauna, with no explanation as to what happened to the second book. Very Disappointing!"
5,O.E replacement part.,"As normal with TRAXXAS Great products,Great support,Great etc. If your a TRAXXAS customer you'll know what I am talking about 5 STAR all around"
2,"Noisy, poorly made","I got this machine because I liked the styling and because of the other review, which stated it was quiet and serviceable. I don't know what machine that other guy was looking at, but the machine I got was noisy, with the fan making grinding and growling noises. There are no accessable screws or any way to open the machine to attempt to fix it. Also, it clearly says it draws 80w. The cooling is inefficient and heat exchange is limited to a metal plate in the back of the machine. Buy the other brand."
2,Way Overpriced,"I'm sorry, but I am disappointed with my purchase. I love the concept of a cordless vacuum with the extention, but even the 9.6v is too weak. It's not effective for much more than dust balls. Any debris with any weight to it will fall right back out when you turn it off. Definitely room for improvement."
2,"OK OK, well the kidds like it!","I got this as a promo for buying a few ""bazillion"" dollars worth of Makita tools. The wife thinks is a poor excuse for a gift, ouch! The kids think its fun to play with. I use it as my emergency extra 9.6 battery stash. Somebody told me it was a vacuum, call it a toy and give it to the kids. You'll get more for your money if you do that, then trying to vacuum with it."
3,A little too dry,"I appreciate that this is organic and I think they are the only sugar-free jerky out there which is why I bought it. The tasty is a little too salty and the consistency is WAY to dry, it is hard to chew."
3,Dry but tasty Turkey Jerky,"I'm updating my 2 star review to a 3 star review. Looking back, I've decided that they just make a drier style of Turkey Jerky than I prefer. Trader Joe's Turkey Jerky is the kind I like best and I know my more negative review of Shelton's product was based on my expectation from another product. The Shelton's Turkey Jerky is very tasty, I may not buy it again because of my preference for something more moist, but I would hardly turn any away. All 6 packages were consistently good."
1,Were the other reviewers reading the same book??,"I read the reviews. I read the summary. I thought, ""Hey, give it a try, it is supposedly reminiscent of David Weber and Steve White! I like those guys! Sure why not.""I'm sorry, but Fleet of Angels reads like a young-adult sci-fi book. Maybe I was browsing the wrong section of Amazon and accidentally wound up in the kiddy section. The writing reminds me of something David Weber might have produced if he were twelve years old. The characters are all one-dimensional and the plot reminds me way too much of the old Japanese animations of Robotech and Voltron (anyone remember those?), great if you are a kid, but painful to watch as an adult. Maybe in a few years this writer will actually reach some maturity in his writing, but if you are an adult and are looking for a well written, decently thought out, and entertaining book, then perhaps you need to look elsewhere."
4,Color bleeds!,"Overall, I was very pleased with this sarong. Like other reviewers have said, the beads are very fragile, and come off quite easily when trying to tie the sarong. I used it for the first time after going to the pool, and tied it around my wet swimsuit. When the fabric got wet, the color started to bleed immediately and left purple streaks down my legs, on the chair, and on my towels (which never came clean). I washed it twice before using it again, and it seems to have fixed the worst of the problem, but I won't wash it with any other items for fear of color transfer, which makes it a bit of a pain. Otherwise, very satisfied."
3,"OK, but you can do much better","This is certainly not a BAD recording, but I was about to write off Franck's Symphony altogether as this just didn't do much for me. Then I checked out Monteux's recording from my local library--and was hooked within the first 10 minutes! I highly recommend that recording (tough to find these days). Riccardo Muti's recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra also leaves this one in the dust (and is bargain-priced)."
2,schwuchtel music!,"schwuchtel musik means in german a ""hit industry"". This female singer never got a chance in the american international music market because she sings a german schlager......Do we love a schlager in the US?"
3,Improves with age?,"I am still hooked on the older games, since all I have is a gamepad. This game really needs a Steering wheel & Pedals..Graphics are naturally outdated, but it still gives you that ""edge of your seat"" feel around the track with forty two other cars. Lots of fun, but too precise for a gamepad. If you have a wheel & pedals, try this oldie."
2,disappointed,I LISTENED TO THE SAMPLE MUSIC AND THOUGHT IT SOUNDED GREAT.. WHEN I RECEIVED THE CD AND LISTENED I WAS AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF SOUND AND THE GENERIC VENUES... IT IS SUPPOSSED TO BE HEALING SOUNDS BUT TO MY DISMAY I THINK IT MIGHT JUST MAKE ME SICK.... SORRY... NO ORIGINALITY
5,Love at first listening,"I heard this recording on LP about a decade ago and I had a crash on this recording. Before I heard this recording, I did not have a very good impression on Gilels. Only other recording of him I heard till then was a brittle-sounding Beethoven's ""appasionata"" sonata, recorded in Russia back in the 1950s. In that, he sounded as if he was trying to ""outbang"" Horowitz, so when I found this recording, I was more interested in the pieces than their performer. But when I put the needle on the LP, I was absolutely shocked. ""My God"", I thought, ""is this the same Gilels???"" In these pieces, Gilels became a poet of piano, a gorgeous minituarist. Since then, I listened to this recording countless times, bought a CD transfer, and managed to even learn some of the pieces myself. This CD is really a jewel. Gilels is at his best. Never I heard him play with such an intimacy of feeling and conviction. This is an absolute ""must"" for anyone who loves romantic piano music."
4,Good product,"Not as comfortable as the woven boxers (which are the same price), but probably a better selection for the summer months. Overall, comfortable and a good product."
3,2 of the Same,"When I saw it, it looks like there are 3 different colored boxers, when I got it, it came with 2 of the same."
3,One sided coverage but saved by the Dominator,"This tape has pretty heavy coverage of the women's hockey competition and lengthy footage of the presentation ceremony (the US team won of course). It got a bit tedious ;P Fortunately, the men's competition saw Dominik Hasek in his prime, if you want to see sublime goaltending, this was it. The coverage was very US focussed and when the US men's team didn't make it into the playoffs, the coverage became pretty brief. There was a short comment about the background between Russian and Czech rivalry but not nearly enough coverage of the games. Then there's this irritating background music that ran through the tape. The shoot-outs and goaltending (Patrick Roy was awesome too) made it a worthwhile purchase."
3,A GOOD MANUAL WITH OLD COSTLY GISTS,"This ""Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology"" has an admirable practical approach. It depicted the characteristics of bacterial groups in a straightforward manner. Using a wide focus, it featured vivid illustrations, which will enable you to reason like a professional. The manual provided a good number of easy-to-master materials.However, I felt that this 9th Edition, which first appeared in 1994, is just too old. The authors should give us a more recent update. Also, the high retail price of this book ensured that many people would go for a better alternative. There are lots of them out there! The choice is yours."
5,Perfect for Old Photos,"I purchased this unit with the sole purpose of scanning about fifteen thousand old photographs. I was worried that the slick photos wouldn't feed properly but it worked flawlessly.I started with a couple thousand 4x6 photos from the 90s, and this machine kept sucking them in while I watched TV. Next, I scanned odd sizes of old snapshots, school, and holiday cards. Last, I loaned the machine to my 70 yr-old aunt and she scanned some seriously old family photos with no problems.The sizes of photos can be changed on the fly without changing any settings, because the software can see where to crop. The biggest photos I scanned were 8x10 and the smallest were little wallet school photos. By pressing a button on the side, the unit opens up and you can see the scanning light to blow off with canned air every once and a while.Overall, 5 stars for painless preservation of old photos."
5,Fine literary history in Southwestern Ontario,"Michael Ondaatje brings out the romantic past of southwesternOntario of the late nineteenth century in this novel. Followingseveral regular working-class people (some real and some fictional),he weaves a complex, but not complicated story appealing tolovers of fine modern literature. The reader is immediatelyentranced by Ondaatje's intoxicating style and is brought intothe novel, tagging along with every character in every scene."
3,A good look into life in Canada eighty years ago,"Patrick Lewis is a quiet young man who leaves his rural home in Canada to make a living in Toronto. It is the 1920's and life is not easy. He finds friends among immigrants who like him have a gruelling existence. They also have a political agenda into which Patrick is drawn. Clara is Patrick's first love but she leaves him to join her former lover, a millionaire who has chosen seclusion from the world. Alice, also an actress, is Clara's best friend and he meets her through his activist friends. Ondaatje's characters as always are drawn with great clarity. He describes the work they do constructing a bridge and a tunnel and tanning leather. We also meet two of the people Ondaatje uses in The English Patient, Hana and Carravaggio."
3,In the Skin of A Lion,"Stay with this book for the first 150 pages of mostly gritty stories about building the infra-structure of Toronto in the 1920's. Then, the poetic, magic realism, dreamy writing begins and it is beautiful and kind of crazy but fun to read. Enjoyable, thought provoking and interesting, that is all I can say."
2,Not to my taste at all,"This is supposed to be a classic, highly recommened to me by a literate friend. I agree that it is poetic, and has a gossamer feel to it. But, I found it a tedious read. It is in that somewhat detatched present tense that I do not relate well to. The story line is difficult to follow, the character hard to understand. I will not read any more of Ondaatje, I imagine."
2,boooooring,My Teen fell asleep 3 times trying to get through this book and still hasn't finished it. I tried reading it and found it was too slow paced for my liking. We are all avid readers so Im trying to be fair with this review. There are good methods in this book but the way the book is written unfortunately isn't very appealing to teens.
5,A comprehensive book.,"This book is comprehensive and well-written. It's one of the best books on the subject of the lost tribes of Israel.There is information on the camp arrangements of the tribes and the brigade emblems. These emblems are identical with the ""four living creatures"" found in the Bible.See Ezekiel 1:10 and Revelation 4:7.Mr.Bennett covers or includes the following:The mention of Israelite captives on Assyrian monuments.The witness of the Apocrypha and Josephus regarding the lost tribes.The Scottish Declaration of Independence(translated into English).An appendix detailing the view of Jewish scholarship.What is interesting with this particular index is that Jewish scholars have held that the lost tribes of Israel have not re-united with Jewry.The Index of Scripture Passages and Index of Persons,Places,and Subjects are convenient as a reference.I recommend this book for anyone that would like to study this subject."
3,Should have stuck with the original,"It was quite hard to believe. By the third book I've become quite annoyed with Peter and all the religion. It was well written, but I liked the first story a lot better. I don't recommend reading 2 and 3. They are slower and boring."
3,not too bad,"I loved the first and second books in the series but the last one was a real let down. Take my advice, read the first and second book but don't bother with the last one. It was disappointing how most of the characters from the first book weren't mentioned. However, I have to say there was a nice twist in the end."
3,not as great as i thought,"Ever since I found out the Remember Me was a trilogy i searched evrywhere for the books. I finally found the third one at a thrift store and bought it cuz i was so eager to find out what happened to Shari. When i read it I was immediatly caught up in evrything. But as soon as she started writing ""the starlight crystal"" i started to get bored cuz i HATE sci-fi books. so i forced myself to read the sci-fi parts.strike one against Christopher Pike. Then Peter and whol dicussion on religion and the yogi bored me too cuz I really didnt care about that, i just wanted Peter to walk again. strike two. Then the ending! I wanted to scream at Christopher Pike for having Shari die and become separated from Peter when the whole reason he came back to earth was to be with her. I wished the he had made Shari go see a neurologist, i mean she was rich and she had the money. so the third installment of Remember Me was okay not one of Christopher Pike's greatest."
3,Commercial Ships on the Great Lakes: A Photo Gallery,"Commercial Ships on the Great Lakes is an ambitious undertaking which is bound to frustrate the reader as the length of the book is not commeasurate with the breadth of the Great Lakes waterfront. There are just far too many bulkers, tugs, work boats of various types, law enforcement vessels, etc to cover adequately in a volume of this size. That said, the author has worked fairly hard to give one a representative view but a view that will surely leave out the one vessel you wanted included. In other words, the book whets the appetite but does not leave one satiated. In this day of relatively inexpensive color photography the book is dominated by black and white photos which are the specialty of the publisher. There is no reason this volume could not have been done in color. Commercial Ships on the Great Lakes is a worthwhile buy for the serious Great Lakes ship enthusiast but it will leave you longing for more - lots more, and in color too."
2,Inaccurate...,"I was really disappointed when I got this book. I am a huge Eminem fan, and really wanted to know a little more about his past. However, this book is not the way to go. First of all, the book said that Em was born in 1975, which is not correct. He was born in 72, so right off the bat I know more information about him then this author. So if this author can't even get his DOB right, then how do I know if anything in this book is accurate??? The rest of the information in the book was the basics, pretty much the stuff you already know from his songs and the media. Stick with Angry Blonde. No life information really, but at least you get to see what Em was thinking, in his own words, while writing his music."
4,It's pretty cool,"It's pretty cool but like the first guy said all this stuff I already knew but the pictures were off the hook but I can't wait till the book ""Maxium Eminem"" comes out cause I'm a true eminem fan and I always will be cause he keeps it real and I respect him alot for that"
5,Eminem is the best!,You should really get this book if u like Eminem! This is for fans only and once you start reading it you can't get your eyes off of it! I am the biggest Eminem fan! Buy it! ~Jess~
5,Cute for young ones,"This book is cute. It has a different texture on each page. I would recommend using it for read-alouds for awhile. Young children may eat or tear off the ""feely"" parts."
5,Great Book,"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She loves it. She will sit by herself turning the pages, feeling the different textures on the page. She always goes back to the fuzzy doggie on the cover and laughs. I would buy this book again and have given it to friends who have babies & dogs as gifts. They like it too."
5,Fiesta ware,A great product. I have many pieces.Amazon.com is a great place to shop. They have it all.
4,Fun romance with appealing characters.,"I don't read many romances. I really loved reading about Emily and Tay. The characters were a bit more developed than some of the other romances that I've read. And the sex scenes were incredibly hot. Ms. Dellin portrays Native Americans as true three dimensional people, unlike many other writers that I've come across. After reading this book, I had to go back and read the first in the series (though each stands alone well), which deals with Emily's sister Maggie and her husband's 'courtship'. I'm anxiously awaiting the third book in the series which features Maggie's sister-in-law, Cotannah (a very important charcter in this book)"
3,Knowing God,"Let me first say that I prefer the KJV for personal reasons. As for knowing God, as the first reviewer mentioned, this seems rather presumptuous on his part, that he could toss out that manner of accusation (stone?). I urge you to go to Scripture: Hebrews 10:25. As for works, I cannot see any reference in 1Cor 1:18 or 2Cor 2:15, wording has been altered to what seems to me to be synonyms (check them for yourselves), but nothing immediately about works. However the text in Romans remains consistant with this charge. The important thing is that the individual accept Jesus Christ as his or her Savior! As for KJV only advocates, what stands out as obsurd from my vantage point, is the many scholars and apologists that in fact use and accept translations other than KJV. I am absolutely sure that such noted apologists as, for example, R.C. Sproul, do not encourage a works centered theology! Unless he doesn't know God..."
1,Horrid little camera,"Bought this camera for my wife to use because I got a great deal. She didn't have it one week and it started having problems. Some deal.The first problem was that she couldn't download all the pictures without the camera shutting off. We found that in order to download the pictures from the 128MB SD memory card we had to download them 20 at a time.The second problem was the battery life. Even when using 2000mAh NiMH AA batteries we could only get about 50 shots before needing a fresh pair.Lastly the color representation was very bad. I have a picture of some flowers that I have shared here on Amazon. The blue flowers to the right of the yellow rose were really purple, not blue.I've had better luck with my older Olympus and my wife's new Canon camera. Avoid this camera like the plague."
4,An Interesting Amateur Documentary,"It was inspiring to see a documentary by an amateur sasquatch researcher. The details appeared credible and the story teller appeared sincere. In addition, the area of the research is in an area known for bigfoot activity, making this dvd worth watching. I would like to visit the area of the research one day myself."
2,Color too dark,"The Arcadia bedding set is beautiful with it's pastel tones. The valance is a perfect match, however, the rug is a much deeper blue and doesn't coordinate (except for the matching) animals with the pastel hues we took from the bedding to paint the walls. 3 people viewing our nursery agreed with me on the color not matching. It draws your eye to the floor. Otherwise, a cute rug."
3,POOR book,"if you get the japanese version (even the asian versions), you will want to throw this crap out, poor translation, the words are too big that cover the original pictures"
5,Best analytical stimulation for a child,"We play many adult and child board and online games and I am not aware of a game that is more mentally stimulating while being pretty fun for a child. My daughter has been playing this since she turned 4 and continues to ask for this series two years later. I am not sure that one needs to have all of the games from the series, since many of the puzzles are based on the same type of logic, but I feel that every child should own a copy of one. Since the puzzles offer four levels of difficulty, most of them would be challenging for the average adult. The great replay value will help boost a child's analytical skills to a point that many of their school tasks become trivial."
5,A great game for kids... and teens!,"When I was in 3rd or 4th grade some kids in my school got a chance to help make a computer game with a big computer game company. Turns out that they got to help name the Zoombinis in the Logical Journey of the Zoombinis. When they finished the game, everyone in the school got a copy.I loved it! From the day I got it until I had to give away my Macintosh computer when I moved to New York, I played it constantly. It is so much fun, even though it is all about math and is very educational.I am so excited for Logical Journey of the Zoombinis to actually come out as a computer game, so I can buy it and play it on my PC. Everyone who has a kid or is a kid or was once a kid should buy this game!"
2,Won't Run on any of my XP computers,"No matter how much tweaking I do, this program won't run on either XP machines. I'm hoping it will work on Win98."
5,Logical Journey of the Zoombinis,"Two or three years ago I got this for my now 11 year old daughter because she monopolized it at her friends' house. Their mother highly recommended it, and I concur. I am now looking to purchase two more for some cousins. They played it over Thanksgiving weekend and both 9 year old boys were hooked! I even became obsessed with for a bit when we first got it. The increasing levels of difficulty lend this game to a wide age range. And the Zoombinis are so cute!"
1,Doesn't work for me either!!! Windows XP,I should have listened to the others. This was very frustrating and a real waste of time.
3,"Nice Game, but just a little hard",I got this game with a multipack and it rocks!!! But just kind of a little hard but I like it.
1,XP owners - save your money,"Weeks later and we're still waiting to hear back from customer service. XP owners, listen to the consumer warnings...look elsewhere. I feel like I have been ripped off!"
4,Repetitive but Unique,"This game is an interesting way to teach critical thinking, but it gets very repetitive very quickly since it is pretty short, and once you finish one skill level, the next level is the same old thing with just a bit more difficulty each time. I got tired of doing the same puzzles over and over, it would have been nice if each skill level had a new set of puzzles.One good thing about this game is it works on both Windows machines and Macs, although the second Zoombini game, Mountain Rescue, does not work on Macs.All in all, a cute game, but likely to be tired of quickly."
1,What a disappointed product!,"I wish I have read these 1 star comments before I purchase this CD. I received 2001 version (have they ever updated?). It doesn't work on my 2004 (XP) computer. After installing, I click ""play"", it ruined my computer setting and disappeared. I tried to uninstall and install again, nothing changes. I have to return the CD. It is really disappointed experience."
4,Thanks to Pentagron review (2/15/2009) this works,"I had the same problems with loading this game that many others complain about. I have Windows XP. In the end my fix was I, (1)loaded the game, (2)right clicked on the game's icon, (3)clicked on Properties, (4)clicked on Compatibility tab, (4)under Compatibility Mode checked Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 98/Windows ME, clicked Ok. Now the game runs fine. I read that the game was designed for Windows 95. I tried running it under Windows 95, didn't work. Thanks again to Pentagrom review."
1,"Skip It, Bubba!!",Not worth the time or the effort.Dan Jenkins is usuallly great--not this time.Don't waste your time or the money...This one just doesn't cut it.
4,Death Camps,"This is a film that should be shown to teenagers. It is not done professionally, but by the soldiers who were there. Some of the names of the camps were not known to me, but were just as horrible as the well-known camps. This is a lesson that should never be forgotten."
4,Ro-He: a more modern Egyptian sound,"Ro-He is a very upbeat CD. If you are looking for good music for dancing, this is a great choice. This music would work well in a night club atmosphere."
1,Exercise in Frustration,"This may turn into a usable product, but it will be awhile before I know. My wife bought this at Amazon. Four layers of cardboard, 20 yards of plastic wrap, 40 minutes just to unpack it. Another 25 minutes trying to find the screws and other hardware in the mess of styrofoam, shrinkwrap, polyethelene sleeves and cardboard. (Never did find the hardware.) 15 minutes to vacuum up the mess. Mfg won't accept returns unless it's in the original packing. (impossible to do)I sent requests to the vendor for replacement hardware. We'll see on that. Directions are a single page of hand drawn sketches. On the plus side, everything is intact & pristine. If you buy this product, you better have half a dumpster for the packaging. Inexpensive, but plan on a couple hours to unpack & assemble. Definitely designed for those with a limited budget & ample spare time."
4,Pretty Kew,"Well, I got this bad boy for Christmas(for myself; such a giving spirit no?), and everything works fine. The sound quality is pretty awesome, and so are the earphones that come with it.The only reason I gave this a 4 was because the installation CD was missing; then again, I guess that's what I get for ordering a refurbished 108$ one. But even so, the Muvo^2 works fine when you plug it into the USB port.I also went to the creative labs website and downloaded some stuff to compensate for the lack of an install CD just to be safe. Real easy to use; just plug it in to a USB port, then go to removable disk on My computer then drag and drop your music or anything really while minding the 4 GB of space(technically, it's more like 3.7-3.8ish; get over it).Overall, that $108 I paid was MORE than worth it....especially compared what people pay for that ipod. And 4GB of space for music(or whatever else)is more than enough for me, for now at least."
4,great player,"I bought this for my partner as a Christmas present and he loves it. Besides the price, the main selling point was ease of use for loading songs. You can't beat drag & drop for loading your tracks. The display is small, but workable. There isn't a case, but after I received it I got a BodyGlove case with armband at Best Buy for $9.99 that is the perfect size."
4,Good but be aware,The quality of the spacer is perfict.but this spacer although it is writen that it fits the Subaru WRX STI 2008 but this car have diferent size which is 5x114.3.
5,Excellent Ball,"Worth all the money you pay for the official ball, it feels great, and will last a long time..."
1,ZZZZZZZ What A Bore,"Zoombinis Mountain Rescue was really,really boring. I have played the first on and it took me like 2-3 years to work on it. (only because 1) I didn't play it all the time and 2) I always wanted my dad to help me) ok now we are at a new type of adventure. I had to admit it was sort of enteraning at first then it got just plain boring. I was able to finish it in maybe and hour to an hour and a half and the worst part is you don't have to use all 635 (or something like that Zoombinis) you just need about 180. So I would not recomend this for somebody who want a chanllege, but if you want something fairly easy stick with this. If you want a chanllege take the oringal Zoonbini Adventure."
3,The Stereo headset,"The company delivered on their product promise, but I did not pay attention when I ordered it and they sent me the wrong one. After contacting the company they sent me a replacement and it also was the wrong one. After careful examination we found out that it was Me that was ordering the wrong part because they did not carry the headset for my phone, it was me that had my information incorrect. The company refunded my money and I sent the headsets back, I will do business with them again in the future. Thanks for everything guys. :-)"
5,Love K-Swiss,"I have purchased this shoe in the past so I knew how they would fit and feel. When I recently went to the store to buy a new pair, they didn't have my size. So, instead of wasting gas driving all around, I went home and looked for them online. There were several websites that had this shoe in my size but Amazon had the best value - price and shipping. Also, after I made the purchase, the item was received quickly. I will buy these shoes from Amazon in the future. It's much easier and more efficient!"
5,Awe inspiring,This is one of my favorite albums. I could listen to it over and over. I wish that LVB could hear Kempff play. I would be surprised if he didn't approve wholeheartedly with the interpretation.
2,Could have been alot better.,"I got ""Lone Rider"" because the book looked interesting and the reviews were pretty good. Well never buy a book based on its cover. I was very dissapointted! ""Lone Rider"" was bad. It seem from page one that there was something different about a Dallas and it didn't take long to find out. And Tess seemed like a character without a clue. If you are for a great romance writer check out Lori Foster"
3,Lone Rider should be left alone...,"Lone Rider by Lauren Bach is a cliche romantic novel. I purchased the book, because it was listed on so many Manias. When I saw the cheesy cover, I had an idea what lay ahead. Although, the story-line of the book is interesting, the follow-through is lacking. It isn't suspenseful, at all. When a book only mentions two people who could possibly be the bad guy in question and one of them is murdered, it isn't too hard to figure out who did it. Also, the book is filled with ridiculous, over-used descriptions of interesting body parts. If an author isn't able to write clever descriptions, call the parts by their real names; it may not be fresh, but at least it isn't comical.If you are looking for a romantic novel that doesn't require any thought or imagination, Lone Rider is for you."
2,A Plot as Holey As Swiss Cheese,"This author is talented; & writes great sexual tension. She just needs to stay the heck away from suspense plots. There are so many holes in this plot, some stuff didn't even make sense from a logical point of view. This author should in the future, stay away from writing about gangs, undercover agents, courtrooms, trials or the FBI. She obviously has no idea how these entities might actually function. Also: I have to mention that anyone who would drive along aimlessly on deserted Montana back roads, at night, trying to think up a new business proposal without enough gas in her tank and who doesn't even notice when her ""gas"" light turns on is not only a complete nitwit, but she is one SERIOUSLY distracted driver and is a danger to others. That is just one example of the main character's incredibly dumb behavior throughout this novel."
3,A slight retraction,"Sorry, I said that highly virtuosic playing is not period; actually, in some places (Iran, India) percussion has been very virtuosic for centuries. It is not clear, however, as to just when these aesthetics spilled over into Egypt and ""Middle East Proper."""
5,A Passion for Language,"At first I thought, ""Oh, no, not ANOTHER life of Charlotte Bronte."" But this one is worthwhile: convincing and upbeat. Rather than recording day-by-day events of Charlotte's life (usually viewed as pathetic), it emphasizes the miracle of her writing. I could not follow every step of Gordon's critical readings of the novels, but . . . Gordon offers so many other insights to feast upon regarding: the importance of Charlotte's letters, the Bronte family's place in society, the views of Mrs Gaskell, Charlotte's decision to marry Arthur, and the probable cause of her death. The comparison of Jane Eyre to Catherine Earnshaw and to Giselle of the ballet is only one example of Gordon's originality. The serious reader should also look up the reviews of the Times (London) and Independent (London)."
2,Is this needed?,"I'm not sure there is a need for ""A Leader's Guide..."" to the book ""Fighting Invisible Tigers."" Anyone who has a basic knowledge of children and psychology could grasp these concepts on their own. This books seems like a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of the original book."
1,Hocus-pocus,Don't get fooled by the cover! The complete absence of any real scientific foundation makes this so-called documentary a huge waste of time and money.Mere hocus-pocus.
4,Praise for Ken,"A decent series so far. Still a little in his Love Hina mode but he has greatly expanded the number of characters, almost to the point of not recognizing some of them. Still, a good read for those that like the ""harem"" type manga."
4,Fair to Midland,"In this performance, the LSO isn't as tight as it could be, and it suffers from some problems with intonation. The recording quality is only a little lumpy, but well balanced. The music itself is beautiful, and I myself have not tired of any of the movements in the F sharp symphony, and find the second (scherzo) perhaps my favorite. The Much Ado suite is as elegant as any of Korngold's earlier works--not at all simplistic or childish, but rather astoundingly sophisticated. The longest of the suite's pieces is just over 3 minutes, so they could only bore one of a particularly short attention span. I recommend this disc highly, but gave it a 4 star rating because of coordination and intonation problems. I would only give 5 stars to something that is flawless or just very musically played. I would characterize this performance as highly competent."
5,There's None Better,"I've been using study bibles for two decades and I've *never* found a better one. Finally, we have a fully theologically-sound, Grace-centered study bible, with notes and essays from the best scholars (Packer, Sproul, Boice, etc.). Everyone in my church either has one or is getting one."
4,wrong title here,"Despite the heading on the CD (by AMAZON) this a collection of studio cuts, and it is not live. If you want Freberg LIVE! go buy the Radio Show THE STAN FREBERG SHOW. This collection is an import collection of the British EMI Comedy series.Having said that, it ain't a bad collection of Frebergian nuggets, though STAN FREBERG MASTER SATIRIST is much better with the selections."
1,Broke,The watch is quite beautiful. Would have been better if it worked. The second hand kept sticking on the 34th second.
2,unsatisfying pretender to the Wing Commander series,"I found that the book was describing a universe which does not gel with the Wing Commander novels written previously by other authors. The characterisations of the basic characters abraided my own feelings gleaned from a distillation of the previous books. The basic plot premise, inherited from the film, may have been a handicap to consistancy within the series as a whole, but I regret that I do not see this mini-series as filling the background of the previous books, but instead as a seperate 'mayhavebeen' parallel storyline."
5,Great switch,"Used Velcro to mount by bedroom door. Makes it safer to enter the bedroom at night. Having two different lamps plugged in, gives us both an opportunity to turn our own light on/off."
4,Great fun but with a troublesome anti-urban bias.,"My two-year-old loved Burton's ""Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel"" and is equally fond of this one. Burton has a talent for expressing our ambivalence about technology and progress, and leaves the reader both thrilled and saddened by the urbanization of the area surrounding the Little House. In general, though, the message is an anti-urban one, which makes a city dweller like me slightly worried about sending my son the wrong message"
4,Great old fashioned tale,"My children loved this book, so I purchased it for my granddaughter. I hope she will learn to love it as they did. Only issue is that I did not notice that it was a paperback. Small detail"
3,Careful what you ask for,"The story of The Little House Her Story was a story wonderful to use in many age groups and for many ways in a classroom. The story sends a message of being careful what you wish for and about family values. The grandfather cared for his family so much that he wanted to make sure this house would last a lifetime. He built it so that noone could take away a gift that would outlast his time on Earth. Outside of that idea, you also have the idea of the house wanting more for herself and becoming uncomfortable. Then when she gets to move to the city as she hoped, all she did was hope for her peace and quiet back that she had in the country. This lesson is very important in any stage of a child or adults life. There are a million activities one could do with this book and as a a teacher, I would have students look up the history of their house and find out all the neat little things you just never think about. This book was wonderfully written and perfectly illustrated."
5,Do yourself a huge favor....,"Read this book! Rainy Lake is easily the best book I've ever read. I read it for the first time about 4 years ago and I loved it, but it is one of those books that you find yourself thinking about without really realizing it. When I do realize I'm thinking about it, I usually come here to see if Mary has come out with a new novel yet. Similar to ""The Prince of Tides"", but less predictable. It makes you feel either happy or sad, you're not quite sure; if you do feel sad, it feels good to feel sad."
5,Bull's Eye Investing Review,"John Mauldin is an excellent writer and gives excellent advice, as well as a better understanding of the market action."
2,Too Repetitive,"This book makes some excellent points about the many ways that so-called investment advisors will use (lies, damn lies and ) statistics to convince you to either buy and hold or buy yesterday's news today - the trouble is that it makes the same points over and over and over and over. For the price, it is not a good investment. John Mauldin writes an excellent weekly column that is free, and I read regularly. So, the overly simplified and repetitive (did I say that already?) nature of this book was really disappointing."
2,poor quality MP3,"This MP3 is coded at a low bit rate. Music's great, not the sound. Since the CD has a catalog error, the MP3 seems to be the only way to get ""Exploring The Future."""
3,Interesting slice of 50's consumerism,"This has become an outdated book long ago but still is interesting in that it gives a look at life, marketing, and the shady side of business as it existed in the 1950's. Reading about how a car dealer bumps your car payment from $49 to $89 per month, or how siding / encyclopedia / Bible / etc. salesman play their tricks on the public of those days, makes for a bit of escapist reading, from our current era of nonstop 'crises' and global warming etc. etc. A look back at crooked and shady business practices, even outdated it's still worth a flip through."
2,"Not ""the"" Julie Andrews...","First and foremost, Amazon is listing this item as starring Julie Andrews. This is misleading, because Dame Julie Andrews (of THE SOUND OF MUSIC, et all) is not a performer on this CD. The Julie Andrews on this recording is a bassoon player, and merely a member of the ensemble that performs the background music here.The actual ""performer"" here is Harry Enfield, narrating two ""re-told"" fairy tales. I'm not sure who the target audience is for this CD -- the narration is interspersed with instrumental music sections, and these music sections are quite lengthy. I would imaging that small children would lose interest quickly during these long segments without dialogue. Musically speaking, the instrumental passages are pleasant, but certainly not exciting or interesting, so this CD isn't exactly of interest to adults who are serious music fans.Just don't buy this CD expecting to hear something new from Julie Andrews -- she's nowhere to be found."
4,Its Value is more than its Worth,"palmOne Treo 650 PDA PhoneMy palmone 650 is the ideal phone for me, I have all of the information that I need, available when I need it and I can easily update it from either of my laptops.The phone works well and is very durable, as an active person its durability was important to me. This was not my first palm product so I knew that the product was a tested thought out product. I love it.Forget all of the fancy products out there, buy something that has value to your daily productivity accomplishments."
1,"Unreliable, trash","I have a Treo 650 from work. It is my second, the first died due to some software issue that could not be fixed. The new one is acceptably reliable but prone to freezing and lacking response.The Palm O/S simply does not work as it should. The phone allegedly allows the power off feature to be adjusted from 30 sec to 4 mins, they lie. Regardless of what the phone is set to it will shut down after a few seconds of inattention, even fully charged in the middle of downloading a Web page.The browser is abysmal. There is no cache so each time a link is followed the parent is lost. This means that browsing lists of articles takes twice as long as it should as the index has to be reloaded each time.The phone interaction is bizarely illogical, particularly selecting a call from the call log to redial."
3,I love my Treo but there are lots of issues...,I was certain that I would rate my Treo with 5 stars but I've had too many issues. First was that my phone would freeze when receiving calls via Bluetooth. Also the power button would sometimes fail to turn on the unit.I got a replacement unit and now it freezes while left on a charger. I'm going to get another replacement.And it is a bit flaky with occasional freezes etc. but I don't mind that so much. I sure hope that Palm can produce a Treo someday that is Rock Solid Reliable.
3,Earphone Jack problem,"This was a replacement from Amazon for the original order a month before this. The first unit started giving voice trouble due to fault in the ear-phone jack. Continous use of corded ear-phone confuses the hardware even when the ear-phone cable is removed and then you cannot hear anything or the party at the other end hear you. Once you have this problem, the handset will only work with the corded earphone. Did some research on the web of Treo users and found it as a common problem.Moved to a bluetooth headset with the new instrument. Working well so far. The phone overall is good; but this hardware problem on a new phone is not acceptable and worthy of a brand like Palm.Amazon Service was great; the replacement was smooth; and customer service and user experience was what I tell my friends ""Amazing Amazon""."
1,NOT PLEASED AT ALL!!!!!!!,"Since I purchased this unlocked phone, I've been having nothing but problems with it. The reception with this phone is awful and it doesn't stay on long at all after its fully charge. It's a touch screen phone but the screen doesn't work at all. I have to keep taking the battery in and out in order for the phone to even stay on for 30 minutes. I've had a TREO 650 before and it wasn't giving me any of these problems like this one. I've been trying to get in contact with you all about sending me another TREO 650 unlocked phone or refunding my money, but as I thought, no response to my e-mails. If this doesn't get posted, I will defintely understand why because you all probably want to keep selling defected products online. Can someone please respond to my concerns regarding this phone and/or purchase?"
1,disappointment,I was very excited about the prospect of owning a smartphone. This phone has proved unreliable. It requires frequent resets to work. Often simply moving to vibrate mode is enough to make the features not function properly. The phone is not useful. The processor is very slow. Once you are locked into the contract you are stuck with the phone. Caveat emptor!!!
2,No WiFi,"I was going to buy one of these but then realised there is no WiFi support which is crazy since the LifeDrive from Palm has WiFi.My guess is that they have decided not to put WiFi in to please cellular operators. I've watched others with Windows CE WiFi phones place free Skype calls over WiFi. I wanted the same facility.Without WiFi you are locked to the operator for expensive and slow data transfer, and massively high data roaming rates.I'm so sick of waiting for Palm to release a combined PDA+phone that can access the Internet via WiFi (or WiMax later) that I am now considering going against my principles and buying a Windows CE based phone.And going by the other reviews it seems Palm have no fixed the problem I have with my current Palm phone+PDA (Tungsten W) the SIM card is held by a trap door which is a terrible design. It means you are plagued with dropped calls or the device being disconnected because the SIM has lost contact."
5,The definitive 'desert island' classical guitar book,"This is a collection of studies for the ages. Not only is each one slightly more challenging than the last, encouraging a sequential skill-building approach, but almost everyone except for the first few is musically great, a true performance piece.The fingering indications are left as the original composer intended. Noad has done a masterful job selecting and organizing these 100 studies from the vast number out there. Carcassi's great 25 studies are all here. Sor's ""20 Segovia"" studies are here (save one or two), much more by Sor, and some great pieces by Guiliani. I have literally scores of books of studies and this is the only one I ever feel like using. Unless you are near virtuoso or a complete beginner, this book will fit the bill as no other. It's the definitive desert island classical guitar book. (Requires music reading ability, No TAB)."
4,Schubert interpreted by Janowitz,"Schubert had a talent for transmitting complex emotions through his music and had he lived longer would, I believe, have at least equaled if not surpassed the likes of Beethoven. Dame Janowitz used her vocal talents to interpret and transmit those emotions Herr Schubert set to paper in these lovely recordings made while she was still in her prime."
5,solid,"every one of their albums is solid, and this is no exception. it's their 'major label' debut (and finale), so it's a little more tame than previous efforts, and ones that followed, but it's ear candy.but do yourself a favour... go buy this on e-bay. TVT printed 100,000 or so copies and flooded record stores with it, but it only sold about 25,000, so there's tonnes out there. average price on e-bay is about $0.99 US.dig."
1,How much aggravation can you stand?,"I only rated this with one star because I couldn't use zero. In truth, the cap does lock - that's the only positive aspect. This cap is difficult to use in every way imaginable, from inserting the key to figuring-out whether it is in fact locked or not. I'm ready to go back to an unlocked cap due to the repeated hassles."
2,High class boredom,"Tortured Neil Diamond (and wannabe Waits) vocals and pristinely produced stringed synths can become rote along this hour plus release of dark dance, but as the lead-off title track suggests, there are songs worth mining here."
5,Fantastic!,Heard about this from a friend. It's awesome and impossible to classify. Hope there's more coming soon.
3,"Not for children, but recomended for other reasons.","I read this book in 1992, as a third grader when it was first published. I will state what other reviewers have...this book is NOT suitable for children under the age of 12. It gave me nightmares and for years, I had been terrified of taking showers probably since the gas chambers as described in this book sound like the shower stalls that we use each and every day, something that would scare a young child. No child should have to go through being that terrified due to reading a book marketed for children.On the other hand, the information in this book combined with that in Mrs. Leitner's other books forms an interesting true story of a family trapped during the Holocaust in Hungary. I recommend this book soley for that reason alone."
3,"Not for children, excellent for low literacy adults","This review is mixed...thus an inaccurate rating of 5---I'd rather select a 1 for children, and a 10 for low literacy adults.The Big Lie is written at a 3rd grade reading level, but IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. It describes the author's experiences during the Holocaust with such detail and bluntness that children will have nightmares. BUT if the book is used to teach low literacy adults about the Holocaust, it is an excellent resource! The moral to the story is: Never judge a book strictly by its reading level!"
3,I wish it was thicker with information,"Not much to say, there are lots of repetitions in the book and the suggestions can be read in many pregnancy websites. The book is peaceful but limited, I expected a little more."
3,somewhat satisfied,"I bought these shoes because they were advertised to be comfortable for those with bunions. Although the shoes seem to have stretched after many uses, they do not have enough elasticity in the bunion area. They are comfortable in all other areas and offer good support."
1,Nettle Tea,"Still getting used to this product. I am told it has great health giving qualities, not convinced yet."
3,"Good, but doesn't replace hands-on experience","This book is an excellent source of information on the test information, but don't rely on it to pass the exam."
3,Good ...but not on Subnetting,The TCP/IP exam cram prep guide is ok to supplement other study guides and will definetly help you pass the TCP/IP 4.0 NT exam but the section on subnetting lacks a clear explanation of basic subnetting. I suggest the SYBEX study guide and other online materials for understanding subnetting. Otherwise it will help you in your TCP/IP 4.0 certification endeavours.
4,Clever and usefull. Lightweight.,Great for golfing and soccer. It occupies very minimal space in my trunk. This is really useful when you have to change location very often like on a parade. It is not heavy and bulky to carry around.Pros:- Very clever- Light and very portable- Folding and very little space for storage- It is also a walking stickCons:- Uncomfortable for very long sitting- Not as stable as a 4-legged chair
3,LIKE THEM,"LOANED TO CO-WORKER AND ID DID A GOOD JOB ON CAR HE POLISHED,I JUST HOPE I HAVE TIME TO USE SOON."
2,"There is good information, but it's hard to swallow","I was asked to read this book by a marriage counselor that both my husband and I are seeing. She warned me that there will be a lot I don't like in the book but there was also some good information in it.After digging through all the jabs at women, feminism, and evil liberals I'm able to say that I did find a few good things in the book. The problem is having to force yourself to get past Dr. Laura's hateful attitude towards women and anyone who doesn't agree with her.She lacks any type of respect for people like not her and it really diminishes the value of the book. It's unfortunate, could she have learned to be more respectful towards all people then this book would have been fantastic."
2,hmmmm...,"Not to sure on how to rate Dr. Laura. My husband even listens to her on Sirius XM Radio and he's the one that suggested I read this book. Now I know why! :/ She has good intentions, but I don't agree with all of her views."
1,Complete waste of time,"I found this book sensationalistic and the title in particular designed for shock value, of which Dr. Laura is a master. Dr. Laura puts the onus of responsibility for the relationship on the woman when the reality is anything but that. It takes two responsible, respectful individuals to make a relationship work. Period.Anything ""helpful"" Dr. Laura has to say is flat out common sense that you can aquire for free. Everything else is mindless fluff that's at best useless and at worst offensive and misleading.Bottom line: if your marriage or relationship is in trouble, this book won't help. If it's not, then this book won't do you any good and you don't need it anyway."
2,"Not horrible, but not great","I just finished reading this. It one of those books with a cute title meant to hook people into an impulse buy. Then you read it and you feel like your are reading a bunch of Dear Abby collumns thrown together to make a book.I've read worse and some people might like it. Frankly there is no real advice here for a married couple. However there are a few funny spots. I regret paying money for it, so I suggest getting it from the library."
2,Manipulative beasts vs. idiotic puppets,"Sometimes Dr. Laura makes sense. Other times, she conjures up the image in my head of a wombat with gills that emit crazy gas. I think Dr. Laura would rather no other women ever go to college again, so she is the only woman with a profession, and a life of her own. What a hypocrite."
2,A little too hard core for me,"I truly enjoyed and got a lot out of Dr. Laura's Proper Care And Feeding Of Marriage, however The Proper Care And Feeding Of Husbands is a bit insulting to women. I've actually been the wife who's husband had an affair and I can honestly say, I didn't drive him to it.... What are you thinking Dr. Laura?"
5,Food for Thought,"This book is the Care and Feeding of Husbands, but it gave ME some food for thought! I realize that some of the things that are suggested in this book may seem taboo to any feminists out there, but to me as I read, it was more like common sense. Pretty much Dr. Laura says treat your husband as you would like to be treated. If you want to be treated like the Queen of the castle, treat your husband like the King! As a woman who appreciates traditional gender roles, this should be easier for me, but pride is always a factor, when it shouldn't be. Read this book! You may be totally surprised how simple it can be to make a change!"
5,"Like all good medicine, it doesn't go down well","I am an ultra liberal, take charge, kick *ss and take names later kinda gal, but I want to assure you, like a bad pill, this book works wonders and is the perfect remedy for many relationship flaws women unsuspectingly inject into what would otherwise be perfect relationships. Let me also say, I hate Dr Laura because she tells it like it is and you can either take it or leave it (too much like me, lol). However,as far as books go in telling you how to keep a man, this is the gold standard and you MUST OWN THIS BOOK if you are married or in a serious relationship and I love this book and it has done wonders for me and my relationship (even though I did buy the kindle edition because I didn't want my friends to know I'm reading it, lol)"
4,Laura is good,However instead of increasing the quantity of her books she should rather improve the quality. This is a difficult test for a successful authpor whose books are bought notwhistanding the level of its quality.
3,Great Material,"The only negative with this audio book is: the audio book has omitted a lot of stuff that the book had in it.. I found myself referring to the book inorder to not miss anything from it, other than that it is awesome just like Dr Laura's book...."
1,"""Working Women are Evil and Wrong""","I only got through about an hour of reading this book. The author is completely warped. She should have titled the book, ""Working Women are Evil and Wrong"". She railed on and on about how women who work are selfish. I have news for you, Dr. Laura; the majority of American families cannot survive on one income. Get a clue.A few days ago, I read, ""Babyproofing Your Marriage"" and ""The Five Love Languages"". These books were much more helpful and productive."
4,Right on the money,"It is such a blessing that Dr. Laura is in session on the radio to offer her expertise! I LOVE listening on my way to pick up my kids from school.I have almost completed this book and enjoy reading what she says daily on her show. She is always consistant in her advise, like I wrote right on the money!!!! Listening to her reinforces my morals and values and makes me a better wife and mother!!"
3,Average Beach Ball,Shipped quickly. Nothing special but gets the job done. As long as your careful with it they will last a while.
3,Ul De Rico Rocks!,Not a nearly the visual feast that The Rainbow Goblins is. Beautiful none the less. FYI - Ul De Rico created many of the creatures and help create the visuals for The Never Ending Story (the movie). One of my favorites.
1,Not what I expected,"The cd did not work (and I tried it on several computers), and the images in the book are not as clear as I would have expected. It was a good idea, but the quality of the product leaves much to be desired."
5,Deserving of your time,"Having read Mr Graziano's other poetry collections, I was excited by the prospect of this new one. I have come to trust Graziano's writing implicitly and Honey, I'm Home does not disappoint. It is another wonderful collection of this insightful poet's triumphs, trials, tribulations, thoughts and observations. Whether you have sought this book out, have not read any poetry in a while or not at all - I would urge anyone to spend the $$$ and get this book."
1,Platform DEPENDANT OpenGL,"If you are interested in cross-platform OpenGL programming then DO NOT buy this book, it is M$ Windows Dependant. The title should have been ""Beginning OpenGL Windows Game Programming""."
4,Love these shoes!,"Bought these shoes to replace some cheaper ones I had purchased several years earlier. Unlike the previous ones, my feet don't sweat or feel cold in the Jungle Mocs. Sizing is good. They are comfortable to wear all day while walking around, the price was excellent and I love the color! (Cordovan!) These shoes are comfortable right from the box...no ""break-in"" time! I would have given them 5 stars but I'm waiting to see how they look after some snow, road salt and wear."
5,Most comfy shoe ever,"This is my 5th pair of jungle mocs - I'll admit I'm an addict! No, these are not the sexiest shoe out there, in fact they are pretty macho. However, since I am on my feet all day, comfort wins over high fashion."
5,Nice shoes,"Great shoes, very comfortable. My wife is happy, so you want the same shoe in another color. Excelent quality. Thanks."
1,Do NOT BY THE BLU-RAY version of this film,"The movie itself is great and you should definately watch it.What you should NOT do is buy this Blu-Ray disc which has approximate 10 minutes of UNSKIPPABLE trailers and then to add injury to insult, after you, a paying customer has bought the disc and shown you are one of the good guys they make you watch a UNSKIPPABLE ""don't pirate movies"" propaganda piece effectively calling you a criminal!!!Pop the disc in and you will not be able to watch the movie for at least 10 minutes. Everyone who bought this disc should return it until the studios get the message."
4,Movies,The movie was good with a lot of twist the only thing is there is one part that is not believable.
2,Rather depressing movie.,"I have enjoyed most all of the movies that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have done, so I thought that with the two of them together this film would be a great one. It wasn't. I couldn't keep track of the plot after a certain point, and it quickly devolved into the two of them just trying to one-up each other, like two kids arguing over whose dad is better. I never felt any positive emotions from anyone and I ended the movie feeling kind of depressed. Not the way I like to leave a movie. It was also incredibly dark during certain parts which made it a little more difficult to see what was going on. Mainly, this movie confused and upset me."
5,A Must Have !!!!,From the opening shot it has you. On a rollercoaster and never lets go. Bale and Jackman are fantastic as always.
3,Magicians are cool...,"I like movies about magicians. I like movies I can't predict well. Not only is 'The Prestige' an unpredictable movie about magicians, but the acting is well above par. Especially Hugh Jackman. His best performance up to date. And while I hated Christian Bale in his 'Batman' persona...he covered alot of ground making up for it in this piece."
4,Requires another viewing to catch all the intracacies...,"I can see where THE PRESTIGE, a very cunning piece of work, is going to require future viewings for me to fully grasp the story which is so intricate that reviewing it is more difficult than usual.For the sake of brevity, let me say that it's all about illusions in the dark world of magic in the 18th Century theater world. The period atmosphere is captured completely so that London of that era is beautifully rendered in low key lighting effects. The performances are all of the highest caliber, including the principal jobs by HUGH JACKMAN and CHRISTIAN BALE as magicians jealous of each other's talent.All the other roles are played well but it's MICHAEL CAINE in a peripheral part that stands out the most.There's an absorbing mystery at the heart of the tale and a plot twist that some may have guessed long before it happens, but it's the kind of film you can enjoy on a different level the second or third time.Summing up: Definitely worth viewing."
3,At War With Wizards...,"A decent little film that will keep you entertained, even if you, like I, work out the twist in the first five minutes. It goes off on a completely different tack from Christopher Priest's novel, but in a very interesting way (and to the point that even the author apparently prefers Nolan's vision of the concept to his own). Michael Caine does his usual splendid job of subtly stealing every scene that he's in from the two leads and David Bowie makes a beautifully underplayed cameo appearance as Nikola Tesla."
4,The Prestige,"This movie definitely keeps you interested. Once you finish it, you will want to watch it over and over. Hugh Jackman and Christain Bale both did a wonderful job. The movie arrived quickly and undamaged."
5,Love this movie!,"This is a fantastic movie, cheaper price than what I saw in the store. Arrived when it was supposed to."
2,Great stars clever twists,"I do not have the enthusiasm in this movie as other reviewers. I watched The Illusionist and liked that so I bought this when it was released. I didn't know what to expect, it was a clever movie with great stars but it seemed to lack something. I liked the Illusionist better and not because it's a 'chick' flick because I don't go for those. It took a bit to get in to The Presteige and by the end I was bothered by the outcome. I will have to watch it a second time to see if I can come to a better feeling about the movie but until I do, I am disappointed. I don't care for happy endings either but I cannot think of what I'd have hoped the outcome to be.Maybe if... No I wont say it because I don't want to spoil the movie!Sorry this review is simply on my opinions rather than important specs of the movie. It is good enough to give it another chance though so I will watch it again and hope I will enjoy it more."
2,A good way to be put to sleep,"The prestige is an utterly boring movie. It takes a really long time for the story to develop. By time it does you are almost asleep. I was excited to see this movie due to hugh jackman and christian bale being in them. But when I actually saw the movie I was extremely disappointed. My recommendation is avoid this movie. if you want to see a decent movie that has a magician theme to it, check out The Illusionist."
3,Disappointing,"Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. ""The Prestige,"" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no ""Memento""; it's not even a ""Batman Begins.""What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity."
4,It keeps your eyes glued,"I truely enjoyed this movie. This movie has everything you would want in a great flim. Action,suspense,drama and a unpredictable ending. So put it in your dvd player and hang on for the ride."
2,Why do they explain everything at the end???,"Let me just say that I loved Memento. Part of that movie's appeal is that they don't spoon feed you everything at the end but rather provide hints that leaves the viewer to try to unravel it's mysteries and inspires one to watch the movie multiple times to try to figure it out. The Prestige is frustrating as it had the potential to provide the same experience, but instead everything is explained to you at the end. The movie provided enough subtle hints to allow the viewer the fun of trying to solve the film on their own, while debating the possibilities with friends. I felt robbed. My suggestion to viewers is to turn off the movie with @ 5 minutes left and attempt to figure it out on your own....Are you watching closely? - No need to do so if you watch the movie to it's disappointing finale..."
1,WITHOUT Prestige!,"Utterly AMATEURISH production, with the attempts of the two ""leading"" characters to play ""Doubles"" of themselves, SO Bad, that it MUST have been DELIBERATELY so, in order to give the Movie a ""Tongue-in-Cheek"" quality!The ONLY saving grace, is the ever DELECTABLE appearance of Scarlett Johannson."
5,Simply the Best,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. Even if you guess some of the surprises during the film, keep watching. You won't guess everything. I thought I had it figured out, but continued to be very surprised, all the way up until the shocking ending! Then I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale offscreen, but I have to give it to him; he does whatever it takes to bring his characters to life. He is a great actor and really goes the extra mile for his audience. The entire cast does a wonderful job with this one. No complaints. And that's not something I say about a movie very often."
5,Engrossing twists and turns,"The ""prestige"" is the finale of a magic trick--the ""AHA"" moment when the escape artist extricates himself, the disappearing man appears in another location, the sawn-in-half woman is whole again. In this story a finale goes terribly wrong, and two partners embark on a deadly rivalry to be the first to perform the ultimate trick. The plot twists and turns in ways I certainly couldn't forsee, but I left the film not only puzzling over what had really happened, but more interestingly, wondering what was going on inside the heads of these two men as they lived the lives they had created for themselves. There's no real winner here; rather we see a tense pyschological battle that leads to more than one deadly end. Comparisons to ""The Illusionist"" are inevitable, but these are two entirely different movies. Enjoy them both!"
3,Not as pictured,"The product in the picture is not the product you get. The difference in the picture from what I received is that the picture has 3 tall track risers, 8 sloped curved tracks and 8 curved tracks. What I got was only 1 tall track riser, 6 sloped curved tracks and 10 curved tracks. Everything else was correct. According to the box I received my product was complete. It seems that the picture on Amazon is not correct. All in all it's still a lot of track for the price but Amazon needs to change the image they show."
2,A big disappointment,"I really like Bendis' work on Ultimate Spider-Man, so I was suprised how uninteresting I found Powers. The characters are one-dimensional, the gritty-cop-feel very forced, the supers themselves uninteresting, and the crimes and criminals cliche. Most importantly, our ace detectives Walker and Deena don't actually solve any of the murders, even in the bonus Previews material; the perp or a witness literally just shows up and explains what happened. There are no suprises. The sequencing of the panels also jumps all over the place, which had me pausing to re-read pages constantly.In the end, I opted to return this book and grab Invincible, Vol. 2 instead. A far better comic, IMO."
3,rusted,"I have had this slow cooker for 2-3 years and it works well except that it leaks a lot of water from around the lid. The water runs down the sides and collects along the bottom edge resulting in rusting. There is now a ring of rust around the entire pot. Before this cooker, I was using a Crockpot my parents received in 1976 as a wedding present and never had a problem until the day it just wouldn't turn on. I chose this pot because of the great experience with the brand, but obviously the quality of design & materials has decreased significantly. I am not going to buy another Crockpot."
4,Significant updgrade,"I am very happy with this purchase. The battery lasted around twice as long as the stock battery. With my normal usage, the stock battery lasted 24 hours at most and I got 48 hours out of this one.The only downside is that the battery makes the phone bulkier. For me, having the significantly extended battery life was worth the extra weight.Bottom line: definitely a good purchase if you are frustrated with the stock battery life"
1,Beware! This is not a music CD,"Okay, it's my own fault for not listening to the tracks before buying this cd. However, I don't see anywhere on this product description that says this is an audio blog. I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake I did and buy the cd just because it has Kelly Clarkson's name on it."
1,A big waste of money.,Could not have been more disappointed (and angry for spending my money). Don't bother with this one.
3,Good,"YES! This is a biography CD from the UK, BUT I think the UK narrators, put effort and research, but YES the person who rated it a one star, not to be mean, but the person was mistakened... and thought they were her songs, which there not but would be cool. If you wanna know the 411 on Kelly, then this is the CD to buy. I love KELLY, she rules!"
2,Substandard Manufacturing & Quality,"I concur with another less than desirable review of this product. This is suppossed to be a Delta Part not an aftermarket product. The fit of this cast aluminium piece in the cast iron table is deplorable. I seriously question what if any fit tolerances were permitted. However, being in need of an operatational saw and drawing on several years metal machining experience I managed to make it work. I am very dissapointed with both the quality of the materials and manufacturing of a relativley simple yet expensive replacement part."
2,Not like the original,"The new insert had a very loose fit with more than a 1/16"" gap. Also the top (working area) was not flat by about 1/16"". I could have installed some setscrews around the perimeter and flat sanded the top to fix these problems but instead sent it back. I fixed my original Delta insert which had cracked with some JB weld. In the long run this was less trouble and was a less expensive solution."
2,disappointing,"we all have good memories of the oregon trail game.....it should be left as that...a memory. it was good while it lasted and then it was over. all the features are the same but the people are repetitive and the whole trail its repetitive. after all the advancements in pc games, the oregon trail is like frogger, its nostalgic but you can't sit there for hours and play it (or minutes)."
4,Oregon Trail,Oregon Trail was a favorite of our family (young and old)years ago . Bought OT V5 for Christmas for my teenager and 10 yr old. It was sort of meant as a joke but now all her teenage friends come over to enjoy the game! It's almost a mini-cult following!!Very educational and entertaining.
2,Nothing like the original,"Frankly, this game was nothing like the original played on the Apple II. There are a lot of people who say they grew up playing The Oregon Trail, bought this for the nostalgia, and loved it, but I don't agree at all. Those people were either playing a different version or optimists.The CD Rom I got came with no instructions so it was difficult to navigate the game. I didn't know how to get in and out of the general stores or what the point was of exploring the forts. I think some of the new features and games made it extremely tedious. I suppose a longer playing time is good and makes the game worth the money, but I just couldn't get over the disappointment of it not being enough like the original."
1,NOT FOR WINDOWS XP,CAN'T INSTALL OR PLAY ON WINDOWS XP. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS CHILDHOOD GAME WITH MY SON.
1,"Did not run, never got to use the product","Very disappointed in this product. Never got the program to run despite several attempts to fix the problem. Even with help from the publisher, it still did not work with MS XP pro. Sorry I bought it."
1,Oregon Trail 5th Edition,I ordered Oregon Trail 5th Edition and it simply would not work on my computer. I tried all fixes to no avail. I have XP.The product was delivered promptly in good condition and I was able to return with no problem.I would reccomend this vendor
4,Fun for the computer,My son has had a ball using this product. It's interesting and allows for a lot of creativity and funs.
3,Yes it is like the game of your childhood,"I had to have this game, it just reminded me of computer class in 3rd grade, However beware this game has glitches it stopes in the middle and freezes your entire computer, Soo annoying and it does not save so you have to reboot your computer and start all over again. I have windows XP so BEWARE, not worth the aggrevation."
1,Don't Buy if you Have a MAC,"This game maybe fun, but if you have a MAC with OS 10, forget about playing. This game runs on a font no longer available to MAC users, so its basically useless."
3,Does run on newer iMac with OS X 10.5 if ...,"This version of Oregon Trail will run on a new mac running OS X 10.4 or 10.5 if you can get a copy of the New York font from an older mac and copy it onto your newer mac. It does have problems with the sound, however. If you turn the music off, it is usable, although not great.So if you have a new mac, don't waste your money unless 1) you really, really want this game, 2) you can find the new york font and know how to install it, and 3) you are willing to put up with poor sound."
3,Fun and Educational,I have fond memories of playing this game in school with my friends. We would all gather round the computer and play as ourselves and see who would make it. One friend in particular would die every time of disentary. Lots of fun. Learn about the wagon train era and hunt for things......thats an educational/entertaining game....lol...
2,Beware OS X users,"This software will only work on Mac OS X if you have also installed ""Classic"", which is a program that allows you to use programs prior to this operating system (such as 8.6-9.2). The needed New York font is not available unless you have classic, so my children cannot even play this."
2,will not work on Mac OSX Lion,"When I had snow leopard on my mac it worked but was a bit buggy. But since I installed Lion, I cannot play the game at all. Apparently this game is a power PC application which is no longer supported in OSX Lion"
3,for mac,"if i had paid more than five dollars total (the software was .99) i would be upset. i had to download special fonts, the game cant be run while other apps are being use and it is nothing at all like the old oregon trail.disappointing!"
3,Bought this for my son...,"...to play on his Xbox 360. He tried playing it and it didn't work. I know it's not the cassette drive on the Xbox, because it plays other games perfectly fine.It's too bad, because this game looked more educational than Grand Theft Halo (and less violent, too!)"
4,Raw power-pop,"This follow-up to the Memphis band's 1997 debut ""Blindfolds and Cigarettes"" is a more loose, spontaneous effort, with unvarnished standouts such as the Kinksy ""Day's Too Slow,"" ""Bananas Foster,"" and the darkly brooding ""Remorse Code."""
3,Buy something else,"I've had this for several months,and wish I had spent either more for a good machine like the La Pavoni.I had a La Pavoni and should have had it rebuilt.I had a Starbucks espresso machine for a couple of years to tide me over and it was better in all ways compared to the Rancillo.That machine was half the price.All this ""temperature surfing ""is time consuming and not all that effective.I'm constantly adding water to the water tank.The plastic medallion on the steam knob is falling off now,and if I glue it in place I would cover up the screw for the handle.I wish this machine would just die,then I could justify buying a good La Pavoni,or a less expensive Cuisinart thatI could care less about."
1,Can't Get It To Work,Getting an espresso out of this machine is impossible. I tried all kinds of combinations - either it comes out watery or it drips out so slowly that it is cold before you have a chance to drink it. Choose another machine.
1,Do your research before buying,"I returned this item the next day.Details: Does not perform as advertised. Steam function is noisy, weak, and ergonomically awkward. Machine is very loud and slow in operation. Instructions are vague and uninformativeSilvia Version 3 in Stainless Steel"
5,Helps the caregiver cope too.,"This is an excellent book about the realities of living with a hidden disability and loving someone who is disabled. I heard the author give a book talk recently and I was impressed by her groundedness. She is not interested in blaming the ill person and addresses the real issues of trying to work, having a social life, dealing with doctors and just plain trying to make it through a day. This is the best book I have read on the subject and I have read many."
5,Superb,"This is a terrific book for anyone with a hidden disability. The book is very well written and is coming to you straight from someone who knows themselves how difficult it is to live with hidden disabilities. It is very thorough and deals with different personality types and situations.As a previous writer wrote for everyone who made a silly suggestion to me regarding my sleeping problems (not understanding its severity) I would have filled up enough pages to write a book. She talks about the many different types of responses one recieves with a hidden disability and nails it so eloquently.She is right there with us and offers great ideas of how to get by how to deal with Drs. Friends and Family, and Coworkers. There is so much support that a person with a hidden disability does not recieve and this book is a gift for anyone with one as it really is helpful."
3,"A somewhat top-heavy, ponderous book","As a graduate student in technical communication, I've been required to use this book as a course text. I can assure you few students referred to it regularly.As a professional tech writer, I still keep it on the shelf. For a book on document design, this does not appear to be the best example. If you want to scan for the salient points, this book is not for you. The 600 pages are very crowded and, though there is lots of good information in it, you have to do some digging. I wouldn't use this book as my only resource on the subject. If you add this one to your library, consider including books by Roger C. Parker and Robin Williams to complement to this volume."
1,Horrible!,"This ""cart cover"" is very poorly designed. The padding is useless and completely pointless. We have to bring blankets and extra cushioning. I don't even know why they bothered. Also, good luck trying to the get the velcro to stay in place. I'm curious as to what grocery cart they thought this cover could fit on. It has yet to fit any grocery cart we have put our son in. This was a baby shower gift and I wish we had just returned it to the store before opening it. My mother-in-law ended up making her own cart cover and we are exploring other options as well. Don't waste your money!"
3,Good but not great,"I bought this for my five month old since she's starting to sit up and is starting to get too big for her carrier. So I needed something comfortable to put her in since she won't be riding in her carrier connected to the cart. My daughter enjoys it but I don't! It usually takes me about five minutes to get it just right in the seat and her all buckled. I'm hoping with time, I'll be able to just put it in the cart and buckle her with no problems. I would like it better if it had padding on the sides so when she topples over she does't hurt herself."
1,No good...,This thing was awful. I bought it and planned to shop that day. It kept sliding off and it does not cover the sides of the cart. I saw another Mom shopping and she had the one with the elastic. She had also tried this one ONCE and then returned it. I am returning this today!
1,very bad experience...Old and used product,i really got a bad experience after bought this product.Trimmer was looks old and used. And after using it i felt itchy on my skin.I was trying to return this product but i didn't got any reply from retailer.it was such a bad experience.
4,works pretty well,"Hair finisher works pretty good. It trims closer than regular hair clippers. It does require going over the same spot multiple times to actually trim all of the hair in the area. Basically it works, but it's tedious since I have to go over each spot multiple times to actually trim all of the hair."
1,wasted money,"my barber had purchased a new pair of clippers and gave my the old pair of beard trimmers. i used them until the trimmers stopped working. i checked out amazon for a new pair and found what i thought was the same model. i plugged the new trimmers in and it didn't make a sound. i thought to myself that was awesome, a nice pair of silent trimmers. i put them to my face and the oster trimmers grabbed every hair on my face. the trimmers couldn't even make a straight cut. it took me three times as long to trim my beard. $40 bucks wasted. now i have to get another brand of trimmers. i couldn't be more pissed with a product."
5,Perfect little shaver,"I had an older version of this same shaver, which worked flawlessly for me for over 8 years. This new one has a slightly darker red body and has a label that looks like it won't fade as easy as my old one. I love this little shaver, because it's so much more quieter than my Whal Peanut. The blades are easy to replace also. I hope you enjoy yours like I enjoy mine."
1,Poor vocal performances,"This recording is marred by poor vocal performances. Alexandra Marc is a blowsy and unsubtle Elektra. Deborah Voigt is a matronly and unfeeling Chrysothemis. Hanna Schwarz is well past her prime as a shaky Klytemnestra. Ramey is a wobbly Orestes and Jerusalem a caricature of an Aegisth. Sinopoli conducts with energy, but his interpretation does not yield any significant insights. Quite a disappointing recording."
3,Unique Learning Experience,There are some unique and interesting applications for everyday items. Have not tried them yet but I will to see if they actually work. Worth a read
2,Not quite,This book bills itself as a super simple way to do really cool science activities. Most of the activities I tried were an ABSOLUTE FAILURE. You can look most of these up online and get better instructions. I do not recommend.
3,Sneaky Uses for Everyday Things,"I won't be using a lot of the projects for daily use. It is entertaining reading, though, and a good conversation started."
3,"Not as great as it sounds, but useful nonetheless","I thought it was going to have some extraordinary ways on how to make the gadgets using the household items, but the devices are not very practical or convenient. might be a good space filler in a science class, or ideas for scientific experiments, but nothing i see that could be used in actual situations"
4,"""Sun, Sea, and Lots of Smiles""","There's a lot of smiles on the models in this collection of male nude images and a lot of fun and fooling around for the camera. These photos were taken on a beautiful day at the beach. What beach, I don't know, but I assume it's in Germany, however, I may be wrong. The young men in this collection are good-looking and in great shape. You can tell they had a lot of fun posing for Michael Reh in all of these black & white images. This is another collection published by Bruno Gmunder, who has done a wonderful job in showcasing the current male nude photographers. On a cold winter's day these photos certainly make you want to be on the beach hanging out with these guys in the warm sun. Michael Reh started his photography career in 1998 photographing many celebrities & fashion models. This book brought a smile to my face, and I look forward to Michael's future work. Recommended!"
3,Author Falsifies Her Own Past!,"I will say that this book has the potential for helping people (moms) with anger issues. However, there are some major discrepencies in the stories the author tells of her own past that have turned me off the book completely.On page 68 the author relates a heart wrenching memory in which her 2 younger siblings (ages 4 & 5) are adopted out of the foster home all 3 were living at.At the end of page 70 the author has the audacity to claim she was adopted at the tender age of 3 after spending only a year in foster care.I'm sorry but manufactoring sad scenarioos and passing them off as truth in order to prove a point is wrong. I find it manipulative to say the least. Unfortunately in my eyes it totally discredits the author & her book."
3,"We Don't Have Kids, and It's Still a Good Read","We don't have children, and even I liked this book. Why, because I can use the info in almost any situations that can cause me to wanna BLOW with anger! And Ms. Barnhill is very, very funny. The sad part is, in growing up, I thought a mother's anger, no matter how it's presented, was normal. I thought that harsh words and insults and sneered looks and ultimately denial is what mothers do. Not to Julie, and thank God she has a way of taking a very serious subject and turning it into a very funny book. It's part ""how to"" and part nonfiction essay. She ought to be commended on bravery alone for her self-disclosure, an idea which I'm sure didn't go over well at the dinner table. Note: If you're atheist or agnostic, some material may be a turn off."
3,Not as good as I suspected.,This game is rather easy an does not contain many challenges for my 4-year old. The game was very easy to complete. The game becomes boring rather quickly at times because you had to keep going back and forth from place to place to solve the game. Sometimes you get stuck and am not sure where to go next until you explore some of the places again because the scenes change as the game progresses. The game has excellent graphics and sound but a mediocre story. The game needed more action.
5,Inspiring to All,"Shelley Taylor-Smith's book, Dangerous When Wet, is truly inspirational no matter what type of athlete you are! Reading her book makes me want to go chase after my dreams. She proves to that it doesn't matter where you come from or what your gender, anything can happen if you set your mind to it and believe in yourself! I highly recommend! =)"
1,Poorly constructed and badly written,"Though the books has some interesting ideas about AI, few of these ideas are truly new. There are a lot of tired examples of Machines throwing off the yoke of their human controllers to prove they are worthy of equal consideration. Unfortunately, beyond the plot problem the text is malconstructed, non-logical, and just poorly written. I would not recommend buying this book. If you are truly interested in a book about a budding AI looking for growth in a human world take a look at Isaac Asimov's ""I Robot"" or Roger McBride Allen's ""Caliban""."
4,Great!,"While this game has gotten some bad reviews because it's not a big step up from Spider-Man 2, it's still the best Spider-Man game so far (Spider-Man: We of Shadows looks like it'll take the lead when it comes out in a few weeks). It's a ton of fun to play and the better part is swinging across the city like with Spider-Man 2 and Ultimate Spider-Msn. However with the black suit and better PS3 graphics Spider-Man 3 is superior to the other games. Unfortunately the problems such as not enough variety of missions hasn't been solved so it gets to be a little repetitive after a while, but it's still fun. Plus whenever you get bored from missions just swing around the city and have a good time! It's a fun game that any gamer will love[...]"
2,You just got to be kidding!,$30 for a few strands of silver? Who knows if it even does anything? After paying $150 - $200 for the humidifier they suck another $30 from you every 6 months! Why not just stick an old piece of silver jewelry in the tank (but be sure to clean it every 6 months)?
5,HER BEST YET!!!!,"I've read all three now, and I loved all three, and I am keeping all three! But this one was the best! Marcus and Avalon are _incredible_, so, so sexy, and the romance between them was breathtaking. His wooing of her was both convincing and touching. This lady sure can write!! Passion and emotion and deep, deep intensity. Can't think of another author quite like her out there. Can't wait for more books from her."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed the book. It had a great plot, interesting paranormal abilities and wonderful characters. The heroine was in denial a little too long but came round to face her destiny. I didn't want to have it end."
4,Birkenstocks are great,"I love these sandals. they are comfortable. I had a hard time finding black patent leather in the Washington, DC area (DC, MD and VA). I loved Amazon for carrying them and the price was right!"
1,Probably the worst book I have ever read.,"The author wallows in self pity and is always sick while staying in the best possible hotels (and never fails to drop the names of famous people who have done likewise). Having visited the same sites in Thailand and Cambodia in good health and a tight budget, I am appalled that this experience could be reported in such a distorted and negative way. Only a perverse curiosity about if the book could get worse kept me reading. It did get worse."
2,Weak,"After shown what was possible with Spiderman 2, this game is a BIG let down. The fighting is really boring and the graphics are bland. The webslinging is kind of fun once you get the hang of it, but that's the only good thing I have to say about this game. If you must play it, rent it, absolutely don't buy."
2,Webslinging is fun...nothing else is...,"I just finished the story mode of the game, and I feel that it is sad when you can beat the story and still have 52% left of the game. that to me makes no sense, and I feel that there should be more story then other tasks. The webslining is fun, but it takes a while to learn how to use it effectivly. I also didn't enjoy how the game didn't follow the movie at all. Yes the few villans spiderman fights in the movie are in the game, but the way you fight them, and how they die are completly different. Also they tied in some aspects of the movie that are false in the game (Sandman's daughter). Yes she is a character in the movie, but in the game they changed her character. I also would have like if they would have stuck to the timeline of the movie. The game feels rushed, and it just goes from one thing to the other.Thats my opinion...take it for what its worth.If you want to play...rent...don't buy."
2,Caravans,I did not like this book. I did not find it very entertaining. While it was educational and had good historical information it lacked excitment. The book could not keep me interested. I would have given it a higher rating if it would have had a stronger and more interesting plot.
4,Very good book,"The novel Caravans, was an exciting and educating book to read. Michener writes a great story about a missing girl in Afghanistan and a CIA agent tracking her down. But he delves deep into each character, giving them great personalities, so you never know what's going to happen next. He also writes about the different religions, the society and environment of Afghanistan. He puts a great story together, with of these facts. You can learn a lot about the Afghan culture after World War II and read something entertaining at the same time."
4,Different kind of Michener,"Not at all a historical novel, ""Caravans"" is, regardless, a story about love set in a place of rich historical tradition; Afghanistan. It is the tale of a young American diplomat sent to retrieve an expatriate girl from Pennsylvania who has run off with an Afghan man. Michener weaves around this plot an intertwining love story quite different from the love in ""Caribbean"" or ""Tales of the South Pacific."" Michener's craft is evident as always: he is able to bring life and love out of a barren or hostile climate, in this case the steppes of Central Asia. Not his very best, but short and very enjoyable."
5,Awesome!!,"Thought this was a great read and a fantastic history lesson combined together. highly recommend this to anyone interested in taht region. the last time i read a book like this was leon uris epic on the Jewish migration to israel, and that wasn't nearly as well written. By the way another author I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in contemporary Afghan issues is Rajesh Talwar. I've enjoyed his 'The Sentimental Terrorist' very much. It'll give you a glimpse of contemporary life in Afghanistan. Also read Joydeeps 'The Watch' and 'An Afghan Winter'."
5,A good deal to enjoy,"Though Beethoven could play the violin he was not a virtuoso on the instrument. The piano, on the other hand, was changed as an instrument by him. He was always on a quest for more sonorous and richer sounds and piano makers did their best to oblige. Many of Beethoven's avant guarde ideas about composition and the role of music in self expression started as piano sonatas and piano works. With this in mind, Beethovens compositions for the piano are some of the most outstanding, brilliant, and technically pure works to emerge from any composer. It is impossible not to feel the emotions Beethoven wishes to convey from piece to piece.The piano sonatas are really self contained dramas. In them, you will hear the expressions of sadness, beauty, rage, and unbounded joy. It is impossible to listen to this collection and not find pleasure in it. The recordings as well as the performers are top-notch. Highly recommended."
1,"Book Cover, ""Closer.........Academy""","I may not be the first person to bring this matter about Mr. Alfred W. McCoy's book, particularly about the book cover. I do not know how authoritative he is about Philippine setting, but the display of the Philippine Flag on the book cover is WRONG. I have not read the book because I just chance upon it when I was browsing for another book. I hope this matter will be brought to the author's attention and that of the publisher as well. Joey G....."
5,Classic,This is very good lp if you are a fan of west coast hip hop. You should and need to add this to your collection.
4,"Great movie, a bit slower than I remembered","Fabulous scenary and a near perfect baseball movie. Beginning was a bit slower than I remember. We had to see the past (19 years old), getting in to the club (NY Knights), and then the rise and fall of ""Bump"" Bailey before we could see some great moments from Roy Hobbs.A definite must for ones collection."
2,Read the book,"The book was one of the best sports novels I've ever read, the movie pales in comparison. Bernard Malmud deserves the recognition for this great story, not Redford. If you've already seen the movie, don't spoil it for your kids, get them to read the book first."
3,Born to be Continued?,"I am glad that I got this out of the library, I would have given this a higher rating except there were too many loose ends for me - I got to the end of the book and was surprised that it was over - the two mysteries were wrapped up too neatly and all of the family and friends were introduced but kind of left lying there.When I started reading I expected this to be Mary Lisa's story but also perhaps a prelude to stories for Lou Lou and Elizabeth or even Kelly and Monica. To me it just seems like we had all this info on the secondary characters and they didn't finish or follow up with it."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"When I saw that this deck was coming out (that was in January) I couldn't wait till spring to get it. When it finally arrived, I was terribly disappointed. The usual Little White Book (LWB) that comes with most decks should be called the Little White Pamphlet for this deck. The print is so incredibly tiny that I had to take it work and enlarge it on a copier just to read it (and I have very good vision). It is written in 4 different languages and offers one sample and very basic reading. The rest is up to you. The descriptions of the cards are very simplistic, and although the cards themselves are attractive, I'm sure there is more to their meaning than what is described. I guess I'll just have to wait and see if someone decides to publish a book to go with this deck or put one together of my own interpretations. Overall, disappointed with this one. I'd stick with The Well Worn Path or The Wiccan Pack by Sally Morningstar."
3,emotions,"My personal taste, the first album was better. With this one, I find myself using the track forward button a lot, Though there are songs that I enjoy on it."
4,The Mariah Carey of old,"The songs on this album are all pretty good, especially for ""Can't Let Go"", ""And You Don't Remember"" and ""Emotions"". The voice goes a little too high at times, but it is still a really good album."
1,DOESN'T WORK,"I just received this today. It doesn't work. Neither bulb. Checked batteries, they are fine.I needed this light for a special project and am now very frustrated. I will just buy one of those dollar store things and modify it. I'll be back to let you know about how the return went. Rate light 0 stars.Amazon took care of the return in an instant. Kudos to Amazon.com. Amazon.com gets 5 Stars for their prompt and seamless customer service for this item."
1,Didn't work.... TWICE!!,"Just received it, thought it looked like good quality. Saw it was made in the USA and was even impressed that it had Duracell batteries instead of some no name cheap ones. I put the batteries in ..... and ...... nothing. Swapped out for the red bulb ..... nothing. Tried different AAA batteries ..... nothing. I am returning this faulty one and a new one is supposedly on the way from Amazon. Will update if the 2nd try is better.2nd Try: failure... I received the 2nd unit quickly (Amazon return process is quite easy). However, this unit did not work either. Incredibly disappointed."
3,Peacemaking,"This book was recommended to me for its treatment of the peacekeeping principles of the Haudenosaunee, however there wasn't much detail or depth to it's coverage of these principles. By and large, this book relates the story of the Iroquois confederacy's 1977 trip to the United Nations and their struggle for recognition as a sovereign nation. For those of you interested in peacemaking principles, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Little replay value,"This is a 2D side scroller that's easy to beat, hence little replay value. Basically you use tricks to outclass your rivals. Rent it if you must try it."
1,Be careful.. Refill card will not work.. Amazon sucks...,My refill card did not work. I called T-Mobile and they said the refill card did not released properly and asked me to call Amazon. Amazon asked me to return the card. The complete round time 4 weeks until then your money stuck with Amazon. It is really frustrating. Amazon sucks....
1,T-Moblie is awful,"T-Mobile has the worst customer service ever. They do not stand behind their products and with pre paid cards they already have your money so what do they care about your service. I went with them because of the 100 minutes that were good for a year, now I'm sitting here with a phone that doesn't work and a 1 year warrenty that they won't honner."
5,best deal on prepaid cell phones,Switched over from tracphone. Been very happy with both the new phone and 1000 minutes for $100.
2,Good Potential ...,"... but room for improvement.I received Priscilla Royal's Wine of Violence as a free eBook download, so I should not complain too much.I am always interested in Medieval history, but this book let me down. It could have been set during any random time in the past. The characters seemed rather one-dimensional and stereotypical, almost cliched, with dialogue occasionally jarring. The mystery, was marginally intriguing, but the deductions and final conclusion left me flat.Comparisons were made to Ellis Peters, maybe I need to read her Brother Cadfael books.Would I read more of Priscilla's books? meh ..."
4,Wine of Violence,Wonderful book. If you like medieval mystery you will like Priscilla Royal. She seems to get better with each book.
3,Interesting historical bits,"This isn't the best written book on medieval religious orders, but it has some good parts. I probably wouldn't recommend it to ALL my friends, but some would find it interesting."
4,Interesting concept,"Very well plotted/written historical mystery, well rounded characters that for the most part seemed to fit into the era.The murders the plot revolved around were seemingly of less importance than the focus of other events, although the cooperation between the young and astute prioress of the abbey and the civilian ""coroner"" was interesting and different.In many ways the author seemed to be drawing some links between misconduct within the religious community in that era with some of the misconduct seen within the Catholic Church today. Somewhat of a modern and more cynical interpretation of the religious communities several centuries in the past and probably more accurate as well. I'm not normally a fan of mysteries set well back in time and specifically with religious characters, but this one worked well for me, probably because of the more modern presentation of the religious community lifestyles."
3,Not for a heat pump with back up electric or gas,This is a basic thermostat to run a simple system. It runs on a battery instead of the system voltage. It will not control a heat pump with electric or gas back up. I would suggest moving up to a better model.
2,replacement,"Up and down buttons only work for a couple of years, and uses too many batteries. One will need to replace it as it is not a long term item."
5,Go-to cookbook,"My boyfriend and I sit down for a meal and it goes something like this:Bf: Wow! This is really good. Where did you get the recipe?Me: From the cookbook my coworker gave me in the book exchange. You know the one.Bf: (mouth full of food) Mmm hmm, yum.Another winner from The Complete Vegan Cookbook.This is my go-to cookbook. I make the fast and delicious recipes in this book more than any other recipes. I love the pasta puttanesca with artichokes, the potato and garlic soup, rice noodles with curried veggies, tempeh rancheros, chorizo ""sausage"", linguine with asparagus, walnuts and fresh herbs. This book has my favorite hummus recipe. When I made the chocolate-cinnamon walnut cake, a non-vegan friend asked for the recipe and made it for her non-vegan husband's birthday that week!I also appreciate a little bit of history, accompaniment suggestions, leftover storing and alternative ingredients in the side bars."
1,RUN from this book!,"I do not believe in banning books but if I did, this would be the one I would ban. I read this book as a teenager and have been since recovering from the ignorant guilt that it instills. My mother had me read it to learn about sex. It doesn't teach so much about sex as it teaches one to feel guilty about his or her body. It teaches abstinence from not only premarital sex but also from masturbation and even ""impure"" thoughts. As a Christian, I believe that God has given us a great gift in sex and that we need to be responsible but not let guilt drive our actions. As a physician, I recommend a more factual book for sex education. I certainly have for my own daughter."
5,Impressive wax from Meguiar's,I have been using Ziano Brothers car products for years but decided to try something different and based on what I read I ended up ordering Meguiar's Yellow Wax #26. I gave up on natural Carnauba waxes years ago because I found most to be messy in terms of wipe up (dust/chalk). So for the longest time I only used synthetic waxes which go one easy and wipe off easy. Meguiar's Yellow Wax #26 is made from both Carnauba and synthetic stuff like silicones and polymers so I was not sure what to expect. I was happily surprised with the results both applying the wax and the brilliant shine/protection it provides. This wax is thicker than synthetic based wax but it's fairly easy to lay down and wipe up is not bad either but still not as easy as synthetic waxes like what Ziano Brothers and other's offer. Now the only question is durability and how long with the wax last compared to what I am use to. Time will tell but in the meanwhile I think i have a new favorite wax!
4,it gets better as you go,"Great book, it starts out a little slow and can be difficult to read but once you get the hang of it it's not that bad. You also start understanding the characters and you get really into it, it keeps you guessing as you get little bits from each character and you have to put it all together, a great read!"
3,Pretty decent,The book is difficult to follow but adequately projects a type of human countrified suffering of long ago that is spell-binding.
3,"A complicated, but vivid book.","I read this book for school (I had to chose a few american writers). I found this book to be a little hard to follow. It's very detailed and I like the humor that pops up every now and then, but as for the plot I'm not really sure if there was one. I read that Faulkner wrote this in 6 weeks. if you have to do a report on this book I'd reccomend taking notes along the way..."
3,Faulkner uglified,"Faulkner strikes again in that in this one, the method of narration seems revolutionary and incredible. Once again he teaches me that a writer can switch times, characters and other elements and still tell the same story. The plot, aside from that, is fairly simple. But, given the enormously talented writer, this book just seemed ugly to me - ugly in the sense that the words seemed to be in sepia tones - leave it to Faulkner, he's good enough to plan it that way -. The idea of flies on the mother's body, and of Darl's thoughts, and of the poverty of the family and the seeming desperation of it all (it reminded me of ""Lonesome Dove""'s Woodrow Call painstakingly trying to bring Gus McCrae's body back to Texas) I just felt yucky the whole time I was reading it."
3,Dark but poetic,"My book club just finished reading and discussing ""As I Lay Dying."" All of us used Cliff notes to one extent or another to make our way through it. Most of us found it rather dreary, some disturbingly so. A loud cry was, ""I didn't like a single character!"" But at the same time, we all appreciated certain passages and Faulkner's poetic imagery.One member pointed out that to fully appreciate it, this book should be read aloud. We agreed also that one would benefit by reading it more than once. The first read, for most people, will simply be getting a handle on the characters and storyline, as well as the shifting thereof. But once that is under your belt, the second read, aloud, would be a more liberating and rewarding experience. I plan to get a hold of it on tape and ""read"" it that way for my second time around. Bleak as the lives it portrays, it is equally masterful and moving in its poetic descriptions."
2,Great Book!,"I'm not going to say that As I Lay Dying is a bad novel, surely it can't be since it ranks as one of the best novels of the 20th century. I will say that maybe it isn't for me. After about 70 pages into it, I was wondering if this is a book that would be memorable to me and wondering if it was worth it to keep reading.But i finished it and i thought it was quite a good book."
1,Faulkner's Practical Joke,"I don't like this book. I am not going to provide a lengthy explanation, because all of you who rated this 5 stars will just condemn me as a moron, and all of you who don't like this book will only agree with what I have to say.I agreed with most of the one and two star ratings (beyond the argument that it was ""confusing""), and did not feel obligated to write a review other than to hopefully lower the overall rating of this novel."
4,"Kind of a trip, good intro to Faulkner","Somehow I missed the section in American Lit where we read Faulkner, so 20 years later, here we go. This was a solid intro to Faulkner's style; he is a very cryptic author who does an excellent job of creating characters and narrative without a ton of direct description. Readers will vacillate between respecting members of the Bundren family and hating others at times, as do the other characters who interact with them. And, oddly enough, one of the biggest plot points gets about four words. If you skipped this one, it's a strong read."
5,grim masterpiece of characters,"The different chapters penned by the strong characters of the novel works to bring their personalities to life in this rich story about a rural family burying one of their own, and getting on with their lives.... one of my favorite books!"
1,Mr Mike's Misfired Program,"I did see this as a theater release many years ago. It was in intended to have been a ""Saturday Night Live"" kind of special, but the NBC Network wouldn't run it.. So with some hype, it was released in theaters and it tanked.It is an assembled collage of staged and public domain clips, arranged in no particular order and not making much sense. Its funny value was lost on me, if indeed there was anything intended with that.By the end of the 70 minutes, I felt my time had been wasted, and had a strong urge to request my money back."
