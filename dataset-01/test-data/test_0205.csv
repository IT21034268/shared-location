5,Best for Sore Nipples from Breastfeeding,"My mom always used this when she was breastfeeding when she got sore nipples. We brought it over from Switzerland (CH) whenever we run out, I'm so happy to see it on amazon. Americans just have no clue about good healing creams. This stuff is fantastic for sore nipples from breastfeeding. I am about to have my dad bring home a bunch if it's way cheaper in CH. But I'd buy it for $10 too if I couldn't get it. It lasts us YEARS. The tube I have, I use sparingly, only for sore nipples, and I have been using the same tube..for 3 babies. It's definitely worth your ten bucks. No clue why America doesn't catch on...I never like lanolin - that sticky stuff, I only use that to lanolize wool diaper covers."
2,RIDICULOUS SHIPPING CHARGES- Did not combine,"Great Plates, but the seller did not combine shipping charges on multiple items sent in a single box"
3,"A gritty, speculative solution to the kidnapping","I've never read anything by this author before now, so it may be his style, but I was distracted by all the sexual descriptions. It got pretty predictable after a while. Just about everybody but the Lindberghs is depicted this way. I've been interested in the Lindbergh case since 1971. Before she died, I was able to visit Anna Hauptmann in her home. What a delightful lady! I don't claim to have all the answers to this mystery, but I appreciate reading serious scholarship as well as a novel like Coburn's. I still think ""Scapegoat"" by Anthony Scaduto is brilliant. I could read it again!"
2,Not so Sunsational...,"I purchased this awning two years ago for a west-facing window on my Phoenix home. The awning gets full afternoon sun. The material itself has held up remarkably well, with less fading than I expected. The problem is the stitching that holds the whole thing together. After two years, the cotton stitching on most of the seams has rotted away. One result is that the outer metal frame has separated from the material. Needless to say, the awning is shot. Sure, you can get replacement material, but that costs nearly as much as what I paid for the awning. Seems they would spend a little more on stitching that lasts as long as the awning material. Definitely disappointed in this product, especially considering the manufacturer's claim that the product lasts up to 15 years. Not true."
2,The translation is not good,"I understand it might be a popular translation, but this translation just screams awkward. I mean, ""spinach green""? ""Hell is JUST other people""? The kicker - Estelle DELAUNAY and VINCENT GRADEAU???"
2,Strange kind of album,"1 star or 2? was the relevant question about that double cd album. Althouh Steven Morse does fine (enough of making saint of Ritchie Blackmore. The man was tired and did nothing useful in his last albums with the band), the album dissapoints. I have solo albums (vinyl) of Lord, Glover and Gillan from the 70s, and they are much better. Actually, the first cd should be taken directly to the trash can. The 2nd is much better, cause it brings us the real Purple. As for the concerto - the years haven't done good with it. What was an achievement for the young Jon Lord in 1970, is far from satisfy our expectations from the older Lord in 2000. Even in the late 70s he made better works. At least, the recording is excellent, unlike the original from 30 years ago. The rest of the 2nd cd is fine, and that's the reason for the 2nd star."
2,Item is not item that is pictured (NOT USB!!),"I have been searching for this keyboard for a decent price for a while... It is the one I use at work and it is super soft to the touch making keying extremely easy. I use a LOT of different types of keyboards in my line of work so I say with confidence that this keyboard has the least amount of discomfort as far as keying and although I type maybe 75% of my day, I've only once in the past few years of keyboarding use have had some wrist strain (which eventually went away). The best of the best in basic keyboards.Now, the reason for the low rating is because for a USB version of this keyboard (as pictured), it is an amazing price. But! That is not what I received. I received a PS/2 keyboard which rendered it useless since I needed it for my laptop. I kept it anyways as a backup (you can easily purchase a PS/2-USB adapter for $2). If I had known it wouldn't be the item pictured, I could have saved maybe $5-$10 by buying it on eBay."
4,So-So,I liked this book well enough. I think Sunny was truly unfair to her mom. I would have stuck right by my moms side. I can see why Dawn got mad at Sunny. She is incredibly selfish and VERY boy-crazy. I liked the other California Diaries a lot better. Thats why i gave it 4 stars. P.S. Maggie is my favorite character.
4,Eff'n brilliant of course,"Those who believe they see the Mind of God in FB's endlessly creative chord and time changes, as well as his genius with rhyming patterns, will listen to this album the first few times and be disappointed. I confess I was a little. DO NOT GIVE UP! He trades in some musical inventiveness for more traditional blues, country, and folk progressions, but Frank devours them, inhabits them, becomes them, and the result is some of his most soul-satisfying songs ever. No joke. His lyrical and rhymic mastery has never been better. Wouldv'e been 5 stars except for one dog on the album (The Snake)."
2,Teenager was brilliant,Just because you start doing Neil Young inspired music doesn't make it mature or creative. I too miss Speedy Marie. Maybe I'm just old.
4,Works as described,"I put the sensor in my basement and the receiver in my living room and it works fine (I was afraid the range would be too small). Wish the warning beeps were a bit louder, but since I can place the receiver anywhere in the house, not an issue. Great piece of mind for the money - I don't have to constantly run down to the basement to check if the sump needs to be run.PROS:- It's wireless, so you can have the alert box where you need it- You can monitor additional areas by adding sensors, including ones to monitor if your garage is open- the white alert box is pretty small - seemed bigger in the picture- Does not feel flimsyCONS:- The warning beeps could've been a bit louder, but since I can put it anywhere in the house, not a big issue."
4,Works for me!,"I haven't got water in my basement yet, but I tested it by placing it in water in my basement. I have it on my first floor and it worked great."
1,Self-Serving,"Rather than attempt to justify his failed presidency or the highly questionable acts he committed as head of the CIA, Bush tries to salvage his historical reputation by publishing a series of warm family letters. While this book will have use to future historians because it illustrates Bush's current desperation to go down in history as some sort of statesman, it does nothing to show the underhanded type of businessman and politician he was. George Bush the family man should not be confused with George Bush the career politician. That type of confusion is what he tries to pull off here, and readers should be aware of it."
4,An interesting insight...,"This book lends an interesting insight into the mind and world of George Bush. Recently I have become interested in the goings on of 80's politics, and have found that Bush plays a key role in much of this. This book offers great insight into the motivations behind Bush's actions and thought process. It also offers a peek at the personal George Bush, something many of us do not get to see of our leaders.I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone who is interested in Bush, American politics or American conservative thought.Of course, this book begs the question: ""What did he decide to leave out of the book?"""
2,Don't waste your time,The first third of the book was good and fast paced but as you keep reading the book gets dull and boring. I really don't know why I finished it. Maybe 20 years ago it was a blockbuster but I don't think it is now.
2,This is a fluff,"I have always looked forward to Iris Johansen's books but was disappointed in this one - she usually writes a good mystery/romance with some depth to the story but this was a lot of fluff! Sorry - you can do better, Iris. Too much money for a little story! I would not buy it."
2,THE BOOK THE UNIVERSE SHOULD READ!,"i own hacker and pig-heart boy and i would recomend it to anyoon! all my family enjoyed it and you will too! it is about a girl called vicky that is hacking into a the bank computer to help save her dad - he has been accused of stealing over a million pounds from the bank that he works in. this is what the blurb says: WHEN VICKY'S FATHER IS ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF STEALING OVER A MILLION POUNDS FROM THE BANK WHERE HE WORKS, SHE IS DETERMINED TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE. BUT HOW, WHEN ALL THE EVIDENCE IS HIDDNE IN COMPUTER FILES? HELPED BY HER BROTHER GIB AND HIS BEST FRIEND CHAUCY, VICKY DECIDES TO TRY AND HACK INTO THE BANK'S COMPUTERS. FOR IF THERE IS ONE SCHOOL SUBJECT SHE IS REALLY GOOD AT, IT IS COMPUTING. BUT EVEN IF SHE DOES MANAGE TO BREAK INTO THE SYSTEM, CAN SHE FIND ALL THE ANSWERS BEFOR THE REAL THEIEF FINDS HER? you MUST READ this exellent book! Malorie is such a good author!"
3,Good recipes but difficult book layout,"First off, the recipes themselves in Chez Panisse Fruit are great. But the book itself seems more like an art piece than a book that's intended for frequent use in the kitchen.Most importantly, the book is impossible to keep open, even if it's open to the very middle pages. If you want to keep it open while cooking, you'll need to weigh down the pages with another heavy book. Or photocopy the pages for the given recipe, which is a bit silly if you've bought the book.Also, I have perfectly good vision, but I think the print is excessively small compared to the page size. The text only takes up the center 50% of the page, making it difficult to read if you're standing in the kitchen and the book is on the counter.If you're just reading the text from an armchair, I'm sure it's a lovely book as-is. But I don't think it's at all well designed for someone wanting to cook with it."
4,"That's right, he's not just a great guitar player","If most of America hasn't heard of Adrian Belew, they've certainly heard his playing with Paul Simon, David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, Talking Heads, et. al. This CD allows the world to see what a talented singer, songwriter, arranger and producer Adrian Belew is. Hearing the pop mastery of 'Valley Drive' gives one the feeling that Belew could have easily sold himself as a genius popsmith all these years, but he decided to make music for himself as well as us. Witnessed by the iconoclastic performers who have hand picked him through the years (Zappa, Robert Fripp, etc. etc.), we can truly say that he's a true original."
1,Sounds like a dying animal,"...I don't approach this album as a past fan or even as someone vaguelyfamiliar with this guy's work. His voice is horrible, there's notmuch here musically, and the second half of the album has a bunch of indistinguishable tracks. END"
5,Esau Swindle Is A Feast For Your Eyes,"The Esau Swindle, by Gerald Rothberg is a high-energy roller-coaster ride that left me wanting more. This book reeks with intrigue, romance, espionage and murder. Wow. The Esau Swindle brought me into the dark world of art corruption and military coups. The tense ending with the U.S. president's arrival in Argentina topped everything I've read in thrillers. A great read."
1,Swindle is right...,"This author and book are not comparable to DeMille and any of his books. I tossed the book when I finished it. From now on, when I purchase a book based only on reviews, I'll check to see who the publisher is."
3,"Helpful, though a little long","There are some good positive and negative reviews on this book, so I won't go into detail in this one. I have a large gap in my education that has to do with anything mathematical, so very basic books like this are very helpful for me. The author explains some very key concepts in statistics and does a good job in explaining how to interpet or reframe information based on statistical data. For that the book deserves high marks. On the other hand, it was a bit long and unfocused and should have been pared down a bit. All in all, though, I do recommend the book if your knowledge of the topic is not at a very advanced level."
5,Kids love him,"One of the best ""stuffies"" for a kid to carry around and play with. Great gift for that special occasion."
5,Fun and inspiring adventure-laden book to read,"This was a very cool and exciting book to read. I have never read any of Jenkins's columns but I was intrigued by the premise of the book when listening to him on a radio interview. Jenkins sounds like the guy I want to be, but without the guts. He attacks life....he attacks nature, but he's turned his sojourns all over the world into a sort of an art form.The book is a collection of adventures and I like the fact that he threw in other different stories in there including an encounter with a thief and parallel storytelling over a number of years.I realized that it wasn't actually the adventures I enjoyed, but rather the memories and experiences he had while undertaking these adventures. Just like the cliche: ""It's not about the destination, but about the journey.""The pace of the book is good and it does not get repetitive so please check this one out."
3,Dont Expect Vendetta Red,"The main problem with Sirens Sister is they never live up to the glorius work we got from most of the members when they called themselves Vendetta Red, and for those who loved the sound Vendetta Red created this is a major letdown. The main problem is it seems someone told Zach to calm down on the complicated and intense lyrics, and to try and write more ""classic"" rock tunes. What we get is some stifled lyrics, some retread lyrics, and some truly awful lyrics. We also get Zach never singing full force, he never gets to the emotional agonized pitch we remember. There are a couple close calls on some songs but overall this is Vendetta Red with a censor/editor/corporate influence."
4,Softer colors,"The egg itself is about 5 inches, the base is two inches. The inside is a pastoral scene, with a church and buildings stating on a grassy lawn. There is a fence going across the front of the scene, to complete the setting. The trees and skies are layered to continue the 3-d setting of this cute little diorama in an egg.The purple and pink ""traditional Jim Shore"" pattern is a quilt like pattern, and the color theme is carried into the roses which circle the base.While this is a very pretty piece, I enjoy the bolder colors of Jim Shore, and these pastels are quite a different feel from my other Jim Shore pieces."
5,attention!,I have had this album since college in the 80's. Nothing brings back my memories of growing up in Europe like this one. I just found this cd and am so excited!
1,Ugh,"This book should be put in the fantasy section of any bookstore.I get terribly tired of the tales of Ueyeshiba's supernatural exploits. And sadly this book is replete with such nonsense. Seriously they should put this next to exploits of Drizzt Do'Urden or The Hulk.A more interesting book would have chronicled the development of O'Sensei's early ideas on martial arts with his later crazy views. They are quite different, and moreover it is a progression you can see in the old photographs of him at work. Specifically, you see the journey he took from more or less practical aiki-jutsu to the flowery, ineffectual sillyness he wasted the latter years of his life on."
1,Disappointed in quality of book-not the recipes,"I have no problem with the cookbook, the recipes are some of the best. I actually made this purchase to replace an old original copy that is falling apart. So why was I disappointed? The book I purchased was a photocopy of the original recipe book. The pages were crooked, and some of the vital information such as recipe quantities and instructions were cut-off by bad copying. My Mother also purchased a copy and it was in the same condition. I will keep the book and make the correction, since I have an old copy. However, I will never purchase another book from the vendor who sold me the book."
1,Didn't work on my laptop,I never actually got this working on my Gateway Laptop. Followed the instructions and looked for help online but didn't end up getting it to work
3,Pantera Live CD,"The CD has a very good list of songs from Pantera's repertoire. However the recording quality leaves something to be desired. I've purchased live albums from other bands that sounded almost as good as the original recordings. I've only listened to the CD in my car stereo, but had to do adjustments on the Bass, Treble and Mid-range to get a decent sound."
5,page-turner,"Bawdy and philosophical in equal proportions, a gripping and fulfilling book. If you're like me, you'll find it's one you won't want to put down."
5,A great read,"This is writing at its best. Dexter deals with the time, place and people in a most convincing way. Great characters and a splendid piece of story telling."
5,A good read,"I like reading books on subjects I know little about.When interested in economics, I was referred to the this book several times.I hesitated at first due to the price, but decided to go with it due to recommendations (something I rarely gamble on)I was very pleased. Well written, and easy to read. Just what I was looking for. I really want to see how Varoufakis would tackle companions for other subjects beyond economics."
4,Worth buying just for track 15,"David Byrne continues to compose music of unearthly beauty. Unsuprisingly the best tracks are the ones he sings on.If you liked ""The Forest"" you will like track 14. The album is worth buying just for track 15. Haunting. One of those tracks where, for a brief moment in time, your life stands still. Thank you David Byrne."
2,Another soundtrack.,"If you like David Byrne's soundtracks (which I do not), then ""Lead Us Not Into Temptation"" is for you. I am reminded of buying ""The Forest"" and all the disappointment that came with it. In my not so humble opinion, David should stick with his eccentric, eclectic brand of alternative music. That is where he excels. ""Lead Us Not Into Temptation"" is just an exercise in unmemorable and almost unlistenable soundtrack music. As it is an okay cd and performed by Byrne, I give it two stars, but buyers beware!"
4,Not Quite Perfect!,"I would have to agree with what the previous customer reviewer has experienced with this coffeemaker. I find the timer a little feature that makes morning coffee preparation so much easier. We have had trouble with pouring coffee from the carafe, too. If the coffee is poured slowly, there is little or no problem. Everytime someone unfamiliar with the coffee pot pours a cup of coffee, they end up embarrassed by a large spill on the counter. Also, we have only had this coffee maker since 2/99, and my timer has already broken, just with normal, everyday use. I will admit being rather disappointed by that."
4,Excellent Suspense,"Ruth Rendell is my favorite novelist and any time I hear a writer compared to her I am skeptical. But this book is the closest I have read in a very long time. Like Rendell's psychological suspense this book draws you slowly in to what at first appears to be a ""normal"" schoolgirl world but is really something else. If you are a fan of Rendell you will probably like Ms. Evans. I am looking forward to reading her other work."
5,Spectacular book,"This is one of the best art books I have ever purchased. The layout and reproductions are beautiful: high quality paper, etc. The text, particularly a lengthy article about the Bruges artistic culture of the time, is very informative. Can't go wrong with this one."
2,Not standard size,"I purchased this matress at BRU today and am disappointed that I'll have to return it. It is about an inch shorter than the Sealy mattress my son is now using in his toddler bed. So, I definitely know it will not fit snugly in our old crib. Be wary that this mattress is not of standard crib size, it measures a little over 51 inches."
4,It's not what you know but who you know.,"This is a story of a basically unexeptional young man who climbs to the top of Parisien society by demonstrating the truth of ""it's not what you now but who you know"". Specifically he uses his attractiveness to women to seduce the wives of colleagues and aquaintances and through them to influence their husbands. George Duroy has an inflated idea of his abilities and a sense that he is entitled to wealth and power, not through talent and hard work, but because it is due to him. I think we all know of people who use their attractiveness to manipulate those around them. George is an extreme case, and unlike most stories bad behaviour does not lead to his downfall and he does not get his comeuppance, which is what makes this such a good read. The only relationship that i felt did not ring true was George's seduction of Mme. Walter, which is why I didn't give 5 stars."
1,rien ne se traduit! il faut apprendre le franais,"je ne peux pas comprendre les gens qui lisent la littérature franaise en anglais. d'abord, rien ne se traduit (tradurre e' tradire). deuxièmement, en lisant, par exemple, ""Fauxpassant"" vous devenez l'esclave totale du traducteur. ce que vous lisez correspondre non pas à ce qu'a écrit Maupassant, mais aux idées plates d'un traducteur qui ne sait mme pas comment écrire! (c'est pour cela, n'est-ce pas, qu'il travaille comme traducteur...)"
4,"Very Good, But Doesn't Quite Attain Excellence","I enjoyed this book very much and readily recognize that it is head and shoulders above so much contemporary fiction -- particularly all this Oprah Winfrey-approved garbage. Nevertheless, ""Bel-Ami"" is overly long and almost surreal in its redundancy -- it loops in on itself time and time again, rather like the whorls on a snail's shell that travel far but ultimately never really go or lead anywhere.Don't misunderstand -- this is a fine book, well worth reading (the pretentious introduction isn't worthy of it, by the way). Maupassant was, however, a short story writer (one of the finest, actually), and I strongly suspect that ""Bel-Ami"" would have worked far more effectively as a story rather than as a novel.By the way, the movie version, with George Sanders ideally cast in the lead role, is well worth viewing."
5,Beautiful,I bought this item for Feng Shui purposes. It is very heavy and a wonderful color. I would purchase this item again.
3,SSHSAT Book review,"There are a few prep books in the market, I woul rate them as below1. Barron's How to prepare for SSHSAT ----4 stars2. Kaplan's SCI-Hi------------------------3 stars3. Princeton Preview SSHSAT---------------3 stars4. Arco Specialized science High exam-----2 stars"
3,The description of this book is inaccurate,This book does not include practice tests for the Hunter College High School exam (as Amazon's description indicates).
1,Get this if you're too young to rent a porn,"I'm no prude. I love sex in movies, toilet humor, farting; the whole shebang. I loved the first AP, the second was good too. The third, not bad. But this! This is nothing but 90 minutes of soft porn, orgasms flying through the air, bestiality and just about anything else you can think of.All the sex, in and of itself, save for the bestiality, is fine. But if I was in the mood to watch that, I would have rented a porn. Why it ended up in an AP movie is beyond me.Is the writer and director so lame, that all they could do was throw sex scene after sex scene in it????The soul of American Pie was annihilated in this garbage film. No wonder the original cast won't have anything to do with it. It would ruin their careers."
3,Good interface but not for Mac Book Pro,"It is good for record, good for your speakers, but until today, I have not make it work fine with my Mac Book Pro. It has a well-known issue with ground-loops and has a hum. On the m-audio site all the solutions are obvious and not working, at least for me..."
4,Fun relatively drama-free episode,"If you like watching this show for a glimpse at how the other half lives, then you may like this one. There wasn't really any fighting or arguing, which actually is a nice change of pace. I like watching the show to see the glitz and glamour. Adrienne ends up hosting a shoe fashion show at her home. The ladies come over and it's a beautiful event. When I watch things like this, I wonder how these ladies got to be where they are in life. I think it can be something to aspire to or dream about."
4,Why choose this album?,"To answer that question in the title would depend on how the album will be used. My girlfriend wants to use ""Butterfly Kisses"" at our wedding. And as I've never heard of this song before as I'm in Europe (no excuse of course) I listened to a sample and I was immediately convinced that this is perfect for our wedding reception dance.It is of course excellent for lovers everywhere in the world."
2,Too small,"I surprised myself when i received it. It is really small, about 4 inches. It is complicated to find the correct focus, and you cannot write down the actual zoom."
3,Is what it is...,"Well, it works. And the light on it is pretty descent. My main problem with it is the difficulty to turn the knobs for focus and zoom. You really gotta push, making it difficult to lock on to something while focusing. This results in constant re positioning and ultimately frustrtion. If your just using it casually to look at random things up close, I say go for it."
1,Carson Lighted Pocket Microscope,"I was looking for something that I could read the fine print engraved on jewelry. I was disappointed withthis product ~ it is hard to adjust and ""some"" print on paper is about all I have been able to see closeup.This product will adorn my trashcan."
1,Tiny,Buyer beware...this thing is about 2 inches big. It is so small and haven't been able to see a darn thing with it.
1,Doesn't Work For What I Needed It For!,I should have listened to the reviewer who wanted it for looking at the edges of straight razor as this is what I wanted it for!! Wrong tool for the job!! It's now money down the drain!
2,product was to small to do anything with,did not like to small of a lens it needs to be larger overall to see anything very sensitive on adjustments
2,Pretty Useless,"The major issue is the LED is so bright everything looks bright white. you really can't make out much detail. The object you are viewing has to be perfectly flat against the base or you cannot focus in on it, even then it is hard to align you eye on the eypiece to see anything."
3,It is what it is,Maybe its my eyes but I have a hard time seeing anything clearly for more then a second then it will float away. Also most people who need glasses may find viewing difficult because you need to take your glasses off to view. I have severe astigmatism and floaters in my eye are very bothering when trying to view. I can understand why it is considered a good value and fun to use but i'm looking for high quality resolution and would be happy to pay more. I just haven't found it yet. any ideas?
3,Low quality optics,"This little microscope is cheap but so is the quality. I am not sure if the lenses are plastic or not, but the quality is not very good."
3,Good but limited field of view,"Not bad and for the price great.I'm a casulty surveyor and this lives in my pocket and great for looking at crack / fracture sites and other items.The field of view is quite limited, however, I also carry a loup and between them I have just what I want.."
5,it works,What more can i say? The thing works like it is suppose to and for the price it is not bad at all.
2,too tedious,"magnification is fine, but controlling this tiny little thing is a hassle. fine for a child toy but no good to you if you need quality over cost."
1,"A very, very bad product","A very, very bad productBurned money, better than buying this scrap,this product is its place in the garbage"
1,Could not get clear image,"Just Like a read from others, the image is fuzzy. The seller sent another unit back to me focused. Still fuzzy. Had a friend look and he said it was fuzzy for him, too. I wanted a focus like they show in the advertisement. Don't waste your money, because the seller of this product knows it is not good. Charge almost $7.00 to ship an item that cost $1.20 and then will not give your full money back including any shipping cost."
3,It really is small,This microscope really is small. It fits in the palm of my hand. The knobs were not so difficult to use as other reviews suggest. I couldn't get it to work at first. Then my son figured out you have to put it right up against the item you are looking at it. We bought it as a replacement for another we purchased for my 7 year old son for Christmas. The first one didn't work so I purchased this one. We got it on time and packaged very well. It worked out of the box after he figured out the part about putting the microscope right up against the item. He's having fun with it. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for that reason. If he's outside he has to be on his knees leaning down to look at something and I wish I could find one that allowed him to be a bit further away. I suppose its to be expected since it is a pocket microscope. Can't wait until after the snow melts and the mud dries up. My son will hours of fun with this.
1,Technically does what it is advertised,"So this handheld microscope is about 1/2'' wide by 2'' long. It has a tiny viewing area, and operation is almost impossible when not on a tabletop. Just a step up from useless... really dissapointed."
3,"Allright for the money, difficult to use.","It really is tiny. The eyepiece cup is the size of a dime, and the lens inside it even smaller.An exercise in frustration to use. I could not keep it on the item of interest, the very slightest motion and the item is lost, out of view.Not bad if you are patient and determined.I need something a little better and more expensive."
3,Carson MM-200 Carson Micromax LED 60X-100X LED Lighted Pocket..,"This was no exactly what I expected. It will work, but I was a little disappointed in the functionality. This is one item that's hard to buy online since you cant hold it and test it before purchasing."
3,Subject has to be very close or touching microscope to see.,"You have to look pretty hard to find what you're looking for with this microscope because of the high zoom. It also has to be right under and touching the microscope otherwise you can't see it. It's good if you're looking for something to look at small things on a table, this might be good. If you want to look at something at quick glance about 0 to 6"" away, then there are better options I found after buying this."
1,"absolute junk, don't waste your money","Can't see anything at all with it. Looks like lens inside is dirtied with something like maybe glue. Like I said, we can't see anything at all with it."
2,"Small field of view, inverts image","It has a small field of view, and it inverts the image you're looking at. Should be called ""Toy Microscope""."
3,Scope,Hard to get this little scope to focus but once in focus has a good view lets you see what lets you know every detail of crop
2,No answers!,"I was trying to learn this subject on my own because the school I attend does not offer a course on power. I got through the first chapter and tried to solve some problems on my own, but got no where because there are no answers in the back of the book for any of the problems. I guess there are some solutions manual, but since the book was not published recently (1994) all of the resources for it seem to be depreciated. From the looks of the book (so far) it seems like a really great resource, but not good to teach yourself out of."
2,"Not Aircast, Not Beige","I've owned the Aircast band pictured before. This came without indication of the Aircast brand, and it came in black. I suspect it's a knockoff and not as high quality. Not worth the headache to return. Will just avoid this vendor, ShopMedicalSupply, in the future. First bad experience with Amazon."
3,Aircast,I have used the aircast for over a month. Not sure if it has made a difference with tendonitis. The aircast is esay to use.
5,Excellent product,My physical therapist recommended it and i had twice the pain relief and more strength when i use it for relief of my tennis elbow. Im only 46 never thought i could have suck pain from using my computer mouse too much!

5,Rubber maid products,"Absolutely wonderful! Can easily see what is in the containers, microwaveable, dishwasher safe! Awesome."
5,Nice,These containers have a very nice design. Great value! They were shipped quickly and I am very happy with the quality.
4,Nice product!,"Pros:-it's Rubbermaid, so it's good-lids snap on very easily-many different storage capacities-don't stainCons:-I wish they provided more large containers-spotting issues from dishwasher (but that could be my dishwasher)Overall, still a worthwhile purchase!"
4,Good all around food storage container set,This set has the perfect sizes.Easily washable in top rack of dishwasher.Lids fit well.Nothing to complain about. These serve well.
5,Excellent hornbook,"If you're a One-L looking for a study aid for your Contracts class, you won't find a better hornbook than this one. Calamari's classic text provides clear and intelligible discussion of the basic principles of contract law.Also consider the student edition of E. Allan Farnsworth's treatise on Contracts; the original was three volumes long, but the student edition is condensed to one. Farnsworth's discussion is more in-depth, wide-ranging, and denser than Calamari's, so I used Calamari to get principles clear and then turned to Farnsworth for elaboration.Get both if you can; otherwise get this one first. That's my recommendation, anyway."
4,Best Hornbook I Own,"And I own far too many, especially for someone who actually spends time writing Amazon reviews.This book does a great job of explaining the policy and history-succinctly-behind most of the rules and theories we've covered in class and in the casebook.I think this is my favorite hornbook, but I give it four stars for not giving as much insight into specific cases as other hornbooks do."
3,Tripod dolly,After reading other reviews I agree the wheels are a little noisy on hard surfaces. After a few drops of oil on wheel bearings it rolls very smoothly. It is light weight and does what its suppose to do. In fully extended position it is a very stable unit even at high tripod settings. Other then the slightly noisy wheels it serves its purpose.The noise is noticeable only in a quiet setting.Do not expect it to move smoothly on surfaces that are rough or material as carpets. The product was shipped and received in excellent time.
1,photo Impact Pro 11 very bad!!!,First of all I could not get this program to install on my computer. Tech. support is non existent. I tried all the things listed on the web site and only succeeded in crashing my computer. I spent hours getting it back in order. I am returning it for a refund.
2,What A Disappointment,"This software is the most frustrating tool I've EVER used. It is not at all intuitive. When doing fine work with Bezier, it will just decide to close my area or drop it off completely as if I never started. The magic wand is only as good as your color differences are extreme, no matter what. If you have a black haired person against a mottled background, you lose chunks of the head. I've been struggling with this tool for nearly two weeks and have never used so many cuss words in my life. I'm going to dump this and go buy PhotoShop. My blood pressure is worth the difference!"
4,Excellent,"I am a strong fan of Forgotten Realms novels and bought this Ravenloft book by mistake. I am very happy that I made that mistake because this book was great. It got me into Ravenloft and is still the best along with I, Strahd."
2,not great,"This is a typical book for the Dragonlance series. Predictable, boring tripe. This is a book that would be mostly liked by angsty preteens, and definitely not for someone who wants good honest horror/fantasy."
3,A Nice Overview of The Gnostic Gospels,"I thought this book provided readers with a nice clear reading of the Gnostic Gospels and it is a good starting point for people who are not familiar with these books. I would have liked to see more literary analysis of the books inside this collection and did not think the author provided a deep enough study of what the books were and what they represented inside this text. A reader should probably read the Elaine Pagels book on the Gnostic Gospels before reading this one. However, for those who have never read the Gnostic Gospels this book is a nice place to find them along with the rest of The Mystical Gospels."
5,Interesting Book,Very interesting book. Helps to expand your knowledge about history and the Bible. Good reading.
1,not complete set just dummy knob,"Beware item # is wrong, description is wrong, do not oeder unless you want dummy knob in polished brass, not antique."
2,Not was I was looking for.,I think the book would have been better if it was geared more toward finding quality goods and services in New York City proper (including the outer-burroughs) than ratings of well-known cosmetics lines. Unless the lines are New York specific that information can be gotten elsewhere. I was hoping to find some good manicure/pedicure spots and hair salons. I will try the facialists and brow waxers she mentions.
1,disappointed-received bad bottle,"I love this perfume, but the bottle I got was bad. smelled only bad alcohol and light yellow_not pink. Disappointed. I purchased from Parfumusa"
3,This product has been diluted,"I have purchased this product for many years. The scent is wonderful. This recent purchase was a major disappointment! The scent is VERY weak. I suspect that the product has been diluted. Shame on you Yves Saint Laurent. Another company trying to cheat the uneducated consumer. I am now searching for another scent. By the way, I have purchased scents from this company for over 15 years."
3,Better than I expected... 3 and 1/2 stars...,"Baby Doll Paris is better than I expected. I do not know what the notes are supposed to be, but, upon spraying on my skin, the first thing I smelled was what smelled like a mixture of verbena and lime. Slowly some floral notes of rose emerged and what smelled like a touch of pineapple or subtle ginger.Actually, this fragrance reminded me of a more fruity, less sweet, more subtle version of BS Fantasy. Most of YSL's perfumes disappear from my skin in mach speed, but Baby Doll Paris is very long lasting. It also smells good on fabric. Though, I don't believe this is really original smelling, it is good in a very girly casual sort of way.Babydoll isn't bottleworthy for me, as I have other similiar scents which have a sexier feel that I like better. Tho, this is definitely one you should try."
1,not original,"very disappointed with this, have had this perfume in the past and this purchase was just not the same. smells like alcohol and not the original."
2,not so happy,"i thought this set would be have a lower profile but they stick out quite a bit. they are large and bit bit bulky. they fit nice however, very snug."
2,Very Disappointed,"Honestly, I was disappointed with this dispenser. I was willing to pay the extra money to get a great dispenser. I'm a big honey lover and go through a lot of it. I had researched honey dispensers on the web, and this one came back as the top rated. Supposedly, it was guaranteed not to drip - so I decided to spend the extra money. Well, the good news is that it doesn't drip . . . from the spout. But, the bad news is that it leaks from the top of the dispenser - where the weld is. So there is always a bead of honey on the top of dispenser. And of course, since I assumed it would work well - and since it didn't start leaking until a couple weeks after I got it, I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it."
2,Not So Hot,"Save your money -- this one is well below the usual Kalmbach standards. While the opening essay on the birth, life and end of Model Builder magazine and its editor is fine, the rest of book is a slew of poorly reproduced articles from old issues of the magazine itself. Too many of these reprinted pages have photos that are very dark or muddy (especially in the second half of the book), other pages are reproduced so small they're unreadable. Several reprinted articles are truncated, so you can't even read the full text of the original. There's no index, bibliography, or even a list of contents of Model Builder issues. To cap it off, there's an incredibly self-serving reprint about another magazine entirely -- Model Railroader -- that has nothing to do with Lionel: it's a complete waste of space in what is already a thin and expensive little publication."
3,Choices - Melody Beattie,Nice stories that relate to a positive and out of the box view of looking at things. Shows how attitude is everything and is important in our lives.
2,aweful,"these are nothing like the movies. lots of singing. more like a musical than a movie. if you think you are getting a good bundle of movies, you are not. you will be getting a musical set on a stage with pretty much a hand full of scenes. good message, but not all that entertaining. will be ordering regular movies!"
2,charger snafu,"Although it states a replacement for the BLM1 and looks exactly the same, this particular make will not charge in my Olympus PS-BCM2 Li-ion charger. It fits but the light stays red.The company issued a credit."
5,"If you haven't read it, read it!","I can only echo the praise of other reviewers. This book, and its predecessor, ""The Flame Trees of Thika"", make wonderful reading! (Take them in order.) Huxley's style is sheer enjoyment!"
1,Dont buy it,"I am using the 52x cdr and got this memorex 52x cd-r disc to burn my cd with 52x speed.But, it only supports up to 40x. I already tested it with nero and easy cd creator. Do not buy this disc. I am really dissapointed."
1,Will not burn on my Apple :(,Bought a 50 pack and the first three wouldn't work in 2 different macs so I just plan on returning the lot and getting some Imations instead
1,"Absolutely horrible, extremely error prone.","I bought these CDs to do weekly backups of my data. However, almost every time I burn one, it has errors on it. Today I wasted three CDs trying to get one good backup. This product is awful...avoid at all costs!"
1,"It's Not You, It's Memorex!","For the 3rd and final time I have been let down by Memorex CD-R. I thought that maybe the first time I had purchased a bad batch. The second time I thought maybe I'd done something wrong. This purchase will be my last. They do not play my recordings of Bach, especially Toccata and Fugue in D minor, through to the end. I used to buy the Fuji all purpose with no issues and only switched to Memorex because that is all I could find stocked at the local electronics store. Save yourself headaches and frustration; don't buy these!"
5,Very good for the price!,In my opinion there is not much big difference between the makers.Whoever is cheapest has always been fine for me.I make copies all the time because I always lose or destroy my CDs.Have a good day.
2,excelent price but not the best media,"Only the 30% of the cds that i burn work in my Memorex MP3 Player. The disk have troubles to be played on my dvd player. Also, my computer have problems to read those cds."
2,not what they used to be...,"Just bought this product after running out of (what I thought was) the same item. The manufacturer and all other specs looked the same. There was one difference - out of 50 from the old pkg, I had zero failures. So far, 3 out of 10 I have used from this new pkg have failed. Memorex has SERIOUS Quality Control issue here. They have either stopped checking or simply don't care about quality. This is my last purchase of Memorex CDs. Will be looking for CDs with more favorable reviews than I see here. Oh yeah, one more thing...the smell...whew!...a cross between burnt rubber and burnt oil...every time I open the plastic cover a very strong, not at all pleasant odor assaults your nose."
1,Complete garbage,"Picked up a 30-pack of these exact same CD-Rs after running out of Philips ones (which worked perfectly).3 out of 6 failed verification after burning. Additionally, the packaging doesn't have a hard plastic cover - it's just all held up by a piece of glossy wrapper, so the top 5 or so CD-Rs were already scratched, and the clear plastic CD-R top cover had 3 cracks. I verified that the 3 CDs that failed verificaiton indeed hang upon transfer.Going back to Philips or another brand. Memorex - never again (it used to be good years ago)."
2,No longer a quality product.,"I've bought hundreds of Memorex CD-Rs over the past couple years, and I was always happy with the quality. However, they changed their product late last year, and the new ones just aren't of the same quality as the old ones.The new ones come in a purple shrink wrapped package. I never had one coaster with the old ones, but I've been getting quite a few bad ones while using these new Memorex CD-Rs. So much so that I'm no longer putting anything important on them. I'm just using them for music mixes and the like.I'd suggest finding another brand of CD-Rs. Which is what I've done. Because the quality just isn't there anymore. It's also twice as bad because the cost of these has gone up too!"
1,Low quality,The burned CDs were very poor quality. I previously used the TDK brand and produced higher quality CDs.
4,"memorex , affordable and reliable",these cds are good quality and most burn good. at times a couple out of a 50 pack may be bad but that is good compared to some other brands like hp where i had about 10 bad out of 50. i recommend these cds and i have been using them for quite awhile.
2,A promotion for his PS actions...,"If you happen to like K. Kubotas actions - then buy them and forget about the book - really its not that much of a book but just a promoion for his Ps actions. There is a 6-7 page chapter in the book wich contains a littel image enhancement - three or four tutorials on his Ps actions.The rest - setting up PS, shooting raw ect you can read about in much better books like Martin Evenings or K. Eismanns."
4,Hillarious and Scenic,"the ending with its fabulous flying scenes, is worth the ticket,the old planes are conjuring up childhood days playing with modelsand such, the acting is good, its funny at times, tragic, yet somehowit works, when the gorgeous german WW1 a/c is disappearing behindthe green hills of the countryside, its breathtaking and may take yourtummy down with the subject."
3,Bias alert!,"Boy, I really found this to be a biased account of the military actions of the American Civil War. I think a better subtitle would have been ""...:A Northern Perspective""! Andersonville gets pages of text, while Elmira gets a paragraph or two. Confederates generals are often ""drunk"", while Grant's drinking is ""rumored""!@# Additionally, most of the ""eyewitness"" excerpts are from Federal troops.Aside from that, Eicher's effort brings much to one volume. A myriad of topics serve as digression points within the 850+ page story. Sidebar information on medicine, weaponry, use of rank and grade all add much to the oft times droll accounts of troop movement."
5,Stepping on Greatness,The Lord has elevated my husband and I in the role of Leadership in our local church. This book has allow me to see that I was not the only one who has been given something that I believed that I was not ready for. One step at a time.
1,"utter [JUNK], pardon my language...","One cannot defend ""new"" flamenco's total lack of every element that is flamenco is comprised of by simply saying ""hey...it's NEW flamenco, not flamenco...""There is not enough room here to give a symposium on what exactly flamenco is, but let me ASSURE you that this garbage is most definitely not it!For those that enjoy the evil minions of anti-flamenco, i.e. ottmar liebert (often referred to as ""fartmart lubert"" around our house...), jesse cooke, young & rollins, and other nauseating claptrap, then you will, of course, LOVE this god-awful CD. More power to you. Must be nice to be so easily amused.For those who want REAL flamenco, AVOID AVOID AVOID this [junk] at all costs, and do yourself a grand favor: buy some Vicente Amigo, Tomatito, Gerardo Nuñez, Paco de Lucia, Niño Josele, Enrique Morente...I'm going to put away my Flamenco Police badge now, and let you off with a warning."
4,Searching for Peace,"Adam and Moodley's book ""Seeking Mandela"" deals with the current situation in the Middle east and tries to see what can be learnt from the South African case that could be useful in understanding the conflict in the Middle East.The book gives a very thorough picture of the conflict both historically and up to date. For anyone who is interested to understand the situation and the different views that exist in the region this book a very good resource.Although critical of the Israeli Occupation and of the Israeli and Palestinian leadership, the authors show a strong compassion for both people. A genuine attempt to use the south african experience not as a way to attack Israel but in a search for possible answers towards a peaceful solution.Being an Israeli, terribley concerned about the deterioration in our area, and longing for peace and a just solution for all people in the region, I found this book very supportive and interesting."
5,A nice companion for other Food Histories,"Instead of providing a linear timeline of food history, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto does soemthing a little different: He writes about the several food ""revolutions"". From the use of heat, to the idea of haute cuisine, Fernandez-Armesto explores how these revolutions affected teh various cultures throughout the world.I highly enjoyed this book and it's take on food history. It clarified some points that I had been mulling over in my head, and found it a wonderful companion to Reay Tannehill's book ""History of food"""
3,Works Excellent but Breaks Quickly,The mount for my Garmin computer works great. I needed another one for a second bike. My only recommendation is to buy at least two. These mounts do not last a long time if you remove your garmin often. Unfortunately we have no choice in buying them because we must have them. They are cheaply made.
2,Not very good but this is the Garmin Mount,Far from the best but adequate if you are careful. This is the Garmin mount so I use. But be very careful that GPS is actually locked in or you will be picking your GPS off the road. Hard to keep from moving while inserting the GOS so make sure to hold the mount in place.
4,odd choice for a collection,"As usual i would have recommended different selections for this ""best of"" compilation. The long version of Minstrel in the Gallery, the songs Sweet Dream and Life is A Long Song from Living in the Past, maybe even Witches Promise. I never understood the interest in the song Too Old To Rock 'n Roll Too Young To die. That album ahs an excellent acoustic song, Salamander, by the way. Still any Tull fan would enjoy this compilation. But you are better off just going out and getting Stand up,Thick as a brick and the others."
5,Yeast,I have had great results with this spray. My dog has allergies and is very prone to yeast. I used it to get rid of the yeast between the toes and pads of her feet and now use it once a week to prevent further yeast infections.
1,"disappointing, weak vocals.",None of the power you expect from this great musical. British cast trying to have a country drawl is weird.
4,Good but longevity is too less,"Definitely it is a good perfume, sweet fragrance but only problem is longevity, I don't know whether this specific piece is defective or it's the characteristic of Cinema."
3,"no ""energy saver""","1)In the""energy saver"" mode this machine uses 25-26 watts 24/7.Customer service says the document feeder light was designed to stay on all the time (stupid).At $0.10 / Kwh, $21.60/year just to have the beast plugged in! (NO copies, prints, just to have it plugged in!2) Machine is slow to start and copy 4ppm color3) There is NO power switch. (I will hang one on the wall, with e-mail, few use faxes anymore)4) At least one fan runs for a l-o-n-g time after the machine has gone into it's version of ""energy saver""Otherwise, OK. I got it (early 2005) because my Canon PC-25 ran forever (20+ years) and MF8170c was the first under $1,000 ""all in one"" color laser.PJ"
5,One of the best sea series afloat,"I've read them all (Kent, Pope, Lambdin, O'Brian, Nelson, etc.) and this new series rates right up there with the best. Can't wait for the next installment."
3,Whomp 'em,"This book lost one star right off the bat. There are two maps of the US at the time of the action, with several cities and Indian settlements marked. Almost none of the places where the action in the book takes places are marked on the maps. I would read about a battle, then spend five minutes looking for the place name on the maps, because, well, it was a big battle, it must be there. Nope. So we're starting now from a maximum of four stars.Cartography aside, this was a not-too-bad, traditional biography. Some parts dragged, it seemed to me, because nothing exciting was happening at the time, but the author nonetheless felt obligated to describe what Tecumseh was doing at all times. Some parts were interesting and the writing was really snappy. In the end, I was left with a good view of what Tecumseh was up against, the motivations of his allies and enemies, and the state of affairs for the Indians in general."
1,Incredibly Bad _ Think of it as a small frizbie.,"This recording is a keeper and a finalist in the contest for mostest worsest drivel. (My superlatives fail me.) Any relationship to Greek music escaped me and obviously escaped the orchestra that sawed away at violins, beat tambourines and clacked castanets. The musicians(?)chose to remain anonymous for good reason. Actually they belong in the witness protection program."
3,I enjoyed this video primarily because of Henry Silva.,"""The Outer Limits: The Mice,"" starring Henry Silva and Diana Sands, 1963. I bought this video because I have had a life-long ""crush"" on Henry Silva. I think he is one of the best actors in the world, and in this video, one can see he really loves acting. He has fun with his roles. Consider that this was made in 1963 and have fun with it. Mr. Silva plays convict Chino Rivera who exchanges his ""life in prison"" sentence to be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment which is an exchange of inhabitants between earth and a planet named Chromo. The ""alien"" (Chromoite, who is one hungry dude!) will make you laugh, so remember it's T. V. and it's 1963! And is he REALLY a ""bad guy"" in this episode? Watch and see! For those of you who think of Henry Silva as a ""character actor who plays bad guys,"" you can see by his acting in this role that he can play anything. I enjoyed watching his every move. Of course, I think he's gorgeous!"
1,Unhelpful,"This book gives no helpful advice. It give unhelpful advice like ""smile all the time"" and ""pray often""."
3,HeartBreaker,The story line attracted me to this movie which was good. I was especially happy to have it in French with subtitles as my daughter-in-law loves all things French and is fluent. Story was predictable which I don't mind but I prefer more toward G than even pG-13. Not an R thank goodness. Will watch again but it won't be a favortie/classic in my DVD collection.
4,review of Heart Breaker,"Roman Duris plays a man who is used to break up unsuitable engagements. A girl's family hires him when they think the girl's fiance is wrong for her. Duris' character's back-up include his sister and her husband.Vanessa Paradis's family think that her English fiance is not right for her. Oh, he's rich and not bad looking. It's just that he's also very boring.If you've ever seen Frank Capra's It Happened One Night starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, you know how this film ends. This film mostly takes place in beautiful Monaco rather than in rundown trailer camps.Still, I recommend this film as being funny."
5,An ounce of prevention,Judy Hoffman knows her subject. This primer is the ounce of prevention that's better than the pound of cure. Think of her approach to crisis management as a low-cost but highly effective insurance policy. Her book has helped me and will help you too!
2,Nothing new,"This book is a great disapointment. I heard a lot of Mrs Richardson work, I am on her news letter list and was a little too ansious to receive this book.There is nothing new on her aproach, it is a not so well writen manual to apply sales techniques in the banking market. Somethig that any graduate can do after reading Dr Futrell's books or Spin Selling.There is too much to explore in this teme. This sould bee a more compreensive work to be whorty."
5,It's Nava'i and it's beautiful,"This is perhaps the best CD by Sima Bina, and also a great Iranian CD in general. There is something about the music and the songs that's just ""from the heart to the heart."""
2,Faded too fast,"Not very pleased with this for the price. It faded right away and did not last even a third of the summer. Must say the umbrella lasted, just not the color."
2,Pale Yellow?,"I've bought the nicer umbrellas... and cheap ones from Target. Usually they are replaced every year or every other year. This one is definitely more along the cheap end. I don't expect that it will last long. It had a reddish orangish frame, and in a pale yellow/ vanilla? cheap fabric. I was disappointed as soon as it came out of the box. I kind of expected a taupe color from the picture. Oh well, paid about [ ... ] for shipping. I'll get another one next year when it's warmer. As they say, you get what you pay for."
4,gundam review,"i love this model so much. I can't find it anywhere in my town so i order it online for the first time.most of the parts are excellent. The only problem was the core splendor(tiny plane). The nose of the plane is bent to the left sidewhen i saw that, i'm a little disappointed with it because my favorite part of this toy is the plane it self... XDthat's all.."
3,Swing ball,"Swing ball is a nice fun toy, keep the kids active and away from the TV, alway good to buy replacement part just in case of accidental breakage although the toy does look strong."
3,Limited Scope,The primary focus are the pricing issues of service providers. There is 1 chapter dealing with retailers and 1 chapter dealing with bidding on contracts. The pricing issues of manufacturers and wholesalers are largely ignored.
4,Pricing and Revenue Optimization,This is an excellent book and should be in every pricing professionals library. The only critisism I could make is that the author should be very explicit with the examples and walk the reader through the techniques used in detail.
4,Great resource,"This book is a great place to start when you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and decide you want to do something about it. Helpful, logical information presented in a very useable format."
4,This booked helped me,"The Dash Diet For Hypertension was the book that I purchased after a routine physical in December determined that I had hypertension. I have reduced my sodium intake, and followed the diet suggestions- and five weeks later have low-normal blood pressure, and I have lost 3 pounds as well. I have reduced my intake of meats, fats and refined sugar, I eat a larger percentage of fruits, grains and vegetables, and use salt very judiciously in cooking, usually no more than half of what is called for."
2,Not much new here,I was hoping for some new insight into auditioning but found none here. It's pretty much the same old thing repackaged in a new cover.
4,This is a very nice model.,"It is a very realistic looking and durable model. It was more expensive than I would have liked to pay since it is plastic. However, I display it in my office and I have received several compliments on it. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the price. You can buy with confidence."
2,Catholic Third World countries are to be blamed,"Patrick Buchanan is a Pre-Vatican II Catholic. He is an admirer of Franco (Spain), Salazar (Portugal) among others. The illegal inmmigration from Third World Catholic countries, whose population do not use contraceptic methods, are overwhelming the United States: Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, Phillipines, among others. That is the result of the absolute dictadorship the Catholic Church has on those countries. And what is the solution according to Pat Buchanan? That we should become orthodox Catholics, that is, pre-Vatican II Catholics. Ignorance and oppression of women goes hand in hand with high birthrates and illegal immigration. ...."
3,we don't need MORE PEOPLE of any race,"I agree with cutting immigration, but not for the reasons Buchanan cites. Promoting more white babies is a bad idea because it ignores ecological and resource issues that transcend race. More white childbearing would just add to our existing water shortages, pollution and congestion. We should accept that no population can grow forever and stop this insane growth binge that we call ""progress."" Halting immigration should be a way to limit total population size, not just to increase the ratio of whites in an already crowded land."
1,Sad...,"I am a christian (and Asian). I heard him talking on ""Focus on the Family"" with Dr. James Dobson and the conversation greatly disturbed me. If Mr. Buchanan truly believes in God and Jesus Christ's sacrificial love, he would know that God speaks in only one language, which is love. I was disturbed that Dr. Dobson in fact endorsed what Mr. Buchanan talks about and that kind of turned me off from listening to this great christian program. It's unbelievably disappointing that christian politicians of this great country are considered as extreme right wing and they also don't mind speaking in racist-like tone. They could be excellent role-models for generations to come, but would this kind of tone be helpful to make a better country? One could speak impeccable English and have a respectful job as an Asian, but some people will just look at you as if you are in a wrong place."
2,He came to Hampden Sydney,"Pat Buchanan did a lecture at my school promoting this book, and I attended with great interest. This is an odd book because it doesnt lead you to any great conclusion. So in 10 years there will be twice as many Muslims as Christians, and 3 times as many hispanics as whites (not accurate to the book). Basically Buchanan uses numbers to generate fear in the reader. White christians are better than everyone else so instead of integrating with other cultures we should do everything possible to stop these other cultures from having numerical dominance. The book leaves the reader wondering, where has buchanan been for the past 3o years? The book also leaves the reader wondering what action we should take. Should we nuke the muslims? castrate the catalonians? The only good point Buchanan makes is that immigrants are not ""americanized"" like they used to be. Instead of polarizing different cultures, we should find ways to better integrate and get along."
4,Very Interesting; combats pop. culture,Buchanan fires at Pop. Culture with this book. He correctly shows how our present culture can only lead to death and destruction. The Islamic culture is taking Europe over and Buchanan is one of the few who have discovered this and spoken about it. Homosexuality is another topic Buchanan writes about. He speaks out against the acceptance of this life-destroying culture. Buchanan's book is a must read.
5,A book to be proud of...,"Pat Buchanan is an excellent writer and this book is one he can be proud of. The only trouble is it's depressing....if you're of European extraction or a realist that knows who we can thank for creating this world that works so well. I agree with most everything he posited in this book and feel great dread at the future for my grandchildren and beyond. If you look at the Third World, you do not see love and light and beauty and progress being made in any human endeavor. You see death and misery and disease....and that's what awaits the earth if Western Civilization burns out. Except, in that hellish future, there will be no United States or other European nations to come to the rescue with aid and doctors and know-how."
4,Citizens of the U. S. Must Reading,"It is always wise to read both sides of any issue. How can you make a sound decision otherwise? Those who do not, only cheat themselves, and sound like fools, irrational and biased. This is a very informative book. Take what you want from it, and leave the pure opinions of Buchanan. It is full of facts and figures, with what are, well researched references. There is obviously truth to it. Certainly, this book will be resented by the illegal immigrant population in the U.S., but then, illegals have no legal right to be in this country. We are a nation of laws, and they should and must be obeyed. Wake up Citizens, this book is about the decline of your way of life."
1,A Sad Day In Literature,"I used to have a fairly good opinion of Patrick Buchanan before this book. Afterwards, I realized that it might be too much to ask for good writing and analysis skills. Death of the West provides no scientific basis for the authors assertions, some of which are absurd. For example how many of us would agree that birth control, the sixties, integration, lack of certain history courses, immigration, etc. has lead to the downfall(death) of the west? Ok even if the author believes that this is true why not show proof! Instead the author has resorted to the same conservative drive-time dribble we all suffer thru when trying to get thru the day. Don't waste you time on this one, not worth it."
1,The Death of the West: Global Corporations happy to help,"This publication doesn't actually deserve any stars. The USA is rotten because the government has sold out to global corporations. They are the ones destroying the country for its citizens. Yes! ignorant rich white people. Please don't insult me by recommending this type of garbage.Perhaps Pat could climb out of his biggoted little shell to see what a terrible mess the US cultural(sic) influence has made of most of the planet. If he cleaned up his own fetid backyard the citizens of the US may be able to lead civilised lives again. Instead the are now subject to racist propaganda, third Reichian domestic oppression, a democratic process controlled by global corporations and nihilistic policies. Please have more respect for the people of the US."
2,Good problems; poor solutions.,"The problem of the death of the west seems to be real to me after reading this book.However, one of it's proposed solutions: making USA free of immigration can do more harm than good. Because America is a land of imigrants and it should remain that way. Where else in the world can you find people from almost every country in the world living side-by-side in relative harmony? The fact that such a nation is possibel is something every human being should be proud of.The problem of death of the west stems soley,in my opinion, from cultural problems of modern times.At any rate, Buchanan has broght this problem to the attention of millions and thus given them a good start at solving it."
5,Elegy of the West,"Buchanans book details the impending demographic demise of the people who forged and sustain the insitutions and ideas we call Western civilization. In part an elegy, in part an heartfelt plea for European and American whites to wake up from there dismal plunge into racial suicide. Its a call to arms. Wake up or die!"
2,Very Disappointing - Too Many Holes in the Story,"As far as I am concerned, the author dropped the ball on this story. It catches your attention in the beginning, even though I question the accuracy of some of the legal and prison settings and situations. However, this agonizing battle that Maggie goes through becomes boring and overdone. Her friendship, though the author would like us to believe that it ran deep, did not cover the concept that she actually trusted the person she supposedly loved, even though she kept reassuring us that she did trust. There are wonderful moments in the book, but frankly it ended rather flat. It could have been much better."
3,I little washed out looking,"I like these cards, but they do have one major problem. Brand new, they look like they've been through the washing machine. The colors are very faded looking. I really like the fact that they are four color, but in low light levels the faded print creates problems. The faded colors also just give the cards an old look, like they have been played too much and need to be retired.If you can get over that part, these cards have a really nice feel, they shuffle well, and they slide over the felt perfectly. You can also wash them with soap and water if they get dirty. They hold their shape great, no creased edges or corners after quite a bit of use."
5,Inquirement of I-deas student guide,DearIs there an ESC funtion in the 'I-deas student guide' ?I am looking for the tutorial guide included of 'Electrical system cooling '.Thanks for your helpsincerelyMaxwell
1,I pity America,"Too bad one can't give zero stars - even one is excessive for a book this bad.If we survive the next four years with this doofus at the helm, it will truly be a case of divine intervention. Bush gives new meaning to the phrase ""hire the handicapped""!"
1,A Long Haul To Keep,"If what we have in store for the next four years is any reflection of the narrowmindedness, stupidity, and boring rhetoric found in this book, we have a long haul to keep."
4,Very good for beginning violinists,"While the best way to go is, of course, private instruction, this is a good place to start for beginners. The tape starts with how to hold the violin, and bow, and even how to rosin the bow, before moving on to playing. While I had to rewind a number of times to understand exactly what notes the instructor wanted me to play in the beginning, it gets (a bit) easier as you go. There's no way to make playing the violin ""easy"", but this tape, and *lots* of practice, is a good starting place."
1,Pass...,"I was dissappointed with this book. I found the lead character more annoying than engaging. Aside from a few light-hearted moments of comedy, the story didn't really seem to be going anywhere and after enduring page after page of wishy-washy characters and episodes, all I was left with was an overwhelming sense of ""so what?"". I would advise anyone looking for a good laugh to give this book a miss. Based on the reviews I read for Wilcox's other novels, I was expecting a lot more than what I ended up reading."
3,Rebuttal to Colorado Springs,"Question: what's Frank McCourt, Russian novels, or Jerry Seinfeld got to do with Wilcox?Answer: nothing."
4,nice compressor,"Love the compressor, had a small dent in the air cleaner from shipping. Porter cable sent me a new one right away."
5,Soldier's eye view of the war,"Most graphic account of major operations that I've seen. Gives the flavor of war with superbly written passages. Also emphasizes the blunders and who was resoposible for them! Highly recommended for anyone who wants ""the real story."""
5,best book ever on WWII,"I have just finished reading this book,and I have read a number of books on World War II over the years. The Story of World War II by Donald L. Miller is by far the best it covers every aspect of the war from the invasion of Poland in 1939 to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, it is well written and very hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII or not"
3,It was Okay,"I am not going to say it is the worst ppv out there, for 5 dollars(which i payed) it is worth it. At least it had a few good matches. I do not recommend it because there is much better out there. If you really want it go for it as long as you are not paying more than 10. Main event and vader/kane are pretty good"
2,They needed the HBK. Why did they even do this one?,"Every match sucked except the main event, but even that match was a bummer. I mean, it was okay, but without the Showstoppa the whole thing bummed me out."
4,really good,"i thought this tape was pretty good. some of the matches where boring and didnt need to be on there but the the nonsanctioned 8 man tag team match was awesome. it was hardcore!.table,cookie sheets,brooms,trashcans,chairs,barbwire,steel ringsteps. if you like wwf and like hardcore wrestling,buy this video or atleast rent it."
3,gmrs radios,"they work good except package says ""18 mile range"" i tried all over the area and got maybe 2 miles.even if i got 1/2 of the 18 mile range i would have given 6 stars as all else is good."
2,They weren't what we were looking for,"We purchased these radios for a family ski trip so that we could keep in touch with one another while on the mountain. We specifically wanted something compact. When they arrived, we found that they were just as big as radios we had from probably 15 years ago. I knew that I'd seen other people using radios that were much smaller so we ended up sending these back so we could try to find something less cumbersome. We never actually used them, so I can't comment on their functionality, but if you are looking for a compact radio, this isn't the one you are looking for. We wound up finding some Cobra MicroTalk radios that met our needs."
3,Good stuff,"I first saw theze guyz at a bar in GA. They put on a killa show and deff. know how 2 party. When they say they are ghetto rock, there not lying. That iz deff. a good genre 4 them. If you enjoy sevendust and hedpe then u will prolly like theze fellowz out of killeen TX."
3,Off to A Good Start,"David Nevin's historical novel, Eagle's Cry, covers the election of 1800 until the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 using the Madisons, the Jacksons, Aaron Burr, and a couple of fictional characters to tell his tale. The novel has a gripping beginning in the election of 1800 covering the tie between Jefferson and his vice presidential nominee, Aaron Burr. The book, unfortunately, loses some steam with the section portraying the Louisiana Purchase. It was not as tighly written and suspenseful as the election as it meanderend like the Mississippi itself through the lives of all the characters. It worked very hard for historical accuracy, and achieved it to a great extent, but sacrificed to history any element of surprise. The history was good but the drama suffered at times for that. Definately worth a look for the first half of the book and it is a good omen for the next book in the series as it will be dealing more with the behind the scenes Washington politics."
2,One of Nietzche's less powerful books.,"Ecce Homo by Nietzsche offers insight to his thoughts on morality, eternal recurrence, Christianity, etc. However, I did not like Ecce Homo. Nietzsche's style of writing is lofty and more idiosyncratic than his standard book. Nietzsche's insanity is read between the lines in Ecce Homo. Positive side, a good book to reference Nietzsche's meaning in his previous books."
3,Time Consuming,"If you are on a very tight time schedule might want to look else where for decent test prep. Had to look online at least twice for additional explanation on math problems adding several hours to my study load, especially in geometry section. Found mistakes in reading review. Might be better for Writing Practice, but overall I felt generally frustrated by the whole text."
4,Raiatea Rocks,"The music on this album is very Hawaiian except for a jazzed selection or two. Raiatea's voice is very nice, and I especially liked ""E Ku'u Tutu"" (I Love my Grandma). The tempo of that song is fast, and most grandmas I know of would be out of breath tapping their toes to it, but it is very pleasant. This will be one of your favorite Hawaiian albums, I am certain."
2,Fish Oil in product,"The DHA in this product comes from fish oil which is not listed on the amazon site ingredients, but is listed on the package. The product is also non-returnable."
3,"WW and Sarah, finally, a successful marriage for the Duchess","The book contains sound and motivationg information for both WW members or anyone dieting on their own, but who would really believe she wrote one word of it? I'm willing to bet her publicist and a WW PR/copywriter put this together and she just posed for the pictures. Nice companion piece to the WW program."
4,Great Product,"I really like these salts because they make your skin feel squeaky clean. Since it's just salt by itself, you need to:1) make sure your face is wet when you use it or2) add it to a face washBe careful for little cuts you might have because the salt will make it sting a bit. I gave this 4 stars because I used it up pretty quickly (washing my face with it once a day), and it was kind of expensive for the amount that you get."
5,Brilliant.,"I read this novel when it came out, and have waitedimpatiently ever since for a follow-up. Occasionally Icome to Amazon.com and check in to see ifS. Wright has anything on the horizon, but so far,no go.I remember starting this book, and I felt as every word,every scene was lighted by kleiglights. If you are a truereader, you will love this book. If not, buy a Robert Ludlumor a John Grisham.(I do want to disagree with one reader, who felt thatAnnie Proulx's ""Accordian Dreams"" didn't add up to areal novel. Novels, like houses or churches or humanbeings, can be shaped in innumerable designs. Doyourself a favor. Read both)."
4,Not for everyone,"A remarkable novel. Descriptive sentences in the first chapter will grab you. A twisted mind wrote this very sick story. When I closed the book after the last page I realized that overall I did not enjoy the experience, but that I was in awe of this writer's art. Concluded that ""Going Native"" is not a book that I would recommend to anyone I liked. If you are yearning for an emotionally tough read, go for it."
5,Shoo Fly Pie,Good deal and quick response. Would buy from them again. Great read and would recc omend it highly. Thank you for the fast shipment. God bless
1,COLUMNIST IS A TUNE WITH ONE NOTE -SOUR!,Page after page in this very short book presents a modern Sammy Glick as a columnist.Not an original idea .Everyone knows that Washington journalists became entertainers in the Reagan era ...So they earn ten times as much by entertaining the masses with pure 100% nonsense.Describing that from the inside would have made a smashing book . This one is a dreary one-noter about a Glickster on the make .
4,"Possibly, the oddest view of humanity I have read.","""Against the Fall of Night"" is a book I have read several times. I think that it offers, possibly, the oddest view of humanity I have read.We have a single city of humanity left. Apparently, humanity has reached a sort of immortality within the physical world and, yet, has chosen to huddle together. Then, it appears that there is a 'joker' in the pack of human cards. You can read about it yourself.I am smart enough to see what Clarke wants to explore here. However, I kept coming up with odd ideas that Clarke never intended. My major problem was the question of why Clarke insists on giving us such a cast of sheep. In reality, I feel there would be many more people having problems with such a long-standing status quo. Oh well, it is a good read.Read the book."
5,Love Love Love these workouts,I am 30 weeks pregnant and have been lucky enough to train with Joy twice a week for the past three years. Last night was my first work out with the Body by Trimester. I loved it. I loved it soo much I made time for a morning workout before work this morning. This video should be a gift that every pregnant girl gets!
3,THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE....,"To the author's credit, the book has some creative ideas for the garden and the book is particularly well organized. However, on the downside, Ackerman's melodramatic prose was just a little too much on the mundane side for my liking. The metaphors were ""too run of the mill"" and lacked originality. Contrary to what some editorial reviews portrayed, I did not find this book to be ""emotionally charged,"" but every reader is entitled to his or her own opinion. Personally, would I buy the book again? To be perfectly honest, no, it came up short of my expectations."
2,Quite disappointing,"I had never read one of Diane Ackerman's books so when I saw this well-reviewed in the NYT, I decided to check it out. As someone who's read a fair number of reflective garden books, I found Ackerman's prose weak and lacking in much real service. From a natural history standpoint, she wrote nothing that surprised me. I can't comment on how it compares to her previous work, but I can say that I wouldn't buy this book again."
3,Egh.,"I bought this cast iron set as a Christmas gift for my roommate. As it is only the beginning of December, I have not seen the set in action yet, however I did want to remark on the size of the skillets. They are small. Of course they meet the measurements that are on the description but somehow it seems to me that they should be at least two, maybe three inches wider in diameter."
5,Blue Collar & Beyond: Resumes for Skilled Trades & Services,This author produces the best resume writing materials on the market! This book fits perfectly for those individuals not targeted by many other resume writing books. Many of these skills are transferrable and I encourage clients to browse through the entire book.
1,Don't waste your money! Leapfrog doesn't make replacement parts for this anymore!,"My daughter likes her My First Leappad, but after several months use, the pen has wires showing! I called Leapfrog and after a series of frustrating phone calls, I find out that they don't make the replacement pen for the My First Leappad anymore! At first the customer service agent told me they have the pen and I paid for it. The package I recieved in the mail had an old leappad system that doesn't work and 2 pens that don't fit my leappad. When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money! I cannot in good conscience buy from LeapFrog again!"
3,A bit disappointing,"After enjoying ""The Da Vinci Legacy"", I was told ""Daughter of God"" was better. It was an okay read but didn't live up to my expectations. The pace was slower, the plot less focused because it constantly shifts between two different protagonists, until they get together later on in the story.""Daughter of God"" is a reworking of ""The Linz Testament"", published in the 1980s, and (as in the new edition of The Da Vinci Legacy) there are some anachronisms that don't fit with the contemporary setting (the KGB didn't exist after 1991 but they are involved in the plot, Munich is described as being located in ""West Germany"" (p. 169 and time inconsistencies (documents buried since the end of World War II are described as having been buried for ""four decades"", certain characters' ages don't add up).""Daughter of God"" wasn't bad but a bit of a disappointment after the fast paced Da Vinci Legacy, and not really worth recommending. 3-"
2,A Da Vinci-wannabe?,"I picked this up after reading Dan Brown's ""Angels and Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"", and thought this book would be in the same vein. While it does cover a Vatican cover-up of significant proportions, the execution of the book was poor, at best. Rather than turning pages, I found that I had to force myself to continue reading.The characters seem either cardboard or unlikely. For instance, a cop who suddenly turns himself into a professor of philosophy/religion. The sudden re-emergence of the KGB (which I thought died out when the Soviet Union dissolved, and was now called something like the CIS...?) A priest with shrapnel in his brain, who understandably does not wish to make any sudden moves who rides bumpy snowmobiles, springs to his feet, drops to the floor, etc, etc. Also a mystery ""American"" whose identity is painfully obvious almost right from the start.I cannot honestly say that I would recommend this book, and will probably shy away from this author's work."
5,Thank God for Great Characters and Writing,"I was so gratified to find the three-dimensional characters and great writing in this book. Zoe and Seth absolutely come alive and changed as they deal with their crisis of faith and the action. I also enjoyed the unique ways that they got themselves out of trouble.After the tin-man characters in Da Vinci Code, it was great to find this, the original by all accounts, filled with thoughtful people and history that actually stands up to scrutiny.I enjoyed Perdue's earlier book, The Da Vinci Legacy a lot, but this book is even better."
5,"Interesting, complex and exciting","The plot and background of ""Daughter of God"" are very interesting in and of themselves, and I would have been interested in reading this as non-fiction. However, the way Perdue takes the material and creates a believable and exciting thriller around them makes it even more fun to read. The characters Zoie and her husband Seth are complex, believable and interesting, whereas some mystery/thriller authors don't seem to concern themselves much with developing characters any more than necessary to further the plot. This thriller, incorporating well-researched events in history that have been covered up and are now being brought to light, has everything I like in a novel. I learn something new, I get to meet interesting characters and peek in on their relationships, and I'm taken for on a twisting, exciting journey along the way."
5,THIS DAUGHTER ROCKS!,"I was blown away that the author could maintain such suspense, action and pure emotional movement while giving me so much incredible information, all of it with a writing style that bordered on lyrical.I have never before read a book that engaged every bit of my brain and satisfied the need for speed and the desire for knowledge. It fed my soul and still keeps me thinking about what might have been and what it all means.I was prepared not to like this book, especially with some of the recent anonymous reviews from ""A reader"" but I came away with a profound respect for this author. I can't wait to read Slatewiper."
5,V&B dinner plates,These dinner plates are beautiful with understated elegance. I love this design and the finish is perfect.
4,exactly what I ordered,"No surprises here, a 15lb bag of Xylitol, is a 15lb bag of Xylitol. The fact that the bag was resealable was nice too."
1,toothpast only,"I used this once to sweeten my homemade toothpaste. I can't use this stuff as a food product, my system just doesn't like it. (Like your 94 year old, lactose intolerant great uncle just ate all the creme fraiche in France...yikes!) I swear, I ran the cat off! It works well as a toothpaste sweetner, but I could never use it for anything else and have since stopped using it at all .My one star rating is aimed at the product and my results after use. It has nothing to do with Now Foods as a company. But for the sake of humanity and global climate change.... I won't ever use this again!"
2,The packets are not large enough,"I have been using Xylitol for a couple years now after reading ""The Belly Fat Cure"" and I am addicted. I use the packets for travel. I moved to a different state and do not have access to my original brand of packets which were perfect, I think it was Emerald Forrest. These packets are much too small and I need to open about 3-4 of them for one cup of coffee/tea when I used to only need one packet of my old brand."
3,Can't taste it much....,"It certainly doesn't have an after taste like Aspartame or Splenda or other substitutes, but it also doesn't sweeten. I have put up to 6 packets in 32 ounces of tea and to no avail. It also has a horrible tendency to all settle at the bottom (requiring constant agitation before drinking). Not a fan. Trying Stevia liquid drops next..."
5,sugar,My husband uses this sugar since he is a diabetic. He likes it in his coffee and tea. It dissolves easy. It is better than using anything that isn't aspartame.
1,A HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!,This is probably the worst star wars book i've ever read. It's even worse then the Hambly and McIntyre books. All in all it is not worth reading and spends too much time on the luke and lando sections.
5,I just picked up 1.1 version of this great book and love it!,"The first ""Complete Reference"" came out just before jdk 1.1 and it was great, but didn't have the new stuff. This one covers it in perfect detail with incredibly functional example programs. Every java programmer should buy this book"
2,"OK if you're new to Java, but even then there's better books","I hate to be contradictory to the general flow of reviews, but I thought this book sucked. Perhaps it was the setting I used the book in (3rd year university transition-to-java course), but I had previously read the explanation of Object Orentation in Core Java and found that to be substantially better. I found the treatment of several areas to be rather superficial - too light to get the job done. My own combination of books when I was learning java was Java in a Nutshell, The Java Tutorial (online version) and the Java API documentation. Core Java was also useful. I say, even to beginners, look elsewhere first."
5,You Should DEFINITELY Buy This Book Unless...,"This is the best book I've read in a long while. I laughed out loud enough times to scare my fellow transit riders. I'd say if you're sprouting a few weasel whiskers of your own you will find this to be an uncomfortable read. Otherwise, you will thoroughly enjoy IDing people you know and feeling smug about it.The book itself is well-written and hard to put down once you get started. Mr. Adams has written another best-seller.I'd recommend buying this book for your family, friends and co-workers just to see how they liked it. Then you'll know who to trust in the future.In my opinion, this is a MUST READ and a great gift for the holidays. No one needs to know you'll have an ulterior motive in giving it to them, and who knows, you might find out a few surprising things about yourself in the process."
3,A book by weasels for weasels,"If I was as big a weasel as Mr. Adams assumes I am (by his own admission!), I wouldn't have bothered reading his book before writing this review. Apparently, I have a thing or two more to learn about being a weasel. The first part of this book is so over the top that it seems forced, and doesn't exactly tickle the funny bone. However, as Mr. Adams moves out of the office and begins to discuss weasels in other areas of life, it improves, and there are both good laughs and some scarily accurate descriptions of weasel behavior. As ususal, the comic strips are generally the funniest bits, proving yet again that Mr. Adams talents are best packaged in that format."
2,Does not show some streets,"Bought the street map to use in and around Grand View, ID. Several of the streets shown have changed names since this was published (which is a fact not a criticism) however many of the streets around Grand View are not shown at all thus rendering this street guide useless to me."
3,"a good, basic, thrilling read .... and yet predictable","It was a good book, yet it could have been better.It pulls you in quickly. It doesn't drag out the pre-history part. But yet once the chase begins, it becomes predictable. The ending is slightly interesting. But I finished the book because I had read 2/3 of the way through already and had to finish this 'project' ... I don't like to start a book and not finish it.I don't think it is worth the 4 stars it was given."
3,Average fare,"Miller's work here, her first solo foray after a half-dozen collaborations with the prolific Andre Norton, is not bad, but not terribly good either. Her characters might compel if she didn't insist on whisking them offstage every other chapter in order to pursue her multiple storylines. This narrative dodging back and forth should keep the novel lively, but ends up frustrating this reader instead, particularly when she yanks us out of a really climactic sequence in order to pursue some interior monologue of a minor character. Miller is clearly trying hard at her world-creation here, one of the staples of post-Tolkien fantasy, but she's trying too hard."
5,The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,"Speak or write the letter ""z"", first offense-public reprimand, second offense-public flogging or the stockades, third offense-deportment from the island of Nollop. If you refuse to go, death is the punishment.""Ella Minnow Pea"" is quite possibly the most original book I have ever read. Mark Dunn's first novel is highly creative, insiteful, with a touch of political undercurrents. Written in the form of letter correspondences, it is a quick and entertaining read. As letters become outlawed, they do in fact drop from the book, not making it harder to read (as was my worry) but only adding to its charm. ""Ella Minnow Pea"" will even give you a new appreciation for that wonderful thing we call the alphabet, as well as put a smile on your face. So, find out the fate of the alphabet and the citizens of Nollop and read this book!"
4,Great book-little difficult for people w/ small vocabularies,"The book was great besides the fact that anyone under the age of thirty would have a hard time understanding half the words. The plot is still understandable, though. GREAT BOOK!"
4,A fun book!,"I received an advance reader's copy of this book and have been thinking of it ever since. The fictional land of Nollop brings forth some interesting characters. The fact that this novel is told through letters, which are increasingly more and more difficult to write because of the crazy laws that keep going into effect, really makes this book different from many others that I have read lately. My only reason for giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found it to be a little predictable. Otherwise, this is a great story that would be an excellent selection for a reading group or even a classroom (I plan to use it in my own classroom) as it should bring some lively discussions."
4,Its a good read.,I liked this book alot. It was a fast read and I read it in 2 days. I really dont like to tell much about the story just give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. I enjoyed all 6 charaters and the story kept me interested thru out the book. Also got you a little hot too. Hehehehe.... I give it 4 Stars.
3,Liked these but never got miles out of them,Liked these but never got miles out of them.Got them with the intent to communicate during bike rides and only got short range out of them.Charging batteries didn't last long either.
2,Self-contradicting plan,"This book offers two main things- no diet to follow, and a new outlook on food for the reader. It encourages eating when hungry, in moderation, and encourages the reader to ""repattern"" thoughts away from food.That said, the book follows with sample meal plans, demands that the reader cook all meals and explains what foods are forbidden. This seems to contradict the message of eating all foods in moderation. Also the reader is encouraged to weigh themselves twice daily. Almost all doctors and nutritionists will agree that once a week is ideal for weigh-ins, and more frequency can cause obsessive behavior.This book is only for the strong-willed reader who is intellegent enough to pick and choose miss Ehrlich's methods. Many individuals with addictive tendencies, such as those targeted by this book, could find themselves in a spiral of bad behaviors and obsessions."
5,Awesome,"Great worship time with God. The live songs are awesome. I really enjoy hearing all of the people sing along with ""Love Song"" And gives a new feel to ""Your Love, Oh Lord"". I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to worship God."
3,antonio aguilar en vivo,mucalmente hablando esta bien pero la filmacion esta muy mala y el sonido esta bien pero fallido quiza pudieran tener mejores opcionesd
5,The Ideal Guidebook for a Board's #1 Priority,"CEO Succession is precisely what companies, executives, and their boards need in today's highly volatile environment. By establishing the principles and best practices of succession in a highly readable way, Carey and Ogden provide a compelling roadmap for boards and top executives to follow to ensure that leadership continues unabated into the future."
4,"Good product, good service","I needed a song that was supposed to be in this book. I ordered the book, and the song was there. The book looks new and is all there, but some pages were crinkled in the corner--not a big issue, but not perfect either. I would do business with these folks again."
1,Thorn Birds for the birds,My wife and I looked forward to this purchase but unfortunatly when we played it it skiped which made it impossible to watch. We played it on two different DVD players with the same result. I plan to return it for a replacement.The Thorn Birds Collector's Edition (The Thorn Birds / The Thorn Birds 2 - The Missing Years)
4,Refreshing Sounds,"The more I listen to this album, the more I get hooked. The lyrics have an edginess to them and is a refreshing change to music fans wanting something different. Musically, the band takes its direction from some popular artists, such as Paul Simon and Rusted Root, but has managed to interject some very original touches.If you like a band that can actually play their instruments, write their own songs, and are able to actually sing, then buy this album. I promise you won't be disappointed."
3,Let B be a book...,"Entertaining biography of Erdos. Interesting to know that he could visualize complex mathematical problems but not simple chess problems. Reduced rating by 1 notch because the book twice states John Von Neumann invented the digital, electronic computer. That honor goes to Eckert/Mauchly of the University of Pennsylvania. See Eniac by McCartney for further reference."
4,Sympathetic insight into the world of mathematicians,"I enjoyed this book and thought that Bruce Schechter did well to get across the humanity of the man and as well as some of his ideas. Inevitably, the mathematics contained in the book will seem a bit hard going for some but Schechter handles it delicately and manages a fair balance.The book is written in an approachable style and has a deliberately non-critical and inspirational tone. I recommend that it should be put in the hands of any teenager who is thinking of studying mathematics at university. If she/he does not like the ideas and characters described, he might be happier choosing another major!"
3,rudy ring,"Item was smaller than i thought it would be, but i did not measure the size on my own from your description, that was my fault. it is a nice ring though"
5,Absolutely the best!!!,"I had wanted to get this book for years, and now that I have it I can't stop glancing at its pages. The book is so rich in history, the houses chosen are awesome, and Ange Bourda's work is impecable, as always. A book worth having on your collection to make you proud you are Guatemalan."
5,Makes me home sick!!!!!,"I just move to the usa and because I wanted to have something that reminds me of home with the decoration of my apartment I had to buy it I saw the book in a furniture store in Antigua Guatemala days before I left but I couldt buy it!!I decided to search and I found it, I am so happy"
1,"BRILLIANT music, worthless ""remaster""","I waited years for a remastered version of ""Caravanserai"". I honestly think it is one of the greatest pieces of music of the 20th century - right up there with works by Miles Davis, Aaron Copland, the Beatles, etc.So what do we finally get? A mix with little bass, little clarity and no dynamics. It looks like the only way anyone will be able to fully enjoy this music from now on is if they can find an old vinyl copy. As other reviewers have pointed out, Sony didn't even bother to put much effort into the liner notes - nope, just cranking out another McCD for the masses. Very sad."
2,Immersion Heater,"This heater worked really well the first three times I used it, but broke the fourth time. I wrote to Ace Hardware and they sent me a free replacement, but that broke the second time I used it. I may have been doing something wrong (possibly you have to let it cool for a certain amount of time before re-using it?), but my overall experience with this product was extremely disappointing. I gave it two stars just because while it WAS working it worked great, and it really did heat the water very quickly."
1,Used once and oops!,"It would have been good if the directions that came with this unit told me that if I pull the unit out of water while it is still plugged in, it will short out and cease to work. It heated up the first cup of tea and I was impressed, I then proceeded to pull it out of the water first and then unplugged it. I went to heat up another cup of tea and the unit was completely dead! Nothing! I left it in the water 20 minutes, unplugged it, tried it twice more, half an hour the next time...nothing. The unit died. It seemed strange for such a simple unit to fry so quickly...but it did so i can't say anything good about this purchase. Don't buy it.."
4,Immersion heater,"Purchased about a month ago and it works great. I have only used it a couple times, but has performed well."
1,nordic water immersion heater,"Item arrived in sealed package, but did not work. I sent it back to the supplier, ""Crazy Dave's Tool Shed"". I was credited for the product and my shipping, very reliable and helpful company. I am very happy with the customer service, too bad the product did not work :("
3,Slow heater,This heater works but very slowly. It takes about 12 minutes to bring 16 ounce cup of water to a boil. I bought it for travel and it is very compact.
1,This heater is just waiting for you to screw up.,"I had this heater for maybe 3 days when it shorted out. I read the instructions and did not plug it in until it was submerged. I read reviews stating how you had to have it in a liquid or it would short out. Maybe someone should have said it needed to be COMPLETELY submerged, almost all the way to the handle. In my opinion it's not worth a penny."
1,NORPOR 559 Immersion Heater for Warming Liquids,I purchased in water heater for a friend in Mexico who could not locate one there. It died within a week after he received it when a power outage occurred while it was in use. I would not purchase this product again.
3,Its ok,Gonna use it to make my own coffee on a cruise ship.None of them big ships can do coffee right.I hope it lasts a week.daboss
3,Does not like 64-Bit Vista Ultimate,"I bought this printer from Amazon two years ago. It works and prints beautifully and the features (networking, card slots, photo blue and photo black ink availability) are wonderful. Occasionally it fails to pick up paper but cleaning the dust off the rubber rollers fixes that in short order. However, I was forced to purchase a new computer with Vista when my XP machine died. I loaded the Vista driver but the printer does not work well at all under Vista. It cuts the bottom inch off of 8.5x11 pages and puts 1/2-inch borders on the bottom and right side of 4x6 or 5x7 photos. HPs solution is to use 8.5x11 photo paper and cut them down to size but I find this unacceptable since the printer worked flawlessly under XP. Now, when I want to print photos I have to send them to my old laptop that still runs XP and then they print fine...if I didn't have the old laptop I'd be throwing this expensive printer in the trash."
3,It's OK,"This is more a pamphlet than a book. It gives some brief ideas about facial shapes, planes for drawing. It is a brief description of facial proportions adults, children's and infants. It's interesting and was a reasonable price."
2,"Heads, Features & Faces","It is okay,but I have not used it yet. Nothing else to add until I experience the book. Come on!"
1,A dud,"Although I finished this book, I really don't know why. I guess I kept telling myself that no book could be THAT bad, but looks like I was wrong. I don't even know where to begin to explain all that is wrong with this story. The storyline was silly to the point of stupid, the romance was a complete dud, the dialog absolutely cheesy and forced, and the ending didn't do a thing to revive or explain this story. I know this author can do WAY better than this, so it will not stop be from reading other books by Cara Summer. However, this one is not recommended."
3,How to help your daughter to make it in a patriarchy,"I found the book interesting, but I can't say I would endorse it. I have 3 daughters.It did bother me that there was no question of how we as a society measure success. Rather than helping my daughters to only feel good if they achieve wealth and status, I hope to focus on real success. Changing peoples lives, especially their own. They did little to highlight the lives of women who have taken the road less traveled, and far less patriarchal. The glaring statistic to me was that 80% of these women had mothers who stayed home until they were in school. No kudos for this, only that these moms eventually went back to work was given real glory."
2,Ho Hum,"This isn't a bad product but it isn't great either, its over priced and under powered for a company that specializes on hair, I expected a little more, the biotin content in minimal."
5,NOT HEAVY METAL,"While I believe that 'Benefit' IS the best of all Jethro Tull albums, it is extremely misleading to shoppers looking for positive reviews and suggestions of what to buy to call it a HEAVY METAL album or JETHRO TULL a HEAVY METAL band.The band's roots were in BLUES and they were initially a Blues/Rock band. 'Benefit' itself is a transitional album. It is a brilliant mix of blues, rock and some folk and even jazz influences that would become more important for the band, particularly after 'Aqualung'. But it is NOT, in any way, HEAVY METAL.If you are looking for a top-quality album, certainly one that belongs in anyone's collection, check this out. If you are only looking for an addition to a Heavy Metal collection---don't bother."
4,best liquorice,delicious! love the individual packaging. now ready to try the blueberry pom flavor. always fresh and much easier to order from here.
5,My Darrell Lea Favorite!,"I have tried most of the Darrell Lea line and this one is my favorite. I have never cared for black liquorice, so I was very excited when I found out that Darrell Lea came in a range of flavors. It's a soft, chewy piece of solid liquorice. I found that it wasn't overly sweet for me, but it might be for others. Has a true mango flavor!"
1,Couldn't finish this one,I started listening to the unabridged book on tape. I had to struggle to listen to the 1st side of the 1st cassette. I stopped after that. There was nothing I enjoyed about the storyline.
1,"Nice try, but no cigar","While Mr. Geisst provides some interesting tidbits in the history of antitrust law, he fails to provide a coherent narrative of this important subject."

1,wasting money,"like a million other people have said,Digital signal equals no loss of quality so cheap cables perform at the SAME level as these waste of money cables. Length is an issue? get the cheap 12 meter cable for 20 bucks! go search you thrifty shopper!"
1,The worst songs,"This is truly one of the worst collections of girl group songs ever. The most annoying, self pitying lyrics along with uninventive melodies. I thought I would get at least one gem in this 22 track package. Instead, I thought about reselling it. There's no Johnny Angels here. Just junk."
1,Don't buy it!,"This product is no longer supported by the manufacturer, and many of the programs have a defective program disc (missing file) that prevents installation. It is a great program, with a good price but if you must buy, get one used that works!! Otherwise it is a gamble!!"
1,WON'T Install on Dell Laptop Running Vista,"Will not install on my Dell Inspiron E1505 Laptop running Windows Vista. Nova Development gave me a few suggestions, but it would not install. They offered me a refund."
5,First it was TQM ... now it's GOD!,"Stephen Grave and Tom Addington have done a wonderful job of throwing down the gauntlet to born-again Christians to be the salt and light the business world so direly needs. This is a ""what to do"" book, not a ""how to"". But nonetheless, the book's message is a fresh message for a tired world. I am a small business owner who openly witnesses his faith in Jesus. But The Fourth Frontier woke me up that I'm not the ""very, very"" person God wants me to be, e.g. very good in business and equally very knowledgeable about the Bible."
1,utter [junk],"First off conceptually this album is a horrible waste. You are much better of just buying a couple of the four albums represented here. Everything on here is easily available from elekra records.Secondly everything on this album is utter [junk]. The upbeat old schooled songs aged horribly, and don't even compare to early prodigy. The chilled out Ambient tracks range from horribly repetitive to cliched ramblings that you could come up with playing with a couple keyboards. Seriously I mean a piano playing with rain? thats never been done before. Your better of getting a rain CD and playing it over some classical piano. Even when I find myself into a track just a bit.. it finds it self in a horrible never ending loop that doesn't change. Everything on here sounds like it should have come out before 94, since all the synths used are of the cheapest variety. None of this can be called ""intelligent"" in any way. Its a...collection of bad tachno."
1,Guy plays a mean computer,Are people ever going to get tired of these people who record the work of real musicians and add their own ... signature and pass it off as something creative? I guess it is further evidence that the de-evolution of the planet is in full swing.
4,Not for everyone!,"It worked great, and I hope to use it again one day. But you don't need it, if your not experienced trap shooter. MY TWO CENTS."
1,A joke,"Why is it so hard for this Wilson guy to get an interview with Moore? There's another anti-Moore documentarian who found Moore on the street and just walked right up to him and Moore gladly gave him an interview. It's online if you would like to see it. Others have proved how easy it is to get in touch with Moore if you really want to. Mike Wilson didn't want an interview with him because he wanted to make a movie. Plain and simple. This ""film"" is about nothing."
1,I LOVE AMERICA,Michael More is a complete idiot!! He needs to leave this great Country...For Good!! Quit supporting his stupidity...Don't buy the fictious film...
1,just pure self indulgence,This is just pure self indulgence with no ability to connect any threads with an overall effort as juvenile as its title.The film focuses on the minutia of detail not the major points of Moore's documentaries. For example it spends a significant amount of time on the issue covered in Bowling for Columbine of where exactly a local Bank gives free guns away to it customers. When the major point is A LOCAL BANK IS GIVING FREE GUNS AWAY TO CUSTOMERS.This Film Maker doesn't seem to have a point other than his own belief's that he is right and Michael Moore is wrong. He's given the opportunity on a TV news show to explain his point of his film project and what he wants from Moore and it is just as incoherent as his film.In regards to the interview the film maker wanted with Moore I believe he never had any desire to Interview Moore and would have done even worse then he did in his TV interview had he gotten the chance.
2,Just plain silly,"Let me start of saying that even though Micheal Moore has made some very provocative and entertaining documentaries, I agree that he has been known to manipulate his material for persuasive reasons. Is that really a revelation? Most filmmakers, as ""unbiased"" as they might claim to be, have some sort of agenda. That same is true of the author of this documentary. The title and premise of this film is really quite silly. I am not sure how Evert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up, but I suppose it is not the first time I have disagreed with them. Anyways, I just find it ironic that a filmmaker would make a highly biased documentary attacking the biases of another documentarion."
1,not worth seeing,"...I couldn't finish the thing. It's boring, petty, and obnoxious. Plus, it demonstrates Michael Moore's skill as a documentarian through its makers' obvious lack of talent. I'm guilty of contributing money to this pathetic endeavor, but I hope you save your money."
2,Disappointing,"First, this book doesn't take long to read. You can sit down and read this book in several hours.Which is probably the amount of time Deaver took to write (or dictate) the book.This book has no depth of any kind.Reagan-lovers will find there are no ""new"" stories, nor unexpected revelations.Reagan-haters will find the book utterly devoid of any meaningful content.I am quite fond of Reagan, and was disappointed there was not more here."
4,LIKE IT A LOT !!!!!!!,"As the previous reviewer I can say I am totally satisfied for the price with this digital camera. To the contrary as mentioned by another reviewer (who precisely mentioned he was no-techie - OBVIOUSLY!!!), serial is easy to use to transfer your photos but if you don't like it, just buy a little adapter that connects to your USB port and this adapter will read your Smartmedia card in a flash!"
1,Not worth the money,Very difficult to make the connection with the computer work properly. It would take up to 30 Attempts (each resulting in a full reboot) before the camera successfully made a connection.After owning it for one year the camera quit working. Which was ok because now I can buy a nicer one!
5,Toni Blake at her finest!,"As someone who has read and enjoyed each book this Author has written, I must say that Toni Blake's transition from Catagory Romance to Single Title brings the talent that she has shown in previous writing to it's fullest potential. ""The Red Diary"" is wonderfully written, and combines all the best aspects of a truly good book. Nick has a stormy past and holds Lauren's Father responsible for it all. What starts off as a means of revenge turns into something that keeps you turning pages until the end. The story that weaves around these characters is one that will touch you deeply, and will definately earn a spot on the keeper shelf!"
1,Poorly done,"This book was really disappointing. Rather than provide great trivia in interesting stories, this provides an annoying long list of questions and answers. Some of the questions are really stilted, working hard to fit a piece of information into the question and answer format. I found a few interesting pieces of information I was not familiar with, but there isn't enough story around it to share with others. I will have to look up anything that may be of real interest. I do not recommend this book."
2,MX II Dirt bike lift stand,I will have to modify this to make it work which means I have to invest a few hours of my time plus the cost of a piece of 1 x1 x 10 tube. The design requires the roller to roll on a round tubing below the platform and it does not work correctly even with no load - the keeper pin pops off allowing the roller to slide off the lever. They should have used a square tube shapped bar for the roller to roll on (a flat surface).
5,Very Informative Reference Book for Civil War Enthusiasts!!,"This uniquely done Desk Reference book from the Library Of Congress does a very deep dive into areas not always covered in other Civil War books! Causes of the War, in detail, key factors that effected the War or impacted battles or strategies makes this work a very worthwhile investment for anyone interested in knowing more about the War Between The States! With over two hundred books in my Civil War reference library, this one earned a place of honor!"
3,Civil War Reference Book,"This work is relatively easy to read. I do not believe it was written to be read, cover to cover. I believe it was written to serve as a general reference and ""cross reference"" - it does fulfill that niche."
3,Not as dark smoked as I thought,"This product looks good, but in daylight it is not as dark as I would have hoped. The tail lights I installed on my black truck look great, this unit, maybe due to the smaller size, shows the silver reflective backing much more so it looks like black chrome in the daylight, not what I was looking for. The fit is about 80%, not a perfect fit and could be better. It is bright and does look good but thinking on going back to the red OEM light."
4,Has All of Them,"If you love JP II, all his encyclicals are here in language everyone can understand. It may not be strictly loyal to the original, but it is important that his message gets through."
2,Could have been a lot better,"Don't you hate it when a drama is labeled as a comedy? Anyway, there were only three things this movie had going for it; the script, the theme (What is considered to be a beautiful woman? ), and Micheal Rappaport's very juvenile character as the only comic relief in this bore *sorry Rosie*. ""Beautiful Girls"" had the potential to be a nice male soap opera, but it couldn't hold my attention. I considered the part where Matt Dillion's character landed in the hospital the ending and just turned the VCR off. I'm sure that I didn't miss anything beyond that part."
5,Collectors Item,"This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. I came across it by accident on satellite TV about 3 years ago. I decided to tape it and ended up watching it as well, then watched it again the next day and again a couple of days later. I was gripped from the beginning. There are lots of memorable scenes like Rosie O'Donnells' lecture in the convenience store, and Natalie Portmans' discussions with Timothy Hutton about Shakespeare.Just watch it and you'll know what I mean.All the characters were fascinating including Richard Bright who played Willy's (Tim Hutton) father, and David Arquette who played his brother.This is one of 5 films that I have permanently on video. The others being Godfather I,II,III, and Goodfellas.Enough said?"
1,Hollywood trash,"Timothy Hutton. I guess there's a reason that he died off- he can't act his way out of a paper bag. And how many times do we have to see Natalie Portman in a movie before everyone collectively screams enough already?But THE MOST ANNOYING THING about this film is the flippin' Neil Diamond Sweet Caroline scene that has forced us to have to listen to that stupid ""duh,duh,duh"" everytime the once great song was played. Seriously annoying."
1,Yuk!,"If you're going to call a Movie ""Beautiful Girls"", the last person you want in it is Rosie O'Donnell!!! She's not only ugly on the outside, but ugly in the inside!!!!!!! The foul garbage/hate that comes out of that mouth! To bad for the rest of the great cast."
1,Get With It Amazon. This is NOT A REMASTERED EDITION!!,As far as I can tell 'Get Nervous' has never been issued in a remastered format. Certainly the one listed here IS NOT A REMASTERED VERSION. GET WITH IT AMAZON. How about a little truth in advertising?????? It is a great album but this is the original 1984 release.
1,"3 bad movies, 1 low price!","This is a good bad movie, I like talking about how bad movies are and this one has plenty to talk about. And it has a cool cover, perfect.A couple walks into a DVD store and is deciding what movie to rent, they don't want that weak Hollywood horror. They pick up a title called ""Damnation."" I've already seen Damnation so at this point I'm trying to think of any way that I can stop these two from renting the movie. Damnation was bad, like, unwatchable bad. It leaves you confused and angry, you're not confused about a plot twist, you're confused as to why anyone would make this movie.My pleas go unanswered, they rent the movie along with ""The Pickup"". So basically, all they do is watch these two movies without adding any real commentary. So if you've already seen one, or both of these movies you don't need to watch this movie."
3,Interesting . .,"This program brings up good questions and the evidence looks convincing but a DNA test would give an absolute answer. Sadly, 90% of this show was the same thing being repeated over and over again. Also there is another thing, in the begining the historians talk about the battle of Kadesh. What in the name of Ra does that have to do with the story of the Exodus? Very little if you ask me. I think they were ""trying"" to connect the two. (well if Ramses the second lied about the victory at Kadesh, then he may have lied about the Exodus too)Let's Find some undeniable evidence before we start trying to rewrite history, okay kiddies!"
1,Bleeds in first use!!,"It is a beautiful shower curtain and love the material... but I put this up and after the first time of using it, it was purple and red and grey from the colors bleeding! One time of use and now it looks horrible! Dont waste your money on this! I dont understand why they would make something for water with dye that would bleed?"
1,"beware readers, not all is as it seems","[....]Read the ENTIRE text before you choose to comment.I have no personal stake in this matter, however, I cannot know this is happening and keep silent."
5,Tea at its finest,"I have enjoyed pg tips since I lived in Bermuda 12 years ago. When I found tips in the commissary about 4 years ago I was ecstatic! Unfortunately, they stopped carrying it. I searched online and found the best deal on tips through amazon. I am once again in tea heaven. Thanks Amazon."
2,"Good, but there are better ones","This book seems a little hyped. I found the book ""Quizzing"" to be a much more fascinating read."
5,A Humbling Story,"This book brings the details of Germany during WWII into vivid light. The story of a family in Hitler's Germany during WWII told through the eyes of a young boy, Dieter.An amazing account of the early 1940's in Nazi Germany by a not so enthusiatstic German family. A great read."
3,Decent book...,"This book is OK, but slightly out dated. There are some really good points and is very easy to interpret into your own life."
5,Great compressor! Top Notch!,"This compressor comes with a 4-port air regulator, which lets you run 4 tools at once from the compressor. (most cheaper compressors do not even come with a regulator, let alone a 4-port connection)It is very well built and easy to maneuver. The specs say 82db for operating noise -- I just know it is relatively quiet. The two-stage motor is quieter and more reliable than cheaper single-stage motors. So, you may pay more for this compressor, but you get a better machine!If you are a contractor or a homeowner, this is a great compressor."
2,Not very helpful,"This potty doll does not facilitate potty training very well...He does not actually use the potty and I found with my 27 month old that he needed to see where the ""pee"" was coming from and where it went. Elmo does not have to take a drink from the sippy cup to go potty...any object will cause him to gulp...Over all I would recommend it only to those who are introducing the thought and not those who are going to use it during the training process."
5,Great potty training tool,"My son loves this Elmo. He started using the potty the day he received it. He is still learning, but the elmo doll is a great reminder to him."
3,Cute toy,"My daughter was a big fan of Elmo. I bought this toy for her hoping that it will help us with potty training. After playing with it couple times, my daughter lost any interest she ever had for Elmo."
4,Great concept,"The Potty Elmo I feel is a great concept and for some kids would work really well. Though it did not work for my daughter. It's hard to rate teaching toys for kids, just for the simple fact that all kids are so different. It's worth a shot to at least try and even if your child is like mine and it doesn't work at least they still have a pretty neat toy to play with. Ashlee loves to give Elmo his drink and then make him sit on the potty. I feel she may still be a little to young to understand that's what she is suppose to do also. So I'm rating this with four stars just on the basis of it being a good toy. Should you decide to buy this product and it work, then great, if not don't sweat it!!!"
2,"Fun, but difficult","The toy itself is a hit for 2 - 2 1/2 year olds; however, the way it works doesn't really make sense. Intuitively, one would believe that if you put Elmo on the potty that he wouldn't give the ""didn't get to the potty"" in time comment, but that is not how the toy works. The children seem to love it though! Would be better with volume control :-)"
4,"Sloppy writing, but good characters and situations","I enjoyed reading about these women and their problems. Never a dull moment. However, I was annoyed by some of the writing. There were a lot of long, loopy sentences that were not written with correct parallel construction. I know that is a quibble, but I felt that the author and/or editor were lazy."
3,music to top yourself by,"While not as impressive or varied as their previous record 'philiphobia', Elephant Shoe still has its own distinct charm. It comes on like a Joy Division record made by the producers of Trainspotting and as such its morbid tone will undoubtedly put a lot of listeners off. While on first listen it may just sound overly depressing, careful listening will reveal the subtle beauty beneath the ugliness. Some British journalists have described Arab Strap and this album in particular as music to top yourself by, they obviously musn't have listened to the album's standout track tanned; lyrics that could well have been a great short story augmented by a beautiful trumpet solo and hypnotic guitar. This isn't a perfect album by any means but its good moments make it well worth repeated listens."
4,Heavyweight expose of conservation corruption,"I think this is an important book - a scholarly exposition of the deep contradictions which lie at the heart of many misguided government conservation programmes. My only criticism is that Safina occasionally gives a little too much detail on some of the congressional shenanigans which have shaped US government decisions in various wildlife protection programmes. However, the book manages to combine serious and detailed research with good writing - a rare event."
4,qbpro2007,"good product; makes my job as treasurer of an organization much easier, including payroll functions."
2,Forced to buy a product that I did not need!,"In 2007, Quick Books came up with a new policy not to support their accounting software before 2005. The upshot being if you use their payroll service (costs about $189 yearly) you are required to update to the 2007 version of Quick Books Pro. After using the 2007 version for 6 weeks, I can see no benefit. It is cumbersome, full of bugs (I'm not able to do auto updates, a feature that worked very well on the 2004 version) and difficult to learn. To make matters worse their support is the worst. After using Quick Books for 11 years, I'm locked in but franticly looking for a way out . If you have options look at a different products. Talk to an accountant, consider Peach Tree."
4,Quickbooks 2007,A nice layout without a need to drastically learn new processes for the the functions. Conversion of old files to the new version was good. I wish they offered an upgrade. I was happy with the 2004 version but to prevent problems because of Microsofts enhancement I had to buy the 2007 version.
3,Difficult to Learn and Not for Every Business,"This software is very difficult to learn-as-you-go. I am a former Quicken user and while that was easy to fumble through while learning without too much fear of making a far reaching mistake, Quick Books is laden with important-seeming details and hard-to-master steps and pre-labeled categories that don't seem to be applicable to my business. This software may be very helpful for a business that buys widgets from the widget wholesaler using an invoice and then sells the widgets to a customer using a bill of sale. It doesn't do much for someone who sells his services on commission without using invoices or bills. Self-employed professionals need not buy this software. Even the check register is harder to use and almost impossible to customize than Quicken was. I do not recommend this software at all."
5,Pro 2007,Much easier to use and install than earlier versions. also much easier to share with my accountant.
3,Not a major change,"OK, they changed the home page a bit, and they use XML. But they real changes are not truly important. I bought the upgrade because of issues with compatibility between QB 2006 Pro and IE7. At the time the Intuit website said they did not have a date for a fix. Wouldn't you know it? They came out with a fix a few days after I installed the new version."
3,You're on your own with QuickBooks,"Great product but laughable outsourced support service.You would think with all the money Intuit is making from this product they would spend a little on training their staff in New Delhi.So, keep your sense of humor if you have to call in. Luckily most of the issues I ran into I was able to figure out myself."
2,2007 version really went downhill...,"Just upgraded to 2007 version. While I write this reveiw, my Quickbooks Pro is only 46% through sorting the labels I asked it to print. Whether it be one label or 10, expect to spend 10+ minutes EACH time you want to print customer labels. Since printing labels and making invoices is a huge part of my business, this version basically ruined a good thing. Please note, I am using very recent and beefy computers - printing labels is now a bigger headache than it ever was. For the first time in a long time, I will now be looking for alternatives."
2,backup problems galore,I have been a quickbooks user since 1995. Wouldn't use anything else. I updated from 2004 to 2007 version of Pro. I have been extremely disappointed. I cannot back up my data. They have over improved a very good product. I am trying to get a older version to replace the 2007 from QB.
2,Come on now!!,"This book could have been better. I dont advise anyone to buy this, maybe borrow it. The front of the cover should have been a hint hint clue clue, but I bought it anyway. There are differnt srories going on and they are not to interesting. Once it begin to get interesting its drops back down to its low point. I have read better, but at the same token have read worse. If you are interested into thugged out book keep moving, if you wanna take your time than read this book because its gone take a min to get through it."
4,Multi-purpose...,"A really great little vacuum, I use it mainly to clean up after myself in my woodworking shop (hobby shop stuff) but I find it can be useful as a vacuum in almost any job where you need to get into small spaces (computers, machinery, etc.) I would have given it five stars except for the following: first the power switch is a three position (Hi-Off-Low)toggle type switch that does not provide either a clearly marked or positive swith position control, second if you lay the vacuum down on a flat surface the motor torque tends to roll the vacuum to one side and possibly into or off of something...These may seem trivial but they are annoying oversights of an otherwise thouughtfully designed cleaner."
3,Average Album,Eh - it's ok. I heard the single Lost off of Pandora and made an impulse purchase.The rest of the songs are just average. Even for 8 bucks it wasn't really worth it.
1,A great bedtime sedative....,"The review about the CAT Scan says it all. I am an avid reader, and it is rare that I not finish a book, but I cannot and will not finish this book. Goodnight."
5,A helpful hint for critics...,You might actually try to READ THE BOOK before spewing. Thank you for your patient consideration.
3,"Liberals won't read this book, but...","...you'll sure see their reviews here. Typical ranting based on perception rather than fact.(I have not yet read the book either, so, despite the required star rating, I have no opinion.)"
1,Right-wing Paranoia hits a new low,"Let's see now - every major institution in this country is populated by Christians as the vast majority, including the courts, yet somehow these same Christians are persecuting the Christian church. Makes sense, doesn't it? No, what we have in Mr. Limbaugh's silly book is a few examples of goofy over-reaction - not public policy - to our long-cherished tradition of the separation of church and state. It takes a very paranoid viewpoint to hold that this represents a national trend or a danger to Christians. Selling it to a gullible public requires some real chutzpah (forgive the word, Christians). But then, his last name is Limbaugh, isn't it?"
1,Always seperate church and state,"For years groups like the Christian Coliation, The 700 club, and the Promise Keepers have tried to force there beliefs into American politics, and under the current administration they have been very succesful. Our founding fathers started this country to have a goverment FOR THE PEOPLE not for GOD. The great thing about America is people can believe whatever they want to believe so long as it dosen't infringe on the rights of others. Well extreme Christians are trying to take away our rights and make us believe their way, if this is allowed to happen them we are no better then the terrorists who try to force their beliefs on the innocent. Believe what you want but dont try to make me."
3,Very helpful,"This book really helped me learn how some of the things I don't understand about men are biochemical in nature. Testosterone is a very powerful drug. As our sons mature, some of the behaviors that they exhibit are directly attributed to these hormones. The authors describe the physical and emotional processes boys go through to become men and identify with their gender. I found it most illuminating. They also give lots of information on how to get your son to harness his energies in a productive manner and how to help him do so if he does not already."
5,Raising a son,"A very well-written book with lots of good advice, easy to read and an excellent structure. On the one hand, I learnt so much about the ""male mind"" that had had me baffled before and, on the other, the book helped me to feel more confident about the approach we had been using by explaining why it is good-rather, necessary- to do certain things and act in certain ways. There are many examles to back up what is being said and the bibliography is excellent. I have nothing but praise for it!"
3,Something has to be done,"The premise of this book is an interesting one. Most men end up being self-absorbed hedonists because they have not been raised correctly, and most importantly, their mothers have not been a strong enough presence in their sons lives.Boys can be very destructive if they are not kept in line by the women, who will be hurt if they do not stand their ground."
2,average soul CD,"Their debut was so strong but the follow up is disappointing....no real hits or hooks...it sounds like a different lead singer too....what happened? Well, they have some prominent guests like Coolio but that doesn't make a hit alone"
2,"Great reception, but OUCH","I was really excited to improve my reception on my Inno by getting these headphones. And yes, the reception was very reliable, particularly in places where the signal is weak. (But nothing, alas, will boost reception to the gym in my office building's basement.) The problem is, ten minutes wearing these bad boys and the inside of my ears were in pain. The plastic is just too hard or the headphones just squeeze too tight or something. It feels like I'm wearing a vice or a clamp around my head. If I had to do it over again, I'd find another set of antenna headphones that were more comfortable. I don't even know if such a thing exists. If you have a high pain threshold and don't mind discomfort, these are the headphones for you."
1,Works but hurts,"I found that the Belkin XM radio antenna works well for quality of sound and signal strength. The ear pieces, fixed position, hurt my hears; they are large and protrude into the ears."
3,Function over Comfort,"These headphones dramatically improve the reception of my XM INNO2 (which is pretty good to begin with). I was able to get a strong signal in my house and in my garage. While walking around town, I rarely had a lapse in reception. Unfortunately, these are the most uncomfortable things I have ever put on my head. The hard plastic ear pieces are painful to wear for more than a few minutes. Running is difficult because the constant jostling results in jabbing ear pain and/or extreme discomfort. The ear buds that came with the Pioneer Inno2 are suprisingly comfortable, so I use those most of the time, but when I want to listen to a baseball game and I can't otherwise get good reception I'll throw on these, even though it's like wearing a 13th century torture device."
3,Maybe So-- Perhaps not,"This is my third pair..Obviously I must really want this product to work --Does well out of the box and performs as advertised----Unfortunately my other two did not last more than three months---Just stopped working for no apparent reason--It seems something goes wrong with the coupling which attaches to the radio--(I use several other similar antenna connections (in my car and at home) with no problems--- With this third and last pair I will make sure the satellite radio is powered OFF when connecting or disconnecting this antenna headphone set. Perhaps not doing so with my other two pair caused my problems. Otherwise it is is clear to me that the construction of this product is far to delicate for its intended use. I never bothered with whatever the warranty process is, if applicable."
1,uncomfortable headphones,These are the worst headphones I have ever owned In fact after a week of using them I tossed them in the trash. I saw some with ear buds with a antenna that looked 10 times more comfortable but I guess they dont make them anymore. These suck.
5,gundam,i bought this item recently it shipped pretty quick & arrived fast the figure how ever is smaller than how looks on the picture overall great item
5,Great for reading,"I think some folks are unfair...its exactly what it says A Tribute To Enya, relaxing and soothing...I like it!"
5,Beautiful book!,"I have enjoyed reading this book. The photographs are great, and the history of provence style interesting. This will be a bookI will turn to often for study, and inspiration. Great dealer, fast shipping, and the book was in perfect condition. I would buy from this book seller again. debi"
2,not for me,"This jazz fusion CD didn't work for me. It was just ok. The song ""Breakfast at Denny's"" was pretty good though. Nothing else had an impact. Once the songs were over, I didn't care if I ever heard them again."
1,Buckshot and killed,"This was a pathetic attempt by Branford to try to tie funk, rap, and jazz into one genre. He failed miserably. And when i say failed i mean that this is not good music. Brandford is a great musician, but he was trying to put his stamp on music history and the only footnote he created here was ""worst attempt at perpetual fame"". There are some saving graces on the CD musically but not enough to overcome the attrocities. This CD should be categorized as new age or avante guarde at best. Jazz should never be associated with this CD whatsoever. Some may find this CD refreshing and inovative but I am not one of them. PLEASE listen to the sample tracks before buying this drink coaster of a CD."
1,Gunsmoke The Long Ride,"I ordered this VHS knowing it was used, however it is not good quality as advertised. The movie is complete, but a lot of bad spots in it. I was disappointed. I really would like to see all 5 of the Gunsmoke movies on DVD and in good quality."
1,Not like the originals!,Go for the original Derm Cap!My dog got skin irritation from these! Do not buy them!
1,Piece of junk,"Purchased in Oct 2007. Died in Jan 2009, 90 days after the warranty expired. Sound but no picture. You can see the picture for about three seconds when you first turn on the TV, then it makes a popping sound and the picture disappears.[...]"
3,Airgun Auto Reset Target,This says it is for an airgun but is for a pellet air gun at a minimum. Was misleading as it is recommended with the Red Ryder BB air gun. Would have been a great gift if it went with a pellet gun but a bit disappointment with a BB gun.
4,Fog Juice,The fog juice was fine. It performed exactly as expected and lasts a longer time than I thought. One jug will definitely do you for a while.
1,Happy Balls - Bee Antenna Topper,Don't waste your time - arrived with legs and antenna broken. Wasn't worth the price of sending it back so it became a ball for my cats to play with (minus the remaining legs)
3,Will there be a sequel????,"The story of Miranda's Woke is one of a rich, teenager on a path of nowhere but destruction - - mingling in the NYC fast lane crowd with alcohol, heroin, cocaine, valium....put it this way - - it is easier to name the drugs this girl doesn't do than to list the ones she does - - Parents are divorced and really don't seem to care or support her other than with money...and constantly being mistaken as being see wither her father in this magz and that one, when in reality it is her father and his new wife which is only two years older than Miranda herself..I think this is a great first book for Molly Jong-Fast, but I was left wanting more...maybe a sequel???? The title for this book couldn't have been more perfect since there are more people than we know with substance abuse problems at all ages....so many cases of it that it would make Miranda the ""Normal Girl"" rather than the abnormal girl!!! I'll be on the look out for the next book or sequel (hint, hint!)"
5,very good service but ...,"The book store service is quick and good, but there are still errors in the book even through this is the third edition."
5,This CD is Gangsta!,"Plain and simple, this CD is gangsta. Way better than his G-Unit counterpart, Lloyd Banks. Young Buck is doin it ""live"" too bad he might be ""on vacation"" for a minute battling those stabbing charges. Otherwise pick it up, turn on your bass and ride to this gangster azz CD."
3,"I HATE G-UNIT, BUT I'M FEELIN BUCK",i expected to be dissapointed as usual when i got this album from friend......but on hearing this i was surprised......its a good album.l buck's flow is great. its a good buy . much better than the rest of the g-unit losers
2,"Go Buck, Go Buck",I love this man and his southern flow. It's something about his voice and his hustling tales that draws you into the cd. Although on certain songs he doesn't say much but you still pay attention and understand how they handle their business in Cashville. I love Buck and the his cd and especially his flow. I can't wait for the next G-Unit Cd so him and Banks can wreck ont he cd because there's no stopping them when they're on the same track.
4,Good... But I expected more.,"Proving himself to be the most lyrically deft member of G-Unit on 2003's ""Beg For Mercy,"" Young Buck's debut ""Straight Outta Ca$hville"" is a strong attempt. Although Buck brings his air-tight style on some tracks (""Do It Like Me,"" ""Shorty Wanna Ride,"" ""Bonafide Hustler""), it seems he reserved his illest raps for 50 and Banks. But make no mistake; the beats are grimey as ever, and some of rap's hardest hitters make appearences. Furthermore, you can tell that he's no faker. Buck is the most promising aire to the thug-rap throne, in this post-2pacalyptic wasteland."
1,Bang This...!,"Ok this Album is no bowl of Cheerios. Buck really has missed out on telling the story about all the wonderful southern women, thier smiles and their cooking and their ways. I'm betting that if he didn't spend so much time with his expensive loud toys and gave the ladies ""more attention"" it could happen to him like it happened to me (sorry to borrow a line from Sting) and he'd be too busy having a grand ole time...."
1,No moe muzac foe this jail bird,"Or should I say, prison bird? LOl, not to be blunt, but anyone who tries to take a stab at rap's greatest g-rap producer has anotha thing coming!Plus this CD is boring, the only good song is the stomp track."
4,Straight outta cahsville,"great album dope beats amazing lyrics to much 50 cent would recomend to buy its got sum mean hooks, way better than 50's new album , probably the second best g-unit members album behind the game!"
3,Good product--but cheaper ones are available.,While a good sunscreen lotion there are others available (in larger quantity) for less than $10.00 per bottle rated at SPFs higher than 15. Formulated for men who shave their heads but an SPF of 30 or higher would be preferable.
1,Same ole jokes,"This video contains the same old jokes from his last video. Katt Williams pimped of all with the sell of this dvd which he shot several years ago and it shows. Katt was not as fly as he was in his last video nor was his hair ""luxurious."" This was a complete waste of my money and time. However, if this is your first Katt Williams video, then you will laugh your butt off."
2,same jokes,"I love Kat Williams, but he has the same jokes I've heard many times before, and has used on other dvd's."
2,Crap!,"I did not like this event at all, the matches were short and pretty crap (with an exeption to the Dumpster match) the Austin vs HBK match sucked realey bad, not worth buying,it is kinda like a WCW PPV."
4,above average,good opener with the tag team battle royal. the light heavywheight match is fast forward material. the triple h owen hart match was average. the rock/ shamrock match lacked something. the dumpster match was great. the main event was austin and michals good main event. oh and the undertaker kane match was a bit longer than it should of been but still okay. 50 50 on buying it.
2,A sad disappointment.,"THESE IS MY WORDS is one of my favorite books so I didn't hesitate to rush out and get Nancy Turner's newest book as soon as I heard about it. What a disappointment. This book was terribly difficult to follow. Ideas or plot lines were introduced but never expanded upon or explained until I'd forgotten what they were in the first place. I never got to know the main characters well enough to care much about them. The choices they made in their lives (and WHY) never made sense to me so I kept feeling annoyed instead of empathetic. This book is full of holes. From this reader's perspective, I thought the bare bones were there for a wonderful story, but someone let Ms. Turner down in the editing process."
1,Who's On First- or Who Cares?,"The worst thing about this book is the plot; the second is the lack of character development; and the last worst thing is the purple and predictable prose: ""Hunger and the need for sleep dogged Cpl. Benaly;"" ""My yearning for escape had begun before we came here."" Dead mean ""stretch out like paving stones,"" etc.The plot is so disjointed (not that the changing point of view is difficult to follow) that some ground is covered over and over and other episodes comes without warning. Where does the baby come from before Deely has a baby? The parents have just lived in a boxcar, and suddenly the mother is attending committee meetings of the church social organization. This is an awful book, but I blame it on the editor, or lack of one."
5,My Daily Garlic Dose Without the Smell and Upset Stomach,"Garlic does wonders for one's health in so many ways, but I don't like to deal with the upset stomach that raw garlic produces, nor do I like to announce my presence to others with an offensive odor. This gives me the advantages of garlic without the trouble and smell of fresh garlic. I like it."
1,Not suitable for cats,Product description states it is suitable for cats. It is not. Anything larger than a ferret will need to be leashed and have its head sticking out the top. A cat will not accept this. The seller / manufacturer has misrepresented the product and therefore gets major thumbs down from me.
5,Clicker training at a glimpse,"The illustrations and the short, exact written instructions make it a wonderful handbook both for novices and experienced people who want to clicker train pets."
1,If you need the clicker & treats - why not just treats?,"If you need the clicker & treats - why not just treats?I assumed that the clicker was used for bad behavior, not to reward good behavior. A treat & a good boy is enough for our dogs for good behavior. I need to turn the bad behavior around. Sorry I bought this product."
4,Calculating God - a good read,"Robert Sawyer is a wonderful writer. He was able to offer the reader a coherent dialogue regarding the existance of God being a scientific fact through interaction between human and alien characters. All of his characters were built with humor, depth and a feeling of reality. The only part I didn't like was a distracting sub-plot regarding militant creationists. But, the merits of the rest of the book far overpowered this problem. The argument for God was fresh because it did not involve religion. It was a pure question of whether a God existed whose purpose seemed to be keeping order in the universe. The question of morality as a path to immortality was brought up but scientifically disregarded. In summary, I like this book very much and will order another by Robert Sawyer."
4,Likeable SciFi,"Entertaining, thought provoking SciFi, with some laughs along the way, good ploting, great charactors and accessable to mainstream readers. Sawyer is one of the better SciFi writers and deserves your attention, tho I'd recommend starting with ""Mindscan"" which I like a whole lot more. :)"
3,Interesting but off-balance,"The characters in 'Calculating God' are the best part of the book. All scenes involving Jericho (the human) and Hollus (the alien) are well written and very interesting. In fact all chapters revolving around the alien cultures were interesting and at some points mind-expanding.The plot as a whole, however, seemed off-balance and ill-planned. Plot devices seem to come flying out of left-field with little or no build-up ... particularly the last five-or-so chapters. If you can get over that and you don't mind being manipulated a little, you will enjoy this book for the characters."
3,Bad Science,"This book stopped me cold pretty early on. Sawyer is attempting to use facts from science to support the theory that God is a real being. Yet he throws in the 'fact' that dogs and wolves can not produce fertile offspring to help support this theory. The problem is that they certainly do mate and produce fertile offspring. So do all of other various dog types (coyotes, wolves, dogs...they all mate and produce hybrids that are fertile). This could have been an interesting book if he had done a bit more research into his 'facts'. Such glaring errors make it difficult to invest any emotion in his plot or characters. I understand that this is fiction...that doesn't excuse the author from twisting the truth to fit his own agenda and still presenting it as fact."
5,This is a great watch!,"I bought one of these as a gift for my husband who is keen on astronomy. The special tin it comes in makes it look extra special. I've uploaded a photo to show what it looks like in the tin. This is the ultimate gift for the astronomy geek male.""The watch has a mini planisphere on the dial! Showing the contellations visible in the Northern Hemisphere (between 35 - 50 deg. lat.). Quality construction includes a durable brass case, crystal dome lens, a unique and extremely comfortable rubber/steel bracelet (that is a snap to adjust and fits any wrist), Japan movement and Swiss ""Super Luminescent"" dial that glows for 2-3 hours!. Makes a great gift for anyone interested in astronomy. Colors: Silver metal with black wristband Comes in a metal gift box."""
2,"Cute, but work poorly","Everyone else with low ratings has said it well... eye candy, hard to fill, hard to get enough out, etc... it's a pitiful product. Our salt one jammed and we could not fix it. The pepper one is hard to use. We gave them a try, but alas, they are worthless. Please don't waste your money."
5,if you want good price for the best quality!!this is your choice!!,"FOR THIS PRICE YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING BETTER!! THE SILVER IN THIS CABKLE GIVES YOU THE BEST QUALITY, YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY MORE, THIS CHOICE IS YOUR BEST CHANCE TO UPGRADE YOU TV AND HOMETHEATER SYSTEM!! SO GO FOR IT!!!"
4,I liked this book,"I agree with the critics who have said Natalie Goldberg reveals herself as neurotic, self absorbed, immature and selfish in this memoir. No doubt about it. You can't argue with that analysis. I have also noticed that I am neurotic, self absorbed, immature and selfish. Come to think of it, everyone I know is to some degree neurotic, self absorbed, immature and selfish. This seems to be the human condition. It is fun to read about hero's but it is also good to read about real people. This a book about a real person. Goldberg tells a good honest story of her relationships with two important men in her life. It is a good book. I recommend it."
2,Waste of Time & Money,"Not eveyone who is an M.D., Ph.D. can write or has something interesting or groundbreaking to say.The cover of this book, with its ultrasound picture of a fetus, and the ""AS SEEN ON THE TODAY SHOW"", look interesting and makes the book look worth reading. But these are only a selling points.This is a painfully repetative 212 page book that could have been written in no more than 20 pages. The author repeats himself page after page. He writes non-releavant stories about how researcher did some studies and came to some conclusions.Everything in this book is common knowledge and common sense: eat healthy, don't over-eat or under-eat, don't drink, don't smoke, stay away from toxins and other chemical, take folic acid, and visit the OBGYN regularly."
2,Great size but not great coating,"I've had this pan for 6 years and I love the size of it but like many other reviewers have said, the non-stick coating started peeling and flaking very early. Mine is so bad I have to throw it away which pains me. The lady at the Le Crecet store told me I probably have cooked at too high a temperature on it which made it peel.Who knew? I recommend that Le Creucet stick to enamal coating which is great."
1,More dogma,"I work as a correctional educator. I agree that some hard-core types fit Samenow's descriptors, but for every one of the hard cases there are 10 inmates that can be rehabilitated by education, counseling and good community support. I know. I have seen it happen. Samenow's assertion that all that is accomplished by educating an inmate is to make a smarter criminal goes against volumes of research that conclude the opposite. The little research that Samenow does choose to mentioned seems carefully picked to agree with his dogma. His insulting diatribe against the work of those hard-working souls who labor in prisons to help rehabilitate inmates is both incorrect and unfair."
3,Decent Book Overall,Inside the Criminal Mind offers a very good introduction into the reasoning behind criminal psychological perspectives and recidivism.
5,primer,"This book is a great primer for living in a world full of criminals, but also for studying history (a la bought Amazon history books). Samenow shows, via compelling evidence garnered from years of personal study and observation, how there is no out of character crime. Basically, if they did it, they were always capable of doing it. Even if one doesn't agree with Samenow's conclusions, this book is a great tool to get the mind pondering. Also, at the end of the newer version is a helpful way to ""attack"" and overcome criminal thinking, addiction-behavior, etc."
1,Backwards,"I read this book fifteen or so years ago. The author was on the staff of Regan. It exhibits this.It is a complete distortion. For one thing, it doesnot make a distinction,in explaining crime and poverty, of the what and how of causes. Like a combination lock, a series of causes(the number sequence) can open ornot the lock of criminal behavior. Poverty is a seriesof experiences that can come at one differently. The 'fact' of poverty can happen differently for differentpersons, thus leading to crime. The author of this book ignores that a series of experiences(causes)canbe different."
4,Princess Clock,"I purchased this clock for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the clock - the face is pretty large, with the princesses just as shown. -1 star for the following: 1) there was no protection between the clock face and the box so there are some rub marks on the clear plastic (they don't affect the readability or the overall look of the clock) and 2) the numbers on the face are a bit hard to see due to their size and color (they are rather small and don't contrast with the pink of the face as much as I had hoped they would). Overall, good value for the money and very impressed with the shipping (it was shipped via USPS and arrived about 3 days after I ordered it, in plenty of time for Christmas)."
1,Timberland is pure junk!,"I bought a shirt just like this from Timberland and will NEVER buy from them again. I wore it one time and washed it in cold water on gentle cycle, drying it on delicate (very low heat). The shirt shrunk more than two sizes and was no longer wearable. I returned it at my expense, as I had done nothing wrong and the shirt was now useless to me. Timberland returned the shirt to me with a form letter stating that their ""inspection revealed that the item had been worn,"" duh. Of course I had explained all of this. Not only is their clothing of very poor quality, their customer service is even worse!!"
3,"Needs a little work, but great idea","A great idea, but when shot at over a period of time it tends to break down. It doesn't always tend to reset as it should. It's a great idea, but doesn't always work as expected."
3,"Fun, but nothing special...","It's a cool little target, I enjoy it, and other people at the range enjoy it too.However, it is cheaply made. I shot out one of the pins/rivets that holds one of the targets in place, I had to replace it with a bent nail. Secondly, you may hit a target, but sometimes (20% or so) it will go all the way up and come back down. Also, I don't like the color of the target, I wish it was more of a blaze orange because I'm colorblind and having a red target on a green background is tough for me. Nothing some spray paint can't fix though.I would consider buying another one considering they're cheap. But you get what you pay for."
3,"""meh"" scent","great shampoo- very thin for a concentrate, and not a whiff of almond scent, but leaves my hair very clean and soft"
2,You only get 1 - not 2.,"Looking at the picture for this product, I thought I was getting something that would prevent my baby from falling from both sides - you only get one of them."
1,Not for restless sleepers!!!!,"I am very disappointed in the product. It did not help keep my two year old stay in the bed because the elastic that holds it to the bed easily slides off. He fell out of bed during the night and got tangeled up in the whole thing.In fact,when checking on him frequently after he fell out, he kept getting tangled up in it! I suppose if your child does not move when he's sleeping, this might work, but for the money....don't waste it."
4,great for toddler day bed,"i was on the fence about this item, but decided to try it. It works great for our toddlers crib-turned-daybed. She used to fall out every nap and every night, but this small bolster type rail works wonderful. I can see how it would not work so good on a larger bed but we love it!"
3,Lacks Pronunciation Guide,"I purchased this book for a summer internship in France. It is comprehensive in topics and vocabulary, but has no pronunciation guides. French is a language that is not phonetic. I would recommend getting something with a CD/DVD or at least a guide. I had good luck withFrench, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)which is great to listen to in the car!"
3,"Hanes Classics Tall Men's Crewneck T Shirts 2-Pack, White, Large","Wish they made it in Medium. It does get bacon neck stretch after a while, despite adds to contrary. Not impressed, but need Tall Men's tee so they stay tucked in. Nothing is more uncomfortable than when the tee shirt moves up above the waistline inside the dress shirt. <<<Hanes - You listening?"
3,SIZE IS HUGE,"SO the shirts are fine, besides being a bit expensive but the problem is a large runs about the same as others XL. SO now I have huge sleeping shirts. Awesome."
1,Different then in the past...,"These shirts used to be fantastic...long, pre shrunk.I have ordered them 3 times.This time, they shrunk. Way too short. Poor job reducing the quality."
5,Hanes Tall Crewnecks a super find!,"Very happy with this purchase! These T-shirts are just long enough, super soft and wash and dry well. We have spent all this money over the years on very expensive t-shirts from department stores that are not as nice as these!! 5 Stars!!!"
3,Needs to be bigger,"By looking at the picture, I thought this was bigger than what it really is. It has great quality, but is too little. have to shoot low and always aim at the ground. other than the size, it is a good buy."
4,"Good, but not very big","My only disappointment is that it is smaller than I expected - other than that, I like it a lot."
3,Its Functional,"The spinner target doesn't have the yellow bullseyes as shown in the photo, and the metal frame is a little weak, but it does the job."
4,Review From A 13 year old,"I think this game is great, the more people you have the more fun it is? if you play it to many times though it can get a little boring. in this game you laugh alot, it really is for 12 and up though it would be pretty hard to understand and get the funniness of it anyways almost every time i play i enjoy it."
4,Jaw Breakers & Heart Thumpers,I read this book and its good. I dont usually get into those kind of books though the title is deciving because it has nothing to do with the story.
2,DVD had a glitch during the best part of the movie.,It skipped forward and wouldn't play. Disappointed. Bought to give as a gift and wish I had previewed it before I did.
3,BUY ONLY IF YOU DONT HAVE PART 1,"I SOOOOOOOOOO LOVED THE GATHERING PART 1 . NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE EXCELLENT ACTING HOWEVER THE SOUNDTRACK WORK VERY WELL AND THE ENDING WAS PERFECT .......NOW , WHY WOULD THEY RUIN IT WITH THAT GARBAGE THEY CALL PART TWO . MOST OF THE CAST IS BACK HOWEVEVER ITS LIKE THEY LEFT THEIR ACTING TALENTS IN PART 1 AND THE MUSIC IS HORRIBLE ....BUY ONLY IF YOU DONT HAVE THE PART 1 WHICH IS A GEM , HOWEVER IF YOU BUY IT , DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND THROW PT TWO IN THE TRASH"
4,This was a gift,"I bought this for my mom and dad as a gift. They said they loved it and that it was a great story, especially for Christmas time."
4,Excellent TV Movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie again. It reminds me of this higher quality television movies that I remember from my childhood. I first saw this movie ten or fifteen years ago and was extremely happy to find that Amazon had it. The movie's theme about how one should not take one's family for granted in order to concentrate on business or other things is one that never gets old. We all need to be reminded of this message. In addition, Ed Asner's performance was awesome as it usually is."
3,So-so movie,"I have seen this movie 2 times, the first time when it first came out. Ed Asner is superb. It is very melancholy befitting the Christmas season for some people. Slow-moving and predictable would explain it also. It was fun being a member of the chorus when it was made at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio."
5,Worth The Wait!,I've waited over 30 years to finally get this movie on DVD. And watching it now was just as wonderful as when I first saw it on TV 32 years ago. Everything about it was perfect especially the acting. I felt like I was looking in the window of a real-life family. A 5 star rating for sure.
3,"Good, but needs improvement","Great book to own for all military history/art enthusiasts. However, the black & white photos of the uniforms and equipment STINK, and take away from the beauty of the book. The entire book should DEFINATELY be in color, considering it was published at $55 retail."
3,review,i read the bok and it was good but there was a bunch of things that were wrong. all around the book was decent but i know for a fact that some of the information was inaccurate and i know for a fact because one of the people talked about in the book in my grandfather
3,Bobby Breen DVD from Grapevine nothing to brag about...,"The quality of this DVD-R is probably on the same level as Alpha's and other low-end public domain companies. Not great, and even borderline unacceptable at times. But, unless Warner Archives decides to release the original RKO vault prints of Breen's films, or Breen's own entertainment business in Florida produces better film elements, I'm afraid this DVD will have to do -- if you are a Bobby Breen fan, that is.Com'on, Warner Archive -- cough 'em up!"
5,I know Rob from the Rug Burns,Rob Driscoll is the raddest guy and so is his CD. How do I know this you might ask? He's my Honors English teacher for the 10th grade. So take my advice and buy that CD!
1,Failed After 6 Months,"It has everything I wanted in a low cost function generator. It's just too bad that it doesn't work as advertised. My first big issue with it is that it fails to deliver the maximum rated voltage of 10 V into a matched source. In fact it often barely makes it to 5 V (10 V peak to peak).The second big problem is that sometimes it fails to boot up properly. The LCD just goes dim and it goes into some unknown state. I won't bother sending this back. I'm just going to throw it out. Can anyone recommend a low cost signal generator that's reliable, delivers 20 V peak to peak? It needs to be able to generate low frequencies reliably as well, down to 4 Hz."
4,Series is getting better,"I'll admit that while I did not completely like Permed to Death, Hair Raiser's predecessor, I did not hate it, either. While I found the characterization a bit awkward and certain sub-plots of the story predictable, I thought Cohen had a nice concept with Marla Shore and hope she could pull off an improved sequel. I'm happy to say Hair Raiser is evidence that Cohen is getting better at the mystery game.The mystery -- where Marla is determined to hunt the killer of a lawyer on the board of an environmental committee which includes her cousin -- is thought out and written well. Plus the relationship between Marla and Detective Vail makes for great page-turning sexual tension -- their relationship does not come off as awkward as it did in the first book. I can genuinely say I'm looking forward to reading more."
3,dissapointing,Not the scent I remember and loved 25 years ago.My mistake for not testing it in person before buying online.
5,Thank God there are still good christian stuff for kids,"I purchase the DVD by Max Lucado ""Hermie the Caterpillar"" and now ""You are mine"" for my daughter. I am so happy that the there are good shows with values for kids. It is so sad to see so many violence on children's cartoons and shows these days. How can children know how to love, care and respect themselves without the simple values. Thanks to you Max Lucado for being that light in the darkness for all kids."
3,Good for old PCs,"USB support is spotty, but otherwise quite usuable for PC's that don't need to be on the internet."
5,All Praises for Cecil Street!,"Diane McKinney-Whetstone does an incredible job of weaving the lives and stories of folks on Cecil Street. A masterful storyteller can be found in her previous works, Tumbling and Blues Dancing, Diane manages to showcase her storytelling talents again by taking her readers on several journeys at once, through the perspectives of her major characters Louise, Joe, Alberta, Shay and Neet.Again, All Praises for Cecil Street!Trinice Speight-MosesSisters with a Purpose Bookclub - New Jersey"
3,Sponge Bob Christmas DVD,Typical Sponge Bob DVD. There is only one (1) Christmas movie on here about 28 minutes long and the rest are just ordinary Sponge Bob movies. Expected them to all be Christmas theme.
4,Concave Expansion Plugs,"Just what I was looking for but could not find locally up here in Anchorage, Alaska. A great product that arrived in a timely fashion."
2,Don't let the name get you!,"I bought a Fuji 3 pack gave one or two away; went by the name because they specialize in film. Save your money folks, if your need quality. Surprizingly, I got a VHS Video ""Pro High Grade Vedeocassette Tape"" on sale at Radio Shack.That correct Radio Shack. It's as clear if not better as my TDK Ultimate Quality tapes."
2,Dissapointing,"I was very excited to get this book and went out and bought it the first chance i got. I have to say though, after reading it i am very dissapointed. This book is nothing like the first all american girl novel. It has hardly the witty dialouge or humor. This book is mainly about only one thing. And that's whether she's ""Ready or Not"". In my opinion it's not worth reading.This book is definatly not up to her usual standards. I still love Meg Cabot, but i wouldn't recamend this book. If you're expecting something like her other books, prepare to be dissapointed."
1,Do not buy this trash,"Over 200 pages of ""I'm a 16 year old girl, my boyfriend is hot, I think I want sex, no I don't, well he does, oops he doesn't want to, it was all in my head, I show him the birth control, so we have sex, it was fun."" There, dear readers, is the great prose of Ms. Cabot. Amazing, for someone who claims to enjoy Dickens. He would be appalled at this tripe."
2,A bit of a letdown.,"The first book in this series is clever, funny, and a good light read.This one, however, failed to deliver. I'm not giving anything away, but literally the entire book just revolves around sex. And after a while, frankly, it gets quite boring. The characters, Lucy especially, are inconsistent, and overall I'd have to say this book could've stood a few more rounds through the editing process.It's still got a few good plot points and the main struggle of the story was a well-thought out idea, even if drawn out."
5,the best songsmith ever,"My musical tastes have changed alot over the years but I have always apreciated great songs. You could spend a fortune and not have a better compilation of songs than this two cd set. This is early Lightfoot,with bare recording techniques that strip away the layers of pop overproduction and leave just a Man and his wonderful music. Lightfoot was obviously younger here and his songs reflect that. from lost loves to social injustice, boredom and restlessness, Lightfoots songwriting skills combined with beautiful guitar work and his rich baritone create a listening experience I have never equalled on any cd. Just listen. What a treasure, and what an underappreciated musical talent."
5,Solar Oil for Nails,I love the rich feeling and wonderful smell of this product and what it does for my finger nails. It is wonderful!
1,Very Confusing!!!!!!!!,"This book is very confusing, perhaps Franklin should stop writing books and attend a few writting classes. Franklin repeats facts 2 or 3 times in different chapters and often sets off on wild tangents the can leave the reader utterly befuddled. The only reason I gave this book 1 star is due to Franklins fair treatment of the reconstruction period. Franklin places the blame for the mistakes and horrors of the post civil war era on both Northern and Southern forces; however, due to the utterly incompetent writing of franklin, I can not recomend this book."
5,Made me cry!,I watched this movie the other day and cried. It's hard enough for kids to enter high school but when they stick out for some reason it's even harder. I just fell in love with Jimmy and his drive to make things better for himself. I loved this movie!!
3,Slightly Off Track,"I love the Deborah Knott mystery series and have read all of them. The first three chapters of Storm Track, though, are slow and disjointed. By page fifty, the pace picks up and the Ms. Maron's usually solid writing begins to kick in again. I enjoyed reading this book, but I'd be happier if I had paid for a paperback copy instead. The hardcover is only 260 pages long and the print is large. I hope the forecast for her next book is sunnier."
2,Disappointing Denouement,"I found this book abandoned in the departure area of an airport and picked it up. I have never read any of Maron's book and had a few hours to kill, so I gave it a whirl. I had a hard time getting into the story at first, most likely due to the fact that I was unfamiliar with any of the characters. I was eventually sucked into the plot, and I soon found myself rushing to find out who done it. The denouement left me totally unfulfilled, which is a great shame. Far too many questions are left unanswered. How did the killer know she would be registered at that hotel under that name? Was the crime premeditated? Who was she going to meet that evening? Without giving away the ending, I don't want to ask more questions in this forum. Suffice it say there are many more unanswered questions. A story that builds in excitement with the strength of the approaching hurricane, the ending provides the reader with no more than a puff of air from a far-off ceiling fan! Boo. Hiss."
5,1985 Honda CB650,I have used this book extensively to repair and maintain my Honda. It provides all the pertinent information needed and has many diagrams and pictures to help with complex procedures. The toughest one I did was replacing the ignition switch... which was a lot bigger chore than I had first imagined. But with the help of this book I was able to successfully replace the switch. For those reasons I give this book a big thumbs up... (not to mention I don't know of any other books out there for an 85 Honda CB650).
3,Hooded Sweatshirt,"The service was fantastic, I am delighted with how quickly my package arrived. The quality of the sweatshirt is very good, we are very pleased with the item, except for one thing. I ordered it for my daughter, and she loves it, but would have liked a smaller size and the company includes absolutely no instructions for returning or exchanging the item, so this will probably prevent me from ordering from them again."
1,HUGE rip-off,Do not waste your time on this. The article is limited in description and they do not even include the pictures! This is the first time I have ever felt ripped off by Amazon. This was a total waste of money and time. I am not even going to bother saving the download. The stupid article cost more than the orginal magazine.
4,Works great you always know where you are,I purchased this for $199 at on of the large computer stores. I was not listed on here at the time. The thing works great but eats batteries. Go to the manufactures site after you buy it and order the power adapter for the thing for $29.00 or get both adapters for $39.00 that's what I did. I travel alot and use it everyday. Takes me to the middle of nowhere turn by turn and does not miss.
1,UUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!,"THIS MOVIE JUST PLAIN OLD (...). I could have gotten better entertainment from Sorority Babes at the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama!The only thing appealing is the sister is HOT! WHY DOES THIS CREATURE WHISTLE? The plot was original, I'll give them that. But they should have kept this movie in its original form...... an idea in someones head!"
2,Jeepers Creepers Just Can't Creep Enough,"I just saw Jeepers Creepers for the first time and what started out as a pretty suspense filled road movie ended up as typical schlock. I liked how this movie started with a brother and sister riding home and wind up being terrorized by a nut in a truck. This movie really had my attention through the first 45 minutes or so.The best scenes involved the discovery in the drainpipe and the scene with the police car. But once the movie came to the police station, it started irritating me. For one thing, I could not stand the pyschic woman actually announcing when the scare scenes would actually happen. Then there is the issue involving that ridiculous song. How cliche is that now? But what ticked me off was the movie's ending.(Or non-ending as it were). Obviously, it was to set up the inevitable sequel. It got off to a good start, but Jeepers Creepers ultimatly crashes into a wall of cliches."
2,From thrilling to ...,"Why is everyone rating this 5 stars?The film started out brilliantly, and though I'm usually jaded with movies like this I was truly SCARED during the first half hour. Just from the abandoned church scene and ""psycho truck"" scene I felt like I got my money's worth (maybe) and the overall rating would then be 3 stars if it DIDN'T DETERIORATE INTO MINDLESS ... and an ending that was so ridiculous and insulting to the audience that no one even groaned--everyone had sort of a confused look, not wanting to believe the movie treated them as it, unfortunately, did. Pretty good acting and a a suspenseful intro aren't capable of redeeming this slop."
1,Jeepers!! What a (bad) Movie,"This movie, apart from the brief opening sequence, is lame. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this stinker."
4,"jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes","from the horrifying beginning to the horrifying end, this movie is purely a adrenaline pumping ride, fueled with a believeable creature and a good cast, but that crazy lady who sees visions seems a little miscast and annoying some times. favorite part has got to be the ending. followed by a sequel 2 years later"
2,Just jeepers,"Well, sorry to disagree with everyone else, but this movie just lacked a certain something. I gave this movie two stars because it started out really good-nice and creepy, but kind of lost its momentum as the movie went on. I became bored and was just hoping it would hurry up and end. There was little detail on the origin of the creeper and not enough character development to make one care what happened to the characters. My advice to eager movie goers: go see Ghosts of Mars and The Others in the theatre and wait until Jeepers Creepers comes out on video."
2,With your brains off...,"This is sheer enjoyment if you watch it with your brains in the ""off"" position. Even for the horror genre, there are actual plot holes as big as the hole where the Demon beast hide the bodies of its victims!!!!Other than this, there's no way for you not like the first half of the movie, where we are introduced to the brothers, the beast and a few of its preys. THen things get a little bit out of the hand with the history, bnut the overall result is a very satisfactory horror movie."
4,"Unsettling, original horror","I've been a fan of horror films for over 30 years and this is one of the best I've seen in recent years. I found it to be extremely unsettling and the movie stayed with me some time after watching it, which is a good sign that the film succeeded in creeping me out! The only other films I've seen in recent years that affected me the same way were The Blair Witch Project and the original Japanese version of The Ring. I'm heartily sick of derivative slasher flicks cast with teens/20somethings that are boringly predictable, like Valentine, Urban Legends and the latest Halloween and Friday The 13th sequels, so this one was like a breath of fresh air to a jaded horror fan.The DVD is great. The special features are well selected and informative which is why I imported this one from the US. The Region 4 version contains no special features at all, so this version is definitely the one to own if you're interested in behind-the-scenes stuff."
1,Worst Movie Ever,just the first fifteen mins will put you to sleepthis movie is stupid and insulting to filmmakers everywhereand it isn't worth the plastic that the dvd is made of
3,so mutch potential.....wasted,Jeepers Creepers gets an A for origionality. I liked the fact that I hadnt seen this plot before recycled from another film. I also liked the monster. He was a real bad ... But that is where the train gets de-railed. The film was just porely executed. And the main characters were hands down THE DUMBEST KIDS IN HORROR FILM HISTORY. They do EVERYTHING a sane person wouldnt do. I was insulted at the stupidity of these ...Now we get to the ending of the film. I wont spoil it for anyone who wants to see it but...........WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED????? Jeepers Creepers has the strangest ending of all time. It boggles the mind.
5,Excellent horror thriller.,"Jeepers Creepers is a horror thriller in the vein of 80's ""old school"" style, which means it relies on atmosphere over a hip soundtrack (which it doesn't have, at all) and the teen cast from Dawson's Creek. Rather, we get two unknown actors to play the part, a genuinely intense score, and some truly effective camerawork and stylishness to build suspense. There's a decent amount of gore, too, for those interested.The two leads are very good, playing off each other very believably as a brother/sister duo who truly care for one another. The film moves at a fast pace, and its knockout finale breaks some genre cliches. The final scene might not go well with some, but it's a shocking close to a terrific frightfest."
2,Great Idea!!! - Weak Ending!!!,"This movie started out great. It was edge of your seat scary with this nameless, faceless person terroizing these kids and no one is around to help them. It even keeps up the fear level when they confront this person.... And then it falls apart! The end, when this person is revealed, is such a let down that you just kind of say,""Well that was stupid"". Even my ten year old who was experiencing her first scary movie thought it was dumb. If they could have thought of a more original ending instead of the cookie cutter it was, it would have been worthy of 5 stars. So rent it don't buy it and enjoy the first two thirds."
4,Wow!,"This is a really unique movie with a story that I had never seen before, so it is a rather memorable film for me. I've seen enough horror movies that some of them tend to just run together, but this movie is definitely not one of them... the story really stuck in my mind, years after seeing the movie. Oh god, there were so many pulse-pounding moments where I would be on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what happens next! Definitely worth a movie checking out!"
5,One of the most original creatures in decades!,"This one has it all! It's Ed Gein meets Hitchcock meets Gargoyles. I can't say enough about this fantastic movie. I have turned so many friends onto this flick and they can never get enough. I really can't wait for it to see a proper blu-ray release. The second installment isn't as good, but still worth while if you dig the first one. This isn't your average teen slasher flick, this is a real thriller.Creature fans may also like to know there is currently a prequal in the works telling of the monster's origin. Anybody that ties a classic creature with an old time, jazzy standard is brilliant in my book! One of my all-time favorites!"
4,Better ending PLEASE,Come on. The movie was great and the plot was excellent but the ending (...) blew. There was no ending. The company will make a lot of mone off this movie becasue they have to have a sequal so everyone who saw it the first time will crawl back to the theatre wanting to know what happen next. Other than that the movie was spectacular.
1,I want the 2 hours of my life back that i spent watching this HORRIBLE movie!,Words almost can not describe how BAD this movie was. It was ok and scary up until the point that they showed the monster or thing and then it became cheesy. i mean wow DONT NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE. Seems like it was written and directed by a [...] 12yr old. Some parts are disturbing at best. but it was very very predictable and insanely cheesy. I got angry really angry watching this movie the sister was a bitch and the old black woman should have died. The acting was amateur hour. Horrible acting 101. i really wish i could get the 2 hours back that i spent watching this movie. DONT NOT WATCH THIS CHEESY STUPID MOVIE. Im embarrassed to have even watched it and write about it but i feel the general public should know how bad its is and to destroy every copy you see. if you like this movie then your even more [...] up in the head than the people who made it! it deserves 0 stars but thats not an option.
5,The Jeepers Creepers Cult Classic,"Being a horror and suspense fan, the Jeepers Creepers movie is the best of the modern horror phenomena, using psichology to induce horror in a great way and an oustanding sound, you really enjoy this thriller. For this movie I give a thumbs up and congrats for the filmakers."
1,Half baked,"Could have been a lot better, the flick led us one way, then delivered in another. Way too predictable, went from entertaining to insultingly dumb. Give it a look, but not for your collection."
1,"Horrible, predictable, dissapointing to say the least","I don't understand anybody liking or being scared by this movie! I'll say this: The first 10 minutes looked like the movie was going to be scarier than ""Silence of the Lambs"".....I was psyched. Then the movie went downhill, and became just plain stupid.You know you have watched a bad movie when it ends so abruptly that you sit shaking your head in disbelief as you watch the credits roll."
4,A great 45 minute movie lies within...,"After being subjected to post-modern horror for years, where movies were afraid to just be scary without winking at the audience, we have here, ladies and gentlemen, the scariest 45 minutes of film to come along in AGES.The first half of this movie is so full of dread. Superbly done. The rest of the movie...eh. Once we see the creature, it kinda falls apart. But I forgive them...especially since the last 10 seconds made my stomach drop.Again I shake my head in disbelief at people who toss this movie aside. Probably same folks who poo-pooed ""Suspiria"" and ""Blair Witch""...just WHAT do they define as ""scary""???"
1,All you want is for the monster to just off the main people,Jeepers Creepers why'd I pay to see this movie?!! This movie could have been so much better. The only good thing about it is its short running time (only an hour and a half). I realize characters in scary movies are supposed to do stupid things but these people just did way too many stupid things especially the character Trish. For the majority of the movie I was just wishing that the monster would just off her because she was just a tad bit too annoying. The monster is going after Trish and Darry because it wants one of them yet numerous times throughout the movie when it had ample opportunity to get them it for some unknown reason decides instead to kill other people. If you were to cut all the unnecessary parts from this movie it would probably be a quite satisfying 15 minute short film.
3,Scary - til the end which is lame...,"This film scared me to death - until you find out that the 'psycho killer bad guy' is actually a stupid, totally unbelievable demon type thing...Literally was on a path to being a really scary, wicked movie - but you can't be scared of something that doesn't actually exist!Enjoyable all the same!"
2,What happened to good horror movis?,"I bought this movie thinking that it might be good. Boy was I wrong. I was amazed that every turn the characters would do exactly what I thought they would and in such a stupid fashion it wasn't even funny. That is the problem with new horror movies. They have absolutely no plot and no fun or spunk to them. What happened to the good ole classic 80's horror movie that was cheesy and dumb but smart? And you knew that it was going to be cheesy and dumb, but it was cool and smart anyway. I think that the movie industry needs to rethink their whole attitude toward these new movies that they are making. NO ONE LIKES THE FORMAT!! The sooner that movie producers figure this out the better. I gave it two stars one because I couldn't give it any less, and one because the special effects were fair."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I learned my lesson and will no longer buy DVD's basedon reviews likely put out by the filmaker themselves.This movie was predictible, short, and left you hangingat the end. It seemed to end before it started. The ""monster""was a joke. The characters were all poor actors. The stupid""Jeepers Creepers"" song made no sense to me and was only a tieto the final scene.Stay away from this movie. If you want frights watch ""What liesbeneath"" with the lights out.The producer should save his money and not make the sequel tothis trash."
3,Jeepers Creepers......,"This movie is pretty good. Two teens are on their way home on an isolated country road when almost run off the road by an old beat up, yet cool, truck. Thinking they have seen the last of this truck and the crazy person driving it, they continue on their journey only to pass in front of an old church where they see the same beat up truck and someone who seems to be throwing a body down a large sewer pipe. They decide to investigate and when one of them falls down the sewer pipe, he discovers a den of horror. Now being seen by the killer, they must run for their lives. This movie delivers in both horror and gore. Not a boring movie and well acted. I recommend any horror movie fan at least rent this movie if you have not seen it yet."
2,A great start but a pitiful finish.,"All the reviews I read about this movie talked about the ""incredible beginning"" and the ""fresh take on the genre."" Sadly, this movie was a major disappointment. Yes, the movie seemed from the start to be worth the time. Fifteen minutes into it, though, the whole room of us watching started our catcalls to the screen. ""What the heck?"" ""Oh, that is SO stupid."" ""Oh man, that is pathetic."" And it only got worse from there.Despite some truly startling moments, the movie itself descends into silly and laugh out loud scenes. By the end - yes, we forced ourselves to watch it all - we were all checking the bottom of the screen to see if the guys from Mystery Science Theater were watching with us. After an hour and a half of silly, you won't care what happens to anyone in the film."
2,Did not work for me,It did not work comparing for me. I tried - I failed. Will not recommend to buy. Even though it is cheaper.
2,Not as good as other options,"Good looking, but rather inconvenient design that takes longer to access the cards. I switched to using the hakuba cases which in my opinion is so much better. The hakuba cases are more compact, and provide a much faster access to the cards."
1,Don't bother !,"If you are a cellular operator or work for any manufacturing company in the industry, don't bother to buy this book. It lacks the practical view required when deploying cellular systems"
4,PE beginnings...,"This reprint of Drew Hayes' oringinal Mulehide Graphics Poison Elves series is quite well done. While those who are only familiar with his later works would see the trade paper back as crude and not well practiced, others will definately relish in all the history it has to offer. The later comics do hint at what is contained in the earlier issues, but it is best to read it here and get all the details in full black and white. Further, it is always enjoyable to see where a favorite comic started and how it has evolved to what it is today. That is probablly what makes this book most enjoyable."
4,Easy Intro to Schopenhauer,"Despite the lack of a bibliolography, this brief book explores Schopenhauer's main thoughts on Will and Aesthetics. The writing is crisp and easily understood. The many quotations from the philosopher's main work are clear, inspiring me to read Schopenhauer directly.Dr. Tanner introduces Shopenhauer by way of Kant, and in my opinion gives a clear and relevant account. He contrasts Schopenhauer with Nietzsche, who first adopted his predecessor's thoughts, but who later overcame the apparent pessimism of Schopenhauer with his own Uebermensch."
4,Lowepro Vertex 100 AW Backpack,"This product is a quality backpack, typical from Lowepro. However, if you have more than 3 extra lenses to carry, and a flash, you may want to consider the 200 AW, since the 100 is a bit small inside."
5,Inner Circle,I really do not understand why there is no DVD version of this brilliant movie. We have the chance to have many trash movies transformed into DVD or even Bru-Rays formats but not this masterpiece. What a pity..
1,"Less than an overview, 1 star charitable","I had expected a somewhat detailed review of the battle. I knew there was little if any actual footage available. But, very detailed accounts of each of the outpost battles in all of their phases exist (Hell In a Small Place). I was dissappointed not only is the coverage of the actual Battle minimal, none of the main personalities such as Bigeard, Langlais etc. are covered. The issue of promised or implied American support is not even mentioned. The murder of over 70% of the French Expeditionary Force POWs is not mentioned either. I could go on. To add insult to injury the file footage that is used is totally invonsistant i.e. heavy mechanized attacks by the French when they had only Five 'Bison' Tanks I would truly like to find a good, thorough, Video of this pivotal battle where the dye was cast for the next 20+ years!"
1,review center fold ramp,"The ramp is ok, but I was a bit surprised that only 1 ramp was delivered. The picture shows clearly how I want to use it. I believed it was a set for that price."
1,Looks like a scam to me!,"When you sell a ramp where the picture show 2 ramps, you need to include 2 ramps or make sure in the description it says ONLY ONE RAMP INCLUDED!!! Would have made the same mistake as the rest if I haven't read the complaints. The seller is trying to confuse the buyers into paying twice the price as the auction site people use!!! As for the quality of the ramps, I will pass on this 'DEAL' and go elsewhere :0)"
5,Great Purchase!,"Love these knives so much, I bought a set for my mother and a set for my mother in law!"
5,Rachel Does it Again !!!,"I finally found the perfect deal! They were a FREE gift along with my R Ray pan set! Can't be free! However, when I got them, I realized just how great they are, and I would not have been upset if I'd had to pay for them! The wooden box is SO nice & sturdy, you won't be throwing it away. Initially I thought I'd only be really using the larger knife, but I find myself grabbing the small knife instead of a paring knife many times. The silicone handles make for very safe use! You won't worry about it slipping out of your hands. . I absolutely love it! I highly recommend it to anyone who cooks. Her products shows you y Rachel is one of the Top Chefs . Excellent knife set, you'll love it."
2,Ambesaw,"of course, calculus with analytic geometry was delivered on time and it was packed properly.however, the external cover of the book is exchanged. I mean that the front cover is on the back and vice versa. The book was damaged more than i expected."
1,"The most useless, unhelpful, poorly written math book ever!",I wasted over $100 on this aweful Calculus textbook. There is no way you can read this book without a Calculus teacher/tutor in the same room and learn anything. This book was obviously not tested on students. It does not provide even 10% enough examples to help one solve most of the exercises.
2,Order of topics is at times nonsensical.,"The depth of content, description and examples is truly lacking in this text. Further, the order of material is not always in a progressive fashion, instead attempting to force the full understanding of the previous skills by requiring mastery for the next. This is a signifigant hinderance to someone who may not have a strong skill in one topic but could in the next"
4,National Board Workbook,This workbook was very helpful throughout the National Board Process. It offered excellent advice and helped me to feel more comfortable with the process and what was expected. It was definately worth the money and time to review.
5,Captures Uzbekistan from an Outsider's Viewpoint,"Thanks for a great book Tom. My five years in Uzland came streaming back to me when you described the innocent pairing of PCVs after the swearing in ceremony, the militsyia stops in the middle of nowhere, the reuniting with your host family and the constant araq! Your point of view was honest and alluring. Your book is a great snapshot in time of a land most, regretably, won't get the opportunity to see."
3,"Whatever album has ""The White Space""","All I know is I saw the Lucy Show open for Love & Rockets at the Eagle's Club in Milwaukee yearrrrrs ago (mid 80s) and fell in love with their sound. Even got to meet them - they were really nice. They played a song called 'White Space'. It was a GREAT Song!!! Then they seemed to disappear from Earth.Whatever album has that song on it, I want it! Was it only a b-side to 'Ephemeral' (This Is No Heaven)?This album, 'Mania', is good but I prefer the earlier songs I have heard."
4,Almost but not quite,"OK so i bought this last june and have loved it ever since. It has awsome sound quality with some good sony headphones and u can always turn on the FM. This would be a 5 star review if i was able to add on memory. My player would delete all the files i was trying to send into it after about 3 files. I was using a 64mb SanDisk card which is one of the best. Now i just have 64mb... o well its better then 32mb like some of the compitition. Its aluminum case feels very sturdy because i have dropped it a few times and have not lost any sound quality. Overall, if u have the bucks to get it, (try ebay like i did, i got it for $...) then get this player. If you want an awsome player with 128mb and u think ud use it all, check out the heftier Intel Pocket Concert."
5,Best Buy Ever,"I recently purchased the Rave 2200 series mp3 player. It was more than what I had expected. It super small, comes with a wired remote on ear bud head phones, it transfers very fast from the PC to Mp3, and its upgradeable with a Smart Media Card. It only uses 1 AA battery and it has 10 hours of playtime. Sound quality is superior. I'm glad I picked this over the nomad II. The only down side to the rave is there is no back lit lcd screen and no belt clip. Guess you can't have it all."
4,A generally useful work,"This is the most complete guide to punctuation that I know. It is generally very useful. However, at times it tends to sit on the fence rather than to take a position. An example is the use of a comma when an interrupting phrase immediately follows a conjunction (section 21.12). The book gives four possible ways of handling this, but offers no guidance on which is the preferred or most usual option, or what principles should be applied in order to select the one most suitable to a given set of conditions."
1,Bad Experience...,"The first time I used it; I put it on and swam a few laps, And then one of my friends said ""hey look at your cap"". I took it off and it went from a color white to an stained awful mustard yellow... I don't recommend this product for anyone."
3,Let Down a little,"I love Jack Higgins but this one fell a bit short. Not as exciting as some of his other works. I was a bit disappointed. Not a bad book by any means, just not as great as some of his other works. Won't stop me from reading the next one."
5,Suspenseful and Fantastic!,"A Season In Hell is about drugs in Europe and what people do to get them. It is also about a woman's struggle to find out how her stepson was murdered. The two main characters, Sarah and Sean are very, very intense. The story takes place all throughout Europe. The book ends very well and is unexpected.I loved this book! It was amazing. I love the way Jack Higgins wrote this book. The book is non-stop suspense. I would recommend it very, very highly."
5,"Finally, a new band that isn't so recycled and dull","Let's start this off right, first... They don't sound anything like the Strokes, the White Stripes, Moron 5, Mother Mary, Santa Claus or the easter bunny.Why do ""music critics"" try so hard to box up bands they review and slap a comparision on them. I guess it's just a cynically charged way of saying they've been there and done that. Like anyone really cares what they think anyway. Yuck...The Cold War Kids mix a bit of Soul (their vocals) with a bit of Indie and some old New York Punk feeling. I would say their are similar to the Walkmen or Spoon, but you can decide for yourself.This album is worth buying if you are interested in hearing something different, yet pleasing to the ears."
3,Interesting enough to give a listen too.,"The cold war kids definately try hard, i'll give them that. I would describe thier sound as The Walkmen's stepkids. Musically it catches your ear, but the vocals tend to wear on you and become a little much. I noticed so much Walkmen in this album first 3 or 4 songs that it really turned me off, but I love the Walkmen and after futhur listening it grew on me. There is a few very good tracks on this one but as a whole this album falls short. That is not to say that these cold war kids don't have a masterpiece in them. With the right producer and focus they could be a force to be reckoned with."
5,A Good CD To Begin A Peggy Lee Collection....,"...Now that Ms. Lee is Gone,many people would be inclined to get oneof the ""Best Of..."" CD's---I say begin with THIS CD...the recording sonics are verywell done, capturingPeggy's VOICE just right on the songs,whichinclude 'uptempo' and slow numbers--the cd hasan ""intimate"" quality which is hard to describe...As a sidelight,Frank Sinatra was conductorof the backup orchestra on several of the songs.This cd also includes possibly themost-'underrated' Peggy Lee song: ""The Folks Who Live On the Hill"",a song which may reflect her feelingsabout her troubled childhood...You cannot gowrong with this CD if you like femalevocalists,of which Peggy was up therewith the Top Four of all time.Keep THIS ONE in your collection,and pass it on to your children...."
2,Boring and Boring,"Relegate this film to the Woody Allen dungheap of ""Shadows and Fog"" and ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"". The premise of telling the same story as both comedy and tragedy is poorly executed. The dramatic story works only slightly better because it is graced by superb performances by Radha Mitchell and Chloe Sevigny. The comic story features a turn by Will Ferrell as an Allen surrogate that is almost painful to watch. My jaw drops at how talented actors, probably working for scale, would involve themselves in such dross just so they can get on their resumee that they were in a Woody Allen film. I'm also amazed that the studios continue to bankroll Allen's self-indulgence."
1,Really weak; not worth your time.,"Watching Will Farrell try to throw off weak nebbish Woody Allen lines was painful to watch -- both stunk. The film takes a twist on ""Rashomon"" -- presenting how different people might think a scenario plays out (tragic vs. comedic). Were it not for Woody Allen's name, this film would drop into well-deserved oblivion. Unless you're a die-hard Woody fan, this one is not worth your time."
1,"come on people, we can do better","I read of these people saying 'this book saved my life'... truth is YOU saved your life. If it helped you to believe a doorknob did it for you, then so be it. But, folks, it is the 21st century... there is WAY more out there now to help. Do not be fooled that it is the only way-- it isn't. This book's messages are religious, frightfully outdated and detrimental to your self-esteem.... such as the message: ""The Only people who fail don't work the program properly"" That is a shameful message to give. And, when one considers the dismal success rate of AA, don't you think it just may perhaps be time to stop blaming individuals and start blaming the program itself? SACRELIGIOUS!!!!, I know."
3,Good Old Lifesaver,"I have known too many friends who have walked the Twelve Steps not to know that this system works. It is easy to identify with the various authors who share their story of hitting bottom and beginning the road to recovery. For those alone the book is worth buying.On the negative side is the fact that medical understanding of this disease it far more developed than when the book was written. Bill W. was writing at a time when alcoholism was generally accepted to be a moral flaw rather than a very real disease. As it came to be recognized as a disease, a lot of research was done which has expanded our knowledge of this illness. Society has also changed -- the section on the wife of the alcoholic is so ancient that it almost makes one want to cry.Bottom line -- I'd buy this book again. As they say, "".it works if you work it."""
4,Big Book helpful,This book is very helpful to understand the concepts around AA. I recommend it to all who are in the healthcare profession and who are going through the struggles of trying to become sober.
5,Great fun!,Man talk about hyperactive fun!This is a great kite and extremely fun to play! Just watch out for the speed! It literally dances on your command.
3,Just Cute,"I thought this was a cute little book. I'm probably not the target, but I think this would be a great gift for a girl going off to college. I think it MAY have helped me. Still, it gave me some good advice and a starting point to do A LOT of additional research. I must admit, I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up!"
4,Seal takes his time putting albums out and it shows,"Not a weak track on here....I guess good things do come to those who wait.Although I really like 'Humans Being', I could tell that it would not be nearly as popular as Seal I and II. This album is definately back on that track, with a little 'Humans Being' thrown in, in the right places.The songs are a nice mix of upbeat and ballad, with precise production quality as always....Seal fans should be happy with this overall effort.Seal's voice seems to be timeless...hopefully we'll get a few more great albums before age catches up with that awesome voice."
4,"Bueno, pero no es impactante","Siempre al comprar un disco de Seal espero, al terminar de escucharlo, quedar con una sensación de haber escuchado un trabajo MUY bien hecho, como ocurrió con su primera producción.Este no fue el caso. Sin menospreciar lo que ha logrado hasta ahora, con un estilo que lo distingue, para mi no es igual a su primer trabajo. Aunque sin duda, logra mantener niveles muy buenos de calidad en su trabajo."
5,Can't go wrong with the one of kind voice of Seal!!!!!,Every since his self titled CD released in 1994. I have been a huge unwavering fan of Seal's and this CD definately stood up to my high expectations. I love it and like it just as much as when I first brougt it a few years ago. Just added everything of his that I have to my new ipod touch.
5,This is comming from someone who wasn't a Seal fan,"What can I say? I didn't hate Seal, but the only songs that I liked were ""prayer for the dying"", and ""crazy"". There's just something about this record that I like better and I have only heard about half of the songs on it. I tuned in because of ""waiting for you"" but the song that really got me hooked was ""Love's divine"" that one has classic written all over it. Needless to say, if you are already a Seal fan there's no reason not to get this album. If you aren't a Seal fan you should still try it, you might just get hooked."
5,Nice,"Seal is an artist whose music is an acquired taste. Not because his music is terrible, its because his music is different. He has a great voice and terrific delivery. His lyrics are introspective but also something that everyone can relate to. The only complaint I have is that there are a lot of slower songs. He does well with both slow and fast songs. 4-1/2 stars."
4,Good at the right price,"This is a decent printer. It is possible to get it unbelievably cheap if you look around for refurbed ones.The picture quality is absolutely acceptable, and I didn't find it too noisy. It's a little slow (about 1 minute per 4x6 in high quality mode) but for the price, what can one expect?It does use a lot of ink, so I'll have to see what the final print costs end up being - but Canon has the cheapest 4x6 glossy photopaper I could find (unless you find some noname brand) - and they are among the most reasonable on ink cartridges as well.I think regardless of printer, it is probably better to print most your pictures at a store these days, but for emergencies and maybe large size prints as well, this printer does the trick."
2,Decent output; outrages maintenance cost.,"This printer produces decent output for this price range. Real-world Speed is quite good and appropriate for any occasional printing. A bit on the wide side but does not occupy too much desk space. My main complaint however, is that Canon (like most other printer manufacturers for low-end printers) sells the black dye and color ink cartridges at a very steep price. The black cartridge only comes with 11 ml of ink and the color cartrige comes with only 3 ml for cyan, magenta or yellow. So be ready for high costs per printout. At first, I thought this printer would be appropriate for the occasional printout but each (full) cartridge replacement costs of the printer's initial cost. Therefore, I cannot recommend this printer. Get a higher end model even if you do not expect to print that much as long-term costs will be lower."
5,Dried Cherries,The cherries were firm and good sized. They were packaged well and the delivery was very quick. Filled the need that we had to get our cookies done on time.
3,Interesting but..... Very fake looking!,"It has a good story line but when it comes to the ""scary"" parts with the cat zombie they are very fake looking I like it is pretty good for a seven to ten year old child!"
4,Love My Goosebumps,I love all the Goosebumps movies and this one is no exception. It's scary without being too frightening. I can't wait to get the other new ones that recently came out on DVD!
3,Not as good as expected,I was really expecting a lot more from this product for the cost. It does have very good coverage and lasts quite a long time (not quite all day though) but if you have any areas where skin is a little dry this make-up will really highlight those areas and make it feel drier.
5,Oh how I love this album,"Rarely do I actually buy an album because usually I only like one or two songs and then the rest of the music shows just how little originality or actual musical understanding the artist has. Not so with this album, which I absolutely fell in love with at first listening, and it only gets better as I listen to all the layers. Just when you think you could sing along, Ian does something to change up the beat or melody, and he uses long musical passages or ""white space"" unexpectedly and thoughtfully in between the lyrics to drive home a deeper meaning. Really listen to ""Time is My Everything"" and see if you don't love it. Oh, how I love this album. This and Music of the Spheres just absolutely rock."
1,Incredibly bad album!,"I hadn't heard of Stone Roses before, but had heard Keep What You've Got on the radio and thought it was a pretty decent track. The DJ mentioned that Noel Gallagher produced the track, and that piqued my interest a little more. So, I took a chance and sought the album out.The album is shockingly bad, especially in comparision to the two good songs on it - the leadoff track, and Keep What You've Got. The rest of the album is over-produced garbage. It reminds me of the 80's synth-pop that was so popular (and boring) in my childhood.Do yourself a favor and track down the single of Keep What You've Got, and maybe download the first track off iTunes - but don't waste your time or money on this pathetic album."
3,A good General Reference,"While this book covers the basics, it is lacking in some areas. The general Exchange setup (along with clients) is thoroughly covered, but it lacks in some of the specialized areas of Exchange 5.5 (nothing mentioned about the IRC services, little about Outlook Web Access). If you are setting up a fairly generic Exchange setup, this is a good reference book. If you are looking for details on some of the more esoteric Exchange functions, another book may be up your alley. (Although the book is well worth the price as a reference)"
2,Quality has fallen...,"I am also a real estate appraiser, and used to love these wheels. I feel they have the best design for indoor use, with the rounded housing (good for tilting against walls, etc), good rubber grip and rubber rings on the pole for quick tightening/untightening. However, the last few that I've purchased have been poor quality - inaccurate measuring (in houses, just roll along standard 1 foot tiles to verify), or a counter that would *skip* or not register at all without a little coaxing. Bought 3 or 4 in a row now with the same problems, and sadly I am now looking elsewhere for an accurate wheel (although still no one beats the design/housing)."
1,What happened to this product!,We had used these for years without a problem but the last 3 out of 4 I purchased broke within a week of use: Jamming & the counters not resetting. Beware.
5,"Another fine recording from ex-Mole, ex-Cardinal","Eric Matthews sounded the first trumpet in the battle between the ex-members of the orchestral pop band Cardinal, but Davies more than returns the serve with this, his second solo album. The bottom line with this album is that Davies can write excellent songs. Melodies, harmonies and instrumentation. Qualities that are often overlooked in todays race for the record of the moment. Richard Davies excells in making these the foundation of excellent albums. Although he will receive little ""Fanfare"" for his efforts, with ""Telegraph"" Richard Davies once again proves he is towards the top of the pantheon when it comes to making enjoyable music."
2,Universal Stand Doesn't Work,The universal stand doesn't work to shoot the laser put of the bottom. This laser is almost always necessary to use the laser that shoots up. Until this gets fixed this product isn't very useful.
3,Retro-psychadelia that is almost too far-out for words,"This album would seem to be perfect for the fans of early Pink Floyd (pre Dark Side), Sgt. Pepper, and various other gems in the musical crown of the sixties. Well, it is and it isn't. It certainly fits into the genre of psychedelic music. Everything about it is far out. Much of the album is SO far out, that it becomes boring. There is a stretch of about eight (approx.) tracks in the middle of the album which are just so out there they are bad. If this album were pruned to half of it's twenty-plus tracks, it would be much better. Fans of seriously psychedelic music will find several things to enjoy, but they will also be disappointed by the album as a whole. Buy the classics first, then buy this album to see the difference. Comparing this album to albums like ""Sgt.Pepper"" is like comparing the original Psycho with Anthony Perkins to the remake with Vince Vaughan. It's true what they say, ""They don't make 'em like they used to""."
3,why??,"i actually downloaded this from emusic due to being curious about jim suhler, and at first i enjoyed it until after i listened to burnside on burnside and live in session with albert king and srv,even though these arent my favourite albums either they highlited the fact that the cd is sorely lacking somthing, chemistry. theres none of it, even though lots of the guitar playing is real nice, the vocals take it nowhere and the backing band are awfull, sorry jim, i just bought bad juju and i love it but this??! why?still, ive given it 3 stars because if you play it loud enough it doesnt matter so much, i just love blues guitar and theres some good extended solos here with more than a few nods to t-bone walker amongst it all"
4,Trial insights presented with humor,"Mr. Miller has compiled tales from the courthouse in a witty, insightful style. As other reviewers have noted this is not a trial manual; nonetheless, it provides innumerable insights into trial lawyering skills and would be an addition to any inspiring trial attorney's library.Kevin P. Sheerin"
2,Been There...Done That,"In ""On Trial"", attorney Henry Miller treads over well worn ground. Mr. Miller comes up with a few new maxims, but for the most part, this is just a re-hash of every trial technique book that has ever been published. Mr. Miller's style of referring to lawyers as Mr. Barrister, or Mr. Blunder was refreshing at first, but became distracting as the book went on. One of the positives of the book however, was the chapter on defeat. Mr. Miller writes that while contract lawyers never win or lose, trial lawyers lose all the time, and living with defeat is what separates true trial lawyers from the other timid souls. Overall, a good introduction to trial techniques, but for those who are more experienced, this book may seem repetitive."
3,Missing the Amon-ospheric,"He pulled a DJ Shadow on us..... couple great tracks but otherwise, experimental sound. He's reaching, but for what? Bring on the Bricolage and Jazz meets experimental. Try his Steel CD compilation..... and the old stuff. Or see him live in concert. This CD to staged...."
1,I DON'T LIKE IT (It needs a negative review),"I don't like this album, it is extremely boring. I'm not holding it to comparison to anything prior by Amon Tobin. I don't like it because I found myself fast fowarding through parts in search for something more.I wanted the grass to get greener and this was never the case. I also search for something in music that I might enjoy, or even a singular sound that I can sample and exploit.This album failed to entertain me, or make me feel energized. Even with the hope of discovering some cool sounds it is a total let down."
3,Well made but floppy,"This organizer is a good value for the money, but we would like it a lot more if the sides would stay up when it is empty. Because it folds itself down when empty, you can't simply drop items into it. You need to hold the sides up with one hand while you load the first item. If you already have something large in it (say a bag of groceries), the sides will stay up."
4,Great organizer,"I originally had a crate that I threw all the items in that I need to carry in the back of my SUV. After it fell apart, this was the item I decided to try. Due to the description, I didn't realize it was a completely soft case with no permanently standing sides, but I decided to go with it anyways. I am actually very happy with the design as it is very nice to stuff it as full as I need and not have the limitations of rigid sides and I love being able to zip it shut and have it look that much neater. The zipper also allows me to put other items in when needed that I don't want people to see from looking in the windows. The outside pockets are great for keeping frequently used items handy and the nylon material will not attract any fur from my dogs who ride in back with the organizer. All in all, a very good purchase and leap of faith."
3,Full of insight,A Yale professor stated that no one should have a degree from Yale without having read this book. He then said that if he was in charge no one could be a citizen without having read this book and then confessed that he was not yet in charge. Having read the book I feel I am a better qualified citizen.
4,Seminal work,"I recently finished this important work. There are some slower parts, but the insights are well worth the wait. It is heart wrenching to read of the various abuses Blacks have endured in the ""land of the free,"" but inspiring to see the character of those willing to endure under great hardship."
4,Beast of Burden,"If you deal with people who have melanin this book will help you. I saw:That African people's souls are damaged.African people are resistant to knowledge.African people have been hooked on ""jobs"" for a long time.And More"
3,Souls of Black Folk,"The Soul's of Black folk is an storied-tale of Negro's hardships, challenges and racial barriers during post-slavery. It highlights various stories of the Negro expeirence in an informative and pragmatic form. The Soul's of Black Folk is a good read; however, it does not provide a comphrensive state of the Negro expierence. It focuses on the deep South and the illiteracy and complaceny of black folk among other things, but it does not provide in-depth historical expeirenes of the Negro people. In sum, it does not provide an enriched history lessen of the Negro expeirence. Its a good book, but it should be read after other books that can provide a complete picture of the Negro expeirence."
4,laser level,"It is a great product, makes the leveling pipeline very easy for electricity, and the alignment of machines, another Stanley's great success"
1,Piece of JUNK,"This laser level is junk. Save your money by not purchasing this item.The battery holder does not make good, 'CONSISTENT' contact when switched on. It works intermittently.The metal contacts were dis-colored too.And the holder is very flimsy, does not sit snug in the level.I wish I had seen and tested this item at home depot or lowe's before buying on amazon,otherwise I definitely would've opted for a different brand.Did I mention this one IS JUNK?"
3,RE: laser level,"Was well satisfied with price and delivery, cannot say anything regarding function as it was purchased as a gift and I have not recieved any feedback yet. Thus far I have been very satisfied with all my Amazon purchases."
4,"Informative, but unsurprisingly, a dry read","The subject is one of large recent debate, given the rising popularity of Ron Paul and his libertarian perspective. This book does a very good and thorough job of explaining the economic theory of money and credit per Ludwig von Mises. However, it can be some dry stuff without a passion for the topic."
4,Deep pool of wisdom and intelligence,"I've read a couple of books by Von Mises and this one, probably not his best, is solid and amazing in it's detailed description of finance. A bit dry for the non-economist, it's strength is it's attention to detail. The Austrian school of economics is extremely interesting to me but this book doesn't have the usability and real world examples of economic activity that the Hazlitt's and Hayek's have included in their works. In summary, a deep and detailed book that if you study economics, you will enjoy."
2,"Excellent book, bad edition","Get the edition published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute (mises.org). It is MUCH better. It contains the forwards and prefaces by the author, the translator, and Murray Rothbard. Additionally, the editing is much, much better. I had this version, but it was so frustrating that I ended up buying the better version in addition.Amazon sells the STUDY GUIDE to accompany the Mises Institute version, but not the book itself."
5,Steve Miller Band Abracadabra,I think that this is an excellent classic rock album from the 80's by the Steve Miller Band if your a big fan of the band like I am it's worth having in your collection all the songs really sound cool.
3,Sterling Silver Swirl Drop Earrings by Zina,"Wife likes them, so I like them.The connection part may be a bit too loose, depending on the size of the hole of your piercing."
1,Not Really What I Ordered,"I was under the impression that I was getting the standard Opium EDT for my wife's birthday..... and instead I got something with a black cap; it said ""Opium"" on the bottle, but it doesn't smell like the real product.I feel that I had a 'bait & switch' pulled on me, but as it was a birthday present we are now stuck with it.QUITE disappointed."
3,uuuhmm?,I thought this is what I ordered but what I recieved was a 3 unce bottle. Very pretty but the sprayer is hard to distiguish where it is gong to come from. As in sometimes I just spray air. I love the smell of Opium so I will survive.. Next time I will double check the bottle type and size
5,Good Salsa combinations or patterns,Salsa & Merengue 1-2-3 is a video of Salsa combinations from basic to advanced. This video is better viewed after you have learned the steps in her Hot Salsa series. Please note forms/ patterns/ combinations like this are used to teach you how to flow from one move to the next without a break. Please do not use these patterns in a nightclub as many other people also know these patterns & they will may laugh at you. Please note the tempo of the Salsa music in her videos. If the music is faster remember to speed up the moves. I have read comments on the message boards about people using these forms to different speeds of music. The idea is to use these forms then change then to suit the music. Mix the forms up. Josie also includes some basic shines. Josie uses the same pattern to teach as her Hot Salsa video. Josie then teaches the basic Merengue techniques.
5,My boyfriend loves this one the most!,This video is best when you learn from Josie Neglia's Dance Hot Salsa Videos 1&2 which break down every pattern count-for-count.This video is great because it teaches leaders how to put a few steps together in a sequence to create flow.My boyfriend memorized all the 8 combinations and uses them when we dance in the club. He liked it because he used to always get stuck when he danced in the clubs. He didn't know which step to do next so he would do the basic step over and over again until he remembered the next step. This video changed alll that! He learned these combinations (5 or 6 patterns put together) and now he looks SMOOTH!I definitely recommend this video to leaders especially.
1,Animals deserve only love and tenderness,"Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book."
3,started with this book but have found better aproaches,"I trained my first dog using this book and another by the Monks of New Skete. Six years later, as I began training my second dog, I re-read the books and became uncomfortable with the degree of force recommended. So I looked farther afield and found other approaches that are kinder and better suited to how I want to work with my best friends. I recommend reading ""Bones would rain from the sky"" by Susanne Clothier before selecting a training approach."
2,disappointing and silly,"Although there are good rules at the end of this book, it is only useful to someone who can spend his/her entire day exercising the dog. Any dog who is so tired from exercising eight hours a day is going to behave well. It is a silly book. I found Marley and Me more useful."
2,Lacking overall,"Needs more in the way of graphics. Pictures of actual hardware, exploded views, something. This book reads like a collection of technical papers on various aspects of engine design."
4,The Very Busy Spider,"The Very Busy Spider is a great book for kids. Ilove it because it just focuses on what a spider does in one day. Spinds the web, spinds the web, spinds the web, etc. An at the end of the day catches the fly. It is kind of what we do as human being. We work, work, work, and after we work somemore, play! That is kind of what the spider did at the end of her day. It is a good book for kids because it shows them lots of colorful pictures. The illustrations are great for litte 3 year olds. This is a great book. I even like to read it when I can!! I have given this book 4 stars because it teaches kids the basics about insects."
3,"Classic book, tiny copy","The book is amazing, of course. Eric Carle is a great author. However, this book is ridiculously small. It barely fits in your hand. I was hoping for a book that I could easily flip through with my nephew, but it's too small. Disappointing!"
5,One of his best,"This book is one of his better ones- along with The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Brown Bear Brown Bear. The repitition of ""She was very busy spinning her web"" creates a rhythm to the story, the pictures of the animals on the farm are very beautiful and the ending is lovely. Yes- it's not a thrilling book but it is soothing and a great bedtime book because of its cadence and its culmination. My 13 month daughter has loved this one since being a few weeks old- she calms down and watches very intently and now is interested in touching the texture of the web in the book."
4,"Good message, but not so entertaining","My daughter is 3 months old, and she will listen to this story since it is short. I love the message. I would give it 5 stars, but she doesn't get absorbed in it like The Very Hungry Catapillar."
2,not told it was a small book,I wish the information given about the book would have mentioned it was a very small book. I was very disappointed at the size.
5,Love it!,This is a great book. The spider web is 3-d so when you are reading along with the book you can feel the spider web too. Eric Carle art is always so beautiful this book enhances the reading experience.
2,Be warned!,"This book is a miniature version. If you are looking for a board book, this is not the one you should be buying..."
3,Watchout for size!,"Watchout for the size of the hardcover version... it is a 3 x 5 book! I was all excited about getting such a good price... oops. The book itself is great, however!"
2,F-luke warm,"Short and simple, as many reviewers here, I've read a number of Moore's other stuff and enjoyed them immensely. This one just didn't work for me but it does have its moments. Nate is a whale biologist trying to figure out why whales sing and to what purpose. Clay is his photographic partner in the research. Amy is the self-proclaimed luscious assistant, and Kona is the transplanted New Jersey boy that thinks he's Rastafaran and provides the comic relief. Slow moving book and then there's a giant step of open-mindedness in the last third of the book regarding the Goo. My wife loved the story finding it highly humorous, I didn't. There's better Moore books out there already."
4,Christopher Moore's Fluke,"I enjoy reading Moore's books, they are entertaining and it is very easy to get hooked on them! Buy One today!"
3,Fair enough,"Started out as one book and almost seemed to turn into a completely different one by the end. A good read, but not Moore's best."
2,for anyone involved in the War on Cetaceans,Mildly entertaining but not particularly inspired. The premise wore a bit thin on me quite quickly and the stereotyped romantic injection that Moore includes seemed hard to get behind.
3,Entertaining...,"I had to read this book for as part of a college class. It wasn't so much to critique the book as it was to get an idea of character development. As far as characters go, the good thing about Fluke is that the characters are somewhat like cartoon characters. Each has their own quirks and distinct personalities. So for the point of defining characters, making each one unique and well illustrated, I think Fluke does it well.The humor is also done well in this book if you're looking for something more grown-up than humor in movies like Dumb and Dumber but not as crass as in movies like Dodgeball.So, yeah, this book is entertaining but not something I will read again or recommend to anyone else to read. I guess, since I had to read this book for class I was just glad it wasn't a complete bore."
3,"Fluke: Or, I know while the winged whale sings.",Moore is an evil genius with plans to take over the world and enslave humanity. The only chance we have is if we distract him by buying his books and inflating his ego. Buy his books: save humanity.
4,great return to his original style,"I'll first assume the reader is a longtime Chris Moore fan. If so, you will recognize immediately that Fluke is a return to his pre-Lamb format. The book it most closely resembled was Coyote Blue. It starts as a academic_science comedy/mystery, then suddenly shifts to being a science_fiction comedy/action_thriller. (Lots of slashes when trying to characterize a Moore book.)As usual, the plot takes second fiddle to the comedy, and tends to have some rough edges. The characterization and comedy is first rate, some of Moore's best.I rate it higher than most of his other novels, but perhaps not as good as Coyote Blue or especially Bloodsucking Fiends (still his best). There are some great laugh-out-loud lines in here, and even when the plot falls apart at the end, the humor stays as strong as ever."
3,3 1/2 stars would be more accurate,"For anyone looking for a break from the mundane, cliche novels that are out there, then Christopher Moore will certainly fit the bill; and Fluke is no exception. The story is of a whale biologist and his eventful (and unbelievable) research in Hawaii. Of course, Moore's insane and inane plot devolves from there.Although this book delivered a few laughs, I did not find it nearly as funny as ""A Dirty Job"" (although Moore's comments on ""advanced poop-chute technology"" should not be missed).The plot overall is as crazy and unexpected as you would expect from Moore, but seems to drag a little toward the end. Also, I was not terribly happy with the resolution of everything.The characters are very likeable, but do not seem to do much growing over the course of the novel.Fluke is worth checking out if you are a fan of Moore's, or if you have some free time on your hands, but you may be better off getting it at the library."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first book by Christopher Moore that I have read, and most likely the last. It was probably not the best one to start with. After reading Fluke, I cannot imagine reading another of Mr. Moore's books unless I am totally desperate for reading material. It was mildly entertaining, but honestly? I have had more enjoyment reading cereal boxes."
3,A little disappointed,"the lock is kinda short and firmly built. As other reviews pointed out, I do not trust to use it for the long term safety. But it is so cheap, I guess it is ok if you just use it on the bike in some secured parking lot indoors as I do. Otherwise, you had better shop for a better lock"
2,same ol' same ol',"nothing special, nothing enticing ... on the lines of frodor's and fromor's, just a bit more inefficient ... DK gives you pictures and more straight-forward facts .. i had purchased my usual DK (love the pics, the format, the lack of bias) and then once i chose my islands wanted a bit of something else .. went to amazon for reviews (don't we all) and found two island specific books which got FAB reviews and sounded perfect (Maui Revealed and Hawaii the big island revealed by doughty and friedman) but i also wanted one of all the islands so i got this ... so, i got disapointed .. the basics, a bit biased, unorganized .. love the Maui and Big Island books mentioned above .. they didn't do lanai which i'm also visiting, but do believe tehy do kaui .... i'd say spend your money on a DK and pick one of the focus books i mention .. if you want a bland book then go for this, fodor's or fromor's (though i would pick the ""F"" books over this"
3,Non-updated edition of the Loeb,"Although this book does provide both the Latin and an English translation, the English itself must be translated to a more modern form of English. To anyone looking for dual language buy something other than the Loeb edition."
2,Where'd That Great Show Go,Zatch Bell is an amazing series but only for a certain amount of episodes. Here Zatch is put as a children's show and you can tell by all the editing and episodes of them taking nothing seriously. Then you have more episodes that are annoying and pointless. There's too much playing going on in this series and it seems to be so they can stretch it into a long long series and it doesn't have to be. It's a great show but with a lot of unneeded baggage and these episodes fall into that spot.
4,Garmin StreetPilot c340,The c340 is a Solid performer. I originally purchased the Lowrance C350. What a mistake!I returned the product (Lowrance)3 times and finally asked for a refund. Lowrance does have good customer service. Go with the Garmin product line! I highly recommend it.
3,Battery Woes with c340,"I have enjoyed my Garmin c340. I like the large database of locations I can type in and get directions to. It is probably as accurate as friends' competing units.As others have said, sometimes it tells you to turn just a little too late. Having only used two GPS units, both Garmins, I cannot say this is a unique failing to all or some Garmins only. It is not always easy to read on a sunny day since the screen is not too bright. The worst, however, is that in less than a year, the lithium battery failed so the unit must be plugged into a power source. You cannot take it into your hotel room to plan the next day's venu. Without that plug in the cigarette lighter it is dead, and according to the manual, you cannot replace the battery yourself. If you look at sites like Amazon, you will find that replacement lithiums are available for other GPS units. I am about to buy a family member a GPS, but will certainly not consider the c340 becuase of the battery problem with no easy fix."
3,OK product with a coupple exceptions,The connection to the power cord is poorly engineered - broke on my first Garmin. The companty replaced it - good news but the replacement is now hosed.
3,GPS is fine but CRADLE(Mount) doesn't work,This GPS unit works fine..I used it in NY/NJ/CT and also we went to Toronto 2 weeks back..It worked as we expected...The only draback it has is its Craddle(Mount)..Doesn't hold/sticks to thewindshiled/Dashboard for long time..And this duration has decreased to 5 minutes..Now I have to hold it in my lap and I listen to the voice prompts from the GPS..I willappriciate if someone can provide me the contact details of AMAZON.com...So that I can call them to get it replaced..ThanksSanjeev
5,Best value for speaking street names,"I believe this Garmin c340 is currently the best value Garmin navigation device. I consider the feature of speaking the actual street names to be my must have feature. This feature will tell you to ""Turn right on Franklin Street"" instead of just ""Turn right in 500 feet."" My unit delivered on August 3rd with the v2008 preloaded maps has an amazing amount of preloaded points of interest to get you just about anywhere you need to go in the entire US and Canada. Thanks Garmin!"
1,"""Gertrude""","This is really great, went all the way to a town in Georgia without looking at a map !!!!! Gertrude put me right in the front of my granddaughter's house !!! Amazing."
2,Consider Cobra 2100 GPS +speed/redlight camera alert+Free updates,Consider Cobra GPSm 2100 navigation with free updates & speed camera/red light camera updates. I use it with my Valentine one radar & its fun and safe way to drive on long trips with such investments that keep you awake & make trip exciting & ticket free. Check out GPSM 2100 not because its cheap but seriously consider its features. I enjoy Cobra GPSM 2100 & valentine one radar detector both. I remove Radar detector in Washington & VA but keep the GPS on. It works great!
4,GPS Review c340,"I heve not yet taken the GPS on a long trip but expect to do so very soon. I did loan it to my daughter and grandson for a trip east. She expressed it was a life saver to travel from JFK into New Jersey, then to Connecticut and eventually to Boston. My concerns are the lack of a comprehensive operating manual. The provided instructions are very rudimentary. For instance, it indicates there is battery. I have yet determined where it is. Is it rechargable? How do you access the battery?Another question is, can the GPS be used internationally? Could it be used in Europe? If so, how do you program the intelligence and how is it made available?Being a resident of California. I am not allowed to use the windshield mount. I wish I had known that upon purchase so that I would know to order the dashboard mount.The last comment is relative to their apparent lack of attention to customer inquiries. I have sent at least two emails asking for assistance and have failed to get any response."
5,Good to Go,"Out of the box Set the basics Type your destination and off you goStreet names announced , re- directed if you miss a turn.This GPS is a must !!!"
4,Product is as represented in ad.,The item arrived well packaged and as represented. It was ready to operate as it came out of the box. In the car and operational without any technical knowledge needed.
3,Frustrating to set up with Mac,"The GPS unit itself works great, and is intuitive and easy to use. HOWEVER, it is a horror to set up if you have a Mac! Even though the website claims they now support Mac, they are really useless when it actually comes to it. I initially had to set it up with a borrowed PC (predictably, the software was ridiculously unintuitive; when the so-called mac update, was announced--many months after it was supposed to come out--I ordered my free update CD, having finally figured out how to get it from their unwieldy website. Forget downloading the files or maps directly from the site, even with the various and confusing unlock codes you have to use! The CD arrives in a few weeks: no Mac update on it, no help on the website. You would think that nowadays any big and well known company would in this day and age provide Mac support (not to mention web downloads of additional programs/maps!). Very disappointing."
4,GPS Navigator,We've used it for a couple trips within 200 miles from home. It lead us right to the store's front door and to the mission school we were looking for. What a remarkable little gadget! Our son used it in his car since it's portable. We think it's a lot of fun and so easy to use.
5,My friend was right,I bought the Garmin C340 because a friend of mine had one and I was really impressed at what it would do. It was everything he said it was. I took several 300 mile trips and when I needed gas or a place to eat all I had to do was enter my request and bingo it was either the next exit or one or two thereafter. A really neat product and one in which would help the least gadget minded find their way to any valid address. Thanks for all the fun.
5,Garmin c340,I find this item to be very easy to use and the directions are right on every place I have used it. I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for a GPS sytem.
3,"Nice, but could be better","Garmin StreetPilot c340 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorMap for my area a little out of date, which causes me concern if I were a stranger traveling in this area. Voice of ""emily"" has a hard time with speaking mult-syllable street names so bad you have to look at the read out and verify what she is saying, thus taking eyes off road. I recommend down loading their manual first and become familiar with its workings. If I were buying again, I would go for top of the line GPS from Garmin, they appear smaller and simpler.Having said that, this still is a good buy and will do the intended tasks"
4,Garmin 340C,"I am very pleased with my Garmin 340. I was especially pleased with the price. There are more fancy GPS Systems, but this one is all I need. It quickly locates the satellites and I seldom lose service. The only drawback and this is probably true with all GPS systems; It pays to have a general idea of where you are going because it does make mistakes. Also, it occasionally says something is on the right when it is on the left and vice-versa."
4,Great buy!,"Great GPS for your money! It's has lots of different POI's, so you can find anything you want. Very user friendly, and ready to go right out of the box. If you're looking for a GPS thats compact, easy to use, and portable, this is it!"
4,Nice product,Good product. Really helps in places you do not know. Takes a little long sometimes to acquire a signal.
4,Garmin Streetpilot C340 Portable GPS Navigation System,I recently used the Streetpilot for two trips one a short trip less than 150 miles and another approximately 1800 miles. I was impressed with the device. It was accurate to a couple of hundred feet. The only problem I encountered was on a stretch of Route 64 in North Carolina. It was obvious to me that the mapping software for that particular stretch of highway was not updated. But for the price it is a good value.
3,Still Trying to decide,I love the concept and the unit itself...I think my issue might be the maps that are pre-loaded. One time it told me to exit the highway when I was actually entering the highway. One time it told me to turn left when the do not turn left sign was quite visable (not to mention the median divider). I've entered the addresses and/or names of several businesses only to be informed that they did not exist. I was planning on phoning Garmin regarding this but have just not had the time....so the jury is still out in my case.
4,I would recommend the Garmin C340 for all drivers,"I've been using my Garmin C340 for about 3 weeks now and am well pleased with it. It is all you could ask for when getting directions to your destinations. Easy to use and set up. Also I highly recommend a optional dash mount for the unit, I think it is much better than using a window mount. Very easy to remove and take out when the vehicle is parked in public. My only drawback is the instructions you get from Garmin on updates to the Unit. The are lacking in easy to understand process for the normal human."
4,like it.... wish I wait for price drop,"I like the Nuvi 350 better b/c it is thinner but the price was higher than I would like to pay for. I bought the C340 for $470. Now Nuvi just drops to $540. Overall C340 is a very nice unit and it works quite well - took it on the soccer trips and found the field easily. Some limitation on new streets that are not yet updated on the map. It does not have a ""remember this location"" kind of feature. The unit is too heavy and keep drop down from the windshield. I may need to buy a sand bag to keep it on the deck instead. the software will remember your trip but it does not allow you to delete a specific one. Need more competition to lower the price"
1,Do not buy from Garmin,"Not that there is anything wrong with this unit, rather, you should be aware that Garmin's technical support is pretty bad. I waited 20 minutes on the line just to get to a technician. And the technician was pretty rude. Paying for a $500 unit, I would expect to get better support than that.Update:Garmin software fails miserably on my PC, I can't start any of the updater and Point of interests loader.To conclude, I wish I have never ordered this item."
4,"nice little GPS, but slow to start when surrounded by buildings","so far the garmin c340 has been great. i just moved to new york city and am on the road constantly, and the fact that it speaks out the actual street names about 200 feet before the actual turn is a huge plus (unless you're really speeding). the only problem i'm having is that satellite reception is difficult to acquire or completely lost when surrounded by tall buildings. i haven't explored all of its features, but it's been a dependable, ""some-frills"" product. be sure to explore a bit when looking for these; i found a garmin c530 for $50 less at staples here in the city, beating both amazon and j&r soundly."
4,Excellent but not perfect,"This is the second Garmin GPS I have owned. Have had the C340 for about 4 months. I find this unit a lot more accurate than the C330 and the having the street names announced makes all the difference in the world. Aquisition time and recaulculating are snappy. One phone call to Garmin phone support took only 4 minutes to reach the right person and question was promptly addressed.Cons: Volume is a tad to low for my hard of hearing ears. No software for Mac although I was told it would be available in the spring. My only other comment is that the final instruction to turn comes a bit too late if you are going fast or in a strange high traffic area.In conclusion a great product. Richard of Wichita Falls, TX"
4,Good so far,I had the StreetPilot C330 and after a little over a year it went toes up. The cost of repair was $225 and the cost to upgrade to the C340 was only $280 with shipping. A no brainer.The C340 actually calls out street names at turns which is a help over the last one (C330) It seems to be faster and it has the capability to accept an adapter to provide traffic jam rerouting. I have not added that option as it requires more equipment and a monthly charge.I should add that I considered switching to another brand. Both my C330 and my wife's C330 went toes up after a little more than one year just beyond the one year warranty. I wrote to Garmin and they have chosen to fix both under warranty even though it has been over one year. NICE!!!
4,Incredibly easy to use....,"I bought this unit from Amazon after a recommendation from a friend. Of all the consumer electronics I have ever bought - this is the easiest I have ever experienced. You really don't need a user manual.The unit gives excellent directions both through the screen as well as the voice prompts which are loud and clear....My only beefs: The suction cup mount which is provided with the unit does not hold it on the windshield well. I bought the gravity-based dashboard mount two weeks after I bought it and it works better...The unit does not have some new addresses it in. There is a new dormitory on the University of Alabama campus (opened in 2005) and the unit does not have it. I even plugged it into my computer with the supplied USB cable and did a software update (once again very very easy) and asked for map updates....still didn't have the address...Still, for the money it is a great unit....well constructed and extraordinarily easy to use....recommended."
5,street pilot c340,I gave it a 5 star because I dont know if there's a better one. I just went on a two week car trip and it worked great . If I didn't have a exact address I put in what I had and got pretty close to my address. I liked that it gave the street names for turning.
3,Gamin C340,Unfortunately the map/logic for Sarasota Florida leaves something to be desired. The prompts were sometimes in error and other times routed us into dead ends. The logic seemed to like U-turns. However the map displays are good and helpful. No problems with hookup....
4,Really Impressed,"Still working out the many options and screens but so far am very happy with this gadget. Very easy to use and very reliable. Direction guide a little sketchy, lots of trial and error which is tough if you're solo but doable. Go Jill !"
4,Very pleased,I am very happy with my factory refurbished Garmin GPS. Customer service is outstanding. It is extremely easy to program. I have not had it very long so I gave it 4 stars. If it continues at this level of all around satisfaction I will give it 5 stars.
4,Garmin GPS,Works well and easy to use. Reasonably priced. It would be nice if you could program in your favorite routes to avoid traffic.
4,Great GPS,"Well, I did quite a bit of research before buying this unit. Its a perfect out of the box unit. Comes ready to use. I made my first trip with it and drove 1300 miles. It solved all problems without fail. Detour feature works perfcect as I faced once a closed road. The points of interest looks a little old database,needs to be updated as I searched for a couple of things and it took me to no man's land.But overall a good buy. Gets the satellites pretty fast, and pretty user friendly."
4,Works great if you know how to set your preference,"Garmin Street Pilot C340 works great and easy to use. However, you must know how to select the settings. DO NOT select to avoid tolls. If you do so, you may end up driving thousands of extra miles before to get to the location."
2,Still rooms for improvement.,"The good about this is it say the name of the street and I supposed to keep my eyes on the road but wrong, it frequently would tell me to turn as I was passing the intersection or exit freeway with less a mile when I'm in a left lane, making the last notification useless, you still have to pay attention on the display."
3,GARMIN STREET PILOT C340,"IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT, BUT IT ONLY GIVES THE STRAIGHTEST ROUTE. IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE WHEN RECALCULATING THE ROUTE. IT'S GREAT FOR THE FINDING AN ADDRESS THE FIRST TIME. THE SYSTEM ONLY GIVE STRAIGHT LINE DRIVING, AND OFTEN TAKE YOU OUT OF THE WAY BECAUSE OF THIS."
2,Beware when it needs out of warranty service,I have had this unit for a year and a half. It needs a new battery. I contacted Garmin and it turns out that they charge a flat repair fee of $250 to fix anything wrong with the unit. I can currently purchase a new 340c for under $229.Expect ZERO support from Garmin for this unit when the 1 year warranty expires.
4,Happy with the purchase,We used the Garmin Streetpilot on a fairly short jouney to unfamiliar territory. It is simple to use and the voice guidance is also helpful. The screen display is clear. We have no complaints.
4,Great GPS unit,"Works straight out of the box. Have not done anything with the Garmin site yet. Treking is fast and mostly accurate, although the routes selected may not always be the best and the ""voice"" is reluctant to change to a better route.Would be really nice if the unit have a more pocketable form factor (more boxy)like some of the others. It can actually be used as a hand held GPS."
5,C340 is worth the extra money!!,"Purchased this Garmin GPS for my Dad for Christmas. I decided on the c340 over the c330 because of the addition of spoken street names in the c340. It makes a huge difference in the ease of use for drivers. You hear the street name said aloud as you approach a turn, instead of a just generic turn command. Therefore, much of the time you can simply listen to the GPS unit give directions and you don't hvave to look at the monitor. Spend the extra few dollars for the c340."
4,Happy Husband,"My husband said this is probably the best gift I've ever given him.We find it very helpful,& for the most part easy to use.We also like the fact that it's a portable unit & even loaned it to our son while he was in town visiting to help him navigate around the Bay Area.Now my husband never has to ""stop & ask for directions!"" (of course being a man that's against the rules.)"
3,"Great deal, Garmin did it again.","Great Garmin GPS. These units are built well and do what they are supposed to. Large color touch screen and common navigation features make it great for use in the car. Like the features and options for this as well. Graded down since it is a bit large and the software seems to hang up more than other models of Garmin GPS. I use 9 types of Garmin GPS and this one has the hardware but the software is a bit lacking. I reloaded the drivers and software version and got it more stable. Audio is loud, screen is easy to see, and touch screen works well. No problem with suction cup mounts or wiring. I do wish the power could be connected without the mount though. Overall, great unit as they are cheap and usually discounted, and can be used in rental cars. Just make sure the rental car company drone doesn't try to take this thinking you rented it from them...lol."
2,Where's the lemon?,"What happened to the lemon creme flavored tablets? Has Maalox lost their minds? I don't like the mixed flavors. I am a very particular and vindictive shopper. I could not get what I wanted so I switched to TUMS. They're harder to chew, but I am finding that they actually work a little better, even though the flavors are no better than the mixed Maalox tablets that are now available. Maalox may have lost a customer!"
2,"Gore Vidal, Washington, D.C.","Although the potential purchaser was cautioned online that this book had no dust jacket, it was still rated by the dealer as in ""very good"" condition. When the book arrived, it turned out that its spine was cracked from the very top to the very bottom, and the book was barely hanging on to its cover. That's not my idea of ""very good"" condition. Nor do I think it is the term that most reputable dealer would use."
4,Good stuff.,"Ilyce R. Glink, 100 Questions First-Time Homebuyers Should Ask (Three Rivers Press, 2000)The title of this book, perhaps, does it something of a disservice. The information to be found here is useful for anyone in the process of looking for a new home. Sure, a good deal of it will be more useful to those who haven't been through the process before (the section on different types of mortgages, and different breeds of mortgage brokers, is likely to be especially helpful), but since buying a new home isn't something one does on a weekly, or even a yearly, basis most of the time, there's stuff in here that might make for it being a good refresher course when it comes time to sell. (As well, it may remind the sellers of the state of mind of the homebuyer and invoke a little sympathy.) Much of it may seem like common sense, but let's not forget that the vast majority of humanity are notably devoid of that particular capacity.Good stuff, well worth reading. ****"
5,"Excellent Book, But Continue to Do Your Homework","Ms. Glink has put together an excellent starting point for looking for a home. I used it a lot when I began my search, and wish I'd followed some advice that I passed over."
1,What the hell is wrong with you people?!,"What are you all drones?! not only are they full of rat excrements you know for a FACT that they're a put together band. I mean alot of boy bands and rock groups are mad because other famous people call them ""put together crap"" be these hoes actually ARE put together crap. And thier single Liquid Dreams?!?!?!?! are they scared that if they actually say that they Jack off to African American women (and they're all African American wich the fact that maybe one is African American is kinda racist)while they're sleeping someone will get mad at them? And so they make a song about it?!?!?! i dont know about you guys who bought this CD, let aloneliked this CD disgust me and you should all be ashamed. For Shame, For Shame."
3,"I love the song ""BABY I WOULD""","When I first heard the song ""Baby I Would"" on the television show 'Making of the Band', I couldn't wait to buy the song on CD. It will rank up there in my favorite Slow Jams of the year. But it's too bad the best singer IKAIKA isn't on the album version. The song seems to be missing something without Ikaika's powerful vocals. I guess he didn't wan't to be part of this manufactured boy band. 'NSYNC & Backstreet Boys are much better groups. MTV's 2GETHER are even better vocally then O-TOWN. But ""BABY I WOULD"" is a very good love song and it tops any love song out of 'Black&Blue' & 'No Strings Attached'. More stars to the Ikaika version though."
5,Best Group EVER!!!,"Personally, all the songs are good. Trevor just needs some work on his voice.If you don't like this group there is something wrong with you!!"
3,This CD is OK!,"I only like Ashley and Jacob in O-town because they are the only cute guys! Well, I think the tracks of this album are OK, the better songs are: Liquid Dreams, Girl, Shy Girl, All or Nothing, Baby I would and Love is a Crime. I think 12 tracks are not enough, there should be 14! I can't get enough of the CD. But their music is pop, I can't see any 'rock' though they claim that it's a little rock, even alternative! Funny. Anyway, I think you would like this CD if you like pop boy bands like me.I live in Hong Kong and don't have MTV, so I couldn't watch Making the Band. I would like to watch it if I had a chance to."
1,Disappointed,"I brought because the cover looked good but after playing it I knew why I never hear of them, not worth it"
3,if ur lookin for tons of testosterone filled pop here ya go!,"I got this cd like a few weeks ago, geez! Most of the songs on here are about how a certain girl will make them go nuts, how they need lovin every 6 seconds and their dream girl. This will prolly send out the wrong message to girls making them think that every guys dream girl has a body like JLo, Madonna's style & Janet J's smile so that'll make their self esteem plummet. The only songs that don't send out a bad message are ""The Painter"" & ""All For Love"" I thought this CD would be a bit better since they are a gr8 group with gr8 voices!"
5,A surprising good sound,"I never thought in a million years that I'd own an O-Town CD, and I liked it! It totally surprised me. There are uptempo songs and ballads and it's a must have for any O-Town fan. This CD is kinda letting everyone know they want to be around in the music business for a long time."
1,Argh!,"What I remember most about this show (which was made in Canada) is that series creator, science fiction writer, Harlan Ellison hated this show so much he had his name taken off and replaced with ""Cordwainer Bird""."
4,FROM THE BERGERIE!!!,"UK duo Swayzak is good at what they do, producing some very clean and palatable dub, micro-house and techno dashed with a bit of electro-synth. On ""Loops From the Bergerie"", their atmospheric sounds are augmented with 80ish vocals from Richard Davis and David Brown co-member of Swayzak, giving songs like ""Keep It Coming"", ""Another Way"", ""My House"" and ""Snowblind"" an organic-David Bowie-an quality. Many may think that the vocals are unneccessary, but compared to the ""dirty"" vocals on ""Dirty Dancing"", these are a bit more aurally appealing. This clearly is not Swayzak's best material compared to ""Snowboarding in Argentina"" and ""Himawari"", but it still showcases some very fine production work from yet another outstanding duo from the ol' UK."
4,Murray Lawn Mower cutting Blade,"I have used this cutting blade for almost 2 months with no problems. This blade even cuts better than my old blade did. It has a little different design than my old blade which makes it cut better.I have a Sears rear engine riding mower. Model #536.270211. I guess Murray makes some of Sears mowers. This Murray blade fits my Sears lawn mower.I guess Sears does not carry this blade any more . So thats why I ordered it from Amazon. Amazon also has cheaper prices than Sears parts.The Murray blade is 30 1/16 inches long, 2 3/4 inches wide, and the hole is 7/8 inches. It fit my Sears mower perfect and it cuts better than my old Sears cutting blade .I bought 2 of these blades because they are better than my old Sears blade."
1,Hope you have 4 hours to spare,This is by far the worst book case or storage system I have ever assembled. We are expecting our 2nd child in a month so we have purchased several different storage items in the last month. Every other one went together with ease. The instructions are vague and after 3 hours the shelves are actually crooked and I'm not even finished.Stay away unless you want to spend 4 hours putting together a poorly made bookshelf.
4,Dollhouse/ Bookcase,"I had been looking for a fun bookcase for my 2 year old daughter Natalia's bedroom. Most are really made cheaply & not worth the money. This one is cute & has painted windows & compartments that make it fun for her. She loves it. The only thing negative is that it leans alittle on the carpet. As far as putting it together, I read the other reviews & thought I was giving my husband a problem job. As it turned out he & Natalia put it together in less than 2 hours. It also has alot of storage room."
2,"OK, but where is Chopin, where is artistry?","While this is a respectable and mostly competent recording, it is light years behind such artistic achievements as Ivo Pogorelich (DG) and Mikhail Pletnev (Virgin), just to name a few.There is nothing new in these readings, which makes the CD redundant. The Finale of the great b-flat minor Sonata reminds a Czerny Etude rather than a dry sand storm over the graves. And the Scherzi, while technically assured, bring no musical revelation or innovation. Most of it is simply too loud and fast, and the passage work sounds more like Liszt rather than Chopin. There is little elegance and grace in these performances. Just hear the best recordings of the Sonata and Scherzi and compare. Unfortunately, this EMI release does not stand much of a chance."
4,Encouraging and motivating,"Bob does a great job of helping the average reader understand their role in ministry - usher, music, etc. All are important in the body of Christ. I particularly appreciated his emphasis on QUALITY in our work."
2,Heartless,"I'm sick of these movies where everything just turns out to be in somebody's imagination.Your led to believe what your seeing is actually real,then at the end it all mostly ends up being in his mind.This movie would have been better if it was a straight up horror,rather than a psychological thriller."
5,The Absolute Best,"I first read this book when I was in the 8th grade. I loved it right away and over the years, recommended it to many friends. Now I am reading the book as a college student and I am able to read with a more adult insight. The pain and torture that Ruthie went through made me thank God that I did not have to endure the torture she and her sisters did. She was able to come from a poverty ridden background to become the woman she is today. I think Ruthie is the epitome of true inner strength. I think everyone, not just women, not just African-Americans, everyone should read this book. It is truly a rewarding experience."
4,"Frankie's rap to ""Before I Let Go""","On the album, Frankie did a short rap to the chorus of ""Before I let go."" Why doesn't the CD have the same thing? My entire Maze album collection was destroyed and I am trying to replace it with CDs. But the one song I really wanted to be like it was on the album is not on the CD. Can anyone help me?"
4,Cute but flimsy,"I bought this for a Halloween party and it's definitely a cute costume...but it's a little on the flimsy side. I tried to iron it (BIG mistake) and burned a hole in it. You can iron the dress, just on a very low heat setting. It also runs small (I'm a size 18 and the 3x/4x was a little snug) so keep that in mind when you place your order. The party I went to had other bunnies and I couldn't help but notice how the details on their costumes were a higher grade of quality (i.e. collar, ears and cuffs). Then again, I don't know how much they paid for their costumes:) For the price, you really can't go wrong. Just don't plan on keeping this one for a long time."
1,Not what I expected.,"I was very unhappy with a recent purchase from Winter Ventures, Inc. The book I ordered was advertised as used-good. It certainlly wAS USED! The back cover was torn off and taped on-tape didn't hold. Edges were torn and dirty. I will not purchas from Winter Ventures again. I will not return this book and throw good money after bad."
2,Very thin,"I purchased this crib sheet because I have previouly owned jersey knit sheets for twin size beds and thought it would be nice for our newborn. I thought it would feel more comfortable on her skin than basic crib sheets. This particular sheet does not feel like other jersey knit sheets I have owned. It does not feel soft at all. (Jersey sheets are supposed to feel soft like an old t-shirt). It is also really thin. It does fit fine on the mattress, not too tight, not too loose. I would not recommend this sheet."
4,Historically Based Information With An Emphasis On The Weird And Wacky,"""Underground Education"" does not so much offer a radical intellectual perspective, as is perhaps implied by the title. But rather is a collection of funny stories and oddball facts about various people and events from the past. Some of the historical figures are famous, such as George Washington and Cleopatra. While others, like the several female serial killers discussed, are more obscure. The book is divided into 10 chapters, including the arts, religion, science and sex. Actually, this book reminds me somewhat of the ""People's Almanac"" series written by David Wallechinsky. But here the emphasis is definitely on the strange and often perverse. It's a fun read for those interested in this sort of knowledge. But some entries are overlong and most readers will probably want to read the sections of greatest interest rather than cover to cover. Still it is a worthwhile purchase."
3,Pretty good,"It is what it is: a collection of strange and/or unseemly facts (and a few not-so-facts) about the history of nearly everything. It was an entertaining and interesting read and there was quite a bit I wasn't familiar with that is great supplemental information to my other knowledge of history. But, Zacks gets 3/5 for his obsession with sexual perversion (surely there's more interesting and unknown information in history than just weird sex acts?), for his constant negative references to some vague yet ominous entity he refers to as ""the Church"" but whose actions were perpetrated by a great variety of different groups, for repeating several times some long-dismissed myths as if they were facts, and especially for seemingly being incapable of understanding the overarching movement of history in favor of piecemeal and patchwork (in other words, for lacking aptitude for abstract thought in favor of the specific and literal). Other than that it's a pretty good book..."
5,"THINGS I NEVER KNEW, I NEVER KNEW.","I FIRST BROUGHT THIS BOOK BACK IN 1999. I DIDN'T BUY IT FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN I LIKED THE COVER! BUT MAN, ONCE I OPENED AND STARTED TO READ I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON SOME GREAT FACT OF THE WORLD TO DAY. EVERYONE MUST OWN A COPY!!!!"
5,Clear with workable instructions on talking to each other,Two copies were sent to husband and wife for their 25th Wedding Anniversary as they are still fighting unfairly and have never been instructed how easily that can happen if both want it to with the clear and consise guidance in this book.
3,good beginner video,This video was humorous but not very scary. Good for the younger set but one of the least scariest of the Goosebumps we've seen. My 9 year old daughter who scares easily loved this one.
3,Good MotoCross and Dual Sport bag,"Pros - Easy to install, I used zip cords for extra securtyWater resistance designCons - Bag could be a bit biggerA little pricey. I paid $25"
4,"Content fine, format hard to read","This has potential to be a great book; the ideas and examples are excellent. I teach introductory stats and there's more than enough here to keep everyone interested and amused. Unfortunately the book's presentation is second-rate. While pages are large the text is insufficiently enlarged, leaving wide white margins around a small, cramped text. Diagrams are smudged and hard to read. This cheap reproduction detracts from an otherwise good book."
5,dog's favorite toy,"Although our dog has an entire basket full of toys, ""Rottie"" is always the one she pulls out first! This is the 4th one I've ordered."
1,I would not reconmend it .....,the acting was very amature..I would select it as a second rate (B) D.V.DThe scenery and the general appearence of the set was very good.
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"This is positively the best Civil War Comedy ever made, sheer genius in mocking Civil War reenactors....oh....were they serious?....Has absolutely no bearing on the Battle of Gettysburg, if you're looking for a lesson in Civil War history and tactics, look elsewhere.Borders on the ridiculous with the terrain looking nothing like the battlefield (I did not realize that Little Round Top was actually a flat field!)Actors who mumble unintelligible lines, wear real pork chops for sideburns, and Halloween style uniforms, this has it ALL! Sure to make the staunchest Civil War buff to focus on another chapter of American History."
3,Average at best,"This is the kind of show where you can sum up the story in a few sentences at most, and with these 4 episodes, comes accross as rather average at best.Basically this is a story about Yui, who has little to no real life talents, she gets drawn into a music club, must get an instrument, and everything else is basically just random slice of life elements.Although I get that this series is popular, it doesn't really have much, if any depth beyond the whole moe thing that shows like Lucky Star(Also created by the same people as K-On) have.If you want a random slice of life show which apparently is deep because it has music lol, this is a show for you, however if you want something perhaps with more of a story, you might want to look elsewhere.I pretty much think of this show as Lucky Star with a musical tone."
5,Wonderful experience,Product arrived quickly and was well packaged. Product was as described and our Grandson enjoys playing with it and has learned the concept of stop.
3,"Hefty, but Specific Reference","A fine, if special purpose, reference. The first half of the book contains a cronological listing of words broken down by category (War, Interjections, Emotions, Colors). This is interesting for questions like: ""What words would a modern man of the 1590's use?"" The latter (and more specifically useful) half contains an alphabetic index of all words (but sadly indexed without date -- requiring some paging back and forth): ""Is this word appropriate for a Lady of the 1880's?"" This is the sort of reference that cries out for CD-Rom, but the flexibility of paper far outweighs the limited possibilities of some cd ui. ""Brief Musings"" about English evolution break up the index monotony and add some ""why"" rather than just what."
1,Still Waiting for Response,"I received the fruit in good time but have a problem with the mixture. It is advertised as red cherries, green cherries and pineapple. I ordered two one-pound packages of the fruit mix. Each one -pound container had no more than 3 green cherries in the entire package. I have tried twice (e-mail and fax) to contact the vendor but to date have had no response."
3,Seasons In Basilicata,"There wasn't enough about the area/history of Basilicata....tooo much about the author and his life. He detailed much about the town of ""Aliano"" and its people. The parts of Basilicata he did cover were interesting. My family came from and I spent some time in Basilicata many years ago, but could not relate to his relationships there."
2,Missed opportunity . . .,"I was attracted to this book because of my recent trips to this region. I commend the author for some of his encounters and descriptions, but I had the constant feeling when he talked about situations without involving himself. I guess this comes from not having a good command of the language. For example, he talks often of the men that gather daily in the square, yet he never seeks them out to discover their histories or conversations. I wanted to push him of his balcony. Forse troppo caffè corretto . . ."
5,Outstanding,What a good product. My mom uses it all the time.It shipped very fast and was at my door in no time.
3,Retro Fun,"This video made-for-TV remake of the original BYE BYE BIRDIE has a fresh new approach to the American musical theatre classic. It closely follows the script of the original and adds a couple of great new songs. The cast is fun - Tyne Daley is wonderful as Mrs. Peterson - and well suited for their parts. If you've only seen the original movie and never seen the staged musical, this will seem a bit different to you. But, remember, this follows the script far more closely than the original movie. Both are a fun take on the show; but, this one is closer to what you would see on a stage. Well worth the purchase."
1,Not a good re-make,"This does not deserve 4 stars, I'm guessing these are folks who never saw the original film. The actors with the exception of Jason Alexander and Ty Dailey haveno charisma and re-writing just doesn't work. I'm guessing trying to make it more palatable to younger audiences. Vanessa Williams comes across fake and forced as do most of the performances in this which is a shame because we need more musicals but maybe using unknown actors for a changemight be something for the producers to thing about."
1,"One for the book, but constellation for the author","As Hemingway the Zen master said, ""Some are hunters, some are not."" Several Hemingway scholars have treid to explain EH's lifelong affinity for blood sports (notably Bredahl and Drake's 1990 exegesis of Green Hills Of Africa) -- this ""package of Papa"" is content to just push whole chunks and raw excerpts of Hemingway onto a marketing skewer without any comment. Using ""hunting"" as a marketing criterion forces together the most flaccid posthumous Hemingway and some of his purest fiction and livliest reportage. It's obvious Hemingway wrote about hunting (and fishing) in the same sense the Homer wrote about Mediterranean tourism. Lazy readers may like the way this editor rearranged Hemingway's cabin furniture, but most of the writing actually seem the duller for being re-packaged to a less spontaneous purpose. Sad to see a great prose turned as a license for 'designer books,' and by his own kin. Some are artists, others are not."
3,great price vs other bulk outlets,"I have been using this for years, and recently found out you can also buy these on amazon! Who knew!! I used to buy these at a local BULK outlet, but found there are better selections online. I haven't had a problem with fleas with my two dogs. I would recommend this! (However, I have also not tried the other brands that have been featured.)"
1,never delivered,I ordered this item over a month ago and STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT!HOW RIDICULOUS IS THAT???I should have just bought it at the pet store.I'll never buy from them again.
3,Different packaging,The product I received seems to be an Australian import.The packaging I received referred the dog's weight in kg and might no be packaged for the US. Hope it is an authentic Merial product.
1,not Merial product,Product was advertised as Merial fronline plus. Showed up as Armor frontline . Why didnt I just go to Walmart ? false advertising!
1,Does not repel flees,"Frontline Plus kills fleas in 1-3 days but does not repel them (the company vet told me this) So if you treat your dog then take it outside again, the fleas will jump back on and then those fleas will be killed in 1-3 days. I used this several times and wondered why the fleas never disappeared. I called the company to inquire about it and they told me Frontline has no repellant qualities. How do I know it ever killed the fleas if I always see fleas? Might as well just flea-shampoo my dog once a week and save $$$$$. The TV comercials are deceiving."
2,wasn't very effective,"shipping was quick.however, I do not know why but product was not very effective.lasted maybe three weeks."
1,Frontline Plus,"I ordered this product from Fatman's Doghouse on Amazon in March of 2011 for my four dogs. Naturally I was pleased to see the price as it's gets expensive with four dogs, however, when they say ""it's too good to be true"" it usually is..by the time they were ready for their next application, one month later I found fleas on them. Ironically before I found the fleas I couldn't find the paperwork for my purchase on Amazon or I would have purchased more Frontiline Plus from Fatman's Doghouse..thank goodness I had misplaced it..later I went on-line and saw that buying outside the U.S. is not the way to go which I had no idea I was doing when I purchased this...I learned my lesson..my dogs health and well being is one of the most important things to me. I'll never use Amazon again for such a purchase."
3,"Good price, but 1 dose received damaged","I've used this vendor before, and usually everything is great. This time, one dose was broken inside the package. :("
2,Australian product passed off as American,"I bought what I thought was American, but when it came it was clearly Australian, labelled for Australia. Now I am worried about Australian standards - do they measure up to USA standards. It was not advertised as Australian!!!"
4,Older dog,Have used front line for at least 15 years on three different dogs. Always effective and easy to use. Like it fine.
4,frontline plus,"Frontline Plus is effective in preventing flea & tick infestation. Ticks will still make a home in your pet's skin but eventually die and fall off or just crawl off and latch on to you. This product, like all other topical flea/tick stuff really only lasts 3 weeks...not 4 as the manufacturer claims. I recommend it though...it's better than nothing."
3,it works for sure,"just remember it is a pesticide...if you have more than one dog, they can lick it from each other."
5,Frontlineplus,Product came as expected. New and in unopened or sealed box. Shipped faster than expected. Do not know if will work exactly as expected as we do not have all the fleas gone yet and on our second month. Hopefully it will.
5,It just works,"My dog is allergic to fleas, a few bites and he's ripping out his fur.Frontline just works to control fleas and ticks so that the fleas don't live on him and bite.Life without Frontline, at least for my dog, would be misery."
2,makes my dog sluggish when applied,"This product works well at keeping away the ticks, but it makes me nervous every time I apply it (usually just once or twice a year, when entering tick-infested areas), because my dog gets lethargic for a few days after application. I have read on the web of other people's dogs having this response, and counter-arguments that there is absolutely no reason this should happen. However, I've seen this response in my dog, and I worry that it may be an allergic response that could get worse over time, so I've stopped using this product. I'm going to try the spray-on Frontline next, as that stays on the surface of the hairs, rather than being absorbed through the skin and entering the dog's bloodstream as a systemic pesticide (the way Frontline plus is)."
3,Hard to get excited,My dog got a tick at the end of the month cycle. It is hard to state if my application was less then perfect or stuff just evaporates at the end of the cycle. At least there are no allergies noted so far.
5,The best flea and tick prevention ever.,"Frontline is the best at preventing fleas and ticks. I have two outside dogs that are always running through the woods and grass, and I have never seen a flea or tick on them since using Frontline. Each dose lasts for about 6 weeks so 1 pack provides protection throughout the entire flea and tick season."
5,Frontline Plus,Have only used for one month but it seems to be working fine. No unusual side effects noticed.
2,"Wrong product, but the Top Spot worked as intended, I guess.","I ordered this alongside another dose of Frontline Plus for my 8-year old and 3-month old beagle, respectively. It was not until after I had applied the treatment that I noticed how different the boxes were. Upon further inspection, I realized that the larger-dog dose was in fact Frontline Top Spot, and not Frontline Plus. Now, normally, I wouldn't quibble about that. But as the boxes state, Top Spot does not kill flea eggs. Two weeks have passed, and now both my dogs have fleas again. Hooray!I haven't actually complained to the seller, so no word on how they would have redressed the issue."
1,Careful; this vendor is almost charging double!,"This is not rated for the product, but this particular vendor. They are almost charging double over the avg. cost of $33 for 3 doses by several other sellers. Product is great, just not this seller!! I'm just ""paying it forward"" for what other buyers have done re: vendors charging a lot more than the avg. seller."
4,fleas are gone,It seems to work...just make sure that you get the proper dosage for your pets weight.
2,"It used to work, but I guess the flees are immune?","I was told to get Advantix or Advantage instead of Frontline, but noticed a lady at the pet store complaining that neither worked for her dog, and she has to flee bomb the poor pooch because it's got so bad.I don't know if our dog is just teething, has dry skin, or if it's really flees biting her, but the Frontline apparently seems to NOT be working as well as it used to on our other dog four years ago, which was a Labrador Retriever.I have one more months supply left, so I will up the dosage and see if that helps once I've used the last container. The flees are turning into SUPERflees, and none of this stuff seems to work like it used to."
1,DOES NOT WORK! DON'T BUY FRONTLINE PLUS!,"I would have given this no stars if I could. I have used Frontline Plus for both cats and dogs for fleas and ticks for a couple of years. Up until 2 months ago it seemed to work ok. However, the last two applications has done nothing for my pets and I now have an infestation of fleas. I called my vet's office and they told me they have found that the Frontline is not working in Maine and that Frontline has acknowledged it, but they aren't doing anything for those of us who have bought it. I now have 2 more weeks before I can apply something new and in the meantime my animals are in agony with biting fleas and I am trying everything I can think of to rid them from my house. If you are thinking about buying Frontline Plus I suggest you call your vet and ask for other options but don't buy Frontline regardless of where you live because according to people all over the country Frontline is not working."
1,Fake Frontline?,No EPA registration number to be found on box or applicators. There is an expiration date on box and applicator... there isn't supposed to be one. No lot number on box or applicator.I put whatever this is on my dog two weeks ago and she still has fleas.
5,Frontline,Great product - I never worry about fleas or ticks using this - and I live in flea infested Florida!
1,Manufacturer of this product said I received counterfeit products.,I researched this product before I bought it through ebay.I was disappointed when the items showed signs of counterfeiting.I called the manufacturer of this product - Merial- to confirm these signs. I was told by several layers of customer service that Merial does NOT put an expiration date anywhere on the packaging of this product.Merial stated that counterfeits of their products have expiration dates.Merial sent me replacement packages of the genuine product after I mailed them the counterfeits. I had to pay for the mailing...$$.BUYER BEWARE.
5,Good Product,This product has always worked well and we have used it on multiple dogs for multiple years. Never had any problems with this product.
4,Frontline Plus,I have used the first application of this Frontline Plus and it seems to be doing the job of keeping fleas & ticks away.
5,Great product!,It works well. We haven't had any problems with fleas in a summer when fleas were a real problem for many.
5,A+++,"Product arrived as quickly as can be expected, since it was coming from Australia. A++ price and quality."
1,Frontline Plus,"I've seen many tv commercials and advertisements about this product, so finally I decided to purchase it. I generally use flea collars or sprays on my chihuahua. I did not see a difference after using Frontline Plus. My dog was scratching herself more and I was very unsatisfied."
4,mine came from the UK i think...,"The one that I received is like a UK version.. its in kilograms and uses other lingo we dont use. im sure it's probably still fine.. the packaging is a bit different but its still frontline. this one says Frontline Combo.. not plus. comes with ""6 pipettes"" for dogs 2-10kg. I used it on my dog.. I'm sure it's still okay. just thought it was kind of weird."
1,I'm not happy with Frontline plus for dogs or cats,"I''ve used Frontline for several months now and it doesn't seem to work at all! Yes the fleas appear to be dying slowly, however the entire month they continue to itch, and I have to constantly be pulling off fleas from my pets. I will never waste money on this company again!"
1,NOT WORTH THE RISK!,"Do not be mislead by the familiar package pictured. Scroll down to read the description. I received an envelope with 2 large dosages not labeled, no safety or product disclosures, a syringe, a broken glass vial and a half sheet of paper titled ""idiot"" instruction. May be counterfeit as my dogs had a very different reaction than when I use the actual Frontline in the proper dosage package. I find the advertisement misleading & the manner of distribution unethical and potentially unsafe. Research online reports regarding this potentially harmful method of dispensing, differences in dosage packages, and changes to product once opened and stored. The Seller replied to me with repeated horrible emails of insults, attacks and demands. If you take the risk, pray you never have to deal with the Seller. Not worth the savings or the risk for our four legged friends."
5,Fleas don't visit my pets anymore.,"Ever since I have been using Frontline Plus, I have never had to fleabomb my house again. We have been here over 20 years, and have had indoor/outdoor cats and dogs through out all those years. The first year we used Frontline was the first year we stopped having to fight fleas. It's probably been 7+ years now. I can't imagine our lives without it."
1,Frontline Plus Danger +Seizures,"I just want to warn everyone who uses this product that I personally believe that it caused seizures in my 7 year old Boston Terrier. One day after Frontline Plus was applied she suffered a seizure. After the seizure happened, I tried to think what she may have come in contact with that could have caused the seizure. After doing a Google search of ""Frontline Plus"" +seizure"" I found numerous pet owners who believed this pesticide caused seizures in their pets. Please do the same Google search before you continue to give this product to your pet! My dog had one more seizure 22 days later and since that time has been seizure free."
2,Cooperative but poor shipping quality assurance,"It took two extra phone calls to get the complete order correct. I placed an order for for two six packs, but they sent one order with two 3 packs and another two orders of one 3 pack each after I notified company of shipping error. On the positive side company was apologetic for error and very quick to correct the deficiency."
1,Defective Frontline,I have ordered Frontline for years with excellent results. This is the first time it has not worked-I have fleas all over my house that I cannot get rid of. I feel there was something defective with the product this time. I don't know if it had expired since there was no expiration date-but the product did not work. I am very upset & will not order from this seller again.
2,Frontline Plus Flea.,Frontline Plus Flea does not work on my dogs. I can still see fleas all over their body.
3,Frontline Plus,This product is not as effective as I had hope it would. My dog is stilling itchingfrom flea bites..
4,it works,I have tried many products and this one works. Simply apply it once a month and it kills most of the fleas on my poor suffering dog. He is happier and I am happier.
3,Frontline effectiveness,I have a German Shepherd Dog. Frontline seemed to control most but not all the fleas. Maybe it was just a bad year for fleas.
4,Great customer service,"I recently purchased a 6-unit package of Frontline Plus from Bargain 123. Three of the pipets had ruptured in transit, which was no fault of Bargain 123. I explained the situation to Bargain 123 and they promptly provided a return authorization and processed credit to my Visa account. I would have given Bargain 123 a 5-star rating if the package arrived as expected, still I was very pleased with the customer service provided and will definately consider doing business with this vendor in the future."
2,Okay Frontline,"I've bought this brand from the vet before and noticed an improvement in my dog. So, I've been putting off buying it again since its pricy. I had to recently give in and buy it because my dog is itching like crazy. Well, its been a few days, and he's still itching like crazy. This is the first time I've bought Frontline online and its the first time that it doesn't seem to be working!!! I have a smaller dog, usually one drop does the job. I've put 3 drops now since it isn't having an effect. I dont know if this stuff is old, and the ingredients aren't active. I'm really disappointed! Save your money. Im not buying this again :("
1,Too many ticks,"I ordered frontline from amazon. It came in a ziploc bag as opposed to the regular box. A week after application I plucked 10 ticks off my dog! You do the math, something isn't right."
4,Did NOT Expect the Staining,"I have 2 Miniature Poodles:one parti-color and one white. (I buy the larger weight and apply half a vial to each dog) The products purpose ---YES --it works, quite well. But my white poodle got an enormous stain on her back, where applied. Of course I waited to apply to a freshly groomed and trimmed little dog----EWWWWW!!"
5,fast shipping,I've been using this product for years and glad to have found a place to buy it that is more economical plus fast shipping.
1,Frontline Plus has Changed ?,"I have used this for years without a problem, but I believe that they have changed the formula, because it quit working a few months ago when I bought my new batch. My vet said that they have gotten a lot of similar complaints, and that long time users have switched to other products. I am now using Advantix which works great, and also is supposed to repel mosquitoes, but there have been some cases where Advantix causes a skin reaction in some dogs, so you might want to try a single dose before buying an entire package.I wonder if these mail order purchases are old stock from before a possible formula change."
2,BAD CHOICE,Tried Frontline after using Advantage for years(something different)and what a mistake. Even after 3 treatments my dog is still biting and scratching!!! Called Frontline hotline and told them about it and all they would say is there is nothing wrong with their product and that there was nothing that they would/could do!!! Should have stayed with ADVANTAGE.....usually done biting and scratching within 12-24hrs!!!!
2,Fast delivery but poor quality,"The delivery was fast, but one of packages were torn off. It was basically completely open."
1,Complete and TOTAL fail.,"Applied Frontline Plus to my dog on 9/10/10. A full 7 days later I was still picking fleas off of him. I mean these things were STILL in FULL EFFECT. NOT EVEN REMOTELY PHASED BY FRONTLINE. I took him into the vet on Day #8, our vet told us that we were about the sixth case she's seen this year that Frontline did not work for at all. Apparently, fleas have evolved PAST Frontline's formula? I plan on calling Frontline and shipping them the remainder of the product for a refund. Our vet recommended and applied Revolution for us, fingers crossed that this works."
4,does what it's supposed to,Keeps the fleas and ticks off my shih tzu. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that she has a reaction resulting in a little diarrhea every time. Only lasts for a day so it's not a huge deal.
5,Frontline Plus Dog,"We have a puppy that goes outside to do her business. I noticed that she was scratching and biting so I looked at her a little bit closer and saw one of those evil little buggers running across her belly. I ordered the frontline and put it on her as soon as the driver dropped it at the door. A day later and she is scratching significantly less and I haven't seen one on her since. It has been 3 weeks since that time.I would definitly recommend this product to keep your dog safe from fleas, ticks and the diseases they carry."
5,Best price ever for the best product ever!,"I have been using this product for nearly 5 years on my Beagle and it is by far the most reliable product i've ever used. She had fleas once when she was a puppy and we immidiatley treated her w/ front line plus. the fleas were gone almost immediatley! We use the product year round and i've never seen a flea since. We ordered from 1800 pet meds prior to this, thinking we were getting a deal, but for a pack of 3 it's about [...]! So, basically, i am getting an extra 3 doses for [...] bucks! Rock on Amazon!"
5,Works great!!,"We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue. Never seen a single flea or tick on them. I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand, and I haven't had any problems. Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs. BIG mistake. We pulled off several ticks. As soon as we could, we went right back to FP and haven't looked back. It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas, ticks and all the other nasties out there."
2,No longer effective,After ordering Frontline we discovered it is no longer effective. Guess fleas have become immune. We're trying Comfortis and hope it does the job. May try Frontline Plus for ticks.
2,Nothing is more frustrating than FLEAS....,"At first it seemed to be working. It seemed to get rid of the fleas. None to be found after a few days. Whoo Hoo! But then after the first 10 days, they were back. I thought the eggs must have hatched that were in the house and they too will be gone after they bite the dog... nope. The fleas seem to be worse now than before. (not that frontline made them WORSE) But the effectiveness seemed to wear off after about 10 days! That is a huge cost for just a few days coverage. :( I groom, raise dogs and do rescue work.... It cost a small fortune to get frontline for everyone and now seems like it was a waste. I have doses for one more round... hope it does better this time."
5,Excellent Product,I have used this product for years with my dogs and it works well. The price through Amazon was excellent and the response time also excellent.
2,"Works for ticks, but not fleas","I live in an area with fleas and ticks. Frontline helped with the ticks, but both of my dogs had fleas for the two months I used this product. Just switched to Comfortis and the fleas are gone."
3,Australian Import - different packaging,I would have liked to be advised before I bought this that it was an Australian import. I would probably still have bought it but now I feel cheated that they sent me something that is packaged differently and I'm wondering if they are cheating me in any other ways too.
3,Took a few tries to get rid of fleas,"All of a sudden my dog developed a flea problem so we turned to Frontline. The box said it would get rid of fleas within a few days, but I noticed bites and a few fleas on her for several weeks, even after a second application. I think it will take a while for the fleas to go away completely, but I honestly don't think there is a more effective product than this on the market."
1,NO LONGER WORKS!,I have been using Frontline Plus on my dogs for the last 9 years. But when I purchased this box of Frontline Plus it did not control any fleas at all. My doggies are covered in fleas and they are scratching and licking themselves raw! It is so bad they are having to wear e-collars. I really don't know which product to use now since Frontline Plus is the LEAST TOXIC of all the flea medications on the market today. I called Frontline and asked if they had changed their formula but the customer service rep said they hadn't. I told her I thought I had received a bad box because it had always worked in the past. She didn't seem to care! So I returned the unused tubes. I will not longer recommend or purchase Frontline plus ever again!
1,False advertising,I ordered this product for my dogs and it had said the product was frontline plus. When I got my package it said I had ordered the older version front line I will not buy from this company again.
1,This product sucks!,"My dog has been on this products for close 2 years. This year the weather is hot and cold. He got to go doggy parks a lot. My daughter washed my dog charlie hair and get him a hair cut. There were many fleas running all over his body. She thought perhaps I forgot to put Frontline Plus on him. Actually, I've put it on every 1th of month. She put another one on 9/8. Still yesterday I saw more fleas and I was getting bites all over my ankles as well. What a stupid product! It was just a $$$ suckers! Never works! I'd to go out buy flea shampoo and flea spread. My friend told me K9 Advantix work better! I hope that is not another money sucker product!"
1,No expiration date visible on box.,I just received a box of this from Amazon. I can't find an expiration date anywhere on the box. They have a label over part of it. So now I am nervous that they may be covering up a too soon or already expired date. How do you contact Amazon and ask about your purchase?
1,it is supposed to work right?,"I purchased the Frontline Plus because for some reason I was under the impression that it was the best flea preventative on the market. So far I have used 2 months worth of the product with no results. My dog still scratches frequently throughout the day and night. I will give him a bath, apply the monthly dosage of Frontline Plus and he will continue to scratch at fleas the entire month. I want a refund!"
1,Never received it!,I ordered Frontline Flea medicine and I never received product.I called company and they told me it had been delivered but . . . I never received it. It was either delivered to wrong address or taken from my mailbox. The company basically said too bad.
4,"Works, but could work better","I just wish it repelled the buggers, not just killed them after they bit. Not very safe in tick town."
5,"On-time, as advertised.","I received this product as advertised and in a timely manner. It came as two 3-month supply boxes instead of one 6-month supply box, but all boxes were sealed and well within expiration. I will definitely come back to this supplier for refills in 6 months!"
2,Frontline Plus for Dogs,"I have been putting Frontline on my cats and dog for years and swore by it, however, after two applications the last batch of Frontline did not eradicate the fleas from my dog this season. I am so disapointed. Now I will have to find another product that worked as well as Frontline did."
3,frontline,"I have a large dog. After 2 doses, she is still scratching a great deal. We do spend a lot of time in the woods. Maybe after the 3rd dose, it will subside."
2,Difficult to follow,"I was disappointed in this book. Although the authors obviously have a solid grasp of Delphi, they do not convey that knowledge effectively. The examples are very limited, and are not explained well enough to allow the reader to adapt them to his needs. Additionally, large chunks (10-15 pages at a time) of the book are devoted to unexplained code snippets, which do not do much to help the reader understand Delphi."
4,"it will be the best delphi book, once they re-print it","this is some HUGE amount of information; useful information. Even when you're reading the novice/beginers chapters (only 3 out of 35), you discover very practical tips and tricks.there are some chapters on the cd, and at first that seems inconvinient, but come to think of it, those are the least interesting or advanced chapters, so it's not a really big problem. it would have been nicer though if it came on too volumes."
1,Poor Quality,"Quality was really bad on the battery. It worked OK for 2 weeks, then it has to be charged everyday and is good for one phone call only."
1,"I've been ""had!""","I was looking for a Motorola telephone battery to replace a 3-year old battery that no longer held a charge for over 24 hours. I decided to buy from this seller because they had good reviews, and I assumed that spending a little bit more with them (rather than other Amazon sellers who offered the same battery for less money) would ensure a better quality battery. Boy, was I wrong! This ""new"" battery hold less power than the one I was replacing! Now I need to charge the battery after only 12 hours. What a rip-off! I'll never buy from them again."
4,Not exactly the item but close enough...,I bought this item a few weeks ago and it works great!!! The only thing that didn't satisfy me about this product is that the description was not 100% true... Nevertheless... A good product at a great price from a decent seller!
1,Battery was dead,"Purchased this battery and it would not take a charge, they sent another battery and it also would not take a charge. They are suppose to refund money but am not sure if they have at this time."
1,Original Motorola K1m Li-Ion Standard Battery [OEM] BT50 / SNN5771 /SNN5766 Compatible with Motorola: A1200 / MING C290 C975 C,"I ordered the wrong battery so I sent it back, and I am still waiting for the replacement."
1,Shady Seller...,"The battery I received is not new...I thought I was buying a new battery but instead received a battery that is in no better condition than the one I am replacing. Now to be fair I went back and looked and it doesn't actually say ""New"" in the description, but it doesn't say ""Used"" either. The picture is of a new battery and describing it as ""Original"" leads people to believe they are receiving a new, original OEM replacement part. This is not the case. I called the customer service number and its an answering machine asking for your name, order number, and detailed description of why you are calling. I somehow get the feeling they get a lot of calls complaining about this so they use this as a screening method. This seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon. My recommendation...DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!"
1,I am looking for a new battery again...,The battery came on time.The new battery gets discharged (on standby) faster and I have to charge it every day.My old battery has more standby time than this one.
1,Waste of Money,"I ordered the BT50 battery and was sent the BT51 instead. Both are compatible with my phone so I let that go. The battery lasted less than 2 weeks before it would not hold a charge at all. The battery is so poor that the phone often shuts off when a call is received, and that's with the phone plugged into the wall! The phone will not operate at all unless plugged in. If you need a reliable battery I recommend you shop elsewhere."
3,It's OK,This battery is OK. It doesn't hold a charge much longer than the one it replaced - about a day. You get what you pay for.
1,Bad battery!,This battery was cheap for obvious reasons. It would not hold a charge any longer that the worn out battery it was bought to replace. A nice way to blow out some obsolete inventory at the buyer's expense.
1,Not recommended,"Bought this battery and was defective. The charge only lasted for about 10 minutes. Do not bother, a waste of time."
5,Great Buy!!,"I was skeptical at first about ordering a battery that normally sells for $40-$50 for $3.35...But then I thought ""Why not?""...It's great!...Works just like the old battery did when we first bought the phone!...I will definetly be ordering from this site again!"
1,battery life,"Delivery was prompt and item was well packaged. BUT, the battery is no better than the old one I just disposed. It does not hold a charge for long - it is not like a new battery."
3,Replacable cell phone battery,"At first, I didn't know how to use the cell phone battery when I received it, even though the original battery I have is quickly becoming defective day-by-day. I've had my cell phone for like 2+ yrs. already, and the phone is getting old. Not to mention that I drop it occasionally. But once I asked a friend that the new battery isn't working and she asked me if I've charged it yet after I replaced the old one in the phone and I know that I haven't, I realized my mistake. It's been working fine ever since. I don't have to worry that my phone will have ""power low"" close to the end of the day, even though I charge it every night before going to bed for at least 8 hrs."
1,unable to charge,"I bought the battery for a replacement for my mom's phone. I bought a new one and it was definitely not new. It had dust and dirt on it like it had been used and when i tried to plug the phone in for charging it said that it could not charge and that it was an ""incompatible battery"" which it wasn't because it was exactly like the old one. Not to mention the shipping problems i had getting it to my house. When it arrived in the mailbox it said on the package that an additional 20 cents was needed for shipping. We weighed the package here and it was 1.1 ounce which means that you can't just put 44 cents on it and mail it. You do actually have to pay for the extra. The seller is not weighing their packages before shipping. I was fine with the extra 20 cents in shipping, until I found out the product didn't even work. overall i wasted time and money. period."
2,"right battery, didn't work in my phone",I bought this as a replacement battery for my cellphone. It was the right battery and was supposed to work for my phone type. However it didn't. Upon emailing the company they said it didn't work for my cell phone's provider changes to the phone. They did refund my money and didn't require I send back the battery. I donated it to the cell phone donation box. Well since my cell phone provider is the biggest cell phone provider it would have been nice if that was stated in their description. I broke down and went to the provider store. It turns out the battery had a recall and replaced the battery free of charge. Score one for the provider.
2,Disappointing,"My original phone batteries would hold a charge, with normal use, for about 5 to 7 days. After a couple years that was down to 2 days, so I bought two of these batteries (two phones in the household). They are no better than the old ones I took out - they hold a charge about 2 days (that is with an average of only 10 to 20 minutes of talking). I hate the thoughts of paying $30 for a new battery (and won't), but these are very disappointing - if they are ""new"", they must be factory rejects."
3,So-so battery,"Delivery was in a timely fashion. I recharge every 3 to 4 days, which is an improvement over every other day that I was doing. I was hoping for the battery lasting closer to a week before recharging. It is a bargain for the price."
5,Battery works like it should!,The battery works just like it should. Great to find a company that doesn't overcharge for the product!
5,Good degree wheel,Good size - is located in a motor compartment and doesn't disturb (but to everyone individually). In my opinion for a universal choice optimum.
1,Long-Term Usage PROBLEMS,My father has used this product for 30 years and now has problems with his nervous system and stomach. I am now caring for him and I discovered that these are long-term lead associated symptoms. He also smells extremely bad from the sulpher in the product. I have to soak his shirts for 24 hours before laundrying. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT
4,The rarest Stax LP,"Only 5000 copies of this special promo LP were pressed in 1967 and distributed to the US radios. It is nowadays the rarest original Stax LP. All the tracks on it have been reissued on various CDs and even two of the announcements (Otis Redding's and Sam & Dave's). The longest and most interesting announcement is the Stax Staff one, just before Soul Sanction by Booker T. & The MG's. It is a discussion in the Stax studio between Sam Moore, Dave Prater, Steve Cropper, Booker T. Jones, Donald Dunn, Al Jackson Jr, David Porter and Deanie Parker about the necessity of getting a high school diploma.An historic record, with even a letter from the vice-president of the US on the back and a great cover with the ""Soulsville USA"" letters on the studio's marquee specially changed to ""Stay in school, don't be a drop out"" for the photo.See more at http://staxrecords.free.fr/stayinschool.htm"
5,Another Gem from Mr. Adams,"No matter what mood I'm in, no matter what crisis has befallen me, I can always depend on Dilbert to make the load a little lighter, the outlook a little brighter."
4,Good Times,"The Ziggens have created their very own genre of music. This disc is made up of smooth riffs and a little steel guitar. For any one in the midwest they are similar in style to the Gear Daddies. That those lighthearted lyrics,and are a good party favorate."
3,"It's ok, but not what expected","The level looks sturdy and works fine, the tripod is useful addition.However, the description was not clear enough, I think. It says there is laser chalk line and a beam splitter to 90 degrees reference. I expected having two perpendicular laser chalk lines.But the line can be seen only if you use that head, if you use the splitter, there are only two tiny dots projected, no lines.You can't use the chalk line an the splitter together and because that's what I need I returned the product.I have no big experience with the laser levels, so it was also surprising how relatively wide is the laser chalk line, it's not enough precise for my purposes, there are several millimeters tolerance in t.Otherwise it seems ok."
5,Great book on Domino and the Java,"Great Book! Well written. I am a good Java programmer, but I am new to notes.There were things I could not do in LotusScript. This book got me up to speed on the Java NOI in no time flat. The protoype is done and the project has been approved. Thanks Bob.--Richard"
4,Great Book,This book is a great book for those that want to learn the language of java. Beginners to Advanced people will find this book helpful to them.It offers great insights on the language of java and it also helps beginners that want to learn it. If you are eager in learning more in the computer field this book is for you.
4,"Big Voice, Big Heart","Bruce ""Sunpie"" Barnes is an ex-NFL football player who went on to front a high-energy zydeco band that does an excellent job of blending zydeco, blues, and even a little jazz (their cover of Herbie Mann's ""Memphis Underground"" is a hoot!) into a mighty tasty gumbo. Sunpie has a big voice and a big heart, both of which are shown off to advantage in this recording. Let the good times roll!"
5,The best of therapy in a book!,"Toxic Parents is wonderful and extremely useful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the second half of the book in particular. Susan Forward has written and explained various techniques to help you re-gain control of your life. There are that many techniques and activities that I doubt you wouldn't be able to find one that works for you.I found the book 'Controlling Parents' by Dan Neuharth to be better at explaining the different types of control and more about the insides to the problem, whereas this book I found to not be as in depth in that area. I just found that this book helped tremendously in regards to its therapy techniques.Overall, both books work extremely well hand in hand. I recommend them both, regardless of whether you are in therapy yourself or not. There is a lot you will learn and come to understand and ways in which you can help yourself regain control of your life and independence."
3,Well-Meaning Advice,"I read this book ten years ago, when it came out in hardback. This is a good book in the aspect that tells the reader that he/she is not alone in dealing with abusive parents. One of the exercises in Toxic Parents suggests that you talk to the less intimidating of your parents. So, I tried to talk to my mother. She blew me off. At the time, I was very upset and disappointed with this book's advice, which obviously failed. Or, perhaps it was my approach. At any rate, I learned that everybody has their own style and pace in dealing with dysfunctional behavior. Another warning: some of the stories may stir up strong emotions."
5,This book is amazingly helpful,"I just finished reading, and working through the exercises in, this book. I still have a long road ahead of me, but I have a solid foundation to build on in my healing.About the review entitled : Blame mommy and daddy-- Guess what? Abusive and neglectful parents do have a huge impact on their children that lasts; it changes who the child is at a deep level, and, without help, taints everything in the child's life, right up through adulthood. Parent's ARE responsible for the abuse/neglect of their children, and the impact it has on their children's lives. These children were innocent. The adult child has the responsibility to have the courage to see the truth, do what it takes to heal, and make sure they don't reenact the same patterns with their own children, partners, and other loved ones."
4,Worthwhile-read,Well-structured and helpful book. Author provides good insight into how parents influence our development.
5,This is a must read for all people,"No family is perfect, and this book offers insight to dysfunction. Easy read with clear examples of parental behavior and how to overcome the damage. This book gives the first step to understanding frustrations that are underlying in family hierarchy. Toxic parents help me understand my relationships with others and my role as a child of alcoholism."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Once upon a time booksellers were perceived as honorable, their profession a noble one. One could purchase a book with some confidence in obtaining something worthwhile for the money spent. Tsk.Tsk. It appears booksellers have fallen into league with the scam artists. I was deeply disappointed to discover that any serious, reputable bookseller would carry such titles as this. The first thing you learn in Mr. Thomas' book is that it is NOT ""the complete guide"" as in the very introduction he refers to the ""other materials you received"" with the book and touts it as a 'Home Study Course'. He then assures the reader of what an honest fellow he is, claiming he doesn't know any other way to be. But, myself, I would have to question the 'honesty' of selling as a ""book"" something that clearly is not, and promising to teach when all he really wants to do is make a lot of money on this 'book' and maybe sell you a few more 'products' of his own creation."
3,bill bruford,"this is not your typical bill bruford album. But if your into a sort of jazz, prog, rock fusion thing, this is good stuff."
5,"Great CD, but get the 2008 Japan remaster","This is a great CD. However, the original CD is tinny and the BGO 2003 import remaster sounds shrill and like it was just the original CD re-EQ'ed. The EMI Japan remaster from 2008 is the one to get. It has great remastered sound that is not brickwalled and clearly beats the other versions and is well worth the extra cash if you love this album."
5,Freeze-Frame,"This is my personal, best album of all time .... and I know it has to be some ones personal favourite, but sit back, grab a beer and PLAY IT LOUD! ... Here in the U.K, The J Geils Band must have been the most undernoticed Superband of the 80's. (Obviously apart from the Number 1 track - Centerfold). This is NOT an album you will be disappointed with."
2,Quick question,"I just received a package of this product centric 105.034 posi-Quiet ceramic brake pad with shims... but I am confused, first because I was thinking it was the kit. 2nd. Would I be able to know if this order that I made is for the forward wheels or back wheels? because I need the back ones, in case that they are diferent that I need, would you be able to change it?I really appreciate it. thank you/"
3,You have to know what you are doing.,"Many of the dance videos are too basic. This one may err the other way. I had taken a Salsa class, so thought I could move to levels three and four. I was wrong. I'll see what happens when I go back to the first tape which has levels I & II. Although they do go through the steps slowly, one time, because there are so many combinations, it requires multiple replays for me to get the hang of it. I would much prefer to have seen them break down the steps one at a time rather than doing the whole combination. I'll check back in after trying the more basic steps."
1,I hate This Movie it makes me wanna like Part 1!,"SUMMARY: Film Students are making a movie called Urban Legends, and when they start working, they all start getting killed off one by one.IN MY OPINION: I HATED THIS MOVIE! This movie rips off alot of horror movies such as Scream 3. This is John Ottman's debut and in my opinion he ruined his career with this peice of junk. I liked the original, I thought it was awesome, but this movie talks about making a horror movie instead of Urban Legends. Oh yeah, I don't mean to spoil it for you guys who are gonna watch it, but this is a movie in a movie which is so stupid. Oh yeah, and Jennifer Morrison sucks in her role, but there is good acting. But either way the movie is not good.OVERALL: I warn you, if your still gonna watch it. Some people do like this movie, and you might too, but if your a horror movie lover, you'd be disapointed with the horrifyingly bad sequel to the B+ original.Sincerly,J."
3,Not horrible but not the best ever,"Ok,the sequal to Urban Legend wasn't that bad,but it was most definatly not better than the first one.The sequal had it's moments of being good.There were only a few,but that's better than none at all.My main complaint is,they didn't use ANY yrban legend based killings.They talked about them a whole lot,but there was no imaginative type killings like there were in the first one.The movie is called URBAN LEGEND:FINAL CUT,so why didn't the writer use them?Second,the ending was just down right stupid.If you are going to have an ending that leaves your film open for a sequal,at least make it good.Third,where were the other survivors from the first movie?Third,there were lots of places where the movie just felt like it was going on way too long.I didn't hate this movie.I did think there were some parts where it got a little suspencful and the performances weren't too bad.All in all rent this if it's a five night rental at blockbuster."
2,PSHHHHHH,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO AS GOOD AS THE 1998 ORIGINAL ONE. THIS MOVIE IS A REALLY BAD SEQUEL AND I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP, NOT EVEN SCARY, BORING, AND EXACT PLOT AS SCREAM 3! I GIVE IT 2 STARS MOVIEWISE BUT THE EXTRAS LIFT THIS UP A SMALL NOTCH. NOT A HORRIBLE DVD, BUT NOT GOOD EITHER, IT'S JUST ABOUT OK, THE MOVIE ITSELF IS UNDER OK."
1,"Entertaining, but not in a scary way","This movie was awful. One of my friends called me up and asked me to pick up a movie. I thought she said pick up a funny or scary movie. So I picked Urban Legends thinking that this would be a good horror flick. She actually said pick a funny movie like ""scary movie,"" the hilarious spinoff of scary movies. Well turns out she got what we wanted because Urban legends-Final Cut was a pretty funny movie to watch. We spent most of the time laughing at the stupid characters and weak plot then hiding our faces behind pillows. Probably not worth watching if you want to see a good horror flick."
2,Final Cut??,"Being the sequel to Urban Legends, we expect alot from this movie. I actually give it 2 1/2 stars for I have seen sequels that were much worse than this one. This version takes place at a film school university. With the best film award at stake, and a murder taking place ( the person who was most likely to win ), everyone becomes a suspect. But now no one is safe. There is some gore which adds to the movie and some suspense. Overall, not a boring movie like many other movies I've seen. It's worth watching if you are a fan of the original Urban Legends."
1,The Dumbest Movie Of All Time! Doesn't Deserve One Star!,"No good acting, terrible direction, no thrills, not one supsense scene, and was the most absolutely easiest horror film to figure out the killer. It was too obvious filled with no good stars and no good performances. Jennifer Morrison is not even that hot! And that guy she bangs looks like a NSYNC back up dancer wannabe that came out of the gutter. This is the most stupidest movie in the entire world! There should a hall for stupid movies and this would be number one!"
1,Cut it out....,"I loved UL1 and therefore was very psyched for the sequel. However, the sequel was a complete, incomprehensible, boring, predictable, nonsensical, piece of crap. The acting was bad. The characters were total sterotypes. The identity of the killer made no sense. And that stupid mask thing he wore, was soooo lame. The 'movie within a movie' thing has been done before, and done much better. I totally hated this film, avoid it at all costs."
5,horror,forgot who was in it but I remember know poor girl in that tub of ice if she could have made it out the window
5,A Must Have,If your a Monty Python fan you must have this one. You get to know the members of Python and how they met and worked together. Also the interviews with Graham Chapman are wonderful. A delight to watch.
3,Not a great lens,"I don't know if I have a poor copy of this lens or what but I'm not crazy about the image quality it makes - even when stopped down. I'm looking for a better wide lens. It is possible to get good sharp images from this lens, but many images are ""soft"" from it."
3,Starter kit,"This lens is only good if you lost all your other lenses. this is my last resort lens that can with the camera. Although i have taken some great pics with, i hardly ever use it."
2,If it wasnt for the buckle than it would be a 5-star rating,Great apron except for the buckle breaking after only using for a month... Probably wouldnt of happened if it was still made in the USA.
4,Interesting read.,"Along with her other book ""Garlic & Sapphires"" we non-pros get to see what life is like as a famous food writer with interesting anecdotes. I was pleased to get the impression that her power didn't seem to go to her head & found the author very down to earth in her perspective on food."
3,Moderately entertaining,"The book is interesting in places, boring in others - she is not a person you easily like. Her experiences in restaurants were the most interesting parts - the rest....zzzzzz."
1,Not what was expected.,"My wife reads Dianne Chamberlain novels and ordered this book (written by Dianne K. Chamberlain) by mistake, I believe that Amazon abetted the confusion by grouping this book with some written by Dianne (sans K.) Chamberlain."
5,We love Dragon!,I purchased this book for my almost 5 year old daughter. She can't get enough of Dragon. Dav Pilkey is my hero..he has created such a lovable and endearing character. And the illustrations are adorable. I highly recommend this book and any others in this series.
4,Complete & Understandable Pharmacy Tech Exam Review,"This is an excellent review for the pharmacy technician certification exam. It is comprehensive, organized, and understandable. The topics covered in this book follow closely the topics covered on the PTCB exam. This book has plenty of sample tests and a lengthy math review as well. However, it is a little weak on drug information (generic names, drug class, etc.) and pharmacy law. Overall, this is a highly recommended review book for the PTCB exam."
2,does not prepare well,"i bought this book to study for the national cpht exam ... i studied it well for over 2 months only to be shocked on test day. i was prepared mathematically (something this book does well) but the pharmacology questions (ie: what is the generic name for drug x?) were NOT sufficiently covered - they are simply listed in a read-it-if-you-can 10 page chunk. seeing as how those were the basis of the test, i was very upset with this book. if it had an extra chapter or two dealing solely with drugs themselves, it would be a good buy. for now, buy something else."
3,Okay as a starting point for certification prep.,"This book was okay to use as a starting reference, but there are better study guides. I found several typos throughout the text. Some of the numbers on the answer guide page did not match the corresponding numbers on the test page. One page had several questions missing, though the answer page had the answers! Some of the problems regarding mathematics could have been done with perhaps a little more clarity."
4,Nylon 60-CD Case,"The inner plastic box holding the CD slots is durable. It holds the full jewel cases, not just the slim cases. It also has eight slots for the chubby CD cases in which companies put box sets. The nylon outer fabric is durable. The zippers seem sturdy. My only complaint--and this seems to be the case with most CD carrying cases--is that the lid flap opens and closes from side to side instead of opening at the bottom and being able to lift the flap toward the top. I also wasn't able to squeeze the plastic clamp mechanism hard enough to get the longer strap on the case, but there is also a short nylon handle on it, so that is not an important thing."
5,Just what I needed,"These cases are great! I was moving and didn't want to part with all of my old CDs and their cases. I needed a storage case that took up minimal room and fit the CD case and this one is fantastic! Very sturdy, hard plastic body protects the CDs."
5,5 Stars and Beyond,"This is an excellent album. This is hard rock with excellent sound quality and production. Ron Nevison should have won a grammy for producer of the year for this. Ann and Nancy, Mark Andes, Howard Leese, and Denny Carmassi are all at their best on this album. The sound is clean and crisp with hard driving guitar rythyms,drums, and great synthesizers making it an 80's classic. There's The Girl, Alone, Want You So Bad are my favorites off this album. I feel Heart was at their creative peak when they made this album."
4,Jimmy Carter is a better human being than you are.,"Frankly, I was too preoccupied with college, family, and postgraduate work to pay much attention to politics during the Carter presidency, so I believed the conservative pundits who portrayed Mr. Carter as a ""failed president"" and an intellectual lightweight. This book proves me to be way off base, as Mr. Carter's honesty, wisdom,integrity, self-effacing good humor, and deeply abiding faith shine through each and every page. To Mr. Carter, Faith implies Action - and it is remarkably refreshing to realize that this ex-President is fully and actively engaged in real life, i.e., teaching Sunday school, mowing the church lawn, hammering nails for Habitat, etc. Lots of down-home, country Christianity here - and while this is not a theology text, I'd bet that there's more practical wisdom than you'd find in, say, 4 or 5 of those. This book works well as a daily devotional, at the bedside, or (as I used it) as a Sunday school text."
5,Must have book for all Christian singles!!,"When a friend lent me this book, I couldn't put it down!! As page after page I read Ms. Eliot's words reflect what my heart and soul had been going through, I knew God had put this book in my hand! I had to buy my own copy, and then I bought copies for friends. In fact I often find myself reccommending this book while in casual conversation. This book changed my life, however, it was hard for me toward the end when she pointed out mistakes women often make, and I kept hitting my head---I'd made the same one's she talked about over and over! It seemed as if she had been following me all of my dating life to write this book--and as I have discussed it with friends I find that they feel the same.I am a 24 year single mother, if I could apply her words to my life, you can too!"
4,Passion and Purity-good insight,"For those of you frustrated with today's dating arena, this book gives good insight(both biblical and practical) that encourages the reader to ""surrender"" and let God work in this area. Though, all may not agree with her advice for today's dating scene, I think there is much wisdom to be gained. A must read for all Christian women (and men would benefit also)."
5,This is by far the best book I have ever read...,"This book has opened my heart and helped me to look inside and examine what I am really thinking to see if I am following God or following my own desires. Elisabeth Elliot tells it like it is and that will offend some people. Most people don't like to actually look at what is in the darkness of their hearts - but I highly recommend this book for those who are brave enough to do so! This book has inspired me to pour out my true feelings into my journal and has helped me see what the will of God is my love life. It has honestly helped me through a very tough time when I could have acted like a little brat, demanding that my needs be fulfilled. Instead, because of this book, I have a peaceful heart."
2,contradictory?,My one question is basically... how come the author sets out guidelines that apparently (unless i misread the thing) SHE DIDN'T FOLLOW?!! I mean she says to avoid going to places alone... and avoid situations where it would be only the two of you. But then she goes around and tells a story of how she and jim were alone. (?) and then she follows it up that if she wasn't filled with the Holy Spirit it would have been hard. (hello?)
2,Author uses some of own advice,"The author of this book has over 20 Listmania lists, so this book title kept popping up and I purchased it. Unfortunately, the book needs edited badly, basics like ""periods"" were missing, making it difficult to follow. It does have good basic advice if you want to publish your own book and do everything he did to do it, as he specifically touts some PODs and other resources. If technical books on book promotion overwhelm you, and you can see past the editing errors, this may be a decent book to read. After reading many books on book promotion, this book left me with marking one page as actual useful information for my own needs."
2,"Adequate, but not what I needed. My fault.","I got this book to update my old Maltin for my small reference library. Due to my own carelessness, I failed to consider that this volume does not include movies that are not on video, i.e., most TV productions and many older films. Another aggravation is the presentation of the indices of cast and director credits. While the number of individuals listed is impressive, their credits do not seem to be complete and worst of all, there are no dates. These lists should be chronological. The reviews are so-so.I'll keep this one in my library, but I guess I need to get another Matlin also."
1,Wasn't what I thought it was,"I thought I was ordering candied lemon peels that can be eaten on their own. These are horrible for that purpose. I just read another review that said you can bake it into things and put them in coffee. That sounds like a bad idea, but I could be wrong. FYI - it is sweetened with corn syrup. Shipping is expensive because they send it priority, which to me seems like a waste and you have to sign for your package. So, if you miss the mail man, you have to visit the post office."
2,Be better if they stayed on pitch,"I can't discard these songs completely, because they have such potential! Clever, fun lyrics, great beat, but BOY I wish this guy could hit his notes more often!I suppose this fellow requires the sort of ""pitch doesn't matter"" mindset that Grateful Dead listeners perfected years ago (or similar drugs). I'm just not that tolerant or substance affected."
3,The Evidence Speaks for Itself,"After reading this book, it was still clear to me that Darlie Routier is a murderer. This book did not disprove anything about the evidence found at the scene. Her story is not believable, I have boys of my own and I know that the story she told could not have happened the way she said it did. I think it's just so hard for most people, especially mothers to believe that a woman could kill her own children, that they refuse to believe it. So, there must be another explanation......but not so in this case. The right woman is in prison....may her children rest in peace."
3,Young Opera Fan,"Exactly what i was thinking. Sure these ladies are nice clear singers, but where was the Beverly Sills? Joan Sutherland? Birgit Nilsson? Being a HUGE admirer of the following I was rather shocked and disappointed to not see their arias on this c.d. Buy the c.d. knowing that it is incomplete yet still has some very nice singers-thus the 3 stars."
2,"Great for a month, then...","PROS:-Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch's wrist band held up well, unlike the Swiss Army watches I've had crack on me.CONS:-After only a month's use, the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp. It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch. It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside. From diving deeper than its 100M rating, you ask? No, from sweat and shower water. The digital display is now failing and I'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash. That's just unnaceptable, Nike."
2,Sort of complicated to use while running,"I like the watch and I use it on all my runs, but I never use all the features because the directions were so complicated that it's hard to remember what button should be pushed when running on top of the fact that the reset button is poorly places, so once you get everything going as you want you stand a good chance of erasing your progress. Perhaps, I don't really need this much watch, but it would be nice to easily use the features I've paid for. The watch itself however looks nice on and is comfortable."
5,My cat loves these and they make her fur look great!,"My cat is pretty picky about her treats. She loves these! And once she started eating them, her coat became so shiny and thick. I would recommend them."
4,"Almost, but not perfect","For those who have Clarion face plates, you know the plastic hard case can be a pain. That is why I wanted a slimmer, softer case. This case is excellent in what it is made for. Size, convienience, use. The only bad thing is that it's not more than a 1/8-1/4 inch thick...not much padding at all. It does have the air padding from being-oversized-to-fit-all in it that would protect it, but I don't want to test a 5 foot drop with it. So, almost perfect...and a lot better than a bulky hard case"
2,Head for a fallout shelter,"..and bring a few Tosh CDs with you, like ""Legalize It"", ""Equal Rights"" or ""Wanted Dread or Alive"". This album you can leave behind. Easily his worst album."
3,"Great price, could be bigger",The quality of the fabric is good. The price is good. But it really is a love seat throw and not a slip cover. It was not quite big enough to fully cover my love seat and I'll probably have to use buttons to keep it from slipping off when it is sat on.
2,Save your money,I bought this item in hopes of an easier/faster cleaning experience but it proved to be not the case. There is still plenty of grim between my chain links although the outer parts of my chain are quite clean. This chain cleaner cleans only slightly better than using a rag to grip your chain only because the brushes would occasionally scrub off some grime so I cannot recommend this to anyone who has to clean their chain regularly. Stick to quick daily rag wipes/lube or take the chain off and use a cheap stiff brush after some soaking in your cleaning solution.
5,Works Great,Very effective chain cleaner. Probably not as good as taking your chain off but it does a hell of a job while keeping your chain on the bike. The biggest problem I had was trying to balance my bike while I used the chain cleaner. If you have someone hold the bike you can clean your chain in a flash. A little messy but what do you expect. I've seen some people complain about it being easy to break but it seems pretty sturdy to me. All in all great product and great price.
3,Works for a bit...,"I was really impressed with this device the first couple of uses. Then I dropped it and part of it chipped. Then parts of it started to rust. Then some of the pins come out from the spinning brushes. So, overall it's great until you break it in."
2,buy cheaper at the store!,"what a rip-off. i bought the exact same item at my local japanese grocery store and it was only $4. i'm almost out and i wanted to see if i could buy them online, but every store is over-priced!youkan has always been a favorite snack for me, but paying double the price is definitely not worth it!"
2,"OK, but was hoping for something different","These are OK, but when you first put them on you can see them slightly, but as your skin warms them up that disappears. They do move all around so they have to be adjusted throughout the time they are worn. I'm looking for something that stays in place without adhesive."
4,Can you put the lid in the oven?,"I love my rival RED crockpot. However, I am not used to having three settings, so today when I came home and put supper in to cook, little did I know that I left it on WARM. So, supper wasn't ready. I decided to put it in the oven, but couldn't find my instruction book to see if I can put the lid in also. Does anyone know about this? I decided to be safe and not put the lid in, but rather cover it with foil until I find out for sure. It does throw me off with the different settings and also it does get hot on the outside, but I think my other one does too. I am glad I bought it!"
1,It sucks!,"This soundtrack is a waste of money. It's the same as Rocky and Rocky IV. If you do have Rocky IV don't get III. Rocky III has almost the same songs from I and IV. It's a waste of good money. Stick with I, II, IV..."
4,I can't believe how GREAT this blender is!,It's been 2 months now & we LOVE this blender. It is SOOOOOOO quiet. I love the ice crush feature. Blends our smoothies effortlessly on speed 1. ONLY complaint - a bit hard to pour from - could have a bigger spout. It is very easy to clean. I would buy it again!
2,"Quiet, but cheap","I spent a lot of money hoping this would not crap out like other blenders, and hoping it could make a dent margarita. It was quiet. That's the best thing I can say about it. The blades whirred around but did not chop evenly. Frozen drinks were unsuccessful. I could make a smoothie or purée soup. The bottom piece was difficult to figure out how it went on, and we almost broke it several times trying to figure it out. Finally, after 2 years of extremely light use (maybe I used it 10 times?) I went to make a smoothie and it did not stat. Piece of cr4p. Not like the old Krupa quality. Sigh."
2,Should've read the fine print; if there was any to read?,"I received the product, the Laserjet 6P cartridge, within a few days or ordering. And, yes, it was in an OEM package. However, it was out of date by more than a year. I did install it and it's working as advertised. But, I'd never again purchase printer consumables from this company. Just because of the out of date condition of the cartridge."
3,Very old stock,"The H-P LaserJet cartridge I received was about a decade old. It was ""new"" only in the sense that it had never been opened. (H-P changed the box to a newer style of graphics in 2002, so I know that the one I received was at least 9 years old.) When a consumable item is this far out of date, a reputable seller will disclose it in the product listing. This one didn't.That said, after printing a few dozen pages, the cartridge seems to work adequately."
5,satisfied,"I am pleased with how quickly the item was shipped and the quality was as expected, with the new toner cartridge solving the print problems I was having. I would use this supplier again and recommend them to others."
1,"Inflammatory, tabloidesque conjecture","Someone gave me this book, probably trying to present me with an ""other"" view to Hillary Clinton, and after having it on my shelf for months, I finally decided to give it a shot.I was not familiar with the author's other works, but as a serious student of political science, I am embarassed to think that someone thought this was an appropriate gift for me.Few actual facts are buried underneath heaps of unsubstantiated guesswork - the whole thing reads like a tabloid. I felt dirty having it in my house. I'm sorry this book got published, and that it inevitably fell into the hands of some that will continue to hate Hillary because they think this is the true her.This is the first book I actually preferred to throw away rather than take to a book trader. Please, spare yourself. If you want to read a book that dogs Hillary Clinton, pick one that does it in a educated, substantiated manner."
1,Very disappointing,"Given the author's accolades, I had hoped for something better. What a disappointment. This is no more than another politically timed hatchet job on a viable candidate. Sad to say, predictable, and very tiresome. I've already tossed it in the recycle bin; maybe something better can be done with the paper."
5,The Truth about Hillary,Truly a great book about the lies and evils that were commited by former President and Co-President (Hillary) Clinton. Every American should read this book. The message is very clear; Hillary does not represent the democrats or any other party or person then herself. She is only out for herself and damn anyone who gets in her way.
2,"Nice Fit, Poor Hardware","Cannot complain about the saddle itself. It fits nicely up against my M2 and holds shells well. I had zero problems with the install and it was a nice touch having the right allen wrench to install all the hardware (1 large bolt and 6 smaller ones). However, after no more than 100 rounds, the large bolt holding the saddle onto the gun was sheared off from recoil. I am a little disappointed that I now have to take a trip to the hardware store to fix something I feel should have held up a little longer.Would recommend this product, but don't be surprised if you actually use your gun and the hardware doesn't hold up."
5,The Experience of Buddhism,It is an excellent text which is required for a correspondence course I am taking on Buddhism which is taught by a fellow who has degrees from both Oxford and Harvard universities.
2,The cloth is too thin for a fleece!,"While I like the fact this is an all cotton fleece and its full-zip design, the cloth is too thin for a fleece."
1,Awful book,This book is 90% case studies and very old statistics and 10% basic theory.I've been working with online retail since 99 and I thought it would help me improve my business. But the book is terrible.At first I thought it was just introducing statistics and information from other companies. After 50 or 100 pages I found out that the entire book is loaded with insignificant information...
2,Too much emphasis on correction!,"I liked this book a lot at the start. As a breeder I love (and practice) all that they advise regarding raising a young litter. However, when they get into the actual puppy training they really turned me off with all of their talk about corrections. I think all owners should start with a much more positive approach to training, rather than jumping right in with corrections. It also gets a little long-winded at times."
2,Disappointed at use of outdated punishment-based methods.,"Twenty years ago when they wrote ""How To Be Your Dog's Best Friend,"" the Monks were cutting edge. Their philosophy of understanding and respecting their dogs was refreshing. However, they still advocated severe corrections such as scruff shakes, alpha rolls and hitting their dogs. Much progress has been made in dog training since then. There are now tens of thousands of ""positive reinforcement"" trainers who eschew physical punishment althogether, and positive methods have been proven highly effective for all types of dogs. It is disappoinitng at best to see the Monks clinging to their now antiquated methods in their newer puppy book. There is much good information in both of their books. It is a shame that the good information is tainted by their promotion of unnecessary and harsh punishments. I someday the Monks produce a book that embraces the new, scientific and positive principles of ""clicker training."""
2,There are better books out there,"This book was very positive and progressive when it was first published in the late 70s, but we have better books that don't include the old, outdated stuff. Job Michael Evans died too early, but he most likely would have continued to evolve as a dog trainer. Current trainers have gotten away from things like the ""alpha roll"" and other methods based on fear and force.I'd recommend ""Positive Puppy Training Works!"" by Joel Walton, or any of the puppy training books by Ian Dunbar or Gwen Bailey.I'm a professional dog trainer running a large training school located in a shelter. Correct puppy training and socialization keeps pets in their homes, and helps them become excellent companions."
5,The greatest book for raising a puppy,"I bought the first edition of this book some, maybe, 14-15 years ago and used it in raising puppies. I gave that one to someone and am getting a new puppy in September. The book is recommended by the breeder of German Shepherd Dogs, and we are revisiting the book. IT IS WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!! Don't raise a puppy without this book!"
1,Doesn't quite make it for me,"The Monks of New Skete were just about on the right track years ago, but their books rely on dominance theories (scruff shakes, and alpha rolls for example)rather than the reality and laws of applied animal behavior. For students of more modern and humane methods of training, I highly recommend Jean Donaldson's Culture Clash and Pam Reid's Excel-Erated Learning."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL DOG OWNERS!,"As a professional dog trainer I have to say the Monks are right on the mark! Their books are a must read for any and every dog owner. I read them when I first started out and learned more than I thought possible from a book. Read it, Learn it and most importantly Use It! An excellant companion for their other book and video!"
2,Does not deliver to sophisticated owners,"I have had dogs before, but since I was getting a Doberman I thought the monks might have an insight. I read the whole book and found no new info contained. If you have never had a dog before, then the info is very general and educational. The book's biggest issue is that it tells you about a subject, but does not tell you enough to act on it. Ex: they tell you a puppy has a fear period between 8-12 weeks old where you are not supposed to stress it out, but they don't tell you what things will stress a puppy out. You have to do a lot of guessing about what they really want you to do. They can get you to sit and stay, but they can't get you to understand what your dog is doing and why they are doing it.Here in Oregon, I had to go to a trainer to get anywhere because the training book was a waste of money."
3,Just what I was looking for.,"The book was just what I expected. However, I was hoping for a few surprises, some new insights. But it has been helpful."
4,Canine - Human Bond,"I had just purchased a new GSD puppy (who is of New Skete bloodlines) and thought this book would provide a solid foundation for understanding canines - something that is particularily needed with this breed. I found this book to provide just that as well as an excellent basis for understanding the canine-human bond which is necessary for successfully training any dog. What I found to be most helpful was the discussions on socialization and pack order (how we humans fit in.) While they do not completely follow the positive reinforcement method of training, they do provide a realistic balance between corrections and positive reinforcement, something easier for most dog owners yet humane to the pups. While they give some instructions on training - it is at a ""puppy"" level and provides only a foundation for adult work."
5,Wonderful book for all new puppy owners,Very practical and helpful information about puppies and how to raise them with love and obedience.
5,awesome,"Ahhh No Use For a name and Lagwagon. I love both of these bands. It's awesome to see that Joey and Tony hooked up and did acoustic versions of some of their best songs. It's quite an interesting change from fast paced punk rock to slowed down mellow versions of these songs. Good stuff, check it out."
5,This is the most interesting book I have ever read. Buy it.,"I am fifteen years old and have been reading this book constantly for at least three years. It is massively interesting. I have a copy of this book that was printed in 1981, before some of the facts were disproven. Isaac Asimov is one of the best writers of the twentieth century. I just wish he had lived to release volume two and on."
1,defective,I have been trying to get an RMA from the seller to return this item.They do not answer any messages.The item does not work at all. I would never recommend this seller to anyoneI doubt I will ever get my money back. What a RIPOFF!!!!!!It was purchased fromANTonline. Read their feedback first.
1,Disappointing toy,This toy is not appropriate for 5 year olds .It is very difficult with many pieces.My son was frustrated and disappointed.Pieces do not snap together and fall apart.
2,Not for beginners!,I've been doing yoga for a few months now and have really enjoyed it. This series did not seem like it was for beginners at all. It moved way too fast for me and did not give me enough time to fully stretch into the parts I needed work on the most! The abs section is ok (you feel the burn) but not long enough.. I say rent it from Blockbuster 1st and see if you like it! I've really enjoyed Crunch's yoga video and Kathy Smith too.. they're easy to follow and a great workout!
2,Yoga for beginners?,"It may seem to some that I have rated this a little low; however, it is due to the fact that the dvd is presented as one for beginners. I am sure that these routines are a cakewalk for the more seasoned veteran, but they are certainly not for true beginners. I am a fairly flexible person, and I could not even get into a proper downward facing dog, much less the rest of the postures the lower body instructor zoomed through. I will stick with my beginner pilates routine for now and perhaps revisit this dvd in the future when I have gained more muscle tone and flexibility (I hope). Otherwise, I suggest it be retitled."
5,Batman: the greatest Superhero of all time...,"Here we have Batman in his brand new human life Adventures. We see him grow with his ""issues"" as an orphan and try to find love in many different places but as always his double personality gets in the way. We'll see Bruce Wayne/Batman defeat all his archi-enemies: The Joker, The Penguin, Catwoman, Two Face, The Riddler, Mr. Freeze & Poison Ivy. And here it tells how he meets his longtime partner and... ""lover"" for some people... Robin. But anyways I highly recommend this DVD Pack for every Batman Fan, Buy it & stay tunned for Batman begins, the new movie."
3,"Gets you all four movies, that's all","I got this at a bargain bin price of $10 (not on Amazon) and it shows. The transfers are weak and there is little in the way of special features. Still, a cheap way to own all four of the original Batman movies, though only the first two (and possibly, possibly, the third) are worth watching.Darkhorse86"
1,horrible,this is a horrible COPY of the movie and there are not 4 movies just two this was a horrible buy
3,Not the Real Deal,"I had seen 'Batman' awhile back. I then purchased and watched 'Batman Begins'. So much for what came before. I will now give the 'Anthology' to whomever wants it. Batman Begins is true to the DC comics and, what I would decribe as, more serious. It is in a way and epic story. Since this is a review of the 'Anthology', it's OK for what it is. But what it's not is 'the real deal'."
1,"Poor Quality, plan to return to Amazon.","We ordered 3 of the 4-Film Warner Bros DVDs. Batman Collection, Lethal Weapon Collection and Superman Collection. We opened Lethal Weapon Collection and the 1st movie appeared to be of fair quality and then turned it over to play the 2nd movie and it would just start and stop. We did not even unwrap the other 2 and plan to return them all. I guess it shows once again that you ""get what you pay for"".DO NOT Recommend to anyone. Better to buy the movies as singles."
5,Bang The Drum Slowly,"This sad, moving film showcases emerging brilliance of young DeNiro, with the underrated Moriarty also turning in a superb performance. Both baseball fans and devotees of great film alike should readily agree on this title."
2,Wouldn't waste my money.,I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book. Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal. If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters. My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret. Your husband will get a lot more out of it!!!
4,Well worth it,"This video does a good job of breaking the swing down into small managable pieces. My swing improved greatly, I was able to find more power and improved my contact. I have been playing about 13 years and shoot around 95. I know that will improve after watching this and making the needed changes. I have been out and practiced the changes and can already see an improved ball flight and consistancy. If you need a brush up or reminder just watch it again. If you would rather spend the $75+- on a lesson or two then go for it. I would rather have a lesson at my finger tips from one of the best for the same price. Good luck and enjoy, worth the price and effort."
4,Set Up for tension,With this book Claire McNab returns to the excellent form of her earlier Carol Ashton mysteries. A highly enjoyable well written book which gives the flavour of Australia without dropping into cliches. Both the main plot and the usual romantic sub plot are excellent. The book is full of suspense and the intrigue is maintained until the very end. Highly recommend this book for all who enjoy detective mysteries.
1,Lost the plot,Claire McNab has lost the plot - the series started well but the story lines now seem to take second place to the inspector's private life. Carol Ashton while proclaiming a wish to stay with Sybil can't seem to pass up an oportunity to sleep with any woman that comes along. The sex scenes have become functional & unappealing. A shame.
2,Why Do I Keep Reading These?,"This Detective Inspector Ashton's 11th outing. It could be interchanged with several of the previous outings. Someone is murdered, Ashton catches the case, she solves case, her personal life remains static. I keep hoping that Ashton will grow as a person, but she remains the same book after book. After finishing this one, I promised myself to read number 12 and if it wasn't an improvement, I will stop reading the series and move on - much as I wish Carol Ashton would."
1,This is an edited version,This movie is not the original. It's cut to pieces. Very disappointing. I would have never bought this film if I had known it was as cut up has it was. Do not buy.
2,This movie really hurts.,It is long cliched and goes on and on. I remember a much better and different movie. Funny how the mind plays tricks on you.
4,Character Development,"REASONS TO BUY:Unlike the first part, Bronson has a strong unyielding character. He's not the least bit afraid to get the job done this time and doesn't stop untill he gets every single on of those creeps that killed his daughter. It really gives you a sense of staisfaction even if it's just a movie.REASONS NOT TO BUY:This is the cut version. Evidently, some people believe that we are not intelligent enough to view certain scenes. I think it's worth the time to search the internet for the full uncut version."
5,Buy It Just For The Bonus Disk,"I owned a couple of Super Furry albums before but I didn't pickup their Welsh-language album. So when ""Rings Around The World"" came out I took a chance. It was worth every penney.The Bonus CD alone is worth the price. They put the most melodic SFA songs I have heard on it with ""Happiness Is A Warm Pun"" and ""Edam Anchorman"" as two standouts. ""Happiness..."" is also your chance to hear the Furries do blues!!!Great all around."
2,Not very pleased with this item,"I am not very pleased with this item. It works fine, but when I received it, it looked like it was a used whistle, the chrome paint was peeling off and did not have the appearance of tha new whistle. Sorry, just not pleased with it."
4,The best on the Market,"These DVD pages are the best I have seen. The great thing about them is that the cover of the DVD will fit in the display pocket by simply folding it in half (I speak of conventional covers used on the plastic dvd cases.) Other brands I have tried are a little too small and require cutting to size. These pages also hold 4 DVDs and some other brands only hold 2. This product is superior to all on the market that I have seen. I want to give it 5 stars, however, I find the price to be a little high. You pay almost as much for a new case with pages in it as you do for the refill pages. I wasn't happy with that."
1,Why...,"Why can't both sides be the same? Why did they need to change the leaves? Why can't I fit 8 DVDs rather than 4 DVDs and two DVPs...isn't it all about the discs, saving shelf space, etc. Case Logic should make the replacement leaves the old and new way for the customers who, like me, want to make the most of my case rather than wasting $ and space."
1,"Carry the case, DVD's SLIDE OUT into the case!","This is the only available refill for my 320 disc case. The funny thing is, if you go carrying it around by the handle, the openings are pointed DOWNwards. It is aggravating at the least when the case is zippered closed and you open it to find all your discs have slid down to the edge and you have to put them all back in the slot, and hazardous to your discs at the worst. You could open your case and have discs fall all over the place. I once lifted the unzipped case to hand to a friend to pick out a movie after just getting the refills, and it started raining discs across the floor.DO NOT BUY if you are a videophile or a musicophile."
5,Highly Recommended!,"I am shocked to see such lousy responses to this book. I have been using this book for two semesters in college and have had nothing but success with it. I have over 15 physics books and the most thorough and complete one is the Ohanian one. The strategy of this book is to teach physics with a calculus approach instead of a simplified version for the weak. Classical physics was developed by Newton, and he developed it using calculus, so this is the way to go if the serious student wants to learn and really understand classical physics. Also, I have encountered very few errors in this book, so if your solution doesn't agree with Ohanian's, it may be due to a mistake on your part."
1,"Outdated, inaccurate, and confusing","This is the last physics book I would recommend you buy. I am forced to use it for class, but I would never choose to use it. It doesn't explain concepts well, and the few examples do not help. Also the answers in the back are often incorrect."
2,"Aaaagh, the eyes! The HIDEOUS eyes!","When I saw this in the shop on the Bratz aisle I just thought, ""Wow! Cool PJs, cute pet, cute accessories, cute hair, EWWWWW WHAT'S UP WITH HER EYES????!!!!!!""Yes people, the eyes are truly hideous. She has the usual green eyes, but this was a murky green. And it's not the colour of the eyes that disgusted me; it was the shape. The eyes didn't match, they weren't symmetrical. She had no eyeshadow and very little eyelashes. And the eyes are a pretty main feature of a doll, so I passed this one up and got Yasmin instead.Before I completely put down this doll, I've gotta say that her hair is black and long, glossy and shiny, basically gorgeous!!!!Also, her flocked goggle-eyed cat is sooo cute and I know it would be great fun, and the colours on her cute and cosy looking PJs are amazing and look Chinese, which is great!If the eyes were better, this would be the perfect Jade! But for now, I'm still waiting..."
2,Not entirely pleased,The colors of this bag are not the same in real life as it is in the photo - the colors are more dull. But the rest of the bag is ok.
3,Useful but outdated,"I found many useful items and information in this book but it is in need of an update. There are many helpful hints for how to select and deal with recruiters. The tone and theme of this book is slanted to the retained search recruiter (as the author is one). I also believe that the emphasis on ""mass mailing"" techniques is overstated and that more material needs to be developed for today's internet (no reference to ""LinkedIn"" networking or ""The Ladders""). Overall I think this book is useful from a strategic/background perspective but not as much so tactically."
1,the endless swampy bog,what an endless swampy bog about the insider nauseating inside workings of the recruitment business. Get and editor. Boil it down to something readable and relevant.
1,The Brothers Gruesome,"As a teacher, I found this book inapproprite for young children. The pictures in the book were grotesque and violent. Some of the wording was rather questionable as well. I found the content appropriate for much older children, perhaps with a black streak of humor."
2,Needs to be redesigned to save cover art,"Each page fits two DVD's: a pair of booklets/liner notes in plastic sleeves in front of the page, and the corresponding DVD's in protective pockets in the rear.But there is no place provided to store the DVD's cover art! The pocket for ""liner notes"" only fits the small insert that some (but by no means all) DVDs sometimes come with. If they had made the ""liner note"" pocket just a little larger, one could save the cover art.Until these sleeves are designed to save all the materials, they are just causing another storage problem. My advice? Wait for a redesign."
5,This is a really remarkable book.,"""100 Days..."" provides a rare combination of unique practice; any more or less advanced student may find helpful tips, easy to learn but hard to discover; and - maybe the most important one - the books teaches us to be happy by our being with the Way since happiness is the natural state of human mind. I think that ""100 Days..."" is a must for all Qigong enthusiasts around the world, regardless of the style or background"
2,Disappointing,"The title and the artwork suckered me in. I'm always on the lookout for a new series with female leads in amateur roles. But this book was a bitter disappointment and I continued reading only it in hopes it would improve. It didn't. The mystery is badly constructed with the guilty party almost standing up and self-identifying in the earliest chapters. The characters all sound alike with awkwardly constructed and generally inane dialogue. The lead character has few redeeming features. I don't expect flawless people, but the lead isn't even likeable which is pretty much a necessity in cozies. If you're looking for a well-written beauty-parlour based mystery wait until mid March when ""Bubbles Unbound"" by Sarah Strohmeyer is released. I read the ARC and it's hysterical in a Janet Evanovich sort of way with full-bodied characters and a solid mystery. It's what PERMED TO DEATH ought to have been..."
5,Fun from beginning to end!,"Settle down with this book, an ice tea, and your feet up. You're in for a relaxing and enjoyable read. Marla Shore is so much fun! She keeps you guessing and wanting more adventures to come! It's a great way to spend an afternoon."
2,No love for this glove,"My almost five year wanted to be a Power Ranger for Halloween and I thought these gloves would be a nice accessory that would also be a toy after Trick or Treat.The promised sound effects are muffled and can only be heard when the gloves are positioned just right. It's too complicated for my son to make it work regularly and he gets frustrated.He ended up not wearing them for Halloween and now they are sitting, pristine, on top of his dresser.In closing, the Thunder Blast Gloves are not a lot of play value for my little Power Ranger Wannabe."
3,Disappointing,"My wife and I are huge Torvill & Dean fans. The film quality is not great, there is way to much talking, and worst of all, they left out some of the all time great performances - including the 1984 Olympics!"
2,Skeetervac. SV27,"My Skeetervac SV-27 worked well for the first year. Kept the bugs away so we could be outside at night. Killed tons of Mosquitos, And May Flies. But only 1 year later and the skeetervac is lacking in good service. Only 2 of the 5 LED lights are working, And the Skeeter vac will not stay running. It's a 250.00$ paper weight right now. I will be contacting BlueRhino soon to try to replace this for free"
1,Seriously shut down my XP Pro Computer,"First CD that seriously shut down my computer. I had to turn off the power strip, to have computer shut down, wouldn't shut down the regular way. I sent the CD for a refund or credit. I have bought many CD's from Amazon and other places and have never had any shut down my computer, and in this case a serious shut down as I put the CD in my computer to play. I tried the CD in a Boom Box, and it played. So it must have some significant copy guard right at the beginning."
2,An epic journey that is way too epic.,"Books this long need to be way more interesting or it turns into a slog, I don't care how fast you read. This one really bogged me down. I am not saying it was not a good story, it just needed to be way shorter and keep moving a lot faster."
4,"Good timing, but not perfect conditiom","The shipping wasmreally quick, but the paper cover of the book has a tiny wrinkle on the side. Probably it was there before they shipped the book, but anyways, 4 stars."
3,Disappointed,"Own several shaping products. Love Bali brand items, very disappointed with this product's support. Comfortable and pretty though. I don't have much bulge to conceal and it did an ok job of ""flattening"" those areas, however, I am a 38-40 D/DD and this provided ""shelf only"" support. Not good enough obviously.I really liked how far over the straps are on the cups as far as looks. Not sure how one would remove the straps for this item because it does not have AnYthinG to keep it up...perhaps a tight fitting dress? However, the cups are heavily padded and I tried this on under several items and it was visible under different material thickness and type also. Though I had it on only 15 minutes, the lace was uncomfortable in the crotch.Depending on you preference and reason for buying, this may be a total waste of money."
5,"East to read, easy to learn","The authors presentation style not only makes learning easy but also enjoyable. I do not recall any technical manual that advises the reader to 'Take a break' which helps to avoid overload. Unfortunately, the book is somewhat dated, which I knew when I purchased it, but the website referenced in the book, containing sample scripts, is no longer available. Even at that, the book is easy to read and understand."
5,Excellent Toy,"this toy is great! it can communicate for 200 ft. and even through walls! this isn't recomended for big kids because it may cause your head to hurt when you put it on. the set comes with a mini keyboard you can tie on your wrist. the bad thing is that sometimes when you press one of the buttons (like the letter D for example) it doesn't appear when you send it to your friend. if you are a little distracted by something, you can tell when your friend sent it by seeing a continueous flash. make sure you put it on from the right side because if you put it on the left side then the words will appear upsidedown. the set comes with 2 communicators."
4,Ink paper,Bought the Sony SVM ink and paper pack (75) and very happy with it. It's hard to find them in stores now. The price was very reasonable.
1,Upset Sony Customer,I can't believe Sony no longer makes the paper and print cartridge and I for one will not pay $199.00 for one value pack when I use to pay $101.00 for 3 value boxes.
5,Exactly As Described,"This is exactly what I was looking for to print more pictures with my Sony EX550. A bit disappointed that any other paper gives an error message saying ""wrong paper"" but since this comes with 3 packs and ribbons it should hold me over for a while.Everything was as described, thank you."
5,Sony photo paper purchase,My daughter made the first purchase of this item for my Sony photo printer as we were not able to purchase photo paper in any store locally. She passed on the info to me and I have since ordered myself. The pricing is good and your service and delivery has been excellent. The item # is SVM-75LS.
3,small,i got this chair to go with a child's desk. it came up listed along side the desk as if they went together but actually the chair was way to small for the desk. it is very sturdy and not bad at all as a chair for a 3 year old but just didn't fit for what i bought it for
5,"Wonderful, sturdy chair","This is my third kidkraft chair for my kids play table. The chairs are so sturdy. I often sit in them when I am helping my children, and they can totally bear adult weight. They are a breeze to clean and are very smart looking. I've had two of these chairs for years and just added the third chair for the girls' friends. My kids are now 5 and 8 ad still use them daily. Highly recommend."
4,Good chair for the little one.,These chairs are very nicely built. They are solid and have withstood months of a 2 year old tossing and jumping on them. They seem to be made of great hardwoods and the paint stands up well. They were very easy to put together are sturdy.
2,Smells bad,Haven't noticed it being better or worse than other lotions but it stinks. Don't like using it because of the smell
2,Don't spend $55!,This little booklet is sold at the free 3-day Millionaire Mind Intensive seminars for about $12 (depending on how many you buy). It's definitely not worth more than that.
3,Cat's won't touch,Neither of my two rescued cats will touch these flakes. They love other treats(especially Wellness treats) but not these onesEdit: Gave the pack to my sister and her cat went insane for them
4,good read,While very educational it is written in a fun and entertaining way.Brings the theologies of the past and their influence on modern thought.
3,Useful but hard to get,"These pages fit into my DVD Albums just great, but it was really a drag that the manufaturer would not ship to a military APO address. This meant I paid postage twice: Once to family in Tennessee then again to get them to me here on a US military base overseas. APO postage is exactly the same as mailing stateside, but still many businesses will not do it. Hard to understand."
1,very poor,again as in all air hog products this simply cannot be played with as described. This toy would be great if you simply purchase it to have your child look at it but to not play with it. I had purchased this toy and with in five minutes of my son playing with it it broke. I took it back and got a new one thinking the first one was defective but to simply find out again that it broke with in 5 minutes. If you purchase this you will simply be throwing your money away.
2,"Just so, so!!","Was a little disappointed in the book. Not that much help for a home goat owner.Too much money for what it gives. If you want more home help instead of vet info, then don't buy this one."
4,chevere,quick dlvry no damages cd was very good worth it all songs were smooth and easy on the mind and of good quality
5,Comfort/ Hope for Women Living Through Breast Cancer,"If you have just found out you have an abnormal mamogram or have just had a breast biopsy that is positive for breast cancer, this is an excellent book for you to read as a baseline story of the life experience of a woman who tells you what to expect and how she coped with her own diagnosis and treatment. There are other books with lots of details and information on therapy for breast cancer. There are other books about coping with this disease from either religious or philosophical perspectives, but this book is very personal. It will help focus your energy on surving, not in a tear-jerky way, but in a light, positive way."
5,Great case,This is an excellent minidisc holder for the price... If you're looking for a strong durable minidisc organizer this is what you need!
3,Pretty good,"It was good, although the ending seemed a little... sudden and the beginning was a bit unclear. But it did have several humorous aspects."
4,Annie's Baby,The book Annie's Baby is by an anoymous teenager who becomes pregnant by and older guy. And then as most guys do when she is finally able to tell him he leaves her. It would be a really good book for someone who is pregnant and who is a teenager because it shows you how a real life teen survives what's happening in her life and how things do get better and that it's not the end of the world. It would also be a good book for any teenage girl because it warns you and shows you what the consequences that you could have by having sex at a young age and showing you the responsibility of having a baby and what you'd have to go through while being pregnant.
3,A nice FICTIONAL book,Annie's Baby is an overall good read(thus the three stars). But 'Annie's' writing is odd. Like 'Alice' and 'Kim' she repeats things 3 times. But the one thing I LOVE about this book is when 'Annie' finds out she's related to 'Dr. B' and automatically knows who she is. I also enjoyed the tape transcription things where her and Sparks talk. You can tell Sparks tries to portray herself as a do-good pyscholgist who would never try to scare kids out of doing things. Despite the unrealistic factor it's an o.k book.
4,For reluctant teen girl readers,"As an adult, I found the book to be extrememly predictable, but teen girls, ages 13 to 16, love the book and become hooked on it as soon as they read the back cover. I frequently have to replace the copies that I keep in my classroom for SSR time. I always say that I am not going to loan them out, but then when a girl that HATES to read begs me to loan her the book because she's hooked on it....well, I give in every time. For so many of my female students, it has been the book that started them on the road to reading for pleasure. For that reason alone, I love this book and give it 5 stars! (OK, I accidentally clicked on 4 stars, and now it won't let me change to 5 stars!)"
5,janesha,I think that annie is going to be a good mom I hope she take care of her baby. And always love her mother because she was their the whole way. And dont think about danny cause all he wanted from you was sex.
5,A wonderfully informative book!,"I learned a lot from this book, more than maybe I wanted to know. Before this, I believe i kind of shielded myself from all of that kind of stuff, but now, I know that I have to learn. I beleive that by reading this book, I will become a safer teenager."
1,Beatrice Sparks spins web of fiction,"She was the editor of Go Ask Alice and that was proven to be fiction as were several other of her 'diary' books. But they continue to publish this woman's works of fiction as non-fiction. Do the research, find the truth."
2,Not a must read there are better books out there!,"This book, was ok, It took a long time though to find out that she was prego, and the fact when she is prego she talks about it a little bit here and there but the book focuses on other points. Not only that it paints a really bad picture of teen moms, and it teen moms like "" Annie,"" that make all teen moms look bad. Teen parents are great parents and they do just a good of a job as a 35 yr old parent. But the book focuesed on the point that all teen parents are bad which I know isn't true because many of them love there children and finish school and so on. The ending was terrible! I didn't like it at all, so basically the whole book just bashed teen moms and dads. So our society will never learn that until we help teen paretns become succesful the cycle will never stop, and our society will be just as bitter. Teen parents can do it! I think that they are wonderful parents who love their kids, unlike this book!"
1,Pregnant Anne,"The book should be called ""Pregnant Anne"" not ""Anne's Baby""Base on those review I read, the books rarely talk about annie's baby. It talked about her and her boyfriend, and her being pregnant.I disagree with the poor title of the book. I thought it was going to be especially about a baby not Anne...like the baby getting sick or something."
5,Excellent book for young girls,I saw this book when I was younger but didn't get around to reading it until I turned 18. It was a good book for a young girls and lets them in on a little bit of reality. Of course I wouldn't think every girl would be so naive as Annie was but I guess there are girls out there like her. I think it's perfect for girls to realize that some things just aren't worth it.
5,Good book for teenager girls,"I would recommend this book for all teenage girl. It is about a young teenage girl getting pregnant at the age of 14. It's really sad how her boyfreind treated her and abused her. He would always call her bad names. When she told him that she was pregnant he just left her and told her that he didn't care and that it wasn't his baby. But Annie's mom was very supportive of her. Annie's mom worked two jobs just to pay all the bills and she didn't even yell at Annie when she told her that she was pregnant. I think that this book would be a good reason why girls should wait to do it. And the saying ""everyone's doing it"" isn't true because everyone isn't."
4,good structered overview of Mantak Chia's teaching,"I began with Tao Yoga reading Mantak Chia's books - they're great ! This one presents essentially the same knowledge, with some minor add ons (and leave outs). What I liked about it is the well structered approach (something I missed with Chia) and the excellent illustrations. I recommend it as an introduction to Tao Yoga. If you can afford it get the Chia books as well. And YES, my sex life got a hell lot more exciting!"
3,Warning! No page numbers for Kindle version,"If you are using this book for class and need to only read specific assigned pages, then don't get the Kindle version! There are no page numbers, and now I don't know what to read for my class.Edit: Now I see that if it says [Print Replica] then it will have page numbers. Look at the sample first in order to know if there are page numbers. I'm finding a work around by just going through the chapters and finding the topics I need, but it's still very strange and annoying to not have page numbers."
3,Dry but thorough documentary series,"This is a good ten part documentary series about world war I. However, it is not very fancy. There are some few black and white interviews with veterans and a couple of ""quotes"" of historical characters given by voice actors. However, most of the narration is a monotone narration given from script without even a presenter or talking head. There are few frills and no fancy maps, 3d CGI, actor battle recreations or anything like that.PRO: Very thorough ten part series, very competent and accurate from everything I saw (judging by my limited amateur historian knowledge of World War 1CON: If you need eye candy, engaging storytelling, or like reenactment or computer graphics, there are none. Because of this, the presentation is very dry and almost like a classroom experience.I bought my copy for $5 at a local store called Bi-Mart. At that price, this is worth it for the completest or serious student interested in the War to End All Wars."
5,BEST DOCUMENTARY EVER,To the history lover this documentary was fascinating filling in details previously unknown and excellent footage to support the facts. Beautifully researched and well presented.
2,Poorly Done,"This appears to be a thrown together job. Lots of stock footage that repeats, repeats and repeats. Barely got through the first disc. Narration was good and did cover main points. Want to see how the US involvement is handled but so far not imnpressed."
2,Not much effect on heel pain,"These heel pads did not make much, if any, difference in my heel pain. Thankfully they didn't cost a fortune."
5,wonderful,Heard Carol of the bells on the internet and just fell in love with it. Had to buy the album. The rest is just as beautiful.
4,great album,"how could it not be? Willie Nelson has made so much great music. I really like this album, but I wish it had included a couple other songs, especially whiskey river and the city of new orleans.However, nothing's perfect (why I rated it 8), but this is pretty good stuff!"
1,Disappointing sums it up,"Well, I was looking forward to this game for months. I was hoping it would replace CoD4 with the added element of vehicles. Unfortunately, it falls way short. I felt the game's graphics were dark and the sound was pitiful. The vehicles were less then impressive, and you can't change views which is disappointing. I disliked the game play so much I went back to the store and requested a refund two days later. Fortunately, I'm a regular there and they gave me ful store credit."
3,Too much detail,I like 1st person shooter games without too much set up time. There are too many choices to make nefore you can kill anything here.
2,Pot Noodle Bushido,"This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword."
4,Twisty and Satisfying!,"A highly satisfying thriller. Having once met the author, I'd say the hero is well modeled after him.This was a very fun read. Recommended."
3,Unfortunate,"This book was a definite departure from the wonderful writing of MacLachlan. Don't get me wrong; this book is filled with wonderful flowing language. It's true literature amung the twaddle that fills most bookshelves. It definitely isn't dumbed down, and it's engaging and witty.Unfortunately, it's also full of a worldview I hadn't noticed in her other books. Reincarnation (""if you died, what would you want to come back as?""), lack of absolute truth (fiction is a different kind of truth), and other ideas I'd rather not expose such young children to abound in this book. It also has an eleven year old child deciding that she's ""in love,"" without any direction given by her parents.This is good book to read with your child, so you can discuss the ideas within and allow the child to decide what to believe.I gave it three stars because of the exceptional writing, but I can't bring myself to give all five because of the strong humanistic worldview."
2,wood chips off,Not good. After about a month of use the wood started chipping off around the top. I therefore recommend another brush.
1,Bamboozled,"The picture of the exhaust system misrepresents the system you will receive if you order this part. I was on the hunt for a dual exhaust system for a 1988 Mitsubishi Starion. After entering make and model I was match up with part number LET-M01. I ordered the part and much to my dismay and great disappointment was that the LET-M01 is a single exhaust system much like what I already have installed. When I called to ask WTF? And about the picture, I was told the picture only serves as a reference. Look at the back of that GTO, I see dual exhaust. This is not what you get. Now I have to spend time and effort to go through the hassle of sending it back."
2,Barry Farm candied lemon peel,It really did not have the taste of lemons. I was very disappointed. It could almost have been anything if were not lemon colored
3,Ummm.....,"Generally if it's by Take That I love it, but this one's a bit slow and whiney. Would not have been my choice for a single."
3,"Super maps, but....",Definitely not enough coverage of the Caribbean and Atlantic sites. This book should be named the Pacific and Indian Ocean Dive Atlas. It is a quality written book however that covers the included sites thoroughly. Would recommend it but not for Caribbean reference!
2,Flawed,"This book has some valuable information, but as others have suggested it does indulge in a bit of historical revisionism:Sam Langford did indeed carry Stanley Ketchel. Amongst many writers of the day it was agreed that Langford seemed to be ""holding back"".Harry Greb lost 4 of the first 5 rounds vs. Kid Norfolk. The next 5 rounds were all Greb as he gave Norfolk a sound beating. In their famous disqualification bout it was Norfolk who was ahead when the bout was halted.It wasn't until Greb was battle-worn(he'd had close to 300 bouts)and in decline that Tiger Flowers was able to beat him, both title bouts being close (some say controversial) split-decisions.The author really needed to do his homework on the no-decision bouts."
2,Where is the low G?,"Whomever designed this set wasn't a musician. I don't have this, and I probably won't buy it for my music classes, because it doesn't have the low G. The ""main"" handbells set has the diatonic C scale. The most useful note to add to the collection would be the ""SOL,"" or dominant, below the ""DO,"" or tonic, so we could harmonize using I and V, which is a chord progression 99.99% of songs use. Even if we only used these bells melodically, how many melodies go down to SOL below DO? Let's see, Frere Jacques, Yankee Doodle, Eensy Weensy Spider, If You're Happy and You Know It........ Give me the G and I'll buy it. A, A#, and B are gravy."
3,Doesn't receive atomic clock in Phoenix.,"Doesn't receive WWV time signal for days at a time even though Phoenix is only 700 miles away from Collins, CO. Heavy & bukly. Display is very easy to read with lots of contrast. Would be perfect if it received atomic clock every day."
1,No Order of Battle information of use,The author's volume on the Bulge and certain reviews raised my hopes. This work is not for those seeking order of battle information such as Corps level assets or TD brigades attached to divisions. It does not present a single Order of Battle of any sort.
3,Really Just an OK Ring,"This ring, I am sorry to say, Looks very inexpensive in reality. The diamonds look fake and strange, and I am really not at all impressed with it, My husband likes it, and I guess for the price I paid, I didn't get a bad deal, I was just not happy with the overall look of it, once it arrived, like I stated, it looks cheap. Maybe I should have known that the item name, being ""Good Looking men's Diamond Wedding Ring"", should have told me it was just a Good ring, nothing more.S"
5,Most bands would give their left arm for an album as good as this,"This 4th Band album has gotten a bad rap over the years. Only because the first 3 were so legendary. I tell you what, do yourself a favor and listen to this album again, I was amazed how good it really is. With songs like The River Hymm, Life Is A Carnival, Moon Struck One, Shoot Out in Chinatown an dthe underrated Volcano, it's an album most bands would die for to make."
4,Stumbled?!? In yer dreams!,"Maybe it didn't sell as well as earlier albums, and maybe some critics didn't like it, but as a musician I'm here to tell you it's terrific. I'd give it 5*s but that has to be reserved for the truly great Rock of Ages set. Face it, The Band never appealed to the masses -- they just went over the average person's head, I think. This disc has some truly remarkable performances, and belongs in every Band fan's collection, as does the entire reissue series. All are uniformly well produced -- the clarity is amazing -- and taken all together, the liner notes form a detailed and well written history of the group's output. Shoot Out in Chinatown, Volcano, and Thinkin' Out Loud are standout songs, and Life is a Carnival is still a masterpiece.Stumbled? No, they just veered off in a direction no one predicted, when the critics wanted another ""brown album."""
4,Youth and simplicity,"If you like Juan Gabriel's youthful voice and the simple backup of a small mariachi group, you'll like this album. There's not much variety in this early `70s CD, however. It was a time when Juan Gabriel was a better songwriter than singer and his arrangers weren't doing him any favors. One song seems to run into the next without a significant change in rendition or style. The CD is a good example of Gabriel's start, and the sounds are happy ones. However, if your taste runs more toward the professionalism of his 1990s work in El Palacio de Bellas Artes, you'll probably find that this one comes up a little short."
3,Not what I thought,"The first disappointment was it is written in French, which I don't read and many of the pictures are of dark rooms and decorating. I guess I expected French interior decor with yellows, reds, greens and blues. It has some nice rooms, but many are too different. It isn't for anyone looking for French decorating pictures and ideas."
2,Very blah,"I'm not sure what convinced other people to give this product such high ratings. Maybe other gluten-free mixes are worse? But after trying this cake, I have come to the conclusion that garbanzo bean flour has NO place in cake mix. Falafel mix, yes. Cake mix, never again. I am going to make my own gluten-free cake with rice flour and whatever else I can find. This is okay if you plan to slather it with sweet toppings, like a big scoop of ice cream per slice, but as a plain piece of cake, not so good."
4,good product,"this is an perfect product for people who want there mp3 to be safe and those who travel alot. I have the adiovox1000 and after purchasing it, I took a trip and felt i needed something to keep my batteries, earphones,memory card, and mp3 player in the same place, well this does it.Its a good item plus a very cheap price!"
1,waste of time and money,"The music on this CD is for a select group of listeners, which I am not one of. Several of the songs were instrumentals that I almost never hear anywhere, and all the songs were not in a 'top 500' hit list IMO. A total waste of money IMO."
3,The movie is better...,"I'm not all that impressed on the soundtrack from this hit film. Maybe it's because I'm a child of the 70's and 80's, and can't appreciate it? That being said, the first track ""Everybody's Talkin'"" probably is the most popular song, and the only song that comes to mind when thinking about ""Midnight Cowboy."" But, I have to admit that I was very impressed with the ""Midnight Cowboy"" track itself. The lonely, errie harmonica brings you to a different place with its power and strikingly different sound. ""Fun City"", ""Old Man Willow"", and ""Science Fiction"" are all different, and worth a listen. The other songs didn't do me either way. Worth a shot for more reasons than Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talkin'""."
3,The subtle humor may be lost on younger children,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the characters are funny and engaging. The illustrations are gorgeous and contribute much to the telling of the story. Infact, they are essential to the story as it should be in a good picture book. My only complaint is that it is aimed at a little older audience than I first thought. My 4 year old struggled with it, although we have a garden and she was comfortable with the plants being grown.That being said, the book was a excellent way to open a discussion on the plants illustrated in the story and why the hare was so clever to grow them. There was a good object lesson with the lazy bear and the hare who wanted to make his family's life better. I like the fact the whole family participated in the planting, caring for, and harvesting the crops and that the bear learned a valuable lesson in the end."
5,It's a done deal Bear!,"This is my favorite children's book. The artwork is beautiful, hence the Caldecott Award.The story is about poor Rabbit who is struggling to care for his family while his lazy neighbor Bear is sitting on an empty plot of farm land. Rabbit makes a deal with Bear that if Bear let's him plant on the farm he will split all the crops in half and Bear wouldn't have to do any of the work. Three times they make this deal and each time Rabbit takes the good half of the crop leaving the inedible parts to Bear. This book is a lesson that teaches you need to work for what you want and cleverness and hard work pays off."
5,This is one of the best illustrated and written books!!!!!!!,The illustrations are so cute and are very eye appealing to small childrens. The subject of the books is very good also. A must for everychild young and old. I was really impressedwith this book.
5,Very Clever AND educational,"My granddaughter and I really enjoyed the book. At 5, it was an excellent teaching regarding how different vegetables grow AND it also showed that hard work pays off for the rabbit."
5,Read it,"I think this should be required reading for anyone raising a teenager. If my brother-in-law had read this, perhaps his daughter would not be living with me instead of him right now.Believe it or not, sex is a healthy part of relationships. Will I let my daughter have her boyfriend over for the night when she is 16? Absolutely, as long as they have shown they are going about the relationship in a mature manner. Would I rather her get caught having sex in the back of a car in a parking lot? Would I rather her tearfully tell me she is pregnant because she was too scared to ask about birth control?Read it and think. Of course not everyone will agree, but it will give you a different perspective."
5,O MY GOSH!!!!,"This Game Is The Best Paintball Game Ever!!!! Really if your into paintball check it out its so realistic. Its sort of Tactical you can order your team into formations. Switch hands, wipe paint with the cool cheat meter! seurosly if u like Paintball Get this game it RULES!!!!"
5,Great book for opening up discussion with your pre-teen,"My almost 10 year old daughter loves this book. She felt so empowered with information after I gave it to her since other girls at school had been giving her all kinds of wild information about periods, acne, underarm odor etc. It also opened up terrific communication between the two of us. She thanked me for giving her a book that answered all her personal questions without her having to ask."
5,Read this with your daughter!!!,"I bought this book yesterday for my 10 year old daughter, and she read it cover-to-cover in one day! I am a Registered Nurse, and I can assure you that the information included in this book is right on target. My daughter is just entering puberty, and this book answered questions that she didn't even know she had! We also had the opportunity to have a nice long discussion about the many topics covered. After she finished, she told me: ""Mom, you shouldn't wash your face with bar soap."" :} She's an expert already! Thanks, American Girl!"
5,ANOTHER AWESOME BOOK!!!,I'm 12 so I have been going through ALOT of changes and this has been a great help!!!
5,learning,My daughter liked this book she is 10yrs old and her body is changing and there is alot of information for her.I'm glad I purchased this book
5,A great transition book,"This is the perfect book for both parents and daughters to ease into the ""talks"". The information is very personal in nature, but the only hot-button issue, for some, is the information on getting your period. The rest is all about how to take care of your body, everything from deoderant to haircare. There is no information about sex in this book.I gave it to my daughter when she was nine and she and her friends are still reading it two years later. This is a great book for parents and children, it makes you realize that you don't need to jump in and tell them ""everything"" at an early age, you can ease into it."
4,Good book,I bought this book for my 11 and 12 year old girls. They are very interested in it and seem to understand it all. It helps when there are questions that they are embarrassed to ask the parent. We have been going over it together and I am very pleased with my purchase
5,Answers for Girls,"Ordered for 11 yr old granddaughter.....absolutely marvelous...well illustrated and answers questions girls ""worry"" about....very,very informative and also makes girls ""think""!"
2,Too graphic,I looked at several pages of this book online as far as it would let me. I was very disappointed at how graphic parts of the book were when I actually received and reviewed it. It's no wonder that as a potential buyer I wasn't allowed to see some of the content! I'm glad I didn't send it directly to my grand daughter. I don't think all of this book is appropriate for the age group of 9-12. Buyer Beware!
2,Whoa,"I don't find it necessary to buy a book on this; kids are generally self taught and most kids probably find this less than necessary and rather cheesy. It has tips on how to brush your teeth: I hope, that kids could brush their teeth sufficiently by the time they can even read the book. Everything we didn't know from this book, is rather unnecessary like the shapes boobs can grow into, quite... informing? The kids who would probably do need this are the ones who are probably alienated from sex education but probably would be over-whelmed by cartoon diagrams of kids using tampons. It terrified me."
4,A GOOD Book,"My friend had this book and I asked to borrow it. I read it back to front about ten times or more. I really liked the book the first two times I read it but after a while it got kind of boring. It tells you to brush your teeth and how to comb your hair. It told me things I already knew. I wanted it to go more in depth about menstruation, instread of just three pages worth. This book gave me a taste of growing up, but I would buy a book like The Period Book, or Period. if you are eleven or older. Though I have to give this book credit for what it is, and for what it is, it's a great book. I would recommend it for girls 8-10 and their mothers."
5,Just what she needed,"This was a great fit for my 11 year old. It does not go into great detail, but opens the door for conversation. She read it front to back within hours of me giving it to her. She still picks it up and reads from it and refers to it in our conversations."
3,A little over whelmed with the content,I bought this for my just 10 year old daugther who is very curious about growing up and becoming a woman. I think it would be a great resource for more mature girls but I found some of it unappropriate for my daughter. There is a LOT of detail in the book . . . with anything from how to shave your legs and cleanliness to how to use pads and tampons. Some of the diagrams are graphic. I would not call myself a conservative person. I will hold on to this until my daughter is mature enough for all of its content. I would like to see a version of this book that leaves out some of the more advanced topics that a daughter should learn from her mother.
3,"Good Idea, but should start earlier and be split into two volumes","I bought this book thinking it would help me to reinforce the need for certain personal hygiene routines in my growing child. Unfortunately, it also goes rather explicitly into some areas of puberty and beyond that I feel she is much too young to have to know about just yet. I was disappointed that it was all in one book. I would have liked to see it in two volumes. One for personal habits up to the onset of puberty, and then one for the all important changes that happen to girls and onwards.I appreciate the fact that girls are maturing younger, but feel that a split volume would be more appropriate. I am disappointed that the authors/publishers did not take into account the fact that it is important for younger girls to start taking an interest in personal hygiene habits, but that it is not yet the majority of them who are starting puberty early."
3,all right for a younger girl,"I first read this book when I was 10. I already knew about most of the thing in it. The things I was more curious to learn about, such as your period, weren't talked about much. I would recomened it to a 8-10 year old who wants an indroduction to how her body will change. It has little use to a girl who is 11 or older."
5,Easy to understand,"This is a great book to share with my daughter. It's light, colorful and easy words for a preteen. It was recommeded from friends and after checking it out at the library, I bought it so I can share certain chapters at the appropriate times."
5,Great for growing up and passing on!,"My mom bought me this book when I was around eight years old. I'm 21 now and I've passed on my copy to one of my nieces and purchased a copy for the other. I thought this book was awesome at explaining all the things that were about to happen to me and helped me prepare. It does not only include period information, but it has information on nutrition, pimples, bras, hygiene and everything a girl needs to know. Of course, the book should not be used alone, but in conjunction with a parent's guidance. The book taught me the basics so that I knew what questions to ask. Since my mother gave me the book, I also felt the confidence to go to her with all the questions I had. It's a great bonding book and a great learning book."
5,Must have,"This book is a great resource for all growing girls. It has been around for a very long time, and I have gifted it to many. I had it for my oldest daughter, and now for my youngest. There is nothing it doesn't address, and it is so easy for them to understand. This is a must have!"
2,Another Cinemascope Dud,"I always said that cinemascope was responsible for some of the strangest movies to come out of the 1950s. This movie is a prime example. It is unclear what this movie is really supposed to be about. The plot, which centers around a psychopathic killer on the loose, continually veers off course like an airplane without radar. Pat O'Brien looked as board as the rest of us watching this movie."
2,The bottle is dirty inside,"I received the olive oil and soap dispenser set and they are beautifully painted and lovely. However, the inside of the olive oil bottle is filthy with dirt. I am soaking it and I do not have a bottle scrubber and will have to purchase one to make this item useable. I have never received a ""new"" item that has actual dirt in it!"
2,How to really watch this movie,"Get ""Knife In The Water"" and a documentary about Lizzy Borden, throw in some lesbians and some Ibsen, a short sleezy soft-porn film and take THAT home from the library. It couldn't be any more disjointed and silly than this mess. The actors are all phoning it in. If you want to see a film chopped into episodes, get ""Kwaidan."" If you want to see one where the bits all fit together, get ""Pulp Fiction."" I think ""Weight"" was supposed to be scary, but it's ridiculous. They wanted to throw people in the water off Halifax but they had to film the swimming scenes in Mexico -- because if you jump in the water off Halifax, you will freeze to death. Or you will come up screaming and covered in goose-bumps and that's not so attractive with a bikini. This thing is about as scary and goofy as ""The Blair Witch Project."""
4,Half a great film...,"The historical half of this film is riveting, with a fantastic performance by Sarah Polley. For her alone this film is worth watching, which is why i give it four stars despite the modern day story which is terrible and completly uninteresting. I would even reccomend just fastfowarding past those parts. They should have dropped the modern day plot and made a movie about the murders, then it would have gotten five stars from me. As it was, it still had me thinking about it days later."
1,The 'Weight' Will Bring You Down,"Two couples embark on a wet and wild adventure! ""The Weight of Water"" should have been called ""Girls Gone Wild Infinity."" A silly English woman (Elizabeth Hurley) sunbathes topless in front of everybody, no shame! Sean Penn is a poet who wears suits on a boat that leaks and that floats in the middle of nowhere. He also mumbles philosophical mumbo-jumbo every other scene and drinks wine. Why are they on a boat trying to solve a murder that happened centuries ago on a New England island? Of course they don't solve what happened even though the photographer (Catherine McCormack) has flashbacks on what really happened. But is she psychic and are we supposed to fall for the cheesiness? I didn't, I just fell asleep and got a good two hours worth."
2,Max Factor Mascara,"I was very unhappy with the product I received, it was old & dried up. I tried to write a review earlier but it suggested that I try to resolve my problem, so I got a return # and sent the product back on October 11, 2012 and I still have not received my refund!! Very, very unhappy customer!!!!Max Factor Lash Perfection Mascara, Deep Blue 704 .13 Fl Oz (4 Ml)"
2,Musta got the wrong blade or they are full of it,"I run a small cabinet shop, got this blade as a glueline rip ( meaning very little kerf travel, smooth cut ) and it sucks. Not only is there no hook in teeth design, which makes it very hard to push thru ( even softwoods )but there is a tendency for product to move away from fence while feeding, very difficult to keep a perfectly straight rips going...and as everybody knows, if you dont get a perfect rip, your glue joint will suck the big one. I found myself having to make the random length rip, then set fence back 1/16th and run it thru again. This helped, gave me ""good enough"" but boy my arms were tired at the end of the day after 300brd feet....would not recommend this blade for any reason, other than for a upper body workout ymmv"
5,Deskbells are great!,"As an elementary school music teacher, I couldn't be more please with these desk bells. They are high-quality with clear tone. For my youngest students (K-2nd) these bells are much easier to play than most mallet instruments. Their only drawback is that they sound with only one dynamic level. Whether you strike them lightly or firmly, the result is the same. Otherwise, they are great for a child's first attempt at playing instruments while ""reading"" music."
2,Questioning....,"This book is very different from all of the accounts of Kundalini which I have found, with a down home flavor to the whole mysterious thing. An odd parallel story is the Lehman's account of their son, whom they constantly describe as a sociopath and criminal. (This continues in the book reviews following, which each of them contribute to.) This does not comport with my understanding of enlightenment and compassion. Caveat Emptor."
2,Not enough strength or grip...,"I got one of these to help me after I had major surgery. I have better than average hand and arm strength, but I found this particular model to be hard to operate (I can't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it). Normal sized cans (like soup or beans) slipped out of its pitiful grip. I wound up using it just to roll things to myself when I dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash. This is definitely a lightweight... too light for much real use. I should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more."
5,All sides shown...,"The Pointer Sisters are an amazing band. Have a listen to the tracks here and you'll hear the most diverse group in the history of music. It may not have all the hits, but this cd does a good job of showing what an amazing talent they are. Most of the groups Blue Thumb hits are here along with later highlights. If all you know is I'm So Excited... Listen up!"
1,"Anemic collection -- more Bonnie, please!!","This is a very anemic and disparate collection of Pointer Sisters music throughout their career. This hardly does this unique group justice. The only thing that is really special here is the re-release of Bonnie Pointer's solo work. Why doesn't someone just re-release the first two CD's of Bonnie's work on Motown?If you are looking for the best of the ""Pointer Sisters,"" I suggest you do a search on Yahoo. There are a CD's of the sisters' early work on Blue Thumb, as well as their work with Richard Perry through the 80's. You can also find imports of the sister's best CD's.Unless you're a die hard fan, like me, and love Bonnie Pointer, that is the only reason to buy this. And for the price, this is not a bad deal. Looks like this is the only place one is going to find Bonnie Pointer on CD right now."
3,There are better books out there.,"First off, I want to say that this book isn't the worst I've read. It's well organized and written fairly clear. The main problem I have with it is the cost!I originally thought this book was an OK introduction until I readAbstract Algebraby Beachy and Blair andAbstract Algebraby Herstein. I recommend the first for those who need to work on proof writing, and the second for those who have a solid foundation in abstract mathematics and aren't afraid of a little rigor. Both of them are cheaper, and do a much better job exposing the material.The only reason I'm keeping the text is because chapters XIV, XV and XVI seem like they have interesting applications (crystallography, cryptography, etc.)"
4,absolutely love this program.,I originally bought the software as part of flash class work.I will admit that I've used it for other things as well.I just recently finished an awesome Flash intro that I started with this program.
4,Easily create and manage powerful flash content ..,"Great .. There are many built-in animated effects , no more hard work"
5,The Devotions for Dieters is excellent.,"I was given this devotional as a gift. It has been a tremendous source of strength in my weight loss... I combine it with Free to Be Thin ... God is ultimately the healer in this area, but with tools like this to help seek Him, healing is possible."
4,Good incites on Evolution and Creationism,"In this book Kitcher does a good job of not only showing the bad side of Scientific Creationism, but the good side of Evolution as well. It had a brief introduction to Evolution that was informative but basic to what you would learn in the first few weeks of a college level biology class. All around a good read."
1,Just a collection,"Don't let this disk fool you. It is just a collection put out by the record label to try and generate some cash and is an odd mix at that. If you want the entire self-titled album by the band, you need to get the album titled Classic Collection; it is the complete first album with selections from their second, Subway Serenade. The picture of the band line-up on the cover is the tip off-- it appears to be some mix of Looking Glass and Starz and to my knowledge, never existed. Pick a different disk."
1,don't buy this book,"this book is very old, it was wtitten on 2oo2, all the information is not useful today. if you want a book in order to learn web, try to find another book or some tutorials in youtube.i have it at home and think i will throw it away."
5,Nice Helmet!!!,"I can't say too much about this helmet in thatI have not been in a ""bike"" accident ever beforeor since buying this (and hope that I don't getinto one either); but, it fits really well, and I didmy research b4 I bought it to see which helmethas (or had) the best rating in crash tests, andthis be it (well, the ""citi"" series)!!!This is not one of the ""really cool"" looking helmetsthat I see a lot of ""bikers"" around town using orwearing, and I sort of look like a ""geek"" with iton, but it surrounds my whole head, so I feelconfident should I ever get hit by a car, anotherbiker, if a pedestrian walks into me or my path, orI crash out myself, that my whole head will beprotected...Not much else I can say about this in like I said,I have not been in an accident with it or before,and I am not ""dummy crash testing"" them - yipes."
3,Not for a smaller head :(,"Had to return the helmet, but wanted to share some details for the prospective online purchaser.I love the shape and look of this helmet, but it is NOT designed for a smaller head (one size does NOT fit all). Unfortunately my head seems to run a bit on the small size, and no amount of adjustment could make this work (not to mention I looked like a mushroom head from Mario brothers). Even with the tightest strap and dial adjustment, this helmet slides around on my head too much to provide proper protection.Again, I love the general look, and the GLOW colour is great, but the fit just didn't work. Also the photo for the GLO colour shows screening in the front vents, but the actual helmet did not have this (different from appearance in the photo).I ended up getting a SCHWINN ""URBAN"" helmet to replace this, as the fit was better for my smaller mellon."
3,"""True North"" an amazing storie of the 'Underground Railroad'","""True North"" By Kathryn Lasky shows the overall courage of a slave and abolitionist. Together, Lucy and Afrika follow the North Star to freedom. Along the way they meet traitors, slave catchers, and dogs. They also use positivity, teamwork, and bravery to escape hard times, and especially Edmund de Rosey. All of these thrilling adventures turn this book into a book you can't set down. You're so intrigued that you don't notice that time flies by like the speed a humming bird can flaps their wings. ""True North"" shows the dramatic difference between today and during the slavery days. If I lived in the slavery days,one question would always drag through my head. If they had to fight for their freedom and knows what it feels like, then why are they having us fight for ours?"
1,Abominable Book,"True North is possibly the most abominable novel in the entire cosmos. The two plots (plot 1 being the dillapidated Lucy and her disgusting grandfather, plot 2 is about the slave Afrika escaping from the slave catchers) are underdeveloped pieces of horrible atrocities. The two main characters, Lucy and Afrika, only exacerbated the horror of the vile book. The plots were so simple, I guessed the ending within 20 pages."
3,Looks great....,"I really like this character and it's the all gold version from the 'Revenge of the Sith' movie. The head, arms and legs can pop off fairly easy so I wouldn't use it for battles."
4,Nice but could be better made.,The seller performed wonderfully and shipped this out quickly! I don't think the quality is up to par with other figures in the Star Wars collection though. Still it's a nice addition to the SW collection!
4,What a Keeper,"This album is noisy and it makes me want to dance. Is funky the right word? It is guitar driven, funny and the vocals are a unique ball of fuzz. I am hooked and it was only recently that I learned about the band itself. I recommended this band especially the album to anyone who also likes Kasabian, Flannelmouth, Boy or Franz Ferdinand for their energy, massive sound and arena enthusiasm. My favourite tracks are ""Go home get Down"", ""Blood on our Hands"" and ""Cold War"". Perhaps you will like them too."
4,Well....it rocks,"I dunno how hyped this band is...I heard about them on a message board and checked this record out. The reason I mention hype is, I think this band is a band that is in danger of being over-hyped and as a result hated by lots of people. I've already seen one review on this page complaining about the ""fuzz"". If you go into this expecting too much, it'd certainly be disappointing.Simply put, first and formost this album simply rocks. It isn't cerebral, it isnt' artist, it just rocks. It starts rocking and it doesn't stop until the end. From what I can tell, it's a bassist/vocalist and a drummer, with some possible keyboards thrown in for fun. The overall sound of the album has somewhat of a retro/dated feel to it. Whoever wrote the songs sure knows how to write good, heavy, driving, hooky riffs.So, if you're thinking of checking this album out, I recommend it. Just be sure and go into it without too many expectations and just be ready for some good rock that rocks."
4,picture peels....fast,"bought this for my 6 mth old and after a few times sucking on the pieces (as all babies do) the pics are coming off....fast!! she still loves it and gets excited when we demonstrate the animal sounds, that is until she sucks the animal right off the cutout!! would still recommend, but don't expect to hand this down or put out in the yard sale one day!"
4,"Nice, sturdy puzzle","I bought this for my 9 month old daughter for Christmas. The recommended age is 12 months and up. The pieces are big enough I am not afraid of her choking on them, but once she mouthed them for a little while, the edges of the pictures started dissolving... Not what I wanted to happen to such an expensive puzzle. I bought it on sale, so I am pleased with the value for the sale price, but I do think I will wait a little while before she gets to play with it unsupervised."
1,Wood back almost instantly peeled,My daughter (13 months) received this toy as a present and really loved playing with it. It's very educational and I loved the wood structure of it. But in just a couple of days the back of the main wood frame started peeling leaving raw edges on the surface and sides. Just what you would need to get a splinter. So now we don't use the board any more. But my daughter still continues to play with the removable pieces.
1,Disappointing!,"The puzzle is very cute and made from durable ply wood. I really wanted to like this product, BUT the animals are not painted, but stickers were used. My daughter chewed on the pieces and I saw that after a few minutes, the sticker came of at the sides and she probably swallowed parts of it. Can only recommend it if your kid is not putting anything in its mouth anymore. But at that point, it will probably have more fun with more complex wooden puzzle than this."
4,Puzzle,I bought this for my 1 year old son. He loves picking up the pieces by the large knobs as they fit perfectly in his little hands. I would recommend this to any parent. Good product for the price.
5,This recording should be required listening for all singers!,"Not only should it be required listening for all singers but for for all arrangers, orchestrators, conductors, recording engineers, band and orchestra players and finally ALL those people who purport that they are experts in being able to define the real definition of phrasing, syncopation, the difference in marcato, staccato, crescendo, climax (for non-musicians and journalists for that matter), you don't build to a crescendo. Crescendo means to build (crescendo) to a climax. Decrescendo means to relax or soften or diminish gradually from the climax...this album is an entire education in how to sing and swing this type of music. It's Perfect!! It should be used by Paramedics and E.R. Docs to restart failing hearts. It's too bad the pharmaceuticul houses can't bottle it. They'd make another fortune. Wonderful! Marvelous! Precious! Timeless! Irreplaceable! And in the the most simple terms....Excitingly Right!!!"
2,They ruined my favorite!!!!!!,"This used to be the best upbeat Sinatra record. It was a perfect concept album: a collection of swinging tunes about dancing that ends up with the ballad ""The Last Dance"". Perfect closure.Not anymore. Now the damned thing - Energizer Bunny like - just keeps on going! Four more tracks, some from a different session! Just cause some corporate jerk wanted to charge a few bucks extra.At least they didn't add those infernal ""alternate takes"" that plague CD reissues these days.If I were you I'd hunt down the old CD or even the LP release. They are much more satisfying records."
1,The Phantom of the Opera??????,This is a discrace to Andrew Lloyd-Webber! Does anyone really think this was meant to be a Jazz piece?
2,There are other better options,"I bought this blade for $20 on clearance at my Rocker store.I have a well-tuned Powermatic saw and the cut quality is visibly poor. I have an older resharpened Freud ripping blade and a cheap DeWalt 40 tooth combination blade, both of which do a FAR better job ripping than the CMT. I am very suprised considering CMT's reputation but not every product a company makes can be a winner. Even at $20, its not worth it."
2,Worth reading but beware of too much anti-Lincolnism,"The book definately strips away the mythic status that has been bestowed on Lincoln over the years. However, it tends to go the opposite way too far and villifies him mercilessly. The tome becomes a constant, annoying barrage. The book does make good points, however, about the Lincoln-Douglas debates and Lincoln's failures in life up to that point. Serious students of Lincoln and the Civil War should read it. The author could have been more balanced, though, and admitted that Lincoln wasn't a slobbering buffoon. Also the author would have been well advised to leave out the obsence anti-religious tone that infected many pages."
1,RAP you call rap music????,"I came looking to buy this album until I realized it had this C-rap rap (C-rap, rap same thing)on it - If you consider rap as being music there is something definitely wrong with you - You should try to become civilized and get an education - Take this C-rap out of the album and you might have a decent album but until then I wouldn't spend a penny on it"
4,Ladykillers,"This movie wasn't that great but the soundtrack was excellent. The instrumental at the end of the film as it faded out was very ""quite, yet not quite"". It gave me a kind of feeling that really invoked some meaningful thought."
3,My cats think this is a toy!!,"My cats are the kind who like to break everything apart. If I get a regular round bed, they play with it and move it all around the room.So I thought since this bed has a base, they won't be able to move it and would love to sleep on it.However, they separated the upper bed from it's base and were just playing with it.One of my cats preferred to just go under the bed all the while.Finally, we just tied the corners of the bed with cords and tried to stuff something under the bed.I have 3 cats. Only 1 of my cats now uses it sometimes. The other 2 are not interested in this bed.Also, it's a bed only for a medium sized cat."
3,"Good, but not as good as the DVD","As stated not as good as the DVD, which is posted on Ice Cubes online TV website."
3,Solid Teaching Aid - but be prepared,"I purchased this book, without having any background in programming in any computer language, except a small amount of Basic & HTML, hoping for fast results. The truth is that although the book is comprehensive and user friendly, it relys heavily on a pre existing knowledge of the subject matter and is really NOT for the absolute beginner. My only other observation would be the constant ""I'll cover that part later"" aspect of the text, which is very frustrating, and makes the reader want to skip ahead to consolidate learning. I would certainly recommend this book, but only as an addition to the library of someone who knew a great deal about Delphi first, without which 21 days is optomistic at best!"
5,The Prefect Gift.,Have recieved this DVD in excellent condition and before due date. Its a great film for every one to watch and really understand the meaning of Christmas. Great entertainment for all. Where would we be if we took Christmas out of the season? I highly recomend the seller too.
2,Not what they used to be,Must admit that it has been sometime since I last looked at a Chilton - but this book was nothing like I remember. There really is nothing of value in the book. Could have saved a tree.
2,Don't waste time,"If nothing else this book is extremely annoying because the other flip flops so much. She says to accept yourself than she details her latest diet. She says fat girls can be healthy but then talks about overeating and junk food. I am currently doing a life style over haul and this book was a terrible thing to read. I understand that some overweight people are healthy, but this book was not an example of that."
1,WHY ARE WE CELEBRATING BEING UNHEALTHY????????????????,"Fat women will read this and think it's OK to be unhealthy now. Does this idiot Wendy have any idea how many obesity related DEATHS there are every year?? Thousands!! She treats it like it's a joke, like it's something cute, like it's something you SHOULD rebel again. Wendy, you idiot, maybe these people telling you to lose some weight care about you and your health. At one point she suggests substituting carrots for Krisbe Kreme. WTF???????? If you want to feel better about being unhealthy than this is the book for you. If you want to actually get healthy and live a happy life this book will only delude you. But for some, ignorance is bliss."
5,Choose to Be Yourself,"Wendy Shanker's book ""The Fat Girl's Guide to Life"" is at once funny and poignant. Anyone who has ever packed on a few (or a few hundred) extra pounds can relate to her stories of failed diets, biting comments from friends and relatives, and what a depressing experience it is to shop with forever thin friends. As other reviewers have mentioned, the chapter on the Duke Diet & Fitness Center is alone worth the price of the book. But as much as the book is full of humorous essays on being what society considers ""fat"", at its heart ""The Fat Girl's Guide to Life"" is really about becoming comfortable with who you are. We have a choice, as women, as to whether we will let society define who we are and what we look like, or whether we take responsibility for those decisions ourselves. Wendy Shanker has made her choice and we should all thank her for being bold enough share the journey with us."
2,not current,it isn't current with ideas...was expecting something with more usable patterns...it's interesting from a historic perspective but the directions were based on what was common knowledge at the time it was written
5,Great Mold !!!,"Worked Great!!! Candy popped out with ease. I did these in red chocolate. After the candy popped out, I went over the middle stem with a small coating of melted chocolate and sprinkled them with fine yellow sugar (in the cake decorating section). It looked like pollen. Of course, you had to take a paintbrush and brush off the yellow sugar on the red where it didn't stick. Everyone loved them and they went with our ""Lily"" theme."
1,beware the 80's squawking,"Very disappointing.Leslie West is an outstanding guitarist, and can really grab your gut - listen to his late 60's-early 70's work in Mountain. (West, Bruce & Laing, however, is disappointing - too 70's ""let's get drunk and fight and scr__"" clone band-sounding. Avoid.)He shows his amazing talents on this disc, too; but then things are spoiled with - how to describe? -squawking/eeeekkking/oooorrrking at the end of riffs, sounding like the clone bands of the 80's.Too bad, because this disc had the potential to be great.Instead, put your money into Mountain albums, including Avalanche, Climbing, and Nantucket sleighride. Mountain's Woodstock set is good, too."
3,Great Look. Bad Quality,"The shoe looks great and is very comfortable. However, it fell apart in less than a year. The leather started falling apart at the seams and the sole literally detached from the rest of the shoe.Its a shame that Skechers has come down to this. I just bought a new pair of Aldos to replace these."
4,DER SCHUE,"This is a fine product. It took me some time to find it, including hunts through sports stores and other retail facilities to find this ""schuh. (Tao Oxford) should be considered by all who are in the hunt for a great sneeker.I love it."
4,Good Quaility,I am very pleased with the quality of this runner. Fabric was very pretty and we use it on the communion table at church.
3,Eye of the Tiger,"We return again to the story of Rocky opening with the ending of Rocky II, yet actually continuing a couple years later I believe. There are some interesting things happening here, yet what made the first two movies so great was Rocky's character. Here, that character is dropped for a more intelligent, less innocent man who is certainly more aggressive guy who is less appealing to fans of the first film. Mr. T is an interesting guy to play the part of the new ""villain"". He talks alot of trash and says ""I pity the fool"". Carl Weathers is probably the best actor in this film, as he is neither annoying, or very loud and mean. DVD once again only has a trailer. Surprise. The mood of this film might even be darker than Rocky II, yet the length is so short that it's more upbeat, and sort of confusing. Rocky loses to Mr. T and then 20 mintues later fights him again. I guess it would've been boring if it was much longer, but it just seems too short for a Rocky film."
1,How to ruin a francise in 5 steps,This film should never have been made. This is the same old stuff rehashed. The only difference is that we have a slightly older Rocky doing the same old boring training scenes and same boxing pattern. I've had nightmares because of this film
2,Uh-oh....bad sequel alert!,"Ever notice how Rocky 1 and 2 are 2 hours long then Rocky 3,4, and 5 barely scrape 90 minutes? Could it be that there is nothing to say? This is where Stallone spends more time getting other people (Hulk Hogan, Mr. T) noticed for their own futures. This movie lacks any real passion and the fight sequences are bad. the whole ""eye of the tiger"" thing is very funny indeed. Sure, Mr. T, hit me with all you've got. I have the eye of the tiger and feel no pain now. Laughable."
2,Pedestrian hard rock album,"I can't get all these glowing reviews.I'm not nostalgic ad I don't think UFO ended the day Michael Schenker left. Much on the contrary, the MECHANIX album was the first UFO album I ever heard and it got me going into this great band.But to say that this NO PLACE TO RUN is as good as anything before it's sheer... madness! This is a pedestrian hard rock effort, there's even one amazing Paul Chapman solo (thing that he would do in later albums). The songs are lifeless, terribly bearing a pop feel. In the liner notes the badn says they were going through great presure from the record company to realease hit songs and this, combined with George Martin producing, maybe was crucial.Anyway, this album was a great dissapointment for me."
5,A must read for anyone about to give birth or married to someone about to give birth,"Dr Grant is a life saver. As a father of two, I can say that watching my wife before Dr. Grant joined us and after was night and day. This book provides information that is extremely helpful in making choices about your birthing plan in a very easy to read, understandable and entertaining way. I could have done without the description of ancient rituals to make men feel pain equivalent to child birth, but it did make me appreciate what my wife was going through all the more. A must buy."
2,"Overrated, but cheaper shave soap.","I have no complaints about this product per se, but considering you can get shave soap at your local walmart for $1.50, why bother with this stuff? It does smell nice, but it also didn't last long for me (about 3 weeks), whereas the wally world stuff is lasting longer and is 1/4 the price."
4,I like it,"I am new to two edge razors and using soap instead of foam and I started with this one and I like it. I haven't tried other soaps yet which is why I subtract one star, if I gave 5 now how could I top it if another soap works better for me, so dont take this as an expression of dissatisfaction with the product. I have nothing to complain about this."
5,Fantastic,"Just recieved my Col. Conk Bay Rum shaving soap, i made the decision to switch, ive been using British soaps for years, i got tired of paying upwards of $25 for the same 2.25oz soaps. Quality ofCol. Conk seems to be better, much richer lather. Spreads on face with badger hair brush much easier. I absolutely reccomend this product to anyone who wet shaves, beginning, or the ol' timers."
3,Nice lather,"I must say, this is my first shaving soap, and the lather it produces is nice. The complaint I do have is that there is barely an aroma. I understand this is shave soap, not aftershave, but a stronger scent couldn't hurt."
