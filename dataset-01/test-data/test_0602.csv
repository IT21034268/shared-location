4,Awesome fun,Got this for my 12 year old son and he loves it. We have all 3 now and all my boys love to play them.
3,"Fun, but very repetitive.","This game started out a lot of fun. The combat mechanics were different, and the adventure quality of jumping from rooftop to rooftop was extremely entertaining. But after about 5 hours of Alert a guard, run, hide, wait, repeat, the game list it's novelty fast. I had such high expectations of this game, too..."
5,AC,"Assassin's Creed is one of the games that will never leave my collection. I bought this game as soon as the price dropped and I've been addicted to it ever since. The way the game is design is the best i've seen. The way Altar (main character)moves, climbs and fights and of course assassinates are very addicting and make it even more interesting. The graphics and details are stunning and would leave you speechless as you play. The cities are HUGE and the storyline is good. You can go where ever you want or kill whom ever you want to. Just remember, you're an assassin, not a serial killer!"
2,Not worth the money.....,"My 3 year old was so excited to see that they had come out with a princess christmas movie so as soon as it came out, we rushed out to get it. Within minutes she was bored with the old clips and even found a few scenes scary. She has never watched it again and it was a waste of money in my opinion. I would not recommend for a disney princess lover as its not what you think."
1,princess flop,"Me and my daughter were very excited to watch the movie and we waited and waited for the jasmine story about christmas and it never happened she was just in a song. Nor, did you see really any princess in the DVD. They should of named this the disney christmas movie. It was cheap in the voices and animations. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR A PRINCESS LOVER."
5,My daughter loved it!,"I know that there isn't new material on it. But the stories are pretty good. And the songs are super-cool.I love this dvd, too."
1,too bad I can't leave a -5 star rating,"Don't let the title fool you. There is apparently NO new animation here. Simply a rehash of old 1935's animation and cut sequences from previous Disney films set to a new soundtrack and music score.What really gets me is when they are actually forced to create new animation (so the princesses can introduce each rehashed clip) that they apparently hired a low paid website designer to animate them using Macromedia Flash. It's like the whole DVD is nothing but a collection of the special features you get on other DVDs.This movie was done as quickly and low budget as possible to milk the Christmas holidays. Very, very disappointed as was my 4 year old. They even felt the need to completely remove any attachment to the real meaning of Christmas, going as far as to call it ""Chrissymas"" in one sequence!Do not buy this disappointing DVD."
3,My daughter loves it!,Not all about the Princesses. A lot of clips from past shows...some not including the Princesses. This doesn't seem to bother my 4 year old. She still loves it and get's very excited when Ariel's parts are on. I would recommend it.
2,Disney Princess Video,The quality of the video was fine. The content quality was not what we expected. We were hoping for a Disney Princess Christmas of Enchantment with all the princesses together. Most of the video content did not even have anything to do with a princess. They were individual narrators for silly clips of poor quality animation and still picture stories. Felt that this was a rip off by Disney. Unfortunately the 2 and 4 year old were fine with it.
2,2.5 Stars - It Was Just OK.,"My daughter, almost 2 1/2, is really, really into the Disney Princesses. I encourage her to notice that they are smart, kind, generous, etc. and not so much on the ""princess"" part. I expected a lot from this DVD, since it was the big holiday release, but in all honesty, my daughter got really bored, really fast, and I honestly can't blame her. The Snow White story, though cute and very retro, wasn't a real attention grabber and had no educational value at all. Truth be told, she liked the last story best and only because the horses saved the day! It wasn't the worst, but wasn't the best either. Save your money and buy Rudolph instead."
1,VERY cheap diamond,The chain is so think and I can barely see it. And the stones are not clear at all. They don't even look like diamonds. It is probably the worst necklace I have ever got.
1,Never received a credit on merchandise return,"When I received the Bluetooth Wireless Headset, I connected it and it did not work. I brought it to a Verizon store and they could not get it to work either. I returned the item and was told they would give me back a credit on my Amazon account and I never received the credit. It is now eight months later and they don't even respond to my emails to them. Never buy anything from them."
3,"OK, Shipment",My bluetooth was shiped to me on time but I was disapointed that it did not come with an instruction booklet.
2,Headset turns itself on!,"I liked the look of the headset because it matched my phone. However, the unit turns itself on when it is in my purse and will occasionally dial the last number I dialed in the phone while in my purse. The sound volume is poor unless surroundings are quiet and I usually want to use it when I'm in my car. I will go with a plantronics even though it doesn't look as good."
2,BlueTooth Cavity,"I was not impressed by this product. It does not fit snuggly to the ear, but flops around on your ear looking cumbersome and ""dorky"". I cannot use it as it does not communicate with my phone well, and keeps asking me to reset a password which I don't even have anymore. I am sorry I made this purchase."
2,Not that great....,"I mainly got this headset because it matches my pink razr phone. The voice quality is good, but it does not stay on my ear!!! It keeps slipping off, and if I do manage to keep it on, it pokes the back of my ear. Also, the signal hasn't been great sometimes even though I'm right next to my phone. My advice: see what else is out there!"
1,better off sticking to the O'Dell series,"Should I barf now or later??!! If I wanted to read a harlequin romance I would have bought one. I couldn't help rolling my eyes at almost every page. It is very sappy, empty, sweet, predictable and cheap. I sure like the O'dell mysteries a whole lot better."
3,"Lots of Bible, little else","I bought this book to try to research for a paper I am writing. There is a lot of Bible verses, and little else."
3,"Well structured, well backed in scripture","I really enjoyed this book. This book deals with the four targets of Satan, (mind, body, will, heart/conscience) and the tools he uses for each one. This book was very well structured and everything he writes is back up with scripture. How do we combat Satan in the home, in our lives, in our relationships, and what wepons we use, (the word of God?) All these issues are brought up in Mr Wiersbe's book."
5,Great insights for resisting the enemy's attack.,Don't enter the battle blindfolded! You have to know and understand the enemy in order to prevail. Easy reading laced with verses to back up the author's strategy. This book gives proactive Biblical insights to resist and overcome Satan's attack. He that is in us is greater than he that is in the world!
4,Great book for fighting the devil,"This is a great little instruction manual for fighting the devil and his lies and deceptions. Its loaded with scripture and wisdom from a great author. Chapter 6 called Dont give Satan a beachhead was especially helpful as its when we are discouraged that demonic forces jump in. So often have I been discouraged and angry over something, and at times the thoughts run wild. I have often blamed this on my sinful nature, but this may be inaccurate as the devil and his servants could be joining in. Great book."
4,"""OldTimer Likes This First Person Shooter""","I'm not computer savvy like many of the reviewers of this game, I couldn't recognize a gigabyte if it bit me, and I would hazard a guess that most of the reviewers are my sons' ages, but I do know what I like. Since I retired, I've played many of this type of game, and while the training mode can be a bit frustrating, the remainder of the game is well thought out, and fun to play. It is neither too easy nor too hard, moves along well, and the graphics are adequate. I haven't completed it yet, but the sections I've finished were engaging, and I look forward to the next level. All in all, a good game, worth the money."
4,"Very nice indeed, Doug knows his juice","Doug lives here in my home town, writes a column for the local paper. So I'm an old fan. This is a book I can recommend without reservations, I only give it 4 stars because I wish there were a few more chapters.Combine this one with Andrea Immer's 'Great Wine Made Simple' and you're good to go."
4,Vast improvement over no gel seat at all.,"I checked several reviews for gel seat covers before deciding on this one. I have tried no others, so I have no comparison, but I'm very happy with this one. I've been using it for about a month, and the comfort level is such an improvement over having nothing there at all. It does have the ""slip-proof"" material on the bottom, but it still slides around to a minute degree as you're mounting the bike, so watch out for that. Otherwise I have no complaints so far."
2,Underwhelmed,"Expected much more comfort from this product , I guess its better than having nothing on the seat. So take that for what its worth"
5,dark journey of an artist's coming of age,"This is a disturbing novel. It's unsettling. It has sharp corners, shadows. It explores the seamy underside of the unconscious. The young artist has to go on vision quest through the valley of her inner and outer demons in order to emerge whole and empowered, a heroine and artist in the end. The story functions as a vision quest. A young girl in American suburbia with a bouffant mother, an assinine (and threatening) stepfather, tries to use her art to reconstruct and resurrect her lost and damned sculptor father, and doing so, finds herself. The surreal symbolism is effective with its many references to the underwater world, mating walruses, sharks, drowning. The bathtub where the sculptor father drowns becomes the sea from which the reborn heroine emerges. Brilliant, cerebral, risk-taking writing from the most innovative young writers of our time. After you read this novel, you will never look at pizza or bowling balls the same way again."
2,old books,"My friend was very pleased I found this book, his father had it as a small child but I was told it was in good condition and it was not. About 8 pages were loose in the front, the title was partially worn off, so I was a bit disappointed. Luckily, my friend was happy with it, worn, torn, and yellowed! I was happy I found it."
2,A struggle to finish,"If this had been the first Crais book I'd read I wouldn't have read any others which would have been a pity as all his previous books (except the Forgotten Man) were excellent.The Two-Minute rule (note the use of the grammatically correct hyphen) has two main characters, Holman and Pollard, who are made of cardboard and are not in the least bit interesting. The plot was okay but the end was silly. I was bored throughout most of the book and couldn't wait for it to finish.If you want good Crais then read Demolition Angel, Hostage or LA Requiem and don't read this one."
5,A new direction,"Robert Crais has been possibly my favorite detective story writer ever since I read LA Requiem - I had to read all his previous novels after finishing that one - and have kept up with every publication since. I was a tad disapponted that Two Minute Rule didn't include Elvis and Joe Pike, but once I got into the story I was totally caught up in ex-con Max Holman's quest to find out the truth about his son's death. His involvement with Katherine Pollard, the FBI agent who actually put Max behind bars for 10 years, seemed a bit of a stretch, but Crais makes you believe it could happen. The old cliche ""I couldn't put it down"" just happens to be true once again - what a read. Heartily recommended."
5,Fantastic,"Two Minute Rule is the first book I've read from Robert Crais. When I finished, I was left to wonder why I hadn't yet picked up any of his previous works. This book was fantastic. Crais grabs the reader in the first few minutes and keeps him thoroughly captivated throughout the entire book. My only real complaint was that it was over too quickly. The lead character is a career criminal who receives parole at the beginning of the story. The emotional high of personal freedom is shattered, however, when he finds that the son he really had never known had been killed immediately prior to his release. Sorrow turns to an intense desire to find the true cause behind his son's death. Crais pulls the story forward with strong character development, providing a range of emotions and motivations that spans the character set. Start to finish, this is a great story. Now, I'm off to tackle some more from Crais that I have been missing."
4,Fast paced,"This is a really fast paced read, although the game that Holman's son was playing was very predictable. This is because Holman was always harping that it was his fault that his son had been shot. The story of how Holman was busted by Pollard is almost pathetic and I really don't think that it could be true. On the other hand this is a book that you can read in a day or two without any problem."
3,Nothing to get excited about,"I've read every book in the Elvis Cole series and loved them all. The characterization is superb, the plots intricate enough to hold one's interest until the conclusion. ""Hostage"" was a departure from the familiar for Mr. Crais and he pulled it off. Another great read! Imagine my joy in receiving an advance copy of ""The Two Minute Rule"". Another great time to be had.Well, I'm more than two-thirds through the book and I can honestly say that not much has happened. I'm about to give up. There was more action in the seven page prologue than in the next three hundred pages. Also, I thought you were supposed to care about the main character; in this case, Max Holman. Well, at this point I don't care what the heck happens to Holman. He's one-dimensional at best! And wishy-washy to boot. Aww, what the heck, I gave up at page 228. Sorry, Mr. Crais, better luck next time."
1,Two Minute Rule,Unlike his other books this offering seemed to lack direction and the plot line was foolish. I could not finish the book.
4,Very entertaining!,"Great book! Couldn't put it down and finished it in just 2 days. As some other reviewers have said - the events in this book are very 'improbable', but nevertheless an excellent read."
5,Big Improvement Over Stock Antenna,With the stock antenna it took a long time to aquire the GPS Sats. Also in bad weather (rain & clouds) many times it would not receive the signal at all.I purchased this antenna and mounted it on the roof. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I never loose the GPS signal. I recently made a trip from NJ to Idaho. It performed flawlessly all the way.I absolutly recommend this antenna.I just ordered a second antenna for my work vehicle.
2,Don't purchase this via Amazon,"Although I ordered more than $100 worth of products, this product was not sent directly from Amazon. I could have purchased this product from Lowes or HD for $15. Buying it through Amazon cost me $22 ($17 + $5 shipping & handling).Be sure to see what qualifies for free shipping."
2,WAyyyyyy to much!!,"I had an unbelievably hard time getting into this book. I was really excited when I saw that it was about mobs during Prohibition and that is why I bought it. In the first 20 pages you are slapped in the face with about 100 different characters... sometimes they die, sometimes they kill, sometimes I am not entirely sure what happens to them because I cant remember who is who. I feel bad giving this book a bad review since I couldnt get through the first couple of chapters. I plan on retrying this book some time when I have more patience. Perhaps in 50 years when I retire!"
4,"Good book, interesting read","Not a waste of time, compelling and interesting to the last chapter. I would recommend this book to friends or relatives."
5,A classic of the genre,"After fifteen years in publication this book ""The Westies"" still holds its power. I read it when it came out and was blown away. Reading it again years later I am still impressed with the intimacy and also the historical framework for the story. The book has aged like fine Irish whiskey. Combine""The Westies"" together with ""Paddy Whacked,"" another book by T.J. English, and you have the full story of the Irish American gangster that puts these TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Black Donnellys"" to shame."
3,Somewhat interesting.,"This book held my attention at times, but overall as a fan of the true crime genre I was a bit disappointed. It was interesting from a historical perspective of how the Irish mob shaped the character of Hell's Kitchen, especially in the 70's and 80's. However, there were so many characters that it was hard to keep track of them, and a couple of murders that were mentioned earlier in the book were not explained until the very end. These things combined to make the book somewhat confusing and eroded my interest. It turned out to be one of those books that I liked enough to keep reading because I felt I would get cheated out of something interesting if I quit, but I felt a sense of freedom and relief when I finally finished it."
5,Too Good For Hollywood!!!,"This was one of the most venemously funny series I've ever seen on television. One reviewer summed up my feelings by saying it was ahead of its time and basically failed because the public was not ready for somehing so sophisticated, witty, wildly original and non-PC. In my opinion, the writers were obviiously gay since only gay men could come up with such biting dialogue! If the series were premiered today it would stand a far better chance of surviving - UGLY BETTY, which is similar in many ways, is a strong testament to that. Oh well, at least I can enjoy the first season as many times as I like on DVD. That makes me pretty darn happy."
4,ACTION!,"Although the series starring Jay Mohr was short-lived, it was packed with non-stop funny. Illeana Douglas was terrific as a bright, witty call girl-turned production executive. Both Jarrad Paul and Jack Plotnick are perfectly cast in supporting roles as is Lee Arenberg who always excels. As this is a racy, raunchy, sexy take on the movie industry, it is definitely for adults only!"
2,Ok,"I would have liked to have seen the entire series released with the original theme song. I think everyone got cheated because in myopinion this was a quality television show. Having said that, I would still recommend it to everyone."
3,not worth it,"When I bought this dvd I thought it was all the seasons in this one package,but when I got it their were only certain episodes from each season so its not even worth the money to buy this because you can just buy the seasons why have 12 different episodes when you can get the seasons so you can watch them in order."
5,Blades Last Longer,"This set was purchased as a gift, but I always get Bosch blades because they do a great job and last longer than any other blade I've tried. The wood blades don't even have a problem with treated wood. The first metal cutting blade I ""retired"" was after cutting countless metal siding pieces, and finally some angle iron. When it began to slow down, I found that most of the teeth had been worn down. That was a lot of cutting in some difficult material. A few years ago I bought a Bosch jig saw, that came with the blades. When I began using it, I could not believe it kept doing the job for so long, and I've been using jig saws for almost 40 years. The same blade has been used for months at a time. Highly recommend giving Bosch blades a try, as the amount of work they put out is unreal. Don't throw money away on ""bargain"" blades, if they can't finish a project. You will be able to finish many projects with these blades."
5,best blades,After using various brands of saws and blades. I finally purchased a barrel Bosch and a set of the blades as described. I have used the blades a lot and the variety and quality are the best on the market. The saw also is the best I have found. I think this saw will be the last one I will have to purchase. Even the case is of high quality compared to others.
5,"Practical, fun, and informative!","This book is a must-read for anyone who loves cats. He tells fun stories about cats and their owners, which serve to illustrate practical information about feline health and behavior. The book is written in such a way that you do not even realize that you are being given advice. Very easy to read, this book is hard to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever owned, or hoped to own, a cat"
4,Excellent way of getting my 1st grader to love math with coins!!,"Best investment I've made for my little one. She uses it with her belt and she is ready to make change at a moments notice. She is very excited about using it when we get to the check out stand. Highly recommend this item. It has metal components to house the coins but the lever that you push down to get the coins seems like it has a weak spring. Works excellent though. It was only 3.99 for the item so you can't complain. It has taken her math experience to another level, so its value definitely exceeds its cost."
1,Barefoot Beauties playboy,"I was hoping this title was in dvd but had to settle for vhs!I purchased this video strictly for Red Head Heather Carolin.I personally did not get turned on by Heather in this video for one it is too soft core & two she looks different as a 19 year old,I have been into her older stuff which to me is the ultimate red head! 25 & up is her best stuff! So I was dissapointed probably due to too much makeup when she was younger hiding her freckles etc.She is the greatest as a natural red!"
3,Yeah! Now my daughter can tie her shoes,"I don't really like the method they teach in the book, but having the book itself was helpful. The different colored show strings made the explanation much easier. Within a few days of practicing, my daughter could tie her shoes without help."
2,Felt odd tieing using this book.,I ordered this book from Scholastic. I tried showing my 5 year old daughters and it just seemed odd to me. I was hoping for a book that taught my girls how to tie a shoe the way I was taught and it isn't with two bunny ears. It is an awkward way to teach little fingers how to tie. I tried following the directions and couldn't do it myself. Either could my husband or my parents. Maybe it is us!!! I ordered a different book for tieing shoes and it was no longer available so they replaced it with this one.
2,looks cheap with the plastic soles,The soles are molded plastic and look cheap. The shoe fits well. I wonder about the durability of the shoe.
2,"Good creature, bad movie.","I saw this movie at the theater when it was first released. I liked the creature costume then as I do now, but the movie stinks otherwise. What a waste of an excelent creature costume. The film has bad acting, bad sound, stupid story line. Had to have it for the creature though."
1,NC does not work,"The noise cancellation function did not work. When you switch it on you get some hissing sound, but no noise reduction. I did check on low frequency noise; moreover, I picked two headphones in the store (another one was Philips hn 110) and the other one did the job. So, I know how the sound should change when switching on/off. Of course, there is always a chance that it was a defective unit."
2,Philips N/C Earbuds - not good,"I ordered the Philips, tried them when they arrived, and promptly put them back in the package to ship back. They were very disappointing. The sound quality from the original earbuds included with my cheapie MP3 player was better. Very little bass and the treble just sounded scratchy. Try before you buy because there's better equipment out there."
5,Phillips Noise Canceling Earbuds,I can't believe I got this headset for this price! This was exactly what I needed to watch my DVD on the airplane. I didn't even have to use the noise canceling feature. They were perfect. Unbelievable bargain!
3,average,not the best.... the noise cancellation is really not at all effective just acts as an extra mass in between making it very uncomfortable
4,This product was just was i looking for!,"Didn't expect that much but it turns out they work very wellI've used the Bose before, and they are amazing. However, given the price of these, I am more than happy with the quality. It is 1/5 the price of the next best noise canceling in-ear phones. They reduce the noise level quite good, they're ok to play along with your favorite music, well spent money!!"
5,"great on a plane, especially for the price","I bought these to use to watch movies on the plane, and when I first got them, I tried them at home and couldn't figure out what the big deal was about. Basically, if you turn on noise-reduction when there's no noise, there's no benefit.But on the plane, that's a different story. At first, I forgot that I had to turn the noise reduction on, and I was disappointed that even at full volume, I couldn't hear the movie. Then I remembered to switch the noise reduction on, and WOW, what a difference! That's what this headset is made for.Overall, I agree with Aaron J. Thomas' review: they are very comfortable, I like the choice of various ear plug sizes, and the price is right. The noise-reduction switch unit is large, but hey, the things are so inexpensive, it's not a big deal. I can't afford a lot for fancy schmancy noise cancelling earphones, so these suit me just fine."
3,Don't bother if you're next to the engines,"If you're next to the engines on the plane, these won't do a thing for you. The best they'll do is give a little amplified boost to your audio, but there is nothing to be done about the drone of the engines. Cancels out some office noise, though, like keyboard tapping, and was moderately effective during long bus rides with snoring passengers.The control box is heavy and annoying and has no other volume control function besides the active noise cancelling. The earphones are hard-wired to this box, so even if you're just wanting to listen to anything straight without the noise cancelling, you're still tethered to the box. No fun."
1,Absolute junk,"Notice the price? Remember hearing somewhere that ""you get what you pay for?""Well, it was never truer than with these nasty little pieces of Third World junk.The noise cancelling is barely noticeable and the sound quality is nasty and tinny.The Apple earbuds that came with my iPod blow these things out of the water on overall quality and bass response.Save your money for something better. Move along. Nothing to see here."
1,Noise cancellation is worthless.,"The noise cancellation function is worthless. I could detect no noise cancellation whatsoever.Specs claim 10dB attenuation at 300Hz. I tried a tone generator and could detect no attenuation at 300Hz either.The product seems to amplify headphone output a little, but this does nothing to background noise. The amplifier does add noticable hiss too.I'd have given this product a zero if I could have."
1,These sound TERRIBLE,"The sound that comes out of this headset has no bass what so ever, totally tinny. So bad I didn't even try the noise-cancelling ability in a noisy area."
1,Bad buy!!!,"I got these on a previous review about using these certain earphones that are good at noise cancelling while lawn mowing. These do not work at all!!! I tried running with these but they continuously kept falling out, and while laen mowing on a riding lawn mower they did not even remotely lower the noise AT ALL!!! This product was a mistake to buy. You pay what you get I guess Since I had some ""Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK NoiseCancel Earphone"" they cost a good $120 (now $60) and they ACTUALLY worked while lawn mowing. So yes this product may cost less but doesn't work at all. Get the Audio-Techs instead."
1,"Awful, awful headphones","I recently bought these, and they certainly weren't worth the money.Firstly, the ""3 cap sizes to fit your ears"" were very badly thought out - the headphones come with medium sized caps attached, and in the package mould is a single small one and a single large one. There wasnt even a space in the packaging for a second of each. I am not a mutant - I have two ears.Secondly, the ""active noise cancellation"" does not work very well at all. It appears to be only an amplifier (music players have a volume limit built in to stop you damaging your hearing, and this deftly bypasses that,) and even at the most optimum background noise (according to the manual thats a continuous 300hz sound) they have no audible effect except for a quiet, constant background static."
3,Good!,"Its function is normal, cheap!Suitable for low demand customers!Design standards with the same low price, but occasional use is good!"
3,not noise cancelling....,"These buds aren't exactly what are advertised. They don't cancel any extraneous noise at all. Basically, they're more of an amplifier instead since the volume level goes up significantly when the control is activated. But that's all....there's no reduction in outside noise. If you're looking for true noise attenuation, this ain't it. Otherise, they fit well and the volume gain is handy in some ways."
2,Doesn't noise cancel.,"The only thing these headphones do is raise the volume of what your listening too. This gives the illusion that they're noise canceling, but they're really not. I'm not one for real loud music, and they really hurt my ears as soon as I turned on the noise canceling."
3,Noise reduction marginal at best,"These phones do block noise fairly well but it's mostly because the rubber buds seal the ear and not because of the active noise reduction circuitry. I did A/B comparisons using a test tone generator at several frequencies, switching the active reduction on and off. There is some noise reduction at low-mid frequencies but it's quite marginal -- by ear, probably about 3 to (at most) 6 dB. The phones also add a pink-noise ""hiss"" that can be mistaken for noise reduction. These phones are not really bad; just don't expect too much in the way of noise reduction."
2,"Good sound, bad design","These headphones deliver surprisingly good sound for the price, and the noise cancelling works well. (There's the slight hiss when the noise cancelling is active, but this occurs with all noise cancelling headphones to one degree or another.) Long battery life, too.But the cables are way too short. At 6'+, I can't walk with these because the awkward electronics/battery enclosure doesn't quite reach my pockets. And, inexplicably, the weight of the thin earbud cables is enough to drag the earbuds down against your ears, probably aggravated by the weight of the electronics enclosure. An irritating sensation; feels like they're about to fall out.If you plan to sit and listen, or if you're very short, these will work great. Otherwise, the absence of a longer cable and a little clip to keep the cables in place on your shirt make these otherwise good headphones pretty useless."
4,"nice, a little bulky","Nice headphones, good sound. a little bulky though with the inline control box. I've put them in the drawer for ""white noise"" environments (like flying). the noise filter is not useful for what I had hoped, and the battery box makes it bulky to pack in my iSnug case."
1,Noise Cancelling? Noise Creating!,"I found the cancelling to be minimal, while the high-frequency hiss and 60Hz buzz (from the unsheilded wiring?) to be worse than nothing.Mine's going back. Lao Tzu said the biggest problem could solved easily, when it was small. Solve this problem by looking elsewhere."
3,Great quality but lacking in the design department,"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love phillips products. They last a fairly long time and their overall appearance is attractive. While I do like the look of these buds, their design is flawed. I have had many noise canceling headphones but none as awkward as these. I use these at the gym and I like to put my iPod and the noise canceling unit in my pocket. With these headphones I can't, the noise canceling unit is too high up on the cord which forces you to either hold it, find a creative way to tie it to your shorts or just let it hang. The headphones are beautiful but they are inconvenient to work with in a gym setting."
1,"Noise ADDITION, and poor sound reproduction","The only noise reduction obtained with the headphones was the passive reduction from having the buds firmly placed in the ear. With the noise reduction turned on background sounds didn't change one bit, but the earbuds added a hissing sound. If I use them while listening to music, turning on the ""sound reduction"" adds the hissing noise, and increases the music volume. The only affect that they seem to have on background sounds is not to reduce them, but to try and drown them out. To make it worse, the sound reproduction of these earbuds is horrible. The sound is very tinny, far worse than that from the cheap earbuds that came with my iPod."
2,So So,"The earbuds construction are good but the battery module is in the wrong place because is to heavy to carried in. When you turn in the noise cancelling it make a ""shhhhhh"" noise and I really think don't cancell any external sound. I have to useit like normal earbuds because this sound.I don't recomend this product."
1,Poor Design,"""The design of this item is poor the battery pack dangle with no way to clip on a belt or anything. I ride the train and the design is terrible. The sound is good, but the design is so bad I'm getting a different pair. Waste of my money. Think about how you are really going to use the ear buds, not portably friendly."
1,little to no noise cancelling and picks up interference,"Connected to an iPhone in noisy city environments (trains, streets, etc), the noise canceling was completely ineffective. (I haven't yet tried it with the steady background hum you'd find on an airplane.) It also picks up interference from my cellphone, making it wildly annoying even as straight noise-isolating earbuds. And as other people have noted, the heavy and poorly placed mid-line control makes it impractical to wear these things unless you place the control into a shirt pocket or are under 5 feet tall and can place it into a pants pocket."
2,Not for puppys,I bought this for our German Shorthair who is 3 months old. She is a busy chewer. This came off in pieces and made a huge mess. I also think the pieces that she ingested gave her the poops. It would be a good toy for an older dog who likes to carry stuff around and play tug-o-war but not chew for hours on a toy.
2,was not tough enough for my dog,"I have an 11 month old springer spaniel. I had purchased the double ring and originally thought that I had finally found a tug of war toy that would outlast my puppy. My puppy finally chewed completly through one of the loops. So much for the invinsibility, but it did last a few months and while it lasted he absolutely loved it."
1,a book to skip,"This is a book to avoid--a hiking book without a single map! If you can find your own maps, or use a Florida state map, then there is good information in the hike descriptions."
1,Poor Choice,"I received this as a gift after putting it on my wish list. The first time I wore it, the clasp would not stay closed and the bracelet kept popping off despite the fact that it fit loosely on my wrist. The second time I wore it, the same thing kept happening, and luckily someone found the bracelet and asked if it was mine. I used pliers to bend the clasp so that it would stay closed. At the end of the day, I looked down and saw that the agate ""stone"" was GONE! Nice silver, but a poorly made bracelet. Do not recommend."
3,Failed after 11 months of light use,"We are weekend coffee drinkers but love a good cup of coffee, with fresh locally roasted beans etc. The maker was excellent but like the reviews said when we bought it, they don't last long. The price enticed me to buy it, though. Now we will see how well DeLonghi processes warranty claims, the first contact with them went smoothly."
5,"I like it, I really like it...","I am on my third machine. The first one quit after the first brewing. I have to say that DeLonghi Customer service was wonderful, they sent me a replacement fairly soon after. That one died a few months later (for an unknown reason, just stopped working). But while it worked it was a fabulous machine, makes great coffee. After the second one died, I purchased a replacement since Amazon had such a great price, and to date is still working (fingers-crossed!). I love the look of this machine and will continue to buy them as long as the price is right."
1,DID ANYONE NOTICE.....,"i dont get it but these kids ignore talent and don't realize that their favorite stars are all hasbeens, which is why there on disney only! she blows and since her career is over, i think amazon should take her off their website!"
1,bye JOJO,"GROW UP! SHE IS AN UNTALENTED 1-HIT-WONDER HASBEEN AND HER VOICE IS JUST DECENT, NOT EXTRAORDINARY! SHE IS SO GONE AND UNTALENTED. SHE ONLY SINGS AND WROTE 1 FULL SONG AND CO-WROTE 2. WOW THE TALENT ENDS THEIR AND SHE IS GONE AND DUMB...BY JOJO THE MOMO!"
4,Everest The Summit,Have you ever climb Mt Everest? In this book Everest there are four kids who are trying to get the championship of the world to be the youngest person to climb Mt.Everest.In the story there are four kids who wnt to be the youngest person ever to climb Mt. Everest. But each time they go higher the supplies get lower. Conditions are extreme. and one of them to be mean to the other three. The challenge is getting to hard and they are not prepared for the storm that is coming.A good quality is that if you ever want to climb Mt. Everest first read this book. The best part of the book is when they fall in a secret cave under the snow. this is one good quality I think.I want to recomened this book to my mom because she likes adventure books. I would also recomend this book to all the people who like adventure books. I hope you guys and girls enjoy this book as i enjoyed it.
4,Be careful with this stuff,"Bought the glue to attach mosaic glass tile pieces to bathroom wall in a direct application. The pieces were small, 1/4 to 1/2 inch, and the glue ended up on my fingers and then on the face of the glass, when it was willing to adhere to the vertical surface. The grout stuck to the glue and I had to use dental tools and a special cleaner to get it off the glass. I am sure the adhesive is good, dries clear, but although tile sources recommended it I would not use it again for my kind of project."
5,Just what I wanted,Wanted some great sounding waterproof speakers for out by the pool. Have a nice set of cheaper Jensons on the patio but I didn't order those because they are not rated for full exposure so I found these and for a few more dollars they are fantastic! Great full ranging sound and loud enough on my old JVC reciever and amp even when we're splashing around.
1,Crashes on ipad 2,"La Sainte Bible crashes on Ipad 2, which I understand is common for this book on Ipad 2. I got no reply from Amazon when I inquired about it."
3,Le meilleur: le DVJ. Le pire: elle cache le nom de Dieu,"Je trouve qu'elle est une traduction plus ou moins correcte, sauf par le fait qu'elle suit la tradiction de remplacer le nom Dieu (Jéhovah ou Yaveh) par ""L'Éternel"". Néanmoins, je l'ai achettée parce que l'access direct aux versets (DVJ) est très practic."
3,Decent,"The text is very small and the pages are so thin that it often shows through on the other side making it difficult to read. But, because the price is so low it is still an okay deal."
1,"If you need it for Halloween it's ok, otherwise don't bother.",I bought this for my Halloween Costume and that's about it's actual quality. You can't hear a heartbeat worth squat on it so don't bother purchasing it unless you don't plan on using it for anything but show.
5,For any sports fan!,"I admit, as a transplanted Chicagoan and die-hard sports fan, its hard to be objective about this book. Scott Simon cleverly weaves his own personal remembrances of growing up in Chicago, into an historic timeline of sports and politics, which amounts to must read for anyone who wants a true glimpse into the soul of 'the city with big shoulders'.I laughed hard and often at the family anecdotes, its easy to see where Simon gets his sense of humor, thrilled at reliving the Cub season of '69 and saddened, once again, at Brian Piccolo's courageous battle with cancer.After finishing 'Home and Away', I was compelled to send copies to a few of my sports buddies...less fortunate souls having grown up in cities of less character.I am a fan of the city, its teams (except the Sox...go Cubbies), and this writer ,who embodies it all so well in this book.Bravo."
4,work well but drains battery i have lots of varmint but work well,I also made a steel cage out of 5/32 welding wire and welded together with small angle iron with hole in the center welded it in four point to mount it on the bottom of a 55 gallon barrel work better and the zapper now the battery last about 6 weeks but the battery is brand new after a few charges that will change to
1,Disappointed,"I wish I never bought this product. I was excited to receive and when I opened and read instructions it said to put on a mask and that it could irritate my pet's paws. I wanted to have a memory of my kitty to last for years, but am ready to put this in the trash. Very unhappy and wish instructions were not so difficult and toxic."
1,All three canisters cracked,All three canisters cracked within 4-9 months. Now begins the task of trying to get Amazon to give me a partial credit?
1,Terrible,The mic on this headset was terrible and within 2 weeks the earpiece fell off without so much as taking them off my head. DO NOT BUY these. They are terrible.
3,Might Buy again,Im not really sure about this product it was helpful for everything i needed but the ear muffs were pretty small and they broke after about 1 month and my price 8 dollars so i expected worse but didn't get that much better than i thought. So overall great product WORTH BUYING IF YOU WANT SOMETHING CHEAP THAT WILL LAST FOR ABOUT MONTH.
4,A very good story,I've read this and A Cold Day in Paradise.Alex Mcknight is a likeable character and the story and setting is interesting.
4,Like earclip headphones,I am unable to use ear buds and most head phones due to a burst ear drum while a child.Most stores have quit carrying the ear clip head phones so I was delighted to find them on Amazon.
3,Not for larger ears,These fit comftorably on my ears but ride above the earhole therfore losing alot of the sound. They also do not fold in because of the fit. If they are placed over the earhole then they sound very good. I gave them to my daughters who have small ears and they are happy with them.
2,Good earphones until you randomly lose sound in one ear,"I like these earphones - the sound is good, the size isn't too large, and they are comfortable. I specifically buy non-earbud headphones as my ear canals are so small that earbuds will not stay put and so when I found these I thought they were great. However, within just a few months, the sound in the right ear went out. I thought at first it was me being too rough on them, but within a month (exactly a month!) of purchasing a second pair, the sound in the left ear has gone out. The cord must be too delicate, so if you are running with them, carry them around in a purse/gym bag, etc these headphones may not be your best choice. Onto the next set of clip-ons for me! Wish me luck."
3,Disappointed,The candle burns well and even. I do not enjoy the scent. It remind me of citronella or lemon pledge . Would buy candle again in a different scent
2,"Disappointing, bad scent, burns dirty","I ordered this thinking I would really love it, since I really like the Mrs Meyer's lemon verbana handsoap. Unfortunately, this smells more like a cloyingly sweet vanilla scent with a tinge of citrus, instead of a refreshing, uplifting lemon verbena.Also, the candle did not burn cleanly, leaving black soot in the glass. I keep the wick trimmed, but the candle does not burn evenly, and I ended up having to throw it away even though there was still a lot of wax in it.I now purchase a Lemon Verbena Soy Candle (no brand indicated) from Target, and it is a MUCH better scent and burns very cleanly.I do not recommend this Mrs Meyers candle at all."
1,Awful,"I love lavender and was excited to get this candle, which sounded great. But it was awful! Perhaps the candle had gone bad, but it had a terrible smell like old beer. I didn't even return it as I couldn't stand having it my house (I have a small condo) and it was making my place stinky even unlit."
2,Compilation of SCM Concepts and match them to SAP APO,"This book is way too expensive for its content value. I found this book to be just mostly a compilation of Supply Chain Management concepts from work of others including materials from SAP. I feel the author was trying to map at very high level of those SCM concepts to SAP APO capability. If you do not know anything much about SCM and APO, this book is probably good for you to give you ideas of how SAP APO can be used. But again, you can get that from SAP website. Do not expect to get any detailed features of DP, SNP, and PP/DS out of this book, they are just not there. I found it hard to believe someone can rate this book as 5 stars"
2,Good Earphones but don't cancel anything!!!,"These behind the head earphones are good for listening to music, with good sound quality for the price, but do not stand up to the description as a noise canceling product. Overall do to the poor description, I wouldn't recommend."
1,Took them straight back,"Bought them today, tried them once and took them straight back. Extremely uncomfortable, can't perceive any noise blocking and they distort on high volume bass. Complete waste of money - back to Sony!!"
2,Disappointing,"Would have been a nice item - comfortable and noise cancellation is pretty good BUT:- this item requires a AAA battery (did you understand that from the product info? I didn't!) and the only way to ""turn off"" the battery and keep it from draining is to open a little plastic door and pop the battery out. NOT convenient.- after 7 months, one side no longer works. I'm throwing it out. Never again do I buy a headset that doesn't state a one-year warranty."
4,A Great Deal for the Price,"I just recieved these last week and i have had a couple days to use them and i have to say for 22.00 they are GREAT, the noise reduction isn't as prominent as some other noise cancelling headphones i have heard, (bose and sennheisers) but at 1/3-1/10 the cost of anything else out there, these are great.. and they are pretty comfortable too. The only thing i wish they could do was make the additional part that holds the battery and the switch for the noise cancelling, much smaller.. but oh well for 22.00 I love them.."
2,Not worth it,"I got this pair for only like $25 bucks but I still feel ripped off. I take really good care of my gadgets and electronics, but this somehow still got damaged. I bought this pair as my ""nice"" pair of headphones, only using them on special occasions because they're not as compact, but even with minimal usage, it still crapped out.Pros:- stylishcons:- one of the cushion head pieces came off and its IMPOSSIBLE to put back on.- the noise cancellation on amplifies the sound a bit but is not effective.- the noise cancellation remote/on/off thing is bulky and inconvenient- lastly, even though I barely use these and don't don't turn it up very high because I don't enjoy loud/blaring music, one of the speakers barely works...I sound like a bitter old lady..haha but yes..overall I didn't enjoy these at allll...."
1,Will the buzzing stop???,"I bought these today so that I could review an mp3 presentation. As soon as I put the headphone on I wanted to take them back! It has the most annoying buzzing sound. What Philips means what they say ""Noise Canceling"" is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise!Well I'm taking these back!"
1,Don't bother,"I picked these up thinking the noise reduction feature would be nice for use on a plane. As soon as I took them out of the box and turned them on it was clear I had wasted my money. These headphones sound ok for music playback, but the noise reduction is barely perceptible. I'm returning them tomorrow.If you're looking for good music playback, you can find better phones for less. If you're looking for noise reduction, look elsewhere."
2,noise cancellation,"i purchased at a yard sale, the IT. brand noise cancelling headphones, unfortunately, a co-worker snapped the headbad part, but i managed 2 rig them n a way that i can still wear them. i decided 2 go online & c what other varieties were available. i purchased these (Philips shn5500/37 Noise Cancelling Headphones) because they go around the head, which, because i work at a golf course, i need something 2 drown out the sound of the mowers i operate. these dissapointed me greatly. wasted my money. but what can i do? i own them now."
2,Pill too large!,"I can't comment on the effectiveness of this vitamin, because I have not taken it enough to know. The reason that I rarely take it is because the pills are so large and there are so many to take. I absolutely dread taking these. When I do, I can barely get the pills down my throat and taste them as I do. Yuck! There is no way that I could have stomached these while I was pregnant (I am taking a prenatal now for nursing). I far prefer the New Chapter Perfect Prenatals. They are much smaller and easier to swallow."
5,Difference from one a day,"I took the rainbow light one a day with my first child and had no problems. My daughter is very smart and healthy.With baby #2 I wanted to be a little bit more involved with my vitamin routine because I am over 35. I started the complete system one month prior to conceiving and have continued, I am now in my 20th week.I have read reviews from people about the size or the pills, the 6 pills a day and the price. I can see how all of those things are cumbersome, however, I have had zero morning sickness, I have had good energy and to me, putting a price on the health and start of my child is a non issue. I felt these were the best vitamins and I would of paid double.I sincerely feel they made a difference in the first trimester and I will continue to take them, regardless if I have to take 6 a day, pay extra, and gag them down."
4,Great Prenatal Vitamin,"I've been taking these prenatal vitamins since before I was pregnant (I'm about 6 months along now). There was a good 2.5 months where I wasn't able to take the recommended dosage because of extreme nausea I was experiencing, but it was not fault of the vitamins themselves... I just wasn't able to hold much more than crackers down at the time. It is a drag though that you need to take 6 of these a day. Since I tend to forget, I just take 3 with breakfast and 3 with dinner as opposed to separating the dosage out more. I wouldn't consider these pills terribly large, but I don't tend to have a problem with taking any pills.I've seen a lot of benefits with taking these vitamins so far, such as my hair and nails growing in much faster and helping with my digestion. I've tried a few other brands in the past, trying to find something more affordable, but I think this is worth the extra money."
2,Not what I expected,"I am not going to buy this product again. I personally need to try something else. Everyone seemed to love this product, but these pills gave me so much gas it was painful. I also cannot say that it helped my nausea.A lot of people seem to like these pills, but I just want people to know that they are far from perfect if you react to them like I have."
5,Whole food Vitimins,"I've been using these for a while, I have 9 children. I've taken them while both pregnant and nursing. I feel great while taking them. I have PCOS and need extra amounts of certain vitamins and these come closes to my needs without having to take a lot of additional pills."
5,all around great shirt,"This shirt is very thick and heavy-duty. It is kinda stretchy, and didn't shrink when I put it in the dryer. What can I say, so far everything that I've bought from Mountain Hardwear has exceeded my expectations."
5,I am so glad you all loved the movie from Coco Jones!,"I know this is not your topical review, but I just wanted to say thank you for all of the kind comments about our movie. I really enjoyed participating in the movie and I am so proud of the finished product. I was raised by my parents to be very respectful and to understand the impression that my performance will have on young people like myself, and I know this movie does just that. It has some great messages throughout, and one of the most important ones is the message from my character Roxxie. All girls have problems wanting to fit in, but Roxxie's character shows girls and really everyone, that you do not have to try to fit in, by wearing crazy clothes, for crazy makeup, just be yourself and things will work out just fine. I believe in this message and that's how I live my life. I know you will enjoy the move, I had a blast making it!! Please continue to follow my projects, this is only the beginning, TheRealCocoJones.com Thank you, Coco :D"
4,Christmas Gift,This was a requested gift for a 10-year old girl. She was pleased with the gift and viewed the video on Christmas Day.
2,XPW's first king of the death match tourney,"I have only seen this tape, bap in blood 2, and ... in regards to xpw. All of them have been ok, but nothing special. A lot of XPW cards seem good on paper but do not translate well into shows, and this is no different. Axl Rotten, John Kronus, and Chris Candido all look awful in this video even though they are big names in wrestling (come on guys, take pride in your work!). The stars of the video are Supreme (who takes vicious punishment), Messiah (who wrestles a terrific match with Supreme), and Kid Kaos (who, even though it is a death match tourney, still impresses with his insane high flying moves). Every match that is not part of the actual tourney is, to be put nicely, aweful. This tape gets 2 stars as it has 3 decent matches."
5,Great soap,"If it's possible for a bar of soap to be beautiful, this one fits. Color is deep and rich, as is the lather. Scent is as described. Loving the way it looks and the way it feels."
5,pedals,These pedals work great! Improved my workout many times over. Way better than factory pedals. Highly recommended.
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I read many of the books my children select so that we can discuss them. Many are disappointing but the Wreck of the Ethie was thoroughly enjoyable. Hilary Hyland has written a story that you can't put down. Her descriptions of the characters, events and Newfoundland dog are so well done that you feel you are on the shore watching the entire rescue take place. My 9 year old daughter read the book in one sitting and talked about it for days after. Ms. Hyland should be commended for her obviously painstaking research into the story. This kind of wholesome story depicting the good in humanity is what our children should be reading."
5,Wonderfully written and deeply moving! I cried.,"This is such a beautiful, moving story. I broke out crying while reading it at my beauty salon, and the staff was concerned about me. I reassured them that I was just reading a terrific book! Don't miss this and share it with your kids."
4,"Oh No, It's DEVO!","It's Devo. Live. Recent. (Within last 5 or 6 years I believe) Not as good as their Devo Live 1980 DVD, but its still a lot of fun."
5,"A lovely, lively, dyamic tale","Janice Holt Giles carefully researched plains life in the early 1800's before writing this splendid work about a wagon train venturing into a new route from St. Louis to Santa Fe. Her main characters, newly married Folwlers, are surrounded by rough, quaint, hard, sensitive men, plus one escaped slave, as they venture into unknown lands. Skirmishes with Indians, kidnappings, dust storms, stampeeds, all liven the tale.It is a good reminder, too, that the west was not only tamed by the sombrero--the sunbonnet had its triumphs as well.An excellent read for anyone who appreciates the research of the historian and the art of a good tale well told."
3,A Bit Bland for my Taste,"This books starts okay, Valeria hears the call, defies her mother and leaves to pursue what she knows is her destiny. About a third of the way into the story, somethings loses its spark and the plot seems to meander.There seems to be no reason why she ""likes"" Euan at first, other than the fact that he's *there. (If that's the selection system everyone used, my god...) Afterwards, she jumps from man to man, using her body somewhat like a tool, which gives a bad message to young female readers. If men can get what they want by bravery and cleverness, why can't female characters?The story isn't bad, but it leaves a little to be desired. After a while, I was just forcing myself to finish. Although it isn't a grab-you-from-the-first-page-and-never-let-go sort of book, it still makes you want to know what happens to the characters at the end.I'm not sure if I will be reading the sequel."
2,A Stinker,"I really thought I would like this book, I really did! It started off so well, very Harry Potter like with the herioine headed off to this mystical school where she was to learn about the White Horse Gods...but as it went on and on and on...it lost its thrill.I can't really say why. The plot though intending to become more intense, only became more and more dull. The whole plot is culminating in this ""Dance"" and though it is obviously important to the story, the author fails to explain WHY this ""dance"" is so important. I guess it can change the course of stuff...but who really cares?Mostly, this book is made up of lots of sex and torture, two things that in my opinion are not really related, so all and all this book was a stinker.two stars."
1,How did this even get published?,"Ok, if you live in NYC and always go to Lake Placid on holiday then this is the guide for you. If you want a guide to NY state then forget it- it really does only cover the south east and the north east, about 25% of the state.Since central NY is so chock full of trails it has not occured to me to get a guide, I just get on my bike and explore. I was given this book for christmas and looked with interest to see if there were any trails within a couple of hours drive that I might try for a weekend change of scene. This book contains nothing of interest to those who live outside NYC."
1,Expensive mistake,"My boss had invited me over to watch a game on Sunday and asked that I bring a bottle of jack.Not being aware of the subtle difference between a bottle jack and a bottle of jack, I made an expensive mistake.In my opinion, this product should have a better name. And my boss should not have an accent.I am now planning to use this 20 ton hydraulic bottle jack to crack brazil nuts. Fun fact: Brazil nuts are actually from Bolivia."
1,Sorry Pants..,"Ordered 9/19/11 received 10/4/11, No where in the write up did it state that it could come from Canada, the pants are tissue paper thin and are not acceptable for a man, much less someone who in handicapped. I am very upset that such a product would be offered, and the price is way too high for the product offered. I will sure rethink ordering from this company. what a rip off. Hope I don't have outrageous postage to return this item."
5,Fellowes shredder,"Very pleased with this shredder. I had another brand, and it only lasted a few months. This one works very well, and is actually fairly quiet, with a large capacity for shredded paper."
1,Disappointed,"Received this item December 2010 now September 2011 and no longer works. Very disappointed in this product. Spent too much on this to be disposable...spent the extra to have a product that lasts, and in hind sight, should have gone with a cheaper model and planned to replace every year. This shredder did not even make it a year. You can do better Fellowes."
1,"Unless you want crushed marble, don't order this item. It arrived broken!","I don't know how this item is as a rolling pin. I only know that it arrived poorly packaged, in a box too big for it, with barely any padding (just some crumpled paper) and it was cracked in half with marble ""sand"" in the package. It is only a 10"" barrel as others have mentioned. Although Amazon makes the return relatively easy, it's still a hassle to deal with it and I still don't have a marble rolling pin. I won't be ordering another one of these for fear that I will run into the same problem."
5,very clear,"This cleaned up my tank very quickly. My fish always panic a little bit when I add stuff to the water, but they didn't seem to be affected by this."
4,Cute little book,"I bought this book for my 10 y.o. daughter and one for my 8 y.o. niece. Not as much info as they would have liked, but awesome pictures, simple explanations. A very cute little book and a good companion to Nintendogs."
3,Mild,This would be a great Anime for children. But I am not a child. The delivery time and the price was great. It was a good purchase experience. But I do not like the content.
1,Does Not Match My Ginkgo Patriot Pattern!,I received this set and much to my dismay it did not match the Ginkgo Patriot Pattern that I already own. The size and weight were different and the butterknives were totally different. I LOVE my Ginkgo flatware and was adding additional placesettings.
2,AutoCAD 2005 for Dummies,"This represents a book for the very beginner to the AutoCAD 2005 program. Assuming zero knowledge, you can at least draw lines and dimension simple projects after reading the book. After reading, I needed to purchase an AutoCAD Bible to progress to a more useful stage. I then passed the book on to another beginner student.I would recommend buying the more detailed book initially."
1,AutoCad 2005 For Dummies,"I personally did not like this book. It has been years, maybe 5, to be exact, since I worked in AutoCad. So I was hoping that I could get this book as a refresher course. NOT!I was looking for something that served as a quick reference, but it did not. There were not many details about what I was looking for. This book just did not work for me.I have puchased the AutoCad Bible, I will let you know how this one is......"
5,Worth the list price,"The Vic Firth pepper mill is easily worth the list price, at least among the higher price options I looked at. The wood and wookworking are excellent. I chose the basic maple because I generally keep a pepper mill among my knife block and other unfinished maple kitchenware. I'm just as happy with it in the dining room.The mechanism works as described, crushing, then grinding to a wide and more precise than I had expected range of grain sizes. I've changed the grain size, refilled, and regularly used a single setting. It has been very consistent in maintaining a setting I like and is as fast as the other pricey models I've used.It comes with a lifetime guarantee and was priced well lower than retail. I expect that over time it will be a good value, provided that it doesn't get snatched up by another pepper lover."
1,Take the reviews advice,"I bought this book despite it's bad reviews and I must say that I am sorry I did. This book is very poorly written. I got only to chapter 3 and the examples have led me to debug to get them to work. Example, chapter 3 asks you to connect to an Access database (OleDB) with a SQL Object! No, no. It also in the same chapter references a view in the PROVIDED Access database off the disk named OrderTotals thats not even there!I would have given this 0 stars, but it was not an option."
1,Lot of C# errors,"Currently on chapter 9 of this book. Don't know about the VB, but there are a lot of C# errors. Maintaining a running list on my web site: http://www.waynekeller.com/ADO_errors.htm"
1,Underwhelming junk,"Poorly designed and poorly built. A cheap, too small plastic ""x"" with four unsightly sticks protruding from its ends to supposedly hold the computer in place. You can't lock the ""x"" to hold the computer in place. At the end the comouter ends up literally hanging from this undersized contraption. Any attempt to move it (the wheels are a joke) will just open the ""x"" and make the computer fall. A useless piece of junk."
4,Just what I needed,"I have been needing a stand for my gaming computer for a while, and this is just what I needed."
2,"Durable, but very uncomfortable","My pair never self destructed or had any quality issues, but they had a huge comfort issue. These are very sturdy and durable and were definitely designed to be used hard, the problem with that was that they were very low on the ankle and gave no support to it. These were strong enough to be hiking shoes, but didn't have the support to go with it. There used to be a low boot version of this shoe that would make more sense - don't know if it still available or not.On the comfort scale, they were very bad. I wore them for months to loosen them up...it didn't help. They never got loose and they never got comfortable. The fact is they were one of the least comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned.I like Ecco shoes, but do not recommend this style."
5,Bruculinu/Brooklyn,Great story about growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950's. Even more interesting to my husband who grew up on the next block.
5,heartwarming and hilarious,"Mr> Schiavelli, Thank you so much for this wonderful book. It brought me back to my childhood and the many happy memories spent around Nonna and Nonnu's dining room table. I absolutely loved this book. Thanks again for the laughter and the love. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it aloud to my husband and children."
5,Very Solid Sharpeners,"DMT always makes a good quality product, and they are all made in the USA! Not many companies can say that about their products now a days. I would recommend these sharpeners.Also something to note: these sharpeners DO NOT have any flex to them... I figured that they might be kind of flexible considering they are only the thickness of a standard credit card, but they are as solid as a rock! There is no bending them!"
5,Life Changing,"This film is nothing short of amazing. After seeing it, I had my daughter watch it with me and she was as moved as I was. It details the progression of alcoholism with astonishing compassion as seen through the eyes of a (very human) cop. I read an earlier review by an addiction counselor who said he would never show it again because it does not show the recovery portion of alcoholism. The subject of this film, Mark, has not made it into recovery and it is not likely that he ever will. Those who have been lucky enough to find their way out of this insidious addiction will be inspired to continue on their path of healing after watching this film. Two thumbs up Mr. Sperling, you did a beautiful job!"
2,Perfect Coffee Maker - Not Yet,"Although well built, the single-hole diaphragm does not make crema as well as my other espresso makers. The espresso does not come out evenly, so one cup fills twice as fast as the other.It apears that the coffee pod adapter on the bottom of the boiler interferes with the proper tamping of the coffee grounds, so it's hard to get a good seal. I really cinch the filter holder to avoid leaks. You might have better luck with the coffee bod holder.Finally, the measure has a really short handle, so you will have to do a bit of digging to get the grounds out of the can or jar.On the plus side the machine heats up quickly and and is ready to make coffee in just a few minutes, and has lots of steam to froth milk very well.Unless you use the coffee pod system, I suggest that you stay away from the dual pod/ground coffee machines."
5,Great Value,"Great value. Great coffee. Works now for every day use for more than 100 coffees. (I know since I use pods). It's a bit noisier than I would have expected, but my friend says pumps all make noise. It's quick to warm up and easy to clean. I'm a bit troubled by the amount of force it takes to put the filter on with pods, but I'm used to it now. Excellent crema, even with not the fanciest coffee pods....I wrote the above review about a year ago and, well, I got a year out of it. Worth it though. I'm pretty abusive to appliances (left it on too long, ran pump dry many times, used it more frequently than intended for home use). Therefore, my vote remains 5 stars"
4,"A great, inexpensive espresso machine","This is my fourth espresso machine, my third with a pump. My last machine was a Gaggia Expresso, and this machine is better. It heats up very fast. Great crema every time. I love the ability to set the amount of espresso dispensed. The steamer is so powerful, I have to be careful. And the machine is relatively easy to clean. At first I thought it was a little flimsy, compared to the Gaggia, which was a chunk; however, I like the small size, because it fits under the cabinet."
3,Espresso Quality Goes Down the Tubes,"We have had the machine for a year after a Briel Lido had served us well for 3 years.But the Chamonix frothing wand began to leak 6 months ago. I just put a cup under it but then I wondered, if the name of the game is pressure...? I watched the frothing wand leak ""at rest"" and when making espresso. Voila! The leak became much more intense in the latter state.Cleaning (de-scaling) the machine seems to help but just for a day or two.Then I recommended the Chamonix to a friend. She made me an expresso out of her new machine. It was wonderful! Intense and tasty. I realized my machine was turning out something like gas station coffee and I had talked myself into thinking I was still getting true espresso.Now the pressure is on me to stop the leak (I have done the New Jersey Mambo once ... and never will again). But when I plug the wand, water sprays from its base. Nope. I won't be getting my full pressure or my good espresso back anytime soon.Shopping again."
3,Basic clipper with good attachments,"This kit affirms the adage that you get what you pay for. Does an acceptable job. Neither high style nor built to last, this clipper kit gets the job done. Treat with care, though, as it is a bit fragile. May not be as effective on tough or wiry hair. Its ""Haircutting For Dummies"" booklet is helpful. Good way to learn the principles of haircutting! Requires patience."
1,you get what you pay for,"The large electrical clippers wouldn't cut butter and the smaller battery clippers work fine, but eat batteries. I threw these away. Wasn't worth my time to send back."
3,Not bad,"I just got this from amazon, the trimmer is not bad. the small one that comes with it that runs on a AA batteries, is awesome. WORKS great. the main trimmer is kind of annoying to use, you would have to adjust the power flow, until you get it right, after that it works like a charm. The finishing is really cheap on it, but what can you expect for the price. It does come with a 5 year manf warranty"
4,Really effective multi drills in a nice pack,"When I order it, I don't think it will greatly affect on my desire to repair in my home. After I received it, it was useful tools for drill and you can change multi kind of bits for your drill. I recommend to own it. The price is suitable and shipping is the right time."
4,Not the Same Product,"I owned the original product (the one pictured in the product listing with 2 instead of 3 groups of bits) for years. These bits were wonderful and well made. They resulted in clean and easy to drill holes. Unfortunately, I lost this set during a house move. I was prepared to receive a different sent of bits that might not be as well made thanks to other customer reviews. These bits will probably work fine my most folks but I do want to emphasize these bits will probably work fine for me but the quality of the bits is certainly not up to the original set (which can be purchased on Ebay for about $38). The edges and metal show flaws which I didn't find in the original set.If I could have compared this cheaper set with the more expensive original set, I would have gone with the original set. Note, I haven't use the bits yet and will follow up this review after I give them a whirl."
4,THA SICKNEZZ,"I remember bumpin this one back in the day,this one put X & LYNCH on tha map.This one can't be duplicated,it's a classic no doubt.Pick it up!!!"
4,Psycho Active ill ...,"this cd is one of raideds hardest cds its not that strong on recording, cause it isn't main stream and not that much money was put into it. but this is when raided resembled lynch in a way by his sickness in his spits, dont get me wrong raided made lynch. but his newer stuff isn't as sick, it is spit way harder and way more verbal, its almost like east coast rhymes but he keeps it gangsta. I recommend buying this if you really feel raided is one of the best rappers out there then you'll see how he stays real and how he changed over a few years."
2,Word to the Wise,"After putting myself through college by working at an espresso bar, I developed a bit of a latte habit. Ten years and many income levels later, I decided it was time to purchase a semi-professional machine for home. Sadly, the Briel worked beautifully for only a few months. Now it cannot heat water to anything above lukewarm, much less make a steaming cup of espresso or froth milk. And the service center is as completely unhelpful as reported by other users. Anyone need a rather large hunk of metal sculpture? It looks a lot like an espresso machine...."
2,Misleading product description,"We ordered this item recently and wound up returning it. We liked the fact that it included a ""10 cup drip coffeemaker"" as part of the package so we wouldn't have two separate coffee appliances on the counter. In reality the 10 cups amount to about 6 cups by normal U.S. standards. The carafe, when filled to its stated 10 cup limit, held about 36 ounces of water or about 3.6 ounces per ""cup"" of coffee. If you need a regular full size coffee maker for daily use and are considering this product to kill two birds with one stone, please be aware that you won't be getting one as part of the package. It seems that the ""espresso only"" version of this machine makes more sense."
1,This Machine Does Not Work,I bought one of these machines and had to send it back to the factory 3 times. It still does not work. Beware
3,A decent enough entry,"A good enough game when one looks at its predecessors; however, the controls and concepts have been dumbed down almost to the point of being meaningless; in the previous three entries, the proper management of power really meant something, ECM/ECCM could make or break an engagement, shuttles (and fighters) could be dedicated to more specific tasks, and the shield arcs were more logical; here, everything is a bit too much on the ""point-and-shoot"" side, with way too many of the concepts of SFB abandonned in favor of simplistic gameplay. While it is nice to see a modicum of the old games principles applied to the TNG/DS9/Voyager universe, I reaally wish that the developers would have brought more of the SFB gameplay principles into the 24th century."
2,OK,"The book tells you about memorial services, embalming, picking out caskets etc. When we bought the book it was to help tell us what things ie. legal matters needed to be attended to. Maybe it just wasn't the right book for what we needed. All the burial stuff was over when we bought the book."
4,Nice one!,"This is an invaluble resource for anyone looking for information relating to the Scottish Clans. It includes colour pictures of coats of arms and tartans for each as well as information relating to their history and origins. The book is also liberally illustrated with excellent colour photographs of places of significance to the names under consideration. The introuction includes first rate information regarding coats of arms in Scotland, tartans, the Clan system, Scottish royalty and so on. Slightly dissappointing is the brevity of the histories for some of the Clans, for example Macrae only merits seventy words."
3,way too long,Way too long; precious little adventure. He should have stuck to Asimov's pattern or been more creative like Burgauer.
1,Not as tough as we hoped!,"I will continue my search for a truly tough dog toy. My young (petite) labrador chewed off a chunk of this in 5 minutes! She loves the toy, but I had to take it away....."
2,"Great concept, but not tough enough","This toy really intrigued my ADD beagle, but it only lasted a few days. Beagle boy was able to chew his way through it. If it were made with a sturdier rubber like the extreme Kong toy, I might buy another. At this point, however, too much money to spend for my power chewer to destroy."
5,Great Toy,"My one and a half year old dog destroys lots of toys. The Hol-ee Mol-ee Extreme hold up well. She bangs it on the floor, chews it and catches it in mid-air. And that's without food inside! Sometimes we'll put ""Pup-Corn"" inside and it will keep her occupied for a while trying to get the treats out. She'll roll it with her nose and wait for the Pup-Corn to fall out or she'll hold the toy with her paws and try to get the treats out with her tongue. The Hol-ee Mol-ee Exteme is by far her most favorite toy."
5,Awesome,Our puppy loves this brand and so do we they last price well good quality ....colors fun and bright can clean in dishwasher
4,"JW Pet Company Hol-ee Roller X Extreme 5 Dog Toy, 5-Inches","We have a Golden Retriever and a Chocolate Labrador who both Love this toy. It is perfect for throwing to the dogs outdoors. It is a little large so it took a few tries for the dogs to figure out how to pick it up with their mouths, but once they figured it out, they loved this toy. I would recommend this product for large dogs as long as they enjoy retrieving."
3,Gave it away,I gave it to another dog owner because my dog didn't like it. He prefers Knobbly-Wobblies. And I need to order more of them.
3,Let's be brief. Pick a reason Bush defeated Kerry.,"Here's one. You live in southeastern Ohio and you have one issue that is vital to the survival of the United States.1. You can't burn my flag.2. You can't register my guns.3. Man on man sex will ruin my marriage.4. I control my women's body.Pick one, only one. Guess what? Bush wins! You trump us all. You get the lying, unindictable, co-conspirator you deserve.You may also be a red neck, with one tooth, married to your cousin, I can't say."
2,Amazingly disappointing!,"I love Susan Krinard books, so may be I expected too much. The book is actually OK, but I was expecting a romance. This is more a sf/fantasy than romance. If you want romance you don't get ANY. As a fanatasy the book is OK, but the ending leaves you frustrated. You feel like you just spent hours having the scene set for the next book and you really didn't get anything of value out of this one. I won't make this mistake again. I'll get the sequel from the library."
2,Not for tough chewers,It was destroyed within 1 day with my bulldog pup- and then he started eating the pieces (which I quickly pulled out of his mouth).Cute toy but does not hold up well with chewers.
3,"Solid toy, but...","This is a solid toy made of heavy rubber. It doesn't look like it could be torn apart easily. However, I have 5 dogs and unfortunately none of them will play with this toy."
2,Don't like it,I can not attest to the durability of this toy because neither of my two dogs have touched it. They are just simply not interested in it.
1,DISAPPOINTED!,This lasted less than TEN minutes...durability = -5. I have an aggressive chewer but really expected more from a dog toy.
3,"Interesting for curious fans, but..","I read this book in one day so that should tell you something. It read quickly and wasn't too boring. Unfortunately it wasn't too exciting either. As a college and professional basketball fan, I enjoyed learning more about what goes on behind the scenes. I learned a lot about how competitive high school basketball is and how crazy recruiting works. I found Sebastian to be a fairly likable guy, but found his family somewhat greedy and money-hungry. I borrowed this book from my local library and wouldn't recommend anyone to pay money for it unless they are related to the author or a member of Sebastian's family. If I owned this book, I likely would NEVER pick it up again, much less read it."
3,an excellent service,"I received the item at home sooner than expected. Since I live in Catalonia, I wasn't waiting for it until a month or so but in 15 days it arrived and without having enroled special shipping conditions!"
3,"Good Movie, Really Bad Transfer","Four stars for the movie, zero for the transfer. There is a good story in there, coupled with good performances. Overall a good movie. The DVD transfer is really, really bad. Pan and scan with a disturbingly ugly result. Grain, bad color. Watching it on a large screen is outright unpleasant. Did I say the sound is bad too (dubbed). Looks like Simitar Video copied a VHS tape to DVD. Simitar Video should not be in the DVD transfer business. Hope someone else brings this otherwise fine movie to DVD - properly!"
5,Great Find!,"I picked up this book during a trip early this year. I began the usual thumbing through the pages, looking for something to grab my attention. I was pleased to discover how informative it was. I have grown up near many of the areas mentioned in this book. It turned out to be very enjoyable and educational reading. I especially enjoyed the authentic recipies. Great addition to the material :-)"
2,More of a Collector's Item,"This is NOT a documentary into the Apollo 1 disaster.Rather this is a tribute (largely in still photos) with a musical background for this occurrence.The DVD is ok if you are a collector of space or aeronautical historical events.If you are looking for the usual documentary into the tragedy, complete with footage and narration - stay away from this video.I watched it once (which took 2 separate sittings), and now it is in the library until someone else wants to view it."
3,Decent Enough,"I bought this after analyzing quite a few wraps to replace the one I had purchased at WalMart 5 years ago for $8.They dont carry ANY of these now, so I had to search online.I only use these to hold an icebag on my lower back after exercise about 5 times a week, nothing else.My Walmart one is thicker and lasted 5 years before it showed a tear in it.I've only used this Sportline once. Its material is thinner, but it seems okay. The velcro holds strong, but the long run quality cant be determined yet. It could break in a couple of months, or it could last years. it seems decent for the price, but theres no telling."
5,Review,I think this game is way better than the first and follows nicely because the game is action adventure and problem solving all in one.
4,THE MINISTERS~~~~,"HMMM... I love John Leguizamo,He's such an awesome actor... And he's BEAUTIFUL!!!Well the movie is a heart puller... sad at times.. Very EmoitionalHOWEVER JOHN LEGUIZAMO... I can look at him allllll day. Beautiful!!!"
2,"It grinds the coffee fine, but...","I got this grinder hoping for something that would grind coffee well for a french press. It did this just fine, but in the process it dusts a large portion of my kitchen counter with coffee grounds. This seems to stem from two problems. The first is that there is no seal between the grinder and the grounds container, which allows some coffee to fly out the sides when grinding. The second problem is that everything becomes so electrostaticly charged, that when you open the container the grounds scatter everywhere no matter how careful you are. I was very disappointed by this and am back to looking for a good grinder."
1,Problematic,"I too feel that initially, this grinder was awesome. But, after using it daily for several weeks, the doser became weakened because it sits too low and it continually jams up from the fine coffee grind accumulation. And, it is impossible to get assistance in replacing or exchanging after ordering it over the internet. The only option we were given, was to send it in for repair and wait 3 - 6 weeks, which is not an option for coffee addicts like us. Money down the drain."
1,nosey but It was free with the hedgehog,"I rescue a hedgehog that was neglected by its owner. She was my first hedgehog but she's been real good. She came with the wheel and man it made a screeching sound. I took it apart,oiled it and the screeching stopped. Now it's just the sound of my hedgehogs feet running real fast and wheel wobbling. It bothered my dogs and I started removing her cage into the bathroom every night.So, I wrapped some foam around the part that sticks to the metal prongs. now I hear her little feet but not the wheel. I also put a weight on the corners of the metal bottom because it'd move around the cage. I actually fell over on her, when she was running fast. Sometimes, it'd tip over onto the corner of the cage and she'd sit by it, sulking because she couldn't run.So, my minor alterations did help with the noise and movement.It's okay for now. I remember having rats and the wheel they had didn't make much noise but those were metal.I do plan to buy a quieter wheel."
4,"A real ""mixed bag "" based on ""1632"".","If you are reading the ""1632"" novels , then this is a real ""must read"". In a few of the stories , the reader is treated to a return to the Ring of Fire event as it happens ,only seen through differnt eyes : ""Power to the People"".Editor , and creator of the ""Ring of Fire"" concept , Eric Flint very cleverly sandwiches many short stories from a variety of authors between ""In the Navy"" , written by the second volume co-author David Weber , and his own contribution to the the collection , ""The Wallenstein Gambit"" , the last story in the volume.Some of the tales are rather light hearted ; others are perhaps a little turgid. My take on the book is definitely positive , but it is really difficult to rate . There are only one or two contributions that are a bit wanting in clarity and enjoyability. Overall a 4 star effort and a worthwhile read. I'm looking forward to ""1634 : The Galileo Affair""."
3,Missed opportuity,"I agree with what a previous reviewer said: this book missed the opportunity to discuss topics such as God, death, immortality, the meaning of life and human suffering. The basic idea is very touching: an angel visits a dying girl and engages her in a conversation (at times repetitive, as if Gaarder had run out of ideas concerning what an angel could or would say). The basic idea repeated over and over in the book is found in the title itself: we see reality as if through a glass, darkly (a quote from Paul's text 1 Cor 13:12). Being human has severe limitations: we will never be able to fully comprehend life, the universe, ourselves or even other people. Being an angel has limitations too: being incorporeal beings, they do not experience reality through the senses: hence, they do not know how to ""feel"" created realities and material bodies. The ending of the book is consoling: life continues after death."
3,Very basic,This book is good for beginners. It's simple and easy to follow. If you have a basic idea about surfing then you may need to look for something more advance.
2,Kensington wireless Expert Mouse,"The trackball itself is great, as is the accompanying software. But, yes, this thing does eat batteries like mad. If you don't really need a wireless version, you should by all means get the wired one (which is less expensive anyhow). But if you must have a wireless, be prepared for the hidden cost of buying batteries all the time, or, betteryet, getting some rechargeable C batteries and a recharger."
3,price was right,"first, i have not used it yet (sorry). but i had to comment, because how can this claim to be sterile when only parts of it are in sealed packaging? i decided to purchase it because i have never done this before so i didn't want to shell out a lot of cash for something i might not like but i did expect it to at least be packaged properly. everything was included, but i have no idea whose dirty hands were touching it..."
2,False Advertising - Does Not Come with Enema Bag......,"This set is supposed to come with the enema Bag.All I received is the bucket. Everything I received is fine. ButI will always believe it is bad business to advertise something,and then do not deliver.IF YOU WANT AN ENEMA BAG, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.If you don't care, then it seems to be the best you can getfor $6 plus shipping."
2,Interesting Experience,"So this was my first go at home enema/colon hydration. The bucket is really small. I would have preferred a larger bucket for better pressure. Also, the hose was really uncomfortable. It's better to input the hose farther to allow the water/hydration and while it's possible with this I don't think it's really geared for it. I'll be looking for a better product for a more consistent colon hydration."
2,Great Knives,"These knives are truly worth the money. However, it appeared I received a used set! There were water marks and the sealed plastic around each knife were open. Packaging very poor and it appeared the box had been opened and retaped.Too much of a hassle to send back. Knives are well balanced, and worth the price."
1,Stainless Steel shouldn't corrode... should it?,"We were really pleased when we first received and used this knife set. Its appearance was very professional, the handles very user friendly, and the edges were VERY sharp. However, after using the set and following the care directions for a few months, it became apparent that something was VERY wrong. The 3 1/4"" and 5"" blades started to show black spots and then began to corrode. Now the 3 1/4"" paring knife blade has so much decay that it can be nearly described as a serrated blade. The manufacturer offers a ""limited lifetime warranty"" so we will soon see what that means. We are very disappointed with this product at any price!"
2,No anomaly here you get what you pay for!,"Though these knives are made from an excellent quality steel the finish leaves much to be desired. Clearly lasar guided computer grinding is great if the knife blank is perfect, but one side was but the other side had a hollow that only a craftsman could correct, they work adequately, though the handle overlapping the bolster is a bit uncomfortable for a user who rides the blade with his forefinger to keep the knife from turning during use. The second finger would blister with any more than casual use.So in conclusion you get what you pay for, I own and use many different brands of knives, and find the hand finished models as a rule cost more and excede in quality those finished on a computer driven or lasar guided grinder."
1,Stainless steel!!??!,"I have never seen a knife that starts to rust when washed 3 times. The directions say to hand wash these, so I did, and after about the third washing of the butcher knife started getting little rust spots on both sides in random places... I'm returning these for a refund and checking out the bettwe selection Amazon has to offer..."
2,missled,"In item description seller is showing the whole electric comb package along W/ extra box of kit and thats what I perceived in a quick glance & ended up with useless blades of comb. It should picture & read extra teeth kit for comb.Remember online customer cannot window shop or touch to feel the product more so cannot see the seller for immediate response or body language,and that could be used as a strong tool as P.O.S. thankyou MOHDz"
5,butterfly kit,my daughter is excited to get this project underway.. either i didnt read everything up front.. didn't know we'd have to send off for the catapillars though..
4,Fun product,"I ordered this for my six year old, and she loved it as well as learning a lot about the cycle of life for these butterflies. The different steps along the way are very educational, and the reward is live butterflies for a few weeks. Since we have a garden, we fed them strawberries, then gave them a slice of banana every now and then, they seemed to thrive. Now the child has a net basket cage to catch lightning bugs!"
2,Hidden cost! Extra work! They should disclose that!,We just received this and I was shocked to discover that we have to enclose a payment in order to receive our caterpillars! I thought I already paid for this product! Why on earth wouldn't they include any additional cost in the initial payment?? Thank goodness we bought this for ourselves first instead of gifting it - I would be mortified to give a gift that cost the recipient money. Very disappointed in this product.
2,Bad customer service,"This is an ""OK"" item. The quality of the pop up cage could be better, but customer service is bad. It took a week for the larvae to arrive - and they were dead. There's a note on the container that says ""keep this end up"", and it was packed upside down in the box"". I contacted customer service via email and was told that the larvae tend to be 'sluggish' after mailing - and I had to give them a week to recover. A week later, they were still dead, and instead of offering to send a replacement shipment, they told me they were mailing me another coupon for more larvae...WTH? Would definitely not order this again - poor experience."
1,Even my 2 year old realized he was ripped off,"My son for months has danced around whenever he sees the commercial for Live Butterfly Garden on T.V. He looks at me and says ""Papa, please"" and ""Lots a fun!"" I finally ordered it. When we opened it and he saw the box he literally squealed with delight. After looking inside I quickly realized there were no caterpillars but a certificate that you have to mail in PLUS pay 5 dollars to get 3-5 caterpillars. I tried to make it positive saying ""Oh, in a few weeks we will get the caterpillars to turn into butterflies!"" After a few more seconds of looking he frowned, tossed it on the floor and said ""Oh, man."" He's two years old and knew he had just been ripped off. Disclose that info in the commercial please!!!"
1,Cannot order the butterflies!!,"Be careful if you order this and expect to receive the butterflies any time soon! Particularly from Amazon. Tried to order with the coupon, but was not able to as they cannot ship to Texas now due to the heat. Called customer service and was advised that Amazon was not informing customers of this when they order. She said there were 3 other states they could not ship to until September 17. Since this was for a 5 yr old, was very glad I had decided to order BEFORE giving this to her as it would have been a big disappointment to her. I think Amazon should either not sell this or provide full information. Of course the products customer service was aware that this is happening with Amazon. Just be careful if you are ordering where you live."
5,Amazing for kids (and very cool for adults too),We are thrilled with our butterfly garden. It is so cool to watch the caterpillers grow and change into butterflies. We are homeschoolers so this is an all around unit study for our family. My only complaint is that you should know that ordering the larvae is going to cost you extra. I ordered a kit a few years ago and it came with a certificate to send for the butterflies. They were $3. We just ordered another kit as gift. The caterpillers certificate in there cost $5. Luckily they were good friends and after the present was opened I took the certificate so I could send for the caterpillers myself. Otherwards I would have given $3 with the gift to pay for the larvae (forgetting about inflation). But it is a great kit. I know we will order caterpillers time and time again!!
1,rip-off,"I'm very angry about this product, which Amazon should not be selling. It is not revealed that the only thing that arrives is the butterfly cage. Not the caterpillers themselves or the food. You have to send in more money for that! Totally not disclosed! To make matters worse, they don't ship them to Hawaii! Please return my money or credity my account immediately."
4,Fun but replacement is costly,"My kids (6 and 4) and I loved this gift--both fun and educational--and all 5 of our caterpillars survived to be released. We received this as a gift and although I didn't mind paying the extra $3 to ship the caterpillars, Insect Lore now has a version you can purchase from their site that includes the live bugs already in the box in case that's an issue for the gift giver. My only complaint is that the cost to order replacement butterflies seems awfully high."
1,Not what you think!,The Box clearly states a coupon inside for 5 caterpillars and inside it says 3-5 caterpillars.The company will not honor what is on the box. Be careful. You DON'T get what you pay for with this product.Customer service is of no help.
3,No butterfly eggs for Canada.,"It would have been helpful to know that there were no butterfly eggs in the kit, that they had to be ordered separately, and that they could not be sent to Canada.So far we are unable to use the kit for the above reasons, and therefore not able to rate this toy."
4,Gestation of the Monarch,I purchased this to share with my grandson. We had a great time watching the steps....picked the milkweed with the little tiny eggs - watched the hatching of the caterpillar - eating the milkweed - and then finally cocooning and then turning into the butterfly. He did not want to let the butterfly fly free.....Took a little convincing!!!!!
5,Butterfly Garden,My Daughter loves the butterfly garden. I did find it cheaper at wal mart I guess its my fault for not shopping around. We sent the coupon in for the caterpillars and in about a week and a half we had them. The directions were easy to follow and hopefully in a few days we see the emerge as beautiful butterfly's.
2,Items not included,"Sent as a gift for my granddaughter, who went from instant excitement to unhappy. The only thing in the box was the cage. No card to send in, no instructions, nothing. Can we say DISAPPOINTED?"
5,SO FUN!,"THIS ITEM IS THE BEST! YOU GET TO WATCH YOUR EGGS HATCH, THEN FORM A CACOON, THEN WATH THEM TURN INTO BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES ITS GREAT!!! :)"
1,Plan on a very long wait!,"Purchased this for my daughter and I sent in my coupon for the butterflies, it has been a week and still no sign of it. After calling and waiting for 20 minutes to speak to someone on the phone she checked her system and we weren't in it. We would have to wait till next Tuesday to see and make sure it was there. Then it would take another week to get here. The customer service woman was not helpful one bit and I am still without anything for my daughter. Sneaky marketing is what it is to buy a product and then to spend more money to actually get the caterpillars. Horrible customer service. She did offer that I spend 40$ to overnight the stuff, but sorry we don't do anything extra. Can you tell I am very frustrated! I put one star because I don't have the actual toy to rate and that is a big deal in the quality of the product."
5,Great Customer Service,We purchased this in March. A month later we had not received the caterpillars. One email to customer service resolved this. They indicated that the first shipment must have been lost in the mail and they promptly sent a second set (no additional charge). Our 4 year old is extremely happy! I will definitely purchase additional products from Insect Lore.
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I ordered my butterfly farm in June so we could have the butterflies during my Daughter's birthday party in early July. The idea was to let the kids release the butterflies together. Well, little did I know (because there was no indication or disclaimer), they DO NOT ship to my state in the summer. The website said ""hot weather may cause a delay"", it does not say you'll have to wait until next season. Needeless to say, I did not get my butterflies. If I had any inkling that this was going to be an issue, I would not have purchased the kit. The straw that broke the camels back?.... I called customer service and recieved the runaround, their staff are extremely rude and not at all helpful. I'm so disappointed, it was going to be a great activity for the kids at my daughters party, and a good educational opportunity for my daughter! Save yourself the trouble, only buy this product if you know for sure that you'll be getting your butterflies. Ugh!"
1,Would be great if I could actually get some caterpillars,"I ordered this for my daughter's fifth birthday. I placed the order for the caterpillar larvae 7 business days before her birthday so that worst case they would arrive on her birthday. That was over three weeks ago. All she has is a container for keeping imaginary butterflies in. Lamest birthday present ever. Customer service is useless. I emailed them a week ago, never heard back. Called them five days ago, their computer was down. Tried to call again today and can't even get through. I'm giving up and sending it back. Don't waste your money."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this for my 4 year old neice for Christmas. She received many many Christmas gifts but said this was her favorite. Although she lives in a different state I get regular updates on the butterflies. My sister has called numerous times to tell me how great it has been. My niece has now looked up (with help of course) butterfly websites, she is getting information from the library on butterflies and learning a lot.Her and her mom are going to be planting a butterfly garden this summer so it really carries over into other activites.I would highly recommend this and have!"
2,"disappointed, additional cost & shipping time","I must say I was very disappointed to receive this product only to find that the larvae don't ship with the product! If you go directly to the website insectlore.com you can buy gardens that ship with the larvae... so you get it all at once. I'm disappointed we have to pay an additional $5 now to get the larvae, and it will take an extra 3-7 business days... UGH! My daughter's birthday is in 3 days, guess we'll only be able to give her half of this present. Very very very disappointed. I wish I'd just gone directly to insectlore and bought from them."
5,larvae arrived fine...,"So my greatest concern was whether our larvae would make it to us alive and they did. They are growing so fast! And I'm so glad some reviewers mentioned having to order the larvae after you buy this garden, well it made sense but it didn't occur to me before then. I ordered ours online for $3 and they arrived in just a few days. My son is almost 4 and really doesn't like bugs but he really is enjoying this! Assume all of the larvae grew to beatiful butterflies unless I follow up and report otherwise! And BTW I got the butterfly garden for $13 on amazon."
3,A WW2 Flyer,"I read this book back in the 70's. I recently brought a used copy of it. The second time around, the book was a tad of a let down. But still the action sequences were good. I don't know if Whip is a real person or not, but the modifications done to the bomber had been done. IE removing the glass observation dome and replacing it with a nest of machine guns/cannons.If you like aircrfta war stories, then you might like this one."
2,hand-held Black and Decker vacuum,"I bought this because of its low price. Not bad, but there is a major flaw in the design. The left side air exhaust blows in a downward direction, disturbing the pile of dirt you are trying to pick up and just blowing it around before you can pick it all up. The good news is that if you angle it greatly and work from left to right, it works OK."
1,Threw it in the trash after about a year,It couldn't hold a charge for long. Blew air in our faces. Didn't pick up well and after about a year stopped working. I threw it in the trash.
4,Can't beat this price,"We use our Dustbuster every day, to pick up the inevitable Dog Hair in the Corners (tm). It always has good suction, is easily charged, easy to open and empty -- for the fabulous price of only $15. We also have a handheld Dyson, which cost over $100, only gets about 1 minute of use before it needs charging, is complicated to empty -- I could have bought SIX dustbusters for the price of the over-priced unit. Oh well. Live and learn."
3,black and decker cordless handvac CHV4800,i love this handvax. i replaced for an old one that lasted me for about 9 years. but this one seems to lack a good motor. it isnt as forceful as my old one. is there a reason for that?
1,total piece of garbage,"The batteries croak within minutes. Over time, the battery life gets shorter and shorter. By the end, it would go for maybe 30 seconds. With, incidentally, incredibly weak suction. Then it died. Won't turn on at all now, even when plugged in. That's why I'm on amazon.com, on this page: I'm searching for a replacement! Not this. Never again."
4,Occasional use,"I got this for work. I eat lunch at my desk, and am on a carpeted floor. Sometimes things get away and into the rug. I'm not planning to wait for the cleaners to give me a vacuum once or twice a year - so before I head out, I spend 20 seconds doing a dust up and things are looking fine."
2,"Good price, mediocre vacuum","Pros: good price, convenient size, lightweightCons: very low suction, very short battery life (a little more than 5 minutes maximum), relatively easy for particles to flow out of the vacuum"
3,Works ok - but didn't last long,"Ours worked fine -but only lasted about 2 years. So, don't pay too much for it or expect long life."
1,After a year this thing wouldn't recharge anymore,"This thing won't recharge anymore, it is permanently dead. Now I have to buy a better more expensive one. The one reviewer is right, you do get what you pay for."
2,Power on switch is too flimsy,I have to say I like the look and feel of this rather inexpensive little hand vac (I have it hanging on the wall right out in the open of my kitchen). The big problem however is the very cheap little piece of white plastic which moves the on-off switch slips off of the motor after it is turned on once or twice. I was going to try to screw in a sturdier piece that might stay attached but after seeing the price I'll just by a more expensive model which hopefully won't have this problem. Not being able to turn it on is a very big problem.
3,B&D Cordless Handheld vacuum,"Works well. Gotta keep it cleaned out and charged. Not the absolute strongest super handvac I've ever used, but perfectly adequate and well priced. It gets the job done."
3,Adequate,"It does the job it's supposed to do, and the price was so low that it really made a very good buy."
1,It sucks but not in a good way,"I have bought two dust busters in three years. They do work great for small things like lint and hair, etc. However at some point within a year maybe a year and a half with little usage (a couple of times a week for a couple of minutes at the most) it will not charge anymore. You do get what you pay for and I will be buying from another manufacturer."
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a college student and I purchased this vaccum to remove the hair, lint etc that always gets into my dorm room rug. After trying the vaccum out I quickly found out that it was not going to get the job done. However I still use the vaccum because its perfect for cleaning up messes on hardware surfaces."
2,ugh!,"The title of this book intrigued me so I decided to give it a try. As a native Clevelander, what did the city do to this author? Her veiled cuts at the city wore thin rather quickly. I'm sorry that the midwest is not nearly as cosmopolitan as New York. What would possess Lily (she being a 25 year cosmopolitan woman of NYC and not a gauche country bumbpkin Buckeye) to accept a marriage proposal after a few months without being able to tell her fiance she loves him? A book that started out with lots of promise but ended up a big waste of time."
1,It's an accident alright,"Reading this tale of a pathetic, dysfunctional woman and her stupid, tiresome life feels like rubbernecking a multiple car accident in which no one was wearing a seat belt. The ""heroine,"" Lily, is clueless almost to the point of retardation, and her family and friends are two dimensional if they're lucky. It is impossible to suspend disbelief to the extent required to believe in one single exchange of dialogue or one single thought ascribed to any of these absurd characters. The only vaguely redeeming things about this irritating book are a couple of snappy oneliners and a Martha Stewart spoof, but that's just not enough to make it worth the price of admission, or even the time it would take to borrow it from the library...."
1,"Absolutely Tedious, Boring, and Not Worth Reading","This book was AWFUL! The characters were wooden and void of personality, the author apparently tried to interject wry humor into her book --but was highly unsuccsessful. I did not even bother finishing the book, just tossed it aside with no intention of passing it on to anyone. I cannot believe the glowing reviews that were given to this book by literary critics --were they paid off?"
3,Viewer,"David Suchet is always good, but these newer shows lack the writing and production talent shown in the earlier collections. At first, I thought the trouble might be the missing characters of the Inspector, Hastings or the secretary who added so much to the show, but it is something more.There is difficulty with choppy scene transitions and the script adds nonsense sex scenes, etc., that do not move the plot along and seem out of place for the series. Usually, this indicates lazy writing. So, I'm somewhat disappointed, but David Suchet saves the collection with his excellent acting.Bring back the earlier script writers and the other characters that truly round out the Hercule Poirot character."
2,Agatha Christie's Poirot - Classic Crimes Collection,"David Suchet is the definitive Hercule Poirot. Many actors, including luminaries such as Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney have portrayed Christie's Belgian dectective, but none have brought the character to life as well as Suchet. That said I must admit that I am terribly disappointed in this series. The characterizations and portrayals are excellent, but for Christie fans who have read the books on which these four episodes are based the results will be disappointing at best. One has to wonder if the writers who ""adapted"" these stories read the original works! Christie's works can stand on their own and lend themselves easily to dramatization. In these episodes (and perhaps others) extreme license has been taken. While I enjoy David Suchet's portrayal of Hercule Poirot I believe that in future I will stick to the original material - the books themselves."
2,"Why EDITED versions, A&E?","My poor rating has nothing to do with the adaptations (which I thought were well done and atmospheric.) It's always a pleasure to see David Suchet as Poirot. On the contrary, I have a beef with the presentation on these DVDs. They were clearly cut to fit into A&E time slots - with annoying dips to black in the middle of music cues - and censored for language. At one point a character exclaims ""God Dammit, Poirot"" but the sound drops out where he says ""God."" That's all well and fine for A&E's standards and practices, but when I spend the money on a DVD, I want the full length, uncensored presentation as it was meant to be seen - without artificial breaks in the continuity for commercials. Shame on you, A&E - you can do much better!"
1,Mystery of the Blue Train,"This video is awful. I couldn't even watch the whole thing. The characters seemed awfully silly and there was no continuity. It was just a jumbled mess. If this is the ""new Poirot"", I want no part of it."
3,Not enough information about the people,"It was too short, and not enough information about what led them to that belief system. I would have liked more details."
4,RARE 65MM FILM FROM 1930,"This is a must for people interested in the early widescreen films that were made between 1929 an 1931. (11 features). Only one has been considered as being lost.That was FOX MOVIETONE FOLLIES OF 1929 (70MM). I have nine of the films on dvd that were made and am only missing KISMET (1931) and Fox Follies. A SOLDIER'S PLAYTHING was filmed in 65mm (Vitascope).This film ,when first released, used interlocked Vitaphone discs for the soundtrack.Does anyone have a copy of KISMET (1931)? I would be interested in buying a copy."
2,Headband not fastened well,Tiara looked nice but the band that keeps it on broke the first time my daughter tried to wear it.
2,Looks Great! Assembly May be Required,"I bought the crown last minute for my Halloween costume. It arrived just in time. When I went to put it on, though, the elastic tore right through the foam, taking a chunk with it. I had to sew on new elastic at the very last minute and it ended up being too big. It was a hassle to keep on my head all night.Although it looked very realistic, and I got a ton of compliments, I will probably have to readjust the elastic if I ever want to wear it again. But, I Will want to wear it again because it does look really good (as long as you don't get too close to my own sewing job)."
2,Ok book. Did not meet expectations.,"I was disappointed with this book. The reviews I had read on it made it sound like it would be really funny. I did not find most of the book funny and felt the only way to relate to what was going on in the book would be if I was a hoity-toity, self-centered rich or materialistic person. I am neither, so I found a lot of the things in this book hard to relate to and not funny. I have read a few really funny books about pregnancy and breastfeeding, like ""How My Breasts Saved the World"" and I had hoped this book would give me the same amount of laughs. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."
2,So disappointed,"I bought this drill from Amazon 6 years ago with 2 batteries. I used it hard for 3 years and the batteries died. I limped along for another year and ordered another battery. That drill has lasted about a year and the battery is still good. However, the drill has died completely. I am a homeowner and not a professional.I did a lot of research before I bought this drill. Never again"
2,bowling,"I was wanting the PC version not the playstation 1. I don't own a playstation one, two, or three. I"
3,Needed better proofing,"A nice looking book, but as I get into it the need for better editorial work is showing. The battle of Pharsalus is mistakenly placed in Thrace instead of in Thessaly, and two pages later the battle of Philippi is called the battle of Pharsalus! Another reviewer noted that Tacitus is misspelled in the Foreword. This book was published in 1995, so things like this should have been fixed by now. Maybe the rest will be acccurate, but so far it does not inspire confidence."
1,They need a paperboy! Someone to deliver on-time!,"Talk about disappointed! I have subscribed to the Kindle edition for five months. The AJC, in their infinite wisdom, stopped delivering the hard copy edition to my area in January. The Kindle edition was a godsend! For a while!Lately, the Kindle edition has either been late or not provided at all --like this past Sunday and Monday. I refuse to allow the AJC and Kindle to continue to abuse me. I have canceled my subscription. For the first time in about 37 years, I will not be receiving the AJC. Their loss, not mine. I'll read the NYT on-line!"
1,Delivery problems,We were a long term subscriber for home delivery until they eliminated us from their service area. I thought I would try the Kindle version but inconsistent and late delivery make it of little value. It's unfortunate but I wonder how much longer Atlanta will have a viable newspaper?
2,OK if it shows up,"I've had the AJC on Kindle about a month. So far, this is the first time I've had the problem everyone speaks of - neither Sat 8/8 or Sun 8/9 editions showed up (a message was sent saying there was a problem and it would be sent later, but as of Sunday afternoon, neither weekend paper arrived.)There are also frequent careless mistakes in the AJC on Kindle - for example, you'll see ""headline goes here"" or something like that in the text.AJC cut a lot of staff and I have to wonder if they have some intern doing this....."
5,Another must-read from Beevor,"Beevor's books are among the best in the latest wave of historical works on Russia's participation in World War 2. Benefitting from access to Soviet-era archives (and outwitting his Russian minders), Beevor has been able to bring to shed new light on such already seemingly thoroughly covered events as battles for Stalingrad and Berlin. The result is a far more gritty and more realistic depiction of the war than can be found in many other historical works. The honesty with which Beevor has tackled his subject has apparently even earned him the hostility of the Russian government."
4,Not very ground breaking but still highly engaging,"This book breaks little ground, and is not therefore going to be valuable to scholars. It draws heavily on previous studies, even though this is seldom acknowlegeded. It is gripping and very sad, though, especially when it reveals what horrors German women and children endured. Very good but not as good as author's previously book on Stalingrad."
1,Not credible,I have to agree with some of the negative reviews of this book: the factual basis for the author's allegations is almost non-existent. The author just took whatever unverified information of personal nature he could get and used it in support of his agenda. There are a lot of accusations. History - I just don't see it in this book.
1,Tom Clancy writing history?,"Bought Beevor's ""The Fall of Berlin 1945"" for four dollars (including shipping and handling). Read it. Want my money back.Many interesting facts that never happened. Smacks of something one would find in the gossip column of a supermarket tabloid (I understand Beevor had much experience there). I read Beevor's ""Stalingrad"", so I knew he is not a historian or a good writer. So, I suppose, I have only myself to blame. But then four bucks wasn't too expensive.I can live with this guy insulting my grandfather: so he doesn't like Russians; so he likes Nazis; everyone's entitle to their own opinion. My mistake was that I thought this was a history book and not an alternate reality novel a la Tom Clancy or Victor Suvorov. Oops."
2,Panasonic Drill 12V,"The drill itself was excellent in feel and operation. I liked that it had a NiMH battery and great balance. But, the chuck constantly clicks when you load or unload a bit. Instead of the smooth turning I'm used to in a drill, you can't easily turn or spin the chuck. I took the drill to a repair center and was advised that this was normal for Panasonic and that you needed to use the motor to spin down the chuck to the bit, not easy when using a small bit. The tech also noted the battery was manufactured 3 years ago. I returned the drill and bought a Mikita Li-ion 18v, very happy."
4,my pick for 12 volt,"I,ve had them all, and you get what you pay for, fortunately Amazon helps on that end. Go ahead and get the best, you will only cry once."
5,Panasonic 12 volt,We have been using panasonic cordless drills since 1989They are the absolute best cordless drills on the market!Wilmer GingerichDaco Electric Co
3,It's ok,"I may be using it wrong, but I don't like the curve surface. Maybe it would work better for soft cheese (maybe that's what it's intended for), but we grate Romano at the table, and this grater does not work well -- not enough surface area, so you have to grate longer. It LOOKS nice and matches the peeler; also is fine in the dishwasher."
4,Pretty good 80's sci-fi.,The technology can be a bit cheesy at times but the story is good. Lots of action and interesting characters. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series! I give it four stars.
5,"Comfy, warm, good price","Bought this helmet for my son, who is very happy with it. Fits well, comfortable, no complaints about using it."
4,Item was what I expected,"The book was in good condition and arrived quick enough. I were happy to get it, had been reading it on a tea shop."
1,Worst thing I ever got thru Amazon,"The picture on the box would lead you to think that you would be getting a skeleton, with separate bones for each digit of the hand, etc. In reality, it was a bag of plaster and some molds. The molds were not for individual bones, but for a whole hand as a blob with some bone-looking detail on top. Same for the head, feet, and other parts of the body. What a scam!"
5,Best choice for tall feet,"This Boot fits perfect, has a great stability even for tall men with high weight and it is just very comfortable to wear and keep walking the whole day ...(I ordered it in US because my size 48 was not available in EU, I live in Sweden, and the delivery took only ten days, best buy, best service)"
1,Do not last...the are failing apart at the seams after 1 week of wear!,I have bought ECCO brand boots for my husband for years but the last pair I bought came unsewn and were falling apart after about a month. I thought that it was a fluke and maybe something just happened to that pair. I was out almost $200.00 for the boots and shipping cost. I ordered a pair for him for Christmas gift as a replacement (12/19). He wore them for about a week and the same thing started to happen - falling apart at the seam! Should last longer for the $!!!
1,Disappointed,Not the quality of ecco of the past ur better off buying cheaper shoesand saving ur money like all companies anymore money is priority one those earth shoes walmart used to sell were better quality and a whole lot cheaper anyway very disappointed
5,A wonderful book,This is a marvelous little book on Celtic Spirituality. The authors use both well-known and lesser-known saints as icons into spiritual wisdom. You will find this book is both a great read and useful tool for understanding the spirituality of the Celtic Saints - and applying their wisdom to everyday life.I have used this book with high school students and adults and all have enjoyed the wisdom that can be gleaned from these pages. This book is useful for both those new to Celtic Spirituality and the Celtophile.
1,Didn't work,"Basically, the charger just didn't work. It was the correct one, but must have been defective. It was cheap enough that it's not worth my time returning it."
5,Lovely fragrance,"I discovered this fragrance in a cruise ship duty-free shop several years ago. Why I didn't buy it at the time, I'll never know. It took me a year, and another cruise, to finally make my first purchase. Chanel Chance is heavenly (and a little devilish at the same time). I enjoy its light, refreshing scent all day and into the night. I use it daily for work, evenings for dinner out, travel, anytime. I've seen other reviews about the fragrance not lasting very long; I personally find that it lasts all day and think it might vary from person to person. I still wear other pleasant fragrances from time to time but Chance is now my signature scent. I can honestly say this is the most enjoyable fragrance I've ever had the pleasure to wear and it's at the top of my wish list! (Note: I have not purchased Chance or any other fragrances from this vendor so I cannot make a recommendation about them.)"
5,makes life easier,works great on all different sizes... easy to hold. no rubber on handle (i like that). goes through diswasher. glad i bought it!
4,Power without batteries!,I got this Garmin compatible cigarette lighter power adapter for my Garin GPS 60CSX. It works great in my vehicle. It powers the gps unit without using up your batteries. The only complaint I have is that it will come out of the unit easily if you handle the unit to much. Other than that it great that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. It shipped quickly and got to me in a timely manner as well.
3,SCARED OFF BY NEGATIVE REVIEWS,"I did not go through with the purchase of this product due to the negativity in the reviews. I felt that I was going to pay more in the long run for the replacement of the bulb. All in all, Amazon was very compassionate during the refund process and very understanding. Do not let this sway you, nothing ""electronically"" was wrong with the product."
4,Great TV,"The TV is very nice and has spoiled me already. I don't like the intensity not being as bright as an LCD, however, losing the screen lag offered by LCD's is a great tradeoff. It would be nice if the viewing angle were a little better, but it's acceptable. I've had this TV for a few weeks and I can say that I would buy this TV again if I were purchasing right now."
5,"execellant quality, simply adorable","When my grandson tore off the wrapping paper & climbed on to the tiny trike for the first time his face absolutely glowed. He loves to push along with his feet and yell ""VROOM VROOM"". The real wood quality construction insures that his newborn sister will have great fun with this toy when she is old enough. This is a toy that you know can be passed from child to child."
4,"Sturdy, clean slicing plane","The Hoffritz Cheese Plane is sturdy, and clean slicing. Just the right thickness. It is fairly attractive as well. Recieved promptly and in excelent condition."
2,Not as good as I had thought,"Bought this battery to replace the original LG one that does not hold more than a day. But this one does not perform much better either. It holds charge only for 2-3 days if you don't use it. if you enable bluetooth, then it will be gone in a day."
3,For beginners...,This video gives very general tips some of which can be a little difficult to understand. If you're already doing pretty well at fishing then this probably isn't for you. This isn't a fishing show so don't get it expecting to watch fishing.
1,Bulb is Weak Link,Bought this item last Christmas for my wife. Worked fine until this Thanksgiving when rubber bulb split apart when basting turkey. She had complained when I bought this fancy one to replace her old ugly plastic one last year but I insisted this was better. Boy am I in trouble now. Old plastic one had lasted for 10 years and cost 1/10 as much. Did not look like much but it did the job.
1,Bulb splits,"It was a great baster for the few times we used it over 2 years, but the rubber bulb suddenly developed a large split which rendered it useless."
5,helpful and informative,"I found Ms. Hobey's book to be delightful and informative. The transition of having a new child and transitioning back to work had been so overwhelming...I was ill prepared.However,this book really gave me the guidance I was needing. ""The Working Girls Guide..."" is cleverly written and a pleasure to read. I definitely will buy a copy for all of my expectant friends."
1,How convenient; arrogance and stupidity wrapped in one!,"I won't even get started on how poorly this book was written. Alas, such a book shouldn't really be judged on things such as grammar and syntax. It should however be judged on how insightful it is, the author's understanding of basic principles, and fair coverage of both sides of each debate. This book FAILS in all those regards. I must admit it is quite humorous to read Leslie state the obvious and act like he's just discovered a remarkable fact and is enlightening the world. I must say it's scary and disturbing that my school actually made me read this."
2,I don't think anybody needs this book,hockeydb.com is a much better source for hockey stats info and that is free yes the stats are good and it is nice to have them on hand without a computure but really why would you need them if your at a game you'd have to search through the book to get what you want
5,dschlvr,An outstanding recording.Have the stereo and MC recording. Enjoy both equally.What is wonderful is the organ like quality of the final movement.I have owned many Mahler 3's.This seals my search for a great Mahler 3!!!
1,Nice looking Junk,"Great Looks, Accurate I guess, but very cheaply built. The tempered glass scale platform is held in place by a step down plastic stem, which will break if in any kind of mis-loaded/side loaded/off centered position.I don't bad mouth most products that I buy, but the title says it all, great looking junk.Getting me to the point of not buying anything made in China, but that is not the point, the manufacture sets the goal post, the factory just delivers what they are told to. I personally will not buy anything branded by Newline again."
1,5 Star Movie; 1 Star DVD,"The Internet Movie Database says this movie runs 85 min but the USA version is 100 min. The disc released by Intermedia Video has most of the graphic sex cut out. Furthermore, the scene in which a woman has demons exorcised by a witchdoctor is gone. The ""doctor"" literally blows smoke up her butt!!!"
1,mondo magic,"The DVD versions of this movie are incomplete as well as the VHS versions produced in the late 90s. I saw the original it has scenes of voodoo, santaria, satanism that take place in Haiti, Brazil and the united states. These scenes are now removed from the DVD and VHS tapes produced in the late 90s. Shop your local mom and pop video stores or flea markets if you find a tape produced in the 80s buy it. The DVD and VHS versions that are being offered are sanitized and have 15 to 30 minutes removed from them..."
4,It works,"Honestly, I can't tell if I jump higher or run faster but I can certainly say I feel less pain in my joints and last longer on the court."
3,Casio G-Shock #G1800D-3A,This is a quality watch although it appeared nicer in the pictures. For the price there are nicer timepieces on the market.
4,Beautifully written tale of young boy in rural England,"You can feel the emotions of this young boy as he tells of his life after the death of his grandmother, whose pet pig he has decided to care for. He also takes the responsibility of visiting his infirm grandfather -- both are outsiders in their neighborhood and family except for one young Pakistani girl -- the only touch of sweetness in both their lives."
3,"This book is very outdated, especially concerning the prices","Just a short note. Apart from the very positive things said by other reviewers, here some more negative feedback: I can speak only for the section on Samoa!The accommodations in the guide have no personal touch, not the slightest recommendation or impression how they are. It is basically only information about what they offer. I was expecting a bit more information that would help me choose. Then, from 2004 until now the prices have tripeled or quadrupeled!! this is pretty bad, as you can completely forget the pricing level given here for Samoa.It seems after the Pacific games that there had been a lot of changes.I will be on Samoa this August and will update my impression on the guide accodingly. It is very unfortunate that there is no more up to date guide available."
4,Had for over a year,"These have worked great on my small trees and shrubs. Theyre still going strong and I haven't had to change any batteries. Maybe not for taller trees and shrubs, but good light for smaller."
5,Great Product,I have two sets of these spotlights. The remote solar panel is a great idea. I have placed it in an area that gets sun most of the day. These lights are both clear and bright. I have one spotlight illuminating a US flag. The top of the flag is 7 feet above the spotlight and the spotlight has no problem reaching and lighting the flag. The others I use to illuminate bushes along my walkway and around my patio fence.
2,I have seen the light... not!,"Based on the statement, ""Our most powerful solar floodlight... provide improved light output,"" I purchased three sets. Unfortunately, the light output is very disappointing. IMHO, you shouldn't expect anything more than mere accent lighting from this unit. To refer to these as ""floodlights"" is to misrepresent this product. There certainly is no flood of light, so don't expect to light up the night. I've got a brighter flashlight on my keychain."
1,expensive for short life span & light output,"Solar LED landscape flood lights still have much to improve. They produce minimal light at best. But the REAL complaint about this set is that the solar charger died within 10 months of purchase.The solar charger had a symbol on it indicating that it should not be discarded in the trash. If all of the companies that manufacture solar chargers produce units that fail within months,how can this be better for our environment considering this toxic, poorly manufactured ""green"" technology will end up in landfills across the country?For my family this purchase represents a very expensive contribution to the green movement. We will replace this solar LED set with regular landscape lights & gladly pay the extra $1 per year electrical expense for lights we know will last for several years."
4,Gurren Lagann Reaches Expectations and More,"Gurren Lagann is one of the better series I have watched. It's by Gainex, who are well known for past works such as FLCL and Neon Genesis Evangelion. The animation is amazing and fresh. The plot is full of energy, action, and doesn't plod along. The characters are original, fun and humerous. Each episode is enjoyable and never stands at a still. This anime is worth your time even though it might not be everyone'scup-o'-tea."
4,Great!,"This is a typical Olivia Newton-John video - Great. From the creative video of ""Twist of Fate,"" which is set in a court room while showing various clips from the movie, ""Two of a Kind."" The very moving song, ""Shaking You"" is in Venice and is truely a beautiful video. There are also the videos to ""Take a Chance,"" ""Heart Attack,"" Livin' in Desparate Times,"" and ""Tied Up."" Any Olivia fan has to have this video. It is both energetic and fun. You will love it. John Travolta is also in it twice. This video and the soundtrack more than make up for the only so-so movie."
3,Cymbals,The cymbals arrived on time and were in okay condition. They were a little banged up. I wish they were in better condition.
5,Beautiful and Compelling,"My name is Doug Hiser, author of the 2006 novel,The Honey Bee Girl. I have been reading and collecting Alice Hoffman books since I discovered Turtle Moon. I have read them all and The Fortelling is my favorite. I loved her narrative and moving story. In some ways it reminded me of Clan of the Cave Bear and also of mystical ancient cultures that we see only in dreams. Alice Hoffman's prose is the main reason I fell in love with her books. She is the magic realism of writing the way Michael Parks is of the dreamlike reality of art and Frank Frazetta is the master of fantasy painting. The Fortelling is a short work of literary genius accessible to everyone. She has deep intense knowledge of the emotions and feelings that most people can only guess about. Discover her writing through this compelling work and then find your way into her other books. You won't be disappointed. Doug Hiser"
3,Not my favorite Martin book,"I didn't much like the ""Dying man on a dying planet"" theme. Rather depressing and philosophical for my taste. Liked most of the characters and, as usual for Martin, very imaginative sci-fi. Can't really recommend it. Still there have been many who really liked it so maybe it's just me."
2,Forgettable,"I have read one book previously by this author and don't recall what it was about. I've only read the first 100 pages and then skipped to the last chapter. I could easily pass on the rest because the whole story was laid out in the last chapter.I find the subject of sexual abuse being a tiresome plot in book after book. It hardly comes as a surprise anymore. In this story it was certainly wide spread for a long time and had terrible repercussions.So if this book comes your way,just read the last chapter and it'll be a thorough synopsis of the whole long long book."
4,Educational,I really like most of Greg Isles books ..Blood Memory really gave me a great insight regarding child abuse. I will certainly recommend it to many of my friends.
5,BUY IT NOW....,"This is a great book with great characters and a super storyline. The author captured my interest from page one and lead me on an emotional ride to the very exciting and emotional ending. This is one book I know I will read again and highly recommend. Buy it now, read it today!!!!"
2,"On the merits, not so good","If you have emotional issues about child abuse, read this book. If you are looking for a well written narrative murder mystery, you will be disappointed. It's punctuated by very long repetitive, meaningless dream sequences, pages & pages of zero plot advancement and an index of cliches. Pure schlock for a target market that is easily pleased if you punch the right buttons.I'll leave Iles to agenda seekers."
2,Good Plot....But poor representation in other areas......,"Catherine Ferry is Beautiful but Arrogant and has issues that she figures out in the end....But the African-Americans in this book are portrayed in this dumb and subservient and not very eloquent in their speech. Stereotypes are reinforced in those characters. Maybe that's the way it is in the south, or maybe that's all the author has ever met, but it's definitely not that way in the Pacific Northwest. The Author needs to travel out of his little area of the world a bit and meet some people."
1,25 missing pages turn Blood Memory into a failure,Greg Iles is a fantastic writer who has kept my intrest for 396 pages when all of a sudden the paperback version put out by Pocket Star Books and Simon Says goes back to page 373 and continues to page 396 again. The next page after that is page 421..in other words there are 25 pages missing in this book .. all in an area that is absolutely necessary to understanding the story. This of course is not the authors fault but the printers and I am upset about the whole thing. My biggest complaint is that the publisher has provided no way to complain directly So MY ONLY WAY OF TRYING TO CORRECT ANYTHING WAS TO WRITE DIRECTLY TO MR. ILES. If you buy this book check to see if those pages are in your copy before starting to read it.
3,"""Bloody"" Memory","I think P. Cornwall does a better job of this type story. Didn't hold my interest, but I'm not into incest or pedophilia."
2,The Rich Get Richer and The Poor Get Prisone,"I found this book to be very questionable in its content. It delivered ideas well, but regurgitated them beyond sense. I found myself interested in the first chapter, then found myself reading the same thing over again. Also, Reiman tries to implement the idea that poor people deserve a college education! He puts it in between life necessities such as shelter, food, and jobs. Excuse me, Dr. Reiman, but I'd appreciate it if my college education actually has value. I enjoyed the first chapter, but found myself questioning the integrity of this book as I began the third chapter. Everyone has the opportunity; there are different means and obstacles we encounter, but the deserving part irked me a little bit."
4,Intermediate Biztalk without Proofreading,"The substance of this book is very good, if too wordy. There is no doubt that the authors have a firm grasp of their subject; now they just need to be concise in discussing it. As stated in the book, the book is designed for readers who have a basic familiarity with BizTalk -- however note that readers are expected to be familiar with MS operating systems and some scripting and programming languages. Not having this knowledge will make this book difficult to follow, especially in the examples.Since the advent of the spell checker, no one proofreads any more. The book is rampant with errors. For example, the text will state that five parameters are required, then list six. In one case the publishing tool boldly inserts ""ERROR! Reference source not found"" when the text references a figure... Still, I'll give it high recommendations for content."
2,Tenchi VS. RPG,"After playing Dungeons and dragons and many White wolf games, this game was a great dissapointment. But for ANYONE who loves tenchi and wants to role play in the tenchi enviroment, then this book is for you. It was merely to simple for my tastes and does not REALLY allow you to make unique characters, though is does kinda' allow you to... It is more for taking a tenchi character like ryoko and playing it in the tenchi environment with tenchi, not to make up a unique character and play it in a tenchi environment with unique non-player characters. This book does however contain excelent detail on the tenchi series and the entire time line, story line, maps of tokyo, maps of tenchi's house, and tons of great pictures."
2,Forrest: The pot calling the kettle black?,"There is an overwhelming desire by people in the field to demolish anything not Darwinism.Are we not to question in science? Is Darwinism really bulletproof like Forrest and others want us to believe?I thought it profoundly interesting that Richard Dawkins should draft a review for the author. In Ben Stein's documentary ""Expelled,"" you see Dawkins openly suggesting intelligent design is a viable option for the origin of life.This text from Forrest is disappointing and void of balance."
1,"This is not science, thsi is political aganda","Typical reasoning: ""Prfessor Balabambuko is insignificant according to the opinion of prfessor Kalabambuko, therefore all his theories must be wrong"". Mixing politcs and science is ALWAYS wrong, and mixing science and politics is not what this book is about - this is what this book IS. I don't want to keep such thing on my shelf and I am returning it right now."
5,"Fantastic, well worth the money","I love to spend my time in the kitchen, but what I don't like to spend is obscene amounts of money. If I'm going to buy something I'd like to buy high quality so that I don't have to go buy it in a year or two.I kind of balked at the price - I found plenty of measuring spoon sets for a third of the cost of this stainless steel set. But after receiving it and using it, I don't regret the extra money at ALL.This set has been more than faithful to me in the time I've had it - it's dependable, I can toss it into the dishwasher with no fears and the labels won't rub off. I'm not afraid of abusing this set; it's stood up to my frantic mad dashes around the kitchen from the cookie dough to the spaghetti sauce. If your old set has worn down to nothing and you're looking for something that will stay in your kitchen longer and more faithfully than you will -- this is the set for you."
2,Serial port is slow!,"I suppose I shouldn't rate this item so low because after all, I should've known that serial ports are just plain slow. But when I hooked this up to my Garmin 60CS GPS with the broken USB port, it told me that it would take 3 hours to upload a map set. This is not good enough when I was used to being able to do it in a few minutes via the USB port. Seems crazy too because the serial port is supposed to support up to 115 baud, but I could only get mine to do 9. Not sure what is wrong, but it didn't work for me so far. I think I just need a new GPS with a working USB port."
1,Crappy!!!,I received this as a gift from a friend and it doesnt even warm up!!! Looks like an expensive piece of junk to me...It's bulky and I have no clue who to send it to to fix the thing. Grrrrr......
3,great toaster till it stopped working.,"I got this toaster as a gift last christmas, and finally took it out of the box in october after I moved. I thought it was a great gadget, being able to set up your eggs and toast and go do something else in the morning while breakfast cooks. The only drawbacks I found is that it can only poach one egg at a time, and my water left a deposit in the poaching tray after one use. I was willing to overlook these things though, cause it was much easier than cooking eggs the regular way. However, a week after I started using it, the toaster part stopped working. I could still cook an egg, but could not cook my toast along with it. I called the company, and they could not do anything about it because I didn't have a recept, as it was an 8 month old chrismas gift. This is a great gadget when it works, but if you decide to buy, keep your recept in case it stops working after the first week. I think I am not the only person this has happened to."
4,Steve Green has finally found his niche again,"I grew up on Steve Green - ""Hide 'Em in Your Heart"" and ""Find Us Faithful"" etc. etc. so honestly I was really surprised when I listened to Steve Green's newest album since it is so unlike what I remember hearing as a child. The first thing I said is ""This is Christian pop-opera"" and I'm not alone in this. The review at independantbands.com [...] compares him with Josh Groban, Sarah Brightman and Andrea Boccelli.But this is a beautiful, unique album - I'm sure I've never heard anything quite like this. The style really fits Steve Green's amazing vocal ability - I can definitely see him doing more albums in this vein.The lyrics are really poetic, scriptural & show a mature idea of the Christian life. I especially liked ""You're My God"" and ""When the Morning Comes"".I'd listen to it online first and make sure it fits your tastes but it is a GREAT buy and one I think will become a favorite in our house!"
1,MORE LEAKS!,"So disappointing... This cup has more leaks than any other sippy I've tried. I, too, was attracted by the allure of a leak proof way to keep my daughter's milk cool in the summer time so I bought this overpriced and overengineered sippy. This consistently makes a bigger mess than any other sippy we have. If I still had the packaging, I would return it in a heartbeat and I caution any of you to save your money and spend it on the playtex spill proof cups or insulated sippies."
1,foogo nogo,do not waste your money. the only thing that this product does is keep liquids cold. they leak and are extemely hard to clean
5,Gone Too Sonn,"I bought this book for a friend who had a stillborn baby. I also had a stillborn baby several years and ago and it was very helpful and comforting to me, I knew it would be the perfect gift for her. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a baby."
2,Not easy for sensitive stomachs,"Let me preface by saying, I LOVE the GreensPlus brand and I buy several of their other products- mostly the flavored powders such as Amazon Chocolate and the new Vanilla Chai. I love them, because I can easily mix them in a shake or a smoothie. Nutrition-wise I think these pills are great, but they are just too big for me and upset my stomach. The daily dose is 12 capsules and the capsules are by no means small. I find myself struggling to get them down and later I find myself burping them up for several hours. This is just me however, and I have a sensitive stomach. I love this brand, and I'm sure these pills work for most people. But if you have an easily upset stomach, I might pass on these and stick with the powders."
5,a great new band with heavy guitars and great vocals.,"Frankie Machine is an awesome new band.Their guitars are really loud and sound really awesome.The drum beats add some punk sound, and the singing is great.oh yeah the bass is good too.if you like Oleander, Foo Fighters, or Offspring this CD is for you..."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I can't wait for a sequel! This book takes normal, average people, and throws them into situations that are anything but normal. A great read for vacation, because you won't get much sleep - first from not being able to put it down, then from remembering the scenes. Not for the faint at heart!"
3,Overpriced!!!!!!!,"This is good in terms of quality, but its not THAT good. Its not really THAT soft as other reviewers have made it to be. Its a normal cotton sheet, with may be a slightly higher thread count than the ones you'd find at babies r us for $10. Definitely not worth $34 that I paid for it. After looking and using the product, a fair price would be between $15-$20 at the most."
4,It performs as described,"Overall I was satisfied with the product. I used it to remove rust and surface corrosion of a old refrigerator. It took a few more applications and longer than the recommended 15 minutes, but it removed the corrosion and performed as intended."
2,NOT LIKE IT IS HYPED TO BE!,"This used to be a great product, but after using it, It had extremely poor results. I don't know if they changed manufactures or what but I will NOT buy it again."
3,Good sweater but doesn't look like the picture.,"I have a min pin who is a little taller and larger than most (16 lbs, all muscle baby). The medium fit him well, but the color is a hideous orangey-red with a weird lighter colored (almost pink) stripe around the neck that is not shown in the picture."
1,Nice product - 0 customer support...,"I bought this bracelet by mistake after not noticing that my search for a ""garnet"" bracelet included this amethyest one. My bad, but after three emails to Silver Insanity with NO RESPONSE to my requests for exhange, I cannot recommend a company such as this. The sad part is, I really like their stuff and have ordered things in the past..."
4,Good Cymbal,It's a pretty good crash/ride cymbal. Price is pretty good. My drum teacher uses this one and he knows what good is...
4,Great watch fare price,"It's a nice watch for those who like sailing boats. Great yatch race timer, accurated compass as well as the barometer. The only negative point is the thermometer which take much time to adapt in new environments."
5,Just as I expected (great and on-time).,"The grips came in the mail in about 3 business days and held up to my expectations. I have 2 younger siblings and they love the grips (I ordered 2 because it was at an excellent bargain price!). It has been about 4 months of heavy gaming and the controllers themselves show no sign of wear & tear.If I needed to buy another grip for my controller, I'm buying it from PCMICROSTORE."
5,Very good!,Great product fits the controller perfect not to lose and not to tight easy to remove. Worth every cent. If you’re really going to critique a $3 product hard then you’re crazy
4,decent,similar to the one that I used to have. The ribs feel strange though; probably would be a lot better without them.
3,"Looks great fits great,,,but,,,","I purchased these due to the fact my controllers are rather slick and hard to grip. I put them on, which was fairly easy, but found that the covers made it even more slippery. I took them off and won't use them again."
3,Veins!!.,Honestly i had ordered this product accidentally on amazon and couldnt cancel it....so since i got it for a cheap price I jus took it ....and it actually turned out to be an OK product...it gave me a little extra energy in the gym and by the time i was finished with the bottle i noticed there was quite alot more veins than i usually havesso that was pretty cool and Im someone who has been working out for four years.
2,DOES NOT WORK MUCH AS OTHER REVIEWS SAY,"I read the reviews and was pumped on buying it 30mins after i started my dayly work out and then started feeling dizzy but keeps going energy was ""ok"" but jack3d is much better for energy the only thing was my vains pump up."
3,Doesn't really work !?,It didn't work at first ( few weeks ) but now I take the 4 pills and by the time I get to the gym ... my face is flushed ..... I am going to re up one more cycle before I pass judgement to be fair.Respectfully submitted - Peter
1,Does absolutely nothing,"I took it a myriad of different ways, an hour before, 45 minutes before, 30 minutes before etc. Never once felt a pump other than normal. Its a cheap product plain and simple, unfortunately most good supplements are going to cost you a little more coin. Invest in some quality products if you are a serious weightlifter like me cause this is just garbage."
1,Prickly Heat and elevated heart rate,"I am sorry but this product gave me prickly heat all over my body and I even had red splotches (temporarily) after using this product. I thought maybe the first time I used this, it was a fluke, so I tried it again and the same results happened. I am 100% sure it was this product that caused this. My heart rate was elavated as well. I could not get my heart rate below 110 for a very long time after working out."
5,Hulkamania,"I was skeptical of anything to help me with lifting weights. I had just joined a gym not long before looking into these. The first time i took the recommended 4 pills before working out i felt like i was on drugs. but that only happened that one time. You can feel when they start to work. its hard to explain the feeling, its kind of a tingle.... i guess.... but they definitely work. The 2nd day i used them, (note- i dont take them everyday, just when i work out) i went up like 10lbs on every machine and pushed atleast 5 or 10 more reps despite the added weight. They rock! seriously! I never noticed any other side affects at all. When i run out i will def buy these again."
5,awesome product!,"I'm taking these pills now for a week, and it gives me bigger push every day! My venes are popping out there where i didn't even know i have them!Everybody who wants to get big and look good, should give it a try!!"
5,timeless wisdom,Timeless wisdom from ancient vaishnav India. First of a sequel of three books relating the story of a man looking for Good through different ages and planetary systems before finally meeting with him.
4,Great classroom project - fun for the students,"Although the plastic tray seemed pretty lightweight and flimsy when I first opened the box, I have to say that I've really gotten my money's worth out of it. I've used this mold at least 30 or 40 times over the past year or so, and it's holding up great. I teach a summer school class on dinosaurs and fossils, and I use this kit as one of our activities to demonstrate mold/cast fossil formation. I make the plaster fossils, then give them to the children to paint and take home. They love it. I haven't actually opened the baggie of plaster that came with the set because it's far too small for the quantity of casts that I make. I've been using plaster of paris and mixing in a little bit of powdered LaHabra stucco color (available in a variety of colors) to tint the plaster, and it really turns out nice."
2,"Brilliant idea for a plot, thriller it's not.","Two programmers invent a cunning process to develop the world's first biological computer that is capable of independent learning & problem solving. It reads like a snail lost at sea and is about as suspenseful as waiting for the kettle to boil. It doesn't even have a plot until you're 3/4s of the way through. I actually loved the concept, but was gravely disappointed by the way it limped through each chapter. Sure, technical garb is fine - but after a while you begin to wonder if something is gonna HAPPEN..."
3,Thorough but a poor reference and self-tutorial.,"I purchased this book with a strong HTML background but no other experience in web design. While the book goes in depth into the subject of ASP, it does so in an unsystematic fashion. This haphazard and at times cursory discussion of important ASP and VBScript features makes this book a poor reference manual. The lack of exercises to help reinforce what is learned makes this book a poor resource for autodidacts. Before reading this book, I recommend reading ""HTML: A Definitive Guide"" by O'Reilly and after this book I recommend the excellent ""Designing Active Server Pages"" by the same publisher."
5,Awesome Resource,This book really helped me pull together my understanding of ASP. THe author showed me what tools to use and how they would help me out. THe author went into great detail discussing all the related technologies.
3,"good book, but...","it's a good book, but there are some printing erros on the code which makes the reader confuse, and there are no errata or book resource to be found on the web (www.osborne.com). I bought this book here with a broken cd-rom, so it cost me a lot of effort to learn that book. if you want to buy this book, makes sure you don't get the broken cd-rom, because the resouce code is no where to be found on Internet. and the writer should (like other book writer) include his contact information."
3,"One Bi-Polar to Another, skip the book","Being bi-polar and have suffered through many hard years of mood swings and chronic depression,the author, who claims to have also suffered from chronic depression, fails to paint a clear picture of what it REALLY is like to experience this many times fatal disease. The content focuses too much on science and theory, and not enough on the pain and actual struggle. This book is one more to add to the mile high pile of self-help literature. I still wait to find a book by someone who has battled depression and/or mood disorders and has the strength to write about it. Someone every reader can relate to as a person, not a doctor with scientific theorys, causes, cures etc. Someone who will not portray a light at the end of every tunnel, because many times one may never live to see that light. Who needs another self-help book? Nice attempt for the early 90's."
2,Not the funky Nick I remember...,"When listening to this CD I lose track of who I'm listening to, could it be John Hiatt? Could it be Chuck E. Weiss...maybe Steve Forbert...is this a country song?I mean it's all over the place. That in and of itself is not a bad thing but I guess I expected a funkier smoother sound.There are a couple of good songs but balanced it's not."
5,Cool model,"I guess this isn't so much of a toy, as it is like a display piece. It is pretty much glass, so playing with it should either be done carefully, or with the knowledge that you might lose a fin or two.The directions were really easy to follow. Everything turned out great with little to no time. We didn't use the magnets, but those are a really neat idea for using your new sharks."
2,"Works well, but it's very loud","I used this humidifier on night one with no issues. After that, I turned it up to full mist. It was so loudthat it woke my husband and myself numerous times. We have used it several more times to see if ithad been attached improperly, but the issue continued."
2,Broke after 9 months,"I bought this last winter and now that I needed it again, I started to use it. I worked for two nights and then it stopped working. Also, it was very loud and I am a light sleeper which did not help and the red light that indicates it is on also did not help. It's disappointing because it is so cute but it was a waste of my money =( Had to throw it out."
4,Works well and easy to clean,First off - this is a semi-disposable item. The tank is extremely thin and cheaply made and I wonder how long it will last. The humidifier is easy to clean and has no 90 degree angles that are impossible to clean with a q-tip. I disinfect once a week with vinegar and otherwise replace the water in the tank daily. It's a little bit hard for my wife to align the tank properly when seating it in the base. My daughter loves the pink pig design and most importantly it does a great job of humidifying her room which is probably 14x14 or thereabouts. It's easy to change the amount of humidity. I put a little sticker on the dial so we could get the right amount each night.
3,It works but not efficient,"Pros: Cute design and easy to feed with 1 gallon tank.Cons: No separate power button. Have to twist the knob each to time turning on and off and make adjustment. Output is not sufficient for a room larger than 100 sq feets. No carbon filter (i.e., better fill it with pre-filtered water).In general, it is more of a fancy looking decor than efficient humidifier."
1,two in succession quit,"Very cute, and worked like a charm for about 2 weeks. Then I had a baby and it took awhile to return it. Got a new one, has been plugged in for about a week, started flashing last night, which means it is humidifying when the light flashes on, and not when off. Am returning second unit too, will choose a different brand."
2,Too Small,"While this pan might be good for a younger ferret, it's much to small for any of my full- grown ferrets toget all 4 feet into.The hooks do not work with my cage, so my ferrets just push it around.Even though these are cheaper, I'll stick with square lock- on pans."
2,a lot of rom to improve,I suppose this is a product that can be improved in many area:1. User interface - not easy at all for a techie2. Background noise can be cancelled (microphone seems okay to capture the show)3. The recording part from other media should be improved. (Should have a linein for microphone for computer synthesized music)
3,Good for what it does,"I have very simple needs; a high quality voice recorder from which to make CDs. And, if I happen to encounter a circumstance where I need more than one track, that's nice to have as well.I agree with other reviewers that the manual is written in a style that requires some specialized knowledge. But, otherwise it's quite straightforward, and if you don't understand the terminology it's probably irrelevant to what you're really doing with the recorder."
4,Good Quality Mic,"Its a good interface for recording to a computer... I high quality mic, XLR, and 1/4 stereo jacks go USB to computer... The controls on this are a bit cramped making actual emitting on it a bit tricky"
5,6 STARS!!,"I can't tell you how much time I'm going to save with this in the wedding biz!! This product works awesome and I wish I had it 3 years ago when I started! I only use it for a clip on mic on the grooms at weddings, but the sound quality is top notch, easy to use and syncs with the computer and puts all the recorded files into .wav format so I can just drop it into my production in post. If your an event videographer, you need this. Also, on-board mic at the top of the unit pics up the tiniest sound clearly and no noise disruption while recording. You NEED a 2 GB card though. Easily records over 3 hours. The card it comes with will barely do 15 minutes."
4,Zoom H4,so i just bought one of these little babies. i'd got it to replace the iTalk Pro which is a rubbish piece of kit and constantly skips when it records. yeah i know it's only 50 bucks but that doesn't excuse it from working..so in a nutshell the Zoom is built like it came out of a christmas-cracker - the screen is pathetic and the entire control intereface is poorly designed to say the least.that said is does a lot for the money and it does it well.i use it for band recordings and it's 4-track features.the sound quality is very high and it's quick and easy to record.due to the poorly designed controls changing other settings is more of a chore but you get used to it.at the moment i don't think there's really any competition for this particular beast and so if you likewhat it can do you may have to bite the bullet and put up with it's little idiosynchrasies..yo
5,"Great Sound Quality, And That's Just The Beginning...","I bought this product as an upgrade to my archaic handheld tape recorder, and I have to admit that after three weeks of using the Zoom H4 I have not been disappointed. Live shows, spontaneous jam sessions, or simple scratch tracks playing on an acoustic guitar all sound great, and I haven't even started to play around with the 4-track features. It really captures the room sound nicely, and this can be fully utilized at the proper level settings.If I have any complaint at all, it's more of the same gripes that others bring up: the interface could be slightly more intuitive, and they could have designed it so that it would be easier to pop out the memory card, where you don't run the risk of potentially damaging it. Still, with the amount of things this product is capable of doing, and at the price it's currently selling for, it can't be beat."
4,good digital recorder,"Very nice (good sounding mic preamps), and it does the job. And the price is terrific. The only thing I would change is aspects of the interface -- having to toggle the little switch-thingy around to set input levels (for example) is tricky; not being able to set levels for both channels simultaneously, stuff like that. But all things considered I'm very pleased with the product."
1,Price is way too high!,Check out the price on their website for 6 ounces and then you tell me if this 1oz size is a deal. They claim it is 70% off here? I really doubt that.
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book. It is interesting from beginning to end, does not disappoint, and is unpredictable. It is a great fantasy story. As a parent, I would hesitate to give it to younger teens because it contains some sexually explicit scenes. However, I would recommend it for mature teens.Born half human and half centaur, Elphame is the daughter of the goddess incarnate. Feeling like an outcast most of her life, she leaves her home to find her destiny in her clan's ancestral castle. When she arrives, she finds the peace, acceptance, and love she has always wanted. However, life gets complicated when she is forced to make decisions that will affect her people and her life mate (who happens to be a demon."
3,Made the Grade: Elphame's Choice [Young Adult Parthalon Book] by P. C. Cast,"3.5 out of 5 stars! I really enjoyed this story!!! I loved the new characters, the mixed races, and the love interests!! *hehee* Plus, the secondary story about her brother wasn't bad either. However, I'm not that big of fan about the ending. For one thing, I would have liked to have read an epilogue since it kind of leaves everything that is happening between them up to your imagination. And for another thing, I really wish the people who died didn't since I liked them, however I think I have an inkling of what will happen inBrighid's Quest (Harlequin Teen)because of the events that happened in this book and because I wanted them to get together more so then the two that did in this book. *sigh* Sorry to be confusing but I can't really explain it any better without giving the story away ... so you'll just have to read it! =0)Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser on my blog)"
5,Another favorite from PC Cast!,"I love every book in the Partholon series, and this book was terrific. Can't wait for the next in the series!"
5,Walden and Deja Views,These two CDs are really beautiful music. We put them on our 5-disc player in our bed & breakfast and they've never come off! We rotate the other 3! We purchased one for an associate to play at their establishment.
5,Great Introduction to Crafts,"This book has fun and creative craft projects for kids. There are step-by-step, easy to follow directions with pictures at every step. Rather than having photos, all the pictures are drawn with what looks like colored pencils. I think the best project is the Japanese Doll Bookmark, but examples of some other projects are how to make a paper butterfly, how to make a box out of a card, a glow lamp out of a jar and paper, and shadow puppets. The only potential drawback to the book is that the projects are mostly geared for girls. However, overall, I think it is a great book for kids."
5,Glad I found this,"I boughtTomy Gearation(the original set) over the winter, and have been searching for this add-on unit. My son (4) and his sister (2) each plays with the original set (11 gear + board) together or on their own. When my nieces visit (ages 5, 7), they also love to play with the set, so I expect my kids will be keeping this toy for a while. Nothing broken to date. The gears are sturdy and well made.For this add-on set, I did not need to add a C battery as stated in the product description. The gears fit to the Tomy Gearation board if you already have the original set - or I suppose can go on the frig since the backs are magnets just like the gears in the original set."
2,Does not work on lawn mower blade,I wanted this to sharpen my lawn mover blade but it doesn't work on that blade. The slot on the sharpener is not deep or wide enough. I have the Accu Sharp product for knives and that works great.
2,Specifications are wrong!,"Accu Sharp 060 GardenSharp Tool SharpenerThis is not as represented in the specifications. I was looking for something a little bigger and heavier duty than my Accu-Sharp kitchen knife sharpener. The specs said this was 9 inches long (as opposed to the kitchen 001 model I already own that is 5.5 inches long). So I thought it would be more appropriate for garden tools. When it arrived it was the exact same size, namely, 5.5 inches. Apparently I was a little too tired from yard work because I opened the blister pack and didn't realize until I had it in my hand that is was the same size as what I had. So now I have identical sharpeners."
1,Not really great for large tools,"I was hoping this would work on a spade, shovel, etc. just like they show in the picture. It ONLY works on thin blades. NO WAY will this put an edge on a large tool. It did sharpen small pruning shears and a chisel, both with pretty thin/decent edges. I would not recommend unless you need for small hand tools."
5,Best Sharpener I Have Owned,"For ease of use and speed to get a knife sharp, this is the best little gadget I have ever used. First tried it on a medium quality chef's knife. Took only 4 strokes to get a really dull knife sharp enough to slice paper with ease. It may take more strokes on a really hard, good quality steel knife, but I don't know because the only really good knife I have does not need sharpening yet."
5,Only knife sharpener you need!,"I ordered the Accu Sharp 060 to sharpen my pruning shears, loppers, etc. and discovered it works equally well for my kitchen knives. I have paid a LOT of money over the years for knife sharpeners and have now put them all away. The Accu Sharp is so easy to use and sharpens so well you don't need anything else."
1,Debbie Lives!,"When I ordered this DVD I made a huge mistake. I thought it was the actual movie, not some documentary. Don't buy it if you think you'll be seeing Debbie in action!"
5,An absolute must for M1 carbine owners - still in print and only $32,"The information and illustrations in this book are top notch. This book has some of the most complete information on maintaining the M1 carbine found anywhere. You will not regret owning this book.IMPORTANT NOTE!!! Like the all the other books in the Kuhnhausen series of shop manuals, this book is still in print by by the original publisher Heritage Gun Books and they are sold at reasonable prices from $29 to $45 each depending on the book.Do not be ripped off by scammers selling the books as rare or out of print!"
1,Do not spend your money here!,"I purchased this DVD to use as part of a lesson on cave paintings for kindergarten students and have to say this should never have been published as anything other than a board book. What a disappointment! The publishers missed a great opportunity to really embrace the significance of this discovery, the art, and the cavemen in a format that would interest the young viewer. There might be 60 seconds out of the 8 minute DVD that even talks about the art. There really isn't much content of any value on the DVD at all. Illustrations are cute - but nothing about this DVD is worth almost $30."
3,Only region a,"I would love to be able to review the actual product (Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Part 3 [Blu-ray]), but sadly am unable to because of the production company's sudden and inexplicable decision to lock the disk as region a, rather than the previous two season's a/b region formatting.So, a friendly warning to all those with players unable to use region a dvds; this product will not work for you.(Note: I'll give this a neutral star rating because I have to give it a rating by default, and it's the closest I can get to reflecting my position)."
2,"Not very substantial, and came damaged","These bean bags are very flimsy, and they don't sit in your hand like a nice sack of beans should. There are not very many beans inside them. In addition, one of the bags had a hole in it right out of the bag. I know they are cheap, which might make them a tempting buy, but I would really spend more to get a good, solid bean bag that is well-sewn - or just make your own."
4,Decent beanbags,"A little pricey but good enough quality. I like the hidden seam type if that matters to you, but these were available for free shipping and arrived on time."
5,The best toy!!!,"My son received Music Blocks as a gift when he was only 3 months old. Even then, he loved to listen to the music and would smile when it came on. He's a year old now and he still loves it! It's extremely durable--my son has not been gentle with it at all. It's taken many beatings. Also, even with the frequent use it gets, I have not had to change the batteries once in 9 months.We now have 2 additional cartridges for it (Sounds of the Orchestra, and Disney's Winnie the Pooh), neither of which have disappointed us. Even my niece and nephew (7 and 5 years old) love this toy.I highly recommend this--kids of all ages will enjoy it, and it's even fun for mom and dad!"
4,Great learning toy,I recently purchased this for my three year old. I also bought Disney's Cinderella cartridge. She loves to arrange and rearrange the blocks listening to what she created. She's always very proud of what she has created. It's also a great activity for us to do together. I leave it out all the time in a safe place away from her drooling one year old brother and she stops and plays with it constantly. A bit pricey but worth the money
4,Fun but cartride placement could be better,"This is an interesting and educational toy. I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in. That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes. If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I fell into the hype behind this toy and bought it for my 3 yr. old boy. What a mistake! I don't see how my child is supposed to develop intellectually by listening to the same 2 secs. of music repeatedly. Also, the volume, even when set on the ""Low"" setting, is much too loud. The first time my child pressed the block my wife and I were surprised to see the startled look on his face due to the extremely loud volume. My son soon became bored with the toy and now only uses the blocks as ... building blocks, and the red one has started to crack! Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,WHAT A GREAT GIFT!,"I recently received Neurosmith's Music Blocks as a gift for my 2 year old daughter, along with both the Rhythms of the World and Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridges. This is by far THE BEST GIFT that we have received! She immediately began switching the blocks around, and then pushing the big blue button to hear the blocks play in sequence. She loves carrying this thing throughout the house, showing off her new compositions. Although she is quite an active 2 year old, this product keeps her busy for hours at a time. Her favorite cartridge seems to be the Jazz cartridge, while my favorite is Rhythms of the World. In just a matter of weeks, numerous neighbors have witnessed this toy and about five have already ordered it for their children! This is a very durable, creative, and stimulating toy, and I recommend it for any parent, relative, or teacher."
3,Interesting,"Book was ok, I got to learn about the various possibilites that the nursing profession has to offer... same info i could've proably found out online. Wasnt too impressed."
2,"A quick, but forgettable read","While this book is somewhat entertaining, it is also extremely predictable. If I could go back in time, I would not have spent the money."
2,"Out of date, get somthing more current.","Am using the 07 version to make current reservations for a 10 trip. Comparing the information I am getting from friends and the web (Infomation on ATMs, Hotels), is out of date. I would recommned getting either a more current book or plan on using the web to gather information which needs to be more current."
5,Excellent Learning Tool,"I bought this for my son because he just loves Bear in the Big Blue House. Since he is so fascinated with Bear, I bought this video to help him learn his shapes and colors. He is only 1 1/2 but learns quick. Great DVD to help children learn."
5,Fascinating,"This is one of the most fascinating toys I've ever seen - and my 3 year old grandson thinks so too. It is mesmerizing. I purchased it for use when my grandson was travelling a lot, but it was too noisy for that. Great for those moments when you want more restful play"
1,ILLEGAL amounts of lead (Pb) in toy,"The non profit organization Healthy Stuff has a website that provides chemical information about toys. They tested this toy and found high levels of lead and bromine in the magnets and in the black board, making this toy a health hazard to children. This also makes the toy illegal in the USA.Amazon should NOT sell this toy!"
3,Never got the attention we thought it would,"My parents purchased this as a toy to have at their house when my daughter visited. We had high expectations, it looked like it would be a awesome toy.She was a little over 2 when they got it. She couldn't put it together herself but would enjoy doing it with grandma and would laugh at it but it never really got her attention. She'd play with it when we did but not otherwise. We thought as she got older, it would get more use but that never happen. Once she was around 3 1/2 - 4 she could use it by herself but again it just didn't keep her attention. She loves puzzles and other games where she builds or puts things together so not sure why this didn't keep her attention but it doesn't.My parents have had this toy for around 2 years now and it still works fine - we haven't had some of the issues other reviewers have had but it didn't get used a ton either."
2,No Durability,"The refrigerator looks great, but it is less then 6 years old and it is dead. The unit worked fine for the first 5.5 years, but about a month ago stopped cooling. The factory certified technician was out today and said buy a new one. He said somewhere in the system there is a leak or the compressor is too weak and it will cost more to find and fix it then to buy a new one. I then called Marvel where the customer service rep said that he typically sees people replacing these at 5 years (just past the warrenty). He agreed with the service guy that it will be very expensive to fix. The MSRP is $1400. Now I didn't pay $1400, but I still think a $1K refrigerator should last longer then 6 Years."
3,its fine,"Most bras feel substantial in some ways. I have purchased Calvin Klein before, so I am not sure why this one is very light weight. It does fit and is easy to wear."
2,Kindle Edition is not recommended,"The Kindle edition is not worth the price. There is no CD(obviously) and the promissed web site where you can download parts of the CD and ""learning tools"" is more than lacking...I found no learning tools etc.The illustrations in the Kindle edition are too small to be of any use.Perhaps the print edition is OK, but not the Kindle edition."
4,where is the cd??,The book has been very helpful. I have been playing the harp for some time now and picked this book up for some additional guidance. It has been good. The only thing is that I purchased it for my kindle and I'm not sure where the included Cd is?? If any one knows please let me know.
2,a book for novices,"I was looking for a book that would provide detailed, in-depth information. I did not find what I was looking for here.It has helpful information if you are completely new to the industry. If you have ANY experience couples with some common sense, then this is not what you're looking for.It did have a resources guide in the back that I found helpful, but that's about it."
4,Good read,"I found this book to be a great read. Very well-written, easy to read-nice and to the point. I really liked the real life examples they reference in the book. They have real life stories of personal trainers and how they started out in the industry. The book gives a great side by side comparison of a personal trainer starting their own studio vs. a trainer starting out with an in-home business. The only thing keeping this from a 5, in my opinion, is they don't really do into detail about the ""next step."" For example, you need to obtain a business license, permit etc., but they do not go into any details. But there are other books out there for this. I would also recommened reading Personal Training for Dummies, they go into great detail about how to really launch your business, and what exactly you will need."
4,Exactly what is says it is,"A nice little 45 minute read on all the basics of a personal trainer business. Certainly not your guide to writing your business plan BUT it does pretend to be. A very good overview of the pieces that need to come together. A good readJohn Gregory Vincent[...]The ""CURE"" for the Common Workplace"
1,non-working CD-RW drive,"Although the purchase and delivery process went smoothly, the product didn't work on either of my two Macs, or on a friend's PC. Among other things, the pins on the computer end of the power supply bent like feathers. But even absent that, the drive simply wouldn't load. I contacted Iomega (a hassle), and was authorized to return it, but was warned to return only those parts that needed fixing, as nothing else would be sent back. By the time the replacement came, I had mislaid the CD with the drivers on it. Now I have to go back to Iomega (only specified hours; only on weekdays) and try to get a replacement CD. The drive is also large and loud. All in all, I'm sorry I ever ordered it."
1,HORRIBLE product,"I paid $75, plus more for tax, for what I feel is a piece of junk that will not even burn CDs. Yes I bought the Iomega CD-RW. I expected to get something I can plug in and use just like any other CD-RW. You know, go under windows ""My Computer"", click on music or whatever, and copy to the CD rewrite. Ohhh no, it won't do that. It won't even recognize the CD disc in it!--and yes my computer recognizes the actual drive, so it's no configuration problem.Maybe I'm supposed to use the aweful software packaged in it? No, that's not right--I want an external CD-RW, and using standard windows commands should be able to copy to disc. And yes I did send it to the correct drive--I KNOW how to use external drives because I have an external DVD reader/writer on my other computer, and it behaves like it should. This one won't. I'm 100% angry about this, and taking it back for a full refund tomorrow. I think this is a piece of junk. Thank you very much Iomega for wasting my time."
3,A Bit Small,"This is a very small tie clip, only works with skinny ties. Color is a very light gold. (almost silver)."
2,Creepy inherited house take 1 - 2 - 3,"So most of these tales were just okay with the highlight being -The Fisherman of Falcon Point- which as you may have guessed has to do with good ole Dagon and fishy people. In -Witch's Hollow- no one dies or goes insane which was kind of strange for a Lovecraft story. The worst thing about this collection is that 3 of the 6 stories are of the well-tread Lovecraftian ""relative-from-europe-comes-to-america-to-collect-his-inheritance-in-the-form-of-an-old-house"" variety. This leads me to believe that there was a reason that Lovecraft didn't finish these fragments and that they should have just been left to die (or go insane)."
2,Saccharine,"As one of Ben's biggest fans, I so looked forward to this book. How did it feel to have so much adulation so young, the frustration of his many near misses, his personal ups and downs, and insights into his peers ?Sadly, this book conveyed none of the above, and, frankly, told me little more about Ben than I already knew. A wasted opportunity."
2,Difficult Reading,"As a Christian homeschooler who teaches advanced theories of origin I would not recommend this book. There is good science here, particularly in the original theory on Neanderthal Man, but the overall presentation of the book is technical, disjointed, and sometimes pedantic. The author makes an interesting case that there is a scattered evolution Establishment that suppresses important data, but the attempt to make his professional work a personal drama is overblown. He also makes the mistake of falling into sarcasm and ridicule when discussing his detractors. This book would be better if the theory and its supporting data were more organized and crisply presented and the dramatics left to the margins."
3,"Interesting, if Outdated theory....","I found this book to be both interesting and amusing. The author relates his tales of research as if they were scenes from a James Bond film. Also, the DNA research shows that Neanderthals are not directly genetically related to Homo Sapien Sapien. The book, however, is entertaining reading for themost part... It bogs down a little near the end but can be muddled through. All-in-all a good read."
1,Review of the Reviewers,"I have not read this book, nor do I intend to. I have read the reviews, and it appears that someone is trying to mess with us. Notice that the pro-Cuozzo reviews are highly recommended by 8 out of 9 readers (example), and the con-Cuozzo reviews are disdained in the same proportions. Doesn't seem too likely. Is there an anti-evolutionist stacking the deck out there????? You heard it here first."
4,Super value,"The color doesn't look like the picture, the real color is much darker, but still super value..."
5,Lark Rise to Candleford,"Loved all the different storylines, couldn't wait to see how they were resolved. Sorry when Larkrise to Candleford was over.."
5,Very entertaining,When it come to well rounded entertainment the British seem to know how to do it best. A great show and acting. This is a show you and your children can watch.
5,Very entertaining!,"Love this series! Funny, serious and delightfully entertaining!! The cast is spot on!! Enjoy all the scenery and story plots."
4,Decent,Its a clean show. Its so much better than watching the reality crap. I can watch it w/my kids running around. I don't have to worry about them being subjected to certain content.
5,Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One,This product came in a very timely manner and in excellent condition. I must admit I haven't viewed it yet because I'm saving it to watch with my daughter in June. I look forward to seeing it with her at that time. I saw some of the episodes on PBS and was so impressed that I wanted to have all of the episodes.
5,Awesome show,"I love it. I love BBC anything, but this show is fantastic. Wholesome-something we don't have in shows nowadays. Wish there were more seasons."
5,One Of The Best Albums of Austin's Career !,"Ever since I heard Patti sing in the early 80's doing vocals for Quincy Jones' projects or backing vocals for Michael Jackson or duetting with James Ingram I have always heard more than a singer; I have always heard a true, genuine songbird ! Her musical and vocal versatility is priceless in this day and age. For Ella is the proof of this ! Austin's vocals are smooth as satin without ever being pompous or bombastic. However, from a gentle whisper she can surely soar like an eagle in the upper vocal range and scat like there's no tomorrow. Her experience in the music business and sheer artistry come to astronomical proportions with this beautiful big band production aimed at honoring the late great Ella Fitzgerald. For Ella should be a permanent keeper in anyone's music collection !"
5,What everybody here said..and more!,"After just three hearings on a headset at work, I'm already thinking we've got a desert island disc here.More than five stars? No question. Everything works here, splendidly.The killer cut is, as has already been stated, ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"" in a performance of one of Ella's great signature pieces that, heresy of heresies, actually outburns the original and will have you stompin' and laughing for joy.I've always liked Austin from her Quincy Jones and James Ingram days, but this recording is a revelation. I can only hope there's more to come!"
4,good toy,"my 10 year old daughter really enjoyed this, it kept her busy for a long time,we really recommend it"
2,"Cute activity, Cheap quality","This is a fun activity to do with a child, but honestly, it is cheap quality and not that asthetically pleasing. It is a great fine motor promoting activity - i actually bought it for my 12 yr old and realized that that it really was more appropriate for my 3 yr old. Rachael loves her ""pretty things"" and it is fun. Glue sticks well too."
3,Not sure yet,I have taken for four weeks and noticed nothing. Dr Oz did say it takes at least 6 weeks. So I willContinue to take it.
4,Great Buy,My bunny likes her new litter box. Great size for a smaller bunny as she can fit all the way in. Smaller pans seemed to be difficult for her to tell when she was hanging in or out of the pan this one is great.
4,Adorable addition to the Mlynowski collection!,"I'm a die-hard Sarah fan, and this book lived up to my (rather high) standards! The characters are real without being boring, the problems they face (both alone and with each other) are real enough to relate to, and the way she threads these four characters together is fabulous. Not her best (which, to me, is a toss-up between Milkrun and As Seen On TV), but definately one to add to your ""to read/to own"" list"" if you enjoy her style.Can't wait for her next!"
3,A Bit Dramatic but Decent,Bettina Gregory hosts this series. It is fairly good for illustrating bipolar disorder to students and as a psychoeducation tool for families. She is melodramatic at times and tries way to hard to get the obvious point across. This is a fairly decent DVD for the price.
4,Thermos does just what I want it to do.,"I wanted a thermos to fit inside the larger size LLBean lunch box. I wanted it to hold enough food for a 10 year old boy with a hearty appetite. I wanted it to have a wide enough mouth to make eating out of it easy. I wanted it to keep foods warm for several hours. I wanted it to be durable.This cute little thing does just what I want it to do. Prior to getting this thermos, I packed cold lunches for my 5th grader everyday. Now I can send pasta, casserole, soups.... I pack his lunch between 6 and 7am; lunch is at Noon. And he tells me his food is ""really warm and yummy."" Worth the 14 bucks for the variety and interest it adds to my growing boy's lunch."
1,Bummed - totally did not work,"After all the great reviews I was surprised and disappointed that this did not work. I purchased two and tested them both after my daughter said her food wasn't warm at lunch. I DID follow the instructions (boiling water in there for 10 min with the lid on, dumped out and quickly put in hot food) and after a 4-hour test, in both canisters, the food was perfectly cold. I didn't get a replacement - I had two already that didn't work, what are the chances that another would?The size, shape and color of this was absolutely perfect, which is why I was even more bummed. Back to the drawing board to find something that works..."
5,Works Great!,"So far this has been a great product, my daughter reported that her lunch was still steaming not just warm! Hopefully it maintains this and doesn't quit as it gets older."
1,Disappointed,"i bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. He is an extremeely picky eater and does not like most of the food offered at his kindergarten school. I have followed the directions to a ""T"", leaving boiling hot water in the thermos up to almost 15 minutes, then heating up his food and immediately placing it in the thermos. This is at 7:45 in the morning and he eats lunch at 11:30, so it's not even 4 hours...he says the food is cold every time. i really need to find a thermos that does the job."
4,"Worked well, food stayed warm","As far as I can tell,this product works well. I decided to purchase this brand over a Pottery Barn item after reading terrible reviews about it (it leaked, it didn't keep food warm) and reading good reviews for this product. It lived up to my expectations."
2,Thermos Foogo,"This is good as in it does not leak. However, the food turns cold quickly. It doesn't seems to be able to keep the food warm for long. maybe an hour only?"
1,Extremely difficult to open,"I used this thermos for a few days and I will be returning it. I use it overnight to cook oatmeal and every morning there's a struggle to open the lid. I had to ask my husband several times to unscrew the top, it's that tight! Not sure what I've been doing wrong, after the first few times I made sure not to close it too tight - to no avail. I guess it's the vacuum - the lid is practically sucked in. Plus, the upper rubbery band is slippery and the bottom rubbery band is twisting. What a nightmare. I cannot imagine any kid being able to open it."
2,Sent the wrong color,"I guess whoever was packing is a colorblind. I have ordered blue and the invoice which was included said blue, but the item is pink!"
5,"Pricey, but worth it","OK, I'm not sure why this thing had to cost almost $20, but we have certainly gotten $20 worth of use out of it in just the last couple of months. Excellent for soups, rice dishes, pasta dishes... It has really perked up my kids' interest in lunch and helps us to get through leftovers faster! They have lunch about 5 hours after I pack it and they both say that their food is still warm. I love this thing."
2,Not very warm,I purchased it to keep hot water in for warming baby's bottle when out. Its the perfect size for 120ml of milk but I found that it didn't really keep water hot enough.
3,Keeps food warm; hard to open,"I've used this item for a couple of weeks; pretty satisfied except it can be hard to open, and I'm an adult. I put the food in it at around 6:30 am; it's now almost 12:30 pm. It's still warm, not hot and it was HOT when it went in. I reheat the container and keep it in a separate lunch bag to transport--not with the cold stuff. Today it was VERY HARD to open; maybe I tightened it more than necessary."
5,Excellent,"The food jar does keep food warm well, its easy to take around and just so convenient to use.My daughter loves it."
4,"Good thermos overall, better with cold beverages","This is a good compact thermos. It does not hold the hot food's temperature as well as I was hoping for, but still keeps it warm enough for your child. Does a better job with cold foods. It is a great product since you can use it for both - hot and cold foods/beverages. It is very easy to clean and compact for the amount of food you can place inside. I would recommend this product."
1,Not what you would expect,This may just be me but this product did not work as well as the King thermos. I thought that this thermos would be a great fit for my sons box but it constantly leaked everywhere.
5,Foogo,"I bought this iteam to pack my daughter a warm meal for her lunch in grade school. She is such a pickey eater so we pack every day. That can become some what of a hassel since you can only pack so much cold food. I have tried many different theremos. Then i purchased this one. Before I store the hot food in the Foogo i heat it with boiling water for about 15 minutes to my suprise the food in the Foogo is still warm when my daughter gets home from school.To help you understand how great of a product this is my daughter leaves for school at 7:30 a.m. and gets home at 4:30 p.m. GREAT, Great, Product i recommened this to everyone when they ask what i use"
1,No good,"These headphones are the worst. The only redeeming quality is that they retract. Otherwise, the cord is super thin, very short, and the sound quality is terrible! Also, they broke apart very soon after I got them just from being in my purse. Don't waste your money."
2,"Great idea, but implementation is lacking . . .","Since I'm always getting my earbuds tangled up, I really wanted a retractable that was compact, fully willing to give up some sound quality for the convenience. Although I think the design is great (and I really don't have a problem with having to retract/open both the plug and earbuds at the same time unlike a previous reviewer) the problem is that they are way too short. Previous reviewers also noted they were short, but given I'm only 5'1"" I figured that would actually be perfect for me. Wrong. Even for me, with the cords fully extended, when I put my MP3 in my pants pocket, it kept tugging at the ears until finally I had to take the player out and carry it in my hand. I'll probably still use them for when I'm just sitting and listening but won't use them at all for walking."
3,Separate pieces might be better,"Although my 2 year old really likes to play with this, I think she'd be more engaged with it if there was more 'counter' space. Other than shuttling things from oven to microwave to sink, there isn't much room to 'pretend' cook (chop, stir, etc.). Also, although extremely durable, the oven door doesn't close quite right, and the phone sits pretty high and is hard to reach.I find myself wondering if I would have been better off buying separate pieces for her."
2,Be prepared for extra work!,"I'm not sure if Little Tikes has reduced their quality control measures but this is the second toy we've purchased that didn't assemble properly.Holes were missing from the panels that secure to the back of the shelving units. I had to punch them out with a screw driver in order to assemble the panels. When the phone unit didn't attach correctly, I notified Little Tikes. They said that the problem was common and recommended I increase the size of the holes. It didn't work and we've since tossed the phone and it's cradle. Little Tikes offered to replace the unit but that would have meant another assembly. We chose not to take our chances! Purchase at your own risk!"
3,"Not bad, but too easy","I remember playing on a version of this game in my youth, so I bought this one for my kids. It's just like the one I remember (still fun), but after some practice, it becomes too easy. My entire family can now ""whack the back"" pretty loudly, before letting the ball roll forward into the farthest hole."
5,Love the Bears flag.,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and her husband. I love the design and quality. The price was great too.
4,LOVE THIS HAT BUT MADE FOR A GUY..TOO BIG,"I LOVE THIS HAT, TOO BIG FOR WOMEN BUT I WILL ADJUST WITH A SWEATBAND. PERFECT FOR MY BUNCO PARTY."
2,Mostly unlistenable,"First, not only am I a big Replacements fan, but I've also bought and loved every Westerberg record up to this one. Sadly, though, these two records have to be couple of the blandest albums I've ever heard in my life. No hooks, no clever lyrics, just a lot of aimless guitar strumming and Paul mumbling into the mike. Not actually bad, but definitely boring and inchoate.The first album is pretty much a wash-out, with only ""No Place for You"" showing any glimmer of promise for a live show. The Grandpaboy disc, relatively speaking, is better. There are some tunes I can actually listen to and ""Eyes Like Sparks"" is actually pretty good, in a mid-period Rolling Stones sort of way. Still, I wouldn't recommend buying this record to anyone who isn't already a fan."
3,From Back Cover,"Judge Laurel Patrick blamed it on the lush island paradise of St. Thomas. Why else would she make love to a virtual stranger? Laurel wanted Sean Gannon as much as he wanted her. The chemistry was irresistably powerful, their passion intense. Then reality unexpectedly intruded in Laurel, forcing her to leave the island - without a chance to explain to Sean... or say goodbuy.Sean's gut instinct as a U.S. marshal is telling him something isn't right. Once back in the States, he confronts Laurel - and sees the hunted look in her eyes, the fear she can't hide. Sean ignores Laurel's attemptes to protect him by pushing him away. The woman he loves is in danger, and he isn't going anywhere...[2nd in the American Heroes series; follow-up to Men of Courage.]"
2,First time reader of Graham...not impressed,"This is the first book that I've read of Heather Graham, and I can't say I was impressed. The story itself was alright, but her style of writing was enough to make me want to stop reading the book. Her use of exclamation points was driving me insane!!!!I'll try another book, but if it's anything like this one, it will be my last."
2,Don't Bother,"Ms. Graham is usually a great author but this one was weak and very lame. The reltionship didn't really develop beyond ... and them *BAM* he loves her and suddenly not only believes in ghosts but has talked to Josh!? Also, the ""mystery"" was solved in such a predictable way. It was a chore to finish this one."
4,interesting book,This author has kept my attention and it is hard to laid it down. It always has another exciting moment coming and flows well. Good read
3,"An enjoyable ""sixth sense"" read!","I enjoyed the change of pace that Ms. Graham gave me with Haunted. The characters were built up well and the ""sixth sense"" element made for an interesting read."
5,Heaather Gramham's Haunted,"Intrigueing from the first page. Always looking forward to what will happen next. Romantic,and well written supense. Good fun reading."
3,Sufficient,"This is an OK guidebook for information about culture and hotels. I found that it covered all the basics. It covers all of the island nations in the Micronesia area. The section on Palau and Yap were particularly useful to me. However, I thought that there wasn't enough information about scuba diving. Most of the people visiting this region are interested in scuba diving. There isn't enough information on dive shops or dive sites. In fact, there aren't any maps of dive sites at all. If you're going to go diving, I would try another guidebook. If you're just going to go sightseeing, this is just fine. Also another thing I would like to see in the next edition is a few more photos. Sometimes photos can help you decide whether to go to a place or not. With more photos, I think this guidebook would attract more people to these lovely islands."
2,Does not dissolve,"This vitamin C powder does not dissolve as well as other products I have used, it mainly leaves a gritty substance on the bottom. I would not recommend it."
5,Essential for every SFO member,"Fr. Benet has provided the essential prayers and ceremonies for the life of a fraternity, complete with a brief yet complete set of appropriate Scripture readings and excerpts from the writings of St. Francis. Contains the rituals for: reception of Inquirers and Candidates, Professions, Establisment of a Fraternity, Visitations, and routine meetings of the council. Every SFO should have his/her own copy."
3,"Like the product, but I have had one fail","This attenuator has been very helpful in our operation to take various levels, including line level, down to a useful level for our recorders. One out of ten has failed for us. I would like to see a bypass position on these so that a person could have it inline and drop quickly down to various levels if needed. This would be much faster for real-life situations like press conferences from house feeds or pool audio."
1,Poorly Designed Toy,"I thought that this might be a cool ""water gun"" because it reminded me of the old school water weenies idea with surgical tubing.I was very disapointed in the first time we used it, even with me supervising my son, that the plastic cap on the end of the latex tube litterally shattered into pieces. The pressure relief valve failed to work and it is difficult to tell when it is full.It could have been a lot of fun, but I've realized why Amazon/Toys R Us have it on sale for half off. Even at that it's still not worth [...]"
4,Splendid!,"It gives an objective perspective of the ""other side of the story"" - as each and every real-life drama has. We are used to see Diana's saga from her perspective - this film gives you a background of Charles'pains, tribulations, and his own unfulfilled love."
1,waste of time & $,"Listen this is not worth seeing, all the glitz glam and his name Mike Epps attracts your attn.but what a let down"
3,Fill- in Bible puzzle book,"I was disappointed with the quality.and workmanship of this book. Th puzzles looked like they were printed out from a very old printer! The words were sometimes hard to tell what they were. Looked like a very old printer. There were also a few mistakes in the spelling. The puzzles were also printed on one side of the paper, so there were blank pages on the back of each page! Instead of 50 puzzles, there should be 100. The quizzes were totally different. They were printed on a different printer. Very legible and easy to do. I would have returned it except I had started to do the puzzles before I figured out how bad this book really was. I would not recommend this book to any one."
4,We liked it,"My 7 year old is a big fan of ""Spaghetti and Meatballs for All"" by the same author. We liked it, but I'm I'm not sure whether it'll become a favorite."
1,Serious lack of useful information in this book,"Buying and reading this book was a mistake. The author is obviously just a book writer and knows nothing about the home inspection service! That was clearly evident since I am a home inspector and there was nothing any novice inspector could learn from this book that they wouldn't already know. If you want to learn about home inspections then you have to buy a book written by an expert in that field - a home inpsector with many years of experience - not an author that writes books on random topics! There are other books that are far superior to this book. My recommendation is don't buy this, spend your money on another book."
5,Catholic Homeschool Companion,This book is perfect for a first time homeschooler like me. Got me started and guided me through when I needed help.
4,Lexi's Favorite Ball,My dog loves this toy! She is a very large dog and can not chew through this. The only negative aspect is that my family thinks the squeak is annoying. It does not bother me.
5,Great Dog Toy,This is my pit bulls' favorite toy. She loves the noise that it makes and the crazy way it bounces. I would order this toy again.
5,Awesome Dog Toy!,"My dog absolutely LOVES this toy. For a dog that enjoys playing fetch and enjoys a good chew toy look no further! When you throw it, it bounces and squeaks and is really fun to play with. What I like most about it is that it is strong! My dog loves to chew on things. She has ""killed"" 3 soccer balls now but has yet to even put a hole in this one. I will warn that she did immediately chew its feet off the very first day she got it, but that does not effect the toy adversely at all. The legs do make it easier to throw, but even without them it bounces great and she seems to love it just the same. We are on her second one now since she lost the first one in the lake, but for some reason she hasn't chewed the legs off of it this time. Do note that they make them in different sizes for different sized dogs. I have the 10 inch ball. It's about the size of a softball and is a smooth, strong, rubber ball with a loud squeaker inside of it. Tons of fun...we highly recommend it!"
3,Kinda disappointed...,"I'm not sure if these come in different toughness levels, but this one did not stand up to my dogs nearly like the other one I have. On both, the feet have been ripped off VERY quickly, but this is understandable because they stick out and are an easy target. On this one though, one of my female ripped the sqeaker out within minutes. Kinda works for me because now I don't have to hear it squeak, but it's also easier to rip apart with a massive hole in it."
4,My Bernese Mountain Dog loves Good Cuz,"I have purchased several of the Good Cuz toys from Amazon. Yep...my dog chews the feet off in the first 10 minutes. And the squeeker is gone shortly thereafter (the neighbors are greatful for that). But, even without feet and a squeeker, I never see him without one of these toys in his mouth. He is a very strong dog, and every once in a while I'll find one of these toys in pieces. But for the most part, they hold up pretty well. A large Good Cuz toy will last my dog 6-8 months. They look pretty strange by the time he's finished with one, but he wouldn't do without it."
1,Choke Hazard!!!,"I purchased 2 of these, 1 for each of my shih tzus. They hardly used it, but the few times they actually did, one of the legs broke off! They played with this chew toy as directed, but the part that was gnawed off could have led to my dog choking! I threw away both toys immediately. Luckily neither of them did, but I definitely would not recommend this for small dogs."
2,5 minutes,"Our 50 lb Lab mix had the ball five minutes and the squeeker popped out into the inside of the ball. Figured she would eat the feet off but thought the squeeker would last longer than that. Might have well have gotten her seven toys from the Dollar Store, would have last longer."
2,Short Lived!!,"I bought two of these and was super excited that so many people recommended this item. Unfortunately, my 2 year old lab ripped the feet off and destroyed the toy in less than ONE hour! He is hard on toys so I guess it would be a great toy for a more gentle dog. My ten month old baby loved this toy too, so be warned if you have little ones they might want to ""play"" too."
1,Lasted 3 minutes!!!!,My dog had the squeaker out in 3 minutes! She destroyed the whole thing in 5 minutes. We just received it today and it is already in the trash.
2,Lasted about 30 minutes,"My terrier loved this for the 30 minutes it took him to completely destroy it, tearing it into little bits and eating the bits. I don't know what happened to the squeaker, I guess he ate that too."
3,feet,this is an okay ball but within a few moments of playing catch the dog had completely chewed off the feet.
2,Hard to squeeze and difficult to make squeak.,"This toy is made of very hard rubber and the difficult to squeak noise maker inside seems too large relative to the size of the toy. So it's hard to squeeze for small dogs and some people. But whatever the case, the squeaker would not consistently squeak and may have been broken out of the package. I generally like the products from this company, but not this toy. I would have returned it but for under $4 it's not worth the trouble."
4,As usual problems with freezing,I love these two guys and their clean comedy.What i don't like is the picture freezing up.My DVD players are all less than six months old and i have three of them.I realize they don't make these players like they use to.I'm asking does anyone else have this problem? It seems like every other tape i buy i have this problem.
4,Best of Abbot & Costello Vol 2,"Tired of looking for a movie that doesn't have nudity or vulgarity, or gratuitious sex scenes? Then, look to Abbott & Costello for good, clean, fun! The slapstick may be a little dated but the movies have interesting plots. Lou is the little guy who usually is taken for the patsy. Abbott often is the slicker of the two but he is often a patsy in his own way. This volume contains some of their more creative films, like THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES and LITTLE GIANT. Children enjoy the comedy and fun and adults can be transported back to the Saturday afternoons of their youth, when these films were shown on television. Maybe a whole new generation of fans can be won for Abbot & Costello."
1,Fed Up,"I was thrilled with this sofa initially , and was using it both as a bed and seating place. It was very comfortable and solid for two months, and now it's falling apart. First there was a small rip and then there was a puncture. No problem. Now it seems like every day I am waking up to find it deflated, having to find a new hole, patching it up, and waiting four hours until I can inflate it up again. I am 120 lbs and I'm not jumping on the thing. Today I leaned on my elbow and it went right through the sofa. I'm completely out of glue and out of patience."
3,"not worthy of the name ""Farinelli""","These are some of the most difficult arias written in the Baroque era, but the singing here fails to do justice to the brilliant music. If you're interested in how glorious Farinelli's singing was, try Cecilia Bartoli's ""Vivaldi Album"" and the original soundtrack of the movie ""Farinelli."" Of course, the REAL Farinelli must have been much greater, but those two CD's are the closest things we can get."
5,Heartfelt and thought provoking,"Recommend this book to all ages. The deep traditions of the sport with the life lessons presented, draw the reader in and make them a part of the story. As. Youth lacrosse coach I will be making the recommendation to all of my parent to encourage their boys to take time for this book."
3,"Not the best, but enjoyable...","The above track samples are not from this album. Amazon has this page all screwed up! This disc represents John Williams pre1989 output. It is the rarities of ""Liberty Fanfare"", music from""The Accidental Tourist"", ""The Cowboys"" overture, ""Olympic Fanfare"", ""Empire of the Sun"", and ""The Mission"" that will spark your interest. The rest of the disc comprises of more familiar selections all recorded by more noted artists. Richard Hayman spent 30yrs. arranging for Fiedler and the Boston Pops, but other than program selection, he cannot compete either in performance or recorded sound. He is best served In ""The Mission"" with its's soaring theme, heard nightly on the NBC Evening News. At least only one selection from the over played original ""Star Wars"" trilogy is included."
5,ALL of B.I.G.'s videos on 1 DVD. Must Have!!,"All of the videos made while he was alive and some rare and unseen footage. Videos that he was featured on, (Flaya in ya Ear Rmx, etc.) and so on. A Great Buy and a Great Collector Item. Rare Find."
2,Good Game Marred by Inferior Materials,"The biggest problem with this particular make of the game is that the rods used to move the ball are made of a metal that is not nearly strong enough to control the ball with any precision. As the ball starts to drop between them, instead of being able to bring the rods together and raise the ball back up, the rods are too soft and bend around the ball.Lesson learned... try before you buy."
3,It's OK.....,"At first I fell in love with this product because sometimes by side burns can get a bit dark, specially in the winter when my skin is much lighter and my hair appears to be darker...It bleaches facial hair, thats for sure, but after a couple days my hair color gets a bit darker.. and eventually you can't tell it was ever bleached."
3,brother not with brother,"This film is about a young black gay man who meets Richard Bruce Nugent, the first African-American to publish a fictional story on homosexuality. The film is pretty and a great effort for a first-time director. However, folks in the audience were furious. In this film, every black gay character has a white lover. Viewers were non-plussed by the interracial coupling, but they viewed the lack on ANY black gay couples as problematic. The movie implies that a defining trait of being black and gay is to have a white partner. In this film, blacks can be friends, pro-gay allies, or homophobes, but they never love each other romantically. This film is set in New York City where there are countless black gay male couples. This film was wrongly titled ""Brother to Brother."" It should have been called ""Black Man with White Man"" because that was the coupling which the movie focuses on and celebrates. Brother who love brothers don't exist here."
1,The worst album of KATE to date!,"The disk starts off promisingly with a well-played Overture, but once the singing commences we're in trouble. They force American accents and oversing the roles. At least they can sing...the leading man, Paul Jones cannot. It is painful to listen to him warble through the Porter classics written for a legitimate voice. His voice has no top end and no bottem end, and the middle range is pretty shakey. Is it any wonder his Act II solo reprise of ""So in Love"" was left out? Stick with Alfred Drake and the original cast."
2,"The photographs are well done, but the text is disappointing","I got the distinct impression that Ms Langley had a profound distaste for male sexuality. In certain circumstances this is perfectly understandable, but it does leave me with the impression that she should have stayed out of the sex industry. However she is a fairly good photographer and the photographs are well taken. Its an interesting peek inside the lusty lady."
5,Couldn't put this down!,"This book has a very specific audience... I don't think that it is for everyone! ...but if you've come this far then it just might be for you. It was interesting to read Erika Langley's personal text about the diverse individuals that choose to work in the alternative world of exotic dancing. What was most engrossing was that Erika crossed the line that seperated herself from the dancers, becoming an exotic dancer and not simply documenting them. Regardless if you agree with her decision, it certainly draws attention to how an outsider might perceive a situation differently than an insider and how that perception affects choices in their photography. I am a local of Seattle and certainly enjoyed learning more about this historic place of buisness. My interests in photography and feminism also influenced my enjoyment of this book"
1,Piece of JUNK,"it didn't have the right pieces and only the pieces to make one coaster even though the instructions show several different coasters, you have to buy those extra. The marbles wouldn't stay on the track, let flew off, probably because we didn't have the right pieces..big christmas morning fail!"
2,Leg Holes too Tight,"This was a little frustrating because I was really excited about the low price. I ordered the correct size (L) for my dog based on the measurements given and it fits her neck, chest and back, but was super tight around her front legs. I find this bizarre too because her legs are very thin - she is a 35lb mix and her body-type is a lot like the grey scruffy dog in the photo. She can't really wear it as it is, but I can't size up because that would be way too big. The sweater itself is really cute and seems decently made, so I'm pretty disappointed about it."
3,alright,older kids think its to young for them. young kids think it is too hard. not very impressed so far.
3,Not what I expect but I still enjoy playing with it,"I'm happy with this game, I just expected it to be less of a board game. But if you like playing CLUE, and Mouse Trap then this is the game for you. You can have more fun if you know other people that own a Nintendo DS so you can play against them."
4,A really good buy.,"This is one of the best musical toys for the quality and price. My son comes back to it again and again, in preference to the toy piano, zylophone, etc. Definitely a must have!"
4,Fun,"Fun for girls around 11 years old to fool around with and make stuff. The little jewels sometimes fall off, but for some crafty fun for kids its good."
2,not that good,"Hey, i thought that the tv series was great and had good pacing, music, stories, visuals etc. It wasn't science fiction, or fantasy, not even a ""universe created by a magic fairy"" type stuff. The series was a nice little visualization of the spirit of nature and one man's (Ginko's) understanding of that nature. In the original series, Ginko was like Odin, striding thru nature, having exchanged an eye for wisdom.The movie, on the other hand, it poorly paced, has uninspired acting and visuals (in fact this dvd looks very grainy, and even has some damage type artifacts, like damage circles that you see on old films!). There is way too much of Ginko as a kid and the old woman (who was really a very minor part of the original series. Overall, not worth the viewing."
5,Great movie!,"Really great movie.Not everything is true to the anime (Genki is wearing more traditional Japanese clothing rather than his western garb in the anime) but the cinematography and story telling are just what I expect from a live action movie.Watched this the very first day it arrived, and twice since.Love it!"
3,An interesting introduction to Chabuca Granda,"The previous reviewer is absolutely right that the organy accompaniment on this CD isn't the ideal. However, Chabuca Granda's interpretation and songwriting still shines through the worst of accompaniment. For the price I think this is a worthwhile CD and a good collection of one of South America's most important musicians."
2,careful,"Although the price was right, these Chinese made shoes are not as high quality as their German cousins. The sole seems less durable, and the fit not as good."
4,Forgotten Organ Concerto Merits a Listen,"Enrico Bossi is all but forgotten today, but he does have the distinction of writing instrumental music at a time when famous Italian composers were writing operas. As can be expected, his music is very dramatic, and the Organ Concerto, here in a version for full orchestra, is well-crafted and quite compelling, with memorable themes and a strikingly effective buildup to the finale in the third movement. (A recording of a later version of this concerto for organ and string orchestra and brass was once avaiable long ago on vinyl.)The recordings are from live performances and are well-engineered with acceptable balances between the orchestra and the organ in the concerto.Anyone familiar with the Rheinberger organ concertos will enjoy this concerto by Bossi. The other works are okay, but not as original as the concerto."
1,Time Travel & Pseudo-Scientific Jargon,"Time travel and what-have-beens are among my favorite type of book. Highly recommended are Anderson's TIME PATROL, Piper's LORD KALVAN or Dann's TIMESHARE series.However, Mr. Parkinson has produced a plot with a minimal storyline, characters with confusing pasts, presents and futures, a knowledge of history which would not do justice to a ten year old and glossed over this dross with mathematical constructs and scientific jargon in a mish-mash of nihilism. Having received the enire series plus his TIMECOP work, the best I would note is that Mr. Parkinson's writing is of a consistent level -- unfortunately, that level is poor."
5,The Winemaker's Daughter review,"The book was outstanding. I loved the idea of looking at water rights on a local level--the next global problem. The story was intriguing, and I didn't want it to end. I hope that Timothy Egan has more novels in his future."
5,Lotil cream,"My Mom turned me on to this product a few years ago and a small amount goes a long way. I especally use it in the winter on my cracked cuticles and it works wonders. You have to put it on every night faithfully with a bandaid so it doesn't rub off during the night till the crack goes away and it feels very soothing while it is on the problem spot. Works great keeping your skin hydrated, also."
3,Cordless Women's Shaver (Braun LS-5550),"I have never used an electric razor before, so I have nothing with which to compare this one. It works pretty well on underarms and the bikini area, though it takes a long time to get your legs done, as you have to go quite slow and redo spots. It doesn't give the smoothest shave either--not like a razor blade. You also cannot use it in the shower, which is unfortunate. It makes a fairly loud buzz sound, too, but I think that's common.The batteries last a really long time, and it's easy to hold and to clean. Overall I think it's a good product, once you get used to it and have read the instructions. The biggest advantage for me is there's no more razor burn or ingrown hairs!"
1,Waste of money,Save your money - you will go over an area several times. I went back to my basic razor.
3,It's not half-bad!,"Foolish is a heartbreaker, wouldn't you say folks? There isn't much fuzz guitar in this cat of a song, but there are break beats, steamy vocals, compelling lyrics surrounding abuse and mind-control and an all around jammin tune about being 'foolish' and remaining with a jilted, careless cheater. My own personal favorites also include Movies, with it's playful purrs and crackin vibe, as well as Shi Shi, cause woah - that is the closets thing to fuzz on a homegirl's album. Gee-yah! Pick it up!"
2,A Bad Translation?,"These are two comdedies that fail in a modern sense: a woodcutter as a doctorand a middle class fellow who wants ""Culture"". Coming from CaliforniaI have felt the sting of New York/ east coast snobbery andwanted to be able to reply.So the Bourgeois Gentlemanisn't funny to me: it is cruel.The Army made a medic of medespite of my religious history, so I sympathize with the poor woodcutter.Had the translation been better the plays might have survived them,but it fails the humor of the plays and they fall flat."
3,What's all the hype?,"I was really excited when I bought this CD because I thought she would deliver her voice and talent just as great as she did on Ja Rule's hits. Unfortunately, I didn't like a bunch of the songs on there. I think the CD could've been better. I don't know what all the hype is about. This is another proof that some singers songs only sound better featuring Ja Rule (such as ummm..J to tha L-O)."
1,half a star more like!,"i'm not a hater, an i don't wanna sound like a hater but the truth is this girl can't sing sha has NO talent. It'z kinda obvious what shez doing shes trying to take the title that was originally Aaliyah's an still always will be. princess of hip hop n r'n'b, i really don't think so, thats Aaliyah. Sorry ashanti go home n get a hobby coz it sure aint gonna be singing! HEY I HEARD burger king are hiring any one try there, if ur lucky u mite get a job as a cleaner IF UR LUCKY!"
2,A [Disappointment],Most of us came to hear Ashanti singing with Ja Rule. Ashanti has a nice voice but I find that her CD is so bubble gum-kiddy like-and not real. I was expecting so much more from Ashanti and I wouldn'T buy this CD again if it broke or if somebody [took] it.
4,Great Debut for Ashanti,I don't like Ashanti anymore because I realize that she's not a talented singer nor a dancer. Her first album was good though!!
3,Solid Debut album,"This disc is Ashanti's first effort at her own alubm. She makes a solid effort with some help from the Murder-Inc Label. What made me want to pick up the disc was hearing foolish everhwere on the radio, I had to hear what everyone was talking about. I was impressed. Good singing, good beats, good effort. I'm giving it three stars because it's nothing spectacular. I am a hard rater, and this is an average album. Good solid effort Ashanti.Top 5:HappyFoolishBabyMoviesLeaving"
3,Its not outstanding but its ok,"I bought this album because the voice of Ashanti is completely nice (at the right times), really alleviating. The music is far from exceptional but is good for trying to sleep (which is not supposed to seem thus insulting). The best songs are * 3.4.9.11 * in my opinion. I will listen to the whole album (without the skits) the basic music. It is calming. I recommend this album if you like slow r'n'b. Be warned Ashanti's singing voice, not everyone can face for long periods of time."
4,Ashanti: rising star or R&B.,Ashanti has proven herself to be a talented young lady who does not need to show off her body to be a good singer. Her voice and her style has proven to the public that she could be big. Very big. I plan on hearing more music from her in the years to come.
2,Sorry but the princess of hip hop-N- RnB she is not,"Calling ashanti the princess would be like comparing Mary J to Patti labelle. Mary J has a wonderful voice and I love all of her music in fact I own all of her CDs but, she can not beat patti or aretha. Aaliyah was and will always be the princess, I was upset when I heard this cd, I wanted my money back and I bought it used. Most of the songs are not original. Happy,(a little bit of mary.j sample) foolish and unfoolish (biggie samples) To add to that I was really disapointed when I heard her sing live, maybe on her next albulm she will be her self."
1,No Talent What so ever,"My advice is that you shouldn't waste your money on this cd. Ashanti has not one bit of talent to back up all the hype that's thrown at her. She's nowhere near the princess of pop. All these songs are boring and alike, and her voice isn't a nice one. All she's good for is looking good in the videos, not singing! Save your money on this one and buy someone worthwhile like Alicia Keys, or someone with talent!"
5,Ashanti is much better then expected!,"Unlike most cds these days, I can actually sit through every single song and this cd has atleast 7 possible hit singles on it. Considering it was her debut album and the fact that she wrote the lyrics makes it even more surprising. She, unlike other multi-platinum artist doesnt crowd her cd with guest appearances. I wouldn't go as far as calling her the princess of hip-hop and r&b(as stated in a song and booklet), but she is definitely on her way. ""Rescue"" is great."
1,An Aaliyah wannabe.,"I can't believe you call this RnB. Her songs are all about the same thing. (I have to leave you, Why did you leave me, you are so fine.) I bet she spent a lot of time listening to Aaliyah and then copied her. And what was with the hype?? I know better artists who deserved that airplay. Aaliyah, I am so sorry. Ashanti, you made a lot of money ripping off Aaliyah."
2,Another Aaliyah Clone&Another Safe Sample,"Predictable Artists&Acts today are like your Daily ROutine you know how&where everything is gonna land&where it all shall go.Ashanti bit the Debarge Hook for ""Foolish"" that Biggie Used a few years back.safe formula.and Her whole Presentation&Vibe reminds me of watered down Aaliyah but just going through the Motions.there will be 99 more Ashanti's within the next year.this Formula is really Safe but it Makes Dollars&as the saying goes if it ain't broke don't try fixing it."
1,An Aaliyah wannabe,"I can't believe this girl has a record deal for the following reasons:Her voice is annoying and whiny, and it sounds different on every song.She has no songwriting talent. Pretty much all of the songs are either about falling head over heals for a boy, leaving a boy, or choosing between two boys.She samples songs from other artists, which I think is a no-no.What she is good at is ripping off other artist. She probably spent a lot of time listening to Aaliyah and then copied her. And what was with the hype? I know other aritsts who deserved those grammy nominations. Ashanti, you made lots of money ripping off Aaliyah."
2,well,"On this album I found only about 5 good songs, nothing more. There was so much noise around this girl, and her duets with Ja Rule & Fat Joe made me think that the debut album will rock too, since she also writes songs, it must be good. Well the result was dissapointing! I never expected the album to be SO! So many songs and only very few really good, this is one problem of it, the other is that most of the songs sound the same way the previous did, so you get the feelin that its just a very big song singing in your speakers. I'm really sorry I got this album, I sould've bought the singles I liked and would never change my opinion on this girl. Nothing to do about this now,but what I have to add here is that this album is for die-hard fans, or in case you just need some background music while doin more usefull things!"
1,Horrid.,"Her voice is whiny, and lacks range, strength and depth. This is only exacerbated by her over-produced tracks and bland, senseless lyrics. She and JaRule should just form a little group and churn out their empty songs for those who don't mind subpar singing, songwriting, and producing."
4,Her best cd..........,This is her first cd. This is her greatest work because the production was more sensual. Chapter 2 was a big mistake after hearing that i could have sworn it was the wrong version or something. That ole skool thing was not cool dont ever try that again with your album Ashanti. STOP SAMPLING EVERYONE ELSES MUSIC........
2,Not so Great,The knob that turns the money worked well only one time. Now it is really hard to turn and often does not send the gumball down. Maybe it is not meant to be used and should just be decoration.
2,A sad attempt. Poorly written.,"It is too disorganized to keep your attention for very long. But that doesn't matter. You can read this very quickly with half your brain. Steinbrenner is a felon. Aside from that he is a greedy grasping swine with very little knowledge of baseball. He's just better at it (& rich). Very little in this book that will make a Yankee hater feel better.However, every year that the Yankees don't win the World Series is good for baseball. When the playoffs, pennant & the World Series are not brought (See the Mets this year) or won by the teams with the highest payrolls, that is good for baseball. Go parity! I paid $0.01 (plus S&H;) for my copy. That's about right."
2,Low-brow entertainment,"""Yankees Suck"" is a quick read that requires no brain power, and unfortunately very little brain power was used by the author either. The text is rambling and disorganized, and instead of any kind of summation, the book simply winds down to nothing. If you're a die-hard Red Sox fan you might find this book mildly amusing."
3,Considering Charles Simic,"After reading many of Charles Simic's works, I have to say that this book of poems was an easy and inspiring read. I find that reading his work lightens me up even if the content is at times dark. Simic seems to be writing through his darkness in this work and searching for the light at the end of the tunnel. He often uses humor in his darkness as well as obsurdity to reflect on the reality. It's a quick read and they are the kind of poems that you can read over and over again and always learn a deeper insight from them. He is an easy poet to relate to and definitely worth reading."
1,Frustrating,"I've had this phone for a little over a year. I loved it when I first got it, but it was all downhill after a few months. Battery never lasts more than 12 hours(thats without any talk time), dosen't recognize when its charging most of the time, outside cover is cracked, the actual phone part does not work at all anymore. Its hard to get good reception on it and it drops all of my calls. I've not been able to use anything but speakerphone since july. First it was just low volume, then it quit completely. I know at least 6 people with this phone who have the same or at least similar problems. I've taken good care of my phone, never dropped it or anything, and yet its worse than phones I've had in the past that were 2+ years old and had been dropped, etc. My cell company also will not let me upgrade, so I think any day now I may just throw my phone out of my car on the freeway."
4,Not good for use outside/sunlight,"If you need to use this phone alot outside in bright conditions consider getting something else. You absolutely cannot see the LCD display on the cover or the inside of the phone in sunlight. This means you cannot see who is calling, you cannot see if you have a missed message, if you do have a message you cannot see who it was from, you can't type a text message, you can't read a text message, you can't make a call (except blindly) and you cant take or view a photo if there is bright sunlight. If you take this thing skiing, to the beach, etc. it's almost unusuable.Except for the problem with viewing the screen it seems to be a fairly well designed and full-featured phone. I'm not overly fond of the motorola menu navigation, but will get used to it."
2,Only worked for 10 months,"Call me crazy but I actually expect a phone to last at least long enough to get you to the next 'free phone with sign-up' deal. I just got this phone last December and it is already dying. First, it stopped charging properly. Then, I lose the ability to hear anything unless I am on speakerphone- which sucked from the beginning since it is grainy at best. Besides this, it has some poor design features: having the ring volume on the outside of the phone is not cool. Not only do I hit it all the time when it is in my purse and hear the little audio blip (not cool in some situations) but I have actually managed to turn the ring off this way before. Come on guys, at least warn me that the free phone is absolute crap and I can shell out the money for a phone that actually works!"
2,The V551 Mortorola,"The telephone is a lemon plain & simple. It has so many problems you can not even imagine. If approached to buy this tele "" Run "". Cingular is a good Company, I give it a 5 star plus , they just need to take this telephone off the market."
2,Bad Battery,"The battery is a big problem. I bought it less than one month ago, and now it can only sustain one day, for about 1-2 hour talking time/day. It's far below my expectation, even though I did what the retailer told me to do: charge 24 hours before the first time use.In addition, the plug that connects the phone and charger is not well designed. Sometimes I have to really push hard to begin charging, otherwise, it won't work. Also the user interface when you try to turn on the phone during charging is confusing.If you want to use Cingular, I recommend a Samsung phone."
2,BAD VOLUME!!,"My phone did work well for a few months when i first got it. But for the past 4 months it has been getting harder and harder to hear people even though the volume is all the way up. i have to push the phone so hard up against my ear that my hand starts to hurt. Also, the camer takes good pictures, but then when u want to go look at past pictures you took, they are all scambled or blury.i DO NOT recomend this phone. I plan on getting a new and better phone as soon as possible so i can actually hear people when they call."
4,I Like It!,"I really like this phone. It has so many great features! The pictures it takes are great. You can't expect some top notch pictures that are similar to pictures taken with a camera but for phone quality pictures, they are pretty good. I love the way this phone has the speed dials! It's great. And some complain about the reception but usually that has to do with the area you live in and the service you have there. My husband has this same phone and so does my best friend. They both really like it also and have no major complaints! This phone is a lot of fun and I like it! I recommend it!"
1,One of the worst phones I have ever owned,"Overall the phone is very stylish but lacks in all other areas.Pros-Stylish great looking phone-Bluetooth capableCons-Build quality feels cheap, most of the ones I have encountered begin making a snapping or cracking noise after a short time when you open or close the phone-Terrible reception-Earpeice volume is nearly impossible to hear even at highest volume-Screen is impossible to see outdoors"
2,Disappointed in Bluetooth capability,"I purchased this phone specifically for the bluetooth technology. I also purchased a Motorola HS810 bluetooth headset to go with it. My prior experience with bluetooth is that it is always ON. NOT SO with this phone! Every time I turn on my phone or open the boom for the HS810, I have to go through the menu to reconnect to my bluetooth HS810! For me, this defeats the purpose. Of course I can always leave the phone and HS810 on and never turn them off, but that's a waste of battery for me. Very Disappointing in this age of technology."
3,"Great phone, worthless battery life","I've had this phone for about a month. I get about 36 hours of battery charge with maybe 20 minutes of talking before the battery goes dead. That is without using the other features of the phone. (Bluetooth, games, speakerphone, etc). The battery life makes this phone useless as a wireless phone, because it's always connected to the charger. Otherwise the phone is great and full of features."
1,STAY AWAY!!!,This phone is no good.. Ear volume is WAY too quiet. Signal jumps up and down and all around. Calls hang and do not complete connection.
3,Not a bad world phone!,"I've had this phone for just over a year and use it with my Cingular service. This isn't a bad phone. It's a world phone, has the normal phone book (with fax, email, multiple phone numbers), calendar, internet, calculator, voice recorder, downloadable games and ringtones, external caller ID/VM notification/text message, and signal strength, etc. What I don't like is short battery life and having the ringer set up on the side of the phone. Whenever I bump the side of the phone I change my ringers from what I have it set to, to something else. Annoying. Call quality is... eh, okay. Motorola didn't hit their mark with this phone, but it's been reliable. I guess that's all I can ask for."
1,Not a Sony Ericsson,"I tried it. After one hour of fidgeting with it's childish userun-friendly interface, the darn delayed number buttons, no games, dreadful ring options, I want my T637 back.I'll do with less resolution in pics, no video to have a more grown-up phone.This V551 is going back."
2,*yawn*,"This book was SO boring. I really, really wanted to like this book. I promise that I tried, but nothing ever happens in this story! Also, the characters and their relationships are poorly developed. Usually there is at least one redeeming quality to a book, but I can't find any for this one. The only reason to pick this book up is if you need help falling asleep."
3,"Loreal Has a Nice Product, It Just didn't Work For Me",This product felt good on the face however I was of the opinion it would help to remove wrinkles and firm up the skin along the jaw line. This is the same story most cosmetic companies claim. They don't work. I was a person in the sun quite a bit when I was younger and therefore have some wrinkles on my face. Oh well........
5,Great product,"Love this anti-wrinkle cream. The product delivers exactly as it states. Great product, great manufacturer. I would highly recommend this item."
3,moisterizer,I don't feel the product did anything that I was led to believe. Probally would try a different product. It did arrive in a timely manor.
5,Pure fun to hear,"This was a pure joy to listen to while at work. I lost my copy in a house fire and am saddened to find it impossible to purchase again in the same condition. However, that is life.I heartily recommend this album to anyone who enjoys piano music or light listening."
1,won't stay closed!,just got this today and the closure won't stay in! if I want to use it I'll have to tape over the hole right away. not worth trying to return.
4,"Great Cookbook- easy, good food","This is not about fancy cooking or exotic ingredients. For the most part, this book is full of one pot meals that you can make with very little effort. Every recipe I have tried has been easy to make with on hand ingredients.I particularly liked the wide variety of recipes: casserole recipes, crock pot recipes, wok recipes, one pan/pot recipes etc.I refer to this one many times when planning meals or looking for a last minute meal to prepare."
4,my preference to colored pencils,"This lead is weak like the colored lead in wood pencils; I have to use less pressure and work with a shorter amount of lead coming out of the pencil to avoid it breaking. Having said that, I prefer using this lead in my mechanical pencils over colored wood pencils because the color is vivid enough to read, and I get all the advantages of my mechanical pencils. I colored the silver tops of two of my drafting pencils red and blue to match the lead inside, and when I need a little color, bam, they're right there ready to go.The blue lead is also good."
2,Stick with Gamma...,"Not crazy about this one. Too much orchestration that makes it sound like a Hollywood soundtrack. Plus I'd rather hear Gene Pitney belt out 'Town Without Pity' than the Montrose sing-along on here. Too cheesy for my tastes...If you really want to hear Montrose SMOKE, then get the Gamma 1 and Gamma 2 CDs that Wounded Bird has also recently reissued. You'd do a lot better with these two LPs that RM recorded for Elektra back in '79 and '80."
4,I'd give it 5 stars but it's too short.,"This album, like a good caffeine buzz, is intense and fun but too short to be enjoyed properly. I listen to a tonne of Death Metal and other extremes in Metal so I know what I'm saying when I say the music is really good and the vocals are diverse and mostly intelligible. I would have given it a 5/5, but the album is too short."
3,Dark Moon Crossing,"It was a fast-paced mystery with a very likable heroine. This was my first view of Sylvia Novel's work, and I would like to explore others."
5,AWESOME SCANNER,This scanner really works great. I scanned an old photo and I was able to completely restore it- even the tear in the middle!
3,Too wide for my leg,I'm kinda skinny and these were just way too wide for my calves so I ended up returning them as soon as I got them and tried them on.
3,Three Quarters of a Good Documentary,"I enjoyed the series and all the stories, but thought T.J's story was the weakest of the four. T.J. came across as an angry and ungrateful knucklehead and lost my sympathy when he started protesting against the USA and the president of the country where he was a guest. Would an American transsexual have been treated the same way in Cyprus protesting and speaking out against their leadership? I suspect not. I think the series would have been stronger if it had left T.J. on the cutting room floor. Maybe T.J. will grow up someday and realize that good grades and a college degree are nice, but your intelligence doesn't mean a thing if you don't have common sense and behave like a knucklehead."
1,Junk,This book is a piece of junk and there is a reason why this publication is only $1. It is unclear and inaccurate and not worth the paper is is printed on. On top of that there is absolutely no supplemental material to clarify abysmal drawings and missing explanations.
4,cute!,"The wings and antennae are very cute and durable, as far as costume stuff can be anyway. :) My daughter went as Ladybug Girl and she looked just like her with these accessories! Very cute!"
1,Don't buy from Musician's Friend,"Product was OK but ""Musician's Friend"" automatically adds you to their catalog mailing list so order from someone else unless you like junk mail."
5,A frightning look on brain-washing and Nazi-ism.,"This is an young adult book that is clear and great for suspence. As being a kid jew, it is extremly hard to understand the death camps, Hitlers ways, and how someone could do that. Todd Strasser's (in my opinoin)best book is written in wonderful words. I recomend this book to anyone who loves to read horror, sci. fiction, and/or adventure books. For a very long time, this was my favorite book."
4,It was worth the time it took to read it.,It was a good book and since it was based on a real story it was chilling to read that something like that could happen again.The story builds upp in a perfect way and as you make your way through the last pages it is purley fantasic. The only complaint I have is that it was a bit too short for a book-worm like me.
3,The Wave,"The book ""The Wave"" is based on a true story that took place in Palo Alto, California in 1969.It was about a classroom experiment that went a little too far. The motto in the book is "" Strength through disipline, strength through community, strength through action,"" governs the entire school, and many more around.Only two students recognize ""The Wave"" wave for what it really is (Laurie Saunders and Davis Collins) which are two of the main charecters in the book. They set out to stop the wave before it gets too out of hand! But is it too late?Read ""The Wave"" to find out what happens!I personally did not like the book that much but it would have to be a personal decision by whoever reads it.-Cheyenne-"
3,"The book was good with detail, but slow.","The book was pretty good, but it only got interesting at about the 5th chapter, besides that I really enjoyed reading this book."
3,The Wave,"""The Wave"" was an interesting book. Because it's a true story. The only disadvantage in the book is that it's boring in the first couple of chapters. it's about some teenagers in a school. Their teacher starts a movement called ""The Wave"". The so Called Wave gets out of hand. The movement started after they saw a movie about ""The world war two"". Some of the students were touched by the movie. Laurie didn't like ""The Wave"", and she tries to stop it. Every one was against her, even her best friends and her boyfriend.By: Robert Hols (Sweden)"
3,My own opinion about The Wave.,I think the book is very boring after twelve chapters. The whole book is about the Wave and it's members. I think it's not a good book. It's getting boring because it's about the same thing all the time. But on some places in the book you get excited and want to know more. I think it's okay to read the book in school but not private. I say to private buyers: It's not worth the money it costs.
1,Quotables,"The Wave does not give a dynamic character description. This book describes a history teacher's experiment about dicipline,[...]. To begin, The Wave did not give a thorough description of the character's thoughts and behaviors. The author should state whether David, a student, liked the Wave or not. It seemed that David could never make up his mind. The author should also give more detail about David's behavior. For instance, David attacked Laurie, his girlfriend, then suddenly decided to be nice and agree with her. The author should tell why David liked the idea of the Wave then heard Laurie's opinion and agreed with her. This proves that the wave is not well written and does not provide a good character description."
3,Nice story.but a little boring,"I like the story because it can happen to everybody,it's nice to read but very easy to guess the end."
5,Great book and everybody should get a chance to read it!!!,I read this book with my English class and I think it was a great book. I taught us that you can not go to far with certian things.
4,Interesting,"I found this book to be very interesting and fascinating as I kept on reading. The book also forces through alot of different themes to us that we can think about. The ending really proves to us that yes, we can change even though we say that we won't."
5,Ben Ross was a very corageous teacher,"The Wave is about an experiment constructed by a high school history teacher named Ben Ross. It was carried out to answer a simple question: How could so many people allow themselves to take part in a the massive genocide during the Nazi occupation in Europe? Mr. Ross didn't have a definitive answer to the question. Instead he started an experiment with the students unbeknownst to the students.It's hard to objectively say whether Mr. Ross' experiment went to far. In the end, people were hurt physically, emotionally and socially. However, the experiment answered their question and they learned an unforgettable lesson: the dangerous imperfections of the human mind.The story isn't incredibly well-written, but it is definitely an entertaining read. The book leaves the impression that there are only three types of people: skeptics, disciples and various degrees and deviations between those two."
3,The Wave in a nutshell,"The Wave is a book about a High School history teacher who is asked a question about the Nazis, which he can not answer. Later that day, he studies up about the Nazi's education policies and develops a ""social experiment"" witch he enacts on his students, and basically brain washes many of them within quite a small period of time.As many of you know, The Wave was based on a true story. The first time you hear the story its interesting and you just want to know more, but the times after that it just becomes too generic and repetitive. Also, the book places itself for a ""big bang"" at the ending, which is surprising the first time, but unfortionatly soon after the book ends with a weak, abrupt ending. My final verdict is that the book is not that bad, and i would advise you to read it; however, try to find the book used or on a bargan shelf because you will not find yourself reading it again and again."
2,2.5 stars,"A minor, if expected, diseaster brings together two friends in junior high gym class. After saving Stella from embarrassment, Emily becomes her life long best friend, seeing her through the labyrinth of dating with unconventional wit and wisdom and a due amount of sarcasm. Along the way come assorted heartaches; death, divorce, sour relationships, and betrayals. Even when an ocean and something bordering on treachery stand between them, Stella and Emily remain true sisters of the heart, working their way towards a good ending. For fans of the series Sisters or the movies Beaches or Steel Magnolias, this will be a read that is highly likely to be something enjoyable. The main flaw in the execution lies with the seesawing between past and present.Joy is in the ears that hear..or the eyes that see"
1,"breaks easily, mattress and pillows flatten","the wooden slats break easily, the arms break, so they just fall down, and the mattress and pillows flatten.don't waste your money"
2,This book is only for The Apprentice Lover.,"I gave this book two stars because the book was a little boring and dragged on in some areas. The best information was in the margins and the quotes not really any of the information in the book. I have read: Carolyn, Bill, and Amy's books and I want to give this one a try.This book is truly for The Apprentice TV lover but if you are looking for business advice this is not the book for you."
4,"Treat bad, Ball good.","The treats designed for this thing are made from pretty poor ingredients, and had my dog coughing for a few hours after eating one. It also took 5 seconds for my dog to get the treat from the ball. However, i stuck a piece of beef jerky inside the ball, and my dog was busy for an hour. It was like catnip for dogs. Toss the treat, stuff something tasty inside the flaps in the center of the ball, and its worth the money."
2,"Not quite ""everlasting""","First of all, let me say that all toys labeled ""indestructible"" or ""everlasting"" should be tested on dachshunds! Gave this toy to my dog and watched to see how long it took him to get the treat out. 14 seconds! I thought maybe I didn't have it in correctly, so I tried again later. He got it out even faster the second time because he knew how to do it. He liked the ball though, so I let him continue to play with it. I came back into the room minutes later to find him tearing pieces of rubber off. I will say that the treats themselves take him about 5 minutes to eat, so now I just give him the treats. (I bought quite a few when I bought to ball to save on shipping later) My advice if you are looking for something truly indestructible is to purchase a Kong. No other toy has proven itself against my dog and you can put treats inside."
2,My Husky/Lab had this in pieces in less than 30 minutes,"I bought this since it is made by the same people who make the green treat ball. That ball is virtually indestructible as the description says. This one, however, was shredded into pieces within half an hour of having it out of the shipping box."
2,Not everlasting,"My dog, a 5 month old Irish setter/golden mix, LOVES it. From the moment we took it out of the packing, he went to town. I, however, am not very sold. We decided that the treat ball would only be given to him during ""special"" times when he needs to be entertained. That being said, he's only had it for 4 days during certain times and he is almost through both sides of the treat. It isn't lasting long at all!! Also, he was able to get the treat out once, which made me nervous, but hasn't done it since. I'm not sure if we will keep buying the treats or not. They aren't cheap enough to justify him going through them in less than a week. I'm disappointed to say the least."
1,Had ball out in 2 minutes!,"I just brought this home and gave it to my dog(cattle dog mix) and she literally had it out in 2 minutes flat. This is supposed to provide hours of interactive chewing challenge(as it states on packaging) but it didn't even give 5 minutes! I guess if your dog is a master chewed like mine, the extreme kong is a better choice."
1,My dog will not touch this toy.,"I gave the ball with the treat stuck inside to my dog yesterday. He would not go anywhere near it. He sniffed the toy and treat and then walked away and it hasn't been touched since. I think what's turning him off is the smell of the plastic ball itself. It has a VERY strong fake-vanilla scent to it which is unpleasant to humans but must be overwhelmingly gross to a dog. By the way, my dog is not at all picky. He will play with anything and eat anything so this is a real first!Also, I looked at the ingredients for the treat and it's all absolute junk. The first ingredients are wheat and gluten."
1,Everlasting HA,I bought this for my dog and he destroyed it in less that 5 minutes. I just kept seeing orange plastic everywhere. He had destroyed the whole thing treat and all. When I called about it they said well did you have a treat in it? It just came out of your stupid package with one in it so uhhh yes. Wost toy ever
2,Toy Survived-Treat Didn't,Spent $20 thinking this would keep my dog entertained for a little while. Within a few minutes she had removed the treat from the ball and was happily munching away on it. She loved the treat but defeated the whole concept. Not worth my $20.
1,uhhhh...,"My younger dog has gotten bored lately, and chewing anything she can get ahold of in our shed. I went out last night in an attempt to find something that will keep her occupied. For $20 I bought this, took it home and had hope for about 7 minutes. She got the treat out, and I messed up by pushing it in too hard, and getting it stuck in between the 2 sides. (In theory, this was the most amount of time the toy went without having the treat popped out.) After she licked at that for a while, I was able to push the treat out and get it back to the place that it belonged. Pop. Pop. Pop. She is now a pro treat grabber, who can get these everlasting discs out within 3 seconds flat. 2 if you don't count the time she sniffed at it. Now I have a $20 ball to play fetch with."
1,Not worth the money at all!,"I have tried many toys designed to be for strong chewers and this one one of the worst, within ten minutes my dog had removed both treats from both sides of the holder and ate the treats in under 20 minutes! Not well designed if your dog is a strong chewer! And definetly WAY overpriced for what it offers."
3,Definitely not everlasting,"I bought one of these, left my dogs with it, came back home a couple hours later and one or both of them has already eaten the entire thing. That's far from everlasting. It would have been a complete waste of money, but they do like the rubber toy (so much they fight over it) and I can still fill it with other treats, peanut butter, or cheese like I do with their Kong toys. So, it is still useful and they seem to prefer it over the Kongs."
1,WARNING!!!,"Our 11 week old Bullmastiff puppy, Jolene, died this week after playing with this toy. She was able to get the chicken treat ball out of the toy and got it lodged in her throat. She received prompt emergency vet assistance but died in the emergency room. Please do not purchase this product for you pets."
1,Gone in 20 min,"I have a 2 year old small rottweiler mix. When i bought this toy she was just shy of 1 1/2 and was chewing through everything so after chewing through our third red kong in the matter of a month I was getting desperate and decided to try the everlasting treat ball. I bought the large size to slow her down. In five min she plucked out the treat and devoured it. Since the toy itself must of still had the smell of the treat she proceeded to rip the ball itself apart. In the 20 min I left her alone with this toy it was in about 30 little pieces, and then i had the pleasure of finding more pieces as they came out the other end. Overall the only thing that can actually withstand her if a large black kong (she cracks them in about 2 months) and the nylabone (those last four months) but this treat ball is anything but everlasting."
2,Didn't Pass The Test,"I bought this Treat Ball with my Aussie puppy in mind; I wanted something that would keep her busy while in her crate AND something that she couldn't destroy within a few minutes. She had the actual chicken treat out of the ball within minutes; I replaced it. My other Aussie mix had it out of the ball within less than a minute. After the treat was consumed, they got to work on the ball itself...it's a great item for my dachshunds, but for the Aussies and the German Shepherd, it's hardly ""Everlasting"". Darn it! I was hoping I finally found something that the little herders couldn't immediately destroy!"
2,It's okay but...,"I have a Labrador who is a strong chewer and I warned the lady at the store that he is smart with treat dispensing toys - I was really interested in the one pictured on the back that screws together for him and she convinced me he'd never get the middle treat out. Two minutes and it was out, four minutes and it was gone. I have resorted to cutting the new Kong Ziggy's in half, and jamming them between the flaps and as of writing this - he's been busy for 15 minutes. :) It's a durable enough toy and he seems to really like the squishy factor."
2,"One loves it, One doesn't","I can honestly say that I am not sure how i feel about this product yet. I have two Corgis and one loves it the other not so much. BUT ... i give it to my dogs only when i put them in the crate. My corgi that loves it is a boredom chewer so it makes sense that she would enjoy it, especially since it has ""bonus treats"" in the bottom. My other one just lies in the crate looking angry, as if to say "" you think that treat is going to keep me happy while your gone?""I give it three stars because it is fair.***UPDATE***The company must have changed the formula or something because it made both my dogs sick (both ends)."
3,Dog ate toy,I got this toy for my 8 mo old pit bull.She took the chew thing out and chewed the ball up.
3,Two Stars,"We like both Kevin Klein and Diane Keaton. It's a ""cookie cutter"" cute movie with no major plot or big moments."
3,Not a dog movie ...,"It's about relationships, not the directors best work by far. If you're a fan of the lead actors then rent it. The ending is a bit far fetched, but overall worth your time and money."
3,Darling Companion,"The movie was good on the whole as a movie, but the end was too fast and left you hanging as to what was going to happen."
3,Very cute movie,"I ordered this mostly because it come with Ultraviolet download which I think is the greatest thing that every happened for streaming movies and video. When I watched it and found that the dog was the ""Darling Companion"" that had gotten separated from its family, It was easier to watch. (I had a similar experience with a dog only I didn't find mine back). The story turned out to be somewhat of a tear jerker but it was okay - worth the $ I paid for it."
3,Good but could have been better.,This film would have been so much better if there had been more chemistry between Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline. Both are very good in their roles...just not together. Maybe Robert De Niro or even Sam Shepard (who has a pitifully small role in the film) might have been better choices. There is very little character development before the 'crisis' occurs that makes up the cause or the story of the film. Dianne Wiest and Richard Jenkins demonstrate just what chemistry between two actors can mean...both are great. All in all not a bad movie to rent but probably not worth purchasing.
3,Pretty in package but not very sturdy,"I got this item as shown, and it was a bit of a process getting them attached to my Coralife fixture. Once I had them screwed in I had to find a way to space them just so on the fixture as not to off set the lighting from the tank or allow it to fall into the water. I had two people to help my properly seat the mounting legs so the hugged the tank and then tighten them into place. Even after everything was erected the mounts came loose and became very wobbly."
4,An important warning message.,"This is an interesting film. But how did the shown survivors survive the collapse? The survivors are shown here in 2210, healthy, well dressed and with advanced electronics gadgets analyzing the remains of civilization 200 years prior. They find these objects in the desert. But what part of the world do these survivors come from? (I'm not sure but it appears that the film suggests that the whole world has become a desert.) That puzzle makes this film less believable than it would otherwise be. But the film does show much of what is being predicted now, including fights over resources and food crises. The film also, and rightly, speaks about humans going primarily for short-term interests and that we are the victims of our own success.The film is worth watching especially for the warning message that it gives."
2,Hate the game play!,Not as great as they say it is and hate how it plays through the game playing. All is money wasted on a game that really is rated to high.
5,Very strategic very real,I own this game on Nintendo 64 and now on Game Cube and both was (like I said )very strategic and very real.
1,Sucked!,"This movie totally sucked! It's not even a B grade movie. It's an F grade! I'd give it minus ten stars if the scale allowed it. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. I suggest the Shinobi no Mono series, American Ninja 1 - 4 (not 5), Sho Kosugi's ninja movies, The Hunted (1995) and the Law of Shinobi series."
2,Really bad Hong Kong style action,"I didn't expect wire work in a Japanese ninja flick, but it's in this one. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you'll probably like this. I don't and I didn't. I'll be glad when Japanese directors stop throwing After Effects at every scene and get back to making entertaining movies."
3,The Black Swan,I'm a great Mercedes Lackey fan. I'm always waiting for the next book. But The Black Swan was a bit disapointing. I must agree with Nimue MacCunail! They were right on in their review.
3,I loved the cover art! :),"Well, I loved the cover art, but comparing this book to the Fire Rose by Mercedes Lackey, it's not nearly as good. Anything Lackey is worth buying, :), but buy Valdemar and Fire Rose first. Odile was certainly the book's main character, yet her only love interest was in ""Benno"". ::sighs::. Also, Odette was shallow, and Siegfried was a stupid womanizer who fell for Odette, the beauty queen. GO ODILE! :("
3,Not what I was expecting,"To put it into the simplest words, it wasn't what I expected from an author that had done so well before. From the summary in the book, and the cover, I expected something deeper, more intricate, instead of something that has a very ""good guys win"", ""bad guys lose"" philosophy. And, the transformation of Siegfried is a little too dramatic and great in a very short time. I couldn't attach myself to any of the characters. Far less than I expected"
1,just an stereotype,Colombia is famous for its violence. but it is just like saying Americans are white. this video does not show a reality but just an stereotype of what people ( who have never visited) think about this country. it is a pity how a video can be manipulated.
3,Works with internet but not as high quality as hoped for,"This phone, as advertised, works with wireless internet without interrupting service. However, the voice quality is not as high as expected -- there is still some ""crackling"" on the line. The other big, negative surprise is that there is no headset jack on the telephone, something that I had assumed it would have. For that reason, if you spend a lot of time on the phone, then this is not the model for you."
1,Razor BMX Bike,"We saw this bike online and my son fell in love with it. We ordered the item, and it arrived with torn outer packaging and no packing material around the bike and the bike had clearly sustained damage. We returned the bike with ease. We ordered another bike thinking the packaging on the first one was just a fluke, but once again, the bike came with the box torn and this new bike was also damaged. I would not recommend purchasing this product over the internet."
4,happy buyer,I bought this as a for my boyfriend as a buisness card holder however he is actually using it as a wallet instead and is quite happy with it.
4,Aluminum card case,This product is just what I need when I carry the basic essentials. Several people have asked where I got it.
1,Rip off,"As others have noted this book is a rip off. Of the 12 Chapters 6 are completly unrelated to Portal deveelopment. Chapter 2 is Searching with Lucene, 3 - Messaging with Apache James, 4 Object to Relational Mapping with Jakarta OJB and 5 is Content Management with Jakarta Slide.In fairness there are a couple of useful sections - but overall its quite incomplete."
1,Loose stone,"I fell in love with this set the minute I saw it, so I bought it immediately. I wore it for about a week and the large center stone fell out. Down the shower drain!! Needs to be faceted stronger!!! While I'm a little disapointed, the company has responded quickly and super friendly and is replacing it immediately."
1,not worth it,"Although the seller did ship the item promptly, I am very disappointed with the product. This wine rack is way overpriced for what you are getting. It is awkward to assemble as it requires nailing thin headless nails (brads). The wood is cheap quality and prone to splitting. There is no good way to line up the parts to make sure everything is even and square. If you don't have additional tools of your own like straps or large C-clamps, it would be hard to assemble.I would not recommend this item."
2,"Silly, Not Scary.","I'm sorry, but this album is truly pushing the boundaries of sophomoric ridiculousness. I love avant-garde music, but hearing this sort of drivel is about as scary as, and the artistic equal of, a low budget cheesy slasher flick.Truly a end of party clearer as it has so little musical merit."
4,Salsa,This is for me a simple example of the Venezuelan salsa music I knew and loved while I worked in that country.....nostalgic and well orchestrated..
1,yeast was dead,old yeast probably sitting in a warehouse. didnt work at all. too bad because hagen products are usually the best.
4,not too shabby,"I have mixed reviews but overall I'm KIND of happy. I love the convenience of it!! It does not get in my way as far as field of view and it is obviously very easy to grab both ends and draw the shade. I live in Florida so the sun is pretty intense. The shade glue to your windshield, but one side melted right off the windshield! And it does not block out the heat as much as I thought it would. So I stuck the side that came off back on the windshield and did not use it for a few weeks and now I'm drawing the shades again. Fingers crossed that the glue holds this time!! I do get great comments from passengers and other people that see me use them and they always ask where they can get shades for their car too! Much easier than a big board in your car."
1,oh my god!!,"I am german and looking for a good way to teach my american fiance my language. This book is pure horror. Don't waste your money on it, it makes neither sense nor is it a way to impress. Learn ""propper"" german before you go slang. It saves you a great deal of embarressment.This book should be taken from the market. Sad that any german author thinks that is the way to TEACH someone."
1,DONT BUY!,"Hi,I am a graduate student from germany. After I just read the excerpts online, I could not believe that anyone ever bought this poor book and thinks it is a good start to learn Colloquial German. Living 25 Jears in Germany I definitely know what German slang is like and this book doesn't have the foggiest idea. Please don't ever use one of the words from the book in Germany!"
3,puzzle glows but may not be very durable,"For the price, you can't really complain. I suspect the recyclability of the puzzle explains why it came out of the box a little shoddy in construction. However, if you take care in constructing it, it will come out just fine, and if you have a dinosaur FANATIC like we do, the glow-in-the-dark aspect will be worth it. The fun is in the surprise of what actually glows from inside the picture. I was disappointed in the condition of it out of the box, but like I said, for 5.99, what the heck."
4,Cartoon,I love these old cartoons I share with my kids. I wish they downloaded as one long series verses all separate episodes for easier viewing.
3,Great insight of the Polish people during pre-WWll,Love history of times past and of the time pre-WWll when the world was young and people trusted almost everyone...
2,How do you like your batteries? Fried or Easy-Over?,"A great way to prepare ""fried Ni-MH"" batteries - if you like that sort of entree. The people at the Battery Store should give this to all their customers as a way to drum up business.Seriously - only use this if you absolutely must have batteries charged in very short order. It did that very quickly. However, the batteries wouldn't hold much of a charge ever again. I have managed to ruin 8 new batteries - assuming it was just having a hard time getting used to living with me. [""I'm sure it will work better next time! It must have been a very old battery and ready to die at any time"", ""Hmmm, it just killed 2 new batteries""] Talk about a glutton for punishment. ""Let me know if you have any prime real estate for sale in Florida."" -- God knows I'll buy anything - at least twice."
4,great for travel,took this on my trip to Germany and was able to recharge batteries quickly and conveniently. It is small and easily portable. Great buy!
3,Average,"I liked spitalfield's debut ""remember right now"" alot. I liked their follow-up ""stop doing bad things"" even better. So, in theory, ""Better Than Knowing Where You Are"" should be better still, right? Wrong. I had my doubts about this being a quality record after hearing the lackluster first single ""secrets in mirrors"" a month back, and those doubts became knowledge after listening to this CD front to back this morning. It isn't really a bad record, but it just feels so average. Nothing stands out or begs to be listened to again like on past Spitalfield releases. Every song is just, blah.Hopefully it'll grow on me a bit in time, but I won't be holding my breath. Spitalfield and ""Better Than Knowing Where You Are"" join Underoath, Thursday, Billy Talent, Three Days Grace and New Found Glory in being one of this years most disappointing follow-up records."
5,I was suspect at first....,"I bought these surrounds thinking ""these will never work."" After I reviewed the direction and watched a you tube video. I jumped in feet first. It was a little hard lining up in the beginning but after I did the first one the second one was easier then the first. Now my Cerwin Vegas are beating like they used to. And to think I was gonna pay $120 for a new speaker plus delivery."
1,Nite Ize lite ride straps,I went thru 2 lite ride staps in about 2 months when using them for a AAA flashlight mounted on bike handlebars. They both tore thru on the narrow end. I am trying TwoFish staps now.
4,Nice change,This coffee was a nice change from our ordinary coffee. Not quite as good as a Pumpkin Latte at our favorite coffee shop but pretty darn close.
4,French Clarinet Music,"This c.d. is a great mix of some of the best known and often unrecorded clarinet music that really needs to be heard. I have purchased this c.d. because I wanted to hear Bucolique by Eugene Bozza, it is the ONLY recording I have been able to track down. The music on this c.d. is performed by a talented clarinetist, whom we can thank for recording these French pieces that clarinetists all over the world can appreciate-I know I certainly do. Check out Solos De Concours and take advantage of the discount that they have offered on this great collection!"
4,leadsinger,"The cartridges are a good system for storage and play. There is one very big issue with this company..their list of songs that is provided with the basic unit and some of the cartridges is in error, which makes it impossible to find songs without scrolling through the whole list (100-300 songs). Their website list has been wrong for 2 months now and direct contact with their customer service yields less than nothing.Otherwise, we have been happy with the system."
3,good product,"The whiskers themselves are pretty well made, works like they should. the reason for only giving three stars was the shipping,Expedited Shipping which should have been here well before the rest of my order which was standard shipping the whiskers were received about a week and a half after placing my order. other than that it is a great product."
3,Monopoly,"This was a total change from the boardgame. It is a lot of fun, however I have changed the winning amount, otherwise someone can win the whole game with just one hand."
4,Tiny,"Great for emergencies, a little tricky to figure out (switch down - as in the picture = open/ switch UP = closed) since its reverse from natural common sense. Also tricky to engage a Presta valve, but I mostly blame the French for that. Its tiny, doesnt bother when I ride and hides behind my water bottle holder.I would suggest getting a floor pump for regular use though. And also a little disappointed that Topeak sells a pump without a pressure gage attached!"
1,Pump actually destroys presta valves!,"I use this pump exclusively to fill up tubes with Presta valves. In the six months I've had it it has destroyed 6 tubes.The rubber part on the end is a tight fit over the Presta valve closure. Every once in a while, removing the Topeak (which takes a fair amount of force) rips the Presta valve closure from the valve, which means you need a new tube.Of course Schrader valves don't have this problem. Now that I've had experience with this pump breaking 3 different brands of tubes, I'm going to have to buy another brand."
4,Topeak Bike Pump,"Not as fast as a floor pump, but much cheaper and far more convenient. Lack of a pressure gauge is a bit annoying, but not a deal-breaker. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Tore off my stem valve,Used this bike pump once and it tore out my stem valve. I sent the pump back and had to order a new inner tube.
5,Great teeny pump!,"It's so little! (and lightweight) But strong, well-built, easy to mount (plastic mount is built to wrap around underneath your water bottle holder), and stays securely on the bike. It works great!"
1,VERY pleased. Excellent for wheelchair use. But didn't last well.,"We got this for use on a wheelchair with inflatable rubber tires. Getting to the valve on the wheel is problematic, but that would be the case with any pump. This does work very well to inflate the tires and is small enough to keep with the chair so it can be used at any time. Highly recommended!!REVISED: After a few months' use, the device became problematic. No amount of pumping would increase the tire pressure. It's now useless. Shame."
1,Useless,"I made several attempts to inflate a tire with this useless device, to no avail. Makes a perfect gift for your worst cyclist enemy. Mine is resting permanently in a Tulsa landfill where it belongs."
1,Didn't Work,This was a complete waste of money. I just threw it away. I would not buy this and buy something else.
4,easier to pump than the previous pump i had,"i had an old pump before surprisingly the topeak pump was great , easy to use and and easier to pumpi also bought a topeak alien 2 tool , twenty six tools in one , that product has been great too. highly recommended"
1,Worthless,"I saw how to get past the hurdle of having the wrong adapter as the default so that was easy. Everything else was horrible. Attaching it to the plug is hard and so much air leaks that it took about 1/2 hour to pump a tire to nearly full. Detaching it was a pain and since the parts are plastic, I can't see it taking the abuse it takes just to remove it for too many times. By the time the second tire was half full, my patience was gone. RETURNED. I'd rather have a standard full-sized pump that this frustrating gadget."
2,pump,"Got this as I had a deflated tyre. Not a good idea spent an hour pumping, the tyre was no where near inflated. It maybe good for topping up air but not good for full inflation"
2,Is this really a pump?,This is a pocket pump. Don't expect much out of it. Instructions are not properly given on how to use it. It kills a lot of time in the process. I would say it serves the purpose of a pocket pump. Compact and durable. Do not buy this if your purpose is not really to buy a compact portable pump.
2,Falls off too easily,"This comes with an attachment mechanism that screws into where the water bottle holder goes, but I've owned this for a few months now and have found that it comes off way too easily. The slightest brush of my leg on the downstroke causes it to fall off, risks jamming into my rear wheel, and makes me need to stop the bike and go get it (sometimes in traffic!). Would not recommend if you plan to attach it to your bicycle."
4,Missing Instructions . . . Read Here,"Failed to attach to my 2010 Trek 7.2 FX. Played with it a while. Unscrewed grey piece with rubber plug, flipped lever to project the inner black insert out, plucked it out, split the black insert into two, reassembled in a configuration that seemed right for the valve on my tire, reinserted and screwed they grey plug-bearing piece back on. Works like a champ!"
5,"Returning to Biking, a little tip for you all out there.","It has been roughly ten years since I last biked. Bought a cheapo bike to ease into it for getting to work, and of course, stuff starts breaking. I started buying up the essentials, and I decided on this. When I received the package this was in and tried to change the rear bike tire, there was a fair bit of frustration when I couldn't figure out how to even inflate the tube. Just take the black rubber bit that's inside the pump head and turn it around so the pointier end is outward. THEN you can fit it to the Schraeder valve that's probably more commonly seen in the bike inner tubes. Once I did that, oh, it worked beautifully. Inflated quickly and without ridiculous strain. For a first time, this worked well. Down the road, (pun intended), it remains to be seen."
5,Solid high pressure mini pump,This is a solid mini pump that I highly recommend. It can be a little tricky to get on and off the presta valve so watch your knuckles. Handles other schrader and presta valves with ease as well.
5,Great Collection,"This is a great collection that brings back memories from the past. The picture and sound quality are good, and there are SO many films on this set. Enjoy it, we do!"
3,Warning: Not all movie title sequences included,"I love the cartoons, but I was expecting all (not just some) of the movie title sequences to be included. In particular, I remember one title sequence - which started with the Pink Panther moving his rear end in time with the music - that was known at the time for being made using a very high-quality process...possibly computer animation. As such, the motion was incredibly smooth. As someone who loves animation, I was really hoping this title sequence would be included and am disappointed that it is not."
5,Cranky needs to grow up the dumbkuff!,"This collection of my friend The Pink Panther's cartoons is a must pallies. Also, if it were not for him, I would not have had my own cartoon. Que**in Taran*omo the guinea is so 1990s. These cartoons are still fresh and because this is selling, I and my friends The Tijuana Toads and Ant and the Aardvark will get our own DVDs sometime. Buy or HEEGOTCHA!"
5,funny dvd,My kid & I enjoy watching Pink Panther. This cd set is awesome. We have hours of fun watching these dvds.
5,book review,"I was a little surprised at the title of this book which seemed to indicate that Mrs. Clark had written it herself. I see that she put the stories together and must have critiqued them, but I love best those that she actually wrote. It was a good book to read however."
2,The pits,"We are all familiar with this genre of recordings: take a jazz star and have him play square with a full orchestra in order to generate sales. Jackie Gleason might have been directing this album (and he didn't even show up for his own albums). It's cruelty to the great Marshall Royal, Count Basie's right hand for so many years. It's torture for jazz lovers."
5,very professiona,excited to receive this. ordered right before thanksgiving. and came in very quickly. pot as just as described. great for pastas
3,Pot was great - lid dinged in shipment,Lid and pot were one unit and the lid shipped with a ding in it. The edge was damaged in shipping and I hoped we could return just the lid for another but we had to return the whole thing. No options to exchange just return the whole set. It was easy return via a terrific Amazon return program...just wished I could have exchanged the item without having to return and rebuy. Likely will buy or consider brand again.
1,What a piece of garbage,This is so poorly done. If you like to waste money just buy this. Absolutly Garbage and a waste of paper.
1,Do not buy,"I bought this with a rock polisher, but had horrible results for the price I spent. Not sure if it is due to the grit or the polisher itself, but the results were not what I expected."
4,A finished collection,"I had seasons 1 - 11 and needed to have the final season.I have enjoyed all, but the first seasons I liked the best with the big Kanuka."
1,Terrible scripts.,"I have only watched two episodes of season-12 so far. I have seen all the prior seasons.The problem with this season is not just a new actor replacing Danny Williams / James MacArthur. The acting of the new actors is terrible and the scripts are even more terrible. In one episode they re-use a criminal kingpin, Ross Martin, who was arrested and convicted of murder in the prior season.The actor replacing Danny Williams does not project his voice. You have to strain to hear him. Danny Williams was often serious, but was subtly expressive at key times. This new actor never expresses any emotion. A cardboard cut-out with a tape playing in the background would be more animated. The new actor would have been properly cast as a bad-guy.So far; I wish I had not bought it."
3,Just get the standard edition,"The only difference between this edition and the standard deck is a cheap, flimsy red tray. I got this version because my grandfather also owns this game, but his edition is very old (from the 60s) and the tray is firm, durable plastic (they actually made quality products years and years ago). Naturally, to save money they now provide you with a cheap plastic tray that spins (unintentionally) and slides all over the place. We don't even use the tray when we play now. If I had to make this purchase again, I would just get the deck, which is about half the price.The game itself is very fun though. It's easy to learn and very entertaining."
5,Beautiful Poster,"I originally bought this exact poster years ago in Chicago for $20.00 and over the years from moving and wear and tear, I had to part ways. I was realized to find it so much more affordable on amazons website. i just received it and I am very pleased. It is a beautiful Cuban picture ~ she reminds me of an old photograph my mother has of one her cousin from Cuba in a festival they were in. Gracias"
5,Fragrance,"This is an old favorite of mine....I saw it on amazon and it was priced right so I ordered a bottle, and it smells just like I remember."
3,whole lotta pants shaking goin on!,"This is a weird one. With songs? like ""penis and sperm"" and""too much spurt"" you'll get the gist of this one. But you cant forget the song ""lick the crack"" either. Sex Dirt is mostly the Weatherman hamming it up on the Over The Edge radio show. UsualNegativland collage with the Weatherman singing? thru-out. I love the Weatherman and N-land,but this is a harder listen and althoughfunny it gets annoying towards the end. Get Willsaphone stupid show instead. That one is my favorite."
4,Great product with a couple of irritating aspects,"I've had my Zen Touch for about two weeks now, and I love it! I'm a poor college student so the price worked for me, and I've had absolutely no problems with it. Two little irritating things though:The touchpad is super sensitive, even on the lowest setting it's still really easy to scroll over what you're looking more. But with a little practice it get easier.The software truly is crap, which is why I only gave four stars instead of five. If you're going to transfer music I would just use Windows Media Player. It's super simple and most people already know how to use it."
2,Software is abysmal,"The software that comes with the Creative Zen player is surprisingly poor. While it seems anxious to create a bunch of unwanted music libraries on your computer, it was difficult and unintuitive to do what you most need it to do- load CDs onto the MP3 player. I eventually figured it out by trial and error, but I would hate to be an unsavvy computer user trying to load up this machine.Some examples:There are no clear, simple instructions on how to get music off a CD and onto the player.There appears to be no easy way to override the ""genre"" categories provided by the ""Gracenote"" service. And their categories are often absurd. (I have 3 albums by Beck, and each was given a different category: Folk-rock, General Alternative, and Indie.)There is no easy way to put all the tracks from a multiple-CD album into one album on the MP3 player.I haven't had the machine long enough to comment on its operation."
1,Don't touch this piece of crap.,Got it on Christmas... it's the 29th... I turned it on... it froze. Messed with the battery... turns off. Turn it on... freezes. Get an iPod.
4,Creative Zen Touch 20 GB MP3 Player,very good player... only 4 stars because the touch panel.. have much sensitivity... but the sound quality and all the others things are perfect.. nomad explorer.. great software... just drag and drop... very nice
3,Amateurs Beware!!,"This mp3 player has NO instructions I could find on how to import songs from your playlist to your mp3 player. Instructions on doing this should be one of the first things listed in the manual. I am not a computer amateur and this was difficult for me, so tech amateurs beware. Also, the software automatically downloads AOL on your computer. I hate this! The design is horrible on this mp3 player. There is a reason it costs only $200 dollars."
2,DO NOT BUY,This sounded like a good deal when i bought it a year ago. now today i am on here getting ready to buy a new one becuse the touch pad in mine has decided that it dose not want to work and the buttons are not working this is a peice of junk and i would not reccomend it to anyone. of course if u think it is a good thing then here are a few good things.Pros-1.Holds alot of music2.Long Battery life3.Good SoundCons-Buttons Wear OutThe Screen Gets Dust Under It Making It Hard To ReadThe Touch Pad is Sentive even on lowIt Eventualy Kicks hte bucket it seems like after a yea by most standards
1,Don't waste your time - mine broke after 3 days.,"I just received mine in the mail last Friday (3 days ago), and the hard drive just died. Upon calling Tech Support, I was informed that this is not an uncommon problem, and that they also do not claim liability for lost files - a fact which is not listed in the EULA, but on an obscure page on Creative's website. So, I made the mistake of deleting most of my music off my hard drive, and now it's gone forever. Thanks, Creative! Go get an iPod - I am."
1,Problems with player,"I bought this player instead of an iRiver H120 (not made anymore)it worked excellently, until it started freezingthe reset button on the player worked, but it kept on freezing, and I eventually got fed up and am trying to return it for a full refund."
2,Will not buy agin from Creative,"I purchased the Zen Touch 20GB about 2 yrs ago. I liked it becuase it had a large hardrive with large screen, but felt it was bulky and heavy compared to other iPods. After 1 1/2, the screen froze so I had to take the cover off to unhook the cable connected to harddrive to unfreeze the screen. I had to do this several times to make it work. It is probably going to the trash since the scroll pad does not work anymore. I wondering if this is even fixable or does Creative take back the player and fix it for you although the screw at the bottom of the player has been tampered with? I purchase the Apple Nano about 1 year ago and happy with it becuase it thin, light, and it has color screen. In my opinion I recommend Apple rather than Creative."
5,nothing bad to say,"i got my creative as a present and have been using it for about a year. i thought i would have tons of songs, but my 400 are like a pinprick to a 20GB player, and it's really really easy to use, even while driving (which i don't recommend anyway, b/c it's obviously still a little distracting). plus, the creative mediasource organizer is really user friendly. i usually just play one of my playlist (which are simple to make - i have about 10) or hit the random button to mix it up a little. i'd really recommend it to anyone who wants all their music at their fingertips."
4,I guess its good,"..I had this device for 6months and the headphone jack suddenly shorted out. No sound is coming through the headphones. at first i thought it was the headphones but later found out that it was the device. Besides that this is a great mp3 for a great price. the sound is amazing. alot of people complain that it is to thick (compared to the new ipod video it is enormus). however it is very durable. I droup this device multiple times and it has yet to crack. The software is excellent. far better than the ipod's. You dont have to convert the songs to any other format. just transfer them straight from your computer to the device. it takes about 2seconds to put a song on (very fast). this is a great mp3 player, however it is outdated, we are now in the age of colored players. but if none of that matters to you and if the size doesn't matter to you. I highly reccomend this product."
3,"Good for students, less for real world",Many pages spent in academic formulas make this book good for students only.
3,"Easy to Use, But Not the Greatest Product","I have tried several recipes with mixed results, and although I love not having to freeze a bowl, I don't feel that this machine makes ice cream with as satisfying a texture to me as my old non-compressor Donvier (or ice and rock salt for that matter). The eggless recipe in the instruction booklet especially creates a product with a strange mouth-feel which coats your spoon as well as your tongue. I haven't been able to sample any ice cream made from more expensive compressor models, so I can't make any comparison there. By far the worst aspect of this machine is the annoying, brain-jangling noise it makes - a Ferrari it ain't. I live in an apartment with an open kitchen and have to put it in the bathroom with the door closed to run it if I don't want to be driven to the brink of insanity."
1,Very disappointed,"My husband bought this machine from Williams Sonoma, and gave it to the family to use. Our first time to use it we decided on Chocolate frozen yogurt. It is a very noisy machine, and even after putting the mixture through two cycles, it was soupy at best. We were hoping to have it at a soft serve consistency after a cycle, but were very disappointed. It has gone into the freezer, and we are still waiting for it to freeze up. First experience, not good!"
1,Pure Junk,"Received this on 8-8-2011, took out of box, like other people said cheaply made for the price. Put it together poured cold water from refrigerator into can and started about 15 to 20 minutes dasher stopped and would not turn. This was the second type of ice cream maker I purchased in the past week. I was totally disgusted, cleaned and re-packed into box and made ready to take to UPS for return on 8-9-2011. Done with home self contained compressor units just not good enough with cheap price to work correctly."
5,Wow What a Unit,This was a great purchase. The unit works well although it is a bit loud while it is making good ice cream. The unit is easy to use and makes good ice cream. I have had this unit over a year and it works well every time. Well worth the money!!
4,Love the cuisinart ICE-50BC ice cream maker,"This is a great machine took a little getting used to how to assemble the beater & lid. It is loud but so is my cuisinart blender. The recipe book is good I recommend using eggs in the ice cream though just buy free range eggs from someone you know & put two eggs in the recipes. I've learned to use cocoa powder for the chocolate ice cream instead of having to melt the baking choc. bars. My family loves it & it is easier, just put a little veg oil in with it so the ice cream doesn't get so hard.I bought the Ben & Jerry ice cream book also & I like that."
3,Everyone is loving the ice cream!,"Unfortunately, the cover to the machine is already broken. IT is very awkward to get the pieces to fit properly. When I tried to put the plastic cover on, two pieces snapped off. The machine is noisy but makes delicious ice cream. It's not hard to do either. After it is processed, it definitely needs to go in the freezer for a few hours otherwise I find it to be too soft."
4,Don't listen the the negative people,"The negative people here, specifically Jane Palmer don't have a clue as to how to use this wonderful machine. Have enjoyed mine for a year and it has never failed. Chances are that she simply did not assemble the arm correctly. The churn stops automatically once the ice cream comes to a thick viscosity, as it should. THen you transfer it to a container and put it in your freezer for the final freeze. If you prefer soft serve, you are ready right out of the bucket. Yes it's loud. I keep mine in the laundry room and just close the doors. I would buy it again. People complain about things when they just don't use then correctly or take the time to learn about them. Good unit. Very happy with it after a full year.."
2,"Cheaply made, very small ice cream container","This is my third Cuisinart ice cream maker. The first one was the best, as it was well built and lasted for many years. I thought it was a sure thing with this model, but I was very disappointed when I first used it. First off, the ice cream container is very small, so you can only make about a pint at one time; my other models enabled you to make at least two pints at a time. Second, I found it very difficult to get the cannister to lock into place properly with the plastic churn. Last but not least, the churn did not turn at all. The only plus was that the ice cream was ready after only 15 minutes, even with the churning mechanism not working. I am returning this ASAP and will continue my search for a decent machine."
2,"True Cussler, but disappointing","Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of ""Raise the Titanic"", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent.Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved.Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one."
2,Polar Shift,"Would someone PLEASE tell Mr. Cussler's writing staff and editors that ""antennas"" is the plural for more than one radio frequency receiving antenna and that ""antannae"" are the feelers found on insect heads. I get so tired of seeing the miswording used."
2,Quick Review,"Anarchists want to use experimental technology to cause a shift in the Earth's North and South poles, and it's up to Kurt Austin and NUMA to save the day. I haven't read much of Cussler, but what I have read has been utterly ridiculous. But, they have also been light and easy reading. The same holds true for ""Polar Shift""."
4,Excellent Player!,"When I purchased this CD player, I was just expecting it to be another average player with o.k. sound. But when I began listening, I discovered how wrong I was. This player has such great sound quality, it almost sounds like you are at a live concert! ALso, the G-Protection is absolutelyl amazing. You could play football with tis thing and it still wouldnt skip. This player also has an exceptionally long battery life (that is compared to may standards. Although you may not want to take my word for this because I myself have only owned two players). It is also great that with MP3 files, you can fit about 200 songs on a single CD so you barelly ever have to change CDs. The only reason why I wouldn't rate this player 5 stars is because... it is a little on the pricey side, and that means that I had to clean quite a few more bathrooms. Overall, this is an extrordinary player."
5,Great Player!!,I had a Rio 600 before this but expanding the 32MB memory backpack was too expensive. This thing is the ticket though for long play. I have 186 mp3s on one cd and hardly ever have to swap it at work. Battery life is great! I plan on getting a 4V adapter to save on buying batteries anyway. Not sure what else you could want in a player since it does most everything for [money].I hightly recommend it. I think the folder problem can be avoided if you name you mp3s correctly. One more cool feature is it will scroll on any ID tag you want. I think there are 3 or 4 tags. So you can just scroll the name of the song or folder or album..etc...kinda nice instead of waiting for the whole title to scroll.
2,Bad for beginners,"This book is usually best for plaers who own nylons or acoustics. When I read the basics it didn't make senese. This book isn't ver good for beginners, because first of all it doesn't explain the basics very well, and it is more focused much more in more complicated songs and styles of music than basics for a complete begginer. This book would be better for a more experienced player and it is more a reference book."
3,Okay...,"So I tutor music theory and fundamentals, and I like to use these ""Idiot's Guides"" for my students. The books generally give a good overview of history, practice, basic knowledge, and some harder stuff.This one those is one of the weaker of the guides that I have tried out. The practices are limited and really try to force you into a mold of playing style, instead of fundamentals and technique that other books will give you.There is a good amount of knowledge contained in the pages and let me tell you, it is by far not the worst book on learning guitar you can get, but also, it is nowhere near the best.For a good price, give it a shot. The teaching methods might work better for you than it did for my mentoring style."
2,Just designing theories!,This book depends on designing theories more than real designing practice which is the most important way to be good designer. It is very dry and boring and if you are beginner don't bother your self much with this book.
2,odd,"i've used it before and loved it. now, all of a sudden i'm allergic to it. my face was so itchy."
3,Not for the average fan of Italian cuisine,"I'm quoting the review by B. Marold: ""So, here I am to say that there is much of value here for the foodie and the professional cook. For all you casual cookbook clients out there, you may want to give this one a pass."" Read his review if you want more information."
2,Crush by BonJovi,"To say that ""Crush"" was disappointing is an understatement. It was not at all what I expected from BonJovi, their previous albums all had a definite sound and original style to them but this time they seem to have abandoned it all. While there are songs that stick out, ""It's My Life"" for example, for the most part this album simply blended with most of the CD's that are currently out on the market. Frankly the music industry does not need another BSB group. BonJovi should have stuck to its own original style and sound and not tried to blend with the meaningless dribble that pollutes the airwaves today."
4,works exactly the way I wanted it to,I ordered this along with my Cuisinart SmartStick blender. The blender comes with a 2-cup beaker and I wanted something additional in a similar shape (more tall than wide) at about twice that size. This 50 oz pitcher is the perfect size and shape for small batches of hummus or pesto.The fact that it's stainless is perfect -- no chemical leaching issues (presumably - I don't store anything in this pitcher long-term) and not breakable (as glass could be with a blender inside it!). The handle makes it very easy to use with the stick blender.It's a good weight. It could stand to be a tiny bit thicker gauge stainless but it's really fine.If there's a negative it's that it seems to be a little bit cheaply made. Guess that isn't too surprising since the price is low. Hard to describe but I won't be surprised if the stainless on the inside becomes pitted over time.
1,Read better books after this step,"Dinosaurs before Dark put me to sleep in five minutes. How bad can this get? I'm sure this an awesome stepping stone book for first-second graders who are just starting to read. But once you get to third grade and beyond you should read things like Lord of the Rings and Ramona Quimby. I'm in fifth grade and I still read these books to my sister, and sure enough, it puts her to sleep! There are so many simple words that take up so many lines that if you took them out it would make the story several pages shorter. After all, how is""Yeah,sure."" she said.supposed to be exciting. Take a good lleap once in third grade and start reading nice 200-500 page books. Grab a nice Sammy Keyes or a pleasant classic like the Secret Garden(boys too!)So, my overall rating sure can not get much better than one star, (if any stars at all).I'M A BOY, NOT A GIRL!!!!!!!!"
4,It was good,"I love these books.But the only thing is the [unsafe] Annie!! She is [unsafe] b/c she pets predators.And she has no idea what on earth shes doing. Other than that, they are educational and good for kids. They educate in a fun way."
5,A fun book.,"My dad and I liked this book because it was exciting and made us feel like we were traveling through time. My friends in the first grade like the Magic Tree House series, and we highly recommend them."
5,"Dinosaurs Before Dark (Magic Tree House, No. 1)","It has been a joy to read my daughter and I together the book. As English is my second language, it is really convenient to have the Book & CD). My daughter loves this book and I think we are going to continue with the collection of this serie of books."
3,I think the book is too old !,"I read the book in 2000,but this book was published in 1995. There are a lot of ideas not match today. But, this is not mean the book too old to read. I suggest if you have experiences about EC, you could read this book to rethink your step is correct or wrong. But, if your are a new person who want understand what EC is.the book maybe not good for you."
4,Best Practice for Internal Med Shelf,"Please note that MKSAP 3 it out. That said, I didn't feel the info in MKSAP 2 was outdated, and moreover the questions are different from MKSAP 3. There were several things I liked about MKSAP. It covered a variety of illnesses and grouped them by symptom (so if you felt weak in pulmonary you could easily find sections applicable to that field). The American College of Physicians wrote it, which is quite comforting. It references appropriate research articles for every Q&A. Also, like a shelf, it forced you to make tough decisions. In reality, you order just above every lab and whatever imaging you need to cover yourself. Board questions, though, make you choose the best test from what you would always order. I preferred using the CD-ROM with the book (well made) as I could do questions much faster rather than flipping through a book. One slight criticism was the seeming repetition of certain concepts (asthma treatment protocols)."
5,I LOVED IT,"After reading what turned out to be a ""sexed up"" Pride & Prejudice ""pseudo-sequel"" (that I frankly found an insult to Miss Austin's legacy) I found this author's efforts balm for the soul. Although not written in the same lovely 19th century prose Miss Austin so eloquently commanded, Miss Collins' slightly more modern voice provides a comfortable transition from the original, and was an enjoyable reading experience. The story continues with both happy and sad times experienced by the characters, and I thought the plot to be deftly handled. I enjoyed it enough to read the second in the series - ""The Women of Pemberley"" - which I discovered to be also well crafted, and plan to keep going through all 10 books in the series, so long as the quality remains this good!"
2,One of the worst series I have read. There are better fanfiction out there,I love sequels to pride and prejudice and own many of them. I purchased this book along with five others when she was first self publishing them.To me I felt like I had entered a history book with our beloved characters added and was sorry that I had purchased them. If you do read them my advice is to make a family tree for you to follow as there is such a lot of intermarrying and you can get lost. (cousins marrying cousins etc)The first book in the series is quite good at first but the rest are terrible and a waste of money in my opinion.She pretends to be Charlotte Collins eldest daughter giving a fly on the wall story for all to read. I cannot recommend any of the books except the first.
4,More depth,"I enjoyed this book immensely when I read it. If you just want a quick P&P romance, variation, or sequel you won't get it here. This novel is carefully thought out with lots of attention to detail. The historical avenues discussed add a richness to the sequel. If, however, you are more in the mood for a light fluffy sequel then save this book for a different day. Several of the others in this series deal with persons originally mentioned in this book but in lieu of rating each I'll just say that my ratings were more 3's than 4's. The characters developed are good just not Darcy and Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy's Daughter was my favorite of all the many others (after this one)."
3,A Detailed History - Sometimes Too Detailed,"One of the things I appreciated the most about this was that it was a clean continuation with no language or sexual content. Reading in detail about Darcy & Elizabeth's sex life (as some of the other continuations are basically glorified bodice rippers) is completely disgusting to me, and so I appreciated that Ms. Collins did not take this book in that direction.I enjoyed reading the histories of the Pemberley families, mainly the Darcys, the Bingleys, and the Gardiners, and the story was well written. However, there was a bit too much information at times. With all the children and grandchildren appearing throughout the story, I quickly lost count of which family they belonged to. Some may not enjoy reading about the social-political climate of the day, but I thought it was very interesting.There are more books in the series and I plan to read them as well."
3,Only Rehased Faces on the Bread Line Tonight.,"For the most part all of the songs on this ""Purple Tape"" extract have seen the light of day over the course of the Pixies offical albums. These demos are, as usually is the case with demos, inferior to their finely polished later versions. And quite frankly, the ""new"" song was probably better off left in the vault.So, why 3 stars do you ask? Why not one star? Simply because any true Pixies fan will absolutely need this album in their collection. There are some interesting differences between a few of the demos and album versions, and, for me, the Pixies original version of David Lynchs ""In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)"" is worth the price of admission alone."
3,Good display case,"I like the case but my 3 stars is due to the fact that is not an acrylic made and also it came broken, therefore you'll have to be very careful handing it to avoid breaking it."
2,Shame,"The name for this book is Watlala, the name of my people. We lived at the place where niftyungi (mount Hood to those who do not know) and the columbia river come together. The picture on the front of this book clearly shows someone who did not live in the columbia river area and the story is full of lies as to the artwork and living style presented. Shame!"
2,Stopped Working X2,"We purchased this game for my son's birthday. Wish I would have read the reviews on here first. We all had quite a bit of fun with the game, but it stopped working after about 1/2 hour of play. I called the manufacturer the next day and they offered to send out a replacement. The person I spoke to on the phone said that I was the first one to call in with this problem. The second one arrived today... Well, my 4 year old was playing with it at the kitchen table while I was cooking supper. It stopped working! UNBELIEVABLE!! Well, my son is now very upset, asking if I still love him, etc. He thinks he broke this thing twice. He was hitting it with the mallet... but isn't that the whole idea? It did not get dropped, thrown or anything like that. I guess we will be returning it and getting a different toy. Too bad, it was pretty fun while it lasted."
1,Brother Drum Replacement,I am waiting for a replacement. THe drum I received has loud clicks when priniting.
4,book,i have browsed through this book and it appears to have some good ideas for redoing things i have found or will find for repurposing..have not actually read everything yet
4,Clever Crafting with Flea Market Finds,I just love these type of books. It really gets me excited to get started on some new projects.
4,Simply Good,"For those who've consciously been searching for themselves for some time now, the message of this book is oft-heard and come across. Oh, don't get me wrong; it's all good advice, but rather more like a set of reminders that we've already heard before.But for those who are only now beginning to go within for answers, I strongly recommend this book. It's very easy to follow--so easy in fact that you're likely to think, ""Yeah, I've known that all along, but never tried it. It's about time I did!"" This little volume is a gem of a handbook about life."
5,True story about the book,"A friend in the middle of an excruciating divorce read the book.She was so moved she loaned the book to their marriage counselor, who was so moved that she insisted that the battling husband read the book. He was so moved that he wrote his wife a letter!. And now they are back together again and very happy! IF LIFE IS A GAME, THESE ARE THE RULES saved this marriage. It can save your life."
2,It's not what you may think.,Beautiful picture but if your looking for a how-to book save your money. I bought all three and it's not what I needed. If you want to go up that next step in modeling look elsewhere.
2,Mediocre meeting,"Occasionally Fennesz's hazy embellishments will intoxicatingly mesh with Sakamoto's minor melodies, but for the most part just sounds like two pretentious artists mildly engaging each other's whims."
4,Really helped,I had tendonitis in my knee. It was very painful. This wrap provided support but was not too tight.. I would recommend it.
3,Fun but not fabulous,"I didn't expect to get much more out of this novel than brain candy, which is a good thing, because that is exactly what it is. The story itself was engaging and interesting. The plot concepts and world cultures were reasonably original. However, overall the book suffers from a lack of depth. The characters are a bit two dimensional, there are plot holes left unaddressed and yet the ending leaves it wide open for sequels. This is one of those books that couldn't decide if it wants to be fantasy or romance and so it vacillates oddly and unsatisfying-ly between both. Overall, a pleasant enough diversion that might cause me to buy the probably inevitable sequel novels, but I definitely wouldn't care if I missed reading them."
3,The Lawmen,This book was OK. I read a lot of westerns and this one is about average. Just about right in length.
5,Great Summary of Positive Psychology,"I've read several books on Positive Psychology now, and this book is a great summary of all the information out there. While other books jump around from all the applications for positive psychology, Daniel presents the thesis in a logical pattern, taking the reader from thought to thought in several Aha moments. The book is so fluid I read it in one day. The only portion I found disagreeable was the section on drugs, mostly because this smacked of the ""bad old days"" before positive psychology came on the scene.This is not a self-help book, but for those who want a little insight into our human condition it can be illuminating. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wonders what they're thinking."
4,"good, inexpensive player","I have only had this thing for a week, so I cannot write about its longevity. So far the thing is working flawlessly. The PAL->NTSC conversion is excellent, something that my $700 Pioneer Elite player doesn't seem to be able to do.The reasons I downgraded this player to 4 stars:- Only COMPOSITE video out (no S-video or component). The picture quality is still decent, though a bit washed out looking, even after making adjustments.- Bright red light stays on when disc is inside player and player is turned off. This is an annoyance if you have your player in a bedroom system. (The red light is BRIGHT!)- Seems to have some relatively minor lip-sync issues.For the money, this is a great little player."
4,GREAT ACTION COMEDY ROMANCE THRILLER,"""THE STUNT MAN"" a bona fide cult-fave starring Peter O'Toole finally makes it's digital appearance in a sharp looking transfer. Steve Railsback is a Vietnam vet on the lam who literally falls into, and becomes a stunt man, in the make-believe world of a war film directed by the diabolically manipulative O'toole. Barbara Hershey is the ""actress"" he falls in love with on screen and off. But what's real and what's not becomes a twisting labyrinth of perception and deception in this surprising roller-coaster comedic action thriller. There's enthusiastic commentary from co-writer director Richard Rush, O'Toole, Railsback and Hershey, deleted scenes and in DVD-ROM there's a complete screenplay with director's notes. A cool movie that taps into the ""Matrix"" mind set of multilayered realities and the problems of being a hero in real life, whatever that is."
2,Not for regular viewers,"Just as engineers design products to impress other engineers (like the unwieldy push-button gear shift on late model Mercedes cars), this movie was made by movie-making people for movie-making people and critics. A ""normal"" viewer is alternately confused and bored by a plot that moves into another plot and alternates reality with fantasy. No doubt elite purists, and even ordinary viewers, will admire O'Toole's exceptional talent that could have been utilized infinitely better."
5,"Excellent acting, plot make for an engrossing film.","Peter O'Toole, Barbara Hershey and Steve Railsback are superb in this movie. Railsback is a Vietnam vet who accidently kills a copy and stumble upon a WW I movie being shot by O'Toole, who plays the director. After his stunt man is killed, O'Toole blackmails Railsback into becoming his stunt man, and Railsback thinks O'Toole is trying to kill him.Barbara Hershey as Railsback love interest looks gorgeous. O'Toole is amazing. Not your usual, predictable Hollywood plot. A very special movie worth owning for repeat viewing."
5,The best movie I've seen in the last 20 years. Awesome!,"No one ever since was able to achieve the level of filmmaking equal to what Richard Rush did in his Stunt Man. He is the most neglected director in Hollywood in the last twenty years. I wish those studio types realise it now and let him do something more decent than lame shlock of ""The color of the night"""
3,Okay,"This book was okay, not great, not wonderful, just OK!Definitely not on the same realm as some other Christian Chick Lit books that I have loved (Lisa Samson's, Laura Jensen Walker, Rene Gutteridge, Robert Elmer, Kristin Billerbeck, Meredith Efken, Neta Jackson, Judy Baer, etc.)It just doesn't have the quality of writting that I look for. The editing is also very poor. Many typos and errors.I don't think too much of Steeple Hill Cafe books so far. This is a huge disappointment to me, I had so looked forward to this new line....but they just aren't delivering!At least this one is not as big a flop as ""Mother of Prevention.""This is another book going straight to paperbackswap.com!"
5,Fascinating and educational,"This is the most fascinating book you'll ever read about sleep. You won't be able to put it down. It is really a book for all ages. The illustrations are fun. The information is, what's that word again, ""fascinating"". Ever think of milk as helping you sleep, well if you drank 30 glasses, maybe! If you live to be 70 you'll have spent 23 years sleeping. Mozart was inspired by the music he heard in his dreams. Birds take mini-naps of 30 seconds or so while flying. That's how they can fly non-stop during long migrations. Albert Einstein was at his best when he slept 10 hours a day. Winston Churchill did almost the opposite. Giraffes and elephants need 3 hours of sleep; cats need 16 and bats need 20 hours. What is the record for staying awake the longest? Read the book; its fascinating."
3,its mainstream drum,"i liked the album it reminds me of the jungle i used to hear at a club called missions on south beach fl it wasn t the greatest club but this isn t the greatest album its an album of personal memories for me, but for everyone else its mainstream jungle nothing original just added"
1,DON'T BUT THIS PRODUCT,"Mattress is extremely poor quality, foam has been allowed to bend into shapes which DO NOT lie flat. Exterior ""waterproof cover"" was damaged in several places The cover looks and feels like white saran wrap. Shipment packaging of this mattress consisted of a tube of cardboard with ends unsealed. The product was vsible when delivered. The mattress was folded in the middle in too small of a box.VERY DISAPPOINTED"
4,poker chips,"good set of chips for playing cards or board games.made well, like the tray to hold them. Happy playing everyone."
5,My rating for Sylvania 20673 26-watt compact flourescent 4 pin Double Tube,I wish he had more to sell he only had two of them. It is exactly what I was looking for.
3,Panasonic KXTG2000B,So far so good after 2 weeks of use. Some static problems with the handset which seemed to fix themselves. I am a little concerned about the battery life in the handset and am trying to use the charge up completely before placing it in the recharger as it says in the manual. Of course in an office situation that doesn't always work and I sometimes pick it up in the morning and find it has no charge which means I can't use it for 8 hours..... Thankfully I have the main base handset as a backup.I am getting a battery light on the base station that stays on all of the time. Maybe that just means that the battery in the main base unit is charged. It does not explain that in the guide.After looking at all of my options before buying this phone it seems Panasonic could fix most of their problems by using batteries with memory..... Most people have old Panasonic phones that they love and can't work out why the new versions have older technology.
3,"NICE PHONE, BUT COULD OF ADDED A FEW MORE FEATURES","I HAVE THE 4 LINE SYSTEM, WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS, WHEN THE OPERATOR IS ON A CALL WHY IS THAT PHONE BUSY WHEN OTHER CALLS COME THRU, NO MATTER IF IT IS AN EXTENTION CALLING OR SOMEONE WHO HAS PRESSED 0# FOR THE OPERATOR......ISNT AN OPERATOR SUPPOSE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE MULTIPLE CALLS???ALSO, WHEN THE AUTO ATTENDANT IS ACTIVE AND A CALLER WHO DOESNT HAVE A TOUCHTONE PHONE IS ONLY ABLE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE, THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BE TRANSFERED TO A LIVE PERSON.......HOPE THIS HELPS SOME OF YOU,"
1,Panasonic dropped the ball with this one!,"The bottom line is, 90% of us purchased this phone for the ""auto-attendant"" feature. Unfortunately, Panasonic skimped on everything in this area. The auto-attendant functionality is basic, bare-bones, and completely unconfigurable.The only thing you can change is the general greeting message and the mailbox messages. YOU CAN'T set your own extention numbers, define how many rings to allow before picking up, set to go to mail box automatically if there's no answer, etc, etc, etc.If all you really need is a multi-line phone with answering machine, look elsewhere, there are far better phones for 1/3 the price. If you need the auto-attendant functionality, this is unfortunatly the only phone available short of purchasing a more expensive PBX system. If you want an idea of how limited this system is: go to Panasonic's web site and download the product manual PDF from the support section."
4,Solved part of the Battery Problem!,"I have had this unit for less than one year. I love the unit's features and sound quality. I also had the battery difficulty. I had to replace the base unit battery in the first few months. I chalked it up to bad luck. However, during the last few weeks both handsets could not hold a charge. I too, had difficulty getting the batteries on a retail basis, so I looked up inventory on Panasonic. Their website told me they were out of stock. As you can image, I was a little peeved. I called their customer service department and after 10 minutes, they admitted that they were having difficulty with some of the products. Evidently, they had subcontracted some of their battery work and those batteries were BAD. She also admitted that their inventory levels on the website are not always correct - can you image that? They are sending me TWO batteries - one for each phone. I hope this information helps you get the results you need."
2,I guess it is a guide.,"I guess I was expecting something with more useful information (namely the 'why' for each of the items listed. This book is what it claims to be...a guide. It does break the supermarket down into fairly narrow categories and lists the acceptable and the unacceptable. In reality, it is a book of lists. Considering the price, it is a reasonable supplement to the Sugur Busters book."
5,Sugar Busters works!,"The shoppers guide is very easy to follow. It also explains how Sugar Busters works, how to read labels, and is very specific on what foods are unacceptable. I can say it has worked for me for weight loss; but this is not a fad diet, it is a lifestyle change you have to stick with if you want to keep the weight off."
1,HYPOCRISY & SCANDAL,"If today's media reports are true (innocent until proven guilty & all that...): How sad - another 'icon' takes a plunge, having been exposed as a phony [...] he can get from schmucks like you & me buying his 'inspirational' books for dog lovers. According to reports, this author, who claims to be sensitive to the plight of mistreated animals, LIVES WITH ANIMALS PERMANENTLY CRATED, well, read the news reports. I can't write more withoput crying."
2,Empty and derivative,"Battlechasers is essentially an amalgam of things considered cool by the creator, Joe Madureira. The story is straight out of a AD&D module (he is after all, a self-confessed AD&D fan), the characters are straight out a geek's wet dream. The art is, though cartoony, is detailed and flashy but it doesn't contribute much to storytelling (if there was any story to begin with) since Madureira has filled it with endless posturings and fights. Borrow it if you can, since it's quick, fun read but do not waste your money buying this. Besides, Madureira never got to put an issue on time, never got to conclude the story arc in this collection and was ultimately cancelled. I guess that's why it's under the imprint Cliffhanger."
5,LEMON PIPERS BEST OF,"Good collection from this one hit wonder group,features their smash song green tambourine.Also features their other singles they released plus b sides and a few album tracks and a couple of psychedelic tracks they wrote themselves.Remastered well with colorful packaging short bio on the group, but sadly no pictures in inlay.A part from this just another one of their compilations with not much more variation on the songs compiled."
2,Nice features bad sound quality,"I was prepared to exchange this phone for another - but having read the reviews it seems I'm not alone in believing the phone has poor sound quality with the handset. Call ID seems to work fine as do the two lines ... I also have a Uniden 900 Mhz spread spectrum phone that works much better - features aren't as nice on the Uniden, though."
4,A great period movie for it's time.,"After seeing this movie with my kids, i was proud of the thoughful acting and humor that was used to create this movie in 1936. it would behoove film makers of this day to review older films and realize that simplicity is always the key in telling a story."
2,POOR Servicer Used book sold as new - 1 Day shipping took 5 days,The book itself is a good reference tool and is a good choice for a student and a practitioner looking for a foundation and advice on basic computer forensics. Unfortunately I bought a NEW book from an authorized AMAZON re-seller and what I got was a USED book that has been marked up in pen. I also paid for 1 day shipping as I needed the book immediately but the book was sent by UPS Ground and took 5 days. I've disputed this but its been a month now and the dispute has not been resolved. BUYERS beware! Maybe someone ar AMAZON will read this review and realize that they need to stand behind their products and services! My overall rating of the book is OK - my rating for AMAZON and the re-seller is POOR.
3,Very Skagen,"I got this watch about 8 months ago. Just like other Skagen watches, the design is great. I received many compliments. If your only concern is its beauty, this is a great buy. Unfortunately, Skagen watch is also known for its fragility. In less than 8 months of occasional use, the watch band started falling apart in multiple places for no apparent reason. If you decide to buy this watch, make sure you keep the receipt because it's very possible that you have to send it back for repair."
4,fun but not for long,"more fun for adults than other kids games, pegs in the park helps kids learn addresses and phone numbers and some other stuff. very simple to play and some fun for all, i found the pieces help up to kid level abuse, such as throwing, biting etc. the only drawback was that after awhile they lost interest in the game and moved on to other things."
3,insane,"I wrote one half of this double novella and Jason Rogers, who is insane, wrote the other half. So is his writing. It's more a work of art in the form of words than it is a linear story. Either way, he is a lunatic and a terrorist of the written word, although my half of the book is better.I had to give the book a rating to say this, so I am giving it a three because of my obvious bias"
5,Very nice,"I ordered this for my sister's birthday, it came in on time and the item itself is very nice."
4,A Good Beginning,Nakamura is part of a movement that takes cybercultural studies past utopia and dystopia and describes how categories of race and identity work within this new ontological plane.Although the language is highly technical (accessable mainly to students of cultural studies and more specifically critical theory) the book can also be useful for those more adventurous readers who are willing to tough out an interesting book in order to learn a little bit more about the world they live in.Daniel Clausendaniel clausen dot com
4,Always use Brother Manufactured Ink.,"I always purchase Brother manufactured ink. It may cost a little more than the no-name brand, but you never have ANY problems with it!"
1,WARNING,WARNING. Amazon has this listed as a cartridge for the HL2070N Printer. IT IS NOT!!!It is right there on the HL-2070N page. I have been trying to get a refund from Amazon and they were supposed to send me a return shipping label in the mail but 1 week later no label.
1,This toner doesnt work well at all - ink stains everywhere!!,So you try to save money and end up costing you more in time and effort....well it just doesnt work so dont buy it. What else can I say.
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased the TonerPals TN360 Compatible High Yield Black Toner Cartridge and it felt like I made 30 copies and and I noticed on the Brother Copier it has already said Low Ink Cartridge, I thought I was getting a good deal but this is a Total Rip Off next time you need a ink cartridge try best buy or whatever company this is a learning experience on how i was ripped OFF."
4,"Long Life, No Recycle Label","This toner cartridge is for our Brother Intellifax 4100e fax machine. The cartridges last a very long time, as promised, and are dependable and relatively easy to replace. (Just follow the instructions carefully.) My only complaint is the lack of a recycling label to ship it back to Brother. HP always has a return label for returning their toner cartridges free of charge, and I'm disappointed that Brother does not."
5,stroszek,"A wonderful look into european vs. american culture and attitudes, stellar imagery and characters, its like your seeing the whole thing happening for real...they have turned it into a theatre production, it opens in texas at the end of february!"
5,We were pleasantly surprised...,"We had researched many different cordless phones with these features and were set on this one. Once we read the reviews of several people...we were hesitant. We also read reveiews on other phones with similar features that were more costly and most of them also had complaints so we decided to give it a try anyway. We are very pleased. We did find the base ringer loud so we turned it off. The handset ringer was sufficient since there are other lines in the home. The three mailboxes work beautifully for child, parents and small business..."
5,A really nice phone,"Contrary to the first reviewer, I don't think that this phone is heavy, bulky or uncomfortable to hold in the least. I compared it's weight to a Panisonic that I own and I couldn't distinguish any difference. The tones are a little on the loud side when you are dialing, but it really isn't that bad. It has many useful features and a nice design. Also, this phone allows me to wander an absurd distance before it loses its signal."
3,Not same as before,"I first tried the Zum Frankincense hand soap in 2005. Since then the formula has changed. It is now much more watered down and does not feel the same as before. I wish they would return to their original formula (or cleanse the manufacturing facilities to make it feel the same as before). I like the fragrance and it doesn't suck, but its not the same as before."
5,One of my most utilized cookbooks,"This cookbooks provides you with the recipes from the entire year of Marta Stewart Living magazines. Since I have used many of those recipes from her magazine, I found having them all compiled in one volume much more convenient (even though I have every issue the book covers).For rave reviews, try the guacamole recipe. It is by far the top requested item for me to bring to a gathering!Overall, a great book."
3,"Great Puzzles, Received the wrong titles","I love the Hometown Collection puzzles. However, I (just like another reveiwer)did not receive the titles in the produrct description (Venice Boat Parade, Winter in New England, Changing of the Guard, Driving the Gold Spike, Drive in Theater, At the Lake). I wouldnt mind but I already owned most the titles sent to me. FYI I received Kite Flying at Recess, Ladies of Lancaster, Tending to the Garden, Outing at the Light, Castle Drive, Los Altos Train Station."
5,Indispensible for serious study,"A collection of primary documents concerning the revolt of 1381. Dobson's collection and informative introduction are the starting points for any serious analysis of the events of 1381. Also included, a useful extended bibliography. A must for any student of the revolt."
2,"Reflectors are supposed to reflect, aren't they?","This ""reflector"" doesn't reflect. It only vaguely glows in bright headlights. Looks nice in the daytime, though. Only blue reflector that I was able to find."
5,excellent,"great product, received on time. will order from you again! Was a gift for xmas and they loved it. Thank You"
3,"has a lot historycal errors,","The writter lacks of the knowledge of the industry in Cuba,the people interviewed are in the majority employees of the same firm in Pre-Castro Cuba, mainly the book is a ""propaganda"" to Goar Mestre, a Cuban Zar of Cuba's Radio and Television."
4,three sister ... three weddings ... one day,"This is a romantic comedy and it is full of witty and funny scenes. The three sisters are quite different but when they get together they click well. Also their boyfriends are just as different as the sisters are. A good family movie, or a pre-nuptial date movie."
2,Not like new,This was a used book described as like new but it looked very used especially the cover which was bent and folded.
2,Girls Night In,"Benefitting War Child, a charity to help kids hurt by war, this anthology brings together the queens of the chick lit world across publisher lines. Some stories play off of their author's past work, others stand alone. By turns they are funny, witty, or depressing. The best advice is to read backwards, if you want to save the best for last, Meg Cabot's entry. If you are a fan of the genre, indulge yourself and help someone doing so.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
4,"Fun, if a little dark","I first read the companion, Girl's Night Out, and thought I'd read this one because I enjoyed the other. I was not very familiar with the genre, but did enjoy both books. I found this one a bit darker than the sequel, but that actually was a nice change. It really changed my vision of what chick lit was (for the better). I also like the shorter stories. Sometimes I just don't have a lot of time to invest in reading and enjoy the feeling of completion."
1,This is not a Karaoke CD,"The CD should be background music with no voices, but it includes a voice - it has a singer in every song. Although the description says it's a karaoke CD that's not what it is. I wanted to use it to do a sing-along at a hospital, but I can't because it includes the voices. I'm VERY disappointed."
3,"DIFFICULT to read, awfully unstructured but meaty enough...","If you're new to Consumer Behaviour, DON'T read this. Read a general (a typical textbook will do) text book to gain familiarity with CB concepts. Otherwise, you may feel a wave of nausea coming over you.It's a book which is not easy to read at all because the structure of the books is rather weak. However, the contents are meaty in that East does not take any theory as THE theory (and neither should we as CB practitioner-academics or academic-practitioners) - therefore he explores and explores (unfortunately a better structure is needed to convey his ideas). He does prove that theories should not be taken for granted and we should constantly test them. Very difficult to read, but has some good points within it if you can read through it."
2,Cheap plastic ...don't buy it.,"We purchased the unit 2 or 3 years ago and while the autofeed is a nice feature, the downfall is that it is built so cheaply, that the plastic hardware that houses the spool has already fallen off, apparently because the plastic-metal junction on the shaft melted the plastic. We have a small yard and are not using the unit commercially. As of this morning...It is no longer functional, and I am going to think twice about purchasing another black and decker weed whip."
2,Grass Hog not so good,"Bought it 2yrs ago. Works well, but the tended to use too much line in opposition to what it claims. This third year it pooped out. The rotor dropped down causing it to slow considerably. Being an electrical engineeer, I tore it down and discovered the casing holding the field windings and bearings had failed. The inexpensive plastic casing failed to hold the rotor bearing against gravity and allowed the whole rotor to drop downward."
4,Excellent Product,"We have had the Black & Decker corder grass hog for about a year. It was very convenient and I loved the fact that I didn't have to ""bump"" to get more line. Bumping never seemed to work with my old string trimmer.I feel like our yard is about average in size and we went through about 4 spools in an 8 month mowing season. This seems reasonable to me.However, at the start of the second year the motor quit working. It had a 2 year warranty but because I didn't have any of the warranty information or receipt I felt like they wouldn't honor it (I never tried though).Despite the problem with the motor I plan on buying this same model again."
4,"very engaging, relationship centered, emotional...","to me, this book was very much about different kinds of relationships. Sarah and Jack, the main characters, have a distant relationship - they do not wish to be too deeply involved in each others lives, and that is what makes their relationship last. Then there are olga and otto becker, the old couple who are still deeply deeply in love at the end of thier lives. how often does that happen? its beautiful. There are also the relationships of sarahs sister, mother and father, and more... i guess i would have like to have the book go a bit more deeply into the characters' motivations and rationale, etc. but anyway, a lovely book."
1,save yoir money,"I bought it because few HO scale trains have steam... the steam on this set only happens when it runs full speed for a while and full sdpeed is not very fast. The hookups between cars suck...always come apart, and it does NOT stay on the track well. Guess there is a reason that steam HO trains are $300 just for the engine.Stay away from this set , it sucks. I'll stick with my O scale NY Flyer set that is durable and works well.this toy is a train wreck!!"
3,Train Set,I got this set for my Husband - because he had never seen a train set that had smoke coming from the engine - He LOVES it!
3,A Decent Watch,"I've had the watch now for three months and couldn't be happier. For the price it is doubtful that one could do better. There are, of course, better watches out there. This one appealed because of its reasonable price. It arrived on time in a splendid little box. I had to have the band sized but beyond that the thing is perfect. It fits well, looks good, without being pretentious. It is not too heavy; it is rather light in fact. The next step up clearly is into the fine Swiss watches, but this one has all the necessary components. I happen to like the red sweep hand and the larger hour and minute hands, but that is a matter of taste. Wenger is not a well-known name to me, but I have read some good reviews in high brow watch journals and believe this was a great buy."
4,Great Product,"I purchased this after using a similar piece that was corded for a while and wanted the freedom of not being on a leash and forgetting I had it on and getting pulled back to my phone. This bluetooth set is great. I had my doubts, but I'm very impressed. The setup was very easy and even though my small ears prefent me from using the earpiece without the headband attachment, it's quite comfortable and just what I was looking for. I only heard a complaint from the sound quality once, but I didn't have it charged all the way."
4,Good speakerphone,Speaker phone quality is very good. The mute button activates silently which is something I appreciate because my last phone did not and people could hear me coming on/off mute.I wish that the headphone jack and button would work with a wireless headphone. I got this product and also purchased the Plantronics CS-55 wireless headset. The only way to connect the headset to the phone is by disconnecting the handset. I agree with other reviewers who commented that it would be good if you could lower the volume of the key tones when dialing. When using the phone at night when the kids are asleep it is noisy.
3,poor spellcheck,The book was great...but you must watch for spell check. It will drive you crazy until you realize that Borgrael and Gorgrael are the same person. This is just an example but you get the drift.
1,Boring!,"What ARE all these reviewers talking about? This book is DULL. It is very cliche and full of all the standard fantasy tropes, with bad writing and childish names, as well as particularly cardboard characters to boot. As a transplanted Aussie, I cannot take any pride in the efforts of this particular countryman. Try Juliet Marillier if you are looking for someone from Oz who can actually WRITE."
3,Worth your time.,"This series wavers on the edge of excellence, but just doesn't quite get there. It starts much like a Goodking/Jordan sort of tale and sometimes includes the darkness of Martin's Fire and Ice.Maybe this will be resolved in future books in the series, and I suspect that it is, but characters like Axis are showing some blatant and annoying character flaws, that cause reactions that even the village idiot would avoid. Minor things like neglecting to inform your betrothed that you're having children by another woman.Maybe the rest of the series will explain or absolve some of this. We'll see."
2,Pulp Fantasy. just not worth the money,"I had heard of 'pulp' science fiction but it was not a term I could readily apply to fantasy--until now.The Wayfarer Redemption is not Bad Fantasy [as upposed to Pulp], though parts of it flirt with crossing the border between the two. It is not so awful that you demand your money back, though you think about it. It's just pulpy--the same old fantasy tropes, flat characters, childish dialog. There is nothing here to fire the imagination, to touch the heart. It is just campy.I don't spit at the Wayfarer Redemption completely. It is a fine companion when the doctor's office is running late or in an airport during a long layover. But it is definitely not worth the hardcover price, and you might even want to buy the paperback used."
4,Fun!,"I grew up playing Kings Corner with a regular deck of cards. I taught my eight year old granddaughter how to play last month and thought she would get a kick out of a set-up that was made just for this game. She's loves it, but would rather have me there to play against."
5,An All-Time Favorite!,"This adventure with Toot and Puddle is one of my all-time favorites. It is an adorable story about two friends, one who loves to travel the world and the other who loves just staying at home in Woodcock Pocket, USA. The postcards that Toot sends Puddle from his world travels are cute and humorous! The illustrations in this book are incredible. This is a book that adults and children alike will enjoy together. I never get tired of reading this one over and over. It is a book my children will keep and pass on to their children!!"
3,"Some ferrets like this, others don't","I bought this at a clearance sale for 75% off a few years ago; a pet store was discontinuing its ferret products. My first three ferrets wanted nothing to do with it, so I put it away with everything else that they never used. Now those ferrets have passed and I have a pair of one-year olds that have ""inherited"" the old stuff. They love this thing, and chase each other through it constantly. It's hard to know what pets will play with and what will just bore them."
2,Not bad...,"This text was supplied to my class of BLS Paramedics. I have to say that the concepts were easy to understand and all BUT... For the most part Paramedic students are adults and this book uses alot of ""explain it to me like I five years old terms"" I keep it on my shelf at home and thats where it will stay."
3,A Review of The Act of Thinking,"Melser's book is an update of the behaviorist model of mind in general and Watson's theory(Behaviorism, John Watson, Transaction Publishers, 1998, pg 214) in particular. The modern studyof cognitive systems is so clearly an interdisciplinary subject that it is simply perverse whensomeone attempts it in such a one dimensional way. Today we can actually insert signals into brains.We can measure neural responses. You need not stand outside the head. You can open it up,go inside and poke around!"
3,Wore out prematurely,"I bought the Broan 690 upgrade fan to replace the cheap fan that was oringinally installed by the builder when my home was built. There was nothing wrong with the builder grade fan...I just wanted a quiter fan that would move more humid air out of the bathroom. It was only used whenever the shower was in use, which was maybe an average of 20-30 minutes per day. It's been less than 2 years, and it just started making an awful grinding noise. While it worked, it worked well, but the cheap builder grade fan lasted a LOT longer."
4,Love this show!,"I really do love this show, but the copy of it I received was in 4 different cases & looked like perhaps it had been from a movie rental place that allowed people to rent each disc separately. I keep my TV on DVD series on display, so it looks a little tacky on my shelves that way, but the discs all play great, & I really enjoyed watching them!"
1,Derivative,"I found Cooking With Lazers to get old fast. The riffs are repetitive, and don't seem to expand beyond a couple of chord changes throughtout each song, and all the songs are performed in the same key. The musicianship seems rather weak, as most of the recording seems to rely on computer generated samples that have been ripped from someone elses song book. It sounds like a wannabe Beck or Beastie Boys, and just comes off like a copy cat recording. No real innovation here, just immitation. In a nutshell, derivative."
5,Right On!,"I have heard these guys play live in Chicago several times and always have a great time. I must admit that I was a little fearful that, like many good bands, the studio recording would not capture the energy and excitement that they generate on stage. After hearing Cooking With Lasers, I can't believe I ever doubted the Brothers - it is simply an amazing record! It is apparent that they went to great lengths to create a unique, original recording that goes above and beyond what they are able to accomplish live. Thank you!"
1,Terrible service,I am still waiting 3 weeks later for a book to be shipped! I emailed them with no response!!! I don't understand why they can't email me back at least!!
4,Give it a break !,"Despite some errors, this is STILL the only REAL instrumental methods book on the market - if you want to see REALLY BAD books, look at the competitors! In terms of presenting instrumental theory, describing in detail the instruments and their operation, and providing detailed drawings of the instruments and components, this book has no peer. That's why it is used for more Instrumental Methods courses than all other books combined, and why I continue to choose it for my students."
2,Desperately disappointing,"War Game is a desperately disappointing animated adaptation of Michael Foreman's excellent children's picture book about the Christmas Truce of 1914. Unfortunately, in the hands of the Snowman team it's all just too nice and safe for the respite to have any power, and the loss of the haunting ending from the book (where the hero's body slowly vanishes under falling snow) in favour of something less upsetting to the kiddies renders it all even more so what: only the beautiful yet quietly devastating closing lines of narration truly work. Terrible performances from many of the voice cast, too. At least at 29 minutes it's brief."
3,Nice,"Im starting to get into DnB.So far everythin is good, and Im really starting to like it, especially Dieselboy's work. The sixth session is great, another album you should get. Well with this, I would say its good. It doesn't have the full blown out bass and isn't dark. To me it sounds sort of like chillout music/dnb. Better description is, like you ever hear Acid House(where they play it in the chillout room in like raves)its sort of like that/the dnb.I would recommend this right away to people wanting to get into a new genre under EDM(Electronic Dance Music)or if you want to get into DnB. Overall, not his best work, but good."
1,First and last book...,by this author. I can't anything too new compared to the other reviewers. It was just too unrealistic and I don't like the hero drooling all over the heroine from page one.
2,Cliches and soft porn,"I stuck with this book because the characters were okay and the plot kept on moving, but readers should be warned that there's a bit of soft porn -- explicit sexual activity -- in several places in this novel, and some of the cliches get worn out with overuse -- and other cliches get abused. For example, if you can read, on p. 251 of the paperback, ""She didn't know what it was about his smell that literally turned her inside out..."" without picturing what effect that would have on the heroine, you might enjoy this novel."
4,Fantasy Lover,This was an interesting read. You feel so sorry for the poor man who is trapped and only used over the centuries for sex. Most men's fantasies. But I could relate as no one every saw him as a real person with feelings. He is surprised when the heroine doesn't demand sex from. It has a nice ending. I will re-read.
4,very entertaining,"I love paranormal series. this first book makes me want to read the others. this author is funny, witty and the sex scenes are seductive and fun. i would recommend this book to my book club."
1,"disappointed, basically soft porn that fizzled out...","I bought this based on previous reviews. The beginning was interesting and the book is well written, however the ongoing ""sexual desire"" became boring and I finally put it down. Either have sex or not, and continue with the story line which was of interest..."
3,So so,"I was psyched from get go about this book. I would love to live within the pages of certain books, or, have a hot hero step out and tear off my bodice, I thought this book would hit me in my happy place..... Alas, it wasn't to be. So much potential, just to have it ripped away and replaced with fluff. I prefer my characters edgier, harder.......hotter."
1,What a waste of trees.,"Put simply, this book was a waste of my time and money. Mythology is great, you can take it to great places. She took it to the trash can. I like romance, but this was just tooooo sappy, cheesy and stupid for me. Some have told me to read the next ""its better, she gets better"" but Im afraid I wont re-visit her books anytime soon."
3,"Neat story idea, but...","This is one steamy little book with some real great steam. Oh, it also has a story about some greek guy in a curse. The greek curse story would've been a real cool one to read about, but it was obviously not as high a priority in the plot as the steamy hot love scenes. Too bad."
1,LAME!,"If I could have given this book zero stars I would have. Everything about this is just awful! The writing is mediocre at best. The characters are underdeveloped and not worth caring for. I like ""adult content"" in my books as much as the next person, but this is HORRIBLE. There is ZERO STORY, just sex, and not even good sex! Please, do not waste your time or money on this lame trash."
2,new book with NO ACCESS CODE,"I ordered this book because it was cheaper then on other sites. I bought it new for the purpose of not having to buy an additional access code for my online class. Since when bought new the access code to WebCT should come in the new book. I received the book with no CD. So after all that, I still had to pay an additional fee for a code when it should have came with the book. A very big hassle. I called customer service and all they said they could do was send me another book if I returned the book I had purchased to them. That would be an 8 week turn around, and by that time I would have been half way through my class. So instead I had to purchases the code on my own. I will not buy books from Amazon again. There are other text book web sites that understand the demands of buying books for schools."
2,No split-track,"This is partly my fault, but I like the karaoke CD's with the option to sing with or without the music. The ""Billboard"" brand is the only one that I have found with this capability."
5,loved it!,I bought these for my new car and they look perfect. They arrived earlier than said. Happy with this purchase
4,The ultimate how-to,"Tom Hetzel, who has crossed the English Channel eight times, more than any other American, has created clear, concise directions on how to accomplish this daunting task. Hetzel supplies all the information necessary. The reader has but to have the will to follow the steps Hetzel outlines (and considerable skill as a swimmer)to follow in his wake. A down to earth, practical how-to for one of nature's greatest challenges."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I was very excited to get the Margarator as my friend has one and loves it. Unfortunately I used it only 3 times and it broke. The gear that turns the blade is made of plastic and has already been shaved down. Also a couple of the screws fell out and needed to be replaced. I have fixed it but it will probably only last for only a couple of more uses. VERY DISAPPOINTED!UPDATE (Jan. 10,2008) I tried to use the Margarator over the holidays and it was completely broken, it wouldn't even start. I have never been more disappointed in a product."
4,Fine,"A good toy for the price, also fast shipped.Armor is shaded and looks fine, not super detailed but just ok. Skin is a little bit to pink at some points. paint on his clothing is not always perfact and you sometimes see small spots of the under colour. Sword was the worst part very undetailed the blade does not even shine... Luckily I have metal coloured painting. shield is to much bent.Is not ver balanced and easily falls over.Not perfect but I'm happy with it for the price."
5,must have,"the truck i previously owned had these mats and i really liked them so i purchased a set for my new truck and am just as pleased. they fit perfectly and do everyhting they claim. Living in alaska we have snow for at least 7 months of the year and it gets tracked into the vehicle, melts and then over time the carpet begins to smell. these mats catch everything and keep it away from the carpets. i have to take them out and empty them once in a while, but that is a small inconvienience for what they are capable of.thanks for such a great product!!!"
2,Long time user - not satisfied,"I have had this camera for over two years. While the images are accpetable, I am have a terrible time capturing software. If your main goal is video editing, then this camera will be a nightmare.Pros: Small, relatively easy to operate.CONS: expensive camera, expensive tapes, still images are not of good quality when considering a comparable still camera, proprietary format may go way of betamax. No microphone jack, makinig it hard to hear people in crowded area. While using pinnacle, when editing, I have to spend more time syncing the sound, rather than being creative with the editing process. (Granted, this may be a pinnacle software issue, but it highlights the lack of compability with the .mmv format).If I knew then what I know now, I would not buy this camera."
4,Stickers.............are so much fun!,"These are tiny chart stickers.....about the size of a fingernail???? SMALL! Perfect for charts, behavior charts, job charts, etc. What else can you say?? They are stickers....they stick...that is pretty much what I was looking for. LOL"
4,Great Author of Thriller,"First time reading T. Jefferson Parker and now I am hooked. Great story line. Very ""real"" characters. Loved this book."
3,Yoga Nidra is wonderful,"If you're going to listen to yoga nidra with headphones, you'll probably really enjoy it. I play this from speakers, and I have trouble understanding the words. The music selection and guidance is wonderful when you can get the words."
3,Scandinavian Yogi???,"I ordered this CD based on all the glowing reviews it received. Maybe I missed the part about this guy being Scandinavian. (I'm sorry, I already listed and sold the CD, so I can't tell you from which country Swami Saraswati originates). I found his accent so off-putting that I could not really get into the relaxation. I also found the cows ""mooing"" in the background a kind of bizarre reference when trying to induce a state of deep relaxation. Actually, I don't think I realized what Yoga Nidra was. Even when reading the enclosed booklet, I was more taken with the implied promise of positive creation than in obtaining near sleep.If one is not bothered by Scandinavian accents and pastoral backgound noises, I'm sure this would work for relaxation. However it is NOT meditation, at least not in any sense of which I'm aware."
1,...,"This vacuum was such a disappointment and waste of money. The cord is not long enough. The suction is awful. It barely picks up anything. The dirt cup must be emptied at least once each time I vacuum, and the messy filter cleaned off. It has a burning smell every time I use it. I HATE it!! Usually I'm pretty easy to please, but this vacuum is the pits!!!! Even though this vacuum is only 2 months old, I am researching and looking into buying a new vacuum. What a complete waste of money!! ..."
1,Don't buy this.,Worked for a short while. Now it leaves lines of dust and won't pick up anything. I also can't find a replacement filter. I'm very disappointed in Hoover.
5,Great game for stroke victim rehab!,"I bought this and several other games for a family member who suffered a stroke. Their right side was deeply affected. I found that this game was fun and highly effective occupational therapy. The whole family, 6 - 74 years old, played this in the hospital room. I can't say enough good things about this simple game. It should be noted that this game wont work on a smooth surface. I keep a wash cloth in the box and play the game on it. Also, this game is too difficult for children under three."
1,Really awful plastic smell - but only the travel size!!!,"You know, I LOVE Get Fresh products, particularly the starfruit pear fragrance. But you will seriously regret buying the travel size hand creme. As soon as you open the flip-top, it reeks of plastic, as if it has absorbed the smell of its container. None of the other Get Fresh products smell this way. If you dare to use the product, then your hands also reek of plastic - all day. Even washing doesn't take it away. Skip this one and get the larger size bottle, which smells wonderful and is worth every penny."
1,Terrible!,"I downloaded this video from my TiVo so I didn't have the benefit of Michael Cerda's review, but he hit all the right points, so I won't repeat them here. Just that this video is terrible. I would rate it negative ten stars if I could.My primary impression was that it was a poorly produced video to show in class. However, this video is so bad it will suck out any interest a student might have in science. None of the content is memorable. I just wanted the video to end.This video is not of publishable quality and should be pulled from Amazon."
5,ACCURATE FORTUNE TELLING ! OMG ~ WOW !,"I'M SHOCKED , AMAZED .... AWESOME ... ON POINT ! THE BEST ! .... I've been using this product for over 15yrs , from the 1st time I was first introduced to it back in the early 1990's ! ....""NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ELSE LIKE IT"" !, I WISH THEY WOULD MAKE AN IPHONE APP FOR THIS BOOK AND I WISH IT WOULD BE ON THE KINDLE APP AS WELL. May the person that wrote this book , memory be blessed forever more , God bless her soul Ms. Margarete Ward ! , Put on some Meditative music , yogi, Hindu, etc ... your set ..... Check out this link as well ![...]"
4,Great for my Pony Lover!,"My Six year old just got this for Christmas and really loves it! It is a pretty sturdy house, as far as these type of playhouses go, and wasn't even that hard to open. It is a bit hard to open in the closed position, and she sometimes needs a little help with the catch. There are a lot of TEENY pieces, so if you have other small children I would not recommend this, but overall, I think it's a good buy for you money. You will need to purchase some more small ponies, though, because it only comes with one..."
1,DO NOT BUY,THIS IS A HORRIBLE FOOD AND SEEMS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY ANIMAL DEATHS. GOOGLE NUTRO NATURAL CHOICE BAD FOOD. THERE ARE MANY HORRIBLE STORIES WITH THIS DO FOOD BEING THE COMMON FACTOR
1,High Maintenance-Not Worth the Money,"I bought this vacuum to replace my old Fantom Cyclone because of the commercials making this vacuum seem like the best vacuum in the world. It was a bad choice. This vacuum is very heavy and hard to pull/push. The height adjustment only has 3 settings so the next one higher to make the vacuum easier to move leaves the vacuum to high and with bad performance. The dirt canister is not user-friendly to clean. You have to get your hands in the canister to loosen up the dirt that tends to get stuck on the pre-filter and hepa filter. This vacuum is extremely noisy when in use. The vacuum also looses suction very quickly when hair or lint builds up on the pre-filter. Overall, this is a badly designed vacuum that is way to over-priced for the performance and the high level of maintenace that is required. I decided to return it and get the Bissell Lift-Off that is highly recommended and totally out-performed the V2 and cost me $100 less."
1,Hoover Windtunnel V2 poor performer,"Purchased five months ago, 08/25/2002. Have a dog with medium length hair and a wife that sews occasionally. Hair and thread wrap around the cheap and poorly engineered plastic bushings designed to protect agitator bearings from wearing and debris. Bushings have dissolved away in four months and agitators no longer spin. You would be wise and buy a better designed brand or be prepared to disassemble and clean bushing and bearings frequently...A useless vacuum to me and only for dust pick-up."
1,windtunnel V2,"I was very disappointed with this vacuum. The suction is great and it really fluffs the carpet. However, in less than three months, one of the brushes cracked and the pedal broke. The turbine powered hand tool uses suction from the vacuum and when you try to use it on upolstery, the brushes turn off. It would be a great vacuum if it didn't fall apart under normal wear and tear."
1,disappointing JUNK!!,"Incredibly frustrating! My family has owned Hoovers for decades, and I bought this with that formerly stellar reputation in mind. I've had this for 7 months, and, being a bachelor, have used it only 4 times(I don't clean much huh?) today it sucked up a penny and rattled for not much more than 6-8 seconds before I shut it off. It now will NOT agitate whatsoever, the motor spins and grinds the gears relentlessly, even after I tore it apart, lubed the gears and outer bearings with Dry-Slide, and rest the breaker. I can spin the agitators by hand, but this 12 AMP motor can't!. What a piece of s**t!!!!!"
1,Pet owners beware,"I can't tell you how much I loved this vacuum the first time I used it. We have two dogs and this sucked all the hair out of the carpet. However the second time we used it I noticed a burning hair smell. I looked at the rollers and there was hair wrapped all around them. I took the hair off. The next time we used it, I noticed the same smell but also a burning plastic smell. I took the rollers off and noticed that the plastic had melted around the metal retainer that holds the rollers. I was severely disappointed after spending so much money. The final straw was when the rollers quit turning all together. I took it apart and found that the gearbox that spins the rollers and the gears inside had actually got so hot that they fused together. What a piece of junk. DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING IT'S JUNK,I HAVE HAD THIS UNIT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND USED IT 3 TIMES. THE BRUSHES HAVE QUIT WORKING AND THE SOAP DISPENSER FELL OFF. I CAN FIND ONE PLACE TO SERVICE THE SHAMPOOER THAT IS OVER AN HOURS DRIVE AWAY. 3 PLACES IN MY AREA REFUSE TO WORK ON ANY HOOVER SHAMPOOER ANYMORE. THEY HAVE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE BRING THE HOOVER IN FOR SERVICE THEY ARE TURNING THEM AWAY. THEY SAID HOOVER USED TO BE THE TOP OF THE LINE BUT NOT ANYMORE. TWO OF THE SERVICE AND SALE CENTERS HAVE STOPPED SELLING HOOVERS ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE POOR QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP. I HAVE USED HOOVER PRODUCTS FOR OVER 30 YEARS BUT THEY WILL NO LONGER GET ANY OF MY BUSINESS.
2,Not worth the money,"2 words:a) Great pictures (as we may expect from Franois verlinden) b) Few explanations (no tips, no suggestions, no ""how to"")At the end of the day I was dissapointed. I prefer to buy some of those Japanese Magazines, I learn the same, pictures are better!"
3,Advertisement,"While the pictures are nice, this book really doesn't show you how to model military vehicles. It's mostly just an ad for Verlinden Productions items. However, if you do want to have pictures of nicely done models, then this book is for you."
4,combat ballets,"I purchased they about 3 months ago along with the Madden Bee's Ballet flat. They are holding up much better than the Madden flats. These are pretty comfy and I have replaced my old pumas with them. My only complaint is that there is very little arch support, but I remedied that by buying a pair of Dr. Scholl's arches."
1,Avoid if possible,"This was required for my Spanish class; it came with CDs. I have found this book difficult to use, as no keys exist for any of the exercises. Each chapter directs the student to a web site for resources; the link redirects to [...] and appears to have the sole purpose of selling more books. [...] [...]Update: despite the repeated references to online resources at the beginning of each chapter, none exist. Thus, there are no keys to the exercises, no help with pronunciation, etc."
1,Doesn't deliver as much as it promises,"Although the concept and title are not new (my decorating magazines have touted ""more splash than cash"" stories for years), the book looked intriguing,so I got it. It's OK. Yes, there are some ideas here, but there is great potential for creating clutter, too. I looked for some tips along the way to help me understand how to put it all together but I didn't find anything like that. I need more basics! Without that, what you have in this book is a smattering of OK ideas that may or may not add up to a well-designed room in the end. So, pick and choose projects from this book carefully, and then look for another decorating book that explains the basics so you can actually put a whole room together."
5,Awesome,"I Love it so much, I am willing to pay for the episodes. Great story line and characters. I love Daryl, can't wait to see how his story goes."
4,Great,"I really like this show, it is a little on the gory side. But I can't seem to get enough of it."
5,Great Show!,I love to watch this show and would recommend it! The show has plenty of drama and turns throughout the season.
5,Worth it,It's great to watch the show just a day after it airs. Amazon has great quality and allows for those of us who don't have cable (or if you missed it) to watch the episode for 2 bucks.
5,Great Show,"Great pace, character cast. I love that no one is safe here, no superheroes that save the day time after time. This show shows (yes, I meant to do it) that even zombie genre can be fun when done right."
5,Brains Brains and more Brains,This it the BEST TV SHOW by far. People who haven't seen this yourtotally missing out on one of the greatest shows. Stop watching reality shows and start watching a mind blowing zombie series.
4,Much Improved,"Far better than Season 2.I hate paying for each episode, but I'd rather pay Amazon $1.99 each than give any more money to Dish Network to include AMC in my channel line-up."
1,What the hell?,"What happened to the great screenplay of previous seasons? Characters were extreme but very convincing, the outcome of certain situations left you astonished but it was still coherent and believable. This season added awful characters/actors and the milestones are poorly directed. Some scenes like the raid on the military outpost are outright dumb. SMALL SPOILER AHEAD: Here's a group of tough military trained men who seem to keep their protein intake during a zombie outbreak judging by their physique, BUT are stupid enough to be PWNED by an small armed militia...... I was really disappointed."
4,Excellent tv show to watch online,"This is a very good show to watch online through Amazon. The price was reasonable & the picture quality was good. But since this show is often shot in dark settings, it is sometimes a little hard to see clearly. I should have tried it in HD even though it's more expensive, I probably will next time."
5,WALKING DEAD SEASON 3 MOST EXCELLENT,"i AM ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW ,LOVE THIS SHOW,IT IS MOST EXCELLENT, READY TO MOVE ONTO SEASON 4.MORE MORE MORE"
5,Worth it!,It will keep you in suspense. It will keep drawing you back wanting more. It was awesome. This season is highly recommended.
5,I love this show!,"This show keeps you intrigued. It is not like anything I have ever seen. It is a much watch drama. The zombie stuff isn't my thing, but the complexity of the relationships and the quest for survival keeps you hooked."
3,Story is 5 Stars but Amazons app does not Cach video so we had to watch in SD,"Amazon needs to have the application Cache a few minute of the video to the hard drive so those of us with slower internet connection can view in HD. Because there is no Caching we had to watch in SD, even though we paid for HD. With DirecTV they cache the video to the DVRs Hard Drive so HD remains"
3,walking dead,"Its OK interesting plot, well about as interesting as any other zombie flick nothing about this show screams must watch."
5,AWESOME,CLEARLY THE WAKING DEAD IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST SHOW ON TV SINCE 24. AMC HAS MADE ME A FAN IF ITS CHANNEL & I'M LOVING EVERY MOMENT OF IT. WAY TO GO AMC FOR KEEPING THE COMIC BOOK HIT ALIVE & WELL ON TV. YOU GUYS ROCK.
5,Loved it,"The production value is so high that its like very episode is miniature movie, it's great! I only wish there were more episodes to watch!"
5,"If I could, I would make everyone I know watch this series","But it's a little grusome and not everyone can handle blood and guts like me! A fantastic show, though!!! So addicting!!!"
5,Can't wait for the next episode,"I too think that season 3 is the strongest one so far. The surprises just keep coming. The only things I've seen so far that seem kind of weak: (spoiler)When Rick answered the phone at the end of Say the Word, I cracked up and laughed out loud with delight! What an awesome ending! Then, in the next episode, when you find out that it was just a nervous-breakdown hallucination on Rick's part - lame.Also, can Andrea really be that stupid?!?!But every series is going to have a few weak spots here and there. Still the best series I've seen in a long time!"
4,loved it. Will keep me watching.,i just became a fan this season but now have seen all three seasons. I will definitely come back for more.
4,I really like this show...,"but refuse to pay for cable because I only have a few shows that I like. I would give it five stars, except the characters keep doing things that I think are stupid and then end up fighting for their lives...LOL. Yeah, I'm hooked."
5,Walking Dead,I love this show and can't hardly wait for new episodes! I don't know what I'm going to do when this season goes off.
5,Amazing,I Love this show! It is a must see for everyone. It is very well written and always leaves youwanting more
4,Love this show,"Would have been five stars if not for buffering problems. This could have been due to my rural location. Worth the nuisance in order to ""catch up""."
3,boring,This show is just starting to get boring. Its too bad as I really liked it at first. Oh well.
4,Set Up Episode,"This episode sets the scene for Woodbury and the Governor. It is more scene and exposition and less action. Pay attention to the details. As a fan of the graphic novels, I am very curious to see how this storyline plays out."
5,Great Show!,This is the perfect zombie show. I've been a fan from the start. I'm glad I can purchase the entire season on Amazon video streaming!
4,INTENSE!!!!,"The show is building to a busting point...... I think one word will best describe the Walking Dead.....intense, Intense, INTENSE!!!"
5,Great show!,"Wonderful show, can't wait for this week show, very good and would love to see this show go on for a few more years."
4,Good,I wish it was not so expensive although cheaper than iTunes. Fun watching the season in my own time at home.
5,I love it. I can't wait for each new episode,I give it my top rating because I enjoy knowing it is waiting for me whenever I want. The show itself gets my full attention i am taken away by it. i hope they can keep it going as well as it has been going.
5,Keeps me coming back,"So far so good, only they have managed to kill off nearly all the first seasons cast. Women are in short supply too. Interested in seeing where they go from here."
5,Millions of fans can't be wrong!,"The Walking Dead is beyond a success. Millions of fans tune in each week to see what is happening with their favorite character. The show draws you in to a point that you feel you have a connection with the characters and that you sometimes feel as anxious as the characters are. The show is about the survivors, THEY are the walking dead, not the walkers (zombies). The show is so much more than blood, guts and gore.....it actually has a story, and it is a good one. The story is well thought out and made very well for television. Some may disagree because all they want is zombies, but if that is the way the show was made it would have been cancelled after it's 2nd season. Season 3 has been non-stop and full of action and drama...enough to keep the viewers happy and wanting more. No one is safe on the show, even the main characters are being killed off...but no one knows who or when, and that is part of the draw that keeps us coming back for more!"
4,Damn good show,"A show should be more than theatrics. There should be a story that pulls me in and character I can love and love to hate. Walking Dead does just that and it does it well. I take away one star because some of the acting is a little lacking from some of the more major characters, both protagonists and antagonists, but it's not a show killer. I eagerly await future episodes. Gimme gimme."
4,Brutal,"This year has started off as much more brutal than the first two seasons. Very good show, but be prepared to hide your face often!"
4,Cannot wait for season 4,The best zombie apocalypse film series by far! Lots of drama and stars are not spared tragedy from death or harm.
3,Gore is gore,"While it is interesting to see the detail behind the special effects, there are only so many ways you can show gore-splattered zombies before its gets boring."
3,"Good episode, poor streaming","Definitely love the Walking Dead series. Amazon still has some catching up to do in the streaming business though. It paused a couple of times and we have some quality cable internet speeds at the house. Netflix is still the leader, but I admire Amazon's efforts."
5,Totally awesome,"I like it as much, if not more than Dexter, which I never thought possible. Two enthusiastic thumbs up! The characters are dimensional and there is just the right amount of conflict and angst."
5,Fantastic Season!,It's a great bounce back from season 2 that lagged a bit. I'm so happy that they are back to making it tense and upsetting again!
3,Getting Cheesy,"Andrea a leader? Kinda has a John Wayne swagger so why not? That may be the first chink in the armor of this super show. This and the whole show needs a little more plot development, or they could switch to an animated format. Developments aren't convincing me that the zombies, or what they represent, are a real threat, more of an irritating situation, like bad weather. Once all zombies are laid to rest, the real threat to civilzation must be what it always has been, the lack of skills needed to build it. None of this is depicted, for example, what about basic agrarian interests? Industrial needs? In this season the show is focusing on the survival interests of two deranged men. All the while the storehouse of manufactured supplies is dwindling. If this show is about the thinking vs unthinking, it could go much further."
5,was very good,was very good a liffhanger as usual always leaving you wanting to comeback for more and not wanting it to end
5,the best show,"I couldn't wait for this show to return. Watch an episode, but remember to breathe !! One of the best shows on right now."
5,Walking dead is shuffling its way into my viewing schedule.,"SeasOn 3 of WD is easily, thus far, my favorite. Unexpected twists, turns and deaths keep pulling up in this post-apocalyptic thriller. I gave this 5 stars, but in reality it is so much mOre. If like me you are relatively new to the WD franchise using Amazon to catch up on season 3 is effortless and wonderful."
5,One of the best series ever!,"Watch it, you'll love it. And start from season one episode one and watch sequentially. A story about surviving a ZA apocalypse and surviving what's left of humanity."
3,Kinda boring but hoping the next episode makes up for it,This episode was kinda boring and wicked at the same time. The ending was so gruesome and setting up the new character to be so mysterious. Hopefully this episode is setting up an awesome next episode!
2,Dumber and dumber we go ...,"Is it just me is this show turning into a B movie? The characters seem to be getting dumber by the week and the show is inconsistent from week to week.Seriously, one week Tyrese is all about respecting Rick's territory and then the next, he and his group are eager to join in and slaughter the people in the prison? Andrea shows up at the prison in order to make peace and then by the end of the episode she's steeling herself to kill the governor. Rick hallucinates one episode but they're gone the next ... sheesh, what's going on? This is turning into the same story we've seen time and time again, except what usually takes and hour and a half to end is being drawn out over a season.Just a weak season and really disappointing, considering the mountain of prison stories BEFORE the Governor they could have pulled from the comics alone."
5,It Just Gets Better,The best show on TV in years. Every episode has a twist and a turn the viewer never sees coming.
5,Amazing,"Love being able to watch where ever I am at, ESP since I'm never home when it airs. Totally convenient"
5,Awesome,This season is awesome. Me & the wifey are hooked. Too bad we have to wait till February for the continuation of season 3... Amazon can you work on the HD quality. I'm on a 20 meg connection so it's not that.
5,Great Series,"One of my favorite show on TV! Seasons 1 and 2 are great, 3 lags in the middle but still worth watching."
5,I love this show,"Best season yet! I think most television is stupid, and will not pay for cable, however this show is worth $1.99 a week. This is story telling at it's finest. I have not watched a dramatic television series this entertaining since the Soprano's. The cast and crew are getting better at what they are doing, also."
1,Never thought!,"I never thought that I would ever watch something called The walking Dead, but got addicted immediately. Season 3 was just as good as 1 and 2 and I cannot wait for season 4. The back stories are really good and I have become enamored with Norman Reedus (Daryl). His brother is a monster one loves to hate. Happy that Rick's wife died as she was becoming tiresome, as was Shane. Glen is another hero of mine and I hope he lives to the very end. Want to see the governor get his in a nasty way. I also adore Michonne and want her to get revenge on everyone.Keep the episodes coming"
3,Episode Three is Not What I Expect from The Walking Dead,"The first two episodes of season Three were excellent in every way! This episode -- episode Three -- was not what I want to see from The Walking Dead. The group wasn't shown at all in this entire episode, and they are the ones I enjoy watching. The show is going in a different direction in this episdoe and I really don't care for it. I usually give every episode FIVE stars, but this one I can only give THREE. I do not enjoy when these types of shows/movies end up in a place where weapons are taken and people are treated as slaves."
2,Soap opera with Zombies,"I really don't get all the hype. This show moves at a snails pace and is pretty predictable. It's basically a soap opera with zombies that they drag out as long as possible. Every episode I can't figure out why I keep watching it. I wouldn't continue to give it my time but my girlfriend is always bugging me about it. She likes it because ""it's filmed in Atlanta""."
1,AMAZON - GET IT TOGETHER,"Every Monday after a new episode, it's the same old thing. ""cannot connect"" Can't leave feedback. Can't download. It might be easier to just pay for the cable and watch it on AMC, and get rid of Prime, and quit PAYING for episodes that cannot be streamed or downloaded on MONDAY."
5,ADDICTIVE,"The Walking Dead is very addictive, and the characters are awesome! Every week n episode end then I can't wait till see the next one."
5,Be show on TV!,Walking Dead is the best show TV has ever had to offer! It really makes you think about what would happen in the real world if something like this ever happens. I have watched each episode at least 2 times!
3,Walking dead season 3,It is not bad it could be much better very disappointing when i thought we all were finally done with Lori they screwed us
5,Seed,"It was OK, not the greatest, taking to long to get to the story line. The first two seasons are the best so far."
4,Excellent... Except....,"This show is excellent in the realm of zombie ideals, with real life tough decisions. However, it could do without the female relationship drama. But, I guess they cant't make it for just men's entertainment. Oh well."
5,Action,Enjoy the intensity and action would recommend to everyone. I can't stop watching and wanting more it a must see show
5,Amazing!,"Definitely the best shows on television right now! They know how to do zombies right, which has never been done before!"
5,Oh My God,that 's pretty much what I say after every episode of walking dead. it is that good. it is SO good. I love zombies. I want to kill them all.
5,Walking Dead Season #3,"Great series keeps getting better! Cant stop watching it,keep coming back for more. Cannot get enough. Waiting to see next episode."
5,amazing,My husband and I love this show. We have 2 children so when it is time to watch this show it is our time. It is amazing love it. What more can I say.
4,Walking Dead bites back,"Walking Dead 3 has been most enjoyable, the zombies make up and effects are excellent and the story line is quite captivating - The Chemistry of the Actors works well and it's always exciting to see what's going to happen next -"
1,Rip off!,"I have been watching Walking Dead weekly and this week I searched for ""Walking Dead Season 3 Episode 3"". I clicked on the first thing that came up and accidentally purchased this. I was so annoyed with the ""1 click buy"", but figured I might as well watch it anyway since I had just paid for it. This behind the scenes ""Zombie Studio"" was like 3 minutes long. For $3. OMG I can't believe how much of a rip off this was and I didn't even want it to begin with!!!!!! I am so mad."
1,Online only,I was really upset that this is a online only viewing. I'm a trucking with a very limited monthly bandwidth allowance from my hot spot. So I can't watch this unless I find a high bandwidth location and willing to use my password in that location.
2,This one can be skipped.,"I've enjoyed the episodes this season. Very interesting, intense, exciting. This one in my opinion was mostly filler. If you read a synopsis of this episode you will pretty much own the essence of it. Seeing the actual film won't do much for you. This episode would have been better released as a comic book, a couple pages. It shows you the few tiny elements that happen. Then says ""tune in next time when something actually happens...""The one thing of interest was the ""fat"" zombie. Congratulations, you've created a grosser zombie than the fat well zombie, I think. UGh. Disgustipating. I actually fast forwarded that part. yuck!hahaha~!"
4,Better,"After the stella season 1 season 2 kind of floundered for a story. Episode after episode of characters aimlessly wandering around, accomplishing nothing - seems a little silly for a zombie plot that could literally go anywhere. They seem to have figured this out in season 3, and have drastically improved the episode plots. There is WAY more action, and a lot more activity. And they've even managed to successfully incorporate some very interesting new characters - finally! I haven't finished the season yet, but it just keeps getting better and will hopefully finish strong."
5,Great Season,"This season keeps up the great story lines from the past seasons with the addition of a few more. This ""TV"" show is SO much better than most zombie flicks on DVD and even some that make it to the big screen."
4,"Better, faster and more focused than Season 2","Season 3, so far, has been what Season 2 wanted to be. Quick. Fleet. Vicious. It coordinates reflections on humanity, tragedy, primal urgings and zombies to fit within 45 minutes. And it does it well."
5,Love It!,"I love this show, but it's not too different in plot than any other soap opera. ""A stranger comes to town"" or ""Somebody leaves"" are common to almost all stories."
5,Love it!,Its an addicting season! Cant get enough. Amazon makes it easier to watch because it streams right to our computer so we can play catch up and not have to wait until season 3 comes out on dvd!
5,Walking Dead,"Most Walking Deadheads are watching and enjoying, my girlfriend gave it to me for Christmas!! A great gift for anyone anytime!"
4,Entertaining,"Very entertaining if not the best writing. I'm not even into zombies, but I like the relationships among the characters."
4,Finally a book I can relate to.,"I loved this book. For many years I have looked through every book about Vietnam I could find just to be disappointed that there was no documentation about my ""Blind Bat"" work. This could have been a story about me. My assignment to Naha AFB, Okinawa and later transfer to the 'Blind Bat' operation in Ubon, and eventual reassignment to Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. This is the book I would have written."
3,Is that all?,"Plot: marginally interesting. Characters: I kept wishing I could care about them. I was pretty disappointed in this book. After hearing people gush about Laura Caldwell I expected much more, but this seemed ""cranked out"" and devoid of much feeling."
4,Be Careful What You Wish For...,"Kyra seems to have the life any girl would want: her career as a fashion designer is beginning to take off and her husband, whom she adores, becomes a movie star after the unexpected success of his latest movie. Love, money, fame - what else could a girl want, right? Well, it turns out that the pressures of celebrity threaten a lot more than Kyra's marriage. The author does a good job giving us compelling characters who are doing their best in privileged-yet-trying circumstances. This novel is a fast and fun read."
1,"Maybe a lemon, you tell me","I have had my F7425-900 for a year+ and have had the rotor replaced because it rusted, the spin brushes replaced because the plastic pin snapped, the detachable handle on the dispenser detached when it wasn't supposed to, now I need a new dispenser since it hit the basement floor and cracked. Now that I have fixed most of those items the water spray will not stop spraying! I have not been rough with this machine. I am thoroughly dissapointed with the craftsmanship of this machine. So much so, that I am afraid to buy another Hoover."
2,Only good for a little while,"I bought this steamvac back in Dec, 2004. It worked wonderfully at first, but started to fall apart after the 3rd use. I just pulled it out of the closet last weekend, and the scrub brushes wouldn't spin. After a little Google searching, I discovered that indicates some internal parts have rusted, and it's cheaper to just throw it out than to fix it. So, my steamvac is now in the trash can.The only reason I'm giving this product two stars instead of one is because I guess I did come out ahead cost-wise versus paying to have my carpets professionally cleaned a few times a year. But I still think this product should have lasted more than two years considering what I paid for it."
1,"No stars, if possible!","This P.O.S. is a great example of why America is ""going down the tubes"" economically. Total junk, got three uses, spewed water on the second use, now clean water reservoir has broken, no replacement parts available. Can't hammer Chinese made stuff when American labelled merchandise has this total lack of quality!"
2,It probably won't last much longer,"I bought this model in December of 2002 and it immediately had a problem with a broken valve that required service at a local authorized service center that was covered by the warranty. It worked well after that but now, after the warranty has run out, another valve has broken on the clean water tank and I am having trouble finding a replacement...although it looks like when I do find the part it will cost about $50. It seems that the valves that control the input and output of water from the tanks are just made too cheaply out of weak plastic and they are going to continue to fail."
4,Good quality steam vac,"I have this item for quite a while, while it preforms well, it is not the equal of a professional machine. For general use it is quite good, but if a professional look is needed, use a professional machine."
1,Worst steam vac we have owned,"We have a large house and two young boys. I'd estimate we are using our steam vac about 4-8 hours a month. This is our third steam vac. In the last two years, it has been to the shop twice before loosing power to the brushes tonight. When it was working, its performance was good and it was easy to use. One downside though is the water tank falls off easily and the hand tools leak (at least ours do). I would not recommend this model."
3,Didn't last as long as I thought it should,This cleaner only lasted 2 years. Within the first year the top bucket started to leak and not at the seal. It started to leak where the clear part of the bucket connects to the base of the bucket. So I repaired it...it would still leak just not as bad. Now after two years it has about four leaks...let's just say it leaks just as fast as I can fill it. So I went and bought a new system...this time I bought a Bissel.
2,Hoover Steam Vac,"The steamer itself works okay, but the attachment for stairs, although it has brushes, has almost no suction. The hose is difficult to get a tight fit, so it may be defective."
1,confussed,"I baught a HooverVac V2, only to have to return the holding tank twice in one day. The plastic keeped spliting and water leaked out. I thought I was doing something wrong!!!! I tried everything. Finally after a very bad day, two tanks later, my carpet was clean. Now it's the holiday's, lets clean the rugs again..BAD BAD day again.The holdingtank split again. I packed up my cleaner up, went to sear's and got my money back!! It would be a great cleaner if they could fix this. If not, it's nothing but a big waste of time."
1,Wear Swim Shoes When You Use It,"Just like every other person has stated, this thing leaks like crazy. I used it apx 3 times when it started leaking all over the place. After reading the reviews about their customer service being so crappy, I am not even going to bother trying to have it repaired. I think the problem will just continue anyway. I will purchase a new steam cleaner and it will NOT be a Hoover or a Bissell."
1,What a MESS!!,It leaked water & dirt. All over the clean kitchen floor.I bought this unit before reading the amazon reviews.Because I read that others had problems with the unit leaking I fortunately had my towels ready just in case.It's going back. It did a so-so job of cleaning. I'm going to try something else.
1,Water Tank Cracks Easy,"I really loved this Hoover and it performed well, until the water tank cracked. Upon looking for a replacement I found info all over the net about similar problems. The replacement even comes with pad to absorb shock when putting the tank back in the cleaner. These go for 45 to 70 bucks shipped. Looks like Hoover cost reduced the quality of the tank. Anyway...stay away."
3,"Cleans Well, Leaks Even Better","I have had the cleaner for just over one year, purchasing it since a puppy is now part of the household.The machine is very easy to operate, cleans well, and is easy to take apart to clean.The BIG problem is that the clean water tank is tissue-paper sturdy. It cracks at the drop of a hat. I used my warranty and replaced the tank TWICE. (Good service, by the way). Last week I lent the cleaner to my best friend, who cracked tank number three. I will replace the tank myself since the warranty has expired. This is the last time I will replace a tank.Should tank number FOUR crack and start to leak, my next replacement will be something other than Hoover."
1,Third LEAKING machine,"This is my THIRD (and last) steamVac. Three strikes and your out! When the machine works.... it works very well... which is usually the first few uses and which is why I have tried 3 times now to get one that does not leak. It cleans great and it is very easy to use. But then it starts to leak from the clean water tank. Just a trickle at first. But by the 4th time you use the machine, water is gushing out of the bottom of the clean water tank!! I just want one that does not leak... but if I can't do that with three machines then the chances of you getting one that leaks I'd guess is pretty high. I am now going to try another model. I hear the Hoover Agility has better reviews and is even cheaper! Best wishes in gettting one that does not leak, and if you do... consider yourself lucky!"
1,Don't buy Hoover,"It's does not vac at all. I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica, they worked great. Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well. My only good vac was the upright that's cordless. It does not clean very well, but does the everyday job of picking up dirt. My ex-wife got it and still using it. I need to get one. Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too. Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy. 3 strikes, your out Hoover. I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
3,Keep fighting with Hoover!!!,"When this product works, it is great!!! But when the tank breaks which it does all the time, fight with Hoover! They got so sick of me that they sent me a new machine at no cost. I have gotten over 20 tanks so far (I clean the carpet alot) and have long since passed the warranty deadline. I have yet to pay for one. If they say that the warranty is over, I create a stink on the telephone and they end up sending me a new tank at no cost. I get it in 3 days. Keep fighting for those tanks!!! Like I said, when it works, this machine is great."
2,Great when it's working properly,"I bought my SteamVac in May 2005. Like another reviewer, by the time I'd finished my carpets the first time, the brushes had stopped rotating. I took it in to the Hoover repair shop and had it fixed (under warranty). I got it back in June 2005. Since then, I've shampooed a few times - I have dogs, so I shampoo a few times a year. I've been happy with it's performance overall. This weekend, a year and 10 days after purchase, I took it out and found the brushes not rotating - again! But now I'm 10 days out of warranty. I've noticed I'm also seeing the leaking now that others have warned about. I'm disappointed because I've had a Hoover before that was a work horse and lasted quite a few years. This one, for the price, is a big let down in the reliability department."
2,Crappy model in a great line of cleaners,"Pros: excellent suction, sufficient weight so you don't have to press it against the floor with your foot.Cons:- Leaks like crazy. You need to mop the floor of your kitchen or bathroom after every refill. God forbid to do a refill on a carpet!- It requires several attempts to correctly install the ""clean water tank"", and the thing keeps leaking on you in the process."
3,Hoover Steam Vac is HEAVY!,"It is extremely heavy. I cleaned two fairly small swaths of carpeting, by the entry way and in front of the sofa and my hand was sore for 4 days. The hose attachment is cumbersome; it doesn't stay on and just adds to the weight of the machine. I took mine off. The brush is hard to take off to clean; there is nothing to grasp to pull it off. The lint cleaner on the bottom of the machine...could they have made it any harder to pull out? My dog threw up. The mess was cleaned as much as possible by hand first, using Nature's Miracle, allowed to dry, then I cleaned it using Hoover Pet formula, going over the area at least six times and then rinsing. It still smells like throw up. I'm not impressed."
2,"Cleans good, hand tool sucks, breaks easily","The cleaner cleans well on the floor, but the entire internal turbine rusted out in 12 months and had to be replaced, the clear water tank cracked after 2 years, and the hand tool barely worked well to start with. Buy something else."
1,Dissapointing quality,"I too own one of these SteamVacs and after reading the reviews I am beginning to regret ever buying this product. We've used the SteamVac a number of times and have really good things to say about it's ability to clean. However, since the clean water tank on our unit just broke I too have to rate this as a 1 star like some many others have done here.When you consider the price to replace the tank, around $45 and the machine cost of around $280, how many tanks do you buy before you start searching for a replacement unit? Would I consider another Hoover? Hum, this is a tough question. NOT!If they, Hoover, could prove that their other products didn't suffer from the same deficiencies then maybe I would consider them again. But at this point with no evidence to suggest otherwise I would not buy another. In fact, I would go further and suggest that if you are considering the SteamVac Dual V, don't buy it. Unless you don't mind buying a new tank every year!"
1,Broke after 3 uses.,This very expensive machine broke after only 3 uses - The brushes no longer work and trying to get service is a nightmare-I would not recommend this machine .
1,NOT RECOMENDED!!,"I purchased this unit last April 2005. After 2 months it quit working and the overload light came on. I unplugged my computer and monitor, (only things plugged into it), and it still wouldn't work and light said ""overloaded"". I called APC and had to send it back for $25.00 shipping. Their policy is to send a ""refurbished"" unit. Took a month to get. Second unit did the same thing. Sent back again, received another in about a month. Now this one just went out also. Same problem and booklet says it is an internal error, when it does this. Not a ""fault"" in my wiring or ""reverse polarity, or anything else on my part. My last unit a ""Contaxt"" lasted over 8 years. Basically in my humble opinion, this a piece of junk. As is their return policy, where you pay the shipping and only receive a refurbished unit. States so in their ""warranty"". Of course you can't read it till you get it home or to the office. Not very reputable. Used to be a good company with good products. Not any longer!"
1,APC overload,"Apc is not made in America. Mine was made in Bangalore India. I should have paid heed to the other bad review. My unit acted just like he said. I purchased my XS1500 in July 2006. The first of Sept. the unit went to overload. All I had was an 210 watt load (monitor and harddrive). I unplugged everything and it still went to overload.I plugged my monitor and harddrive into the wall and they are fine. Don't try to deal with APC online because there isn't any response and you'll get into an endless loop, just go ahead`and call right away. My brand new unit is going to be replaced by a refurbished unit and I will have to pay for shipping. You only get free shipping if it fails within 30 days. Don't buy this unit."
1,Great job for a short time before breaking.,"My family bought one, my sister also bought one. Both machines worked very well the first few times they were used, then our motor quit. It was repaired under warranty and worked a time or two more before the brushes stopped spinning and the whole thing started leaking. Same thing with my sisters machine. $600+ wasted on two cheap pieces of junk. We also had a Windtunnel V2 vacuum by Hoover that worked great until the plastic roller brushes literally melted after several months of use. Another $300 down the drain. I don't know what has happened to Hoover, but it's not the same company it has been for many years. Avoid Hoover products for the sake of your sanity and your wallet. We've replaced the V2 with a Kenmore Progressive bagless vac, $300 regular price - $250 sale price, that outcleans a friends $700 Dyson. Recommend the Kenmore (Sears) model 36932."
1,Clean water tank too brittle,Twice the clean water tank has broken. The plastic is very thin and brittle. It was very expensive to replace the first time. I won't replace the tank again. Time for a new brand of cleaner.
1,looses suction,"My model F5872-900 Hoover SteamVac is constantly loosing suction and I have to stop, reseat the recovery tank. I am so disgusted with this problem. Otherwise, it cleans well."
1,waste of money,"trash, this is the worst product I have ever bought. The water tank has started leaking after only 2 hours of use. made of really thin plastic that will not stand up to normal use. a recall needs to be enacted on this product. I have an older deluxe hoover model that was made in the USA that has lasted for years and expected the same quality from this product. On a positive note it worked well before it started leaking. &quot;buyer beware of this junk&quot;"
3,nice reference on RM,"My goal in ordering this book was to gain a better understanding of the career and personal life and controversy surrounding Robert Morris. The book served its function and was written in a readable style with efficient organization.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
1,incorrectly advertised,"Advertised as 21 inch, to be used with ""all small 2 inch balls"". This is not the case. 21 inch is only for larger balls. Chuckit used to sell 21 for all sizes, but apparently no longer does. Advert needs to be updated."
5,"strange, disturbed, frightening and facinating","This movie works only if you let your imagination sulk to the very Id of one's being. This is not commonplace material and is only for a limited audience. One needs to understand that madness is more norm than exception, and the beautiful almost lost art of self destruction is just below the surface of many of us."
5,Complete your collection,I bought the Prey Collector's Edition which came with the Tommy and Hunter figurines. So I bought this to complete my collection. Why not? I was only $1.99 with free shipping. No reason not to buy if you have the others!
2,Only 2 good songs,"Not the bestcompilation cd....personally I got it only for ""Spirit In The Sky"" by Norman Greenbaum and ""Dancing In The Moonlight"" by King Harvest. Other than that, the songs left me flat. There were plenty of other 70's classics they could have picked to round out this cd, but I wonder why they settled on the other fairly uninteresting sings. My advice, if there is a particular song you are loonking for, then get this cd, otherwise, look for your song of choice o another compilation album."
4,"good story, good mystery, good stars","i've watched for this one for a long time. it's not very well-known but should be. it's got a good mystery that you are trying to figure out as you watch it. it's a bit light-hearted for a film-noire, which i really enjoyed. good performances by everyone. the cover art is laughable, as the main character never looked like that. and the title is a bit over the top for the story. but i hope it will have a much greater audience now that it is out on dvd. the comments by robert osborne always add a lot."
1,Wrong DVD!,"I bought this DVD because I liked the Pink Panther series, and I already had the first volume of it. When I got the DVD in the mail, inside the DVD case was the first volume DVD! Somebody mixed up the first volume DVD inside the second volume case! I'm really upset right now; I didn't get anything new."
4,Fun for kids,My kids and neighbor friends just love to watch these for hours on end. Great for the portable DVD player on long road trips also. The orchestra music (although very repetitive) and lack of annoying voices adds to its appeal. Pink Panther cartoons are creative and enjoyable to watch with kids of all ages. Cartoons made today don't rise anywhere close to this level of quality.
4,Great product!!!!,I really really like this safe. Its authentic and even has some ajax in the top of the can. My only issue is that the bottom of my can the screw top doesn't match up all the way. When I screw it on there's just a little bit of the bottom that overlaps the canister but other than that I love it!
2,Opening too small,"It looks authentic, however, the opening is so small one cannot fit a credit card in there. That was what I wanted to hide along with some papers. I tried to adapt it and there is no way to keep it closed."
5,Ajax Safe,My 15 yr old son would never touch an Ajax product so I use it for my money or something I dont want to worry about him getting. He will get any money I leave out if its just a 20 or less so I can put it in this and not worry if I dont want him to get it.
5,"""Best place to hide stuff is in plain sight""","It's got a decent amount of room. It's not obvious at all what it actually is unless you pick it up and shake it a bit. Put a little real AJAX on top of it for that genuine used look and no one will ever know. Just hide it with the cleaning stuff in your kitchen or bathroom, and your good to go."
1,unbelievable stereotypes & reviews,"Watched the first half hour on TCM tonight (about all I could take), couldn't believe all the stereotyping going on. Would rate this 0 stars if the system permitted. Pretty insulting stuff...and all the laudatory reviews for this movie are even more amazing."
1,Not Original Artists,"This CD does not have the original artists performing the songs, which is all that really needs to be said about this CD. I normally would have listened to cuts from the CD, but I don't have a sound card at work and made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it. Still, you shouldn't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if a CD with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it."
4,Overview of National Socialism,The videos are a good overview of National Socialism. The videos help to put the decade of 1933 to 1943 in context.
1,Rocky Mountain Berry Book,"Did not have enough information and the variety was lacking. too many berries were left out??? not a good book......heavy on a recepies, mostly a waste of time."
5,Great,this is one of the very few cams that is compatible with my MAC PC. great picture quality and color. great investment.
4,Good cam,"This thing is fine. Does what it does. I don't expect a ton of utility with actual in-game interactivity (superimposing your face on a character's face) -- I imagine most users will use it to interface with other users over xboxLive. USB means it can also work on a PC. Some suggestions:1) Everything else is wireless on the 360 (controller, networking, racing wheel) so why not have an optional wireless battery-operated cam?2) I'd like to see it priced a tad downward ($29.99).3) How about a grip attachment that many of the Logitech (and some others) employ (the thing is so tiny and weightless that it might fall off of whatever it's standing on).These are very minor gripes."
1,Xbox 360 webcam,"Im really dissatisfied with my Webcam i was expecting to get one that worked. but it doesnt work properly and its really frusterating because it only stays on for about 20 seconds then it turns off for 5+ minutes then turns back on for 20 seconds and repeat. i bought this so i could keep in touch with my best friend because we moved across state from them, but obviosly thats not possible with thiis webcam."
3,A nice little camera.,"It is a nice little camera, but there really isn't much of a reason for this on Xbox, there are a few games that support the camera, but to be honest don't get it unless you have other friends that have it because the few games that do use it only use it to put your face in the game or video feed which gets old quick, but if your friends have one then you can video chat with them which can be fun depending on who your chatting with. The camera can also be used on your computer, but just remember the camera has no flash, auto zoom or focus and picture quality is okay at best, but for that price what do you expect."
4,cool,"this is a good product, maybe just a tad expensive but cool productl and i like this product and recommend"
5,Online Shopper,I purchase the vision camera for my son so he can have a better playing experience. I rate 5 stars because my son is pleased and if my son is happy than I'm happy. I would recommend this product.
5,Great Gift,"This was a gift for one of my grandarlings, so cannot rate this item, but he was thrilled to receive it."
4,Good buy,The camera provides a decent picture and nice adjustment to lighting conditions. Works well with my iBook in iChat which is a plus for me.
4,Don't you wish?,"Yes, I like these books. Perhaps they are just fantasy but we can always hope for such progress! And, yes, I would deem it progress."
2,Not durable enough to use,Very fragile. Even with gentle play they are falling apart and my son was just given this about a week ago. It sucks that he loves them because it breaks his heart every time another one rips.
3,"Interesting, provoking.....","Read this in one day. I found it to be a compelling read, essay, if you will, on the subject of a child star who grows into adult superstar. It's a perspective on a fascinating, complex individual. You are going to get some history on Michael Jackson; things that are pretty well known. The writing is sparse and she does a good job of not interjecting her opinion-too much. This book gives you something to think about, makes you consider how we, the public, treat our celebrities."
2,Bland and boring.,I just didn't find this interesting. Sorry but it didn't hold my attention at all.
4,Exploring my ancestry,"""A Taste of the Past"" is just that for me. I was over 30 when I learned that my mom's dad was Jewish, not merely Hungarian. After my mom's death, I began to study about Jewish family life. My mom and her dad had visited their family in Hungary in 1907, 1915 and 1922, but my mom spoke little of that. I visited his birthplace (near Kosice, Slovakia - formerly Hungary) in 1996. I joined on-line Jewish genealogical websites. I found two aging Jewish relatives in Cleveland. ""A Taste of the Past"" has opened for me rich insight into Jewish family life in Hungary in the late 19th century and 20th century. I am no cook, so the food recipes are beyond me - except that my imagination allows me to savor them! The author is a man of great generosity of spirit, that imbues every page of ""A Taste of the Past""! Am I ever in his debt!"
4,Highly thought provoking!,"Baptised a Catholic,but not exactly brought up in the faith,I found Anno Domini to be a very thought provoking look at the days of the Early Church.I thought it's descriptions were fantastic-but I wonder how real any of it REALLY is.I have been trying to search for information to back up the authenticity of the information this book is based on so if anyone knows anything at all to do with what this book is based on or the author,please e-mail me!"
1,Pet Owners-FORGET IT.,"This is far and away the absolute WORST vacuum I've ever owned. Having four dogs, I always look to Hoover because the hair doesn't get wrapped around the beater bar wheels. But this one is a different story. Even when the beater bar is dog-hair free, it creates the worst smell for barely picking up anything at all off the floor. Thhe attachments won't stay attached to the vacuum either, so that's another annoyance factor. After battling this piece of crap for six months now, I've told my husband to take it to the dumpster. I thought about the Salvation Army, but it's too close to Christmas to saddle a poor unsuspecting soul with such a huge hunk of junk."
5,KING KONG A MUST,I have been waiting to get a good copy of the MIGHTY JOE YOUNG But it's been imposable Until Now This Movie has been forgotten over time When I have mentioned it to any one they Don't know what im talking about And What a Bonas toget the Sonof Kong I have Never seen this Movie Before And top marks To the Person who did thePresentation Box Set It's Worthy of these great Classics And top marks to the company for the Remastering It's Perfect on my Big Projection Screen Good On Ya
5,Great price for a great product!,How can you go wrong buying all 3 great ape classics in one set? Anyone buying this set pretty much knows or has seen the movies but is looking for a nice nostalgia trip. This is it! The special features are great. Alot of info on how everything was animated and good shots of the actual models as well. This set also includes a great documentary of Merian C. Cooper and his visions. Highly recommended for a fan of the classics.
2,It made a mess and was not what I wanted,I will never order thing cartridge here again. It made a mess and was not what I wanted. I am very unhappy.
2,Not worth it.,"I guess this book might help a little if you don't have a yellow pages handy and/or are totally clueless. It's basically a listing of preschools in San Francisco who have submitted completed questionnnaires to the author. Buyers of this book should be aware that not every preschool is represented, and those that are have chosen what information to include (and what information NOT to include!). It's certainly not a substitute for interviewing friends, neighbors and other moms at the park for recommendations."
4,Useful text for average amatuer,"I have been very pleased with my copy of Construction. I am an advanced amatuer, trying to build furniture making skills by taking on some projects that are fairly complicated. I find myself returning to this text time and again to understand my construction options and the proper steps in executing the project. The book is well illustrated, comprehensive and organized. Notably, it is not just a bound set of Tauton reprints, but instead a real reference manual. I think that books like this should have a DVD that illustrates the content. There is nothing like watching an experienced person demo a skill to build your own abilities. With a DVD I'd have given this 6! stars. But still, this is worth having."
3,Didn't Work,"I was looking for a holder for my Droid phone, did not work. Also the clips that hold the unit to the AC vents was hard to use."
3,To small,It is too small for my blackberry. It also did not come with any clips to put it in the vents.
1,Disappointed,"This product didnt fit any of my devices and I checked the dimensions before purchasing. It mentions that it is adjustable, but only meaning that the with of the vent clips is adjustable. And i did not realize that the vent clips clip around the vent slots, but do not hold them in place, so the holder will slide down to the bottom of the vent and rest there; which, if placed where i intended to put it at the time of purchase, would turn out covering things that i would need access to."
3,Quality gone from Gemany's trains.,"I always wanted a ""G"" series train. However, I was very disappointed With the Quality of this train and the required use of batteries to run the sound and passenger car lights. I had anticipated that a German company's product would be like their automobiles. But, since this train was made in China qualty went out the windows and plastic parts came in"
4,I'm satisfied with this phone,"I've had this phone for 6 months. I have had no problems with clarity. It would be nice to be able to adjust the volume a little higher. Its easy to use, mounts nicely on the wall and meets every need I have in a phone."
2,Great - until the buttons die,"I thought I had finally found the phone that solved all of my problems - it worked well, had great range, and was reliable. Now it's a year later and I'm fine as long as I don't want to dial anybody because the buttons no longer work. I can't recommend it for the long haul."
3,Inconsistent sound quality mars an otherwise bargain phone,"This phone is comfortable to hold and the base station is relatively compact. And the sound quality is OFTEN decent. However, there've been too many times in which there's weird static when I speak... and I think this may be due to the phone being sneakily 5.8 *AND* 2.4ghz (and I have a wireless network). Indeed, I find this to be really misleading advertising! Why is the phone trumpeted as 5.8ghz when it uses both the 5.8 and 2.8ghz bands? Given the number of people with wireless networks nowadays, I think this should be prominently mentioned on any spec list (and I didn't discover it until I looked in the manual -- too late for pre-purchase decisions!)"
2,CSFS3 the crash factory.,"This game is crash happy, and no patches from microsoftseem to work, with winVista or any directX.I pitched my copy of it...just could not get it to stopcrashing."
1,another horrible time sucking MS product,"I have a 1 GHz system with a new 64 Mg Radeon video card and 512 mg memory Win98SE.Once installed - 3rd try it wouldn't get past go. Locks up with the ol ""invalid page fault yada yada yada"" ... that Bill Crates MS has nothing to respond to.Avoid this time consuming anger genrator. I will always stear clear of MS products - this was a gift and now its in the garbage where itbelongs. Dear Bill Gates - please secure this cd where the sun won't damage it beyond what I have done to it pretending it was your face."
1,Unloadable,Many system conflicts. I had to uninstall it to make my computer function again. A HORRIBLE HORRIBE program. Anyone looking for a flight simulator should AVOID this product like the plague. Go instead to a dedicated site devoted to flight simulators.
1,Do not buy if you have a ATI Radeon graphics card,This game locks up my computer with the ATI RADEON 9700 PROcard. Both Microsoft and ATI have no fix for this as of 11/07/02Check out game reviews chat rooms before you buy.It did work slowly with my NVIDIA card
2,CFS3,"fun ARCADE game, if you have the horsepower to run it. It is not i repeat NOT a Flight Sim any more than Crimson Skies was a flight sim.MS really had a chance to raise the flight sim bar after the release of IL2 last year and they blew it big time.half the so-called features of this game dont even work. ie. playing gunner positions in the bomber. its totally useless as the gunsights dont even line up with where the bullets are going! about an inch off on my 17"" monitor.Multiplayer?? forget about it unless you are on broadband, its a total lagfest.If you want a serious and realistic flight combat sim with good netcode for multiplayer, go buy IL2.If you prefer arcade type flying games CFS3 is for you but i would wait until it hits the bargain bins."
1,Impossible,"This game is nearly impossible to load. My PC met all the minimum requirements +, and the game won't load without a new video card. Forget it!"
3,"Has Potential, But....","The Sim has lousy sound, poor control over external views? If these were fixed then I would no doubt play it more. Go with ""Forgotten Battles"" & all the add ons, its spectacular."
2,Disappointment,How Microsoft ever developed the neat original Combat Flight Simular and then went backwards is beyond me. This new simulator is a real disappointment.They do not even have a training section for landings... which everyone liked to use in the old package. Or it is too hard to find for if it is there I cannot find it.UGH....Mike L
