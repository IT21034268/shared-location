2,What's the fuss all about?,"This is more a biography and ""behind"" the scenes book about the PUAs. There is no such a thing as ""DANGEROUS MANUAL ON HOW TO SEDUCE WOMEN"". Read Robert Greens's one instead. It deserves two stars for revealing this information, only!This book only became famous and this amount of success due to a website where some people post about their secrets. And from what I've seen, this website is more famous than I had thought."
2,the game,"The book has some good data in it but Neil used the people who taught him how to play the game. At one min. he has Ross teaching him and then talks bad about him later on as he is learning from the others. I think he used ""I'm going to put you in the book"" to get his free teaching.Neil dogged Ross, but lets see others at Ross's age and bluild play the game with sucess. I'm not against any of the other instructors Neil discussed in the book, but Neil doesn't know what being loyal is."
4,The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists,A highly amusing book to master the art of picking up lovely ladies.
3,I gave up half way through,"The night I bought this book I had just come from a dinner with a social club that brings together folks who mostly don't have partners. I am course am interested in meeting women, so a fellow at the dinner recommended I buy ""The Game.""Well, I was fascinated by the book at the start. Yes, there is a lot of truth in what the author says; I can identify with it and with him. But the sleazy bunch of men he writes about really left me with an empty feeling in my gut. And the women? Excuse me -- the sexual vessels. Well, talk about objectification!Anyway, I can scarcely believe that people like this exist, although, living in Los Angeles, I am sure they do.Anyway, I got bored with it about halfway through,So if you HAVE to read it, borrow it from a friend or look in the Culver City Goodwill for mine, because that's where I am taking it on Monday."
1,Blech blech blech,"Francis Bacon noted that ""some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested."" And then there's this book. Spit it out, then rinse with Listerine, and maybe even wash your mouth out with soap for good measure. It's not worth the paper it's printed on. Rarely do I not finish a book, even more rarely is it because I simply couldn't read past my disgust. This book did it."
5,Algum Brasileiro comprou?,Se algum Brasileiro comprou esse livro e gostaria de vender pra mim entre em contato no meu email poligono no site do yahoo ok? Valeu galera!
4,Good book,"This book has helped me alot and im not even finished yet. The only thing i didnt like was that it didnt go into detail about routines, i wish it had a chapter all about set routines and how to execute them. All around a good book though"
4,confidence builder,"One of my buddies told me to read this book because it would help my ""game.""After reading this book, I went out and got 4 beautiful women's numbers on the same night (something I would never dream of doing before). The reason I gave it four stars is because you aren't really being truthful to the woman. You use rehearsed lines to pick get their number. But, they do work.It is pretty gross that women respond to the advice in The Game. Why can't we just be nice guys? Maybe this is where the saying ""nice guys finish last"" comes in.This book did give me confidence to walk up to a woman and be able to have a conversation from scratch. It is not scary I have just always psyched myself out.Good luck but don't take it too far. Some of the stuff in this book is a litte out there."
2,The Lame Game: How to pick up licentious whores,"women these days! theyre like machines! you push the right buttons and they start operating (stripping)! firstly you gotta understand you dont need much to pick up hoes... i mean girls, in LA. all you have to do is say ""i want a quickie!"" and you'll have em by the dozen on all fours like a pack of hypnotised dogs.you gotta understand... cassanova (neil strauss) himself failed to seduce the woman he really wanted, that is the woman he loved... she ended up stealing his heart.by the way... i'm not a cynical nerd. i'm not a mysognist either.read this book as you would a narrative... which i must say is interesting, vulgar and funny."
2,One for the geeks?,"Was a bit of a disappointment. Sure it had it's twists and turns but I was expecting something completly different.There is a geeky aspect towards this book that at times makes it hard to get my head around, so I did find it a bit hard to read. Mabey this is one for the Internet fans out there, not for your average joe.Thought the characters were well thought out, it just didn't sit with me well that this secret society turned out to be a bunch of geeks. Apart from that I enjoyed it, but wasn't blown away."
1,Revenge of the Nerds 4 - The Game,"Not my cup of tea, I guess you have to be inside the community to like this book. I would hate to see a movie made out of this.Mabey call it Revenge of the Nerds 4 - The Game.~JT"
4,"Not quite what I expected, but still good.","This book is, as its title might indicate, not instructions on how to pickup women.But never the less it provides a good insight in the type of society the Pick Up Artists work in, and it make me look at the world just a little bit differently.For tips on picking up women I recomment David DeAngelo's courses (available on DVD and downloadable PDFs) and all Mysterys material (only available as PDF)"
5,loved it,"bought this book a while ago, never had the oppurtunity to read it, but I recently moved and had some time to kill, so i read it, put it to use and pickes up a girl, it was quite interesting, I was skeptical at first, but it works fairly well, thanks neil"
1,book fell apart,The font on this version was so small I needed spectacles and the nearly every page of the book fell out after about 3 sessions of reading. It was shaping up to be a great read too..
3,Pretty Crass,"I was given this book to read on a vacation and after a few chapters just put it down bored by the crassness of it and the bad writing. If a woman can be impressed by a few magic tricks what does that say about her. What I did pick up was that men need confidence to succeed and not be afraid of failure. That is true in other walks of life too, such as negotiating a salary. Unless you are able to say no, you will never get what you want, even if it means that sometimes you lose."
5,What a journey!,All men should read this! Period! A great story of a chump that becomes a men among true men. This should be handed out in the 8th grade for all boys to read and review! Drop Mark Twain and replace it with this classic of modern times!
5,Great all around read. . .,"I was a little skeptical reading this at first because it seemed like an advice journal. However, once I dug in, I realized the author, Neil Strauss, had some real definition and posed solid points and tips on not just how to pick up woman, but how to pick up an entire room - girls and guys alike. It's a little slow in the middle, but the ending is what really sells the book. Things come together and once you realize that this book is about a way of life, and not just about getting in bed with girls, the message is revealed. Great read!"
1,is Neil Strauss for real??,"no, I don't think so. This book is, of course, BS. I doubt he ever slept with that many women. People love to brag, but what you say/write is not necessarily what happened. Helps him sell the book to socially awkward and retarded individuals who most beautiful women wouldn't give the time of day to, not because the guy didn't have the right technique, but because she's just not interested.Think about it: human beings have been meeting and falling in love since time began. You DO NOT need a book to tell you how to do it, go with the flow and let nature take its course. You also do not need a book to dupe you into thinking you can get anyone you want (unless of course you are extremely good looking and/or rich), because that's a lie. Only seriously sad people would want to read a book like this, or take any of his or his PUA artists friends' advice which is total BS."
3,Please get to the point !!!!,"Where's the beef?Strauss takes far too long to set the scene and deal the lines.I don't want to hear about ""mystery"" and other characters , I want to see them in action, hear the lines, see the shoot down and move on.Takes far too long to tell the story"
3,"Interesting read, horrible illustrations, both men and WOMEN are predictable","For perhaps the first time in my life I understand the psychology behind behavior I've always seen and not quite grasped. Body language totally eluded me for the longest time!This book reinforces the fact that most beautiful young women quickly realize they're a commodity and society engenders this behavior. For those whose desire it is to trigger a strong response(in the women selected), this book provides some insights as to how this is accomplished.Manipulative? Of course! But so is almost every transaction between two people on the planet, be it for sex or access to anything else one desires. We all weasel our way into getting things we want, regardless if we admit it or not. So, please, no more hypocrisy. To draw a comparison, this is the UFC(ultimate fighting championship) versus every other competitive martial art. The plain, no holds barred explanation."
1,Boring....,I found the author merely bragging about himself....nothing new.....no new technique....seems details made up.....boring.....1/4 thru the book I threw it away.
3,Nice,He tried to learn all about women and ended up knowing all about guys... :)I enjoyed the read... and the Bible look of the book was a neat idea... I placed it between my copy of the bible and the book of mormon... blends in perfectly... :)
5,AFC to PUA [Improved!],"So are you an AFC, Average Frustrating Chump, wanting to know how to be the best PUA, Pick Up Artist, in your town??? This book is for you - click buy now - you won't regret it. I have read the book twice and possibly a third time. It is worth every word, front-to-back. The game will undeniably improve you game with women, friends, business, and overall - your life.Neil Strauss writes about his account with the PUA community in LA's Project Hollywood and picking women up with Mystery in various clubs on Sunset Blvd. There was not woman in the clubs that did not hear the Best Friend Test, Cube Test, Jealous Girl Friend, and other routines.Pick up this book now and you'll learn the secrets of this secret society.Now, go Neg those girls!"
2,For the average man? HARDLY | Breakthrogh insights? NO,"The beggining of the book have some insights about approaching womem, but after that he starts telling a long story about his sexual adventures. But to the stuff he tells you gotta have PLENTY money - I mean not working monday to friday every week to pay the bills - and that is what the average and great part of humanity is doing right now. He doesn't really brag about it but you won't be able to afford his lifestyle.About what he teaches about women, nothing really new here, his tips they are all over the place, get a good book on sales and you find them all. I see no reason to recommend this book unless you already have a lot of money and want some good ideas on how to spend it.Cheers"
3,"Interesting, but not great writing","This is a truly intersting insight into an underworld filled mostly with dorks who learn a few tricks that turn them into magical pick-up artists. Some parts are creepy, other parts are impressive, many parts are monotonous. Hey, wow, Style got another girl's number! Amazing, Style has some more sex with an HB9.5! Look, Mystery's a depressed ego-maniac; and he's crying! It gets pretty old. But I was still pretty enthralled with the first hundred or so pages, after that it just gets tedious--except for Courtney Love; she's always hilarious."
5,The Game of Manipulation,"A simple book about manipulation of stupid people (men and women). Case closed. You either like learning how to manipulate stupid people or you think its disgusting. The book itself crawls into the deep cavity of darkness and lets you know that there are people in this world that are looking at different tactics of how to trick people. The Game goes into the lions den of that kind of person, and informs the world about how these people do the things they do."
5,awsome book,"This book is not only educational in the art of picking up women, but also a very entertaining and interesting story. I would highly recomend it to people wanting to boost their confidence and increase thier chances at meeting women. I would also recomend it to anyone interested in human behavour and how people (particularly women) respond in social situations."
2,should be titled the adventures of a sleezeball,"not a compelling storyline and not a page turner either. certainly not a five star book. save your money for something better, and for god sakes don't be like the characters in this book it degrades us all."
3,Good tips covered with creepyness,"Book has some great tips. Yes, it is a start for teaching men to attract women. But there is so much creepyness/sleazyness it makes everything look bad. Many guys want to learn how to attract women the honest way. This book turns those guys off because while showing what is possible, it makes the whole thing look like a freak show.-Ryanhttp://www.listenactattract.com/"
2,Not good quality,I bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. IT isn't of good quality and we can't see anything through it. We have tried all the lenses and the view is fuzzy and unfocused. Even in focusing it is fuzzy. I would not recommed this to anyone.
2,"Cheap, not worth the money.",Don't expect to get much functionality out of this cheap telescope. You definitely get what you pay for! Not very useful at all. The 5 yr old it was intended for has no interest in it whatsoever -- and he loves talking about anything astronomy. I'd pass on this cheaply made item.
3,good recorder with a few annoying flaws,"This unit is great for simple recording to DVD. However, you really cannot edit your title before you finalize it. That is, you can change the name of individual titles and their thumbnails, but you cannot edit the video itself (unless using a RAM disc). Also, you cannot pause or easily stop recording (unless RAM), which means it is very difficult -- virtually impossible -- to edit out commercials. Remote confusing, and mine did not work very well. Sometimes I needed to shake it to get it to work."
5,Panasonic Review,This replaces a Coby which had limited use and a bad habit of recording the alternate audio track which could not be disabled. This unit has all I would need until the HD units become more affordable.
4,Panasonic quality shows,"This unit makes very clear recordings.We use it in LP mode to record 2 separate subjects on one disk.Sold to me without the remote control, however any PanasonicRecorder remote works with it."
1,Not user friendly and lasts less than two years,"I bought this DVD recorder thinking I'd get a lot of use out of it and, hopefully, many years of use. I was wrong. I'm about to throw this into the garbage because, after a year and eight months, it shows a 'U99' error message on the machine. I called the service center and Joe talked me through some steps such as turning it off/on, unplugging it, pressing on this and that button for some period of time, only to be told that I would need to mail in this product to the service center to have it fixed for more amount of money than it cost me to buy. The warranty is only a year. I advise anyone against buying this product and brand. It worries me that Panasonic can make such a disposable product. I expected this to last about four years...definitely not less than two. This product is not worth the money."
1,warning...glictch do not buy,bought this unit from a wal mart...remote has no affect on unit...was cent a CD that was to repair the problem which the very unhelpful customer service reps sent me....now am waiting for shipping the unit back after sybil in customer service was to send me a new remote...that afterwaiting a week i finally called to find had been back ordered then the tech guy said the new remote would not solve the problem...had unit for almost a month when will i have a unit that works???? panasonic customer support is terrible..whats bad is the tech guy did tell me they knew they had these units on the shelf with a glitch in them...wish i had know i'd bought another brand for sure....i bought unit around april20th 2007....will update this when they finally have me a unit to replace this one that works....if you have problems with any panasonic product...please call panasonic and give these customer service people hell
3,"Norman Friedman, a favorite author.","I have read all of Norman Friedmans' ship design histories and own several, as well as works on other topics. I was curious to compare British and United States destroyer designs with respect to machinery, armament and fire control. I own the updated ""U.S. Destroyers"" so purchasing this item was a natural choice. I haven't finished it yet (such detail takes time to absorb) but I'm happy with the purchase.My only gripe is a wish for more detailed wartime performance analysis of each design.Other recommended books: ""Naval Firepower"", a study of big-gun fire control, ""Desert Victory"", the best technical analysis of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, ""Network Centric Warfare"", a history of naval communications."
1,New version is excellent,"I had problems with my original Iblast, but after contacting the manufacturer and receiving a new unit, all is well. The Iblast is excellent. Easy to use, holds my iPod firmly where I can see and control it, and allows no static or interference whatsoever. I highly recommend this product. (Unfortunately, since I'm editing my review, I cannot change the number of stars to FIVE)."
4,"Nice, compact set","We bought this set to use in our RV, where storage space is always at a premium. This is a decent, durable cookware set that stores in a small footprint. The only downside is that the pots aren't particularly large, but for our purposes they work perfectly."
1,Buy NO SNL Until Season Collections!!!,"If everyone would stop buying these loser collections by player or anniversary clips with no ""live"" feeling going from bit to bit, then MAYBE they will release these shows the way they are suppose to be viewed... uncut by season. Until they do this, no $$ from my pocket, AT ALL!"
1,Yawwwwwwwn,"Blah blah blah blah blah. That is what this DVD is. If I wanted to hear Lorne Michael's spiel again I would have listened to the other 10,000 ""We had it rough at first-- Nobody had faith in us"" interviews before it. I expected some of the best scenes from the first five years of SNL. What I got was a mish mash of people who like to hear themselves talk. And the scenes they did do, they didn't even finish. DON'T waste your money. The individual actor's DVDs, such as The Best of Will Ferrel and The Best of Dana Carvey etc..., are MUCH better. If they are planning on doing a series of these, such as 6-10, 11-15, etc... they need to rethink it."
2,Style but no comfort,These shoe look absolutely gorgeous. But you should only buy them if you have a high tolerance for pain and they also soil very easily. I wore them so I did not return them but I wish I could get my money back because I know I will never wear them again.
5,Dad's Favorite Christmas Gift,"My father loves Corvettes, but has no experience with computer games. He was so excited to experience the thrill of driving a range of different vettes again that he learned--and learned quickly--how to command the controls of this exciting racing game. For the Corvette lover who has everything except an actual Corvette, this is a chance to drive (and to dream) about a perfect ride. A good buy, Dad loves it."
1,disappointed,synching iPod with your desktop/notebook is ok. playing videos in your TV is a complete disappointment. do not recommend.
1,Waste of time,"This book is NOT about the Kingdom of God, it is about being a conciencous objector. I bought it with the expectation of learning something about the Kingdom of God but only found the author focused on one tennent of doctrine - thou shalt not kill. Even this tennent of doctrine, I dispute in the manner in which the author presents it. The commandment refers to not murdering someone. A soldier in the field of combat killing someone in the line of duty is not murdering him (imho)."
2,Well meaning but full of error,"Tolstoy became christianized to some degree before he died. But he clearly confused the Catholicism he was raised in and surrounded by with true Christianity. Which comes across loud and clear in his writings. Most of the world does (confuse the two). Other errors also compile to make Tolstoy's gospel a false gospel. Tolstoy does have some good things to say at times, but they are all interwoven with his own personal socialist beliefs and he seems to snatch bits and pieces of scripture references out of the Bible to back up those beliefs; rather than taking scripture in context with the whole he only gives acknowledgement to those verses which serve his purpose, his beliefs."
3,"No reason to call it ""for digital photographers""","This is your basic ""rules for good photography"" book. I was very surprised to see photgraphs in the chapter on portraits that were obviously taken in the 70's or 80's. Could those have been taken with digital technology?Any way, the book has a nice layout and 43, two-page layout chapters. Good for beginners."
3,Great Read -- Great History?,"Russell Martin has taken the history of the Spanish Civil War and a single work of art an woven them together into an entertaining and enlightening book. I am disturbed, however, by the author's Bibliographical Note, which begins ""This narrative is intended for general readers rather than scholars, and for that reason I have chosen not to cite sources in the text or in accompanying notes. But I will be pleased to answer queries directed to me through the publisher about specific sources...."" The author claims a great deal of detailed knowledge, from time to time stating with authority how Picasso felt in particular situations. It would be nice, even for a general reader, to know whether these conclusions were based on letters or interviews or the author's supposition..."
1,Didn't even last 6 months,"This camera was worthless. It cost me a lot of money, and the quality was horrible. It took a long time for the pictures load and it had a slow shutter speed. This camera didnt even last for 6 months. and even before that a lot of times it wouldn't turn on right away and I would have to turn it on and off several times before it would start up. It was a very poor quality camera, for a lot of money. I dont recemmend this camera to anyone."
5,I love Grohe,I have always been impressed with the Grohe products quality. I bought a whole set for my bathroom refurb. Will look great and work great based on past experience
4,Griddle worked great,"We used this griddle on our Coleman outdoor grill & worked great. Easy to clean, fit well - no sliding around on the grill & saved on us packing a separate fry pan."
5,Stove Griddle,This is a must have if you own a coleman stove & grill cooking set. The breakfast comes out great everytime and it's easy to clean. You can't go wrong with this product. It also fits in the carrying case with the coleman Stove/grill.
3,I enjoyed this book.,"I had been wanting this book for some time and when I checked with my local bookstore, they couldn't even order it for me. I suspect it is out of print. They recommended I check Amazon. Sure enough, Amazon offered the book and at a great price! My only concern is that the seller claimed the book was new with yellowed pages. However, it was not new, it had small marks throughout the book, obviously left there by a previous reader. But, at the price charged, I am not complaining. The delivery was timely and I really appreciated finding this book! Thanks."
3,OK product,"I got this because it seemed the cheapest (without being too cheap) portable alarm key chain around. The battery ran out really quick and the keychain part was very flimsy. It is nice and small though, and did provide me some peace of mind in the months after being mugged."
2,mose?,this series is disappointing. the anime was bad. the sound quality was ok. but this dvd series was not what it is descibed as.
4,"It's meant to be FUNNY, people!","The biggest draw of this series of books is their humor. Is some of the advice useful? Sure it is! Is some of it absolutely outlandish? OF COURSE! (My favorite example of outlandish advice is actually found in the Parenting handbook in the section on saving for your child's college fund.)I've read many books in this series, primarily for their humorous value. Yes, there seem to be a lot of self-help authors flooding the reviews with 5 stars and the cynical, humorless jerks trying to balance it out with one-star ratings, but let's be a little realistic people: these books are called ""Worst-Case Scenario"" for a reason; they aren't likely to be filled with everyday useful advice and how humorous people find them as compared to others is subjective. HOWEVER, it's another solid book in a very funny series."
5,Nifty bike rack,"This is a great bike rack if you have a hitch.. Slides over existing hitch so you can tow and carry the bike. largest part removes, so hitch only has small attachment on it when you are not using the bike rack.. Very useful item"
4,rushed,"I thought that the book was another excellent piece of work by Maggie Furey, although towards the last third of the book I got the impression that she was trying to cram another two books of information into 120 pages. I am eagerly awainting the next books in the series as she left a lot of things open at the end. But despite that it was a great book which I would highly recommend along with the rest of the series."
4,dhiammara,"I think, the story is good enough in detail and story lines that I really didn't believe that it would be the last in the series (even though the back cover clearly states In this fourth and final volume....). the conflict in the story in lady aurian when she lost her child and the lady who serectly return to the town knew where the child was . I like the book because it was touching. It taught me to listen to people who are in a higher ranking that you are."
3,Unsatisfying,"I know I'm not the only one who was just plain frustrated with the way this book was written. In the previous books, especially Sword of Flame, the story had a wonderful climax, characters, all that. Yet in Dhiamarra...it was lost. It got confusing twards the end, and whats worse, it didn't finish. What happened to that b**** Sara? What about Bern? Wasn't the Windeye, Chiamh, sort of getting unhealthy thoughts about Aurian at some points? Why did he do that? What did it accumulate to? And how are D'Varan and Maya going to deal with the Phaerie? This book left way too much to be decided. But what's worse, it didn't leave me with any feelings twards the characters like the first three did. The characters were just...names. What happened?!"
5,"A Brilliant Album, Lost No More","Thanks to this 2006 re-release, we've been given a chance to rediscover a classic album by the great underrated band, Comsat Angels. Many have described the music here as gloomy, but don't get the idea that this is the ""shoegazer"" sound of bands that came later. There is a power to many of the tracks, such as The Eye Dance, Dark Parade and Be Brave. It has been said the drums were moved next to the elevator shaft and recorded from several floors, creating a dynamic beat--such is the craft this band put into their music. The original album included 10 songs; this re-release has several bonus tracks, including Eye Of The Lens, one of the Comsats' greatest songs. Renascent has packaged the CD with a fine booklet including photos, album synoposis and quotes by Stephen Fellows, the Comsats' front man. With music this good, everyone should have this album in their collection (and on their iPod) now that it's lost no more."
3,A good summer read but not all that deep,"The book really had me hooked in the beginning. But the author lost me when he brought ""Mom"" back into the picture. He didn't seem to know what to do with her and the ending ended up weak and contrite."
3,A good and informative read,"Well researched and very readable story of USMC Machine Gnners. Having been an enlisted 0331 for seven years, I feel I feel a particular closeness to, and affinnity for, the characters in the stories. I Recommend this story for the Platoon Leader in training, and will, in fact, donate ten copies of this book to the Basic School Library."
5,Amazing,"A well constructed book,tells the stories of some courageous marines, during different conflicts,who because of their trainingfought valiantly with and for their fellow marines, Johnnie M. Clark writes great books about Marines and machine gunnerswhich are hard to put down, if the Vietnam war experiance or marines' experiances in other conflicts interests you, then I highly recommend you read Johnnies books."
5,Great Fit !!,"Received these jeans today, the fit is the best. It is hard to find a straight leg jean with a hidden elastic waist. LOVE them."
4,Innocence and joy,"They are naive, they are fresh, they are young and spanish.They sound different in a very good way.They inbue happines and hope in every soul that pursue a dream.Reminds me of simpler days."
5,"Thorough, well-researched","Fay's biography of Shostakovich is a welcome relief for the scholar and the general reader. It is carefully and (importantly) credibly researched and does a good job balancing musical and personal biography. It us utterly without histrionics or bombast, which is why it's a relief. The last twenty years or so have seen Shostakovich studies taken over by a political discourse that is more about its participants than Shostakovich. Claims that the book is dull probably reflect the fact that it's not written to be a manifesto or a potboiler. It's a clear, organized, scholarly narrative."
1,Flat Earthers and deep denial,"This is one of the small numbers of books on Shostakovitch which is almost completely unreliable. There is a type of intellectual (mercifully rare now that the Berlin Wall is history) who delighted in telling us how wonderful in every wayb the Soviet Union was, how much delight, life and freedom could be found there. Evidence - such as the experienmces of those who had the misfortine to live there - were dismissed as looney tunes or fascist propaganda or some such. Somehow these flat earthers would never dream of living there themselves.This book is one such. Don't touch it with a barge pole.But do get Semyon Volkov's Testimony insteadI am amazed that fifteen years after the end of communism in Europe this intellectually bankrupt book is actually still available. It should be in the Black Humour section. It is certainly not scholarship."
1,"""Scholarship"" of this sort ----","-- reminds me of a line from ""Apocalypse Now""""You are an errand boy, sent by clerks to collect a bill.""To write 'from the library' as it were, and not interview those living who knew the man and his work and the times first hand, is to perpetrate a fraud."
4,Boucher could write 'em as well as pick 'em,"I was introduced to the name ""Anthony Boucher' when I happened upon a group of five mystery paperbacks in the mid 1960's grouped as ""The World's Great Novels of Detection."" Boucher wrote the intro to each book, and since three of the books in that series are among my favorite all-time reads (""Rim of the Pit"" by Hake Talbot, ""Cue for Murder"" by Helen McCloy and ""Green For Danger"" by Christianna Brand), I gained respect for Boucher's ability to choose mysteries for me. When I happened on this and a few of his other mysteries, I was naturally anxious to read them. They don't disappoint (although they don't soar to the heights of the three books mentioned above.) This one, involving a cult, is fun to read and has some impossible crimes to solve, in keeping with the Golden Age.(By the way, the other two books in that series were ""A Blunt Instrument"" by Georgette heyer, and ""Cat of Many Tails"" by Ellery Queen.)"
3,"Good Book unless you are ""in"" M&A",This book is fine for business owners looking to understand the M&A process. I was recently hired as an associte at a M&A firm. I have my MBA and found most information in the book to be elementary.
3,don't be misled by the book jacket,"As a book on physics, this is great. As a book on the most macro-predictions, this is great. But as a book on everyday prediction, the book jacket misrepresents. A reviewer is quoted as saying that the author ""explores the successes and limitations of the human ability to predict the future,"" and another as saying that this is a ""scientifically sound investigation of past, present, and future threats to human existence.""What ""threats"" is this reviewer talking about? The two pages that talked about the threat of nuclear war? The author's own introduction states that the book examines ""how relativity, quantum theory, chaos theory, complexity theory, cosmology, and other aspects of modern physics have affected our longstanding quest to comprehend our fate.""Don't expect this book to shed genuine insight into futuristic questions such as: what technologies will we have? what could send society back into the dark ages? what will come of those who are currently repressed?"
5,"Holy Rosary, pamphlet",What a lovely companion to teaching children the correct way to recite the Rosary. I found this to be thorough and enjoyable for varied ages. It also gives some background into why we pray the Rosary and the meditations involved. I have used other guides but have found this the best in leading children(age 7 and up)in their love of the Rosary.
1,buyer beware!,this picture is not what you are buying- Do you know what an escutcheon is? Better find out before you purchase this item. I have told both Amazon and the company that this is false advertising. I do not recommend you do business with this seller. Amazon was good enough to give me my money back that the seller would not do. I gave 1 star only because I could not give zero.
5,Best starter CD to start a CD collection.,"As a whole, easily the best album ever produced. All 18 tracks are absoulte classics and contains the reasonably hard to find Christmas In Hollis. DMC and Run bounce lyrics of each other to prefection and with Jam Master backing them up on the wheels of steel you will discover why RUn DMXC are the KINGS from Queens."
1,Disappointing,"As much as I enjoy Federico's compilation of tango music on his CD's (which I highly recommend), this DVD (as well as other two in the series) was a disappointment; probably the most worthless of an number of instructional videos (and live instructors) I've seen over 3.5 years."
2,works until the handle falls off!,"Used this measuring cup for about 2 years of occasional use. Hand-washed and put in top rack of dishwasher when dirty. Then when I was drying it, the handle fell off! I expect more for a $25.00 measuring cup!"
3,Got what i paid for,"Well, it certainly looks the part, and if you have long hair already like myself, then it's all good.If there was any dissapointments with this product it would be:1) no pokets on the trousers! dunno where i was meant to put my beer money2) the bottom of the top where it tied, had parted and needed to be stiched into place.3) was very thin material, not good if like me you are attending a christmas do (burr! cold!)"
4,Fantastic album,"I have listened to the arms for a few years now. I've always thought there was something special about their sound. The previous albums are great. Even so, I've always known that they could be even better. However, this album is a step in the right direction. The ""softer"" tracks that you heard on the previous release ""Greatest story..."" are blown away by kick ass punkrock anthems. Great, in my opinion.The only thing that I could possibly miss on this record is a song like ""Ramblin' boys of pleasure"". Not one song on this album really reaches that level. There are attempts though, like ""Jumping the shark"" and ""Beyond the embarrasing style"" for example.This album is filled with nice riffs and great, clever lyrics (as always when Lawrence Arms deliver). To sum up; ""Oh! Calcutta!"" is a solid punk/rock album from Lawrence Arms. Close to a 5 /5."
3,entertaining but not an uplifter,"This was a well done post-apocalyptic film about a small group of virus survivors and their interactions with a limited number of other survivors. The production values were high and the acting at the very least, good enough. The story was good too, albeit one that has been played out numerous times in what are probably better films. However, the movie is certainly worth a watch if you're a fan of this genre. Just be aware this is not an uplifting movie; there are far too many humanistic reflections for this to be a fun/lighthearted movie. Not that that's a bad thing, just be aware before you make your rent/buy decision."
2,Poor boring movie,I am glad I have never purchased this dog. The acting is fair but the movie is slow and never caught my attention. The death of one of the main characters was pretty bad. I rented this through Red Box and felt the $1 price was a waste.
3,Average post-apocalyptic thriller,"I think the one driving force for audience is Chris Pine in the lead role, whilst I didn't rate him much in ""Star Trek"", his acting talents shine through in this role. I like that he is not content in being cast in the typical Hollywood pretty boy roles, and plays the more aggressive, merciless survivor.The film focuses more on the relationships between people post-apocalypse, there is not much of a back story but I don't think this is a problem, as it does not make the film dull or hard to follow. I did find this entertaining, and tense in places, with a great support cast."
5,Must Read,"This book is awesome. It's an excellent explanation to how everything is connected. If you have any interest in math and cycles, you should read this book. It may lead to you things that you won't believe, but I'm confident that it's real based on other books I've read. Be open minded and you'll start to understand that there is much more to the universe than we see and believe.Read it!"
5,Awesome,The author shows the correlation between patterns in mathematics and how those patterns arise in nature. Who can refute this then? Only a fundamentalist materialist would find the correlation's between nature and math provocative.
4,Saline Nasal Irrigation (Jala Neti),"If you have chronic sinusitis like I do, you might want to try a technique from India called Saline Nasal Irrigation (or Jala Neti). It is the only thing that helped me.The book talks a lot about sinusitus, but I don't think it mentions Jala Neti. I heard the author interviewed on NPR by Terry Gross. She was explaining how irritants get into the nose, and the nose tries to flush them out with extra mucus, then went on to say that you then take antihistamines to dry up the mucus. This seems illogical, rather, go the other direction by flushing the nose deliberately by pouring salt water through it. Search Google for the phrase ""jala neti"" if you want to try it. If you are really ambitious, look up ""sutra neti"".I hope we can learn something from the people in India. Perhaps we could have learned someting from the people of Afghanistan or Iraq or Palestine but instead we bombed them and then whitewashed the media."
5,Perfect,"I've never listened to an EP as many times as I have this one. The thing that startled me most about it was that I liked the Neva Dinova songs more than the ones crooned by Oberst. As a fan of any band, I think you tend to gravitate to their songs more than any other, and I thought that would happen for this album. Not the case. It starts with Tripped, which may start to find it's way onto mix-tapes without you even realizing it, and ends with the last refrain of Spring Cleaning, guaranteed to be something you hum for the rest of the day. Some of the best work from both of these artists, and it sounds like they just worked so damn well together that it leaves you wishing for more colab work in the future."
3,shipment quantity lacking,"The product description is VERY misleading. ""Greens Plus - Green + High Protein Natural Flavor, 12 boxes"". What I got was 12 bars. In my opinion this is false advertising and should be delt with as such. I contacted the seller who has basically told me I'm crazy if they think they're going to send me 12 boxes, no matter HOW it was advertised."
5,Always check ingredients.. this one's a winner,"This bar uses whey protein ISOLATE. The best stuff. Not the useless and potentially harmful (for men) soy proteins.. not the lower quality and potentially harmful (for lactose intolerant folk) whey concentrate.. for once I've found a bar with the good stuff.It actually tastes quite palatable too. Here's the thing though, I didn't buy it through Amazon. The price here isn't so great. Trader Joe's sells the bars individually for less than what you pay for bulk here. Disappointed to see that, as I wanted to get a box of them for cheap.But anyway, it's worth the price. Other bars have made me feel sick after eating, these don't."
3,Great bar but hard to get delivered in an edible state.,"I have ordered this product twice online and both times the bars arrive in a state where they were really tough to eat. They may have melted a bit during delivery I guess. In the future, I would prefer to buy them from the store. The bar is a very healthy bar and I highly recommend it for the nutrition but I think when ordering this type of bar online, you are taking a risk."
1,Full of factual errors.,"This book should not be relied on for any academic papers or presentations. It has many errors, especially concerning the McMartin Preschool Case in the 1980s. The author appears to have bought into the ritual child abuse conspiracy theories of the 1980s. The book is well written, which makes it inherently more dangerous to the unsuspecting reader."
4,Unfortunatly...,"I am quite happy that I can find a book about German secret weapons on air, sea and land.Unfortunatly this book major focus on well known secret weapons like V1, V2 ME262... etc and near 50% of materials are talking about air weapons. The other like Air-Air-Missile, Ground-Air-Missile, Anti-Tank and Tank section only have some brief information. For some secret weapons, there is only text description available (sometimes quite brief) but without any plan draft or design drawing.Finialy, I don't agree that they put Tiger I and II as secret weapons. E100 tank is only described in few paragraphs and the other E series tanks are not covered.Also the infra-red weapons that used by German is not covered. I am very disappointed about this.I think the editor has tried his best. But I really waiting for another book which has more detail. In my opinions, this book is elementary level and good for all kind of people whom has not heard about secret weapons in before."
5,Memories,This was my daughters favorite when she was a little girl!! I got it for my grand-children & they love it!!
4,this book was ok,"In this book Elizabeth and Richard (the guy from the trip) start to go out and Jessica and salvador thinking he's using her,. It wasn't te best one I read but it was ok. I was suprised how well Jess and salvodor got along"
2,This book was ok,"This book was somewhat a disapointment after my Perfect Guy it didn't really focus on Jessica and Damon and Damon was hardly in the book, but if your into the Elizabeth Salvador relationship then you should definatly get it."
1,Save your money!,"I was thinking 'how bad can it be?' Well, it's bad. You might as well buy those little hand held attached to a string you can put around your neck at Wal-Mart. Another reviewer suggested that it might be OK for one person. NAHH! It's OK for one person if you put it about 12"" from your face. I would not buy this product if I were you."
1,This thing sucks.,"Sorry, I just don't know any other way to put it. The on/off switch didn't work, it didn't move any air, and after 20 minutes, the blade fell off and wouldn't stay on anymore.What a waste -- I paid $17.99 at Sports Chalet for it. I sincerely wish that I hadn't."
1,NOT ANYTHING WHAT YOU THINK IT WILL BE.,I BOUGHT THIS FAN TO USE AT NIGHT WHILE CAMPING. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE FANS YOU BUY AT A FAIR TO USE ON YOUR FACE..........THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN POWER OR SIZE. BY AN O2 COOL FAN MUCH BETTER FR THE MONEY.
1,Degrades the volume level,"When you have two things, whether speakers or headphones, plugged in to this the overall volume is greatly decreased. In some cases this makes things too quite when at max volume.I unplugged my computer speakers and had just the headphones attached and I noticed that my left ear was quieter than my right. When I plug the headphones straight into the computer the volume issue was gone.Do not buy this."
1,"a good idea, a bad edition","Unfortunately, the author's distortion of St. Benedict's text through using inclusive language and the highly subjective interpretations of his rule from a feminist political perspective ruin this work. The author makes a historical error by asserting early on in the text that St. Benedict saw the anchoritic life as being self centered and less than the cenobetic life. This is not true. The Cenobetic life is the life in community where one is schooled in asceticism. But those few who can successfully leave and enter into the anchoritic life have entered into the final and highest stage of asceticism. I would recommend that reader's consult a scholarly and historical translation and study of St. Benedict's rule and then work through the text with a spiritual director who is orthodox in faith and practice."
2,"No quality, buy something else","Needs a better pysical description, only about 12"" tall and only the red lights work, definately not good quality and too much of a pain to ship back for the price. I recommend you buy something else."
3,Fontayne could dance forever,"I saw this movie in 1966 and found it wonderful. It was the only opportunity I ever had of seeing Nureyev dance with Fontayne, who was certainly the main motivation for his defection. The strength of the movie is in the fact that Fontayne is in her 40's when she dances this Juliet, but her wonderful dancing captures the lightness and youth of Juliet. I agree with Malkin, too many zoom-in shots prevent you from appreciating the ""blocking"" of the scenes (in ballet one creates a full picture for the audience), and it shows every wrinkle in Dame Margot's face. One kept wishing the cameramen had ""backed off"" so that the audience could appreciate the full impact of this performance. A film for those who prefer Prokofiev's score to Tschaikovsky's music."
5,Quantitative Evaluation,"Audio Merits:4/10; Video Merits:7/10; Scenario Merits:9/10; Overall Artistic Performance:10/10; Musical Merits:10/10; Cinematograhic Merits:8/10; DVD Extras:8/10; Recording Total Quality:9/10. Professor's Comment: The transfer process of the performance into digital medium is mediocre. However, Fonteyn and Nureyev exhibit a synergetic peak performance that makes the film a historical event. Perfect solos, magnificient partnership!"
1,Romeo and Julie,"Malo, malo, malo. Pésima grabacion y calidad sonora, teniendo en cuenta la calidad extraordinaria de los bailarines. No me explico como Amazon puede ofrecer este producto de tan poca calidad visual y musical."
1,Unbelievable!,"This was absolutely the most far fetched, ridiculously written book I have ever read in my life. After reading 2/3 of the way through I had to burn it in the campfire out of disgust. The dialog between the two main characters was so incredibly fake I couldn't stop laughing. I am shocked at how many people think Jance is a great writer."
4,Great for beginners & intermediates,"This book is aimed at everyone from beginners to strong intermediates, and all of those will learn a lot from it. My Yahoo hearts rating went up several hundred points after I read it. I wouldn't be dismayed that the master strength player who reviewed it didn't like it - he/she undoubtedly already knows what is in this book and needs a more advanced book (which doesn't currently exist). Playing online hearts, you hear some strong players screaming ""Always pass a low heart! Always cover your pass!"" What they want is for you to protect them against an opponent shooting, so they can win. This book will explain when and why to pass a heart and cover it, and when and why not to, among many other things."
4,3 books are missing,"I ordered 19 books, but only received 16 books. One more week was over, and I could not check out the status of the shipment. Also not able to find a help for it~~???"
4,Filthy/Gorgeous,"First off I am a big fan of Scissor Sisters I love their music and I find their music very up-lifting and I am only 15!! I have their import cd and this single...wich I only gave 4 stars because the ""Take Me Out"" remake is really not that good, I was expecting something more like ""Comfortably Numb"" but instead they come out sounding very country! But the filthy gorgeous remixes are good... The remix for Filthy/Gorgeous [I Love You- See You Next Tuesday Mix] is not the whole song it's just a techno rhythm with british people talking and laughing and you hear gorgeous and some moaning and more talking but its very entertaining! 4 Stars because of the TAKE ME OUT remake"
1,Zoo Med Turtle Clean 318,"Very small filter, not sure why it's rated for up to a 30 gallon tank. I have one small (about a 4 inch shell) red eared slider in a 20 gallon tank with about 10 gallons of water, the filter could not handle 1 day. I still have it in the tank but I use a Rena xP2 canister filter."
3,Honest Biography of a dissappointed Student,This is a book written by someone who was naive enough to believe in Maoist principles. However the book provide a good insight into the changes that China has seen. But the prespective is always one from the student who keeps trying to believe in the Maoist China. The book doesnot provide a historical prespective of China but rather a students prespective and it is also very Beijing Centric. It does not cover regions outside of Beijing. One thing that one does see is the failure of Maoism and how the leadership in Beijing changes and how the principles conveniently change with the leadership. Also the book covers the student riots for democracy which give one the impression that democracy resides in China and is bursting to be let out. In general this is a good book that I would recommend for someone who is interested in the very honest Biography of Ms. Wong a general understanding of how China (in specific Beijing) has changed over her time in China.
5,Informative and Entertaining,"My husband and I are in the process of reading this book together, and are thoroughly enjoying it. Wong tells her story with candor and humor, never neglecting to describe the horrors and failings of the revolution while also making sure to relate the positive, uplifting, and sometimes humorous aspects of the system. An enlightening read with unique perspective."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Jan Wong has a succinct and journalistic style. She fluidly describes her changing beliefs in response to the developments in China since the Cultural Revolution. Her descriptions of the people encountered, her work as a journalist, and political events are particularly gripping accounts. This is a fast moving yet richly detailed book."
2,Works but not the Best,Gave it two stars because it did covers the gray and blends in with my hair color. But its very greasy/wet feeling just using a small amount. Like other reviews it doesn't dry and if you touch your hair the color comes off onto your fingers. Will not be purchasing again.
3,spend a little more and buy a hose with quick on/off,the on off on this hose is very strange you have to unscrew the knob to let the air out and then screw it all the way back in to close it. spend a little more and buy a hose with a quick on/off
1,The Wrong VHS,"Don't buy this VHS if you are trying to get the 1949 movie at Amazon's IMDb subsidary. Instead they they will send you an Australian documentary about floods.Even worse, you may get caught up in Amazon's bureaucracy like I have. Weeks later, Amazon has still not credited my account for sending me the wrong VHS even though I returned the VHS within a few days of receiving it-and unopened too."
4,Call the Cohens...,"The Cohen brothers could make a great film out of this mile-a-minute roller coaster. I used to marvel at people who had the time or inclination to sit down and read a novel in one or two sittings. I checked this one out of the library and returned it in two days. I was captivated from the start and could not put it down. If you are into crazed-adrenalin-infused-holy-crap books, give this one the once over."
4,Coleman heater,"I have had this little heater for over one year. The first time I used it was in a tent trailer and it was a bad experience.The heater stunk the whole trailer with a strong pungent oil odor. The trailer was cold to begin with and I had to open the door and windows to air it out. Some camping friends with experience with these type of heaters explained you needed to burn off the oil residue in the heater to get rid of the odor. I burned one 16oz can on the heater outdoors overnight and this got rid of the oil odor. My advise with this heater is to try it out first at home in the garage or another outside building and break it in before taking it with you on a camping outing.Aside from this initial bad experience, this is a great little portable heater that suits my camping needs."
2,Safety issues,"My first time out, I ran this several hours overnight, and was overall quite satisfied. It took the chill off my camper, which was all I was looking for. In the morning, I turned it off for about half an hour or so, while I had my tea and puttered around. I then tried to re-light it. It's a bit hard to tell if it's going or not, so I kept my eye on it--and it's a good thing I did, because the molded plastic case that surrounds the heating element had caught on fire. By the time I figured this out, ther was nothing to do but throw it out into the rain. So buyer beware--and don't try to re-light it after running it for several hours, I guess is the moral of the story."
2,broke after a week,I purchased this as a small heater to heat my VW baja bug in the mountains of colorado during the winter. It worked great at home but as soon as I needed it to work at about -5 It wouldnt light. Now it works but it takes forever to light with a lighter and puts out about 1/5 of the heat it did when it was new. Get a heater that will work when you really need it to.
2,Not what I thought it would be,Was indicated that it had an ignite switch but did not have one had to manually light it. Was disappointed in product.
1,Requires you to have fire to light it,Nowhere in the description does it say you must provide your own source of flame to light it. Even the manual tells you to push the ignite button. But there is none. And the model number on the heater is exactly the model number on the manual. That is critical information. When was the last time anything was made without an ignite button? Once I realized mine does not have the button I found that Amazon sells one for three dollars more that comes with the button. Somebody please look out for us customers who are trusting you to help us make informed buying decisions. The three dollars is nothing compared to counting on a product that is sadly missing a feature that is expected these days.
4,heater,was very pleased with heater..works well...would reccomend this product to a friend...the only promblem that i had was a defective product...but thy replaced it ...i got the new heater within 2 days...but it is a good product..
4,Coleman SportCat,"I purchased this heater for my tent just to add a bit of luxury to my camping experience. Like all Coleman products it served me well. Easy to light, and it maintained constant heat output. Well built, compact and easy to use and as usual the service and shipping through Amazon and the seller was second to none. I'm actually starting to move more of my purchasing to Amazon.. What can I say, it works..Coleman SportCat PerfecTemp Catalytic Heater"
3,Camp Heater,"For the most part, the heater was easy to use, it did go for about 14 hours on one propane tank and was easy to light. It also stood sturdy on its own inside the tent BUT I did not think that it had heated my tent enough. We were still cold."
1,Didn't do what it was intended to do,"Bought this to simply heat up a 10X10 shack when we went camping. It was about 20 degrees outside, and after several hours, the warmest it got in the shack was about 30 degrees. The only heat you could feel was if you put your hand directly over it."
5,hero hawk and open hand,"A wonderful compliation of articals and superior photographs that covers the subject in an entertaining way.It is an absolutly beautiful book, good size, with fine printing and color as well as being extremley well researched and written.This level of presentation would be hard to improve upon."
1,"uh,","you've got to be kidding me. Almond cookie, smelled more like scented toilet paper and Jean Nate that never wears off. Don't be fooled by the other reviews."
3,A little more info.,"Since Amazon couldn't be bothered with an actual synopsis, I got this from IFC's website. [...]A breakout selection of the midnight section of Cannes in 2010, BLACK HEAVEN is directed by an exciting new French filmmaker called Gilles Marchand. The story (featuring a terrifically sexy young cast) follows an innocent young kid, Gaspar (Grégoire Leprince-Ringuet of LOVE SONGS), who, becoming enamored with a mysterious/gorgeous girl (Louise Bourgoin, THE GIRL FROM MONACO), is lured into ""Black Hole"" - a dark, obscure video game world of avatars with deadly serious intentions in the real world."
4,Internet meets psycho,"First this is a very well produced film. That actors are good as the plot and the plot is very good. Very neice glimpse into modern French youth, as in twenty somethings, culture mixed with a death cult of sorts."
1,I don't believe this!!!,"It is unbelievable that anyone who is remotely intelligent can possibly say this film is even decent at best. This film is unbelievably rotten, from the acting all the way to the script. The fact it was even made gives reason as to why sucides seem to some as the possible way out. I once had swiss cheese and the experience was similar to watching Balance of Power, and that's where you should file this movie under...cheese."
2,Okay you can put down the crack pipe,"In our world it took Lincoln and the Union 4 years of terrible war and TOTAL MOBILIZATION to defeat the CSA. That is a fact. Now Conroy has a Novel where the Union beats the Brits, Canada, and the CSA in one year. Is something wrong here. Okay Okay its just a story, a fantasy, hey the guys just writting a book. Well maybe so but can you make a little more realistic. Was it possible for the Union to win such a war ? Not at all likely but yes possible. Was it possible for the North to win such a war in one year. Hell No !!! Waite..just maybe.. if Lee was smoking crack."
1,Utterly Predictable and poor overall,"The historical improbabilities have been covered in other reviews but what killed this book for me more than anything was the Rah-Rah ""USA! USA!"" bias. As an American (and Northern for the record) I would obviously like to see 'my side' win but this book paints almost everyone & everything Southern/Canadian/English as incompetent, arrogant, ignorant etc. Once the antagonists have painted as obviously inept again and again the story becomes very predictable. (To put it in context, the Star Wars movies wouldn't have been terribly interesting if Darth Vader had been a complete putz.)My only thought was that this was the only way the author could overcome the historical inaccuracies that so many others have mentioned.Save your money and just as importantly your time for a better read."
2,What a Let Down....,"I love 80's slasher films and when I heard of ""The Sleeper"" being a throwback to those days, it instantly grabbed my attention. I couldn't wait to pop this film into my DVD player but upon viewing it was definitely a let down. The acting was bad, didn't care for the way it was filmed and the concept and look of the killer could have been done much better. Some of the killings were a bit gruesome but looked totally generic. This film is no doubt a rip off of ""The House on Sorority Row"" and ""Black Christmas"". Not even worth watching, a total disappointment."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"I was expecting a book with the same quality of storytelling found in the Belgariad and in Belgarath the Sorcerer. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The book started off great, but slowly went downhill. Certain parts seemed inconsistent and silly. The book just didn't portray Polgara as the regal and mature figure that was developed through the Belgariad."
3,"Good, but not great!","After reading literally everything Eddings has written, I was every so slightly dissappointed in this one. It just kind of dragged on. Polgara is obviously her own greatest fan. I am almost tempted to say that Eddings should have ended this series with ""BELGARATH THE SORCERER"". Still, if you loved the ""BELGARIAD"" and the ""MALLOREAN"" as I did, I guess you owe it to yourself to read this one too."
2,You'd rather read the Belgaraid again,"I have been a David Eddings fan for a long time, but this book has sorely disappointed me. It's long and dreary, with an awfully cliched style of writing and humour. Without telling you anything new, it goes on and on in a rambling tone about Polgara's ""lengendary"" travels. I was bored before I reached the end."
2,Stale and disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I am a big fan of Eddings', the Belgariad and his other fantasy series. As I started the book, it was interesting, particularly in the development of the ongoing Arendia problem and Polgara's handling of it. However, after that the book lost it's way and became a documentation of events rather than a rich story. I get the feeling that David and Leigh lost patience with this book and were anxious to finish the series."
2,Pretty Pointless,"Yes, I liked the first 5 books. I felt the next 5 were milked for all they were worth (the story could have been told in 2 volumes without all the padding). Belgarath's story was pretty interesting. BUT this last one is disappointing. The only new thing to tell was Polgara's stay in Arendia, which reads a lot like a Harlequin romance. There are lots of inconsistencies among these books, especially in describing the magical powers. Sometimes magic can do certain things, and sometimes it can't. Another point that has always bugged me is: shouldn't it be Beldurnik now that Durnik is a disciple?"
2,NOT as hot,"David Eddings is an extremly creative, insightful, and appealing writer for those who wish to wander in a fantastic adventure environnment. All thought, of all the books I've read from him... this one does not reach out and touch the grandur of its predicessors. Too bad... Belgarath the sorcerer facinated me, his daughter did not. Faux pas, Mr. Eddings."
5,An excellent story about Polgara and her life!,"How did Polgara become a soceress? Read this book and it will enthrall you to the end. I was not able to put it down. This book tells in ""Polgara's"" words how she became a Dutchess, a sworn protector of the Rivan descendants, a dancer, and kept a secret from her famous father,Belgarath. Very well done!!!"
2,yawn and yawn again,"God, I've been waiting for this book.I've enjoyed the Belgariad and Malloreon very much and read the books several times.I liked the quick wit, the humorous exchanges between the characters, and the plot. But ""Polgara"" left me disappointed, rewriting that already twice told long story of what Pol and Belgareth did during 3000 years when noting much of a plot happend, before the actual series (Bel/Mal) started. Just adding the angle of Polgara's perception is definately not enough to salt this journal-of-a-time-of-waiting. It has little entertaining value, and a somewhat shrill lack of those peculiar grins that swept my face reading the Bel/Mal.There is so much more that can be done with the good set of characters the Eddingses created in the Bel/Mal. I do hope they start a NEW plot/series with them."
2,A poor excuse to breath life into a dying cash cow...,"This book was long winded. It takes thing that should have been simple and goes on and on about them. Being a big fan of David Eddings, I have read the belgarion/mallorean/elenium/tamuli countless times and have enjoyed them all. This whole book, however, was almost like filler. I think everything contained in this book could have been squeezed into ""Belgarath the sourcerer"" with most of the same effect. On the whole, Mr. Eddings might consider going back to the Elenium/Tamuli and telling us whether or not Ulath took king Sarak's bones back home, if Kalten cut up the nobleman who had assaulted his soon-to-be wife and if Stragen ever catches Elron (Along with krager's demise). THAT I would happily be the first in line to buy!"
3,Ho-Hum,Didn't learn anything - all it really did was get to reaquaint you w/ the characters. I could have done that by re-reading the first 10 books.
4,Terrific,"I enjoy this book. This is my second copy. I have re-bought all of the Eddings series as they have worn out over the years. I prefer Belgarath the Sorcerer, but I cant read that without reading this immediately after."
5,like the people you know,"Gangsters doesnt idealize real life or provide fluff and sap for the storybook-ending reader. It is a real novel about real people who, like the people you know, don't have it all figured out and do have inconsistencies and are deeply complicated. That is why it is such a great read--the characters are all so well developed that they remind you of your best friends, your old boyfriends, your ex-husband, or your nemesis. Zimroth adds the religious dimension proving that she is not only an insightful reader of human character but also an intellectual, and this dimension adds to the complexity of her characters and their dilemnas."
5,This book should not be missed.,"My 10 year old daughter and I read this together and we both loved it. The author does a wonderful job of creating the real feelings of a 8-9 year old girl and demonstrates how a young girl slowly learns to trust herself in doing what is right, even though it is scary. The 1920's South Carolina setting is wonderfully created. This would be a perfect read aloud book to a class of fourth or fifth graders."
4,"Overall, Kleenex ColdCare is a good product. I ...","Overall, Kleenex ColdCare is a good product. I liked that they're nice strong tissues -- nice and thick. The eucalyptus scent was very nice also. The tissues were very soft to my nose, and I liked how they came out of the box still folded. That makes it easy to get a couple and stick them in your purse. I have to fold or just wad up OTHER tissues when I need to take a couple with me. I'm positive that I'll be purchasing this product in the future."
2,"While these tissues are extremely soft and absorbent, ...","While these tissues are extremely soft and absorbent, the addition of menthol actually lessens their practicality, as they cannot be used near my eyes. When I have a cold, my eyes get very watery; using these tissues for whatever small, temporary positive effect the menthol might have on my breathing would mean keeping a second box of tissues at hand to dab my eyes. Regular tissues in conjunction with some VapoRub or a decongestant seems a much better solution. This isn't a product I would buy or recommend."
4,I liked this product a lot. My biggest ...,I liked this product a lot. My biggest problem is that a lot of other tissues were ripping in half as they came out of the box. These will be great for those stuffy noses in the wintertime.
2,"Strange, very strange...","We didn't buy this game, but rented it. I suggest doing that first before buying. It's very odd. The thing that bothered me the most was all of the talking that goes on. It's a bit tiresome. I guess it is a good use of the Wii features, but I wouldn't buy it."
1,Here's a real bargain for those who love Al Hirt,"I have 2 copies of this album on CD with different covers. This cover is much nicer of Al. I don't know if this is a rerelease of an older album of Hirt's or if it did come out orginally in 1996. The music is not as great or as crafted as his RCA albums I have heard, but none the less there are some really great tunes covered as only Al can do them, soft, yet sexy pop jazz. I play this one often. Jazzin' At The Pops is yet another good bargain with good tunes worth the money. There isn't much done by Al that isn't worth the money. Give us more Al Hirt Cd's Please!!!"
5,A must buy for any fan,"I ordered this for my mom who is a huge Scooby-doo fan.She loves it and for any fan of the show, this is where to start your collection."
5,great dvd set,"my kids (ages 3) completely love scooby - but i didn't want them watching the commercials on t.v. - this dvd set was the perfect rememdy for that - the shows are back to back and super-great - the girls just LOVE them and i love remeniscing back to all the old episodes! our favorite episodes: ""Foul Play in Funland"" and ""Scooby Doo and Mummy too!"""
4,Classics never die,"this a great dvd collection. If you want to relive your childhood a little bit and enjoy a thoughtfully put together series collection, this is an excellent choice for you. I love it. I was a big fan of the original scooby doo though. These are the first 2 seasons of scooby doo. this is where it all began. if that's what you want, this is where to get it. I have fully enjoyed it."
5,Scooby Doo Where Are You!! dvds,I bought the dvd's for my 3 year old grandson and he loves them. He loves Scooby Doo and has been watching them continuously since he opened them up on Christmas Day. The classics are always the best.
4,Scooby Doo First second season,"The video arrived in good time the package was slightly cracked, but no problem with the DVDs."
5,Zoinks!,"Our Great Dane got this for our 3 year old for xmas and it the only thing he wants to watch. I would say some kids this age might get freaked out by the creatures, but our kid kind of loves being freaked out. He wanders about the house singing the theme, but also the other songs, which are fabulous. He has also found a deeper relationship with the dog, who isn't terribly unlike Scooby."
3,Scooby Doo,"The DVD is pretty good. However the episode that I was looking for that I was led to believe was included is not included. Had I known that I would never have purchased this item. Don't get me wrong. I like it. It just didn't have what I was looking for...the episode ""Scooby Doo Where's The Crew?"""
2,over-priced,"Wal-mart has it for $20 and the bonus is that it is new, not used. I was really bummed whenI found out I was beuing jipped"
2,More fluff than substance.,The book was a very basic overview of the modular construction process with a few pictures to supplement. It was not worth the money.
1,i want my money back.,"probably, the writer doesn't have any background of architecture. i am very disappoited."
4,Good Movie,"Steve plays Jim, a border patrol agent who moves from Texas to Montana to raise his teenage daughter who he does not have the best of relationships with. When Jim's (STEVE AUSTIN) teenage daughter is kidnapped by some ruthless killers, he's forced to lead the killers into the wilderness to retrieve their share of a missing heist score. I was disappointed their was not more action in the film, but overall worth a rent. I did find it better than The Stranger."
1,"Horrible, manipulative, does damage to the cause of Christ","This book, along with anything else written by C.S. Lovett, is a terrible, evil example of evangelism. The author cites specific techniques to manipulate people into making a serious decision. The ""evangelist"" walks away thinking he's done good for the Kingdom. The ""convert"" walks away feeling bruised, bullied, confused, and glad it's over. This is a great technique if you want numbers. It is a horrible technique if you want changed lives. There is no magic prayer that makes you a Christian. Repeating some words because somebody put their hands on your shoulder and said, ""Repeat after me. Lord... I'm... a sinner...,"" doesn't make me a Christian any more than reading Marx outloud makes me a communist."
3,Great concept and illustrations marred by uninspired text,"We purchased this book because of the charming cover picture, its premise, a stuffed bunny on an adventure around the world, and the fun of opening the letters inside. While the illustrations were very cute, I was disappointed with the writing, which I found bland and totally lacking imagination. I give it three stars because my son enjoys the pictures and opening the letters, but now I create my own story line to go along with it. This could have been done much better; it's a shame."
1,last updated in 1988,"I needed a decent French-English dictionary, and I thought that this book would be a good one. I was completely wrong. This dictionary was last updated in 1988 instead of 2005. And it does not even have ""Internet"" for its headword. I would recommend Larousse dictionaries instead."
2,Not what I expected!,"I was expecting deeper level of information from this book and I didn't get it. This book covers many topics, but not enough deep level of information."
2,False advertisement,Do not waste your money on this item. It states that you will receive three different rings and that's a lie. I got mine in the mail today and opened the box and all three were the same. I was disappointed even though it's only five dollars which is still a deal. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I haven't tried them out yet so I can't say anything about that part. But the material looks very cheap and the ring itself is small so I'll probably have to cut it down some so that my boyfriend can put it on. Bottom line is that it's false advertisement. Next time I'll just go with Doc Johnson and spend a few extra dollars.
2,God Forbid really must be Gone Forever.,"Yes, the album title is quite appropriate because everything that made this band amazing on previous releases (the shining example being Determination) is far beyond gone. God Forbid traded all of their originality for popularity and a new streamlined sound. Gone are the amazing and catchy two-part guitar harmonies and the incredible breakdowns. Gone are the amazing lyrics that used to accompany thier music. Gone are God Forbid as far as I'm concerned.I gave this album two stars for effort. The band is still and incredibly talented band, and I can respect the risks involved in introducing clean vocals into music that used to have almost none. The vocals are quite impressive, and the instrumentalists are still rather talented. This album is far too streamlined and hackneyed for this fan. If you want to hear a really stellar album, check out Determination."
1,Generic Lyrics,Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out.
5,Pure 100% American Metal,Like the little sticker said on the plastic its 100% American metal and in your face..I originally bought the ep and could not wait for the whole cd and guess what its unbelievable...from the first track to the end these guys dont give up the just keep dishing out pure metal...So if your a fan of lamb of god or slayer you should definetely pick this one up you won't be disappointed...2004 is the year 4 Metal fans....
1,Don't Buy It!,We bought this unit last year and have gone through two trigger guns and now have another broken one. The hose connection on the trigger gun is a terrible design and it always breaks at the connection. The unit doesn't get a lot of use but it seems like another rite of spring here is to get a new trigger gun for the Karcher. The connections are also non-standard so you can't replace their hose and trigger gun with an after market unit. We wasted our money! We'll never buy another Karcher unit.
1,Lousy Company,The unit was delivered with a broken on/off switch. I called Karcher and their only remedy was to send me a rebuilt unit! A rebuilt unit for a brand new unit! I immediately boxed it up and sent it back to Amazon. If that's how they treat all customers I'm surprised they are still in business.
1,i really really wanted to like this book,"unfortunately, it's a really superficial analysis of an important movement. it doesn't go into the ambiguities of hip hop (like its issue with sexism) or even why, exactly, the civil rights movement is no longer relevant. there are no stats, no citations, no nothing. it's a very long, very passionate essay written by someone who really just had enough solid research to write a 3 pager but stretched it out over a few chapters.i was really, incredibly disappointed -- i really wanted this book to go into hip hop as a political force, to discuss the mtv rock the vote campaign, and the emergence of nh2ed, and instead it was like ""thugs are cool! mlk is lame! wheeeeeeeeeee!"""
2,Not a great resource,"This dictionary definitely has some interesting words and the appropriate definitions, but it is not very comprehensive. I purchased the book last week and several words I tried to look up were not listed: ecumenical, for starters. Please excuse my spelling of ecumenical, because I don't have a real dictionary with me at the moment.Purchase this book only if you intend to keep it right next to a real dictionary, and in that case you might not need it."
3,"Fun, but not useful","This book is for word buffs. It does not make a great reference book, since it just lists lots of words that you could find in a real dictionary. And it doesn't work well as a thesaurus, either. (See the author's other works.) However, if you are looking for a word that has a certain sound, or if you are curious about the difference between two similar words (like apprise and appraise), this is handy book. Also, if you want to create an insult for someone, it's a neat resource to have available. For instance, these insults are listed in the introduction: ""grandiloquent popinjay, venal pettifogger, nefarious miscreant, flagitious recidivist, sententious blatherskite, mawkish ditherer, arrant peculator, irascible misanthrope, hubiristic narcissist, feckless sycophant, vituperative virago, vapid yahoo,"" and so on. It gets to be fun. Too bad it could not be more usefully organized."
3,homeowners,"Good to keep around the house,would last about a week on a jobsite.Pretty much a nice variety of dollar store drill bits a throw away screwdriver but if your tools are at work this will do."
2,Cheap in every way.,"I bought this so I could have some ""throw away"" drill bits for the times I know I'm going to break a bit. Unfortunately, it doesn't have that many drill bits, and the drive bits are stuff you already have, and multiple of the same ones."
1,Thought she was going to break from her pattern,"But she didn't.This is the first novel of SEP where I thought maybe the guy would fall in love first.But OF COURSE NOT. It's the girl who has to have the hopeless love first. Then he graciously manages to fall in love with her, and it doesn't ring true.The pattern she writes is over and over the same thing: plainish girl (pretty but no knock out) meets big celebrity guy who can have any woman he wants. She falls in love with him and realizes she can't have him, because, of course, he can have any woman and won't settle for just her.Then miraculously he decides he loves her in the last couple of chapters."
4,Natural Born Charmer,Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a gifted author. Good story lines. Always humorous. I try to purchase every novel Ms Phillips writes.
5,Bravo,"I just put down this book and I feel almost stunned at the beauty and complexity of this story. SEP is the absolute best at this type of writing -- unsurpassed wit, humor and drama all mixed to create yet another masterpiece.Yes, once again we get extremely flawed characters with major emotional issues. But isn't that what SEP does so well? In a way, it's like reading a great mystery and trying to figure out how the seemingly mismatched pair will fall in love amidst the background of events that shaped their personalities.It is all the more heartwrenching to include the extended family and seeing those wounds healed. I must say I was surprised at the twists and turns this book took as each character was introduced.Like Blue, SEP is truly a word artist as she paints us picture after beautiful picture of relationships in all their pain and glory. Do not miss this wonderful book!"
4,iTouchless bag re-sealer Works great,"I purchased the 2 pack of the bag re-sealer and have used it for a month. The batteries in the first unit seemed to run down quickly. And when they do, the re-sealer won't seal. But with fresh batteries, it works like a charm and saves me money on bagged veggies. They do not spoil as fast. Would buy again."
4,Seals if done right,"This product seems very easy to use and should be, however, it is tricky to get a consistent line to seal from edge to edge. I am still playing around with it to figure out an easier way. When done right it definately seals and keeps your chips fresh longer then just rolling and using a chip clip would. I would recommend for sure, but remember that practice makes perfect on its use."
5,re-sealer,"i had the euroseal and they all work the same. don't know what type of problems anyone has been having, but i haven't had any problems. works the way it should and it doesn't use up the batteries unless it's being used. it's a pressure switch, so having the brown plastic go over the heating mech. stops it from accidentally heating up."
2,Don't wast your money,"These work okay if you're very, very careful. But I found that for practical daily use, they are pretty useless. Air still enters the bags. I don't use them anymore."
1,Color Cartridge Failed Out of the Box,"Thought it was an excellent price for two cartridges, so I bought them to hold in reserve for when my current cartridges ran out of ink. When that day finally arrived, the color cartridge only sprayed a faint yellow mist on the paper, even after 'cleaning' and 'priming' the cartridge with the HP utility. I didn't even bother to try the black cartridge. Admittedly, the cartridge sat on the shelf for about 10 weeks before I tried it, but I would hope that wouldn't have had an effect.Guess I learned my lesson about refilled cartridges."
3,Good price; acceptable value.,"These re-manufactured cartridges are in use on my hpdeskjet 920c. The black ink works quite well. The Tri-Color cartridge tends toward bluish printing of photos. I like the price on the pair, as having both black and white and color does allow some use of color when needed for accent or to print graphics other than photos. Instructions for installation were very minimal. I expect to reorder. The shipment came promptly, even though it was shipped super-saver."
1,HP 15 Black & HP 78 Tri-Color,I received my order today and very disappointed because the HP 15 & HP 78 does is not recognized in my printer. I don't recommend anyone buy these refurbished cartridge. As one buyer wrote you get what you pay for.
2,Remanufactured Ink Cartridges,They both worked for a while but the color cartridge soon dried out requiring that I purchase both of them again. I won't be using remanufactured cartridges again.
2,Horrible,This cartridge only worked a few times. They are horrible. The color never was as good quality as the name brand cartridges are. I think I was able to print just a few times and then no color at all. I would not recommend this items.
3,"small, quiet, light-duty","This filter does a decent job for smaller tanks (under 20 gallons), but if you have a turtle or a larger tank, pass on this filter and buy a Finnex 360. It's only about 4 dollars more; the Finnex is much more robust. It makes the Zoo Med 501 look like a toy filter."
1,Cheap-stopped working!- worth a try good customer service,"It's cheap junk- DO NOT BUY!!!!! very disappointed.I ordered this based on good reviews here- we have had this for less than 6 months,one tiny turtle tank. It's stopped working 2-3 times, we always manage to get it running again. The parts are already wearing out- which accounts for the reason it stops for no reason,till the handyman of the house fiddles with it and gets it moving again. We keep it clean,and check it daily,trying to keep it alive.If you don't have a handyman to coddle it along,you will be even more disappointed than we areEdited to add..good company,paid to return,they repaired item so we're good,they stand behind their warranty!!!!"
3,Got this for my Fluval Chi.,"For its price I guess it is OK.Problems:Tough to clean, there are no E-Z Disconnects for these hoses so you have to take them off of the tank every time to clean.The hoses to get build-up in them after a week or two and this can decrease flow so ya have to clean often.The design of the canister doesn't seem to encourage water to flow THROUGH the filter media but rather go above it. I took out the plastic separator and drilled holes in it so water would flow through my carbon and into the filter media on the other side. It still isn't perfect but I guess I'm doing enough for a 6 gallon tank.I would have rather waited for a better small canister filter to go on sale but oh well, got this one and it hasn't been all that bad. Messy to clean but hasn't leaked a bit and is still going strong after a few months. For any other Fluval Chi owners out there looking for an improved filter this will work just fine if you want to keep the cost down."
2,tank needs cleeaning every week!,"I bought this filter, use the activated charchol and the water stays clean for about 3 days. At 1 week, its beyond dirty. I was looking for a filter that I could clean the tank about 2X a month. I have 1 6 in red ear slider in a 20 gal long tank. If anyone knows how to get better performance, PLEASE let me know!!!"
1,Doesn't do the job...PERIOD,"It just doesn't do it. The product it says it works up to ""30 gallon"" tanks, mine is 20.Maybe it helps with the pH stuff, but the water was cloudy about 2 days later, there is dung everywhere that it doesn't pick up. I am going to have to try to return this now and get a stronger one, and from a different company, because after further research, many people say that these filters just don't workNOTE: I got this for pet turtles, which are dirtier then fish, so maybe it is good enough for fish, but I wouldn't even risk it, this thing sucks."
2,Falling short of his amazing potential,"Ryan Adams penned excellent tunes while he was with Wiskeytown. Since then he has written several excellent songs but the majority felt rushed and/or incomplete. Rather than spewing them out in rapid succession, which he certainly has a talent of doing, he should work a little longer on refining and completing his ideas. This album is just another example of his apparent listening to producers and star-struck fans who are encouraging him to produce quantity at the expense of quality. True, there are a few good tunes here but nothing to the level of work with Wiskeytown. If you are satisfied with initial impressions of ideas rather than complete expression, this may be for you. Myself, the overall sense is one of overall disappointment and letdown, again."
4,big-bulky,"the bag is bigger than I expected- I plan to use it in my R1 ride to Sturgis this year- I had to write repeatedly to get some form of instructions from the company with I finally got in about 8 weeks after I bought this bag. I'm going to try to play with it this week with the instructions- if I don't like it or it's too bulky, I'll get a full refund."
4,The Other Public Side of Eudora Welty,"Most of us know Eudora Welty as a writer of Southern fiction, marked by regional dialect, mysterious characters, and absorbing stories. Ms. Welty's photography is another reflection of her sensitive, intuitive nature. She captures in images the essence of life in Mississippi just as she captured it later in her writings. The reproduction is not superlative, but one does get an adequate representation of her work and its intent. Those who know photography intimately and those with a passing interest will all find this book immensely satisfying."
4,A Fascinating Look at Pre-war Mississippi,"This collection of photographs vibrantly brings to life a bygone era in Mississippi. As a former resident of the state Ms. Welty photographed, I found this book to be an indispensible document of a life now gone (for better and worse). The simplicity and beauty of the featured photographs move me almost as much as the author's fiction. While we do not remember Eudora Welty for her photographs, I find it hard to be disappointed with them. I can only find fault with the volume's brevity. This book would be a wonderful addition to any collection."
2,Save your time,"This book is a preparation guide, only tell you some tricks but nothing else. This 'book' only have two review question for subject. If you are an expert user of Windows 2K Server maybe this book can help you, if you don't , save you time.I prefer the MCSE: Windows 2000 Server Study Guide from Sybex, that book really help me to pass the exam."
5,one a the best books ihave read,"this is a book about a childrens home where i grew up brought back alot of memories and i loved the book wish there was an updated book ,,, like one from the 80's til now..."
2,Poor information.,"I regret to report that some information is missing, vague or incorrect thus this book is not worth your time and money."
4,Great singing,"Johnny and Deniece are both great vocalists, and even though they shine on several of this CD's songs, some of the material is less than stellar. Still worth the price for ""Too Much, Too Little, Too Late"" though. mg"
3,LaCrosse Alphaburly 1000g Boots,"I have worn these boots several times and seem to meet the advertisedstandards. I have not worn them in colder weather. The only negatives arethe strong rubber smell and not having the choice of a wider boot. ( UPDATE) I have used these bootsand am satisfied, they kept my feet dry and are fairly comfortable. They do notkeep your feet warm for more that an hour at temps below 35 deg. Footwarmers or covers are a must. The smell has dissipated."
1,Poor design,I wear a size 12 shoe and I ordered a size 13 boot. I couldn't even get my foot through the neck of the boot. Waste of time and money! They must run way to narrow.
4,Ready for winter!,"The boots were ordered from Amazon and are of very good quality. The only problem my husband had was they seemed to run just a little snug. After wearing them a few times, they seemed to stretch just a little. He loves the boots and believes they will last a long time."
3,Endearing B Western,"This neat little B western is typical of the sort of film that studios used to produce in quantity for kiddie consumption at Saturday matinees. When TV came along, they became the staple of Saturday morning at-home viewing.This film has a neat, simple plot and sticks well to the basics. What raises it above others is the work of the two stars --- Robert Mitchum and Barbara Hale who both went onto much bigger careers, he in a long string of A movies (Out of the Past is only two years off) and she as the Emmy-winning Della Street on TV's Perry Mason.Thurston Hall who had a career playing bankers, tycoons and senators gets a few laughs as Hale's father who sets out for the west on the advice of his doctor. Too bad ripe character acting like this went out of fashion. It enhances the movie considerably.It may not be Shane or The Shootist, but it is darn entertaining."
3,Cellex-C facial peel,"This is a great product, I am very pleased with the results. Not disappointed at all, pricey but worth it."
5,"Basic, but good stuff that sounds good to me.","Yes--this book is an overview of Carleton course but it also contains some good information and is very suitable for the newcomer to real estate. Carleton covers a lot of his famous ""No Money Down"" techniques and beats to deatht he success of his students. In that regard, it does resemble an advertisement, but if you have the testimonials, why not flaunt them?This book will not be enough to get your started in real estate investing. His course is far more complete. This book will get your interest. The course will make you wealthy. Use this book as an intro to real estate investing."
2,Uninspiring advertorial,"It had some adequate information on real estate investing, but was spoiled by continued attempts to sell his courses for more information. Money and time badly spent."
1,Fact,"A lot of complaints have been filed against Carleton Sheets' affiliate company American Marketing Systems, Inc. - a source right on this site. If that doesn't sound an alarm with you, then duh you probably are uneducated, inexperienced, and poor."
3,His scorn is too obvious,"As an ex-JW I have read a lot of books about the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. This isn't the best one. Not only do the author's scorn and bitterness weaken his writing (for instance an excessive use of quotation marks sprinkled freely on each page and a lack of editing), but it seemd to me he just doesn't have enough distance yet to have really healed. Make no mistake, JW's are definitely into mind control, and they are really cruel in many ways. But if you are an ex-JW looking for support and understanding, or a non-JW curious about this organization, a better book might be ""Visions of Glory."" Also, there is a wise website, virushead.net, with a more mature, compassionate response to the Watchtower organization."
2,Good effort,"Based on the reviews above, I expected to enjoy this book a lot more than I did. While the writing style was engaging and some of the characterization simply wonderful (loved her whipped cream fixation), it was just too hard to truly like this protagonist as a person. She'd done the right thing, yet her friend was upset. Instead of going to her friend, she figures she'll just do other things. She leaves town without even telling her sick mom where she will be. She seems to have some serious, unresolved issues with her past, but then we never learn what those things are. It was hard to relate. I also wished the mystery had been harder to figure out. Still, I like this writer's writing style and her wit and I will keep an eye out for her next book, only this time I may just get it at the library first."
5,Hear from the Author!,"Hear an interview with Clovis Incident author Pari Noskin Taichert on The Book of Life podcast's July 2007 episode ""Magic & Mystery,"" at www.bookoflifepodcast.com!"
2,Novel is weak overall,"Hosier's Mrs. Hudson series is very light and sometimes amusing. Sherlock Holmes never appears, although his presence is hinted at--a running joke that is the high point of the series. Otherwise, the mysteries are nothing new and the atmosphere (and any evidence of historical research) lacking. Worst of all, the series violates a cardinal rule of detective fiction, because Mrs. H. solves most of the crimes with the aid of sidekick Violet Warner's knack for using astral projection to project her hypnotized body into the suspect's apartment and the like. What's with that?!?"
4,Nice-looking set,"I've had this set for about 4 months now and so far they aren't too bad. I really like the color. I looked everywhere for blue to match my pattern. I'd say they are worth the money. If you do a lot of cooking that calls for a ""heavy"" saucepan, these aren't for you. I like to make candy around Christmas and these didn't work well for that. I also found that when I boil water in them, they still have marks on the bottom afterwards no matter how hard I scrub. Maybe that is just part of the seasoning process, though?"
3,Problematic but adequate.,"Surprisingly, adequate stair carpet protectors are difficult to find. These seemed perfect at first. Heavy vinyl with ""grippers"" to stay in place. Problem was, the front end that supposedly curves over the stair front is way too narrow and doesn't conform. ""Grippers"" don't really work, especially on velvet cut carpet. Ends stick up which could be hazardous to stair walkers. I solved these problems somewhat, by using a heat gun to soften plastic and conform to stair end. It helped a bit. I also used long tacks to fasten vinyl at the ends."
1,"Don't buy this! Defective cooling design.,","I really wanted this to work, since I need something exactly like this for my low profile HTPC setup. I saw the review in [...] where they panned this after it failed partway through their test. Thinking that it might just have been their unit or something, I bought one a couple weeks ago. Boots up fine, but about two minutes into running 3dmark03, the machine reboots itself! Basically, the passive cooling on this board doesn't work. Note, this wasn't even in my HTPC, but in a normal Antec case with plenty of fans cooling it. I replaced this with a (full height) passive X1600-based unit from Asus, and now have no problems. If you buy this card, you WILL regret it."
3,Missing PS/2 adapter,"The keyboard is a generic replacement for the stated Adesso part number, and did not come with the USB to PS/2 adapter as stated in the description. We purchased 4 of these based on the description, so had to go out and spend some more money to get the adapters.That said, once we had the adpaters there were no problems using the keyboard with SuperMicro SMP workstations."
1,broken item,half of the keys on the keyboard didn't work. Poor quality item. I ended up getting my money back.I bought a flexible keyboard for $14.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond the other day and it is better quality and works great.
2,Not as cool as you'd think,"I was very disappointed with this item. I had hopes for a small and portable keyboard...and this is not it. It has small touch sensors in the middle of each latex key, and you have to make sure and press down firmly for each letter. Avid typers don't do that, they peck the keys, and I do too. It's very very frustrating to use, and I feel like i wasted my money purchasing it."
3,"Works in a jam, but not for long term","I had finals coming up and couldn't afford a new laptop, or to borrow one. The keyboard of my laptop had 3 letters that stopped working, A, T and C. All of which I'm sure I would have needed for my exams so I bought this. It worked but you really had to push in the letters when typing-- just something to get used to."
4,Good but...,"I travel frequently for work and purchased this and an ergonomic tray to stop myself from slumping over my laptop. Some other reviewers talked about the stickiness of some keys on this keyboard and I agree with that. I find myself having to hit keys harder than I would on a normal keyboard. Although this slows down my typing time, it's not a deal breaker. I would much rather schlep this through airport security 2x per month than an actual keyboard. Also, I would recommend rolling this, rather than folding it in your bag. I noticed my keys began sticking once I folded it."
2,only good for highway travel,When I ordered this atlas I expected the large paperbacked atlas that I have seen in the past. These always gave large pictures of states and cities which allowed one to clearly see roads and highways. This version is so condensed that much of the road information is barely readable. Many of the cities are so tiny that it is hard to read anything but the most major roadways.This atlas has many gimmicks which may be helpful at times like airport maps. However it shortchanges one on the major reason for buying it.
5,Great Book - you MUST read it!,It is a very good story about a young blackfeet boy who's dreams come true. I recommend it for children age 8 to 16. I learned what it was like to grow up as a young blackfeet indian.
4,Coleman Campchair - Quality For The Money,"I purchased this chair as a replacement for an earlier model of almost the same type which had lasted me over 5 years with consecutive use.The old one had a hinge on the back rest that would fold down which provided a convenient carrying strap AND helped to prevent topples on windy days. When folded, it was easier to handle. The new one, while lighter in weight than the old one, does not fold like the old one and I miss the carrying handle.With exception of that missing feature, this chair seems to be well made and I hope to get lots of use out of it. Quality is something that I've come to associate with Coleman products."
2,Ron Jeremy contines to grasp for mainstream acceptance,"Having been interested in the adult film business since the late 70's I was hoping for a look behind the curtain from someone who been a primary in the industry for nearly 30 years. What I found instead was Ron Jeremy explaining how he's been cut out of mainstream movies, lots of name dropping(celebrities I have known), some personal history, and not very much about the adult film industry.Jeremy seems to be a really nice guy who's been lead by his d**k for most of his life. His longevity in the industry is not that big a deal, men who can perform on cue last forever in porn, it's the women who get chewed up and spit out in a couple of years.I bought the book on a cut out rack for under 4 bucks. At that price it was worth the money. Ron Jeremy, in my opinion, missed a chance to write what could have been a really interesting goo on the porn industry."
2,Pure Arrogance,"Though the book isn't awful, his ""I'm Greater-Than-God"" attitude is sickening. Yes, he leads an intersting life but to blow yourself up like that is pretty pretentious. The book isn't as good as I had hoped."
3,Just about sex,"I know that's a silly thing given the author but given he is a trained pianist, has a masters degree and has a wide variety of interests, I was expecting something more.As a porn star autobiography, it's well done but not what I expected."
5,Great!!!!!,I gave this as a gift for my boyfriend's son he had no cup holder in his car...He's very Happy with it.
3,"short run time, mediocre selection","only ten songs, so only a 30 min or so run time; and of the ten songs selected, i would say that half were great, the other half were mediacore background music with no oomph.."
5,Still Shining,"Even after Teddy Pendergrass, the most famous member left the Bluenotes the group led by Harold Melvin was still successful. My favourites include ""Bad Luck Pt l, Wake up Everybody Pt l"" and that ol' couples roller skating classic ""If You Don't Know me by Now"". Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes may not had as many hits nor lasted as long on the music scene as their contempories but the music was special and still endures. Rest in Peace, Harold."
2,Am I the only one who doesn't like Crocs?,"I got a pair for my daughter when she was 3 because all the kids had them. She loved them, and I did, too. They were so easy to put on, comfortable, and cute! The problem is, my daughter is extremely active. She runs everywhere, all the time. These shoes would fall off of her mid-flight, and she would fall flat on her face. Last summer when she was 4, I bought these thinking they may stay on better because of the back strap. I was wrong. These are worse. She ran, tripped, and landed flat on her face. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought they may be too big, so I put them away until this year (she is 5), and again, the first day she wore them, she runs, trips, falls on her face, and gets a fat lip, bloody nose, and a huge scratch on her beautiful face. I think she and I both learned our lesson, NO MORE CROCS!!!!!!"
4,Very Good,I bought the original GO and GO TOO brand new on LP Vinyl many years ago unfortunate couldn't find the Live in Paris version and the GO sesions on CD till now all in one and only if was digitally re mastered I would give it a 5/5 still a pretty good album 4 and a half out of 5 so if your into jazzrock fusion and like Aldi Meola's guitar playing as much as I do is worth buying recommended .
3,good movies for kids,I knew the movies I was getting and basically got this for just one of the movies. Three for the price of one is pretty good.
3,feels like normal towel material,"the robe wasn't as soft as i expected. feels like normal towel material. customer service was fine. i didn't get an email informing me that the product got shipped but when i inquired, i got a quick response."
5,Love Love this robe,This is a great bathrobe. I love it. It is very soft and long. It comes down to my ankle (I am 5'4). It is very warm and absorbent. Definitely for every penny.
2,Not nearly thick enough for a turkish robe,I was disappointed that this was not nearly thick enough. You would expect a much more robust product with such a description.
5,This robe is all I expected and more!,"Superplush, long enough and extremely well made, this robe is the best robe I've owned . I just washed the robe for the 1st time and it seems to have washed out well.So far, a very recommendable purchase for anyone wanting the best!"
5,SIZE INFO!,"Thanks to the reviews here (and the great sale price!) I've decided to order one for my husband.I simply went to the Turkish Towel website and here are the specs for this robe: (directly from the website)""The most important feature of Terry Bathrobe, is the thickness of its texture. This texture gives weight to the bathrobe and improves its ability to absorb water. This robe, which has the same texture with our Heavy & Soft towel collection is 650 grams per sqm and is available in 4 different colors. The product is one size fits most, while its total weight is 4 pounds.""""The Terry robe measures :Length 50 inchesSleeve Length 22 inches with a 8 inch hemShoulder 8 inchesArmhole circumference is 13 inches""Hope this helps! =)"
5,Extremely pleased,"This robe is very plush and absorbent. It is lovely. The color is more taupe than silversage, however. It runs larger than expected, but for use at the pool and spa, it is perfect."
5,Lite but strong .,Got this for my son for Xmas and he loves it for his new truck.. Has a real chrome look to it. Ball fits great and it fits in the tube nicely ...
5,Gripping,I could not put this book down. Ms. Griffin has written a chilling book intertwining facts of disturbing issues in our public school system with a fictional twist. I would recommend this book to anyone!
5,It really is Beatiful...,"Passionate stories told in poetry form, these tiny gems sparkle on the page. If you're familiar with Tea's other works, you'll see their origins here. Whether she's writing about advice for the lovelorn or life in Tucson and San Francisco, her strong voice comes through. Of course, if you're a reader with a prejudice against poetry maybe you shouldn't venture beyond Tea's prose. But if you have an open mind and love Tea's writing, don't miss this book!"
4,Sweet sound,Bought this for my four yr. old son who loves to play on my mom's pretend harp. He was born to make music no matter what the instrument or material. The wood is sturdy and it comes with a pick and song cards. He isn't in to those yet he just makes his own right now.The strings are sharper than on his quitar so he knows he must strum them softer. I would recommend this to those music lovers.
4,Dont miss the special features!,This was a pretty good movie. I think the lead actress did a good job in that role as she desends into madness from a happy newlywed to a possessed killer. What I liked most were a series of special features that do a documentary-style backstory on the history of the house. Creepier than the actual movie itself and adds an element of realism to the movie you just watched. Check out Lovely Molly and make sure you watch the special features after the film!
4,Confusing but not bad,"I've had to watch the movie twice & I still don't fully get what the hells goin on. Ok so we have Molly & Tim, a young newlywed couple. They move into Molly's parents house, apparently Molly's parents have been deceased for a while. At first I thought car accident may have taken them both or something to that effect, but it seems that the father may have met with foul play & we never really hear about what happened to Mom's. So at first I thought maybe the house was possessed by her father because he died in a violent way or something, but then you'll find out that Molly has a dark past & to me that changed everything. It's hard to figure if there really is a house haunting going on or if Molly is just plain nuts. Whatever the case, the actors did a good job & the chick that plays Molly doe's alot of runnin around naked so for me the movie was not bad. Worth a rental, see for yourself..."
1,MURDEROUS MOLLY,"I guess I'm just an old coot who loves a good horror movie, one that has a beginning, middle and end. A movie that has suspense and a few good scares. One that makes sense!!LOVELY MOLLY does not meet that criteria. Its muddled, incoherent and left me wondering exactly what was going on---and the ending was disastrous. I'm tired of so many writers these days asking me to fill in the blanks of their scripts. To each his own but I didn't enjoy LOVELY MOLLY."
1,This move is some straight up garbage!!!!!,Don't waste your time or your money. This movie is creepy but there is no climax to the film. It will leave you blue balled at the end!
4,Good Movie,I love movies that are based on true events. I did not like the ending so much because it left me a bit confused. But overall a good movie.
2,Too Sweet,"If you don't like really sweet things, don't buy this. It's really sweet. And it might've been because it's cold where I live, but the insides were more like mushy sugar than a pudding taste."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"These sounded interesting. When I received them, I was astounded in how many you actually get in one package.And the taste..light marshmallow with pudding inside. Just like it says. Very unique texture but that is what have sold me on these."
2,Disappointing presentation,"Being a stickler for spelling and grammar, I was distracted from the content of this book by the grammatical and spelling errors. The print quality was poor, with some pages very bold (to the point of being blurred) and others printed too close to the spine which made for difficult reading. The content may be sound, but I will never know as I haven't been able to get past the first chapter for those reasons."
2,Useless,The display on both the handset and phone died after 2 months of use. I think there are quality issues with this phone.
1,suspicious this product from this seller is repurposed,"I have been buying this clipper for eight years from Bed, Bath and Beyond. They stopped selling then at my store, and I am highly suspicious this product was a repurposed set.I will not be purchasing from seller again.I was forced to give one star, would have been zero."
3,Great trimmer terrible attachments,"The trimmer when considered independently is great. It is solid and does what it is supposed to do. The problems come when considering the attachments. They are poor quality plastic and break easily. Wahl tries to make up for this with excellent customer service. They mailed me new replacements with no questions asked. I'm not sure how this is a good long term business plan, covering over a poor product with great customer service. But that seems to be where they are. So, buy this trimmer, use it for defining lines, trimming the beard and keeping back of the neck clean. And as soon as your product arrives call Wahl customer service and ask for a new set of attachments, because the accessories which were shipped arrived and they are 'just about to break'."
4,Good gift,I bought this as a fathers day gift and it turned out great. I was skeptical at first but since it was a good quality name like Wahl i decided to get it. It looked & worked great when it was delivered. Good price and great shipping.
4,Good trimmer but needs more settings,"This is the fourth trimmer I've owned over the years (had a beard a long time!) and probably the best yet. Certainly is economical. My only gripe is that I'd like some setting just longer than stubble... The last trimmer I owned had a ""three day growth"" guard that was just perfect. Other than that, I like this unit a lot."
1,Transformer burnt out less than one month,"The transformer that charges the trimmer burnt out, and melted part of the housing in less than one month. Therefore I do not reccommend this product unless you like to throw your money away. Also, at my expense I mailed the burnt out transformer back to Wahl as they requested, and they sent a new one, which burnt out in two days. Therefore I have had TWO of the transformers for this unit burn out and melt. Since it only operates on power charged by a transformer, it is useless."
4,Work Horse,Tough little trimmer. I have a burly beard and this little work horse has been through it 4 times on a single charge with no signs of slowing down. My only complaint is that the guards are a pain to get on and off. I'd buy it again.
4,was well worth the price,"I shave my head with Mach 3 disposables. This is much more work, if you get lazy and let a month go by, so maybe then I go to the barber shop for about $12.00. If I kept up with it would cost me about $3.00 a week in disposables. At less than 20 bucks this thing has already paid for itself. I can go a month unshaven, and this shaver will bring me down to low stubble on head and face which I can easily finish off with a Mach 3 head. Wahl 9918-617 was well worth the price."
4,I LOVE IT.,Just what I wanted.Would recommend this item to others.I does the job that I bought it for. Thank you Wahl Groomsman Trimmer.
3,Storage is a problem,The storage base is not very user friendly. Company should send a diagram as to where all the attachments should be placed on it. Trimmer works well.
2,Ehhhhh,"Pros: Inexpensive...Cons: poor quality attachments, small size, noisyThis mustache trimmer is disappointing. I saw it got mixed reviews here on amazon, I should have leaned toward the negative ones. Everything in the photo is much smaller than it seems in the picture, that comb is a joke. This thing is tiny but its loud as hell. The shave is fairly close but the blade platform it self is so small I end up doing more work than I did with my bigger con-air trimmer. The cheap attachments are hard to put on AND take off.Its decent for the price, but I'm going to save my money and get a much better system and a more trusted brand. There are certain things you shouldn't be cheap with; Lesson learned."
5,AWESOME BANG FOR YOUR BUCK!,"For the cheap cost of this trimmer, you can't go wrong! I love it, the battery lasts long, it comes with tons of clips and the one adjustable 5 setting clip and it's a very nice package for it's price. Very comfy and a nice grip, I look forward to trimming now that I have this wonderful trimmer in my life. I really don't think you can go wrong with this purchase!P.S. I buy a lot of stuff at amazon.com and I NEVER review it, I suppose it's cause I think it's ""too out of the way"" to do, but I love this product so much that it was time to change that!"
4,Decent trimmer for the price,"This is a decent inexpensive trimmer. It does a fairly good job considering it is half the price of other trimmers. I have only used it a handful of times, so I cant comment on the durability. The only things that I have noticed are the storage pouch and the charger. My old trimmer (which lasted over 10 years) had a drop in charger. Although it is almost identical, this one has a cord that plugs in to the base. Just a minor detail. The travel pouch is junk. Very small and thin. It was in the package folded up and was not much bigger than a quarter. A zip lock bag will probably last longer than the pouch included."
5,I like so much,"Exelente produto eu recomendo a todos ,,perfect quality i recomend to us,,perfect,,great,good simple..exelente qualidade eu queria muito este produto e ele chegou perfeito em mos"
4,Wahl beard trimmer,works great; i accidentally broke the plastic beard length piece; could have been designed a little better; overall I am happy with it.
4,Good product,"Trimmer works great. The stand for the trimmer and its attachments is cheap plastic and looks cheap. Instruction sheet is decent, but leaves a lot to figure out by trial and error."
4,Very Good Beard Trimmer,"I bought this for my son. He is very satisfied. The only quibble is with the 6 level attachment. It is plastic and tricky to get securely attached to the unit. But once on, it is quite effective and useful."
4,Glad I bought this...,Was going to replace a rechargable battery on an old trimmer. Glad I got this instead. So far it seems to be a very good trimmer for the price. I do love the shape because it makes it very easy to hang on to and comfortable to use.
2,Not for a tough beard,"I happen to have a coarse, tough beard, which makes it very hard to find a sharp personal trimmer. I may just need to depend on the professional trimmers, which cost more. This trimmer was ok, but not sharp enough for my hair. In addition, the trimmer settings are quite a hassle to manage. I found the settings to be easier to manage with a panasonic or norelco. However, the performance on a Wahl is supposed to be better. My main annoyance is that I still have not found a sufficient sharp personal trimmer."
3,"Cuts well, but attachments are not easy to use","This trimmer works well, especially when fully charged and you don't need to work around the cord to use it.I had some troubles getting the attachments around the blades. The documentation was less than helpful in explaining how they worked. Ended up snapping off the side to the adjustable guard piece, rendering it virtually useless."
5,"Good Product, Great Value","I love it. I have had many mustache and beard trimmers, this one is by far the best one I have ever owned. The best part is the price. I have payed way more money for simular products that don't work or wouldn't last like the Wahl. This is a high quality product and you defenitely get what you pay for. I would recommend it to anybody, well at least men unless your a bearded woman."
2,Not as good as my Norelco,"I'm not impressed.I got this to replace my venerable Norelco T860. After 5 years or so of service, the Norelco conked out, and its only modern analog from Norelco, the T980 has a goofy vacuum feature that sounded like a gimmick to me. So I bought this Wahl.It takes way more passes over the same spot with the Wahl to get my beard to look even close to uniform length. And it still can't get the same uniformity as the Norelco T860 did. The Wahl is also narrower, so it's more passes over the same spot and more passes still to cover the whole beard, so it just takes a lot longer to use.Also, the adjustable length attachment on the Wahl doesn't lock in place very well, so it slipped a couple of times and left short spots.I gave up and bought the Norelco T980 with the goofy vacuum and ""turbo"" features. It is gimmicky as predicted, but it works a lot better than the Wahl for trimming my beard, so I can overlook all the silly business."
2,Awful attachments.. which you need,"Believe the negative reviews here that complain about the attachments. The trimmer itself works great, but if you're using it to maintain a beard you need the attachments (namely, the guides.) The reviewer that said his plastic guides broke after 3 uses is right on the money-- that's about all I got.The purpose of my visit to Amazon today is to replace this trimmer-- don't bother with this one."
3,mediocre attachments,The unit itself is sturdy and works great. It has a certain heft which makes it very comfortable. Unfortunately the attachments do not sit on it very well and have (for me) popped off a few times.
4,A *Wonderful* Book,"I also want to respond to that bitterly negative one-star review. I'd say that I've read *Rameau's Niece* six times at least, with undiminished enjoyment. It does appeal primarily to a narrow audience (it was recommended to me when I was in graduate school), but I resent the reviewer presuming to speak for everyone in roundly asserting that reading it is ""a waste of time."" Reading it has been some of the best time I've ever spent."
2,Pretentious,"Who is this person, Margaret, and why should I care about her problems? Because I could not answer these basic questions, I stopped reading on page 100. I simply could not relate to her or her life. She accidentally wrote a best selling book and she has the nerve to be whining!! But that's beside the point. I really wanted to enjoy this. I liked Schine's ""The Love Letter"" a lot. But this was sooooo pretentious. I stopped reading the inserts from the book-within-the-book after dragging my way through one or two boring, opaque selections. There were other parts of the book I didn't understand because they were about academics. Let those in the know enjoy. The rest of us would prefer to have the author help us out. Just for your information, I like complex books. Last year I read Anna Karinena (sorry about the spelling). It was wonderful, deep, complex but understandable."
1,A waste of time!,This book was chosen in our book group for the humor category....what a waste of time. Several members did not bother to finish it. The characters were not likable and we couldn't see a purpose for the story. We all agreed that this was probably the worst book we'd ever chosen/read in the 5+ years of our group. Don't bother!
5,Truth and Beauty,"I had the good fortune to see this book in the making when it was a thick sheaf of flimsy printer paper. The words and images collided in gorgeous ways, and I knew something special was taking form.I love what Robin Chapman and Clint Sprott have done. I love this book. More collaborations like this should be undertaken. It deepens our sensibilities. It enlarges our world. It does something graceful for the heart. The fractal images are beautifully rendered and Sprott's clear, concise definitions of key terms illuminate them for the lay reader. Chapman's poems are in perfect alignment with both the fractals and definitions, showing us ""life on the edge of change at every scale.""Here's a coffee table book that goes beyond decoration. Here's a book of poetry that goes beyond words. Here's science that makes itself accessible. I highly recommend this book to artists, scientists, and everyone else who wants to make the connections that help us explain our world and our lives."
3,"Decent book, if not up to her usual","Mary Higgins Clark's newest features her usual mix: an intelligent, sensitive heroine; a series of likable, realistic supporting characters, a sensitive, caring man that appears midway through the book, hinting at a possible happy ending. Ms. Clark, as always, writes very well, but the reason I rated this book as three stars was due to a very unlikely coincidence, and a glaringly obvious flaw in the plot. A good, unmemorable read, but far from her usual standard."
4,Before I say good-bye,"All I can say is that I hate Mary Higgins Clark because her writing talents makes me so jealous :-}Before I Say Good-Bye was one of the best of her books. But, as others have mentioned, you have to be a true fan to understand her writing style to enjoy her books.Her character were so clear. I fell in love with Nell, Gert and Mac. And the new love between Nell and Dan will be interesting. But I was left in the air about what may have happen to Winifred Johnson? Did Adam kill her? Did she escape from the boat? How did he lose the purse? How can you get that badly burned in a rubber suit? That was the only thing I wondered about.But it was still an incredible story. I had planned to read the whole book over the weekend. It didn't last two days in my hand. Oh well, back to my Javascript manual.Ms. Clark, I can't wait to read the next one."
1,Bombs,"This book was just terrible. Plot didn't amount to much. Extremely predictable. Shallow characters. Phoney introspection. Psychic focus a major bore. She has done far, far better."
3,A Not So Thrilling Thriller,"I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books, but this seemed almost slowmoving-not as suspenseful as the others. The plot seemed rather confusing to me. The doctor, Dan Minor,was one of the most interesting characters. I hope the next book follows her usual standards."
2,Was not impressed,"This book was not worth reading. I wouldn't recommend it. Although, it was well-written,it didn't leave a good and lasting impression because the villain in the novel was unbelievable."
4,A Page Turner!,"This is one of Clark's better novels--intriguing plot, great characters, and lots of twists. Beware--it's an addictive page turner; I was reading it on the bus and forgot to get off at my stop!"
3,"Fast Read, but loose plot","The further you get into the book the better it flows. You have trouble at first figuring out what she is trying to say in this book. She seems to go off on many tangents. It is not toward the last 1/2 of the book your figure out that Nell, the center character of the book, has to decide if she is going to accept psychic help to determine what happen to her husband. (Which happaens in the middle of the book). This would have been an extremmely written novel or short story if edited even more...."
3,"Not so much about the book, as about the READER!","I am frankly disgusted with Jan Maxwell's reading of this novel. Her reading is at best whiny and annoying rather than representing the strength of character that the various players in the story posess. I believe that Jan Maxwell also read another MHC novel that I heard recently and I came away with the feeling that the characters were all whiny and useless, basically just lucky to get themselves out of the scrapes they got into, rather than strong and decisive as I used to feel about MHC's characters when I simply read the books. It's definitely time to get a new reader."
3,Before I Say Good-Bye,"This is the third book that I've read by Mary Higgins Clark. At first it was confusing because she involves so many characters in her plot, but after the first 100 pages or so it's a good read. She adds a balanced combination of mystery and suspense, which keeps you reading. The one flaw I've seen in all of her books that I read is that she never develops new characters. She uses the same personalities in her writing just with a different plot. I find it annoying to have the same information constantly repeated."
1,too many characters,"I really hope that Mary Higgins Clark reads these reviews!I am a librarian, and hear many comments when patrons return their books.Many readers just plan gave up on this book because they couldn't keep the multitude of characters straight.I am a regular Mary Higgins Clark reader, so I stuck with it. However, I had to make myself a chart of the characters to use as a bookmark!There are, to the best of my count, 37 characters. I wondered why she even bothered to name some of them, as they did not advance the plot.I hope Mary reads this! She needs to know that if she is to retain her readership, she needs to meet the needs of the reader, and keeping track of so many characters is work, not leisure."
4,Lot's of common sense ...,"This book has a lot to offer any mom who feels guilt about not being the uber mom so many of us think we need to be. There's a wealth of good old fashion, just makes sense, practical advice for parents. I particularly enjoyed her discussions on sibling rivalry and family meetings. Definitely a useful read for moms and dads alike."
5,Good quality! Cute hat!,"When I was searching for Santa hats on Amazon, I was afraid I'd get a cheap costume type. Luckily, I decided to trust the single review posted, and voila, a really good quality and cute hat! It's very soft and plush. I'd definitely recommend. Great shipping service too."
5,Basic and excellent,"I think this is a great, basic pilates video. No equipment to purchase. Rael is very soothing to listen to. I think it is a good challenge."
5,this group made you feel like you were family,what voices these brothers have and the force to lay something on your mind. together with the genius of Gamble&huff they created timeless enjoyable and social aware music.i agree with the other reviewer about i love music but still hearing soul music like this is so good you can buy all there stuff and it sounds solid.
3,OK kit for the price but has one big problem,"All the tools in this kit are decent enough to do the job except one--the JAXA type case opener. Of the 12 bits that came with the kit, only 4 will actually fit in case opener tool (with no complete set/matching bits). The other bits appear to be just a hair too large to slip into any of the holders on the tool. In the situation of watch repair or battery replacement, this essentially makes the rest of the kit useless because you can't complete step 1: get the watch case open!"
4,book content,I found this to be a good book for those who shy from negotiation as they see it as always confrontational. Getting a better handle on the Kilmann styles and how to work with others in their preferred style while maintaining your own individuality was a key topic I found to be useful.
2,"Nice, but just not enough info","I bought this book in hopes of learning information about the presidents other than the simple things. It basically is full of greatly detailed pictures, but only has a small paragraph on each president. It's very small to beat that (the book itself). So, If you are looking to find trivia this book is not the right choice. Otherwise, if you want a brief summary of each president, this book is good."
3,Projector table,"It's a pretty decent inexpensive stand for a projector, if it is set where no one can bump it. When the legs are up to a higher height, it's not overly steady. It has little ""stop buttons,"" for lack of a better term, to adjust the height on each leg. One popped out shortly after I had the table, and I couldn't get it back it, nor can I take the time to ship the product back for replacement. I just have to stick a screw in that particular hole to support the table. As for being portable, it is that; the legs fit into the bottom of the table top."
5,Amazing book!,"Full of history and insight. Animation artists and fans of animation, do yourself a favor and get this! It's a great read and and a must have for any animation book collection."
2,If this book is so great...,"...then why is it out of print? I have been looking for this book for a long time. It only appears at used book stores or on ebay at high prices. If it is so great, why is it so hard to find?"
5,Great Book For Animators!,"Anyone who loves Disney animation and anyone who is learning the process of animation needs to get their hands on this book. It is long, it is detailed, but it is well worth it. This book mainly covers the essential Principles of Animation such as Squash and Stretch, Anticipation, Follow Through, etc. Go get it!"
5,best Disney book I know of,"This book is a masterpiece. I have several impressive Disney books of this style on my shelf, and this kills all of them.My version was printed in 1981. This means is has nothing later than ""The Rescuers,"" although I see from Amazon's site that there's a ""revised 1995"" edition floating around. I think that's merely a reprint, and does not substantially rework the text to include animated features released since 1981.It's huge, about the size of an unabridged dictionary. If you're looking to learn about cell animation and how the Disney animators got around several thorny problems, go no further. Also hundreds of incredible glossy pictures, including conceptual sketches, background paintings, line drawings, and a whole lot else."
2,Handy but comes with huge label that you can't get off,Right on the face of the rake is a big label that you can't peel off. It looks really crummy with the parts of the label on the rake. When will manufacturers learn that consumers hate that? When we stop buying things without removable labels!
4,Great for Camping!,"We camp a lot and I've bought several chairs in the past to use for sitting around the campfire. These are, by far really, the best! They are comfortable because of the firmness of the back support (unlike most 'bag' chairs where you slouch down in to them) and the side table is perfect for whatever you are eating or drinking. I actually bought two of them for two of my camping buddies for standing up in my wedding. A little more money but money well spent!"
3,Good Stand Paint Bad,I have had one of these stands for years to hold my Hagen Vision L12 Cage and it works great. I needed to purchase another one for another cage I have and when I got it the quality of it compared to the one I have had was not as great. But let me specify. The paint on it was bad. It had an overspray of white paint on many areas and I had to scrape it off. I was not thrilled about this for it took up some of my time. But overall the stand is a very good stand. I don't know if it was from purchasing it online where as the first one I had camr from the pet store. I need to purchase one more and hope that the one I get is better with the paint.
4,Can't wait to get it!,"Anna isn't all that exciting, so I gave it 4 stars. I would have given it 3 stars but: 1. I haven't read the book (All Pascal's books R good!) 2. Anna is going to start being more exsiting. (By what the back of the book says) I can't wait till I get the book, even though Anna can be boring. (Ex. Since her brother died she's been kinda mopy) I hope Anna gets good at acting. She seems like she'd be good at it! When I get the book I'll put up another review."
4,Digital Phone,"Small, Compact...with lot's of bells and whistles...literally...you can change the ring tone based on caller ID. A solid choice for a 5.8ghz phone...with similar features found in most cell phones. Perhaps even too many features for the casual user. Works well...and would recommend."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I bought this phone after reading the glowing reviews, selecting it rather than the 2.4 ghz 2631 model, although I didn't really understand the difference. Despite what many people seem to think (""bigger is better""), the only significant difference with a 5.8 ghz unit is it will not interfere with other wireless devices in the home/office.The sound quality of this telephone is not so good as the reviews indicate. The highest volume is still quite low (the same criticism as I read about the 2.4 ghz model). Quality of out-going message is very bad - sounds terrible to the people who call you.After one day, I have decided to return this thing and will not bother with Panasonic phones again.I am going to buy another Uniden TRU-8885. I have this at home for two years now and it is marvelous! Clear, loud, expandable and less expensive, too. Why didn't I buy this in the first place? Target had the Panasonic on sale, that's why."
3,Great phone but short-lived,"Did everything promised, and did it well - for about ten weeks of use. Then the base station quit. The phone is still fine, but without the base station it's paralyzed.I haven't time for this sort of nonsense so I'll replace it with something cheap from a local store.Great phone (5), didn't live long (1), so it gets a compromise rating of 3 stars."
3,An excelent history of magic,"This is an excelent book written in the early 1900's. It discusses many different utility devices and apparatus used at that time, most of which are still in use today. It is one of three books in a series written by professor Hoffman. The other two books are Modern Magic and More Magic."
2,Squeaky,The shoes are very comfortable and the price was great but the shoes squeak whn i walked. the left one started first then both squeaked. it was embarrasing to walk down the hall. i guess it was the rubber soles had somethine inside them that moved around or something. i wouldnt buy these again.
3,As long as its subject,"""Empire Express"" is a very informative account that unfortunately gets bogged down with too much detail. Author Bain just doesn't have the touch of a David McCollough (""The Path Between the Seas"") to make his lengthy narrative consistantly interesting. Still, there is plenty of good information and the fourteen years Bain spent researching and writing this book is a testament to what a labor of love it was for him. Overall, serious history buffs will probably find the most enjoyment but the average reader is likely to become bored with it."
5,Excellent,"As a California historian and old surveyor myself(PLS 3045), I can attest to Mr. Bain's accuracy from both aspects. I almost felt I was running my own transit line through the mountains, setting the grade and swinging the instrument around to intersect the cross-hairs with the hillside and signalling the rodman to set the stake. A superb recounting. I felt I stood right behind ""Crazy Ted"" all the way.Ray Peters"
1,"Great Topic, Poorly Written","I was very excited about this book until I tried to read it. There is a wealth of history embodied in these pages, but it is painful trying to sift through the monotonously pedestrian and sophomoric prose. This book reads like a poorly written high school term paper."
5,Great circular saw from great company,"This saw was recommended by This Old House. Their first choice was the Milwaukee, but they recommended this Makita for those who want a lighter saw. This saw weighs 7 lbs. vs. 10 lbs. + for the Milwaukee. Also it is a shade narrower. If you are a framing carpenter you might want the extra power of the Milwaukee. But you will be sorry when you have to use it over your head. For woodworkers, handy men, trim carpenters, etc., the Makita is the one to pick. And now, the price: HALF the price of the Milwaukee!"
3,"ok movie, but worth waiting till video","Fun movie, but not really worth seeing in the theatres. Mac Caulkin was very funny though, and so was his counterpart. They made a great couple and made it a good movie for me. Save your bucks for the DVD though."
4,Fun to watch and hopefully edifying too.,"It's not great but it has good intentions. It starts as satire, seeming to mock modern hypocrites who call themselves Christians, but it's not an anti-Christian film.In the end it gets preachy. But that's okay with me. It's preaching the true message of Jesus, the one you seldom hear today. It's the message of tolerance that early Christians must have put forth, before the Romans highjacked Christianity as a useful tool for controlling their empire.What a shame more churches today don't preach the message that this little teenage comedy attempts to share.I give it four stars for effort."
5,Great movie,"This has to be the best movie on religion ever. I think it really sums up the fact that most of the Religious groups and school are wrong in the way they go about things. It brings out the fact of them not giving the children the education they need to be these so called ""Christians."" Great acting and comedy threw the whole movie. Over all it shows us the reality of our religious state today! and makes you laugh. gotta love it!"
4,Hilarious,"I saw this movie recently on TV and thought, I must buy this one. It is hilarious! I love satires, because they are just too true; and this movie is no exception. I enjoyed laughing at myself (since I was fundamentalist several years ago and used to act very much like Mandy Moore's character.) Everything bad that happened in life...""we must pray."" Ah, such bittersweet memories I have left behind...thankfully! I certainly would not call this movie an endorsement of Christianity, but that is the beauty of it. It's an in-your-face movie, so don't watch it if you're a fundie with no sense of humor."
1,Alot of people must think teenagers are really stupid,"I see so many good reviews for this, and all I can say is, were all of you payed to give this movie great marks? This not only stereotypes Christians, but teens too! It basically says that 'normal' teens can't make their own decisions, take drugs, get pregnant, and drink in bars without giving a care for anybody else. Um, hello, teens are people too! This film acts like those who drink and take drugs are smarter than college kids and their future will surely be wonderful. Why wait to have sex when you can just get rid of the kid is the message this movie sends out to viewers. A bunch of trash as far as I'm concerned."
1,Saved - for the dumpster,"I love how political correctness dictates that it is wrong to make fun of certain lifestyles, skin color, etc., but the Christian faith is fair game. This movie is tasteless, horrid and something typical that those who protect evil in Hollywood are cooking up these days. 'Save' yourself some trouble and go buy a copy of Passion of the Christ.If there was a movie out there poking fun at a Muslim school, the you-know-what would hit the fan dead on in how mean spirited and offensive it would be. If you think this movie is funny, you need to look in your own soul. Probably a one way ticket to a very unpleasant place in your future."
5,What a great movie!,"I just saw this last night and I have to say this is one of the funniest movies I'd ever seen. I'm a conservative Christian and found this movie HILLARIOUS!!! I secretly make fun of those who get crazy at a Christian rock concert or wear t-shirts that say ""Jesus is Alright By Me"". If you're like me, you'll love this movie."
3,"Messy, preachy","I have no problem with the fact that Saved pokes fun at Evangelicalism (or is it Fundamentalism?), but this film is messy and uneven. Even worse, the ending is a bit preachy. This is basically a message movie (always a bad thing) meant to teach us a lesson about tolerance and diversity. It's a nice message, but I felt like I was a grade-schooler watching Free to Be You and Me all over again.Muscially, I don't like the way Mandy Moore belts out the chorus to my favorite Beach Boys' tune, and I remain completely puzzled by The Replacements' tunes at the prom."
1,God awful,"In its first 15 minutes, ""Saved!"" is acerbically funny, with a ""South Park"" level of irreverence and audacity. Then it all goes to hell. The film devolves -- no -- disintegrates into a treacly morass of teen-movie cliches, some so syrupy sweet that you need a shot of insulin just to get through them. Though the language is not suitable for anyone below the age of 13, the plot is not worthy of anyone over the age of 12. The filmmakers completely sold out. Buy ""Donnie Darko"" instead."
1,I cant stop Laughing,At first I did not believe this movie was funny till I started (Laughing) reading the reviews (Laughing) I wish I had a dollar for every time some one said this is not a anti-Christian movie (laughing) I would be the richest man in the world (still Laughing)
3,"Close, so Close.","Having been expelled from public school back in the 80's, I ended up at an evangelical school not unlike the one featured in this film (is it any wonder that I'm an Atheist?). So, needless to say, I got a kick out of the Principal who tries to rap, and speak slang ""for da Lord."" The film is pretty effective with poking fun at self-righteous hypocrites, but it was too tame, in my book.The ending turned out to be (don't worry this isn't exactly a SPOILER) your typical Hollywood, feel good, respect differences, blablabla ending. What a shame! The humor was cutting up till the end. It would've been sweeter with some blood + guts, or a big shoot 'em out.Oh, well, at least it was entertaining."
5,Well Said,"This is a good little movie about what it really means to be Christian. I enjoy it because it sends out the message that we are not all perfect, but God loves us just the way we are. It also shows how people can easily misunderstand God's word."
2,Does it work??,I have tried several batteries new and rechargeable and still I can not get this to work. I will keep trying because the magnet strength is amazing and it's perfect for my popup.
2,Good quality but too heavy,"It works fine, quality is good, but I would go with another option ( less heavy). This is not LED so not so bright! and too heavy for tent use."
5,Great little light,This is a must have for your camping tent. So convenient to use and doesn't get in the way in tight quarters.
2,The Lighting is not that good,"This Tent light is nicely designed, cleverly put together, but has very poor lighting. you almost have to sit right under it to see anything. needs a better bulb."
4,Great light for anywhere!,"This light is bright, can be attached to either a metal RV wall surface or through a tent wall using the strong magnet on the back, and can be detached easily and be used as a hand-held flashlight. The batteries last forever, and I never needed more than just one of these babies to light up my entire tent or tent trailer!I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it's heavy, and if your tent walls aren't tight enough it can cause it to sag... but even that's an easy fix, just don't attach the light to the wall (it works just as well sitting on the ground)!"
3,Not bad,"This light is fine, but heavy. When you hang it in the tent, it weighs it down. If it were to rain, you would probably have a leak. We actually use it in our camping kitchen and our camping grill. I can't recommend you use it with a grill because it isn't designed for that kind of heat- so be careful. But it's great with the camping kitchen!"
5,Like it a lot,"I like these lights quite a bit. We do not hang them in the middle of the tent, though, so I can't attest to it lighting up a whole tent (plus our tent is big, 15x12). We use these right above where we sleep in the tent for reading, etc. They hold well and don't pull on the tent too much. We use rechargeable batteries in them, too, so I don't know how fast they go through regular batteries, and each takes 4 AA, so rechargeables would be a good idea. And yes, the lights are an oval shape, just as an FYI. They have a rubberized push button on/off on the side and the batteries are easy to put in and take out."
3,Didn't work,01/23/2013: I received my product very fast but after installing the batteries the product was useless. I even tried a new batteries set and yet didn't work. I am not going to give up and going to get a replacement and see what happens.01/26/2013: Received the second one and after installing the new batteries it worked as expected. so far no complaint but I haven't used it in the field. will update later
3,It's okay,"This was part of a package deal to go with the tent I purchased, it's okay but would have never bought it if it was not part of the package."
3,there are better lights out there.,This would work better in a cabin or adirondak where there is something to mount it to.Maybe in a shed or garage. Not a tent.
2,Iffy,"The picks don't stay in very well. I don't even trust my pics in it at home, much less if I was jumping around a stage. Get some duct tape or something."
1,Ugh,"What a terrible CD. I'm truly fortunate that I stumbled across this on the Internet, because that means nobody I know listens to it."
4,Really fun!,"The characterizations are spot on, the plot is a bit thin. This book is still very entertaining. I highly recommend the Cutting Audio full cast audio books!! Especially if you are a Stony Man fan."
4,worth buying and wearing out,"AnthologyThe AppalachiansDualtone Records 80302-01201-2Dualtone.comVery Ken Burns. Faded sepia still photos come to mind, as do talking heads speaking from paneled, book-lined offices at the University of Tennessee. This is not a bad thing. Ken Burns has lured a lot of people into appreciation of and interest in the Civil War, baseball and other documentary topics. That this anthology is a companion piece to a public television series is better than okay -- it wouldn't have existed without it.Affiliation with a themed broadcast series also kept producers' goals of sharing and educating in the forefront of decisions about what to include. The record never loses sight of Scotch-Irish musical roots, nor of the lyrical topics one would expect from ignorance and poverty, societal factors that do exist alongside us, just out of range of the CD player remote control.It is a successful documentary, and easily worth buying and wearing out."
1,Don't buy!,"A nice theory, but it doesn't work. The paper wrap is impossible to light. You need to start a fire in the normal way, and then hope this log catches on fire. Absolutely ridiculous! Buy Duraflame."
1,Do not buy this product - it's a total SCAM!,"Here's the thing. I'm sitting in my house trying to deal with an acrid waxy, plastic burning smell that refuses to go away. The first log I lit from this batch only flickered for a half hour, then went out and smouldered for the rest of the night. When I had to kill this thing before it choked my entire family to death with its toxic fumes, all this junk came out of it -- colored waxy catalogues, shredded milk cartons, Sunday newspapers circulars, all the stuff you would never in a million years put in your fireplace. Enviro-log? What a joke -- this is a scam in which they're taking useless landfill and making your fireplace a dump. Stick with Duraflame!!"
2,NOT HAPPY!,"Instead of 3 hours it burns 1.5 or max two hours. While burning it is falling apart which is not safe, glowing pieces are rolling to the edge of hearth...The fire itself is so-so. Price wise it wa a little cheaper than duraflame but it was not worth it."
4,Bayou Fitness Pair of Adjustable Dumbbells - 25 LB.,"4 Stars: they look great, once I read the illustrations on the weight base it is easy to figure out how many individual weight plates need to be on each side of the bar. Play with the adjustment bolt to get a feel for how the bolt slides back and forth and to get a feel for how to pick up/pull the dumb bell up and out of the cradle/base that it sits on. It's not rocket science but once I did get a feel for it I now use this set with my P90 workout 6 days a week."
4,CR Bayou Review,"These are well made weights, easy to change, price is reasonable and the company does an excellent job in shipping product in a timely manner. Received within 3 days customer satisfaction Excellent ."
5,artfully and realistically written,"a very well-written and interesting book. a bit sad of course, but also greatly insightful. except for the issues of romance and relationships, it also deals with depression. i found it mirrored many issues from modern day life and was thuswise actually wise.i also learned a lot of things about the complex and genious personality of this philosopher, which i found really interesting. i'm glad i bought this book, i intend to read it again sometime, it deals with so many many issues."
1,thermasilk review,"I purchased thermasilk shampoo on line from amazon.com.The product bottle looks the same but the product inside is different from my original thermasilk shampoo. The original I previously had was a milky white color and worked great. My newly purchased product is a transparent goldish color and is no better than any cheap product on the market now. It leaves my hair very dry. I wouldn't mind a product not working, but $8.00 for the shampoo and $6.00 for shipping is unexceptable for a product which I am highly dissatisfied with. Pete"
4,Excellent starter on Islamic History,"""Timely book with all the protests going on. Based on this book, the more that changes, the more that stays the same. What is going on right now appears to have been going on since the Roman times. While the Moghul Empire, the Ottomon Empire and all other States, there have always been local kings, caliphates and others with changing alliances. The heart of Islam has gone from Baghdad to Damascus to other locations fluidly. Easy read, a starter to give a good glimpse."""
2,Really!?,"When albums like this get 4 stars, it makes me question the entire universe of Amazon reviews. If I understand the other reviews correctly, if you don't like this, you must be some sort of obsessive ""purist"". I guess a ""purist"" is anyone who values creative songwriting and inspired playing.Maybe I'm handicapped by having bought this when it was first released, years ago. I could hardly listen to it, it was so bad. Perhaps in the context of today's degraded musical standards, it's become better with age. So I'll give it 2*."
2,Why should we care?,"This was an amusing little slip of a book, but in the end, I really couldn't help but be really put off by Daisey's attitude and funny descending into smarmy writing style. He has some good fun at Amazon's expense and okay, who doesn't often have revenge fantasies about their place of employment, but after page after mind-numbing page of Daisey's attempts at self-deprecation (through which he only comes across as lazy and stupid) you'll be glad when you reach the end. And it just ends. For someone who can be, at times, expansive and philosophical there is nothing in the way of an ending to wrap things up effectively.If what he says is true, my appreciation goes out to those who went through the experiences Daisey describes. However, I don't see how it can't be taken with a grain of salt. More power to him, though. Amazon is selling his book."
2,WOW,"This movie is incerdible!!! It is typical ""over the top"" foriegn action film movie with other stories going on at the same time. You will not tire from watching this."
3,Alio Mundo Oz,"Fun for a Latin reader - the latin is ""American"" in its style, not Ciceronian by any means. I had never read Baum's original, but saw this in the library and decided to both practice my Latin and see how different the original story is from the famous movie. Copies are hard to find, but it's recommended."
3,cool book,I have not started it yet I thumd though it and it is great for elementry school girls that what speacle time with God and a time to feel speacle
5,Rabbit Hunting by Dave Fisher,"This book is a must for anyone with hunting beagles, or who is considering one. The authur is an expert, and to read his book sure beats learning by the school of hard knocks! And the reading is fun, with lots of great stories."
3,Good first effort!,"I really liked Jasmine Trias on American Idol so I made sure I bought her CD. I like it and think it's a good first effort, however, it reminds me too much of Jennifer Lopez. Jasmine's voice is much better!I hope as she matures that she can define her own style and not let others have her ""copycat"" someone else's."
2,Disappointed,I was so disappointed in Theresa Sokyrka's First Album these old charms. I was looking forward in her audition song Gob Bless the Child and purchased this CD just to hear her sing like she sang it in her audition. What a let down. Theresa decided to play it safe on this CD and did not let loose. No emotions. Just another voice and bland at that.
3,A Writer's Resource,The product came pretty quickly but the packaging wasn't very good and the corners of the book were bent. I would recommend that they put some cardboard or something a little sturdier in the packaging when they ship it.
4,Great read,"Night Criesby Barbara SteinerReviewer: Pamela Ackerson, author of Home of the Braves trilogyA suspense chock full of drama for the young adult. A quick read and good story wrapped into an excellent page turner. In a way it reminded me of the movie Ten Little Indians and even mentions it in the book. But it is it's own story and worth every moment you spend reading it. Enjoy."
2,No thanks,"This watch actually looks silver when viewed online, but when I received it I saw that it was in fact a transparent watch. A clear band with silver flecks in it. Just not my style. Although it looked to be a pretty durable watch, I ended up returning it."
3,I feel like a shaman wearing it but that's ok.,"Yeah it's a little ornate and foofy but I still like it. It's well-made, light, and the colors are brilliant."
3,NOT for beginners,"In the Preface of the book it states:""Whom This Book Is ForThis book is for anyone who needs to learn abut Windows programming. If you're new to Visual C++, or even new to Windows programming, you can learn the basics and master Windows programming fundamentals in no time.""The above statement is part of the reason I bought the book. I had never even looked at C++ code prior to buying the book and it is not what I need as a beginner.Please don't state this book is for beginners when it is not. I'm not saying that this book won't be useful for me in the future, but for now I need to go out and buy another book on learning Visual C++."
1,The worst book I ever read,"The introduction offered by authors makes it a seemingly nice book.But after I opened it, I regretted on my puchase immediately.They wanted to tell you everything about VC++, but they didn't know where to start, what to start and how to start. Even worse, they never provided an example from the very beginning step. They assumed the readers are a group of experts-to-be, who only owe a bunch of shredded ""advices"" from this ""Bible"".In my opinion, this book is a junk both to beginner, intermediate, and experts.Authors performed like a bear in the corn field, hoping to get everthing there, but made nothing at last.If possible, I will give it 0 star.Think it carefully before you buy this book."
4,budget compilation worth the investment,"This Sony Special Products compiliation combines some of Andy's greatest hits with other album cuts in a nice mix of Columbia Records material. For someone new to Andy's music, this is a good introduction. For any long-time Andy admirer, this compilation captures some of Andy's finer studio recordings."
2,Poor structural design,"A small 5 year old child leaned up against this and it broke at the neck. The casting of some cheap material, and has such a small cross section, it has no strength. Now I have to replace them all with a different design, or buy another one of these. I would guess all the designs from this manufacturer use the same weak material. Looks pretty, that's why I gave two stars, but if can't withstand any stress, then it's basically more chinese garbage."
2,Know your limits...,"Now, I'm a BIG fan of Belle & Sebastian, and one thing I appreciate about them is their experimentation -- that is, the way they recombine their influences rather than simply wearing them on their sleeves. Unfortunately, this e.p. does the latter. The middle-track, an instrumental, and the best one on the e.p., is bookended by complete throw-away attempts at el records razzle-dazzle circa '86 & The Cyrcle (see ""Red Rubber Ball"") circa '66. ""Judy Is a Dick Slap"" (brilliant title), however, is worth it to me: an updated take on Felt's middle-era instrumentals played with a moog which they somehow make orchestral in the best, most expansive sense of the word. Belle & Sebastian are very unsteady, have yet to learn their limits, but still (on occassion) make my day."
3,Massive talent and yet...,"I can't but agree with the other reviewer. I knew these guys from England in the early 70s. True, they go everywhere (""discontinuity"") but here and there (for instance, ""Isadora"", ""Bathers""--the latter is ..well, almost more pop but what depth in this voice and the theme itself is esoteric--who knows of Lake Balathon), they really display impressive stuff. So, three stars is correct, unfortunately. Yet, I never gave up this album and ""Snafu"" which I bought 30-35 years ago as a kid (or so) and That may say something..."
2,Keyboard is unusable,"This keyboard can't be used as a regular keyboard. There's no SHIFT key on the right side. If you want to shift for caps or characters, you can ONLY use the shift key on the left side. I've never seen this before. I can't even imagine a serious keyboard with no right SHIFT key. I was not able to use this keyboard at all. My little finger kept going for that shift key, and there isn't one.Furthermore, it's REALLY small. Could it be intended for use with a cell phone? It's far smaller than the keyboard on my laptop. It's so lightweight, it won't hold still while I type, it moves around on the keyboard shelf.There are no legs under the top of the keyboard so it can't be raised up for ease of typing.It's a beautiful little keyboard, and appears to be very well made. But for me, at least, it's completely unusable. I returned it for a refund."
5,Great mini-keyboard,I was amazed at how small this is. I use it to take with me when doing PC repairs. The fact that it's wired means I don't have to deal with wireless when a system doesn't even have an OS installed in it.
4,A nice potboiler with an alternative lifstyle,"Like another of your reviewers, I am a heterosexual male who at first was turned off by the graphic male on male fantasies and the more graphic sex. But unlike your other reviewer, it didn't make me homophobic. Instead it was simply an interesting angle in a decent whodunit in which the who was a little too evident.On second thought, why not male on male fantasies. Most books of this genre have male on female or (more recently) female on male. It's what makes this book a little different."
2,Not for the non-fish lover,"I must clarify. I am not a big lover of fish in the first place, so I am biased. But I come away from this book wanting a lot more (more information about the fish wars, about how the moratorium is working, why the moratorium in Scandinavian water is working) and less information (recipes).I know, I am rating down what most people love this book for. But I wanted a more historical take then this book provided. If you are looking for lively reading and interesting cod recipes and a brief pre-cursor on Cod Fishing, then this is a your book. If you would like something more in depth, then this is not it."
5,Cod,"This bio on codfish has changed how I look at what's on my plate. An amazing story, brilliantly told, with a lesson for the entire human race."
4,cod: a well written history,"Cod is an engaging history of the fish that changed the world. As an eye opening adventure, cod takes the reader from low impact commercial fishing of ancient Europe to the destructive power of modern fisheries. Mark Kurlansky shows his creativity and skill as he brings to focus the plight of cod. The author further illustrates the ability of super consumers to deplete a previously perceived inexhaustible cod population. In this biography is shown the effect cod fishing has had on individual lives, nations and the world. The book keeps the reader thirsting for more. The main weakness of this book would be the abrupt ending to the enchanting tale. Cod is for historians and scientists alike. Fishermen and those that enjoy sea food will appreciate this book. Cod is a book that should be read and reread by everyone as a reminder of mankind's dependence upon and responsibility to conserve earth's diminishing supply of natural resources."
1,A BIRTHDAY GIFT DISASTER!!!,"I should have bought a $39.99 set at a local store. But I wanted to give my husband a super birthday gift. IT WAS A DISASTER. His pole broke on our first game! The paint on the balls came off too! I felt like if I had bought a 2nd hand item. No quality control or true warranty from manufacturer (Dewey USA) who to my surprise was quite nasty about giving me a refund. Upon returning set, I had to pay all shipping costs. I lost $75.00, made a lowsy gift and made a fool of myself. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!"
1,You don't interupt art !!!,"What can I say. If you like appetizers with with no main course this is the disc for you. This disc at first glance looks to be the motherlode that many jazz fans have been searching for on DVD. The lineups are spectacular. The filming and sound is pretty much excellent throughout. So what's wrong? These are ticklers. They are basically 4 minute segments from other TDK filmed concerts. They end uncerimoniously in mid solo, with a few exceptions (McCoy Tyner manges to complete Naima in the required time limit). I find it very upsetting to fade out in the middle of a Joe Henderson solo. This is the rule not the exception. So what is a jazz fan to do? Just try to find the concert films on line !! You will only find the total collection at Amazon UK for very hefty prices. If the material were accessible at reasonable prices I would applaude this disc. As it is I found it upsetting, to say the least."
1,not jazz,"I totally agree with 'hylmunchkin'. This can't be called jazz. This is just a smooth music or soft music. I love jazz and for me jazz died after 1980. This cd I wouldn't reccomend for jazz fans. If you are into smooth jazz, then i would recomend Paul Desmond."
1,Jazz??? Not!,"I see people calling this tripe jazz. This is NOT jazz, its muzak without the variety. This stuff numbs the mind. Kenny G. is the Thomas Kinkaid of music, a McDonalds and K-Mart class of elevator music. The only high point in the entire dismal assault is ""One More Time"" with Chante Moore. Kenny G. should be remanded to playing backup for her. Kenny G. is a way-overrated studio musician. And who ever called that fagpipe a saxophone? What a dud."
3,A BONEY JAMES RIP - OFF ..........,"KENNY G IS BACK WITH A BRAND NEW ALBUM, BUT HE SOUNDSA LITTLE DIFFERENT. AMAZINGLY, HE HAS TRIED TO MAKEHIMSELF SOUND LIKE BONEY JAMES !!!OBVIOUSLY HE COULD NEVER ACTUALLY QUITE MANAGE TO DOTHIS, AS BONEY IS THE TRUE MASTER OF SMOOTH JAZZ,BUT HE HAS CERTAINLY TRIED.TRACKS LIKE ""BRAZIL"", ""SEASIDE JAM"" AND ESPECIALLY""MALIBU DREAMS"" SOUND SIMILAR TO BONEY'S STYLE OFPLAYING, BUT THEY END UP SOUNDING MORE SICKLY SMOOTH THANSEXY SMOOTH.THEN AGAIN, IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN MOST OF KENNY G'SPREVIOUS OFFERINGS.A GOOD EFFORT, BUT BONEY IS STILL THE BEST !!!"
4,solid album,"This is not an album i was particularly looking forward to or anything. Ibought it because i read it had been released so i decided to get myself a copy. Money well spent let me tell you. Joacim can really sing always awesome and always on. The main thing that will strike you about this album is that it is most definetly not Hammerfall which is both good and bad. Its bad because most peopel have a very clear musical path in mind when they think of Joacim's voice. Its awesome because the different musical contribitors to this album such as Mike Chlasciak, Steven Elmgren, Mat Sinner and Tom Nauman all leave they're marks on this album. if you're a fan of any of those guys bands including Hammerfall go get this. Joacim Cans does not disapoint."
1,"Not only horribly biased but - where's the ""weird"" stuff?","I just finished this book and was signing on to express my opinion but then I noticed that Bill Brewer here has expressed my feelings quite nicely already. I whole-heartedly agree with his post and also give the book one star.Also, it's not really about weird history- just some different perspectives (or, more often, rehashed revisionism) of pretty well-known historical events."
2,Don't Bother,"Loved the concept, but did not work as expected. Too stiff to work well. I will stick with my electric mixer."
1,Table Mate folding tables - new ones are disappointing,"I recently ordered 3 Table Mate tables. I have three that I bought quite a few years ago and I really like them. They're sturdy and don't tip or collapse. However the white trays have gotten quite stained so I decided to get new ones. I am really disappointed by the fact that these are flimsy and it doesn't take much to accidentally tip them --- the materials are not as good or as thick, and the brace that holds the tray to the legs is skinnier and slips out of place with little movement, thus creating a collapsing problem --- a big one if food or drink is on it! Also the size of the trays is notably smaller and thinner than the old ones. I have now reverted back to using my old ones -- they may not be as ""pretty"", but I don't have to worry about them collapsing. By the way, the new ones I'm writing about were 2 white tray tables and 1 woodgrain tray table."
3,Barely Ample,"The product worked fantastic for the first week or so. I kept a fairly light laptop on it, and, as has been the case with others who've tried the product, the table eventually developed a horizontal dip/sag in the middle. Aside from that and how cheap the top of the product looks, the rest of it is well constructed and works as it should. It'd be a great buy for 15 bucks, but not 25."
3,"Good for the money, I guess","This ""table"" was easy to put together - but, as other reviewers noted, it is not very steady. There is no way I would put 50 lbs on it. Perhaps 20. It is a good size as a TV tray and to put my laptop on, but wish it was a bit larger for adding paper or a mug at the same time. It has stayed up and is being used but I'm not thrilled with it. Hope I can find something sturdier and nicer looking soon."
4,just as i expected,was looking for a table that could be used occasionally and put away nicely when not needed. the table-mate fit the bill
4,Computer tray,I bought this to hold my laptop in or outside and it works great. Doesn't matter the chair height since it's totally adjustable. Well worth the price.
4,Most useful furniture after my recliner.,"I use mine at my recliner. On the side when watching TV and in front when eating.I don't know why I waited so long to buy this.At $30, it makes a nice gift for others."
3,"Flimsy table, but it will do the job","I was hoping this table would have been a little sturdier. It is very light weight, but the legs seems slightly bent wrong and a put 5 small paperback books on it and it had an appreciable sag. I will be using this to work on my light laptop, I wouldn't put much else on there."
2,warps immediatly,I received this less than 3 weeks ago and it already warping. Good idea but bad design. I will modify the table with real wood so it actually works.
1,This is not a TABLE MATE 2!!!!,"I just got this in the mail and it is not a table mate 2! the logo is nowhere on the table and the material is very very cheap. When I opened the box a chunk of the plastic on the table was broken off. After that I noticed that one of the legs wouldn't fit into the hole, it was bent! Then finally the side of the plastic on the tray was scraped up like it had fallen off something onto concrete. This is a piece of crap and I am sending it back right away and buying a real table mate off the ""table mate"" website."
4,Functional,"This table is functional and works as described. There is a cup-holder on this model, more of a gimmick than of use but fun to have anyway. Incredible easy to assemble right out of the box.The ""woodgrain"" table top, however, is brown plastic. Not really resembling wood at all. The edges are slightly raised, so things placed on the tray won't roll or slide off. The tray top is bigger than the old TV tray it was replacing.Overall, a good value that ships well and is sturdy. Recommend for functionality, but not necessarily for looks!"
2,No Instructions,Came with no instructions on how to put together. Did not have any information on the table in the box.
3,Not so helpful,"I am looking for a table that is not too big or heavy. I love arts and crafts and watching television at the same time, so I need to find a table that I am able to take a table where ever I want to go. I am also on a wheelchair, so finding a table that I am able to fit under can also be challenging for me. What to do, what to do. :("
1,poor quality vs advertised picture,Do not recommend purchasing this product. i have purchased may items from Amazon and this is the first piece of junk that i had to return. Not recommended for purchase unless you get it at a garage sale for 10 cents!Table-Mate II Woodgrain Folding Table
5,Very useful,"So far I love this table - its exactly what I wanted. It's light, thus easy to move where I need it, but sturdy enough to hold a meal or a pile of newspapers which is what we use it for, and its legs tuck in nicely under the sofa. It's not beautiful but not too ugly because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than utilitarian. I had a little trouble putting it together - for some reason the table was at an angle rather than level when I had finished, but when I gave up, my husband who is not particularly handy, figured it out and fixed the problem very quickly."
5,Much more intricate,"Rod is the star on this one. It seems like Ty brought the drums up alot in the mix because Rod was out of his mind with his playing on this record. I feel that the songs have better hooks than the first Jelly Jam and the production is better as well. Great album. If you're a Dream Theater or King's X vertical collector, put this one in the pile. Solid."
3,Disappointed,"I was VERY disappointed that this CD did not have my favorite Martina song, ""Cry on the Shoulder of the Road,"" from WILD ANGELS. In fact, I want to sell my copy and buy WILD ANGELS."
5,its just great... i mean... MOLDY!!!!,"i was listening to my super duper awsome mix cd one day, and then i thought, ""hmmm, moldy peaches, didnt sombody say that the other day? hmmm.."" so then i went online and started searching for song songs. the first one i heard was these burgers. i was eating a burger at the time and then i listend to what they were saying. i started to laugh. after that, i got what went wrong, i said ""I DONT KNOW! AHHHHHH!!!"" only after a short 6 months of searching and downloading i finally got the whole cd, AND ITS CERTINLY NOT MOLDY! ITS BETTER!. get this cd... even if it means paying money."
4,Buy a $5 thin board for a table top,"After reading the reviews about the stove falling through, I bought anyway but I ran out to the local hardware store and bought a sheet of cheapo compressed board for $5. Cut it to match the stand with a little overhang and then I cut it in half, re-taped with duct tape (so now it folds in half). It fits fine in with the stove itself in the Coleman stove leather bag. Used it this last weekend and it worked great, extended to max, shoved a few stakes in the feet and put the board on top and the stove right on that. Was super sturdy and no possible way for the stove would fall.They should include something similar with this, small slats that fold out or something. I didn't care too much, it literally took me 3 minutes to cut a $5 thin board, stick some tape on it and done.They also should have a lock in place for the legs at full open, but that's minor."
5,Great little keyboard - if a little sticky,"This keyboard is used with a small 7"" keyboardless machine and being carried with it is the perfect size and weight. It works very well, although sometimes the keys stick if you don't hit them square on from above enough. Having learned to do that, it doesn't then become a problem.It often raises an interested glance from onlookers as they see how small it is, yet perfectly functional.W."
1,Wobbly & non-responsive,"Don't waste your money! I am one handed and thought the small size would help my typing speed (there is a technique for one handed touch typing) but it is just frustrating. Only paid ten bucks but it's not worth five, it's a piece of junk."
2,SO-SO,"I read this book and thought that it was going to be really good. The beginning was good but it focused too much on Carries love for Nathan, and about Cyrus feeling sorry for himself. It started off good but it got boring focusing too much on Cyrus and Carrie. It's allright for a tag sale read but don't pay full price for it. Save your money."
2,Cry me a river......,"This book was annoyingly overly emotional. Just everyone crying, it was pathetic. It had a good story but I couldn't stomach most of the page fillers to get to it. Book one was definitely better."
2,Disappointment.,"I could hardly wait to reach the end of this book. I couldn't get interested in the characters or the action. The book switched between several characters' perspective of the story and I found it momentarily difficult to know which character was the voice. And the end, if you call the setup for book 3 an end, was wam-bam, thank you ma'am, maybe a conclusion next time.. I'm not wasting my money on either book 1 or book 3."
1,Total bust!,When I got them out the actual float (boat) looked like it would be very durable. I purchased two (unfortunately) I put the batteries in and put them together. I put them in the water of a small lake with a 45 pound child in one and a 70 pound child in the other. They barely moved then one quit completely within 5 minutes. The other continued to barely move for another 5 minutes. I took them out to be sure the battery connection was not wet as indicated in the instructions. I dried everything off and put new batteries in them just to be sure. Both propellers ran again until I put them into the water. VERY disappointing that I spent that much money and even more disappointing for something that we were so excited to use didn't work!!
3,its a quick cheap trek fix,i loved the movies i watched them a few times but noticed the films are the old versions like fist time on dvd old thev been remastered few times why not use thos lol and the boxes are cheap outer box is verry fragile but nice to look at and the dvd cases are so cheap the dvd's are hard to take out i almost broke final frontier and the cases themselfs are scratched n scuffed right out of the plastic. overall the price should be 45.00 but i still love trek n waiting for the blu ray colletion. buy this if u just want the movies now. if not pay for the amazon video on demand all the trek movies are hq.
5,Star Trek Movie set,"The packaging was great, delivery very prompt. I love this and my son was so excited to get it for Christmas. Thanks again."
4,Star Trek Movie Series- Great Content- Poor Packaging,"The movie quality is great and the additional material is wonderful. The only downside to this set is the quality of the packaging. The cardboard case is flimsy and provides no real support for the films. It is for show only. The individual movie cases are difficult to deal with. The 2 discs are overlapped in the case and you must remove the movie disc to get to the feature disc. In addition, there is no release mechanism in the case for the DVD's. You just pull them off the plastic retainer. It always feels like the movie is going to break before it comes free. Still, great set for the price."
4,From a Star Trek Fan,"Ten films for approx. $80 was a great price! Three of the six movies with the original cast provide very enjoyable viewing--II, III, and IV. The first film was very forgettable--boring plot, slow paced. If you were a Star Trek series fan, and hadn't seen the ""regular stars"" in awhile, it would be mildly entertaining from a ""reunion"" aspect. Movies V and VI were adequate, but not especially riveting. I think my favorite dvd is ""Star Trek Generations"" that combines both the old and newer cast members. All three of the ""Next Generation"" dvds are entertaining with very watchable plots. I would recommend the entire collection to Star Trek fans. If you are a moderate fan, you might consider individual purchase of the ""best"" films in the set (II, III, IV with original cast and all three Next Generation films)."
5,sountrack to an unmade film..,"this is some of the best experimental electronic ambient material i've heard. yea, i AM the resident expert, so what about it? anyhoo, here we have christoph heemann, natvie of hamburg, germany using a rich pallate of sound to create a cinematic backdrop that has to be some of the most inventive work i've heard makin' the rounds in the whole omnious drone genre.. i think it's his best solo effort, or at least his most sonically active and eclectic. do i hear snippets of 60's spy muzak in there? yep i sure do.. is that followed up with pristine, meditative, spiritual electronic minimalism that rivals c. palastine? sure is... i will spare those who stumble upon this review any pretentious metaphor,.... and since its a subjective thing, it will probably evoke different stuff in different folks.. be assured though: its a VERY evocative album. cover art kinda sucks, but who cares, right... get this thing and get it quick. oh wait, it's out of stock, [darn!]"
1,A half quack arm chair expert,"This fellow is an arm chair quack. He grew up in Pakistan, but that's all about it. Now he makes his living saying cocophony about Pakistan and that region of the world on US TV networks. And with so many networks looking to fill up their airtime, he is having no trouble making this living. He has no clue of what the conditions are on the ground in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Says that Musharraf could have 'nipped the evil in the bud' if he had acted sooner in Swat. If Musharraf had done that, then Mr Rashid would have accused Musharraf of being trigger happy. So if you can see, Mr. Rashid is just a monday morning quarter back. All he is doing is second guessing whatever Musharraf does. And in a couple of months he'll be doing the same with the new govt. in Pakistan, because that's what the US TV networks want him to say.Why would you pay to read baloney from such a quack?"
4,The first book to turn to,"If you want to learn about the Taliban, turn here first. Rashid gives you a clear picture of what the Taliban is, how it came to be, and why it came to be. It's a journalistic book, full of dates and names, but it's also a very engrossing tale of tragedy upon tragedy, and includes some interesting chapters on oil interests in Afghanistan."
5,Insights for thinking about our government's actions,"A completely readable book that analyzes many dimensions of the situation in Afghanistan. I was particularly amazed by the amount of oil/gas business that is being conducted in the area, and Afghanistan's potential role. The recommendations at the end of the book are insightful, and somewhat at odds with our government's ""we are not nation builders"" philosophy. Yet, the consequences of our past and current actions are well spelled out in this book."
4,Dazzling account of Afghanistan of today,"One of the few shortfalls in Taliban - Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia is that Ahmed Rashid makes it interesting to the extent, that he, in an effort to cover the lot, unfortunately fails to lend real and actual justice to the embryonic theory ""The New Great Game"", i e the basic political reality comprising the terms and concepts revealed in the rest of the book's title plus two oil multinationals and advocates of their interests. Rashid, one of few international journalists and experts to have interviewed the Taliban, provides an account of and an extensive background to a major part of today's political and religious happenings, not just in Central, but also South Asia and the Mid-East. Cheers Rashid, for managing to portray the controversial Taliban.Hansi Elsbacher, journalist"
5,The best-researched assessment of the Taliban,"This book is the the most thoroughly researched book on the Taliban that has crossed my path. I may differ with Rashid in some points of his analysis, but his credentials and eyewitness experience are unassailable. This book will hopefully lay to rest speculative and poorly written analyses like Peter Marsden's book of the same name. To simply read this book as an indictment of the Taliban is to make a grave mistake, as it is its attention to the occasional strengths and good intentions of the Taliban which really set it apart from the usual Western propaganda anthologies. It is the even-handedness and personal knowledge of the author which makes this book outstanding."
2,Not what i ordered,I choose the correct type and brand of car....when the bands get here in Dom Rep i go to the mechanic and when we try tu put the bands they don`t fit. they`re smaller for the mazda miata 2005. Now i got those bands here and i lose my money
3,Big GAY Musical,"This movie wasn't exactly what I expected from the preview that I saw online. I expected that it would be a musical with a gay theme, which is fine by me. It was actually part musical/part gay porn. I didn't like that aspect, it was a sickening display. The special features included a section that would play just the musical and so I decided to watch just that. The musical itself wasn't funny it was actually kind of lame. Anyway I would only recommend this movie if you like to watch gay porn."
4,I would have given this five stars,"but I'm not a fan of musicals and wouldn't want to encourage Casper Andreas to make another one. That said, I have to admit that I really enjoyed this. Liz McCartney is great throughout, and the finale she sings is powerful and touching."
1,Another Misleading Title,It is frustrating to search for a book and get mislead by it's title such as in this book. I agree with the first reviewer that this book does not offer much for someone looking for a COMPLETE solution manual to a good physics book. It has the solution for less than 5% of the questions at the end of each chapter and is certainly not worth the price charged. I am sorry but I think when you write a 'solution manual' then every question in the book deserves an answer.
4,Gentle Introduction to Timeless Principles...,"""The Secret of Letting Go"" is a gentle introduction to mysticism, nonduality or ""The Perennial Philosophy."" Finley is an expert at avoiding confusing terminology and new-age pap and gently introducing timeless and true spiritual principles to the beginner. Yet it is not without value to those who have had some experience with the nondual perspective. Of all Finley's books, this is probably the best."
1,Somewhat useful,".... The subject content is simple and straightforward enough: Let go of self-defeat and release your inner strength. What really annoys me to no end about this book, and why the book wasn't very helpful at all, is primarily his obnoxious writing style. He writes like this throughout the book: to NOT be aware of what you DON'T want is in truth what you CAN'T change. And you're shaking your head, what did he just say there? So, you spend more time than you should translating these ridiculous double-negative inverted statements into something simple, as they should be, that makes sense. I am currently re-reading the book to try and understand what he's really saying. I found Anthony Robbins book, 'Unlimited Power' to be clearly written without all the verbal game-playing, and much more helpful in content."
4,Breathe..& Let GO!,"I downloaded this on Kindle & especially enjoy reading when I am anxious or fearful!As a recovering 'Codependent', this is key."
4,THE SECRET OF LETTING GO,the book in question is a very informative . It can help in making the decision if you are one of those people who cannot decide. I find that it is almost like a text book that could be used at a seminar. Hope someone else likes it.
1,Complete garbage,"Read the bible. You'll get a whole universe more of life substance than from all of Mr. Finley's books and tapes combined. I purchased a cassette selection from The Ken Roberts Company and I was immediately disappointed. In fact, I felt ripped off. There are many of these new age, mystical ""wizards"" running around today."
1,Gave up two-thirds the way through.,"This is the most horrific self-help book I have ever ran across. The writing style is difficult to even read. Seemingly insiteful sentences and paragraphs are nothing but gibberish. It is like listening to a bhuddist monk that has had way too much to drink. There is no logic in the progression, interjections and points seem tangential. The stories he uses as analogy are pointless, far-fetched, and nonsensical. I kept returning to the book in the hopes that it would start making sense, or even become readable, and I made a concerted effort to 'stay with it', but eventually just tossed it into the Goodwill pile, saying 'enough is enough'."
1,This guy is full of it.,"The author goes on about how if you are unhappy with the situation you find yourself in then you should change your reaction to that situation not the situation. If my job sucks because theres nothing to do all day but surf the web I should change my boredom into something else? Should i make myself happy to be doing nothing all day? Even better if I'm a woman who's being repeatedly and severely physically abused by my husband, I should not change the situation, I should change my reaction? Should I make myself happy that this is happening? Perhaps I missed something but this guy is giving out not just bad advice but dangerous advice."
2,Sneaky,"I began reading the sample, and enjoyed it enough to spend the $2.99. Once I read the next chapter though, I became sorely disappointed. Smart marketing to end the sample where it ended in order to get a person to purchase the book.The writing is too ""wordy"" and just ends up getting more ""wordy"" as the book goes on. The point of the book is great and makes sense, but the approach and delivery makes it almost seem as if the author was just trying to fill pages.I would return it if I could."
3,Letting Go Review,"This book is not easy to follow a definite scheme of things and while it is full of useful information, I did not find it a clear step by step approach to implementing theories. It may have more appeal to a definitely more intellectual person, but for the average person's use, it is not an easy read."
4,fun,"This book is excitiinig and shows alot of fellings.Some times I think this book was made for me. This is my first book I've read that Luis has wrote.Thats what I think about this book ,and I hope I will find more of his books . He has a great taste of writing ."
5,Greatest book of all !!,"Harriet the Spy is an 11 year old girl who keeps painful but true notes in her notebook. Soon her notebook falls into the wrong hands and everyone in her class, even her two best friends, are against her. Then she must pay them back, but is revenge the answer? Or will she give up her notebook? And will put her life right side up?Harriet the Spy is a great book with adventure, comedy and friendship. This is a book you can't put down, you have to keep on reading. But this book also shows you that revenge only causes more trouble.To find out the amazing ending, read the great book Harriet the Spy."
4,Harriet The Spy,"Harriet The Spy I think is a fabulous book to read. The story is about a little girl named Harriet who acts like a real spy. She sneaks into other pepoles houses.She also litens to other pepoles confersations. You'll be suprised on what she pulls together.I think that anyone with an imagination would love this book.So,if you have an imagenation I think you need to read this book."
2,Very unlikeable main character.,"I realize this book is supposed to be humorous as well as a realistic portrayal of a rich girl whose most inner thoughts are discovered, but I found Harriet's actions to be more irritating than funny. Yes, there are a few laughs and the author tells a good story, but it's hard to get by the fact that Harriet would be hated in most schools because of what she thinks of others, and because she is a spoiled BRAT. All she thinks about is herself, and acts like a jerk when Ole Golly leaves. I don't have the least bit of sympathy for this whiner. There are a lot of cruel things said and done to people in this book, and the Janie character wanting to blow up the school seems to be inappropriate in today's day and age, since kids are actually doing that and it's not funny anymore. Sorry if you liked this book. I didn't. (The movie was actually better.)"
1,Caution: darkness and complexity ahead,"Just a cautionary note to parents. This isn't a ""fun"" or innocent book for younger children, as you might imagine from a cursory look, or from what you might glean from the title and packaging. We got a few chapters into to before my daughter asked (begged) me to stop reading it. A lot of it is just downright mean, and not in any helpful sense. On reflection, why would we want to introduce young kids to such themes as alienation, existentialism, class warfare, entitlement, and on and on? Can't we allow them a few years of innocence and fun before the onslaught of the teenage turmoil and adulthood? And some of the effort to introduce complexity comes across as risible. I mean quoting Dostoesky? Honestly, how pretentious. If you want darkness, stimulation, character development, and excellent writing in a completely original imaginative landscape then try the Guardians of Ga'hoole series. My 8-year old has read the first seven volumes and can't put them down."
5,Should be on every preteen's reading list!,"When I was in 5th grade, this book made the rounds of every girl in theclass -- and many of the boys. Recently, after seeing the movie, I wasprompted to go back and reread the book. (I cried this time too!) Evenafter nearly 30 years, very little of it seems dated; the subjects ofdivorce and social alienation are possibly even more pertinent today. Ican also highly recommend this book's sequel, The Long Secret"
4,A must-read for kids 9-12! Highly enjoyable.,"As many teachers do, I try to preview and read books before I introduce them into the classroom. This summer I read a slew of books and really enjoyed Harriet the Spy.It was written like nothing I have ever read before. Harriet is a different breed altogether. She is going through great changes in her life and is not even that likable as a person. However, she is very real. Her situations and her explorations are strange, unique and funny. I wish I had read this in the fifth grade! I really think that my students are going to love and enjoy it when I read this book out loud to them this coming school year.You'll enjoy Harriet's spying escapades, the characters she views and writes in her journal about and her outlook on friends and family. The other characters in the book are equally off-beat, real and hilarious. Harriet the Spy is a masterpiece of children's literature and one to be enjoyed for years to come I hope."
4,Its fun!,"Its really good for a family. I really like the co-op part. Its hard though cause the camera position cant be changed, and you really have to work together to get stuff done.I also like Tak The Great JuJu Challenge, Thats a really good co-op game."
2,Good... for the kiddies,"I got Shrek 2 a couple christmases (is that right?) ago, and i gotta say it was alright. the pros are that it is up to four players ( so if dad wants to spend ""quality"" time with junior), it has a wide variety of fun characters, and plenty of levels.HOWEVER, it lacks graphics, and young children might not do well during the game. but overall its alrightGraphics: C/ It must have been released early, cuz it's pretty badSound: B+/ crisp sounds. the sound really matches the mood.Controls: A-/ Changing and controlling characters' a breezeGood for children and adults to."
3,Enternaining,"This game although it can be fun, yet it can be quite tedious. You will need a lot of patience to play it."
3,Its OK.....,"I bought this game after I saw the movie. The movie was great, and I thought the game would be just as good. I played this game for about 15 min. and put it down. On the bright side, the graphics are great and its quite funny.PROS:-game control-quite funny-graphicsCONS:-replay valueOverall- 6\10"
2,A GOOD PHRASE FOR THEFIRST MAKE FUN OF REALITY CARTOON SHOW,NOW THIS A NEW SHOW THAT IS COMING OUT ON OCTOBER 4 THAT THEY MIX DIFFERENT KINDS OF FAMOUS DRAWINGS AND MAKE FUN OF IT BY TRYING TO GROSE PEOPLE OR OFFEND WHITH IS THE JOKE OF THE SHOW WHITCH THE NEW SEASON OF DRAWN TOGETHER COMES BACK ON TV OCTOBER 19 WITH SOUTH PARK WHITCH THE SOUTH PARKTHE6TH SEASON COMES OUT AWEEK AFTER THE DRAWN TOGETHERT SEASON 1 COMES OUTWHITCH DRAWN TOGETHER DOES GET OLD BY WATCHING IT.
2,Great show!!! HORRIBLE DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You know the show...if you don't...go get a clue.Basically, this DVD for the first season was thrown together with tape and bits of string. Poor content, redundant material....banged out and sold to you for a quick buck!I love the show but I sure hope the 2nd season DVD is of better quality!!!!!"
1,Very Uncensored,"Though the show is clever in the ways it makes fun of reality tv and famous cartoon characters, I found it gross and very inappropriate. I bought it for a friend for his birthday, and wish I hadn't watched it. It is just terrible and disgusting."
5,Hilarious!,I play this over & over for my friends they all love it. This is better than stand-up comedy.
4,Entire album is good,"excellent CD - as another reviewer mentioned, found the Pretty Little Thing single on iTunes - loved it and went looking for more from Fink. THis album is great, all of the way through.One item to note - Amazon has messed up the metadata with Fink's Import Single and the full album. I called them to help get it fixed (the way they have it now, you can purchase the entire album for the cost of the import single), and the two Amazonians I talked to were quite rude - fun stuff! This site is nice, but never try to deal with anyone behind the scenes. They are messed up.Back to the album review. It's great. If you like the Pretty Little Thing single, you'll like the rest."
4,Great Country French resource,"Lots of good details on Country French Living, and great photos also. Really am enjoying Charles Faudree's ebook - it gives me great ideas on how to pull things together to get the look I want."
3,pictures are gorgeous but need to be more descriptive,"The pictures are gorgeous , There are great photos of projects, the text is both educational and interesting but not like french country signature the book need to be more descriptive , you will find general design information that make the rooms just a cut above other designs."
3,library book,I was disappointed to find that the book was an out of circulation library book from Florida. It had the plastic cover and call numbers still on the book. I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known this.
2,pornopets,"Tara Patrick, Devon, and Devon LAne are all Porn stars. It seems like 50% of Penthouse Pets are. Not to be hypocritical, but they could spend a little time and money bringing NEW BEAUTIFUL girls to their mag and vids...like Playboy does.So go to a video store and rent a pet-porn vid for 3 bucks, then if you want to see a softcore version of the same girl(With better make up, lighting, and ""production"" values then get a penthouse video."
3,Bug fix,"This device is just another MP3 player amongst many but with some flaws. The size is fine for the small price of under 20 bucks but nothing higher. There is a bug in the device that after so long its not accessible via usb to computer. to fix this you need to update its firmware. There are many online tutorials to resolve this, just research the model number and firmware update. Should be about 9 steps. Overall an ok product but another example of why ""top"" names are not always better."
2,Looks really cheap,I liked the concept and needed some extra drink storage for my boat. The Amazon product image was a pencil sketch and seemed ok. When the product arrived and I saw what it looked like for the first time I regretted buying it. It's very cheap looking and very basic. I expected a much better product based on the price. I was going to order two and give one as a gift but I'm glad I didn't.The two drink holders are different sizes. One will hold a typical canned drink and the other is slimmer and will hold a narrow bottle. There are slots for fishing tools but tools restrict access to the drinks especially when mounted on a seat pedestal.
2,"stick to the witches, buchan!","some really really great descriptions here, of forest and sabbaths. the greatest i have read in fact. a priest tries to persuade his congregation to become good christians. some worship ancient religions. there is a coven performing rituals in the woods. if only Buchan would have sticked to that. but no. intrigues, a love story, doubts, and worst of all: another story completely different than this is formed, and this story is boring. for political reasons the priest needs to defend an action. and that destroys the previous story. in the end it all becomes a mediocre blur."
4,Interesting!,pretty good book with great pictures. Historically interesting.Look it up if you are interested in biochemistry. That's all really.
3,Not as Much Science as Hoped,"As mentioned in the synopsis, this book contains much of the story behind the discovery and isolation of fluorescent proteins. But more specifically it's about the scientist's lives, and how their discoveries impacted future research. While the history lesson was interesting, it did not contain enough specifics on the biophysics of protein function for my taste. In light of the book being almost entirely a narrative, I would've enjoyed a few more pictures. If you want the inside story on Glo-fish, buy it, if you're looking for detailed information on GFP, and related proteins, skip it."
5,A thorough and valuable resource for Bible study,"Ok, reviewing Bible dictionaries or commentaries is very subjective from reader to reader. I will simply say that this dictionary has always met everything I needed in a Bible dictionary. There are other dictionaries just as good or maybe even better but I still have no problem in easily recommending this book."
3,Fragile and a little too big,"I have found this device to be a little too big. It's not like those slim usb devices that fit any computer. If you have other ports close, you'll have to either disconnect them or use an extention cable (included).It's also a little too big to look good hanging from your neckstrap. And it's case is not sturdy and fixed, rather is made from a cheap plastic cover and it seems there's a lot of empty space within. The could've made it smaller. If you shake it you can hear some moving parts!!!But it works fine."
3,"A world-view, not a travel guide","The best thing Mr. Dertouzos does in this book is introduce a useful paradigm in which to view the digital future. His initial description of (and continual references to) ""the Information Marketplace,"" offers the most complete and concrete metaphor for the Digital Age. This is an example anyone can uderstand and use. His specifics, however, will leave many readers disappointed. It isn't that he's wrong, it's that constant media hype on innovations has made his examples familiar and a little stale. Strongly recommended for the technical novice, but a miss for those already online"
5,Rating: netheads -3; net neophytes - 10,"I gave this two ratings because (in spite of what the book cover spiel says - "".. written for every reader affected by technological change - both the digital sophisticate and those still struggling to understand e-mail""), my guess is that most net heads will find this book boring, as a lot of this is self-evident. Having said that, because netheads are a minority (at least today), *MOST* people will find this book very good. I think that Michael does an *EXCELLENT* job of keeping the techno-babble to a minimum, and clearly explaining *HOW* the net, the information highway, the WWW or whatever you want to call it, will affect us todmorrow, and how it is affecting us today. Another good book that complements this is: The Digital Estate, by Chuck Martin"
4,Worth the price,Used it a couple weeks ago and it went up easy and was plenty big enough for 2 adults. Only small complaint is that the bag it comes in is a little small when it comes to taking it down.
3,Interesting but lacks depth,"This is an odd book. It brings together the graphic novel and North Korean austerity. Canadian animator Guy Delisle spent time in North Korea, which has apparently become the new favored source for cheap animation labor. In this book Delisle captures the absurdities of life in Pyongyang, more through pictures than through words. Only one floor of Delisle's massive hotel has electricity, there's bizarre and uninspired food, and minimal recreation activities. Delisle brings a copy of 1984 with him, and North Korea is certainly an Orwellian society.I think I would have found this book more effective if I didn't really know anything about North Korea. There's nothing really surprising here. I enjoyed Delisle's drawings, but I felt like there was too much drawing and not enough narrative. I think I'd have preferred an art exhibit to a book. Ultimately the book lacks depth, and the illustrations don't make up for what the writing lacks."
4,Good but not genius,"Unfortunately I do agree with the person who felt slight disappointment with the artwork - and I found depth of penetration of the subject slightly disappointing too. And yet the book did leave a deep impression on me, of shock, and so I would recommend it. it's educative too - I knew nothing of N Korea before. There are some other artists' work in this book, which form part of the narrative for a few pages, and their work is vv impressive. But maybe the stark style that G de L has plumped for matches the subject matter, stark, and kind almost sterile. Still v well drawn though, just basic at the same time. Def worth a look though, v interesting indeed."
2,booooooring,"I lasted almost twenty minutes. Kept waiting for something other than boo hoo, my girlfriend left me and my car doesn't work. i wanted both main charachters to get hit by a train."
5,Fun for kids and the not so hard core gamers.,"We bought this for my 6 y/o daughter to go with the X-Box we bought for Christmas. We have not owned a game system except for a game-boy since the original Nintendo came out. This game has been fun for us all. We all play at the same time, which makes for some family fun. My daughter is able to play some alone without getting too frustrated and does well when we all play. Personally I enjoy the comedic elements that have been well thought out. If you are a hard core gamer you will probably get bored of it quickly. It may not be as challenging as you like. We have gotten over half way through without a cheat book, which is amazing for most games."
3,A Pretty Good Shrek Game!,"Shrek 2 is a much better game than the first one. In Shrek 2, you can play up to four characters at once. You can play as 9 characters total. The game takes events from the movie and makes them longer, and also makes up new stuff. My only complaints are that the graphics are really ametuerish and that when you leave the game, you have to start the level over. Buy Shrek 2, and leave Shrek 1 alone on the shelf."
1,Worst electronics ever,"Here is another victim of the notorious LENS CAP ERROR. I bought this crappy product in December 2005 as a gift to my father. It's now trashed. My father said he took good care of the cam and never pointed it to strong light.Looking at the previous reviews, I'm amazed there have been sooooo many other victims. How could such a trash product ever made to the market? Also it's shameless how JVC is treating its customers."
4,I love this little bugger!,"This camera is great! Since it is the lower of the models it doesn't have as many features as some of the high models. This model requires a firewire hookup to a PC instead of the more common USB. It fits great in your hand and has great picture quality. I've been VERY happy with this camera and I would recommend it. (but if you want a few more small conveniences, maybe bump up to the next model...)"
1,Lens Cap problem again but fixed for free,"My model is JVC GR-D33U. It works great before I got the famous Lens Cap problem. I filled in a request at their customer support web page. To my surprise, a week later I received an email and JVC offered to fix it for free even it passed the support period. After sending out my camcorder for one week and receiving no feedback at all, I received the camera through UPS and the problem was fixed. JVC didn't bother to follow up.I encourage everyone with similar problem do the same thing and maybe JVC can fix yours for free as well."
4,"Awesome, stunning",Ive fallen in love with this series. Simply the most stunning and in some ways silly stories i've read in a long time.
2,not on my top Deerhoof list.....,"If you're going to give Deerhoof a listen. I would put Apple O', Runner's four and Friend Opportunity(#1)Friend OpportunityThe Runners FourApple O'choice. There are 3 of their most mature and accessible releases and at the top of my listen to Deerhoof list. Milkman and Halfbird last on this list. I have not heard any of their other older releases but if Halfbird and Milkman are indicators I'll pass on those as well."
4,Good Toy,This is a great toy for children to develop their fine motor skills but there is no way to lock the pieces in place. This makes in very inconvenient for taking the toy with you.
2,Sexy but uncomfy,"It's definitely a sexy boot, but ever so uncomfortable. Hard bottom and if you have a large leg, it only stretches but so far. Yeah, wasn't pleased with this purchase at all."
2,Not quite a variety pack,"I was disappointed that 20 of the 27 sheets were the identical (Circles w/ fruit smell). Only 3 of the 27 sheets were stars. Not quite the variety I was expecting.Otherwise, the quality is OK, but not as nice as some others. My kids always peel and re-stick to get them in the position they want. These stickers tend to tear or get damaged when removing."
1,Not for me,I am used to using the behind the head stereo headset which is great if you get a good one. The problem is they cost $20 and sometimes do not work when you get them. Its a pain to keep returning them too. So I thought of giving this a try. I didn't like it at all. I am keeping it because it works and will use it in between trying to get a good stereo one from time to time. Why in this amazing time of electronics can we still not get a good reliable headset???
5,Plantronics M175 Convertible Mobile/Cordless Headset,I would buy this again. It works very well and shipped quick. It has clear sound on all my calls.
3,Just Okay,This book was just okay. It was kinda of slow at the beginning but it picked up at the end. Reminds you that you never know who your friends are and everything happens for a reason.
1,Noticed no difference,I was skeptical about this product from the get go. There are lots of reports out there that say ZMA does nothing. Sadly I'm going to have to agree with those reports. This didn't help me sleep better or with anythign else that I can tell.
3,side affects,i introduced zma into my supplement routine a while ago which included protein shakes and creatine. i did see awesome strength gains but unfortunately it gave me terrible facial acne. all the strength in the world was not worth lookimg like a pizza face.
5,finally found - magic slate item,"Finally found a source for this ""magic slate"" item. My kids LOVE this product. With no messy pens/ink to ruin their clothes. A fun source of continuing enjoyment -- the slates are kept in my car for their entertainment while traveling to/from school, shopping, everywhere."
5,Love it,"This is a great game. Although we play it so much, we go thru batteries once a month, it's sooooo worth it"
3,We bought this for my 7 year old,"He has only played with it the first few weeks he got it. I think it is cool, but now days they have x-box and playstation so the graphics on this is not what an older child finds cool. I love all the old game and this is nice because of no cartridges. The only plug n play my son really liked was the Pac Man and the frogger. He plays x-box and that may be why."
2,Good and Bad,"I really wanted to like these for the price. Optically, they are very good if not outstanding for the price. Images are sharp across the entire field. Brightness is good, but not outstanding compared a 50mm finderscope that I have. However, mechanically they are awful... Changing the focus pushes up one ocular more than the other so changing focus means that the left and right eyepiece is ALWAYS out of focus and you have to change the right diopter. Close focus distance was listed at 17ft, but it is really about 100ft so it's useless for birding or night navigation in the harbor."
2,Didn't do what I expected,"I'm not a hunter and have never had a need for a bone saw so maybe my expectations weren't realistic. I had just got a German Shepherd puppy and was told to give her marrow bones to help with the teething. The dog loves the bones but I couldn't always get small enough bones for her. I figured I could use the saw to cut the larger bones in half. It took forever to saw through the bone and it was really a lot of effort. I gave up on this experiment. If the meat cutters aren't around to cut the bones to size, the pup is out of luck. I give her some other type of toy to chew on. But like I said, maybe my expectations weren't realistic."
1,Beware!,We received only Volume 2 of the two volume set. I did not discover the error until the day of the class when I needed the volume they did not send. I am really upset. These bozos did not indicate ANYWHERE that they were sending only one of the two volumes.
2,A PS 1 Generation Game,"I purchased this game on June 29 and popped it in immediately, getting all revved up for the enjoyable experiance of being everyone's favorite friendly neighborhood spidermanThen the load screen happened, and I gasped.The colours only use a 4 wheel spectrum for the most part dating back to the origianl spider man comic book game on the PS1. The characters mouths don't move, the hands are mittens and the colours when you get up close aren't that great either.Now the game play. The swing machanics, even on extreme, are simplistic and do what the game tells them to, as for roaming around the city, it's not enjoyable or fun. You have maybe 4 variety of missions which you MUST do before getting on with this story. None of them are fun or creative.This game does deserve two stars though for voice acting, it's tremedously good and corny. What you'd expect from a spiderman era game."
4,A Great Game,"I bought the game yesterday (July 3), and I have been playing it ever since. It is GTA (without carjacking) meets THUG (without skateboarding) meets the Spider-Man comic book. This game is amazingly fun to play, if you're playing the missions, or just taking a ""Spidey"" tour of The Big Apple. This game does not stick to the storyline, it adds characters in, such as Mysterio, Shocker, and Black Cat. It does use the storyline of the movie as a plotline basis, though. The one problem that I have with this game, however is the graphics. I feel that they can be much better than they already are, but in a game as fun as this, who cares?"
4,AWESOME,it a pretty fun game but its kinda hard like what up with that??? i cant pass the sports arena but it came fast i thought it was coming in a week but it came inn a couple of days THANKS AMAZON! IM BUYING FROM HERE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE =)
3,spiderman 2,You can only go to mary janes apartment and then it gets stuck on loading of the game and will not continue.
4,GET IT!!,"Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can. Spins a web any size. Catches thieves just like flys. Look out, here comes the spider-man!The game is going to be just like that. BUY IT NOW!"
2,A Brief Look at the LDS Church and Las Vegas,"This short book was good, but not great. To be a great book, a real ""page turner,"" it perhaps would have been helpful to make it a little thicker and told in a storytelling style. As a reader, I felt as though I was being barraged with a bewildering array of people and place names that I was expected to consider familiar.This book might be interesting to someone interested in Mormonism and/or Las Vegas, but is probably best for a member of the LDS church who has a personal acquaintance with modern Las Vegas already.One last thing, it is WAY overpriced."
5,Straight Forward,"I have to give it to Dr Rita Louise on this one. Most books you read addressing spiritual development seem to be written for someone that is spiritually evolved. Rita takes you step by step through a realistic process that can improve your life. She helps you understand how your ""power within"" relates to your everyday life and how to change it for the better. I recommend."
1,boring,"Kittle's playing is uninspiring. I found no character. His constant use of white notes and ""wailing"" attempting to give something of musicality is a turnoff. Besides he might consider obtaining a better instrument. His sound is quite mediocre and if he calls this playing jazz, I am on another planet."
3,From Back Cover,"One look. One dance. One night of passion. Julianne McKenzie had experienced it all with one sexy man. And now she was expecting a child, the Cherokee baby of Bobby Elk. What other surprises did life have in store?Too much heartache. Too much to atone for. Bobby Elk believed he lacked the soul to give Juianne all she deserved. She carried his child, and his Cherokee heritage demanded he give them a home, yet he dared not give them his name, his heart.Three souls bound by one fateful enounter. Man. Woman. Child. But their circle would never be complete until one man faces his greatest fear... and one woman showed him how deserving he was of love."
1,Original Stage Manager,"As one of the three original stage managers of ""Sherry"", I have waited for years for some sort of album, having ruined my hearing listening to the tape made on the backstage squak box. How sorry to now have heard the version that has been recored. It is not the version that we opened with in NY rather the version that we did in Boston and was being cut even before the opening there. When Joe Layton was brought in we rehearsed his version during the day and performed the ""old"" version at night until the middle of the run in Philadelphia. That was when Clive Revill took over as Sherry with Delores Grey and Liz Allen staying. It's a shame no quality recoring was made then. Listening to this version does not bring back fond memories."
4,Hospital killer,"This book is some what good, if you're in coma.I was in ahospital room doing this campaign with an injured friend. The guyacross from us was in a coma and he got out of it to tell us that thebook was horrible, then he died from boredom. So if you plan on getting this don't play in a hospital. Only play it in a mental hospital where people are insane anyways. ...the story reminds me of The Lion King. I f you actually play this and retain your sanity then I commend you for your superior mind."
1,A complete and total waste of money!,"I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. This ebook is nothing more than 1) a regurgitation of (simplistic) legal do's & don'ts and 2)generalized information. The description of the book's contents is grossly misleading. If you're seeking specific help with learning proper interviewing skills and/or tips & tricks, you won't find it here.If you're considering this ebook, here's my recommendation: LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
5,Great game - Not what I expected,"A First Person Action game - from Disney! Usually Disney's movie-to-games are flat, unimaginative puzzles that bore my kids within seconds. But Atlantis is something new. It's entirely in 3D, which for kids' games is extremely rare. Having not seen the movie I can't say how well it compares, but it does an amazing job of putting the player ""in"" the game. Visually it is first rate, obviously a lot of creativity went into the production.Bottom line, my kids love it (2 boys and a girl). The multiplayer aspect of the game (you can go online and play against other people) is the biggest draw for them. Every time they play it's a new game, with new people doing unpredictable things. It worked out of the box, getting online to play is all built in, though my seven year old had to walk me through it the first couple of times.Great gameplay, very impressive graphics, seemingly endless replayability, and my kids love it. And I play it, too.Who needs a movie?"
2,Don't waste your time.,"This is a book that I had no difficulty putting down, and did many times. Its author, purportedly a historian, should have at least written an outline before setting his thoughts to pen. I still don't quite know why Poincare's syncronus clock acheivments are related to Einstein's theory of relativity and certainly the author's several attempts to explain relativity by example is gibberish. Save your money and buy a good clock."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I don't think this subject warrants a book of this length.Whilst there is a story there, it could have been much shorter, and so the book drags it all out, wandering off at tangents before coming back.The illustrations & photographs were poorly reproduced and poorly chosen - why we needed to see the public clocks in Berne that Einstein would have seen on his way to work confused me."
3,"It's OK, But...","This was my first Ridley Pearson, and I borrowed it. I can only rate it as OK, because the sub-plot with the kid, Emily, and Daphne was only average as plot exposition, at times a bit irritating. I don't rate it higher primarily because Mr. Pearson doesn't know the difference between the Army and the Air Force and didn't bother to find out. The Air Force has Security Police, not Military Police, and its criminal investigation element is called the Office of Special Investigations. The Criminal Investigation Division he wrote about refers to the US Army Criminal Investigation Command. He also wrote his base commander as an unknowing idiot, which didn't set well with this veteran (yes, some are idiots, but I don't want to read it in a mystery novel). How Lou handles Liz' health problems may cause me to pick up a sequel, but only if a friend loans it. I'm not inclined to buy it. Maybe if a loaned copy shows distinct improvement in writing--we'll see."
2,Only o.k.for a plane ride or if you're in labor.,"Not enough character development, plot is replete with unanswered questions and coincidences. If Boldt's wife is so sick, why is he out running away from responsibility? Or is that what we do with all mysteries? Or with all life."
5,The Best,I came across this nail product when looking for a basecoat and strengthner. This product is the best. My nails grow at rapid speed and strength and health. I went back to get another bottle since I've run out. No where can I find it. I told the beauty supply clerk I'll go on line. and so I did and ordered another bottle. it's the greatest product for nails.
5,A World of Color,"I absolutely loved this book. Although I read it mainly for my interest in mosaics, I found many of the collages appealing as well. The photos are wonderful, colorful and display a great sense of creativity. What a happy feeling this rainbow of colors gives to a person inhabiting these unique rooms. And isn't that what decorating is all about? This book is a must for every creative mind!"
5,More!,"I wish that there could be an unending stream of these books. They are sumptuous in and of themselves, and I love making the projects in them."
4,A great collection of faith,Here I am once again to listen to a great gospel. This music can relieve your soul. Read the message in it.
3,life story?,"The songs were great, I really enjoyed this video, the only thing that has stopped me from rating a higher star was the fact that I feel there could have been less talking about the songs, I really don`t think we need to now the life story of how a song comes to be.I would buy more of Martina`s work providing there is less chatter."
3,"Not amazing, but very funny","I had a good time reading this book because it is very funny and able to make you laugh, but it's extremely harsh sometimes and there are jokes that are not so good because they are prejudiced, but overall, it's a book to take easily, not too much to think about - you just read, comment with your spouse, laugh together, identify yourself with some of the situations described and forget about it!"
3,Lost in translation?,"I was looking forward to this book after seeing Ms. Frost on CNN. While I love the concept and idea behind it, in the final analysis it just isn't all that amusing.After reading it, I wondered if this book had its beginnings in a stand-up routine. I think the material might have worked better in that medium and something got lost in the transition to the book.I know some people are taking offense at the tone the book takes, but it is so over the top I don't know how it can be taken seriously. Comedy like this has its roots in the truth, and let's face it, there are some little monsters out there."
5,"Funny book, good read",Peter Kreeft doesn't get the credit he deserves for writing highly intellectual and yet easy to understand and witty books.
2,May as well read Lewis.,"Not one of Kreeft's better efforts, this imaginary dialog between JFK, Aldous Huxley, and C.S. Lewis fell short of my expectations. The book is all Lewis - Kennedy doesn't offer much substance and Huxley is hardly here at all.I'm a big fan of Lewis and suggest that simplify things and just read his work."
4,COMFY,"Well made very comfortable slipper socks. Slightly big - makes one look like Hobbit - but warm n comfy, & everything I wanted for relaxing at home."
3,"Nice, but size runs a bit small","These are a very decent pair for keeping your feet warm. I found the sizing chart useless, and I re-ordered to get the large. The medium fits a maximum 9 1/2 foot, but you only find that out from the marking on the soles once you get them."
4,"Great, but ugly","I've been wearing Acorn slipper socks for many years. I always liked the way they feel, but they are very poor quality. When my last pair of Acorns started to unravel, I decided to give a pair of blue men's Muk Luks a try. They are superior in quality in all regards. The knitting and stitching are high quality. The leather on the sole is tacky, offering a good grip on all surfaces. They are extremely comfortable. The only negative is that they are ugly. I say ugly, my wife says hideous. Note: as some reviewers have mentioned, they run small. I wear a size 10 shoe, and the Extra Large Muk Luk fits me snugly but nicely. When they arrived, I thought they looked gigantic. My feet say otherwise."
3,Average product,"Not a bad system just not what I expected, fells cheap, can't turn off the voice caller ID, only one ring tone."
2,Typos by the score,"Blackhawk is one of my childhood heros. Growing up along the banks of the Rock River and being interested in Indian lore made it a natural. I have read and enjoyed many books about the man. However the kindle edition is loaded with typos to the point where it is distracting. Great story, but poorly put into kindle format."
5,I love the music. I really like track #6,It's a really good CD. I have a cousin who plays the trumpet and a I think thats why I like this CD.
4,A Good Commentary,"A Oxford Bible Commentary or Wycliffe Bible Commentary this is not. Those commentaries are much more concise. And are much more in use than this one. That's because these are good at word and verse commentary and this one is not.But I still use this Key Word Commentary. Just like the several different Study Bibles I refer to and study from I also research from 3 different commentaries, including this one.And this is handy with my Key Word Study Bible. Gives a good chapter and summary of the Bible.I would still recommend this commentary but don't get your hopes up if your used to using Oxford and Wycliffe Bible Commentaries in the past."
3,extremely brief and elementary,"Each page is on a different chapter of the Bible. There are ten ""headings"" such as key word or key verse which is followed mostly with a single sentence or phrase. If your reading functionality is high enough to read reviews, I suspect that you will be disappointed at the information presented because you could have derived it from your own reading of the chapter.I frequently disagree with the author about what is the key verse and key thought etc.The author far too frequently claims that a description of people or events that could very well be literally true is in reality a symbol for some off the wall thing that the author, to use a phrase from engineering, pulls out of his rectum."
1,Maybe the worst film ever made...,"...or at least in the running. Since everything from the writing to the acting is horrible in this flick, then let me focus on the few positives: Jeanene G. who unfortunately is only in a few sceens, I wanted more of her character as she seems to be the only one of interest, the cinematography is nice. That's about it folks. The lead characters are stupid and annoying, all of the acting is horrible, the script is pathetic, the dialogoue is inane, and worst of all THERE ARE ALMOST NO DOGS IN THE MOVIE! If the director would have just left the camera rolling in dog park to capture the silly things dogs do, this film would have been a 100% more interesting."
1,DON'T buy/rent this movie!,"What's wrong with Hollywood? I cannot believe the producers, directors, actors, etc. of this movie sat in a screening room to watch the final cut and went ahead and released it anyway! The acting, the script, and the plot could not have been worse. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to sit through a ""comedy"" that is not even a little bit funny. I'm not THAT hard to please but I didn't even crack a smile during the grueling course of this flick. What a waste of Janine Garafalo; not that any of her movies are that great. She should probably stick with stand-up. All in all....another example of a comedic failure by Hollywood idiots with more ego than talent."
4,did we see the same movie?,"Wow, after reading the other reviews for this movie, I have to wonder if we saw the same movie. This movie has simply the funniest love scene I have ever seen. This movie was absolutely hysterical (in parts). It dragged in a few places, but the interesting characters and truly bizarre situations were very funny. The humour in this movie is not your standard slapstick or sitcom faux wit, but is more comedy of the absurd. But as you can tell from other reviews, this type of comedy is not for everybody. Anyway, interesting story, interesting characters, but most of all, ridiculous scenes that will make you howl. As the writer is from the Kids in the Hall, several of the actors are from that show. If you liked Kids in the Hall, you'll love this movie."
1,"Cast of Seinfeld turns 'bi,' unfunny and moves to space","Unlikely cast of self absorbed, directionless characters relocate to space in order to contemplate their meaningless existences. Through pages of bad science and even worse sex, they find that, indeed, their existences are meaningless."
5,Worldly Hero,"In this book, Modesitt uses an earthling as his hero. What is unique about this hero is his flaws. Too often, in my opinion, I read of a 'perfect' hero; however, I rather enjoyed reading of the mistakes this hero made and how he dealt with them.As in most science fiction books, a leap of imagination is required, but with the leap made, this book is well worth a read by any reader willing to see it through to the end."
5,From a teacher's view,I am a middle school social studies teacher and I found the poster to really capture my students attention. It is bright and colorful and really shows his picture up close
2,Started out OK,"PERFECT HUSBAND is a watchable film, but far from perfect. It just moves too slowly for its own good. Add the annoying best friend who refused to believe anything bad about Scott Peterson and this made it a reasonably difficult 84 minutes to sit through.Those criticisms aside, Dean Cain was quite good in his role as Scott, as was the grieving Dee Wallace as Laci's mother. However at the end of the day, why does a movie like this get made when this sort of thing goes on all the time every day of the week across the world. Was there something particular about these cirumstances that warranted a film? I ask this because the script for the film was not written well enough to pull the viewer in. Not enough information was presented to the viewer to help us form an opinion."
4,The Perfect Husband,As almost everyone else in the world I was caught up in this case from the beginning. Scott was my suspect from the beginning although I kept an open mind for a brief period. I would give anything to know just exactly what happened that triggered Lacys murder on Christmas eve morning or the night before. It was a good movie but the Amber Frey flick on TV was bettert.
2,Another profile,"Dean Cain did a decent job playing Scott Peterson in this made for TV movie, but quite honestly the story was a bit too choppy to be liked completely. The story of Scott's lies were told as they unfolded, and what a liar he was! As Scott was playing the happy family man who was reluctantly waiting for the arrival of his first child with his wife, Laci, he was leading a double life as a swinging single bachelor with his girlfriend Amber on the side. Amber is a subject of pity, no question, as she was lied to and drawn into this media circus as an innocent, but his phone calls to her are almost hilarious as he attempts to lie to Amber, his family and the public of his innocence. It's an ok profile of Scott the man, might give others insights into how he tried to lie and cheat and sneak his way out of the murder, but it leaves a few things to the imagination of wanting him to just fess up. Then again, that's how Scott was/is."
3,Great actor !,Dean Cain was a great actor in the dvd of the perfect husand : Lacie Peterson story and worth checking out the movie for 1
2,Perfect Husband review,"The movie was fairly good. However, the quality of the tape could have been better."
1,Movie Title Should Read: Perfect Scott Peterson,"The review made this movie sound really good. Yeah right, (make sure and read the reviews!!!) I found this movie to be only about Scott, his feelings, his life etc.who cares anyway. Not much about Laci, and her life like I thought would be in the movie. I cannot believe how bad this movie was. I was a real Peterson trial junkie, and I knew alot about Scott and Laci and the families, this movie did not portray anyone else just Scott. Really a crappy movie, don't bother buying.I wasted my $18.00, watched it, and promptly threw it away. Didn't want another person throwing their money away like I did."
5,Clampy,"These are really nice products. My only very small quibble is I would have liked to see them one wire gauge heavier, for greater clamping force. The pin-sharp points really dig in and grab."
5,THE ENDS OF THE EARTH-Jason and Diane-SPOILERS,favorite scene with diane-fight they have.favorite scene with jason-talk with whitney.favorite scene together-fight they have.
5,A kids review.,I have 2 and 3 I want to get 1 of the December 25. I wish that they can have 4. It so funny and like it a lot. Give it five.
1,Ham-handed and unnecessary sequel,"The first film embodied everything that is fun about going to the movies. I watched it expecting it to be as good as a film based on a banal theme-park ride could be. On the contrary I was blown away. Clearly the film was self-contained and did not necessitate a sequel, but of course they would make one.Amazingly, the majority of the cast and crew rejoined and that spoke well for the possibilites of the sequel being entertaining. The aim for the filmmakers of this film were not to continue a story with the characters they created, but to make an audience pandering thrill-ride that doesn't allow any pesky plot to get in the way. It was painful to watch them crowbar every single major and minor character from the last film into the new one despite any logic. Apparently afraid the audience would reject the few new characters and ideas, they opted to make the same movie again.I hated this sequel, and I think it detracts heavilly from the original."
4,No HD DVD version,"If I were the same as all the Blu-Ray fanboys, I'd rate this movie 1 star and complain that it's not on HD DVD and say how Sony has Disney in their pocket etc and swear I'll never buy any version of this movie until it comes out on HD DVD and secretly go buy the standard def version and have it packaged in discreet brown packaging.That being said, Dead Man's Chest was not as good as the Curse of the Black Pearl, and only slightly better than the 3rd movie."
1,One Of The Worst Films Ever Made,"I was a big fan of the first film in the series, but the sequels are so bad i can't even enjoy the first one anymore. This has to rank among the worst sequels of all time, right next to Jaws 2."
1,Wow - really bad...!!! Disney really?,"Enough....... all the hype..... really bad...nothing in the way of funny or a real story - and CREEPY!!!! I keep waiting for the funny.... or the story... and the only thing this movie delivers is the question - why did I buy it?!?!?!?! A sad DARK story!!!!!!!!!! Try again...... This one needs a ""do over""!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Slow,"POTCII was a fairly good movie, but it took an excruciatingly long time to get virtually nowhere. We'll see after the last of the trilogy comes out if this one was really worth making."
2,Not as good as the initial movie,Disappointing. I wouldn't have bothered purchasing it if I had already seen it
2,Middle movie,"This is a middle movie. It doesn't stand on it's own, and is merely the filler between the first and third movies. I also didn't like the entire concept of Davy Jones and his crew being composed of sea creatures instead of men--special effects for the sake of special effects. Very disappointing overall."
4,Pirates - Dead Man's Chest,Great fun with wonderful cast. Laughed out loud and screamed at one point. Watched it more than once and will go back to it when in the mood for over the top silliness.
1,God Awful!,The first in the series was a great summer movie. Dead man's Chest is a convoluted mess. The story is hard to follow. The film is at least 1 hr too long.
1,Really Dull,"I love pirates, sailing and maritime stuff. But this movie was just plain boring. The audio is quite poor, making much of the dialog unintelligible. Seeing Johnny Depp swish through scenes was dull before the end of the first 'Pirates', and another couple of hours of it is way too much. This movie again confirms that special effects are no replacement for a good storyline and sincere acting."
4,Dead Man's Chest,"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is one of the best films of the year and is better than the first Pirates. The effects were better, the acting was great, and Elizabeth, William, and Jack were even funnier this time around. I loved all of the new characters and the ending was perfect. There really isn't anything else to say about this film, except that it was astounding. I can't wait for Pirates of the Caribbean: World's End."
2,A waste of time,"Although the current trend is of making trilogies I never could think that someone would make a trilogy of the Pirates of the Carribean series.This second installment is difficult to sit through. It is over two hours and what a boring film. The movie ends in an anti-climax with no treasure in the end. The worst part of the movie is Johnny Depp who seems so idiotic and stupid that will make ""Don Quixote"" an ""Indiana Jones"". With lack-lustre dialogues and lines he is just a waste of time. Overdoing dirty looking pirates and their mannerisms were also nothing impressive. You wonder what the beautiful Keira Knightly is doing in a film as this. There is hardly any role for her here. I liked the way Naomie Harris as the Voodoo Soceress spoke her lines though. There are some good special effects but haven't we seen enough special effects already.Waiting for Part 3? - Don't even care."
3,Good sequel,"We enjoyed the film, but the ending is rather annoying as it leaves you in mid air waiting for the third film. The characters develop well in this film and the special effects are very good. Lots of humour lkie the first one."
3,Greatly Disappointing!,"After seeing the first movie and thoroughly enjoying it I was really looking forward to this second adventure. What I saw was a drawn out movie that went for special effects, way overdrawn scenes and lack of the depth to the characters which was prevelent in the first film. Elizabeth had very little personality and a very small role in the film. Orlando Bloom was good in his portayal as Will and there are a few touching scenes where he is reunited with his ""undead"" father. Johnny Depp was more annoying than funny.Some of the effects were straight out of Disney's 2000 Leagues Under the Sea, though the computer graphics for the Flying Dutchman crew were pretty good.Going in I knew that there is a sequel that is already filmed and it is obvious that the film was drawn out to leave enough story for another go around since these films are highly profitable."
2,Another disappointing spin-off,"The best that can be said about this is that it isn't as bad as 'part 2'! After such a wonderful beginning with 'the curse of the black pearl', it is sad to see how far a film studio can fall just to keep the dollars roling in. The plot is laughable, even if one can understand it, and the characters have had yet another metamorphoisis from the original group we came to love and laugh with. Johnny Depp salvages most of his original genius, but the remainder are pitiful. Even that great actor Geoffrey Rush, seems to wallow in confusion as to what he is supposed to be and do.Please, Disney, do us a favor, and DONT MAKE ANY MORE!!!"
3,Ew,"It was alright. The special effects, the beautiful people, blah blah blah...but for me, Davy Jones' crew was gross. It's probably just me personally but I found them disgusting & I could hardly watch it. Ick."
1,"DULL, for kids, and not fo real ""arg"" pirates","I like Johnny Depp, but this movie did nothing for me.Disney SHOULD HAVE worried about their investment.Lucky there are lots of kids to go see fun entertainment and patents to buy tickets"
2,"As with most sequels, it's lacking","""The first time is always the best"" they say and it seems to apply to serial movies too. Johnny Depp was great in the first movie, but he's over acted this one and even he doesn't seem to be enjoying it. Overall the movie has no plot, no story line and a bunch of special effects, all seemingly created to top the first movie, but it's not worth the $1.99 I spent for a 48 hour rental. I definitely will not bother with the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th. in the series. Yes, Dinsey is going to produce 2 more back to back after the 4th movie. When you get a hit, beat it to death, just like terminator, star treck, etc.The best part of the movie was the undead monkey."
1,arr tis gettin lame now says I,"Avast ye naves, this is war we starts to get stupid in our movie makin...ARRRRR"
3,Beautiful but disappointing,"The sets, makeup, special effects and the Dominica and Bahamas' locations for this movie are great, but the story is the weakest link in the chain, and it brings the whole movie down. The star studded cast can't revive it, and even Johnny Depp poonce prancing through his role as Captain Jack becomes a joke overdone.The DVD extras include a great documentary on the making of Dead Man's Chest. The main challenge the director and producer had to contend with was a tight shooting schedule and the lack of final script. Parts of the movie were being shot before the story was completed. It shows. Hiding this weakness behinds lots of swash and buckle doesn't make it go away. The ""Ask a Ninja"" on-line review is surprisingly spot on.The third (and final?) episode of the Pirates trilogy hopefully will make amends."
1,not full screen,"I purchased this special 2 disc edition since it specifically said ""full screen"". When the item arrived, the back jacket says ""wide screen"". The only reason I went for the special edition was to get the full screen, but it doesn't appear that's what you get. Just a word of caution - you're not getting full screen!"
3,"Good...Not Great, but Good","This was like 3-4 stars. Funny and entertaining. Not Oscar material, but it was fun and worth a look."
3,More Than You May Want To Know,"I eagerly bought this book based on the King in Yellow tales by Chambers I had read years before. Yipes! Chambers wrote a ton of really dreadful stuff--silly, immature nonsense. Despite editor Joshi's disclaimers in the introduction that Chambers wasted a lot of his talent pandering to popularity, I don't think his comments adequately criticized the awfulness of much of this massive volume. Chambers undoubtedly could create real chills, but how the author of the King in Yellow short stories could descend into such pap is beyond me--what a disappointment and what a bore. Unless one is a total fanatic and has to have everything Chambers wrote that has a ""fantastic"" element, save your money and buy a small volume about the Yellow King. The only thing ""fantastic"" about most of these stories is how fantastically dreadful they are."
4,best baby gift,"I get this rocker for all my friend's who are having babies. No doubt, every friend of mine who received it has been so thankful. This rocker is versatile, user friendly, easy to carry around and their babies love it. Once they put the baby in there, the baby is quiet and just enjoys it. It allows the mommies to do housework and get things done around the house, while the baby sits in the rocker and just chills out! Often, the baby just ends up falling asleep!"
3,Good Choice for long term use.,"This isn't the exact one we have, but it is very close. My son has always loved this seat and still likes to try to get in it and rock back and forth!"
4,Great product,"I bought this product because I know babies grow fast. It could be a rocker then be put into a toddler chair. Its has beautiful colors and the designs are cute. My son also likes to fall asleep in it. I wish they toys were a lot better and more pullable, and have more songs then just one."
3,My 7 month old hurt himself in this chair,"I loved this chair until today. My 7 month old (24 lbs) had been strapped in the chair and apparently leaned forward and started screaming. He was face down on tile floor. Luckily, he only ended up with a bruised cheek. I had seen him lean forward before, but never thought he could tip over in this chair. The manufacturer needs to put a warning on the box telling buyers that once your baby is big enough to lean forward to keep the chair in locked still position unless you are next to the baby."
2,Not my thing,"Maybe if you are not into the flashing lights, and the music, this would work great. For me, I would like ot be able to keep my baby occupied while I get a couple of things done, and at this stage (3 months), this still didn't do the trick. She jsut looked at it, expected it to do something when she kicked nothing happened, so boredom set ini. I brought it back. She has a kick and play bouncer... thank heavens. It keeps her busy for up to an hour before she starts fussing. (see my review)"
3,Probably better for older baby/child,"Personally, I think this product will be better for an older baby/child. My daughter is only 9 weeks old, so I'm not 100% sure on this. I bought it when she was just 2-3 weeks old, thinking this is a good buy, which it is, but she never did really warm up to it. The only thing it has is vibration and that would only keep her calm for a few minutes. I finally broke down and bought a swing which she loves, and falls asleep in almost all the time. I think she will like the rocker when she gets older and can sit in and read or whatever."
2,do not rock easily,This thing looked about 18 months old by the time it was one month old and we all know a tiny new one month old is not hard on things. It was on carpet and barely moved plus it did not rock easily at all and was falling apart by the time we returned it. They do NOT make baby things like they used to for my previous babies. Must be the economy...
2,My 5 month old didn't like this,"This chair is eh. My daughter was bored and it seems cheaply made. I love Fisher Price products and we have a ton, but this just didn't work for us."
3,Good for the money,"I needed a rocker to help transition from cosleeping. I put this together and was disappointed in the quality. It seems flimsy and creaked at first which would wake my 3 month old while she was dozing off. It doesnt recline as much as iI hoped, and its annoying when the kick stand is up and i need to move it because the rubber makes it impossible. I don't see us keeping this til toddler years though. You get ehat you pay for. I have the owl version and its really cute."
5,No complaints here!!,"We have been using it from day 1. The rocking is great for a newborn. He's always loved the toys. The monkey (in the older version the toy that played music was a monkey) still plays music 9 months later. My mom has a 2nd one at her house. I have a cousin that is a year older than my son and he loves to sit and rock in this chair. I know it's durable b/c my 9 year old sister will sit in it and it supports her! Now that my son is crawling and pulling himself up, we will sit the chair with the kickstand out so it is stationary in the floor and he will crawl to it and pull himself up using it. The toybar is in his playpen and he still plays with them. It's great to feed him in if we are somewhere without a highchair too! I have no complaints about this product!!!"
5,Great Rocker and Chair,This rocker was a last minute decision and the best one yet. My little one loves the rocking sensation of the chair and the farm animals. It is also very convenient to lay her back and i feel that she is very secure in the seat. We are very happy with the seat .
4,good&#65292; But no reciept,"when I got this item this morning , it did not have a outside box, and i opened it the reciept is missing as well, this delivery is worse than last time.Have not assembled yet but the rocker looks nice"
3,pros and cons,"pros: metal rocker legs rock very well which i great for us parents who type amazon reviews w/ one hand while rocking a baby in said chair w/ other hand, or even w/ a foot!cons: i can see the rocker being too effective once baby is bigger and pitching himself forward as some parents have mentioned. Also, toy bar is clumsy to remove when taking baby in and out of chair or getting out of way when baby prefers to watch the world instead of toys. also, not very portable when taking to grandma's house.verdict: get the other fisher price newborn to toddler rocker chair."
2,"Yes, your child can end up with their face to the ground","When in the rocking position our 6 month-old daughter was able to lean herself far enough forward that the rocker wouldn't tip, but because the fabric wasn't attached to anything but the side rails she would be suspended by the straps with her face almost touching the ground. Very dangerous! I still gave it two stars because it worked great in the reclined position. But because that is all its good for I would just buy a bouncer instead."
3,Kind of wobbly,"I purchased this for my grandson and at almost 4 months, he weighs around 16 lbs. His dad put it together for me and I noticed it was kind of wobbly from side to side. I had him check it and he said it was fine and the one he had at home was the same. I just don't feel very confident that it is going to hold up. So far it has, but I am thinking with his weight, it may not be useful as a toddler and this product claims it goes from infant to toddler."
5,loved it,"My daughter who is 8 months love it she drinks her bottle in it. everything was in perfect new shape and I would deff purchase, she out grew her other one and this one is way better walmart got it for more money and its nice price with free shipping"
5,Love the rocker,"My daughter loves this rocker. We were given a bouncer for my babyshower, but she didn't like being put in the bouncer. She loves to rock in this, she even falls asleep in it and the best part is that if she falls asleep you put up the kick stand and it tilts back for her to sleep comfortable."
3,Needs some modification to earn more stars...,"A very sweet adjunct to the wealth of baby items. Would think this a pleasant addition to grandparents' homes in particular.While the unit is colorful, stable, and can be used as a seat or rocker, there is one issue that could consistently present a problem...Removing baby...the snap off bar, with a catch on each side that must be disengaged, is not easily removed. Mechanism is somewhat awkward. It certainly could disrupt a sleepy baby with the jostling needed, and also requires extra care in manuevering it off while keeping baby stable and happy.A bit of modification could definitely earn this unit another star."
4,Good Overall,"We've found this to be a good item overall. It was easy for me to put together by myself. We use extra links for toys and just use the velcro around the links to attach different toys when our baby gets bored with the existing ones. Sometimes we put the baby near us and use our feet to rock the seat back and forth as it vibrates to set up kind of a swinging motion. At 5+ months our baby likes the toys now more than ever-- for a long time we left the bar off completely because the baby was so disinterested in them. As a newborn the vibration was good for lulling to sleep, but now our baby could take it or leave it, but still enjoys being rocked (by us) and pulling the toys out of the velcro and into the mouth. I'd buy it again. But it isn't the wonder toy (like our swing!)"
3,Depends on the baby,"I bought this item because our 2 month old baby always falls asleep in the car. However, she doesn't fall asleep in the infant rocker and she really doesn't like the idea of being strapped in. I guess it really depends on what kind of baby you have and their likes and dis-likes. Another issue I have is the fact that the toys are not interchangeable. I would love to be able to put some of her favorite toys up to make the experience more enjoyable for her, but it wouldn't work unless I have velcro. I'm sure once she gets older, she will love the idea of having her own rocking chair as most children do, but for the moment, it is not in use."
1,NOT SAFE FOR INFANTS WHO SIT UPRIGHT,"We, too, had an accident with this product. Just today, my 7 month old daughter (21 pounds) flipped the seat forward and landed on her forehead on our hardwood floor. Big egg on forehead above eye. If your infant can sit upright and leans forward -- and is on the heavier side -- it's going to flip.Any product that causes an accident does not deserve more than one star no matter what."
5,Best Buy,"I registered for this for my shower, thinking that it MIGHT be good to have as an extra seat for my new baby. Little did I know just how important a role this item would play in our lives! From day one, my daughter loved the soothing vibrations of the bouncer. At 6 months old, she was fascinated by the overhanging toy arch. My daughter is now 27 months old and she sits in ""her chair"" every single day. She absolutely loves it, and I do too. I love that it is easy to clean, it has maintained its bright colors, and is all around the best shower gift I received over 2 years ago!"
1,Child will smack face on floor if child is able to sit up when chair is not in stationary position,"Why has this item not been recalled?! Any child able to sit up will fall face froward if this chair is not in the stationary position, even buckled in! This is incredibly dangerous! Who is giving this item 4-5 stars and why?! This cannot be unique to my rocker. These people must have reviewed the item prematurely ... before noticing this and they did not bother to update. Omg!"
3,Ok for infant...not so much for toddler,"I have a 15-month old. It was great when she was a newborn. But she too tried to wiggle out of it and the chair came with her unless the kick stand was out. We just took the chair out of storage and put it to the test. As she approaches it to sit in, it moves backwards. It appears that there are not any grips in the specific spots to avoid it moving away from her as she backs into it to sit. I looked through the manual to see if I need to do anything different and there are not any instructions to convert it. If she were taller this may not be an issue. I will save this one for infants only."
4,Great concept!,"I loved the idea of the rocker, but it's rather poorly executed. There isn't much difference between the height settings. The lower setting isn't very reclined, but the higher setting doesn't really allow the child to sit upright. My 1 yr old finds that very frustrating, and won't sit in it. Plus, the product we got is slightly defective. The motor in the vibrations emits a high-pitched whine. My husband took it apart and oiled it, which reduced the whine some, but it's still there."
1,NO BATTERY - WATCH OUT,"Assembly is not easy. It took me a while to make sure - the pieces fit together. Its Asymmetrical design and requires FisherPrice to hire someone who has basic intuitive approach to design. Its few bars with some crappy shaker - which doesnt come with a battery - how outrageous.After all the putting together effort - its useless until I go out and find a battery, buy it and then use it. whats the point of having ordered through amazon.com.beware - pretty flimsy design. I am not going to buy another fisher-price item not even if its fulfilled from amazon.comgo buy something better from brick and mortar stores......"
3,Great Idea - not quite safe,"I bought this for my 10 month old since he has outgrown his bouncey seat. Normally I would bring him in the bathroom to sit while I shower. The first time I put him in this rocker, he nearly tipped over because he was leaning forward while buckled in. Had I not peeked out to check on him when I did, I'm 90% positive that he would have fallen over. Either I'll have to find a way to stop it from tipping forward or just put it away until he's old enough to climb in and out himself."
1,Love to review but BRU irrersponsibly ships..,"Just a word of warning. I ordered this item and today it was left on my door in completley battered condition. While this may sound like a UPS issue, the bottom line is Babies R Us was responsible for preparing the package and said package had no outer boxing, meaning it was pulled from the shelf, a label was stuck on it and it was left to the mercy of UPS. The box had obviously been opened and taped shut, in a very poor manner, at least once. To ship any package in the same form you would pull it off the shelf at a store is pathetically irresponsible and unacceptable. I've arranged for a refund and pick up from UPS to send it back and will just get the item wherever I can find it and put it in the car. I wouldn't third party order anything from Babies R Us again and Amazon (who I've ordered probably hundereds of various items from) was made to look bad by representing them. Shame shame shame."
3,"Like it, don't love it","A newborn is too small to rock themselves in this rocker, so you have to do the rocking if you want them content. The cow broke the first time pulling the cord to hear a moo. Our daughter hasn't used it in a couple of months (stopped at 4 months due to moving and it was packed away). I don't think I'll pull it out and assemble for now based on other reviews. She leans way forward in her swing, car seat, etc. that I'm concerned she too will be face down on the floor with a rocker attached to her in the air. I think most of these manufacturers are just trying to get us to buy items by making them seem like they will work through several stages of the childhood."
5,Very useful for us,"I have twin boy and girl and these seats have been the most used piece of baby furniture second to the cribs. We used it since they were 1 month old for lying around, playing with the toys, napping, eating, drinking milk and more. The only feature we did not use is vibrating motion, which seemed more numbing than soothing to us. One weird thing is for one of the seats, the bar's cow toy is facing the wrong way (outside instead of facing baby), although the other one is just fine. Also the two seats have different fitting bars, so I always have to figure out which bar would fit into which seat, even though they really are supposed to be the same product! Other than that, no toppling over so far (my babies are almost 7 months), and am expecting to use them well into the toddler years. Very good product!"
5,Great chair!,"This is a great chair. Fisher Price has done it again! Our baby has GERD, so she been sleeping in this chair since she was 1 month (as she is still more upright than in a crib and is more spacious than her infant car seat). It's great, since you can have the stand up and use it for an infant. We are now beginning to use it as a rocker and she loves it and the toy bar! My mom has a similar version to this (lighter colors) but it is also part of a swing and you can take the chair out - ""Bunny Smart Stages Swing"" is probably the better buy, since you have three options in one. Both are GREAT and reasonable!!"
3,Where do you get those batteries???,"The chair is not bad in itself. It is pretty basic. The toy bar is simple and I can't say that my son is crazy about the toys that come with the chair.My main grievance is that it uses a random type of battery. I tried and tried and still haven't been able to find such batteries, so that up to this point we still haven't used the vibrating function."
5,Great chair for outside!,"I live in the deep South and needed a seat for my five month old which did not have all the padding and warmth our bouncer seat (My Little Lamb) provided. While we love our bouncer seat, it is too warm for our climate, particularly outside. Our baby loved this chair right out of the box. It is thin but sturdy material. The play toys are interesting and at an appropriate height. They also can be removed. We use this chair outside and it does very well but cannot get wet due to the battery pack at the foot of the chair. Best part, it rocks! Our baby loves to kick and play and rock himself. I highly recommend if you bring your baby outside!"
5,infant to toddler rocker,I bought this for my Granddaughter who at the time was 3 months old. We are doing daycare for her for 6 months and wanted a few things to keep her occupied. she loved this chair from day one and the fact I can convert it to a toddler rocker was great. The Amazon price was very reasonable and it was well worth the money. she is now 5 months old and still loves sitting in it for short periods of time. she also likes playing with the hanging toys. A good buy
4,Wow - Wish I would have known about this,"Our baby (now 4 months) loves to be rocked. He doesn't particularly care for a bouncer or swing but prefers to be rocked. So we lug his car seat in and out of the car so that we can rock him in it. I wish I would have known about this. It seems from all the reviews it would be a waste of money now, he will be sitting up soon."
5,nice chair,"this is a nice, small chair for baby.The colors are awful, typical of this brand.It was easy to assemble, and baby likes to sit here."
5,"Daring, Brave, and a Little Freaky","The author of this novel was definetely brave, writing a book that ALMOST touched upon 'touchy' subjects. I'm not a teen, but my teen days are not far behind me - near enough to remember the sense of separation that can cause one to alienate themselves and ponder the true integrity of society. A tad liberal at times, which is contrary to my own views, I nonetheless recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered ""what is wrong with people?"""
1,DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR,"DONT BUY THIS BOOK. I DONT KNOW WHO THIS KID THINKS HE IS, BUT HE IS A TERRIBLE WRITER. NOT WORTH 10 CENTS. THERE IS NO PLOT. NO VALID THEME. NO METAPHORS. NOTHING BUT A COMPLETE RANT."
1,Possibly the worst book I ever read,No writing skills whatsoever. I found this in an inner city dumpster and tried to read the first few pages. It belongs there.
5,The best soother ever!!!,"I bought this cute little soother for my little boy Ben when he was 6 weeks old. I saw it when I was shopping one day and I just had to have it for him. He absolutely loves it! He is now 17 months old and it has become such a big part of his bedtime and naptime routine. We turn it on first thing when he goes to bed, and when it shuts off, he turns it back on himself. It went with us on vacation last summer to make Ben feel at home. We take it with us to the babysitter's house and to grandma's house. It goes every place Ben spends the night. I don't know what we would do if we didn't have Pooh! I highly recommend this soother to everyone! I have only one complaint about it. It goes through batteries like crazy. I guess it could be from Ben turning it on and off so much! I will definitely give it to someone as a shower gift. Love this toy!!!!!"
3,loved it during its short life,"my 19-month-old son received this toy at birth and basically ignored it until he was about 17 months old. then he became obsessed with it and had to have it with him for all naps and at night, which we were elated about because he was happy to stay in his crib and play with it and eventually fall asleep with no problem. but now the thing won't play! he basically played with it for about 2 months and now pooh's gone mute, and it's not the batteries because i've changed them twice. ours was the spanish version which i can't find anywhere, not even on ebay. my son of course is devasted. guess i'll buy him an english one but i can't believe it didn't last longer and i wonder if the replacement will go bad as quickly. bottom line--this is a great toy, as long as it lasts."
4,Rattle Baby Pooh Rattle,"My daugther has the pooh rattle plush doll and she loves it. It's just a toy and she plays and has fun with it. She likes to look at it and copy what pooh does. We like to call it the Pooh Dance. It's a cute toy I love it. Buy it for your little ones, their babies."
2,not too interested,I purchased this toy when my son was born. At first he just cried at it and now he wants nothing to do with it.
3,1 +1 + 1=3,i buy winnie poo sing to sleep me nono falling asleep so me get mad and me ripp off winne pooo head homies at toyrus no give money back me tape back head and now nono work
1,wish to see pooh before christmas,I WOULD LOVE TO RATE THIS ITEM. BUT I CAN NOT BECAUSE I HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE HERE ON 11/13/02 AND NOW IT IS 11/16/02 AND STILL NO POOH.
2,Sing me AWAKE Pooh!,"I bought this toy hoping it might help my 6-month old fall asleep on his own. I've tried it every night and every nap time for over a month, but it hasn't helped a bit. He does seem mildly interested in playing with it as a toy, but he has never fallen asleep while listening to it. For one thing, the volume is WAY too loud for a soother and there is no volume adjustment. Also, the light bulb is non-replaceable, so eventually you'll lose the lighting feature. Finally, it's not safe to keep anything in your infant's crib due to the risk of SIDS - so what use is the remote control? I do think this is a cute toy- and the music is nice, not annoying like many other infant toys- but it just didn't work for my son. Guess I'm back to singing him to sleep every night myself!"
2,Too loud!,"This toy is really cute but it is too loud and there is no volume control on it. I don't know how it could put any baby to sleep. It is cute though, and it would be great if the volume could be turned down."
5,what a wonderful toy,This toy is the greatest. My son loves his yellow bee...and piglet. I can't recommend this enough.
5,very good electric lantern,I bought this as a replacement for the one I've used camping several times per summer for five years. The switch on my original one gave out. I use this one inside the tent.
3,Not bad for a first time writer.,"I think it's not too bad for a first time writer. I do have problems with the continuity of the events. It is very choppy and confusing. You get the impression that there are pages missing between pages. I did however enjoy the plot and the dialogues, and the characters are likeable, although i'm sure they would have found out who the real killer is in the middle of the book. All they had to do is ask Bianca's brother who asked him to commission the dagger. But, this is her first book and i've read worse books from other experienced writers. That's why I gave it 3 stars. There's still room for improvement."
1,Didn't like it enough to finish it.....,"A very strange, disappointing debut. The plot had potential but the writing style was gawky and awkward. The hero and heroine were totally incompatible, plus the fast-moving plot was too complicated to keep track of. Lots and lots of secondary characters to sort out and a see-through mystery plot. Try again, Michele: this just didn't make it."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"This is one of the worst written novels out there. The characters are unbelievably 1 dimensional, the plot is so cliche, and the story is implausible to say the least. I bought it for $2 on clearance and now I know why it was in the clearance bin. Its not even worth the $2 I paid for it. Its an utter waste of time and trees."
1,Not Good!!!!,"Bought it because it was really cheap, but when I got the product I am very disappointed. First of all, it says see the item for country of origin, and when I opened the box, the filter wasn't even in a plastic wrap or anything...and of course, there is nothing beside that filter inside the box. Then when you compare the filter to the pic on the box, it is not right as well, supposedly the pic on the box shows a black plastic casing around the white filter, NO, i didn't see anything like that, the filter is just one piece of cotton, the sides have mesh on them but no casing at all!!! Then I tried to fit it to my old volvo and not sure if my air intake casing warped or this is the wrong spec, but when i inserted this i had to use duct tape to tape both ends so no small openings would appear!!Bottom Line: IF I DIDN'T LIVE IN CANADA AND IT'S A HASSEL TO RETURN THIS, I WOULD!! I PROBABLY GO BACK TO DEALERSHIP AND GET IT CHANGED DURING NEXT SERVICE. Waste of money."
4,A good example of life,The book is an autobiography and it shows how the entrepeneour soul has been formed from childhood and through the years he improve his skills looking for new oportunitiesThis is a good book for learn its teachings from one of the best visionaries of our era
3,the virgin story,"great book!lovely in-flight reading. makes you aware of the possibilities in life and encourages/convinces you to take the entrepreneurial route. i wanted to rate it 4 or 5 stars but amazon doesnt allow me to change it. However, amazon ""does"" allow me to change the text of the review. weird.A very detailed account of an average-intelligence, highly successful entrepreneur who did not go to college. Not like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg who dropped out. Branson skipped it entirely!Proves the point that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to make a significant positive impact on the world. Plus its more fun to read than Michael Dell's biography."
4,Tresures in the Dust,"I just got done reading the book ""Tresures in the Dust"". I t was an exceptionally good book. I myself didn't care for it that much because I like books about mysteries, adventures, and alot more. This book is about two bestfriends named Annie and Violet who are living during the time of the Dust Bowl. Annie dreams of becoming an archaeologist and Violet dreams of becoming a dancer. Their families are going through really hard times and eventually after Violet's Aunt Miriacle dies her family has to move west to fond jobs. Annie and Violet are devestated. I would recommend this book for someone who is interested in boks about American history."
5,Don Francisco's One Heart at a Time,I was very pleased by getting the item I ordered in a veryshort period of time and that the product was a very goodquality item. I wouldn't hesitate to order again.
5,The Guaymas Chronicles,"This book will always be one of my favorites. It is not only a great biography of life in Mexico 50 years ago, it is a remarkable human story of the author, anthropologist David Stuart, his life in Guaymas, Sonora in the late 60's and early 70's, and the events that forever changed it. You can't read the book without your own heart being indelibly etched."
3,strange (but fun) little game,"Chances are, if you liked (or still like) Tetris, then you will enjoy Hot Potato on the Gameboy Advance. The storyline is unique to say the least, the action/gameplay is fast-paced, and the graphics are pretty good. Also, the game becomes very challenging as you advance through the levels.The controls work well on the GBA, and it is my guess that most gamers will have them down in just a few games, if not sooner.This game is basically a puzzle game with quite a bit of action, in the sense that you are actually ""shooting"" potatos up the screen. Like I said, this game is out of left field.Strange, but definitely fun. Now that the retail has dropped quite a bit on this title I would pick it up."
4,FIRST BLOOD END OF AN ERA MATCH,"THE FINAL CHAPTER IN THE AUSTIN MACMAHON RIVALRY WAS SPECTACULAR, THIS IS A MUST SEE VIDEO,BUY IT RIGHT NOW OR YOU'LL BE SORRY"
5,The WWF was Fully Loaded in 1999,"Great event love this video.My favorite matches were,Jeff Jarrett vs Edge for the IC title ,Big Show vs Kane, Xpac and Road Dogg vs Billy Gunn and Chyna, HHH vs The Rock in a strap match, and The Undertaker vs Stone Cold for the championship in a first blood match."
4,Convincing Case for the Congress to reassert it's Perogative,"I read this book for a course on the US Congress. Louis Fisher paints a picture of a Congress that has lost it's will to fight the president for it's war and spending powers which are explicitly given to it in the Constitution. The book shows that up until President Truman, Congress had exclusive control over these powers. The president grabbed more power during war time, but then power went back to Congress in peace. Fisher Argues that since Truman congress has given up these power, or abdicated them, and no longer trusts itself to conduct the nations business."
5,Great gas can - no leaks. Great service from the seller,"I already have one of these cans and use it to fill my Waverunners. No drips or leaks around the spout, unlike almost every other 5 gal can I have used. This particular can is difficult to find locally. Service from the 3rd party seller here (Uncle Joe's) was excellent, lightning fast shipping and even a personal e-mail from the owner. To be honest, I was worried at first - hadn't heard of them - but based on this experience, I would definitely purchase from them again."
1,Boring,"My appologies in advanced for all the Harry Potter fans. With the exception of the first movie, I found this series boring and irritating. Maybe the books are better. Not my bag of worms."
4,Great movie series!,I love the Harry Potter series and Blu Ray is the way to go! I didn't like that the movies were in different sized cases. As long as they stay in the box though you'll never be the wiser. The bookmarks that come with are so cool. They're not cheep plastic or cheesy at all. I can't wait for the last 3 movies!
3,"Overall Okay, but with 2 cracked cases","The DVDs arrived and were correct, which seems to be an improvement from before when the special features disc replaced The Order of the Phoenix. Overall, I'm content with my order. The only problem was that 2 of the cases were cracked on the bottom, which was a bit irritating, but the DVDs weren't damaged."
3,Year 5 Disc Missing! Received Special Features disc instead.,"The 5 disc set is a great price with fine quality, bare bones movie only with no perks, so it would seem.Watch out for the year 5 disc. It is missing and in its place was the special features disc for year 5.Luckily we had bought the year 5 disc a couple weeks earlier seeing it was on sale and at that point did not purchase the 5 disc set yet. We decided to keep the set becuase of this bit of luck."
1,Watch out - check these immediately! 4 out of 5 won't play at all!,"I purchased this set in December 2009 to have on hand, but did not watch them immediately. This week, in anticipation of the final film's release, we wanted to go back and watch all the previous ones at leisure. ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was fine, enjoyed it. The next night, we popped in ""Chamber of Secrets"". Locks up just starting to play. We messed with it for a while, checked on possible software updates to the player, etc. Finally watched the DVD version which I also had. To make a long story short, four of the five disks will not play. The newest player (LG 3D model) does nothing at all. An older Magnavox BD player just tells me that playback may not be enabled for this disk (!?!?!). So I'm waaaay out of the return window on this set."
4,HD Potter,"I would really like all the special features to be in HD. The feature films in HD are awesome and worth the price, but when U pay for HD it's fair that special features look awesome as well."
5,wife loved it!!!,"Excellent product and value. Bought for my wife and she loved it, nothing more need be said."
2,Missing Blu-ray case and disc,"I adored the movies and have been looking to buy the first five in bluray format for a decent price. So I was really upset when I received my set yesterday and there were only four cases in the box. The Sorcerer's Stone case and disc was missing from the set. I bought the set from vendor NorAm International Partners, Inc. and fulfilled by Amazon. I ended up sending it back today for a refund."
1,Same story - mispackaged,"I ordered this set on January 6th, before most of the other reviews had been posted, and I had the same problem as many others - my disc 5 was the Special Features disc instead of the actual Order of the Phoenix movie. I wanted to exchange it (hoping that the problem had been corrected since so many complaints had been lodged), but the automated email that I just received from the Amazon returns department said that it's no longer available. Very disappointing."
1,Potter pkg,Not happy one of the cd's was not as advertised and was not replaceable. Money was refunded on a timely basis but would rather have had the set.
3,Great gift for younger children,"I purchased this for my 8 year old who is crazy about all things Harry Potter. Overall, this is a great gift for kids who don't particularly care about the video quality. The pictures are grainy. Also, be advised - the first DVD is titled ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"". We told him this was what they called a ""sorcerer"" in England.I would recommend giving this to young kids but not for adult enthusiasts. An adult will be dissapointed with the quality of the video."
1,A Review for Video,It was kind ave lame and Stupid and I diidn't like it but I've seen all of the Harry Potter Movies!
3,Movies are great but.....,"My husband bought this set for me from a local store and not Amazon. I noticed that the box set contains all five movies but not the second special features discs. This is particulary bad if you want to do the extras like explore Hogwarts and be a student. On the first disc (The Sorceror's Stone)the DVD menu allows you to click on Hedwig flying over top of Hogwarts. The next screen says you are officially accepted to Hogwarts only to hear an announcer say to ""please insert disc 2."" Well there is no disc two. If they are going to offer this box set not as special editions, then they need to make sure the DVD menus and things are updated appropriately to be the standard edition only. That seems pretty cheap for Warner Brothers to offer the movie in so many various ways and editions but keep each DVD with the same menu options and only add or subtract the extra discs into each case."
5,Pleasantly suprised (5th movie included!),"I have been wanting to purchase this 5-disc set for a while now, but have been hesitant due to the reviews stating that the fifth movie is in fact not the actual movie, but instead a special features disc. Just last week I went back to the reviews and noticed a few people have said that Amazon has fixed the problem, so I thought I would take my chances. As soon as the package arrived today, I opened it and put in the fifth disc to see if the movie was there . . . And it was! I'm a big fan of Amazon, they have never let me down. I will continue to buy from Amazon."
3,Harry Potter 5 Year Box Set,"It's nice saving room and having all the Harry Potter books in one package. However, there are NO special features with these DVDs. You are only buying the movies."
3,short to short,i was exspection a lot more out of this then i got there should have been a lot more then there was
3,Non-matching DVD sleeves in the trunk. Very odd!,"First off, there's plenty of box, or trunk space, in the set. They clearly left enough room for movies 6 and 7, especially since there's about an inch inside the trunk which is just cardboard fluffer. So can anyone explain why on earth, movies 1 and 2 come in CD size sleeves, and movies 3, 4, and 5 come in regular dvd size sleeves which fit nice and snug inside the case. The smaller sleeves for movie 1 and 2 are just free-floating inside the trunk and bound to get rattled around in carrying the trunk. This just defies reason. Obviously this review has nothing to do with the movies themselves, but the packaging is fair game especially on a ""Limited Edition Gift Set""."
3,Any screw-ups w/ the Blu-Ray set?,"Folks, I'm awaiting delivery on the Blu-Ray set of this collection and am concerned about one thing: reports are that Warner Bros. inadvertently included the 4th movie, Goblet of Fire, as an HD DVD and not a Blu-Ray DVD. Therefore, of the 5 movies in this set, DVDs 1-3 and 5 are, indeed, Blu-Ray, but DVD #4 is HD DVD, obviously incompatible for those with solely a Blu-Ray player. Worse, the same reports state that Warner Bros. has not decided to do anything replacement-wise on this, leaving customers in the dark for now.Has anyone who ordered this set in Blu-Ray experienced this, or are all 5 DVDs in fact, Blu-Ray discs?"
1,misleading,i thought that this actually was harry potter years one through 5. this is not what i wanted so i deleted it off of my kindle fire as soon as i was able to.
2,trunk is very small,i got this usedand gosh was expecting a much bigger trunkagain this trunk is very smallagain no wonder everything is spread out in the photobut wb has put two trunks in the photoi only paid 24 or so for itbut goshif you are wanting collectors itembe forwarnedthe trunk is smalland doenst even hava a handle to carry
1,patience is rewarded,"As others also said, i will wait for the FINAL, ULTIMATE HARRY POTTER LIMITED EDITION MEGA BOX SET which will have all 7 movies + unlimited extras in a 14 mega dvd box set (or more...).All other box sets are useless including this one and the next one which will have the half blood prince movie. plain & simple."
1,Pure Junk,"The ""trunk"" is cheap cardboard and the movies don't play in most dvd players.I hate that WB puts out junk like this."
5,Ecstatic!!!,"Harry Potter Years 1-5 Limited Edition Gift SetI was so happy to get this!!! This was a christmas present to myself. I was concerned on the quality after hearing complaints regarding the book set...the fact that it was cardboard & all...Mine was as well, but it's hard, laminated & just as sturdy as, say, a jewelry box. The extras are beautiful...and I especially appreciated the package design of the dvd cases...lovely..."
1,Do Not Buy This!,"I ordered this set because it included all the movies for a cheap price. However, when I opened the cases for the movies, I found that in place of movie 5 was the special features disk instead. I paid for ALL five movies, but I didn't receive what I ordered.I am very frustrated with amazon and will not buy from them in the future if I can help it. It is not acceptable to send the wrong disk; it is deceitful. I don't know how they think that this is acceptable. Many other complaints about this problem have been voiced, yet nothing has been done."
3,Goblet of Fire Error,"So, my family and I have had this product for a while, randomly rewatching movies out of order. Nothing really seemed out of place until yesterday. I had just finished rereading the Goblet of Fire and had the urge to watch the movie. I guess that within the 2-3 years of owning the box set, we hadn't watched Goblet of Fire (which, in itself, is odd) because I was shocked when our Blu-ray player wouldn't play the movie. I double check the disk, and it was an HD disk, NOT Blu-ray. Thinking that we had unknowingly had only HD disks the whole time (which I was skeptical of because I had never had any problems watching the other movies) we hadchecked all the other disks.The rest were Blu-ray. So now I'm annoyed and can't watch my Goblet of Fire... :(Other then that, however, this is the most abdorable box set I have ever seen. If that GoF disk had been Blu-ray as well, I would have given this 5 stars."
1,Missing Fifth Movie,"I also got the boxed set with the Special Features disc instead of Disc 5 - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The disc sleeve is for the movie, but the disc inside is wrong. This is a manufacturer error and not a problem with the product listing. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a postage paid return shipping label and will refund my money.One star for the quality of the product, but five stars for Amazon's response."
4,Listenable and enjoyable - nothing more,"When I heard that Peter Green (from Fleetwood Mac) is featured on this album, I didn't hesitate to buy it. And though I wasn't disappointed, I found myself comparing it to Green's collaboration with Otis Spann. In this way, it pales in comparison. Green's playing with Spann is some of his absolute best. It's controlled and expressive and fluid and exciting. And though his playing with Eddie Boyd is certainly tasteful, I found it to be rather unremarkable. Sure, it's restrained and even and his tone is pleasant, but it lacks the sting and grit for which he became lauded. A mild recommendation."
2,4 gamers that like hard games!,my friend likes because its spider-man 2 but i kind of like but its nothing close to the movie. Theres this part with a rino and you run and run but in the movie where in the world is a rino? but the game is more cartoon like. it good for people who like a BIG game thats super hard... still stuck i the robbery level darn bad guys.... TIP: get down on you legs and swat the bad on the legs.... GOOD LUCK
1,Awful,They have a terrible odor and are impossible to remove from the box without tearing. Beyond flimsy. Buy the Seventh Generation wipes instead.
3,As good as could be expected for the price,"Only issue is the amount it sheds. Would make a great quilt if it was covered. And it wants 4 more words in this review, but I already said all I needed."
3,Not recommended for the serious survival kit,Very thin and has a chemical odor even after washing. The fabric is not very soft and insulation value is much less than my fleece blanket. In other words I would not recommend this blanket for survival or emergency purposes especially for the price. There is much better gear out there.
4,Dead Deliver in Classic Late-Period Show,"I'm no Dead-at-all-costs fanatic, though I appreciate the band, Jerry's evident musicianship, and have a dozen or so live releases, most of the studio albums, and a bunch of the excellent reissue series of Jerry's solo live and studio work.This is definitely one of the best live shows of the latter period. Jerry's voice and guitar are in fine, efficient (for Jerry) form, the band is energetic and lively, the set list interesting. I agree with the reviewer who noted the rythmic and harmonic sophistication of Phil Lesh's bass on this gig -- just listen to him on ""Terrapin Station"" or the beautiful ""Ship of Fools.""Although Dead fans have heard ""Row Jimmy Row"" many times and in many different settings, I found this one particularly poignant and touching, coming as it does on the 4th of July and near the end of the long strange trip this amazing American musical, cultural, and spiritual force took us on."
5,Kurtz is the man.,"Okay so I am a fan of the Joe Kurtz books, I wish more than three where written. Solid writting, good depth of people that make this book so great."
5,easy to use,"there was a mix up in the quantity they shipped, what I ordered and what was listed but generally it is so much easier to use these ratchet binders than the other kind, they do take a little longer to tighten but its better and safer."
2,Bad 'B' movie,"I saw B movies that they were really nice. great story line, average acting, nice music etc. Now, this movie was something else. It was done in Japanese censure tradition, if you know what I mean. And it was not even art style either, you know, how main stream movie show but not show. This one did not even try. Filming was done in very weird angles and it was almost like 70's T&A movie without the A. Bottom line, you would be wasting your money on this movie."
5,Collectors own this book for good reason,Old Friends is a classic collection of meaningful images capturing the golden years of the world's great thoroughbreds. Livingston's work has become a valuable holding. A wonderful book for the serious collector.
4,Great read,"Ever since I read Hyperion, I've regarded Mr. Simmon's work as outstanding, and continue to follow his works. This is a great collection of short stories that are satisfying to read."
3,that editorial review,"Obviously ""kirkus"" translates to incompetent moron. I have never witnessed a more inept, bungling, and egocentric review as the editorial review above. Obviously this writer is an authority on religion. Perhaps he/she could enlighten us all with the actual origin of life. Religion is based on interpretation, and those that criticize others only display there own insecurities and arrogance. Kerouac is best experienced when read or viewed with an open mind. His sense of freedom and spontaneity are felt in his words and his life. He is one of the most widely read and profoundly influential writers in the American canon. While it is an assumption, the aforementioned critic is not such a celebrated writer, and his review gives too much credit to himself, and it gives too little to Jack Kerouac. {I just felt the need to defend Kerouac from opinionated, insubstantial, religious criticism}"
3,Hope People Are Ready For This. . .,"O boy, what a novel to review -- or is this a novel? Actually it's not. It's a collection of random notes on Zen Buddhism, and some sections made its way to other books (i.e. Dharma Bums). This was claimed to be a Kerouac novel the editors refused to publish; and I can see why --""It's Ahead of its time."" I recommend approaching this book (?) not with the objective of reading it front to back, but instead back to front or front to middle -- you get the picture. However, those approaching it as a novel will not understand it; it's typically a coffee table book."
2,"Another ""Len's Cap"" Error","The camcorder was great for a couple of months, and then, the dreaded ""Lens Cap"" error. Now it is useless. Fortunately, I bought the extended warranty from Sams, where I bought the camera. Now I'm waiting to see how that works out. Either way, unfortunately, the camera clearly isn't well made or reliable. Once fixed, I'll use it when convenient -- until I find a new one that is equally good and made by a more reliable manufacturer."
2,boring,"I was excited to read this book for a number of reasons. Murdoch's reputation as a wonderful writer and the brief but interesting synopsis among them. This book was definitely among the worst I have read in a long time. I kept waiting for it to get better, no such luck. It seemed as if Murdoch tried to go to great lengths to develop her characters, to give them depth, but most felt (with maybe the exception of Peter) so self absorbed and shallow that you couldn't really ""feel"" for them. Save yourself the disappointment."
1,tushies diapers do not work,"I made the mistake of buying these for my grandson, BIG mistake. My daughter says that every single time my grandson has a dirty diaper, it pours out the sides & ruins everything it touches. She would send them back if she could. These diapers do not absorb and are definitely NOT leak-proof. It gets one star only because I had to at least click one...."
5,I Love These Diapers!,"These diapers are great. Yes they have the sticky tabs, but I'd rather struggle occasionally (four times in 10 months) than use diapers with harsh chemicals. They have good absorbancy and are a great alternative to cloth diapers, especially in the summer (my son got too hot in cloth in the summer)."
2,Not Great,Radio only gets one station and only sporadically. Very sensitive. Registers more steps than you actually take.
5,You can't go wrong with this tile saw.,"I spent years using a very cheap 4"" tile saw, so buying this was a major step up, to say the least. After carefully reading reviews on many different brands and price ranges I decided to take the plunge on the DeWalt D24000. For the money, I don't think I could have done better. What a difference it is using this baby compared to the cheap model. From my research, the mid-range $300-$400 saws were not good values for the money, and I've learned over the years with tools that you get what you pay for. Pay the extra money and get this saw, it's well worth it!"
5,Excellent Tile Saw,"I purchased a ""cheapy"" tile saw last year and have been kicking my self ever since. This saw makes perfect, beautiful cuts every time. My only problem with it is having to clean it after the job is done. There are to many small places that fill up with cuttings..GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!"
5,Flex gas hose and kit...,"Exactly as pictured upon arrival and installation.... Simple, functional, yet not elegant... A shorter hose could be used in some cases, codes depending.... Shutoff valve worked smoothly and choice of adapters for fitting aided in less shopping...."
1,Even though a Mr. Heater product doesn't work with Mr Heater 20000 BTU Heater,Does not give the fitting sizes in the description. Sent E-mail to Mr. Heater to ask about sizes they ignored the E-mail. Would not buy this product because of the lack of information in advertisement.
2,Difficulty Epitomised,This book is anything but impressive. Not a tome for the beginner.Is nothing more than an explanation of the history of I Ching. No new interpretation of the symbolism of this ancient oracle can be gleaned from this text.Better look elsewhere for guidance and understanding
3,"Decent, but Expensive & Heavy Lavender Scent","This is an ok face cream, light & non-greasy, but it's not my top choice. I'm not a big fan of lavender (so I found out) and this was just too scented for my face. The smell did seem to lessen a little as the jar was opened more or I could have just been getting used to it. BWC face cream ingredients are rated a 3-MOD hazard on the cosmetic safety database. There are a few organic ingredients, but why the Benzyl Alcohol? The price on this is a little high too. I can't find it for less than $10 for 2oz. Overall it's not terrible, but I won't buy again. I've been using my fragrance free body lotion,Nature's Gate - Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion, 18 fl oz lotionas a face cream too & it works out well. And I can get a 32oz pump bottle of it for the same price as 2oz of BWC face cream. Plus it has a 2-LOW risk score rather than a 3-MOD risk."
3,Not a must have item,I am in the process of reviewing all my baby items! If you are trying to save money this is not a must have item. We have three daughters and neither of my last two liked this swing compared to the regular swing. I think it is great for people who live in a small space or travel ALOT in first few months of life! We are at home most of the time.
3,Too fast for newborns even on lowest speed,"We purchased this swing for our 2nd son. So far, we have not been able to use it because even on the lowest setting it is WAY too fast! The first time we put our son in it, we thought he was going to throw up from the speed. We have to manually push the swing when we use it.We think this is a major design defect as our son was not born premature or at a low weight. We would not recommend this swing."
3,Cute & popular but my son got bored QUICK!,"My son did not like this swing after about a week. He got real bored being so close to the ground. It was also VERY DIFFICULT to get him out of the swing. Would almost hit his head every time. He never liked the fish.........likes his aquarium bouncy seat much better. I never did figure out how to fold this swing. Spend your money on the bouncy seat if you must have an aquarium piece. Larger, old fashion swing worked better for us. With reclining seat and a higher view, my baby is much happier."
3,reconsider if you have a pet,"We received this swing as a gift. I was so nervous about it being low to the ground and our dog having access to baby, that I'd post myself in front of the swing while baby was in it. As a result, we did not use it much. Also bending clear to the ground to get baby in and out was a pain."
1,Junk,"We used this product one day and the motor broke. By looking at it, I thought it would last at least a week or two.Our baby girl just loved it too. What a disappointment!!"
2,Not happy with Design,"Would not recommend this swing. Sure, portability is nice but so is ease of use and safety. Everytime I try to place or remove my son from the swing, I hit his head on the bar. Also, placing him in the swing can be a challenge since it is not steady...if he is fussy and kicking, that makes it all the more difficult to safely place him in the seat. Also, he doesn't like the swing...maybe it is my frustration....who knows. I wish I would have kept the box because I would be returning it! My neighbor also bought one and she is having problems too. Her son has flopped out (even strapped) of it on more than one occasion. Once they are big enough to grab the upper bar...forget about using it."
4,awesome follow-up to an excellent first album,"if you like Zeppelin,you'll love Zebra.This second album is awesome,as any true fan of Zebra will tell you.Randy Jackson's vocals are incredible,as are Felix Hannemans' harmonies as well as bass and keyboards.Guy Gelso is Neil Peart like on drums.Absolutely and incredible album"
4,Actually captures the good (and silly) of gaming!,"I can't say that it's a brilliant film or anything, but as a gamer myself, I found a lot to like and laugh at. The thing that I liked best was that a person who had little or no experience with D&D, or RPGs in general, might watch this movie and come away from it thinking that gaming was a legitimate hobby with creative and artistic validity. The gamers tend to be silly, and perhaps even sad as people, but in a more realistic and positive fashion than the characters in similar movies. After watching movies like ""Gamers,"" which made people who play D&D look pretty lame and pathetic, this movie was a pleasant and very funny surprise."
1,Bummer,"my daughter bought this and the sound was great, easy to use and she loved it. two weeks later the sound just quit. returned it to the factory for a new one, it quit too. would not buy another."
2,it's not really about China,"This tells you more about the author than it does about China; the writer claims to know Chinese but commits some obvious howlers (""horse-horse camel-camel"" for ""ma-ma hu-hu"") that shows she speaks very little. Much better books about China include Kristoff & WuDunn's China Wakes, the Tysons' Chinese Awakenings: Life Stories from the Unofficial China, or Jan Wong's Red China Blues : My Long March from Mao to Now."
3,Decent game,"This game is pretty difficult, there are no cheats if you need help, or any trainers that I could find that worked. You can pick a couple different paths from the beginning of the game, good or evil, different clans depending on whether you slaughter or help some villagers being attacked in the first mission. It takes a different approach to training, you take peasants and send them into buildings to get skills and then those troops can go into other buildings to train into more advanced soldiers. You only get so many peasents at a time, they build slowly automatically. You harvest water, and rice to build troops."
3,"Lots of fun the first hour or so, much less after that","I used to think these games were all about charisma...just make some interesting-looking units with silly voices, and you have a winning formula. Turns out I was wrong.The graphics, sound, and charisma of this game are all top-notch. They also made a strong effort to make a game with some real differences from the traditional starcraft formula. Unfortunately, every change was for the worse. I don't like the continuous peasant-creation system, the multiple training sites that make it possible to make the ultimate all-purpose unit, or the ""yin/yang"" concept that requires you to fight to get upgrades. It also doesn't really allow you to give group orders like you could in starcraft, (e.g. stimpack a whole group of marines at once), a major problem.Bottom line, it looks great, but just isn't fun anymore after the first few games. I'll wait for Warcraft III."
2,Original game with good graphics...that's it,"I bought this game, played it for a night, and returned it to get Ghost Recon (which happened to ROCK).Pros:-It's playable out of the box. I used to not care about this so much, but now I don't expect every game to work right away. How tragic.-The graphics are excellent. I was very impressed.-The game is very original. Resources like water and rice that grows make the game more interesting. The unit alchemy is a very new concept. Horses are really cool in the game.Cons:-All in all, the game wasn't all the fun after a while. I just went back to playing Civ 3 and Dark Age of Camelot.-The battles, though they look cool, are not fun to fight.-The resource cap is VERY annoying.-The unit alchemy system means that making all of your peasants into the top unit is really all you need to do to dominate. There is no reason to diversify your troops."
1,Save yourself the heartache of lost or inacessible data,"I think that imation 2HD IBM diskettes are the WORST storage devices on the planet! A couple of other schoolmates and I were attracted by these colorful diskettes and we have come to realize that they are not durable. If you want to protect the integrity of your term papers and projects or have access to them, please do not use preformatted imation 2HD IBM diskettes, as you will be very disappointed. Moreover, you know what? Their customer support is so unprofessional ...I called them about the diskettes and they were rude. Oh! I am so upset that they position themselves as the best and actually have such terrible equipment out there...I hope that students will stop wasting their money on these diskettes.Disappointed end user"
5,Great book,"Helps the Christian to know just who he/she is dealing with. Great for church leadership. Also, for checking ourselves for any of these."
1,Wow -- Hope I Lost This DVD In My Storage Cabinet,"I was completely broad sided when I watched this movie, I had no idea that it was going to be this bad. I have well over 200 Blu Ray DVD's and believe me, I am going to make sure its hidden somewhere in my DVD Cabinet.Funny thing is, I would have to be stoned drunk to even consider watching Way Of War again, has to be in the top five of the worst movies I have, and yes, you can you guess I wouldn't recommend ANYONE purchasing it."
4,Good show for those who get it,I thought this movie was good. I like the way story was told. I didn't have a problem following the story with all the flash backing because of the color and look of the different times. I can understand how this film could be dissapointing and confusing for some people. The cover and the trailer might give the impression that it's an action movie but it's really not. Some of the story line is not obvious. The production at certain scenes does appear cheap but every film has flaws so one gets used to overlooking them to enjoy the show. This show is worth a watch but pay attention to get the story.
1,Folding helping hand,"Dont waste your money on this product. I received this product, opened envelope yes an envelope and took tried product. Nothing. The handle moved but the area that picks up did not. Straight into the garbage it went. Don't buy!!!!"
5,helping hand,Very helpful and very easy to use. Handle fits great in the hands. Someone does not have to disabled to use these. They work for anyone.
1,don't waste your money on these grabbers...,"I bought these grabbers because they looked like the Gopher Grabber by Ontel that I bought in Walgreens Drugstore. The Gopher Grabber is the best... easy to grip and the business end (the grabber part) is made of rubber which is flexible and pliable and can pick up pieces of flat paper off the floor. The gripper pictured here have grabbers that are made of hard plastic and can't ""grip"" anything. They are frustrating to use because whatever you are trying to grab keeps slipping out... save your money and the the Ontel version."
4,Folding long reach handle,I never thought I would ever need a product like this but this thing is as handy as a pocket on a shirt. While I was in a wheelchair and then using a walker for about a month this thing came in so handy so many times.
3,You get what you pay for.,This is made of light materials which is good but it is only good to pick up paper weight objects off the ground and really need to press the lever hard to hold the objects other than paper.
1,It was a piece of junk!,It was a big piece of Junk! It doesn't work and it isn't worth the postage to send it back.
2,Helping hand that doesn't help much,"I had a Gripper before but lost it one day when I went shopping. Purchased this particular one online but was disappointed because the joint in the middle does not lock tight when you straighten it. I use it when I go shopping but can not trust it to grab anything heavy, like a can. Perhaps I just got a bad gripper. Good luck."
3,works okay after fix,"This product came apart after a couple of minutes of use.After we taped it with package tape so that it won't fold any more, it works very well to pick up not too heavy of objects."
3,Awesome but...,"Why do they have the song ""Poor Cow"" on here? That is by far the WORST Sham 69 song. If they had replaced that with Ulster Boys, I would give this 4 stars."
1,Avoid this MP3 player,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday. It does not work out of the box, it powers on for 2 seconds and then powers off. We tried multiple new batteries, it's just broke as is. It does work as a USB drive, it just does not play mp3's.Save your money or spend more for something of higher quality."
2,Not the version I expected,"Yes...I got it at a ridiculously low price...and yes it arrived on time as promised...but it was an older revision than the one pictured.It worked for what I needed it for, and from what I could see there were not many if any changes in the new addition other than the cover. I would have paid a few more dollars to assure that I got the edition I was required to have."
3,gargantuan binoculars,"These binoculars are heavy and can only be considered useful when mounted to a tripod, which I already had. The optics on my pair do not seem that clear as some of the other types of binoculars that I own. I have had some difficulty trying to get good focus, but keeping them steady is quite a trick especially since the focus wheel does not turn with ease. I originally thought they would be good for casual star gazing but I think a telescope might be better."
4,Good knife for the price,"This is a good boning knife. Blade isn't too thin and flimsy(some people like it really flexible, not me though) Blade will keep sgarp for a pretty long time if cared for properly. If it get's dull I have no qualms with grinding the hell out of it to get it sharp again, since it was so cheap. I really wanted a Wusthof boning knife but didn't want to shell out the $75.00. I recommend a ""Bladesafe"" blade cover to keep your knives safely contained when not in use."
5,Piano Magic of Floyd Cramer,Wonderful Floyd Cramer. He is so talented and we lost him way too soon. Being self taught on the piano makes him even more special.
3,Entertaining and yet...,"This wasn't one of Anthony's better Xanth novels and while I liked the way Irene handled herself I don't particularly like the way Anthony tends to depict women. He may be sexest but the book was good enough to get over that and enyoy the charecters. I really liked the ogre who was delightfully stupid and the centaurs who were (usualy) painfully smart. And, no offense intended to the author, but couldn't he cut out just a tad of the smutty jokes and sexual inuendo so some if the younger reader's mothers, such as mine, will have less reasons to complain about their kids reading it? But if you don't mind that doen't let this review keep you from reading it.-Elia"
4,"Great recipes, wonderful pictures!","I bought this a few years ago and have cooked many of it's recipes since then. The ""Casseroled Venison w/Stout"" has been a particular favorite. The book is also available in a large paperback format with a slightly different title, ""Irish Food And Cooking"", and different cover."
3,too heavy,"Great looking, but was a bit heavy for my little one to get up and down the streets we live on. No regrets, its all metal with a few plastic parts, but way to heavy to keep up with the adults on the trails."
3,Pots and Pans,"Ordered this for a temporary second home.. Would rather there had been a third larger saucepan and lids for the saute and large frying pan.. Easy to clean and work, mostly, for purpose intended.. I will be looking for a 3rd pan."
4,good deal,"they are bit heavy, but sturdy. stain is hard to get off after cooking, have to scrub hard. looks pretty."
5,Featuring the recorded sounds of 110 of Wisconsin's birds,"Now in an expanded second edition, Birds Of Wisconsin: Field Guide by naturalist and wildlife photographer Stan Tekiela is significantly enhanced with updated photos, information, and range maps. This easy-to-use guide is specialized and restricted to 111 common species focused upon Wisconsin birds and Wisconsin range maps. Superbly organized by a color coding approach (see a yellow bird, then go to the yellow section to find out what it is), especially helpful in trying to distinguish between similar appearing birds, hallmarked with gorgeous bird photography, and laced with Wisconsin aviary tidbits and facts, Birds Of Wisconsin: Field Guide is a compact, shirt pocket size for easy portability and designed for use in conjunction with the also highly recommended Birds of Wisconsin Audio CDs (1591930391, $14.95) featuring the recorded sounds of 110 of Wisconsin's most commonly encountered birds."
5,Birds of Wisconsin: Field Guied (Book & CD),"Excellent Book. I was tired of searching on the internet everytime I saw a new bird visit us and have to sort through every bird known to man, finally think I have the right bird only to discover it never flys anywhere near Wisconsin. The book is also very user friendly for the beginner as the pages are color coded to help narrow down your search. The photo's are real and not a just a computer image and they show both the male, female and juvenile colorations. the CD set is also totally awesome. The book tells you exactly which CD and what track number to find every bird in the book. Its wonderful to finally be able to identify some of the unigue sounds you hear through out the day and put a ""face"" so to speak to the beautiful sounds. A++++++++++++++++"
3,disregard for consumers,"acoustic & daylight again were released earlier this year, so rhino should have issued long time commin as a seperate dvd. i'm not going to rebuy this box just for that even though im a big csn fan."
2,Left wanting,"At first, I was skeptical about the Eberron setting, but after trying it out - it was enjoyable, albeit different. I was looking forward to this book to find out more information to use in a campaign. Unfortunately, the book is mostly filled with the same information from the ECS presented in a different format. Sure, they include 1 prestige class per nation and some NPC stats and monsters - but the world was left just as vague. The power group and cultural information is definitely a plus to have - no other books have successfully detailed this before. Thrane was the most underdeveloped portion of the book though and if you want information on specific portions of the landscape, you'd be better off making it all up. Of the nations, Aundair and Breland are the only ones that have decent details on the geography. Bottom line: good for skimming, but no real meat to pour through anyway."
4,Very Interesting!,I thought this book was very interesting and I would read it over again. I am very satisfied.
1,Awful!!,"First off, I want to say that I love sport movies, and so I had high expectations for this one. The reviews looked good, so I gave it a shot. It is HORRIBLE. The acting is atrocious, and the coach is just downright mean. Halfway through, I stopped caring about the coach and the team, and I was just waiting for something good to happen, to change my mind. But nope. This is the worse sports movie I've ever seen. Thumbs DOWN!!! I'd give this NEGATIVE 5 stars if I could!!!I'm all for someone working out his/her personal demons, but not at the expense of others, ESPECIALLY kids. The world is hard enough without someone like that in a position of authority. And the swearing is too much. It just makes him sound uneducated. Awful. Awful. Awful."
5,Watch this movie!,"I saw this has only two reviews, I thought it's another indy that doesn't get it's due...Funny, endearing little gem. Just watch it, for crying out loud."
2,Two and a half stars,"This is not one of the disco legend's better albums, even though this CD reissue of Call Me contains additional remixes of several of the songs. There is some stylistic variety: a short gospel song, He'll Understand, and a passionate soul ballad, One Night Only. Good Feelin' is another soul number with an interesting arrangement and impressive vocals. The trouble is that the real disco songs lack catchy hooks or memorable tunes. Too Late and Power Of Love are great for the dance floor but not hit material. The album's saving grace is Sylvester's high-powered interpretation of the old classic Band Of Gold, quite a spectacular disco version, and even more so in the stunning remix. Unfortunately it shows up the lack of melody in the other songs. Sylvester's best work can be found on his Greatest Hits compilation."
1,Poor Results with HP CD-Writer+,"I bought a spindle of 100 of these and have had nothing but trouble with them on my HP CD-Writer+ 8200 series CD writer. About half the time I write them at 1X speed I get a good recording. At 2x and 4x speeds the resulting CDs are useless for me.The HP media seems to work for me under all conditions, so I blame the Imation CD-Rs."
3,A mixed bag,"These cd's aren't cheap for CD-R's, and their reliability is not that great. I have a HP CD writer plus and when making three copies of a cd, only one was without static noise and skipping. The sound quality is excellent, though."
2,Interesting but unorganized,"While I found the content fascinating, the author bounces around, often going off on tangents for pages before getting back to his original point. He includes lots of history about paranormal occurrences and research, but in no particular order.I was disappointed, given the the title of the book, that only the last two chapters are actually devoted to psychic detection (one of them being on the specialized field of psychic archaelogy).Overall, it reads like an interesting collection of paranormal occurrences throughout history, but by no means should it be used as research material."
5,Great for Camping or Preparedness,"Love this classic design stove. I bought this after using a retro ""white gas"" one that my brother snagged from a garage sale. This will go on every camping trip. And it can use regular gasoline instead of any special fuel.Easy to setup and use. Just pay attention to the instructions and lay off the cigar while refilling it."
4,Worked when USB didn't!,"Needed a way to connect the PCM for a Holley Commander 950 TBI set up to my laptop. The USB adapters kept locking up the software. Plugged this card in, set the com port and voila, I haven't had a software lock up yet. Sucks that it's so expensive compared to USB, but at least it does what I need it to."
5,awesome helps with immune system,really good packaged in capsules. I always take more elderberry to make sure that I don't get sick. It helps protect your body and immune system.
3,Book okay,"Book was okay, fairly basic felt elementary reading it, at times it became boring and I lost interest, I would not recommend buying this, borrow or go to library, not the kind of book you will reread, or keep on your shelf."
4,"Infinite Insights into Kenpo, Vol 5",This book is a must-have for Kenpo people to complete the Insights series. Ed Parker's re-arrangement of the Web of Knowledge is seen for the first time in book form. The first three beginner forms are illustrated as well.
4,Good Solid material for a strong foundation,I liked this book because it is pretty well explained and gave me a solid foundation to understand more about how to design Network Security for Windows 2000. I say it is a must for anyone seriously wanting to grasp a strong foundation in Windows 2000 Network Security.
3,HERO WANTED,"IT' WAS KOOL, I DO LIKE ACTION MOVIES SOMRTIMES THAT STORY IS THE SAME, IT'S USUALLY THE ACTOR THAT YOU KNOW! ... LIKE CUBA GOODING JR. MOVIES,"
2,A case where the viewer gets tortured.,2 stars is probably too much.What a waste of time..... a friend loaned me a copy. Some friend :)There is nothing to say about this film. You walk away feeling nothing.A lot of wasted talent. I hope they got a good pay check.
3,Good but overpriced.,"I recently purchased an international version of this book for considerably less than the price advertised on Amazon. For what I paid I consider it a good reference to have for SQA, but I still like Schulmeyer's Handbook of SQA which has a new edition coming out September 30 for $99. No disrespect intended, but the book seemed written by someone who was not a native speaker of English, so the wording can be a little difficult to follow."
3,the book started out well...,but as it progressed... the writing style seemed rather dulla unique story anyhow...
3,"For what it is, it isn't bad","I am reading this book for a class on Independence and Nationalism in Latin America and find that it is only appropriate for a very general survey of Latin American history. It is, perhaps, too concise! It is, however, informative and a very simple read. Chasteen wanted to make a history of Latin America readable and approachable and this book is definitely both. I would recommend this text with reservations. It paints a picture that is somewhat biased and full of holes. As an introductory reader, however, it succeeds.Would have given it a four-star rating, but the edition pictured (2006, second edition) is riddled with typographical errors. The index cites pages that are either blank or diagrams not related to the terms. Not exactly helpful! For example, the entry for Diego Rivera points to page 215, which is BLANK. The other side of the page (216) is in fact a mural by Rivera, but what gives?"
5,Very good flavor oil!,"Purchased this oil to make a light cheesecake with less splenda. Eureka, it worked. Very flavorful, and I will definitely buy again!"
2,"Too loud, stimulating for developing brains","I will sound very old-fashioned and out of touch in complaining of this toy's too-loud noises. Almost every child these days seems to have some digital squawk box of some type. But that doesn't make it smart.I would not submit such a very young child to noises this loud or unnatural (electronic). No, it won't damage their hearing per se. But parents must understand that this kind of over-stimulation in a young one's brain has more than a momentary effect; it can have a long-term and adverse auditory affect.Same with the lights. If you have to go to these lengths to capture a baby's attention, what will you do for Act II?How can you expect a child to pay attention to soft instruction/guidance/response from a parent when they have gotten accustomed to over-the-top stimulation?Yes, ADHD is genetic; toys like this won't ""cause"" ADHD. But overstimulation at any age has an effect on the brain, and not a good one."
5,The toy is the superstar,"Great toy, really entertains for a long time with it's sounds and colors. The mirror is a huge plus. Our one year old easily learned the different instruments and how to keep the sounds changing. It's good for at least a hour of fun."
3,My son just liked to look at himself,"My son recieved this for his first birthday, and all he cared about was looking at himself in the mirror. he didn't care much about the sounds and songs and lights. I could have gotten a small mirror for him to look at himself for a lot cheaper. My son was only intrested in the toy for about a month and then he was completly done with it."
4,fun for musical babies,"Our newly one-year-old daughter loves this. She sits and dances away in front of the mirror, kissing the cute baby she sees there, and pats the flashing lights. The song variety is good (some traditional songs and a few new ones that are pretty cute and catchy - a nice respite when the standards are getting on your nerves). The only big drawback is that the microphone holder fell off on day one. Aw well! Also, it would be good if you could hear the instruments' distinct sounds better. In the first mode (of the two available), only the trumpet / brass sound stands out from the rest. Still, our daughter loves it, so that's good enough for us."
4,Very entertaining,I bought this for my daughter's first birthday. She loves it. She dances and looks at herself in the mirror. Very entertaining and enjoyable. The songs are not annoying. Definitely recommend.
5,Great Toy!,"My 7 month old son received this as a gift for Christmas and so far it's his favorite toy! He loves looking at himself in any mirror so I thought it might be a big hit, but I didn't anticipate that since he was so close to the mirror he would start kissing his reflection!! The buttons keep him occupied for 20 minutes at a time and the songs are cute as well. I love the two volume settings too. Overall a great buy and doesn't take up too much room in our small house."
3,Could be better,"I would be much happier with this toy if it had a real microphone as opposed to a microphone-shaped rattle. It's a much more simple toy (for my one-year old) than I thought it would be, especially for the cost."
4,The twins love it!,"My 10-month-old twin girls absolutely love this little stage, and it keeps them entertained for long periods. Not understanding their reflection, I've caught them looking over the top of the stage, seemingly looking for the ""other"" baby they see."
5,Engages Babies thru PreSchoolers,I bought this for my grand daughter when she was 6 months and now she is 19 months she still loves to play with it. In fact my 7 month grand daughter and their 4 year brother loves to push the buttons. My grandson shouts out the colors as they light up and sings all the songs. His sisters including the baby dance to the music. It's fun and engaging for all kids 4 and under.
4,Baby loves it!,Our little girl loved it from the start. It allows for cause and effect interaction both visually and audibly. The music changes to feature the sound of the instrument that the child interacts with. I suspect that we'll get several years of use from this as her mind becomes more aware of the interaction happening.
5,"Love it, longest lasting of the infant toys!","This is great for the beginning sitter. You can place your child in the bumbo seat and they can work it with minimal hand/eye coordination. I bought it when my daughter was just learning to sit. I could sit her in front of this thing every day when I got home and have a minute to open the mail, etc. before she got tired of it. She is now a year and plays with it daily....believe me she has lots of choices. My four year old loves it as well. It is almost as popular as the ball popper thing with any kid who comes to my house."
3,Fun at times,"Bought this for my now 11 month old daughter. When she's in the right mood, she loves to sit at it, and bang the keys, watch the lights, chew and shake the microphone, and play peek-a-boo in the mirror. It will typically occupy her for about 20 minutes. She will also move and bounce along with the music. However, sometimes she will just sit in front of it, and ignore it, and play with other toys around her. I would probably buy it again, but it's not as entertaining as I thought it would be. The music is fun, and not annoying."
3,"""Old"" new toy?","After some internet research it appears this toy has been discontinued by FP, but it seemed like the only mirror that my 7 month old could sit in front of AND was actually a toy to keep her entertained. That's the only reason I paid $52 (which is clearly because it's no longer available and not the suggested retail). The white frame around the mirror was dirty on some of the edges and an entire panel appears yellowed/discolored. Overall just looks old, not used but maybe stored improperly. Came in Amazon's ""frustration-free packaging"" so it was removed from the original box. All the parts were there, but the cardboard song sheets that come with it were loose in the package and arrived bent and the edges were smashed/crumpled. Haven't decided whether to put it together and see if it works or just send it back..."
5,Musical Fun!,"I bought this for my 6 month old daughter, who is now almost 9 months. She loved it immediately, and still plays with it for long periods of time. The buttons are easy to bang and push, and the mirror is a big hit. The songs are cute and I don't find them annoying."
4,No complaints,Super fast shipping from Amazon. Ordered last minute for christmas and received it two days before christmas. Daughter loves it and spends hours dancing and singing with it.
4,My son loves it!,"My one year old received this as a Christmas present and loves it! With two volume settings the songs don't get annoying like most toys, and he even tries to sing in the microphone!"
3,Sad Tango,"I like the CD, but I thought it would have more then 4 songs on it. It has two songs with words and the same two songs with just music. I am disappointed, because I paid $21.97 for two songs basically."
5,Fun Infant Toy,This is a wonderful toy. My 3 months old daughter loves it. The bears head moves up and down and it plays music when she kicks the ball. She also likes to play with the dangling toys. She can also use this when she is older too. It changes into a sit up toy with the balls. Hopefully she will like it then too. Definitely recommend this toy.
4,Good but not Great,"You can never fault the Manhattan Transfer on quality - they're some of the best singers working today - but some of their song selections make me scratch my head in wonder. Maybe I'm younger than the average fan, but songs like ""Walking in New York"" are just a little too Lite FM for me. That said, I thought ""Greek Song"" was a risky choice that paid off very well. Overall the album is quite good, but there's not a track that truly stands out as classic MT. It's very well done, just not the collection of songs I was hoping for."
1,"Yeah, there are garbage","I have only been able to write once or twice with the pack I bought awhile back, everything else was errors or what not right off the bat. This was using different programs and computers. Obviously CD-RW's are a a thing of the past and all, but I have yet to come across any that work more than 5 times."
4,A good one,"This is a good puzzle, just that the sun is a bit challenging. My 3 year old just started doing 100 piece puzzle with help and she only wants to do stuff other than sun, not sure if it is because it is challenging or she looses interest. Usually she finishes all her puzzles including the other 100 piece sponge bob one, but this one she doesn't want to finish."
5,One Happy Granddaughter!!,"This adorable baby was the hit of our 2001 Christmas. My granddaughter, Emma, is a wonderful little mommy! There is no doubt that this doll teaches children that there is more to caring for babies than ""lugging"" them around. To watch Emma care for this baby is a joy. I'm buying TWO more for this Christmas.P. Seabolt"
4,"9"" Chou Chou Dolls","My wife found four 9"" Chou Chou dolls on the clearance rack at the grocery store, and bought all of them for our two granddaughters, who were already Chou Chou fans. They loved these dolls so much that we'd like to buy some more.Problem is, we don't know the proper name for this model of dolls, or where we can find some more. Any help in finding them will be appreciated.Like the other Chou Chou dolls we have bought for our granddaughters, these are quality dolls -- the kind you teach the kids to take good care of, not the ones they drag around any old way. They love them!"
1,Lousy doll,This doll stinks. My daughter received this for Easter and it didn't work. How do you explain that the Easter Bunny gives broken toys. The eyes won't shut and doesn't cry. Don't buy this unless you want your little girls to cry and be disappointed
3,baby chou chou,"We have had baby chou chou for one year now, my daughter loves the doll. The only problem is that with one good drop, she stops working. My daughter slipped and landed on her doll and now she no longer works, my daughter was disappointed, but she still plays with her most of the time compared to her other dolls."
1,Eye Dr. For New Chou Chou,"Anyone know a good eye Dr?.....Let me explain...For Christmas I got my 4 yr. old a 'Love Me Chou Chou'. Although she had many bad reviews because of her head crease, We all adore her. A few days ago I purchased A 'Rock-A-Bye' Chou Chou for my 3 yr. old, as they were fighting over the other Chou Chou. To Our horror, this doll only worked for approx. 5 minutes, then her eyes got some sort of blinking disease. Her eyes do not stop blinking, and she does absolutely nothing else. Every now and then she will act normal like, but only for a moment. This is not the batteries. [...]Why should I have to take a brand new defective baby to a doll doctor? ........Bottom line, we love the babies, but the service we just recieved really bites. [...] Good Luck!"
5,We love it!,Santa brought this doll to my 6 year old daughter last year. She loves it. It is so much like a real baby. It feels like a real baby too. We shut it off when not in use and have not had a problem with batteries. This doll is top quality!
5,Expecting Another Baby? -Get this one for the older sibling!,"My 3 yr old has really responded to this lovely doll and it is adorable to watch her mimic the care and cooing that we give to her baby sister when playing with the doll. This doll's interactions provide a really positive way for her to manage the changes in the household because of our new family member. The other birthday gifts have lost their attraction, but his doll is still sleeping with her each nite. Interesting sounds and responses and so far very sturdy - has been dropped a number of times onto hard surfaces with no ill affects!"
3,4 year old daughter HATES this doll.,"To be fair, my daughter isn't crazy about dolls in general. But this one scares her. The ""breathing"" noises it makes are pretty creepy and I've had to remove the batteries. I really had high hopes for this doll, but no dice. My daughter tells me all the time, ""I hate Baby Chou Chou"". The noises it makes aren't realistic, and are kind of annoying."
4,chokeable bottle,I am very upset. I bought three of these dolls for three of my daughters. One of the caps from the bottle fell off. This is a serious choaking hazard for my daughters or for there infant sister. God for bid they put it in her crib. I warn anyone who bought this item or who is considering buying this item to throw away the bottle.
4,Cascade 36x36 Shower Pan,"The shower pan is very well made. It is much thicker than the ones in the store at Lowes or Home Depot. I think it is worth the extra money.However the packaging that the Manufacturer does is quite poor.It comes in a large Box, without any foam ..no plastic bag...only a small piece of stick-on plastic over the Drain area. The first one I received was cracked , dented and scratched...I had to return it....the second one had only a few small scratches in the front....If they would atleast put it in a Bag inside the box so that it would not rub on the cardboard box all the way to its destination.Just be prepared to send it back if it suffers a rough trip in shipping."
2,More In-Depth Please!,I found the book very shallow and typical. The book barely scratches the surface of this complex subject. Definately NOT worth the money.
2,Didn't meet expectations,"You have to squeeze the thing to get it to read the correct humidity and it doesn't say that in the directions. For the money, I feel that it wasn't a good purchase."
3,Scanning software makes a mess,"Very distracting are the numerous text errors that apparently are the result of the scanning software. Hardly a page goes by without some goofy word substituted for the original, aggravated by Burton's antique English and words he made up when there was no English equivalent of the Arabic. So, for instance, we get ""golf-embroidered"" instead of ""gold-embroidered;"" ""shine"" instead of ""thine;"" ""cloth"" instead of ""doth;"" ""snorted and sparked"" for Burton's ""snorted and snarked,"" and on and on. Burton's translation of the rhymed prose and poetry can be a heavy slog for those accustomed to more lightweight versions of these tales, and these scanning errors make the situation even worse.But considering what a good print copy of Burton's 16 volumes costs, this is a bargain, despite the mental trip-ups caused by the ridiculously inappropriate word substitutions. At least the footnotes are linked, and the table of contents works OK."
3,Great book but the print is too small,I am having a difficult time reading it because the print is so small. I can only get through a couple of pages before my eyes get tired.
1,would not generally recommend,I would not generally recommend buying this book since it is not meant for a general reader at all. Buy the penguin edition instead.
5,"I actually look forward to ironing, LOVE this spary starch!!!","This spray starch works great and smells FANTASTIC! Almost makes me want to iron things I normally wouldn't! It won't make fabrics stiff as a board, but it does a great job. After I spray it on I let it sit on the fabric a few minutes to absorb. Then the iron glides flawlessly over the fabric, & with the wonderful aroma this makes one chore quite pleasant!"
2,Namco Museum.,Namco Museum all in all is a terrible game unless you are a diehard fan of ms.pac man. The game shows a terrible quality of graphics. It lacks the beautiful colors that the game boy advance is capiable of. The animation is like of gameboy pocket quality. Trust me folks save your money and by a quality game like mario kart:super circuit.
4,If young kids only knew..,This is one of my favorite gameboy advance games. The games are exactly as I remember them spending all that time and quarters at the arcade. Just think of all the money you could of had if we had an gameboy advance then. Anyway kids today might find these games simple and not hold their interest long. But it's perfect for an adult who enjoyed them as a kid and only has 30 minutes for lunch and wants to forget about the job for a moment.
1,Old school is just that----OLD,"I don't understand the reasoning behind these old-school games--especially on such a capable system as the GBA. Nostalgia, perhaps? Maybe, but I'm not buying into the scheme. These games are old and tired, and don't age very well. Don't waste your time, or more importantly, your money."
4,Secrets,"If you are looking for a quick fix, go somewhere else. This is a protracted exercise in habit modification which requires effort.That being said, that is the only way to truly effect change, to make an effort."
1,Give me a break!,"This is a hard sell for even the most extreme completists. Yes, Play is one of the most amazing cds of '99 (if you're looking at this single, you are probably fully aware of that), but I could not help but gagging when I heard Gwen Stefani's vocals tacked onto a decent song. They add nothing to the song other than my incredible urge to turn it off. Save your money & go see him live :) Sorry Moby... next!"
1,"The song is excellent, but..........","Don't get me wrong, the song South Side is great but..........I just thought that there could've been some more versions/remixes of it included...this single has only two tracks and is not really worth getting to me. A few more versions of South Side along with some B-Side tracks would've made this single more worth it in the end. I bought this single used at a music store for .95 cents...at least i only wasted a $1.10 total *shrug*. Gwen Stefani and Moby actually blend quite well together as they sing the chorus in the whole song. That's my review, thanks."
2,Trudging through mud,"Now I know why I found this book in the $5.00 Bargain Bin. I picked it up to entertain me over some flights and it mostly succeeded in inducing sleep - which was a plus, I suppose. You'd think some extraordinary things could happen living in an old castle in Prague in the early 1990's. Not to mention the intrigue possible when a married woman runs off to live with her lover exiled in Libya due to some unspecified spy activity. Sadly, nothing really ever happens except long drawn out descriptions of minutia written in a beautiful, deeply detailed language but sometimes (I feel) meant to make the reader feel like a idiot, running to the dictionary or google to look up deliberately difficult words and references. Rather a snore, all in all."
4,Good Blend,"The Helen Grace Chocolate Coconut Egg is a great blend of coconut chunks, cream, and chocolate. I bought a few different brands of coconut eggs and I have to say this brand is by far the best I've had. I really wish they shipped to APO addresses for military folks trying to get a piece of home."
5,Great Stories,"Louis L'Amour is a great writer, he has a way in bringing you into the story, making you feel you are in the story.My husband is a big fan of his and he really enjoys following the Sackett Family. It is one of his more favorite seriesof L'Amour's books."
3,Fun Game,"My now 8yr old daughter got this game last x-mas. After playing it a few times, she became frustrated because some of the questions were too hard for her. Overall it is a fun game to play."
3,Decent album.,"I liked one song, ""Use no Hooks"" a lot, great guitar riff and just all-out rockin'. The rest of the album, I can take it or leave it. It just didn't hook me.I liked there second album ALOT better."
5,Geography,This is a lovely globe; the colors are brilliant. A wonderful learning tool. I received it in record time and ordering was a breeze. A fine product.
3,Globe,"I bought this for the classroom, its allright, but the stand is pretty cheap.I've seen better from this company."
1,Broken after 1 day of use,"This was a christmas gift for our 5 year old. The same day she opened it, the bottom tab broke inside the globe. unable to be replaced. Very inconvenient to have to return item."
5,one of the most moving films ever made,"""The Shop on Main Street"" is one of the five best movies I have ever seen. This masterpiece from Czechoslovakia is one of the most humanistic films of all time, telling the epic story of the Nazi holocaust through two beautifully developed characters. This extraordinary film relies on understatement to chronicle an event that, when visualized fully, often becomes too unbearable to watch. Instead, the filmmakers concentrate on the conflict that develops when a well-meaning but timid carpenter must protect an elderly Jewish shopkeeper from persecution. This ingeniously worked out situation leads to a final half hour that is, perhaps, the most intensely dramatic and emotionally wrenching sequence in film history. The performances of Josef Kroner and Ida Kaminska are without peer and the eerie and haunting musical score lingers with the viewer long after this great film has ended. This film is the definition of great cinematic art!"
3,Ok for pancakes but not for hamburger,"The spatulas are okay if you want to make french toast, small hotcakes/pancakes or anything that doesn't need a stiff edge. The spatulas have too much flexibility beyond the metal piece in the plastic. If you plan on using them for hamburger or anything else that may need scraping or ""cutting"" into smaller pieces, these spatulas are crappy at it. In fact, they suck. They also bend and flex in the dishwasher if they are put near the door. Putting them on the top shelf of the dishwasher helps."
3,"So Far, So Good","I've had the chargers and have been using them for about three weeks now, and they seem to have no problems. Construction is a little cheap, but that's to be expected at this price. They've worked great. I've only used the data cable once, but it worked just fine to transfer files from my computer to my Samsung Propel. I'm definitely glad I bought these instead of paying $30 apiece for each item somewhere else."
2,Wall Charger Showed Up DOA,"I mean what can you expect from such a cheap product, but the Wall Charger showed up DOA, but the other two worked just fine. I really only needed a car charger so it was alright, just be warned."
2,Cheaply made,I bought two of these and both fell apart in less than a year. Spend the money and get something that will last.
2,"Great jewelry, poor perception","I'm always impressed by Abby's accessories, but her perceptions of other people are somewhat appalling. My two daughters find her and Candy Apples Kathy quite villainous. Also this episode is strictly filler and can be skipped."
4,Love Love Love this show! Thank you!,Thank you for making it so easy to own Dance Moms TV show. I enjoy this show alot and cant wait till season 3!!! Kinda sucks they took 2 episode off:( One on Season 1 & 2. But... Overall great show! Thanks:)Mimi
1,Wrong Episode,"I purchased what I thought was Dance Moms latest episode that aired lastnight (8-28), but when I started watching it was an episode from weeksago. What can be done about this? Someone else wrote in concerning thesame issue."
1,wrong episode,Same issue as previous reviewer. The episode I purchased is not the one showing. It is from much earlier in the season.
5,Great new edition,"This comprehensive, non-heroworshipping history of the American aviation/weapons business unfortunately slipped out of print for a few years, but is now available again from Johns Hopkins with a new preface. It is still unparalleled for telling the story of a pivotal industry without being stupified either by government secrecy or corporate obfuscation. A must-read for anyone interested in ""defense"" issues."
1,A Useless New Edition,"Sixty dollars spent for a new cover, some corrections in the index and a general increase in values is about all that is new in this edition. If you have the older one, don't bother! I felt cheated."
4,"Intresting plot,but a predictable ending-not one of the best","This book has a unique plot, and as always intresting twists and turns, but not one of her usual suprise endings. In my opinion, it was a very disappointing ending, and not as well written as the rest of the books."
3,fades into the background,"I bought this to use for yoga class music. There is one or two ideal tracks for a yoga class (""Signs"" in particular, for one) but the majority of songs are either too hyper or just fade into the background. Decent for rounding out yoga playlists that just need one more song."
4,Perfect Driving Music,"I personally find this a very genreless cd, it flows well from end to end, has high quality production, its funky, different and most importantly, its listenable time and time again. Don't try and compare it to Talvin or Tabla Beat Science because it isn't them. What it is, is a great excursion thru a crossbreed of musical styles. Perfectly executed and very precise. Throw it in the car and go for a nice ride out in the country."
2,The poor quality of the essays indicates an incompetent teacher,"While the essays collected in this book are amusing, they also invoke a high degree of sadness. Eighth grade students wrote these history ""essays"" and so much of the content is abominable. The spelling, grammar and factual basis are very wrong, demonstrating that the writer had no idea what the subject matter was. Quite frankly, if I had been the teacher of the class where these essays were written, I would never have published them. For the poor quality demonstrates that the teacher of the class is of questionable competence. To collect them into a book and try to profit from them is to my mind inexcusable."
5,bobby,"This was a present for my mom. She remembers the day when Bobby was killed, as she does the day that JFK was killed.I wanted her to have this DVD, so I bought it here. I thank you."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Wow - was this bad. Unfocused and bad.Estevez threw everything (and I do mean everything) against the wall to see what would stick. Nothing does.CHADS. the Dodgers. VietNam. LSD. Adultery. Race relations. Unfulfilled marriages. Depression.The depression comes from the hackneyed script (also by Estevez). It did for me. Bobby Kennedy is about the only thing that is the tertiary in this film. Even the clips of him campaigning don't fit in as they could or should. Let's not forget the historical facts that could have easily been worked into the story are so skewed and just plain made-up it's sad.The acting is bland - for most of the parts. Is there anyone who said 'no' to a part in the movie? Oddly enough, Sharon Stone is one of the better people in it - and she is someone I think is normally talentless. But to be fair - she has little competition: Lindsay Lohan? Aston Kutcher? Demi Moore?? Yikes.I didn't buy or rent - I saw it on cable, and the price was way to high."
3,INTERESTING AND MOVING 3 1/2 STARS!,"'Bobby' deals with the lives of many people who were in the hotel where Robert Kennedy was shot in 1968. The film has several good performances and is broken into small stories about the various people at the hotel that day. I'm not sure how accurate this film is, but it works for the most part and it is somewhat emotion at the tragic finale.Some of the stories are more interesting than others and it does seem to meander at time. Given the subject matter, the tone of the film seemed to be all over the place. It's definitely worth watching once."
5,Excellent movie,"Emelio Estevez did an excellent job with this movie. It showed how Bobby Kennedy affected the lives of people. It was good how he put the various footage of Bobby Kennedy's campaign trail in the movie as well. As I was only a wee baby at the time, it was excellent to see."
5,BO BBY,"Bobby is a good film to watch, it stimulates your imagination. It shows a lot of life going on at the same time. While during the time that Bobby was campaigning, a lot of subplots was going on. The life of the entertainer-played by Demi and the the role of her manager husband as well. It shows the intricacy of how it is to live a life in politics as well as the life in show business. It affects the hotel industry and the the different people involved in that industry. In sum, Bobby is a story that's not have a happy ending but a story of what have been- if..."
3,"Bosch 47720 Winter Wiper Blade, 20""","THEY WORK PRETTY WELL, EXCEPT INSTALLATION IS DIFFICULT ANT BEING MOSTLY PLASTIC, THYE EASILY BREAK!! THE LAST ONE I BROUGHT FROM AMAZON.COM WORKED BETTER,"
4,Amazing Story,"This book drew me in easily and kept my attention throughout. During WWII, the American Navy found a more deadly enemy than either Germany or Japan when it faced Typhoon Cobra in December 1944. The typhoon took Admiral Halsey's fleet by surprise and was devastating with 3 ships lost and over 700 men. Although there may be better books on this incident, I found this one to be riveting. The best part of the book is the story of the sinking of the 3 warships, the crews' the struggle to survive, and the rescue operation that followed. The book is inspirational and frightening at the same time. Very enjoyable--especially for WWII and naval history fans."
2,Question?,"Despite the two typo errors by page 17, my question about this book deals with life preservers. The authors repeat a number of times the claim that the ""Mae West"" life preserver was some kind of old style replaced by the ""newer"" kapot style. My understanding is the Mae West was issued to air crews and never as standard issue to surface vessel crews and was in fact, a newer design. Where they got this idea that kapot was some newer design that replaced the Mae West and why they say it did so over and over may well be another ""Untold"" part of the story."
2,Not worth the price ...,"I bought this book because I thought it might have new material in it. I suppose the last chapters might satisfy this, but the book as a whole was disappointing. It is mainly an historical re-do of the US 3rd/5th Fleet's operations in 1942 - 1944, loosely centered on the typhoon.What really turned me off was a tin ear for the language of the sea and the arts of the mariner. The terms used to describe basic maritime activities are off base ... example; the reference to ""helming' a ship. It was obvious early in the book that this was not written by anyone with any amount of sea time. The over-the-top language used to describe the typhoon was unseamanlike and repetitive.The book would have been much better had someone with a maritime background, and preferably command experience or group command experience, read a final proof and corrected it for terminology and style."
4,Another example of courage.,"I don't know if Admiral Halsey was negligent or irresponsible or not, but I doubt that he was. I think he probably acted with the best information he had at the time and had to make a decision. It's easy to second-guess.I do think this is just another example of the courage and bravery ordinary men faced during the times of strife that they faced. The book did leave me with several questions however, i.e. how did the Navy report the ships that were lost? How about the men that were lost were they reported KIA or just lost at sea? I do think KIA is appropriate for surely they faced an enemy of great magnitude, and some of them defeated this enemy and survived. I would certainly recomment it as a reading."
1,Does not do what the box implies or what the manual says,"The manual clearly states: ""Drop balls in the basket... for fun sounds, music and lights."" This is not what the toy actually does - the tipping action has to be activated by the user (in this case, my 7 month-old) and so is not the positive reinforcement toy I had hoped for."
2,Crap... not better way to put it.,"Sure... it still standing, but about the stupidest toy ever. My daughter ""loves"" it... for about two seconds when she remembers its boring. As other reviews say, it does not work as advertised. You can throw those balls all day long and it will not make noise unless you physically push the net. Also, the tail does take up some room. Not that bad, unless you're dealing with a storage shortage. Don't waste your money or you space!"
4,Nice,"This album is a perfect mix of trip hop and dance music, with all the elements of the relaxed Brazilian lifestyle. If you don't have beautiful female vocals then you have the tropical sounds of the amazon, and much more. It will mellow you out and make you feel good.Give it a listen."
3,athlete,"dont really know if does anything, but I use it anyway, I think creatine is just for looks, you dont get a boost from it"
2,on creatine,whats up i use on's protien so i decided to give the creatine a chance and it did nothing for my pumps and energy was minimal i think before you trie this you should try gaspari size on or bsn no explode but thats just me
3,"Good creatine, gritty taste","I love ON products, and I take this creatine every day, but it does have a gritty taste and texture. You have to really stir this well for about 2 minutes to be palatable, but I add mine to my morning greens. If you use it in a shake or blender, it will probably blend better. No taste, but it can be sandy, so just be aware when you purchase. I prefer the creatine capsules and will be getting those in the future."
5,Good stuff as far as I can tell...,Got this to take with my HMB. HMB is the real deal and it's supposed to work better with Creatine. I think this creatine is fine.
3,Still prefer the Concret Creatine,"Tried this product to save some money versus the Concret brand. It is OK, no trouble getting used to it. It is just a lot more product everyday compared to the Concret. The price is definately right though. Wish it came with a scoop rather than having to use a spoon."
4,Decent Creatine,I've used this in the past. Good quality creatine at a good price bottle usually lasts 45 days. Still not 100% sold on creatine efficacy.
3,Not sure what to say about Creatine !,"I've taken this product for 3 weeks and saw enormous increase in stamina and power to lift heavy weights. But i put on about 20 pounds. this was kind of set back.If you take creatine, make sure you workout and take good protein, or else the weight you gain is just water. Its hard to lose the water, it will take some time to get rid of it, at least that's the case with me."
4,What You Can Expect From ON,"As far as creatine goes, I really think that this gets the job done. Every creatine I've ever tried has a kind of gritty, sand feel when you drink it, and this is no exception although it's as ""un-gritty"" as I've ever had. Been on it for two weeks, I can see some small differences already. The only other creatine I would recommend is CREATure by Beast, it has a nice citrus flavor, but a 300g tub is as expensive as a 600g bottle from ON. I'll re-buy this for sure."
4,OK product,Have not notice any difference after using this product thats why I think that the soy protein is much better.
2,"Honeybee Tree fun for kids, but.....","Lots of giggles for the little ones with this variant on the age-old ""pick up sticks"" game -- but not so many for the adults who have to set it up. Inserting the ""leaves"" is a good fifteen minute exercise and it isn't something a four-year-old can do effectively. Playing the game is good for maybe five minutes, then it's back to the set-up task again. When you find yourself hiding a toy on Day Two of the grandkids' visit, it ain't a good sign!"
2,Annoying.,"Like other reviews have mentioned (why don't I read the reviews before I buy toys!!??) this game is a nuisance. It takes forever to set it up, > 5 minutes, then the game is played in about 2 minutes, max. The bees are cute, the game is sturdy. We never play it anymore. Kerplunk is similar and easier to set up, more fun to play."
1,Too much work!,"This game takes way too much time to set-up. Poking the long, thin stems through the tiny holes takes forever! The basic idea of this game is the opposite of what preschoolers want to do. They WANT to wake the bees and have them fall in the tray. This game is really only good for teaching basic turn taking."
2,Too much set up for very little play time,"Not worth it! Takes soo long to set up,then it's all done in two minutes. All the frustration/set up for nothing. There are way better games out there!"
2,"Super cute & fun, but way too long to set up.","We loved this game in pictures. Finally got it for a birthday & loved playing it, until the newness wore off (after game #2) and we were no longer patient with taking longer to set it up than to play it! I don't know how I would change it to make it better, but the set up just makes the game not worth playing! That and the turning of the tree in the base for each turn just jostles the bees into falling. So we now use the base and 10 bees to do a number match up work & the kids love it!"
3,Sock'em - Bop'em they are NOT...,"My son LOVES King Kong... but the stand that they are suppose to stand on... They do not stick in easily and the dinosaur doesn't go in at all. So sock'em - bop'em they are not. But, we place them in the skull island playset and still have a little fun. But, the stand with the handset is worthless."
3,Not Good Enough for me,I recieved this bag as a gift last year for christmas and now having more than 50 games 6 controllers cables and ethernet cables for the system this bag is pretty much well useless I dont think It was intended for carrying more than the system 2 controllers and the cables which is a bummer but what I did is bought a 96 cd case holder I put all of my games in that and use that to transport the games its a really good idea everyone should do that.
1,This is ok,It would be nice if I had my case. I ordered it on June 7 and it hasnt even been shipped and it's now June 21. How much longer do I have to wait to get this. If your the person who i bought this from email me a.s.a.p. at grenshaw07@aol.com thank you
5,You need this carrying case,"i jsut bought this carrying case about a week ago but it is very usefull. Ive had my xbox for about amonth carrying it back and forth everywhere usally just a house a way but it is so heavy. With this case there are no problems at all it is great,a must"
2,Rather self-explanatory and repetitive,"Lindstrom has proven himself to be a rather incompetent writer. He utilizes the same examples over and over again, resulting in a detrimental effect on his credibility. In addition, he describes behaviour that the average odeon would be able to explain. For instance, how our senses affect our emotions. He would have been better off devoting his book to explaining the pros and cons of the various ideas he has introduced and evaluate them, instead of just describing it. The book started off promising but soon became dull."
5,An unusual treatise based on Millward Brown's study,"Martin Lindstrom's Brand Sense: Build Powerful Brands Through Touch, Taste, Smell, Sight And Sound provides an unusual treatise based on Millward Brown's study linking branding and sensory awareness. 'Sensory branding' is a relatively new concept: Brand Sense takes the next step from study results to outline a six-step program for bringing brand building into modern times. Examples cover products and retail marketing alike, demonstrating the basics of establishing an appealing marketing approach based on more than sight and sound alone."
1,so close and so far away,"I waited with anticipation for the discman. After returning from vacation and finding it waiting I opended the package, searched for 2 new batteries, and grabbed my favorite CD. Read all the info and was ready to go, but the discman ""got up and went"". It played 1 and 1/2 CD's, never to play again. It is going back to the shop and they can sail it away. Loved the sound while it lasted. I guess I will have to grow up and buy an Ipod."
2,Nice but caution,"Pretty nice device but here are some cautions.1) Volume does not go loud enough to hear on noisy train or airplane2) When it starts up, the volume is automatically set to 1 on range 1-313) To hear at start up you have to remember to find small volume up button on side and view hard to read LCD display until it gets up in to your desired volume setting4) A little tricky to open to insert disck"
2,Read CAREFULLY,"I'd had this item on my wish list for a long time and was just about to purchase when I re-read the information. I hadn't seen this on first inspection: a warning that the disc was for Region 2, or European players, and would not play on my U.S. machine. So glad I checked it out before I made the purchase! Buyer beware, indeed! Saved several unpleasant hours, no doubt. I'll plan to do this with any artist now who works ""over there""."

3,SLOTS TOO NARROW FOR MOST POPULAR KNIFE SIZES,"I have my 5.5 inch vegetable knife in the largest slot, the chef's knife is too large to fit, my serrated carving/bread knife in the middle size slot and my mini paring knife in the smallest slot. It's unlikely that a santoku could fit in the largest slot so what is this inexpensive knife block good for? Why buy it? I am keeping it because it was the cheapest storage for my one fancy knife, the aforementioned 5.5 inch vegetable knife. The chef's knife is too much for me.There seems to be no way to remove the slot cover to clean out the block therefore this would be ideal for a roach nest. For this reason, I would hope no one else purchases this knife block.Is this frugal? not exactly although it was cheaper than other storage options for my pricey veggie knife i.e. $12.49Would I have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist? noDid I shop around for the best total price including the manufacturer's website? yes and so should you"
2,"This is the GAME case, not the SYSTEM case...","Don't be fooled... this is the GAME case for carrying Xbox discs around. There is another product on Amazon by the same company called 'Xbox Game SYSTEM Carrying Case' that is for carrying around your Xbox console, which is quite worth the money if you travel often with your system to 16-player Halo LAN parties. Being as the games all come in those stylish green keep cases anyway, all you'd really need for safe software transport is a plastic bag..."
5,Wonderful,"I love this program, watched every one of them when it was on and I was stunned to discover that somehow I'd missed a lot of episodes. The complete series was worth every penny. Quality DVD's, well delivered, good timing for everything."
5,Kung Fu,"The initial movie and the series were great. I am using the series to get my grandsons interested in martial arts.The series teaches some moral character and is deviod of all the filthy languate and sex that we find in every moviemade today. I would recommend this to everybody, young or old"
5,Kung Fu: The Complete Series,"I loved this series as a teen, and I like it even more now. Another thing I like is the format of the DVD. By that I mean I like the ""play all"" option. I hate DVDs where I have to press the select option after each episode."
3,Poor quality,"The first dvd in the set was damaged, and we're not able to get through the very first show. It just stops playing 1/2 way through and won't go any further. The rest of the CD's are fine. I bought this for my husband & I, as we were big fans of the series when it came on back in the 70's. Unfortunately, we grew up and now re-watching the episodes, we find it kind or boring and hokey. I think it will be better once we get further into the season as I kind of remember alot more action than what we've seen so far."
2,hard read,I had a hard time following the characters in this book. Maybe that was the intension so as to not give away the ending.
4,Page turner,My first read of Bourdain's fiction. Big fan of his others. Good read. Kept my interest throughout. His storytelling is great.
2,An easy but somewhat bland read,"I enjoyed Kitchen Confidential a lot more for its witty writing and colourful insights into the restaurant business. This fiction novel however, disappoints as the pace is slow, the action limited and the characters predictable. It is nevertheless unpretentious and an easy read."
3,"It was good to read on a long plane ride, but beyond that...","It's clear that what Bourdain writes about best are: 1) descriptions of cooking (note the descriptions of making fish soup and the debate about beurre blanc); 2) methadone programs; and 3) the use of the ""f"" word as every part of speech.The plot in this book is weak which is tolerable if the rest of the features of the book make up for it. But they don't. The disappointment is that the book ends as if Bourdain just decided to stop writing as opposed to any coming together of events.Parts of the book are very funny, but Bourdain's writing is terribly uneven. At times he'll provide terrific descriptions of something, and other times he gives a sparse view.Read it at the beach or on a long trip. Borrow someone else's copy."
4,Good book so far,"I am about halfway into this book. I received it not knowing what I was getting and I was surprised when it had arrived and I read what the book was about. Anyways, I just started reading and I have been pleased and entertained so far. I like that there is lots of food/cooking/chef stuff and references in the book. I'm excited to finish it :)"
5,Works as advertised,My brother uses these for the rat problem on his base serving overseas. He says that it works really well. They can't escape and DIE.
5,works great,"I had a mice problem and they were hiding in a hole in the stove, so i set these traps just outside the stove and they worked every single time, not one mis-fire. If the mouse goes for the bait, he's a dead man. I caught 10 mice in all, I would definitely reccomend them."
3,Cruel,"Mice were getting into the wild bird seed in my garage so I bought 2 of these.I caught my first mouse yesterday. The trap came down on the poor things head and did not kill it. I don't know how long it had been in the trap but it was still very much alive and breathing when I found it. It must have fractured it's skull because when I released it, it just hunched over and didn't move.I admit I'm a softie but I feel awful. I threw the traps in the trash. The mice can eat the bird seed. I couldn't deal with that again. A mouse trap should have enough power to kill, not just injure."
5,Worked on the first night!,"We were using another trap we got at Home Depot for $7, and it had not caught a single mouse. So then I ordered this one off amazon for $3 (including shipping!). Put a little peanut butter in it and put it next to the fridge, and then the next morning there's a dead mouse! Hooray! Considering it cost less than half than my other trap and actually works, I'd say this thing is a steal!"
2,Can't believe they didn't work!,"After reading all the rave reviews about this mouse trap, I decided to purchase three. My husband set up 2 outside and one inside. We have yet to catch ONE mouse! The trap snaps, the bait's gone, but no mouse. Interestingly, the old wooden traps we have continue to work. I really can't figure this one out, but it's hard to believe that these are the same traps that so many raved about. Truly a disappointment!"
2,Flimsy,"These are probably fine for catching the occasional mouse in your house, but they aren't for heavy use. I needed them for a tack room at a horse stable, where there are plenty of mice. The traps worked fine for a few kills and then gave up."
5,Exceed expectation,I didn't it expect it to be that successful when I saw its actual size. It caught the first mice in my newly bought house. In total it has caught 50% of all the catch so far.
1,No good,Did not work. Either I have really smart mice in my house or the trap was faulty. Bait kept getting stolen but lever did not come down.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered CalMix because I have a very fearful, stressed out cat who is attacking her companion and has to be kept separate. Unfortunately, the tablets are HUGE and have a very strong, herbal smell. I offered the entire tablet to my cat, hoping she'd like the smell and eat it, but she refused it. Normally, I use 'pill pockets' when I have to give my cats tablets, so I tried to cut a CalMix tablet into smaller pieces using a pill-cutter, but I ended up with lots of chunks and 'crumbs'. Even when hidden in the 'pill pockets', my cat refused to eat CalMix. This product seems more appropriate for dogs (the enormous tablets are chewable) than for cats. I'm not sure if a dog would like the strong herbal smell/taste; however, if you have an anxious dog and, like me, are pretty desperate, I'd give it a try; not for cats, though."
4,Denver hip hop is coming up!!!!,this cd is pretty tight. the words and beat are clicking......is something that the hip hop world really needed.
1,"Cool cover, boring music","I really liked the cover of this album so I picked it up. After several lessons I don't like any of the songs, nor do I remember them. Please, do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else."
4,"Good For The Newbie, So So for the older fan","Don't let my title give you the wrong impression, I will use this book as a reference and now I feel like I know the other memebers of the band a little better because honestly I couldn't tell who was who for a while though I knew all their names. The title is misleading, I wouldn't call it ""The Definitive Guide"" I mean it's only 100 pages of imformation, and aside from giving me some ideas of boots to look out for it didn't leave with a feeling of ""I've learned something"" that I've gotten from other books of a similiar nature about different artists. I also understand it's not like the author was able to sit down and talk to everyone involved in depth and personal like, but aside from that it's a good little reference guide. I think it's a bit pricey though considering what you get."
4,A definite purchase with a lot of sampling,"Unfortunately I cannot give any artist who makes use of samples as much as Miss Stone 5 stars although I feel that she has really created something truly original and satisfying with her use of Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye music to name just a few of the artists that were sampled.Part jazz, part fusion, part soul... it's great listening.It's definitely a must have album but let's not go too far in our praise for work that is not entirely original."
2,Slightly Disappointed,I expected more information about particular species and their habits and what rigs to use. The book was VERY general. Good for a beginner but lacking detail in what others beyond this level might want. It has a thorough explanation about knots.Again- good for beginners but not what I was looking for or expected.
3,Wide spectrum. Shallow depth.,"Not a bad book, but not what I was hoping for. I wanted to learn about specific set-ups for specific types of fishing - for instance tie-ups for back-bouncing salmon, rigs for trolling for tuna, etc. ...complete with all of the meaty details of course. That is not what this book is. Essentially this is an encyclopedia of fishing tackle, providing an overview of everything but not really delving into anything. May be a good book for a beginning angler who knows nothing of fishing or for an old salt to put on the shelf to show others what he is talking about, but I didn't find any major take-aways."
3,not what i expected,"the book was ok, but it was not what i expected--it could have used more info on particular ways to use certain tackle, but the knot tying info was very useful but takes a lot of practicing"
2,Disappointing,"Outside of 'Thundercloud' and 'Split Personality' this is a worthless album. It's neither bad nor good, it's just there.'Thundercloud' though belongs in the canon of Sweet's best work. The track features diverse instruments like the flugelhorn and theremin to evoke the sounds of a thunderstorm. The song starts pleasantly, then becomes slower until it hits the turbulent solo. By the end everything's calm again. Masterful.Also, Sweet's irritating backwards CD packaging (everything's in reverse..like the title, get it?) clashes with my entire collection and worst of all really, really bugs me."
3,Excellent Production - Cliched Poor Me Lyrics,"The music seems to have the best elements of 1966-67 pop-rock, which is not an easy feat, especially since he was using vintage equipment for the most part. But the lyrical content seems like Sweet either wrote them real quickly just to have lyrics for the songs...or he was trying too hard to have some sort of weird, ""Oh, I'm gonna die so feel sorry for me"" angle going on."
4,SWEET IS STILL SWEET,"I have several Matthew Sweet CD's and was very pleased with his latest effort. I enjoyed it the first time I listened to it. He doesn't have a lot of his excellent guitar work on this album, but is once again testing new waters. I haven't been too impressed with a couple of his albums (which I won't name), but he hits the mark with this one. ""Write Your Own Song"" is TOO good. The lyrics make that one! ""Thunderstorm"" is a tapestry of sounds - I think it is the best ""long song"" I've heard in a while. It doesn't bore you with pointless wanderings. ""Faith In You"" & ""Untitled"" are clever and two of my favorites on this album.No matter how many albums Sweet puts out, he never fails to try new avenues. That is why I admire his music. I like the artist and what he puts forth - it shows up in his music - DARE TO BE YOU! So, if you want to know who Sweet is, this is a very good start."
5,One THousand Beautiful Things,"I have had A copy of this Book most of my life and lost the last one I had or gave it away, not knowing it would take me years to find another and finally did . I love it. IT HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL POEMS AND SHORT INSPIRING STORIES AND PROS. THAT YOU WILL EVER FIND. It is worth finding and keeping around all the time when you just need to read something beautiful and inspiring."
2,Meaningless synthesizer noodlings.,"Somewhere along the line, certain musicians began to associate uninspired vanilla music to spirituality. New age piano noodlings and directionless melodies somehow inspire ""tranquility"". It's largely the same tranquility that causes you to sleep soundly when the TV channel you were watching is broadcasting white noise at 2am.There's still something to be said for calming ambient music ... but at least give it some substance.See if you can find some audio samples of Jim Oliver, Steven Halpern, Suzanne Ciani, ... even John Tesh. Give those a listen before buying this CD. All better places to start than this."
3,"Measure twice, THEN buy","It works. It doesn't blow off, all it does is whistle, but it works. MAKE SURE you read the measurements on this thing before you buy. I bought it and ended up having to do alot of work trying to get a good enough flow for it to work because my aftermarket muffler was way too big. I had to take offmy exhaust tip for it to fit better, so now it looks a little uglier. BUT, all things considered, it WORKS. Don't repeat my mistakes and you should be a very happy customer."
3,fun toy,its a pretty kool toy its a pain to install wish the blots/ect would hold better sounds pretty good the real thing is still better
1,this thing SUCKs!!!,"first off, it doesnt sound like turbo, maybe a tea kettle! I have a stock muffler on my acura tl, and still sounds terrible. it doesn't have easy installations. you have to drill a hole in your muffler to make it stay. if u dont whistle will fall off later. dont buy this item, unless the price is $5.00!"
2,It's a prankers toy,I put it on my brothers 2001 honda accord without his knowing. He got so mad at me for doing it. but the funny thing is I told him its stuck on there forever. I did this 6 months ago
5,A small classic,This study of Jewish life at the end of the Middle Ages was when it was first published in the early sixties considered a breakthrough work. The late Yaakov Katz was for many decades one of the outstanding students of Jewish social life. This work is a model of clarity in both conception and writing.
5,Sean is insane!,This album is fantastic. Sean really rips it up. It's great for both party's and hanging out. One to have if you're a fan or the guitar. I heard he can sign to but I'm not sure about that. I guess we'll have to wait for another album to see if he does.
3,"convenient, but not durable","This Scrabble set is a convenient little game, but the tiles are very very small pieces of plastic and hard to handle sometimes. Great for kids to play with, but should really cost a little less, around $[...]."
4,This works okay.,"I used to have a magnetic travel scrabble made in Great Britain. It was so wonderful and I was a little disappointed when I got this one. You just have to stick the letter tiles in the frames. It works well, but I wonder after many plays if they'll loosen. It comes with storage space for the racks so you can continue your play later. It's okay."
2,That's not my weight!,"I purchased this because of the great reviews about Tanita branded scales. However, the only time I got a consistent reading was the first time I stepped on the scale and it gave me the same weight twice. But the next problem was that the weight was incorrect! I tried it out for a couple of weeks but I never did receive the correct weight or the same reading after stepping on and off the scale. So unless you like being frustrated with your products, I would suggest finding another scale.Note: I would recommend an Eatsmart scale, which I have been pretty pleased with."
4,Reasonably consistent and fairly accurate,My scale reads a little less than a pound lighter than true but it does so consistently if you stand on it in the same place each time. If you stand too much toward the back of the scale (away from the display) you get less consistent readings. I'd have given it 5 stars if it had been dead on accurate.
1,Great idea if it worked longer then a few months,Worked okay when I got it but then everytime you stepped on it a different weight - off by 7lbs. Couldn't get it to work by following instructions by tapping on top - had lift it by my foot and let it down. A pain - don't buy - as you can see by the other reviews - this scale has a lot of problems. Thanks to Amazon they said send it back and they would credit my acct. Thanks AMAZON -
1,Wish I listened to other reviewers,"I bought this scale for digital accuracy. But the readings fluctuate wildly from one minute to the next. Beautiful scale, but useless. Waste of money. Going back to the old fashioned but more reliable analog variety.Wish I'd listened to the other negative reviews and to a friend who said he has never found a digital scale that worked properly."
4,Nice Accurate Scale,I have tried a lot of scales in my life and I think this is one of the best. It is very accurate and I like the clean look of it as well. Well worth the money
3,Not what I expected from Tanita,"For all of the Tanita reviews I've read, I thought I was getting the Cadillac of scales. While it does weigh me and appears to do so accurately, the on off function (tapping the surface with your foot) doesn't work right anymore. I find myself lifting the front end with my toes and dropping the unit to get it to come on. Then, in other moments, I'll be brushing my teeth and catch it coming on out of the corner of my eye. When I turn to look, it is initializing and displaying an error. No wonder the first battery lasted so little time.With this kind of behavior, this scale is not worth the price."
1,Be Aware!!!,"My scale broke after only 8 months. I tried to get in touch with Tanita to obtain the address of a place where I could take the scale to be repaired. It took the company's customer service a week to return my emails and they never returned any of my calls. Moreover, Tanita does not have any place where you can take your scale to be fixed, all it offers you is to ship your scale back to Tanita, but of course, you have to pay for the shipping. Thus, you are better off buying a new scale."
1,Lack of Quality Control,I recently bought this scale for my family. It arrived damaged and would not operate at all. I contacted the manufacturer who referred me to the seller. The seller replaced the unit but the second one arrived damaged as well. It worked once and then never worked again. I returned that to the seller and requested a refund. It may be accurate; if you get one that works right out of the box. My experience is that I wouldn't give them a third try.
3,Gritty live performance,"The essence of what makes the Williams Brothers is evidenced here. Live performance with no overdubs! What a concept! The passion and the electricity of their performance only magnifies their faith. The live singing and the musicianship is as good as any group, any genre. Don't be put off by the questionable sound quality of this live recording(remember, it was recorded in the 80s, probably using poor equipment). My only gripe is that they didn't do 'I won't let go of my faith' live. Still, I recommend this because of the incredible live performance of the sensational Williams Brothers."
2,Disappointing change in style,"Disappointed with this CD. I only found a couple cuts I enjoyed. Quite different from past CDs, of which I liked Simply Grand the best."
1,Do Not Buy!,"While this product is a very helpful program and it does work correctly under certain conditions. Those conditions require an aged version of flash, and probably will not work with anything higher than WinXP. I tried to install this on a Win Vista machine and it simply never worked. Calls to the tech support number listed are either not answered, or reach a disconnect recording. The website for the software publisher shows that support for this product was discontinued in 2009. I strongly encourage others to find a different product."
5,Next Generation Cordless at a Great Price,Nice phone set to be used with other expandable Philips Cordless telephone Base units.Works great in areas with other wireless interference.Great product at a bargain price!
4,Fun Toy,"My 9 year old loves this toy and plays with it quite a bit. You can re-create scenes from the star wars episode II movie, but you have to buy all the action figures yourself. The big drawback to thistoy is that it doesn't come with any figurines at all."
2,forced obsolescence,the product works great but when I tried to install it on my new computer the server for registration has been removed so this now acts like a 30 day trial not a full program.
2,Mediocre,"A friend of mine suggested I read this collection because she knows I prefer metrical verse. Unfortunately, although many of the poems in this selection are formal, they aren't all that good. The metrical poems are proficient though not deft (one wishes for the music of a Donald Justice or cleverness of an Anthony Hecht), but the poems rarely involve you; the poems seem too much like diary work, which is great for the writer but not so great for others. I am not a poetry critic, but I can say this book isn't what I thought it was going to be. I figured a selected poems would be the best poems by the poet. After reading it, I am not up to reading her life's work to see if they were, in fact, the best."
3,It fits,"The Husky Custom-Fit Rubber Cargo Liner does fit pretty good. However, it's pretty thin and must be tied down to keep from sliding everywhere. Does the job."
2,Required Trimming to Fit,Not a very good quality filter compared to OEM. The paper filter and frame are quite thin. I had to trim the ends so it would not bunch up (allowing air to bypass the filter) in the Acura filter frame. Typical quality control issue. Bosch is not the name it used to be!
3,Chicago Cubs Steering Wheel Cover,This product was really nice quality......the only problem being it didn't fit on my Sisters car steering whell and it was bought as a Birthday gift.....
3,P.A.N Corn Meal is better,"P.a.n Pre Cooked White Corn Meal.is better for arepas, and generally for making the masa you need for tortillas, temales, etc. Why is it better? I have no idea. But my friends and I, many of whom come from all over the Americas, have been getting together to make arepas for brunch on the weekends for years. We've all arrived at the same conclusion, so we used to buy Maseca but now we really only use PAN. The masa it makes isn't as gritty as with Maseca, so you get a soft smooth wonderful warm inner layer but can still get a nice crisp outer shell.... soooo so good."
1,A total turd,"I was foolish enough to see this turd in the theater, based only on the poster (no reviewer would even bother). By the Apache gunship pictured on the poster (there are none in the movie) I assumed this was about a cloned Jesus returning to earth (in which case, they *would* send gunships). I was young at the time and didn't realize that such ""blasphemy"" would never make it to a theater (altho the world does seem much more hostile to Xtianity today). This movie is a total turd but for sheer laffs, it is worth a rental or dollar store purchase."
1,Ahead Of It's Time...And Bad!,"Okay...speaking as a Christian and one of the biggest supporters of fresh and innovative ways to relay the message to modern contemporary society, I cringed from the opening to the conclusion of this film. Not that the idea wasn't an awesome one(Jesus' 1st coming being today instead of 2,000 years ago), it was just so lacking and predictable in the acting and plotting departments.If you're interested in a more potent visualization of what things may've been like if Jesus' had never come until our time...I strongly recommend JOSHUA(Jesus ""returns"" to reconcile Catholics w/t Protestants in a small town and ultimately reinterates His true, salvific purpose in a meeting with the Pope) and HERO: THE ROCK OPERA (a musical, set in a near yet alternate future in which Jesus story is retold in contemporary context only in N.Y., the Roman Empire evolved into I.C.O.N., no churches save the Temple, etc)."
3,The Carol Burnett Show,"The quality of the product is great. The show was good but only 40 minutes long and it wasn't the real show it was little clips. It was mostly the cast taking questions from the audience. I really wanted to see the original show, so I was dissappointed."
2,"not what I expected, very disappointing",I was very disappointed in the content. It was great to see them together but I was looking forward to some of the skits from the show and there were only a few short clips. Mostly questions and answer sessions and the cast joking around.
2,Disappointing content,"This panel discussion with the cast members was interesting, but not what I thought that I was getting. I was thinking that this would include some episodes or long clips, but it didn't. My kids never saw the show, so they weren't able to appreciate the panel discussion. If you're looking for the Carol Burnett show, don't waste your money on this."
1,Disappointed,I was expecting more high lights from the shows. Too much talk and not enough of vintage skits.I will not buy any more.
1,Very Disappointed,"""Very Disappointed"" were the words that were used to describe this DVD.It was a gift for my Mother, who is a huge Carol Burnett fan.The example that she gave me: ""It was the same questions from the audience and Carol's different responses to them. Not what I was hoping to watch."""
2,Not what i expected,Maybe i didn't read what it was about well enough. i wanted a DVD with several different shows on it and all it was was them sitting around talking about the show and some highlights from past shows where Carol comes out and answers the audience's questions. Kinda boring actually.
4,fun,"IZ rules! Go to there site, all the stars have em! hook up any music device and whatch iz's eyes move to the beet, and the color of his nose change to the music. You may even hear him make a comment. (buuuurp!) Or, listen to his own music, or, well, just make your own! Iz is perfect for parties with friends, its pretty cool, and its not just for lil kids. my 6 year old sis likes it, and im almost 13, and I like it."
3,Front rotors (not),"The rotors seem great, just be careful and verify the parts with the mfg. They were labeled as front rotors but when they arrived they are the back ones. It cost too much to ship back so I am eating it."
5,An above-average soundtrack,"This is a suprisingly good CD. It has an interesting mix of songs of artists and some new names that I am sure will catch on in the future. One of the stand-outs is ""(Like A) Hammer to the Heart"" by The Tamperer featuring Maya Days. A throbbing obvious dance-club song, it really is tuneful and fun. It really rivals 'Crazy' as the best song on the album. Watch for The Tamperer AND Maya Days to become bigger in America after succeeding so well in England. Also, if you like them buy their CD from Amazon.com as well...you won't be sorry."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this soudtrack. The best songs are ""One for Sorrow"", The stop remix of ""Crazy"" and ""Sugar"" Buy this Cd today!!!!"
4,"This ""Drives Me Crazy""!","I have not yet purchased this soundtrack and listened to the other songs, but, I do know that Britney Spears' song, ""Drive Me Crazy"" is a hit! I've seen the video on MTV's TRL about a million times and never get tired of hearing it. I love the dance moves, the melodies, the beat, the lyrics....everything! I'm sure this entire CD is wonderful and I look forward to purchasing it soon!!!!"
1,Uhh......,"This cd was not all that good. The only good song on here was Backstreet's ""I Want it that way"" remix. That's a really good song. The other songs were not good. BSB's song was REALLY GOOD unlike the others! KTBSPA! And remember: Backstreet rules!"
3,ANOTHER GOOD L'AMOUR BOOK,"Louis L'Amour is one of my favorite authors, and Mustang Man met my expectations. It all started with Nolan Sackett running for his life when he came across two stranded travlers. One was a beautiful lady named Sylvie who was no sooner rescued by Nolan than she tried to kill him. It turns out that she was meaner than most of the hard western cowboys that he was use to dealing with. Nolan soons meets another pretty girl named Penelope who has a sad story and needs his help. Little did he realize that helping Penelope would put him right back in conflict with Sylvie and her gang of outlaws. In typical Louis L'Amour fashion, he manages to bring the old west to vivid life with a tale of a good strong cowboy, two pretty girls, a lost treasure of gold, and more bad men than you can shake a stick at."
2,not made for normal coffee cups,"not made to hang normal coffee cups, only for the tea cup type can you fit more than 4 cups."
1,Does not hold 8 cups,"I ordered this product because it is similar to an undershelf wine glass holder which I really like. Although it has 8 hooks, it does not hold 8 coffee mugs. I even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks, which would eventually lead to chipping. It barely fit over the cabinet shelf, although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem. Buy this product only if your coffee/tea cups are very small."
2,My baby does not like it,"For me it was a waste of money to buy this hammer. You have to hit something really hard to get a sound out of the toy. When my baby grabs it, he tries to bite it. It's difficult to bite the hammer, so in a few seconds he throws it away. My baby is 9 months old. Perhaps a one year old who is not teething and not interested in biting any more would enjoy banging the furniture with this toy..."
2,Disappointing scanning performance,"This model seems to be a reasonably good, if bulky, printer.However, my primary reasons for buying this model were the scanning functions, and particularly the film/slide scanning features. The performance is really subpar for this use. Both prints and slides end up blurry in scans, even at the highest resolution (which isn't very high). I've thoroughly cleaned the top surface of the glass, but there seems to be some residue on the bottom side, which I can't access to clean.The color accuracy of the scanner is also not good. Slides which have vibrant, exciting color on the light table, produce scanned images which are flat and dull.Finally, the scanning software (MP Navigator) has a very poor interface and makes scanning large numbers of images more tedious than it needs to be."
1,Worst AMZN shipping experience to date,"Unless you want to wait over a month for shipping, I would strongly suggest that you buy this at another retailer. I paid $179.99 but AMZN increased back to the $230's. Don't believe their BS shipping estimates!!!I ordered the Canon 760 in May. After several emails and calls to customer service, it was shipped after approx 3 weeks of placing my order. It was upgraded to ""standard shipping"" which claimed to take 5 to 6 business days. Shipping alone is going to take 3 more weeks because it was mislabeled by the distribution center. Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere...."
3,The last one was better.....,"I bought this CD trusting the comments made by people who bought it, but honestly the last one from Chambao, ""Pokito a Poko"" is better than this one....This is not bad, either."
2,Eh..,"Just so-so. This book gets high reviews in the NYT Review, but I am not quite sure why. I didn't see anything stellar about it."
4,Good book,This was a great book for me to help understand what my wife has been going through the last 9 months.
3,It's alright,"The description said new, but it clearly had been read multiple times. Otherwise, book was in tact. Fast shipment and no problem with the seller."
3,"Helps you make a plan, but prepare for it to go awry","The best review I can give for this book is that it really helped me prepare for the delivery room. Some of the information is a bit short on detail, but it gives you some general information. Reading the section on Cesarian section helped me emotionally prepare for my wife's last-minute surgury. Having this book in my pocket to review was a big help."
1,Men aren't this stupid,"Yet another book that depicts men as completely incapable of the most basic, common sense activities related to being a husband and father. Are men really this stupid? This book does little that can't easily be accomplished with open and honest communication with your spouse (which I know is a lot more difficult during the 9 months of elevated hormone levels)."
1,It didn't work,"I bought one of these for my husband who is, to say the least, not very good at emotional things. He found it condescending and wouldn't read it even though he really needs to follow some of the advice (i.e. He could send out for a pizza instead of me eating cold cereal for dinner because I don't have enough energy for anythng else.)It's well intentioned but the guys who could use this advice probably won't read it."
1,Not all men are this stupid !!!,"One word- Boring!!This book gets bogged down repeatedly with telling men how they are supposed to act and treat their wives. It treats men like they are all insensitive lunkheads who need the book to let them know that their wives are experiencing numerous difficulties and changes, DUH!Ignore this book, and read ""What to expect when you're Expecting"", what your wife is probably reading. Then you'll be more on the ""Same Page""."
1,Terrible book,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I bought this book thinking that it would be about how dad's can help the pregnancy process. But it ended up being a book about putting fears in dads. And it is not inclusive of different types of parenting situations. I didn't think it was helpful at all. In fact, the book ""What to Expect When You Are Expecting"" has a small section in the back for dads. I should have stuck with my instinct and just read that. It was perfect. I wish I could give this back. A million thumbs down."
4,Go to doc/midwife visits...and not look like an idiot,"This book is excellent for providing a survey of ""what's going on"" during your wife's/girlfriend's pregnancy. Each chapter, which basically covers one month of the pregancy, is short enough to actually be able to get through (!) while still touching on all relevant topics. For example, in the labor and delivery chapter, he covers much of the various terms you hear but maybe are confused about (epidural, episitomy, VBAC, etc.), but in a way that doesn't take forever to read. Basically, it will familiarize you with all the key issues of pregnancy in a terse, enjoyable--and sometimes moving--way."
4,Expectant Father,"After reading the reviews for this book, I purchased it for my husband. He doesn't have much time to read, so I wanted to make sure I got one with the most valuable information in it. Although I sometimes have to remind him, he's been reading it diligently, and will often ask questions about what he's read- ""is it true that this month, you're feeling....."" Good starting points for conversations, and many times, the book confirms what I've been telling him about my pregnancy, which he sometimes doesn't always believe from me.... Highly recommended!"
3,"Great Content, Terrible binding","Although I'm only 50 pages in I can confirm the content of this book, like many other reviews state, is full of helpful facts and advice from a male perspective on pregnancy process.What I dislike is that within a few pages the book started to fall apart, with pages slipping out and falling to the ground. The publisher has done a shoddy job of binding (or gluing in fact) this book together which really dampens the whole experience for me. It will be going in the trash once i'm done with it out of necessity, rather than sitting on my book shelf as a helpful reference guide for the future."
1,"Did you have a really, really, hard time in school?","Do you need to take off your shoes to count to eleven? Do you get a headache from thinking too hard when your boss asks you to use the ""alphabetical order""? Is that first question on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" always a stumper?THEN THIS IS THE PERFECT BOOK FOR YOU!"
2,Not so good,"I bought this book for my fiance for Chirstmas after we found out we were expecting. After he told me some of the advice the book gave him I was very surprised. It told him to follow me around like a puppy dog, even to follow me if I want to take a nap. I told him not to read any more of that book and not to follow any more of the advice, unless he wants to me to kick him out of the house."
2,Dated,"My husband bought this book when we found out we were expecting our first 5 months ago. We both feel that the information offered is old, does not typically jive with the current popular pregnancy books (Dr. Sears Pregnancy book, etc), and is not very in depth. It is obviously aimed at men, which is nice, very few pregnancy books are. My feeling is that men who are actually interested in reading a pregnancy book (like my husband was, not all men want or need the nitty gritty) would be better off reading the same book their partner is reading for better continuity of information."
3,"Good information, just a bit long-winded.","OK, I got several books as gifts (new father) and this was one of them. Plenty of great info, but the writing style is dry."
3,Good supplement to other books,"A friend got us this book and What to Expect When You're Expecting when we ""went public"". I felt like The Expectant Father was incomplete in some aspects. While I appreciated reading that another dad was worried about finances and complications with the baby, the author stopped before getting into how to deal with these stressful situations or anything like a solution. For me, it wasn't always enough just to know that someone else had the same concerns while waiting for the birth of the child. As my title says, I think this is a good supplement, but to find real answers about bonding with the baby before it is born and other issues, we turned to other books."
5,Excellent Content & Easy To Read,The book really shows the future father's point of view. I was shocked at how accurate it was discussing what I was going through while my wife was pregnant. Very easy to read.
4,Infortmative and borning,"The book has a lot of relevant information and the author does provide a lot of ""dad-tips"" but it can be really boring and quite a dry read. Expectant dad should read this, but because it's so dry, a lot of guys won't get through the first few chapters."
4,"Good, Helpful, Thorough",I bought this book for my husband when I got pregnant. He said it's been helpful and informative.
4,Great Collection of 80's Hits,"When I saw this advertised on TV I definitely wanted to buy it. Mainly because it has a lot of tracks on it that you don't find on most of the 80's compilations, but yet you do have to suffer through some songs that seem to be on every 80's compilation ever made (like Waiting for a Girl Like You). I rate this 4 instead of 5 because some of the songs were cut from their original recording. Twilight Zone is one of them and also they just have Need You Tonight and not the Mediate part that is at the end of the music video. Still some of the 80's powerhouse artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, & Whitney Houston were not included but yet the likes of Joe Walsh, Robert Plant's The Honeydrippers, & The Moody Blues were."
1,Uh...,"""Butterfly"" and ""Black clouds"" I love listening to. ""Only when I'm drunk"" made me laugh, and, um... everything else no comment."
2,I loved butterfly,"that song was an awesome hip hop jam but the rest stinks! We'll see them on ""where are they now"" along with maroon 5 in a matter of years!"
1,Maybe the worst CD I own!!!,"Crazy Town is a terrible band that never should have gotten a deal in the first place.When I first heard ""Butterfly,"" I immediately loved the song, and in fact, I still do. I also originally thought the song was by Limp Bizkit (a lot of people did), and I was (sadly) a big LB fan at the time, and it would've been my fave song by them. Then I got the album.I hated it instantly. This album is basically WHITE RAP. And bad white rap at that, by a ""Mac Daddy"" who does no more than brag of his prowess with women (yay for him). The only song I got into even a little was ""Revolving Door,"" like the title sounds, a playa's anthem, and even that song admittedly was pretty bad.This album is awful. Stay away from it!"
1,Not GOOD....,"ok, this is probably the worst rock band out in the business, i mean if u are a heavy metal fan and just listen to hard rock , u will NOT like this album, crazytown is to much of hip hop, it sounds bad how they try to make it hard, if u like rap and pop music then u will probably like this album, but if u are looking for some good hard rock, then u will waste your money......."
1,Oh God make it stop!,"Crazy Town are the final accomplishment in the past three years of sh!t in music. Amelodic music mashed with idiotic, immature, moronic lyrics that make no sense and are downright degrading and offensive to women everywhere is what these clowns are making. It's sad that rock has sunk to the lowest state ever in 1999. I will forever remember 1999 and 2000 as the worst years in rock music because all that was popular was despicable profanity ridden drivelheads like Limp Bizkit, Eminem, Crazy Town, etc. that literrally are brainwashing the youth of America with mush like this. I'll bet I may be disliked by peers because of the negative reviews I wrote on many popular rock bands today but I don't bow to trends and I listen to whatever is real music and not moronic garbage like this."
3,Censored,Bought the album outa nostalgia. Unfortunately the album is the censored version. I don't mind it but that's something that should be listed clearly.
2,It All Sounds the Same,Crazy Town creates two good tracks (Butterfly and Revolving Door) but the rest of the CD is easily forgettable. Simple as that.
1,A very Biassed Book.,"The author is a shame for my country. He is a very bright intellectual, the problem is that he has been a member of the three main political parties in the last 10 years.Before 1996 he was in the PRI, the main party of Mexico, from 1996 to 1999 whe was in PRD, the leftist party of Mexico, from 2000 to 2002 he was in PAN the opposit party. Actually he is member of Another party a new one.This guy wrote this book as a masterpiece. He is a Genius, educated in Princeton and the Sorbonne.The problem of this book is that is very biassed. When he wrote this book he was in the opposition party and he attack constantly the PRI in this book. Before 1996 when he was a member of the PRI he wrote another book where he praised his party (PRI) in a very obvious way.I don't recommend this book because Jorge Castaneda is very subjective."
3,"Wanted to love it, but the static got to me","The phone has all the features I want (dual handset, answering machine, sleek and simple). After reading the reviews and holding the handset in my hands, I thought it would be the perfect phone.Unfortunately, the handset sound quality was not very good. I heard background static, that seemed louder than the caller's voice. The problem could have been due to the appliances I had in the house, because the other reviews did not mention the static. Unfortunately, I had to return the phone, although I wish I could have experienced the great performance others had mentioned.I have another cordless Uniden phone in the house, and that phone has great sound quality, so I'm surprised to hear the static on the newer TRU 4485."
3,Works well but nightmare to install,"This card works fine but the driver was a nightmare to install. XP recognizes the card but refuse to install the driver. Tried to download the latest driver online but still didn't work. Read in couple forums that you need to flash/update your bios to recognize the driver if your computer is old or your motherboard is a particular brand. Anyhow, finally got it to work.Also, I think one manufactures makes all the SATA RAID cards it just gets re-branded so you might still experience this issue even if you purchase another brand. (I bought two different branded SATA raid PCI cards and they were both made by the same manufactures giving me the same exact driver problems.)"
3,Overrated,"I was anticipating this novel with all the hype it received, and especially since Church Folk was such a big hit! Second Sunday is an overrated novel. The story line is boring and outrageous! Many of the characters could use some spicing up. I was so tired and fed up with her saying the first and last name of the characters over and over again (i.e., Mr. Louis Loomis). Why couldn't she just say ""Brother Loomis?"" Page after page, I've waited for something to blow me away. I've waited to say ""ooh,"" ""ahh,"" but nothing happened. Everything was so predictable. Many times I've had to read sentences over just to get what was said. Because of the sexual connotations, this book is more like a ""contemporary"" Christian fiction, than Christian fiction. Sorry. This novel just doesn't cut it."
2,"No ""More""!","Half of these videos are already on Trace's previous music video collections, however , the newer released videos are great as well, especially ""Arlington"". But I'm still waiting to see the classic releases of ""More"" and ""Don't Lie"" since Trace released his first video hits collection in 2003. To Trace, they may not have been his favorites, but fans like myself and other die hard fans would like to see them added to your next video hits collection. And no... I will not purchase the videos ""More"" and ""Don't Lie"" on iTunes since they have poor quality video downloads anyway! I'll wait for Trace's next video hits DVD release.Speaking of classics, CMT and GAC need to come up with a sister channel for classic country 80's & 90's videos ONLY. That top 20 crap they play all day is getting on my nerves! I'm a country music fan, but you can only stand so much without seeing the same top 20 loop around all the time! And I speak for a lot of those out there who agree with me on that!"
1,What's On It?,"Nowhere does it tell how many videos are on this, which ones they are, song list, running time, or what?How do they expect you to buy it if everything is a mystery?Don't they want to sell it?"
3,Replace existing faucet,This replaced same model that was approx 15 years old at the time of replacement.This control wand on this one started to get stiff in only 1 year.The mounting nut that holds the faucet is much larger than the usual kitchen faucet nut. You may need to buy a large wrench to accommodate it.
2,Not very inspiring,"I am totally and completely disappointed with this album. Being a Kenny Loggins fan for more than 30 years I bought this without a listen, and boy what a mistake. The songs are blah and blase' and not very new sounding at all. Its hard to tell where one ends and the other one begins, and the attempt at being a ""rocker"" falls flat. Most of the tunes sound like material that didnt make the last few albums.Good try but no fung shui."
3,"Close, but no cigar","After trying out many different cordless phones, I thought this would be the winner. I tried out the single-phone version and it seemed very clear, so I went back for the double-phone version (TRU4465-2). Still seemed very clear on our end, BUT we got several comments about how we sounded to people on the other end. My wife said that when I was farther away from the base station antenna, I sounded like I was in a tunnel, but it got better as I got closer to the antenna.I really like the feel, the ringers, the display, and the price of this phone, but I think our condo has too much electrical interference to allow a lower-priced cordless phone like this one to work well."
4,audio bird songs CD,"The CD of bird songs is compatible with the Michigan Birds and can assist in helping identify the most common songs & calls of Michigan.I was a little disappointed that more calls/songs were not on the CD. I was hoping to use the CD to assist in Identifying a few birds that have not been spotted in the upper canopy of northern Michigans swamp/river areas but can be heard singing at dusk in the tree tops.Overall, the book & CD are useful and I would recommend them to anyone wanting to put a ""name"" with a voice."
1,WARNING: Same book as The Art of Emotional Healing,"This is the same exact book as the more popular ""The Art of Emotional Healing"", which was published in 2006 (several years later), and unfortunately has an entirely new ISBN so there's no way to know they're the same book except for seeing the table of contents are the exact same. Amazon has no way of knowing it's the same book. Also, Amazon has this documented as a 400 page book (yet more confusion) and yet the table of contents shows only ~250. I hope all this was a minor oversight by the publisher and not done deliberately. The publishers apparently changed between editions, so I'd imagine that's why. Seems screwy, to not make it at least somewhat clear that it's the same book.Get ""The Art of Emotional Healing"" instead."
3,Functional but poor use of technology,Yes this unit works are advertised but the service needs work. The Traffic Network people them selves have several issues to resolve.1) Construction zones listed are incomplete or not up to date.2) Traffic backups are inconsistent in reporting some are missed while others are listed well after the backup has cleared.3) Traffic accidents are not updated in a timely fashion this makes the service pretty much useless.As stated before the unit itself is not the problem it is the service provider that bites.
4,Highway Hazard Receiver for Garmin GPS,"Works fine in areas covered by the system but a large portion of the U.S. is not covered. Great in L.A.. Useless around Yuma, AZ."
2,Poor quality traffic info,"The antenna itself is great, and it works well with the GPS software, but the Clear Channel traffic info for my area is usually very stale and of only limited use.I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, driving mostly on 680, 280, 101, and 237, where the traffic info is only helpful when there has been a severe accident blocking lanes. It's not particularly helpful for reporting on ""slow traffic"" and the like, but it does attempt this. Yeah, I still plug it in, but I check the radio for a much more reliable traffic reports.Unless the quality of the reporting gets much better, there's no way I'm renewing this service. I'll keep the nuvi, of course, which is great."
2,Compact but under designed,"The unit is nice and compact but cycles off and on (internal thermal protection) when the Ipaq is in use with w/ CF Plus sleeve and Socket low power wlan card, even at room temperature. The Compaq charger does not have this problem."
1,Watch Out!,"My wife purchased this watch for me last Christmas. Four months later it stopped working. Thinking it was a bad battery, I replaced the battery...big mistake. Turns out if you are not an authorized repair shop, the warranty is void if you replace the battery. But then I found out there is NO WARRANTY if the watch is bought from Amazon or eBay! This is because the quality of the product cannot be controled from these companies. If I were you, I would shop someplace else for this watch. BTW, turns out the watch has a broken coil and some sticky stuff according to the authorized repair shop. The battery was good so this damage was done prior to our purchase of the watch."
5,A great video for any child (or adult),"My son will be 2 this month and he has just started liking The Wiggles. Before them he would not sit still long enough to watch anything. He loves these guys, so do I! He has learned so much from them. All kinds of words, dances, and he knows all of their videos and songs. I am not kidding! They are great! We now have 4 of their videos, 1 DVD, and one cassette tape! You won't regret your selection!"
2,Least favorite of all,"We have all of the Wiggles videos and enjoy them all, except this one. It is not nearly as good as the others. It is a little strange especially because of the puppets. The great thing about this video is the ending. You get to see what everyone looks like under their costumes. Overall, this video is not worth the money."
3,Not among their best,"We own six(!) Wiggles videos, and this is probably our least favorite. Well, I suppose I should clarify: the two-year-old in our house enjoys all of them, but her parents faces fill with dread whenever she selects this one.Our biggest complaint: too much Captain Feathersword. We liked him in the previous videos, really we did! But this time there are FAR too many scenes of Captain making faces, Captain singing in a high-pitched voice, Captain falling down, and Captain just generally hamming it up. Yes, he's attempting to be funny, but he quickly becomes quite irritating. The long intro scene to the ""Captain's Magic Buttons"" song is particularly tiresome.Beyond that, the overall video just seems rather dull compared to the others."
2,Not one of the better ones,"My son loves The Wiggles and has for some time. We have bought a lot of their tapes from Australia itself. We had the music CD before we had the DVD to this particular one, and we were disappointed when we saw this. My son does not hardly watch it at all, though he still likes the CD. He is only 4 and he even said ""boring"". He does like the dinosaur amination video but that is because he loves computer animated stuff other than that there are no real dance routines that made the other films so famous. I think we could have invested in saving for the next DVD instead of buying this one :("
5,My fave-um I mean my kids fave so far.......,"Ok I admit it I love the Wiggles!! I love them because my kids love them and I love them because they are wonderful. The music is amazing and fun-they keep the kids entertained and moving. This is not the type of video your kids will sit around and watch, they will be up and dancing from start to end-and so might you!! I recommend this to all parents that want to keep your kids entertained with good music and dancing and great FUN!!"
4,Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party,"My daughter and I love their dances. She especially loves the song ""Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party"", the music is so beautiful. I'm glad I've bought this DVD."
4,Wonderful debut,"If you like Nick Drake, you'll like this album. The songs are hauntingly beautiful. Track 4, Heartbeats, is worth the price of the CD alone, but the rest of the songs are excellent as well. I look forward to his next album."
2,Very disappointing,"Every English major has one writer who is responsible for their journey into the field. I have two: Muriel Spark and Kurt Vonnegut. I am not the kind of guy who walks around pretending to be a writer; I am no writer. I do, however, love to read about what makes writers tick, what inspires them to write. This is one of the reasons I picked up this tiny book--I hoped it would give me some insight. I didn't. The conversations, at times, are interesting. But it wasn't worth the cash I shelled out for the 79 pages. If this had of appeared in a magazine, I would have read it and not whined. If this had appeared in a magazine, I wouldn't have wasted over 10 bucks."
1,sounds like a cell phone,"This is the first time I've ever written a review but feel it is so important because this is one of the worst products we've ever bought. We bought the phones for xmas. Everything on the phones work very well (range, caller ID, phone book, phone page, etc) except that it sounds like you're on a cell phone when you use this phone. One problem is that if you and the caller ever start talking at the same time, it's impossible to hear what the person said so you have to keep saying, ""what was that?"". I've called home and my husband sounds like he's talking on a cell phone - it's not static at all but just unclear. We've heard that from friends and relatives too. Maybe ours is defective but now we're stuck with it and will have to swallow the cost and start looking for a new one...live and learn I guess."
2,"""SKID NO"" Doesnt come close..","On the premise of.. if you can say nothing nice don't say anything.. I'll keep this short..To me this release is SORELY LACKING Direction, Artistry, Motivation.) sounds like a ""Decent BAR BAND"" trying to mimic SKID ROW. NOTHING AT ALL caught my attention, way to contrived, and un-inspired. the title sounds more like a necessity. As they will need a thick skin, if they keep on releasing Pablum such as this..Truthfully.. I had a hard time giving this 2 stars, As I am a fan of Rach, and Dave.. Better luck next time...."
4,Good Job Skids!!,"After the departure of Sebastian Bach a lot of people have turned down this cd before even listening to it....I think they did a good job, I'll give it 4 stars just because I really miss Sebastian, I think that Baz would have been way better and a little bit more acid....but I don't want to despise Solinger, he is a good singer and he did a very good job, I mean, it's not easy to replace Baz and he did it very good in this cd. I saw the Skids performing live last year and they sound great, Solinger looks and sound great too, as well as Varone, and they seem to have a good chemistry between them. The music of Thickskin adapts pretty good to these days music, I mean, they don't sound too old and it's not nu metal either....These guys definitely did well, even though there are a couple of songs really bad, I think we should support them buying the cd and help them keep going."
4,Nice,"For use in Sunday School program. Lovely, artistic, colorful drawings / pictures alongside captivating heart - opening text makes a winner."
4,"It's so nice, I bought it twice (sort of)","I bought the model with the answering machine, and the rest of my family liked it so well, I bought another one (this one with out the answering machine). The phone works remarkably well. I am used to corded phones, and not being limited by wires is great. The sound quality is good, but there are occasional clicks that I and the person I am talking to can hear. Changing the channel seems to help occasionaly--could be interference. All in all, a very good phone."
3,Informational but hard to understand,I found that the book was kind of boring in the begining and almost stoped reading. I was glad I did not after reading the history the book becomes more interasting. The book is very informative but some of the words are hard to understand.
4,They're Pretty Good,"Well basically I bought these earphones today. I mean at first, I was like these sound really bad because the bass just didn't exist. I readjusted it and found out that you have to put them deep in your ear canal. Than heaven came because the noise reduction reduced, but they were uncomfortable. After 5 minutes, it didn't even feel like I had them on! These are actually quite good. I like them. They're a little bulky, but I think these will last me quite long."
4,Not for runners,"I was hoping to use these for running, as other ear buds I've tried fall out of my ears or point the sound the wrong way. However, it's kind of like running while cleaning your ears with a cotton swab. The wires bouncing telescope sound up to the ear buds making a rhythmic thump thump thump in your ears with every foot fall.Other than that, I think they are great, comfortable ear buds. They stay in my ears great and block out the sounds of treadmills and other gym sounds."
4,So far so good,"I purchased these because I was having a hard time finding ear buds that would stay in place with my full face motorcycle helmet on. Seemed one or the other would fall out of my ear at some point on my 23 mile commute. I have had these for a week or so and they have not fallen out once. In fact, the only time they fall out is when I remove the helmet. So they solved a big problem for me. Sound is good too."
3,Sound is good but it is not long lasting,worked for less than 6 months. while it worked the sound was good but the life cycle was too short for me
2,As much fun as a fork stuck in your ear,"I bought these just to try them out for the heck of it, based on the reviews here. Although I own Westone UM2 in-ear monitors and Etymotic ER4s as well, good sounding earbuds for cheap is still something I'm interested in.The bass of these JVC buds is respectable, but the mid-range is harsh and almost painful if you're used to high quality sound. You may find some mixes they sound good with, but I sure didn't find any.Everyone's entitled to an opinion, but I'm hard pressed to imagine what prompted the other positive reviews. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Corporate Espionage ....??,Espionage is a lot wider term when used in corporate world and this book does not cover any part of it. I am a great fan of H. Keith Melton and that was another reason for buying this book. I must say that I was very disappointed to read this book as it fails to deliver the expectations I had from it.This book can be interesting and fun if you are traveling on a long journey but if you are expecting to learn new tactics and know some real experiences about espionage in office... this book is not for you!I will say that this book delivers about 20% of what people will expect from the title on the cover page. This book is really too far from reality.
2,Lasted exactly one winter,"They are warm and comfortable while they last.All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper. The outside of the slipper still looks like new.It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months."
1,Would you like to know what it feels like to have your feet in a vise?,"These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable."
1,Welded the wrong size,"I bought the rack to mount two standard size Dell Servers made for a rack along with two other servers that I already have. I obtained two sets of standard size sliding rails so the Dell servers could slide out if we needed to work on them. When we attempted to install the servers we found that the width of the rack where the server was to be mounted was 17 1\2 inches. It was 1\4 inch too narrow. We called the manufacturer and they confirmed that the rack was too narrow, something that we already knew to be the case or strongly suspected it. After spending the time assembling the rack, we now are taking it apart to send it back.It appears to be the result of a bad weld due to the width not being measured properly by the manufactuer."
4,Does the job,"No complaints about functionality. Instructions were absurdly bad, specifically preventing proper assembly if followed exactly. Assembly was nothing too difficult to figure out once the instructions were discarded. Nice low price. Only comes with enough cage nuts/screws to mount a server or two."
4,JOECORKY,"The actors performances were very good. Both Audio and Video output were good in surround sound and widescreen. However, the story line in my opinion was far too brief. This offering at best is a very short story in a period of this Diva's magnificent talent and personal life. Maria Callas is worth volumes."
1,OOPS!,"Well Ken, guess you kind of blew it huh? Looking at the pathetic reviews here from 2002 I have to wonder do any of you feel any guilt? Even just a little? Well ""Dubya"" followed the advice of this book and now he and Kenny-boy have the blood of over 3000 Americans on their hands. And now this clown has a book about Iran! In the words of a REAL Republican president: There you go again."
2,Where are you standing?,"This book is an interesting read for anyone interested in US foreign policy in the middle east. It contains some pretty extensive information and history on the Islamic gov'ts, as well as providing a good example of why you shouldn't get your information from the perspective of an ex CIA agent. This book offers relevant facts and then draws conclusions that could be picked apart by a first-year philosophy student, in addition to leaving out several important factors and influences within US international policy (which, as it turns out, also didn't get mentioned at home in the media either). The willingness of many to jump on board with this book is indicative of the effectiveness of the north american propaganda system, not of the effectiveness of the argument. I hate to sound so leftist, but please folks, if you want to read about US political history, read Chomsky or Lindqvist."
3,well built but terrible interface and ergonomics,"The Philips DETC phone has great sound quality but a terrible display that is difficult to read in sunlight and use as a phone. The controls are not logical and difficult to understand (press the arrow key down to see the last person who called, then up twice to see the previous callers). The biggest disappointment however is the speaker phone option in which the speaker and microphone are so directional you have to keep passing the phone between you if there's two of you and you're trying to speak to your family on the other end of the phone."
5,What every coach should know about building and maintaining a football program,"Coach Allan Trimble has a 111-9 record and six consecutive Class 6A state championship titles. And his winning list goes on and on...His book is a step by step guide on how to start and maintain a successfull football program.This book covers the I-formation (power running game with a wide open passing attack) and a versatile multiple defensive system. Which, he used to win a 32-2 career playoff record and 25 consecutive playoff victories.This book is very user friendly. Coach Trimble uses tons of pictures and diagrams. If you do not understand what he is talking about, all you have to do is look at the pictures. If you are looking for a play book, here it is. This book is great for youth to college level.If you want to read about another coach that has reached the same level of success, read ""COACHING FOOTBALL SUCCESSFULLY"" BY Bob READE"
4,good,"Very interesting. Alot of insight into the game, but could use a little more explanation on what they are talking about. He starts going into plays and you kinda sit there and scratch your head."
4,Nice squeegee but no wall-mounted holder,"The squeegee is a nice product and performs well. However, the product information on Amazon's site stated ""Includes wall-mounted holder"" but there was no mounting bracket at all. Seems rather misleading."
2,Cleret Squeegee,"Esthetically, it is very appealing. Too bad I can not use it because blades are very thick, not doing the job.Both blades also slide from side to side which makes it more difficult to wipe a shower door without leaving wet trails..and it only works when held at specific angle.."
4,Stylish,"This works very well and is quite stylish. It is a bit large, so it takes up some room but it makes cleaning quicker."
1,CD Player does not work,After a few months the CD player stopped working. If you read the other reviews it seems that many have the same complaint. The system is obviously defective.
2,Not nearly good enough,The write up of the book is detailed and promises a wealth of information regarding the title. A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the book turns out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and unsophisticated review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book. This is the same review I have left for another book by the same author and this is purely because the book is written in the exact same way. I have images of a little old man reminiscing about his past with a quill in his hand and an old scroll laid out next to his inkwell. I would have honestly have preffered something a little more factual and to the point.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Fan stopped working after about 6 uses. Used it 2 hours max each time. Went to turn it on one day and got nothing. Right out of the box one of the lights on the remote wouldn't work. Figured it wasn't a big deal so I didn't send it back. My mistake.
5,Not for every 4160,"I gave the product 5/5 stars because that's what it's worth. It's very high quality.However, the information on the site is poor and I wasted $90 dollars on this product and now have to think of a way to recoup those losses. This base plate is NOT for every 4160 Holley 4bbl. It's only for specific ones. Which ones it's designed for, I have no idea. All I know is that it was the wrong baseplate for my Holley 8007 (390 cfm). I wouldn't have purchased it if this information had been available."
3,"Nice listing of basic works, but 10 years out of date","I should have read the product description more carefully. Had I seen that this book was published in 1999 -- 10 years ago -- I would have not bought the book. It gives a nice listing of works worth considering, but if you want more up-to-date listings of recordings, you'll need to buy the Penguin Guide, The Grammophone Guide, or both."
1,Totally commercial,"This music was made for making lot's of money. That is obvious. Although it is perfectly produced, you got to take a closer look. I always wondered why people liked it so much. The singer absolutely can't sing. He hardly ever pitches the note, sings flat and without any emotion or vibrato in his voice. This is disgusting to me. And the music is boring. Slick stuff for Yuppies.But I guess if music is that perfectly produced, people just take it as a gentle elevator/toilet muzak (which is noise to me).""Come, for my burden is light. You don't have to think much."" Yeshua, Essene teacher (aka Jesus)."
2,A LITTLE OFF,"I'm not a George Winston basher, Autumn and December are cornerstones in my collection. I was put off by this one - it didn't touch me the way previous recordings did. Seemed filled with commercialism rather than emotion."
3,"Devoted Winston, Windham listener finds Plains rather plain","George Winston's latest effort, Plains, offers no serious departure from his previous releases. It is enjoyable music and, to those unfamiliar with Winston, is a good representation of his catalogue of work. The music is melodic but emotionally neutral. With the exception of cuts like Dubuque, Before Barbed Wire, and Cloudburst most of the selections are remeniscent of lullabys or the tranquil music you might hear played prior to a funeral. Good for meditation or insomnia but not particularly inspiring. In truth the compliation on the bonus CD that comes with the Limited Edition package is, in many ways, as or more enjoyable.If you are looking for music that reflects the spirit and ""moods"" of the plains I recommend Philip Aaberg's 1985 release (on Windham Hill) called ""High Plains."" It is superb and, unlike Winston, Aaberg is not overpublished and, therefore, somewhat unique in content and style."
5,"""Plains"" - George Winston stretches to the horizon!","Being a long time fan of George Winston probably biases me against being overly critical. But after listening to this CD several times, I only am left with how truly enjoyable this CD is. He has a knack of capturing the sensibility of the plains and the people who live there without falling into cliche, or becoming so abstract that the theme is irrelevent. The extra tracks of his solo guitar work is a treat (although not surprising in light of his musical perfection at the piano). This seems to be a new adventure for him and I will be looking for future works on this instrument from him as well. I have all of his solo piano music and rank this amongst the highest in the collection. For die-hard fans and new discoverers of George Winston alike, I believe this will become one of your favorites, too."
4,Love It,"The Good: is nice and form fitting, warm, easy to put on, supports those with big bellies and sore backs.The Bad: it smells funny initially, it can get hot to wear in warmer climates, it isn't the easiest to wash since it can't be machine washed, it stretches out and loses firmness over time, it holds a lot of dirt and odor so owning more than one is a better idea.Bottom Line: The Bad is tolerable since it is a major relief for my back and slims my gutt down pretty good"
3,Useful to a point......,"This guide has good basic info. However, we sometimes wondered what Costa Rica the author visited, i.e., ..""If you're a coffee drinker, you might be disappointed here."" ...""Ticos tend to prefer theirs weak..."" What?!?! In all of our trips to Costa Rica, we have never had a bad cup of coffee. We prefer small local sodas and restaraunts, and have found the coffee to be excellent, strong but not over-roasted in flavor. Also a lot of significant places to stay are omitted, for example, Hotel del Sur in San Isidro and Costa Paraiso and The Coconut Grove, both in Dominical/Dominicalito. A guide worth taking, but, don't assume that it is too comprehensive."
3,Fromers is Fromers,"They do a good job of cataloging the main options is every local. It has been helpful with my research. I work in the travel industry, I have never gone wrong with a Frommers guide book."
3,Digital Spread What? Who? How?,"...I shopped around and found that the uniden tru-446 looked to be a good deal at [$$$] for a ""digital spread spectrum"" (DSS) phone [local store].The research i went through indicated that the DSS technology was capable of transmitting 4-5 times farther than your basic analog or ""plain"" digital cordless... [The phone] picks up no better. Works okay otherwise i believe. Looks okay, feels okay. Feels solid. But don't bet on DSS solving your transmission problems over longer distances."
1,Moisture gets in,"I mounted this product outside, powered it up before winter and it stopped switching after 5 months. It is now on regardless of ambient light level. Opened it and there is moisture accumulation.Although they placed a good amount of silicon caulk on the wire side of the assembly, the eye window is poorly glued to the case, and that allows moisture to settle in."
3,Average,"Like the TV but it is difficult to get the color and brightness adjusted to where it is acceptable. The remote should have a display key and one to return to the previous channel rather than have to push the numbers each time. The DVD works ok. If I had it to do over again, would look for a different make or model."
2,Was satisfactory until it broke.,"We've had this thing for a couple years now. We've used it in our kitchen, and in the car on longer trips. Picture was good enough for the kids. Sound is OK for such tiny speakers.The functions could be a little simpler. Would like a ""previous channel"" button on the remote.Major problem is it just stopped working. The DVD was stuck in it. It wouldn't play or eject. It was a rental and due back, so I took the thing apart to get the DVD out. It wouldn't let another dVD go in after reassembly.Tech support was no help. They wanted me to ship it back to them. It's probably not worth messing with it.For the price, I wouldv'e expected higher quality.I'll probably buy a Sony or other higher end brand this time."
