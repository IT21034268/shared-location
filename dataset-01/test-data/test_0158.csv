3,"Women and Jewish Law: The Essential Texts, Their History, and Their Relevance for Today","I felt that the reference to ""today"" was sometimes out of date. Otherwise, I found it to be a good review of the women in Jewish law. Hopefully, another writer will take another look at the subject as it is viewed since women have taken a larger roll among rabbis. Good read for someone with very little knowledge for Judaism."
1,Absolute disappointment,"This was one of the worst novels I've ever read. Especially so because every other McBain book has been worth the reading time invested--particularly his 87th Precinct books. This book was like a bad first draft from an unpublished writer. The characters were boring and one dimensional, the plot was predictable, the cops were typical. There was a whole section of sex that served no purpose whatsoever and so much arbitrary background data that I skimmed over a ton of it. I don't know what happened to Mr. McBain with this book, but it was sure a disappointment."
3,Very predictable,"Since the book's first part you'll know who snatched the kids. So that makes the book a little bit boring and disappointing at the end when you read what you already knew. The story has too many characters and stories that doesn't have to be there, for example:Rafe and his girlfriend.Alice's run over.The FBI implication.And the press implication among others.In spite of the above points you can read the book and have a fairly good time reading it albeit is not a good thriller"
2,Big disappointment,"There's the usual snappy dialogue, and this is certainly an easy read, but I just didn't like this book. I never believed in Alice, and the identity of the villain is blindingly obvious. What I found particularly distasteful were two long descriptions of Alice's methods of contraception, just dropped into the narrative for no particular reason. What on earth is McBain up to here? Is this supposed to be an insight into the female mind, or what? I just found it creepy. In fact the whole book is slightly creepy."
2,Not satisfied,"I found this book superficial. I bought it to learn how to kitesurf but the section was only about 40 pages without much technical details. The other sections are about land, snow, etc... Also to much about the history of kiting which in my opinion shouldn't take this many pages in a technical manual. 'The ""ultimate"" book of power kiting and kiteboarding', not really. I returned the book the same day, and looked for a better one."
2,"Makes ""Time-Out-Time"" FUN! That's so not the point of it!!!","Very cute, but not for it's purpose! You're not supposed to make time-out-time fun!!! That's the whole point! It's supposed to be miserable and boring! How is a child supposed to learn a lesson by having fun in the corner as a result of being on thier bad behavior! I receied this cushion as a gift and thought it was cute until I found out what it was for. My daughter wanted to play on this.... how awful! She would say...""Momma...I wanna play on the naughty seat"" It's almost as if she was about to do something naughty so that she could play on it... Moms...get a reality check!"
3,More luke warm at this point.,"Honestly this is really a good album. I think it just gets fewer stars when compared to their other albums. Truth be known I like their 80's material alot more than their 90's stuff, but of the first four albums, this is the weakest. Despite that, still some typical and killer tracks. ""True Men Don't Kill Coyotes"" is classic. ""Get Up And Jump"" is also aggressive and fun, as is ""Green Heaven"". The slower, maybe groovier moments come with ""Why Don't You Love Me"" and ""Mommy Where's Daddy"", both easy to like. The demos are decent, but the remastering is the bigger plus. Overall it's no ""Uplift Mofo Party Plan"", but it's a start."
5,Cool,This product was shipped in a timely fashion and came as described in the listing. I was very satisfied with the product.
5,great,recived it long before the date promised and is in great shape even for a used version you would never know! thanks
3,i don't like this movie a bit except its beautiful scenery settings,"the dialogue actually sucks, so staged and so unnatural. and the girl is such an unlikable, annoying, plain-to-death person, fed with lot of adult sentences that were so unnatural and so...john wayne looked totally spent and old in this movie, but he played well. this western looked a bit pretentious and all the dialogue and the soundtrack are so disturbingly annoying."
1,"I disagree, this is one of John Wayne's worst showings.",I have many of Duke's classics in my library and enjoy them each and every time they are played. This is not one to add to my library.
5,Great Movie!,I have two boys that love cowboy movies. We have seen most John Wayne movies but hadn't seen this one. We wanted to watch to original version before going to the movies to see the new one. Well worth the purchase. The entire family enjoyed this classic.
5,"""True Grit""-1969-John Wayne-Blu-Ray","The quality of the video and audio is outstanding,and the bonus features are excellant.I have never seen the original 1969 movie version of ""True Grit"" look and sound this perfect like it does in the BLU-RAY format,high marks go to Paramount Home Video for a very high quality top notch transfer,I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,kim darby is wonderfull!!!,"a great western, a great movie. kim darby is excellent and lovable. highly recommended."
5,THE DUKE AT HIS AWARD WINNING BEST,IT TOOK HOLLYWOOD LONG ENOUGH BUT THEY FINALLY REALIZED THIS MAN COULD ACT!!! JOHN WAYNES' PORTRIAL OF ROOSTER COGBURN WAS AS RIGHT AS RAIN !!! THE DUKE WITH A SUPPORTING CAST OF ROBERT(LONESOME DOVE)DUVAL AND SINGER GLEN CAMPBELL IN HIS FIRST ACTING ROLE AND KIM DARBY WERE AS NATURAL AS COULD BE . THEY ALL COMPLIMENTED THIS FILM AND EACH OTHER .THE EXCITING SHOWDOWN BETWEEN COGBURN AND LUCKY NED PEPPER WILL HAVE YOU CHEERING IN YOUR SEATS . A MUST SEE FOR EVERY WESTERN FAN !
2,Where is the old model?,These new clippers with the cross pattern on them are cheap. They don't seem to cut very well. I like Revlon nail products but this line is not really up to par
3,Fiesta,"This is a deceiving movie. I bought the one with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban, they are both listed on the cover of the movie box. Neither one is in the movie.Even when the title is the same, this is totally different movie. This was made in 1940, the one with Esther Williams is from 1947.I got this title from the Esther Williams movie list, but what I got is not what I wanted.This movie should not be listed under Esther Williams list, even the picture to advertise it is wrong, it shows Esther, but the actress there is Anne Ayers instead. Amazon you should correct the error on its page."
1,Fiesta DVD does not have actor Esther Williams as stated,I wanted a movie with actor Esther Williams and this movie does not have Esther Williams. I purchased for my father a Esther Williams fan and he did not like the movie & was very disappointed. Please change your advertisement and let me know if you find the correct Fiesta movie with Esther Williams.
3,gifts for my grandson's birthday,The hardy books and dvd are for my grndson's birthday this sat.sorry I can not give a review at this time :-(
5,Arrived in Good Condition,Arrived promptly and in good condition. I shipped these directly to my mother whom tells me the spice is very good.
5,The Winans' first and best album.,"I enjoy hearing the siblings Bebe and Cece Winans perform and this album IS ""Heaven,"" No doubt about it!"
2,This must be a scanned version of Einstein's writings,"This must be a purely scanned version of Einstein's writings in the public domain with zero proof reading on the publishers part! I have rarely seen so many errors that are obviously printer/scanning errors, that should have been caught by an editor, average about two errors per page. Where the word should be ""in"" they use ""m"", they use odd symbols for the letters ""ae"" and other oddball things. It is kind of like reading Einstein's work and working a crossword puzzle at the same time as you have to figure out two puzzle per page! This book, the work of the great man, due to the bad errors is worth maybe two bucks tops....no photos, no subject index, scores of errors that should have been editorially caught."
5,A must listen!!!,"Memories, memories..... I played this when I lived in Chicago a lot. This is just a str8 up fun nothing deep or to debate about album. The songs have good story telling (ex. ""Not your Puppet"" or 2 Drunk 2 F**k)that will have u buggin out. The whole posse is on this album: 2nd11None, AMG and Quik. Songs like ""2 ada time"" and ""Bullsh*it"" are some of my favorites.This is the west coast I think a lot of people 4get about from back in the day. But these boys put out some of there best albums in that '90-'93 era. This is just one mc (Hi-C) and his Dj (Tony A). This is a west coast throwback every fan of the west should have. Hotep!!!"
5,History,"I thought this was an excellent idea for all those who were affected by 9/11 and wanted to never forget how the nation was united. We stood in shock at such a castrophe and horrendous action, but instead of standing apart we stood together as a nation; putting religion, race, and political views aside. Six years later, here we are still fighting the war on an enemy that has no face only hate- hate not just for Americans but anyone outside their beliefs."
2,Slick and Self-Promoting,"The pictures in this book are collected from some of the best professionals in the business along with photos from talented amateurs. Sadly these are all packaged in a slick/arty coffee table tome that makes the event feel like another Hollywood product, one image after the next. The only words in the book are saved for the organisers to talk about themselves and how popular their effort to sell photos of the event has been (and the celebrities who came to visit). As the ""New York Times"" book reviewer said, it would be great to be able to rip the photos out of the book and present them in a much simpler and more honest format."
4,NICE COMPILATION,"This a is a good sampling of Grand Funk's catalog, though I would have included two more songs,,""Aimless Lady,"" and ""I Don't Have To Sing The Blues.""I love the Capitol Collector's Series format and I own several of them, but why do they always feel the need to inlude studio chatter at the beginning of some of the songs? They do it on two songs in this set and it distracts from the enjoyment of the songs.But, overall, it's a great CD by one of the finest Rock bands of the 70's."
1,Beautiful Lemon,"The watch is much better looking than in the picture. The blue is darker, almost purple, and the triangular number markings are copper color. Looks fantastic! Unfortunately the watch is junk. The first one stopped working after a couple weeks of wearing. Amazon replaced it but the second one was dead on arrival. The self winding mechanism was frozen. Additionally the hands do not glow in the dark, at least enough so that you can read them! I would not recommend buying this model."
4,"Overall, I was fairly happy with this product. ...","Overall, I was fairly happy with this product. The foam piece on the bottom part of the curler made it very gentle. I was thrilled that a replacement foam piece was included in the package. This curler didn't curl my lashes as well as others that I've used in the past, but I assume that it's because it was designed to be gentler on the lashes. I'd recommend this product to others."
1,BEWARE!,"This is the worst recording of anything I have EVER heard! The quality is poor, the selection is poor, and it is an insult to two very talented people. I wouldn't even have it in my house and I promptly returned it! Everything else I have ordered from Amazon has been exceptionally good but, NOT this item!"
1,Sonic Rivals not fun,"Older guy rating a kids game so consider that with my review. But, I didn't get this game at all. So, this one's for kids only."
3,Ehhh...,"Sonic Rivals was one of the first games I got for my PSP. It's fun when you start, and it's pretty cool collecting cards, but then it gets really boring and repetitive. I always try to collect new cards, but I always get the same cards. And the roster is also sort of boring. Silver, Sonic, and Shadow are fast (obviously) and Knuckles is the slowest, that's all there is to know. The only character I like is Metal Sonic. The storyline is also very boring, just people chasing Eggman Nega and Eggman. That's not a big deal, though, because I don't buy video games to read them. I would recommend this game to (maybe) have on the go, but not to play at home or something. Just something to do when you're bored."
2,Read Phantoms instead,"I read Phantoms in the Brain by the same author and was wowed, so I bought this book and was sorely disappointed that it really really is a shorter, less interesting version of Phantoms in the Brain. Don't waste your time on this book just buy Phantoms in the Brain. I wish I had read the other reviews earlier that said this before I ordered it!"
2,"""Phantoms"" for Dummies","If you haven't read Ramachandran's ""Phantoms in the Brain,"" go read that instead--it's amazing. If you've already read ""Phantoms,"" don't bother with this lightweight re-hashing.Ramachandran seems to have chosen to follow in the footsteps of another great--Stephen Hawking--by writing one great book and following it up with an endless stream of successively shorter, ""more accessible"" versions of the same book.The attempts to make more accessible that which was already readily accessible have put Ramachandran in danger of over-simplifying the material.Warning: This allegedly 208-page book includes only 113 pages of ""Phantom"" rehash and then notes."
1,A Phantoms in the Brain reiteration,"For those of you who read ""Phantoms in the Brain"" one word of advice: Don't buy this book. The book's title is misleading as it does not bring new ideas about consciousness but it is a compendium of Dr. Ramachandran's ideas already exposed in his earlier book. The book has 190 pages out of which 78 are notes!!What happened here? Was this motivated by his publisher or agent? I expected more!"
3,A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness : From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbe,"Good idea; nice try, but...1. A little too ""gee, I'm just a genius trying make things understandable to the plebeians"".2. Bi-, Tri- or even quadra-cultural references and critiques are fine, but V.S.R. seems to have some difficulty making them relevant to his points.3. Most of the examples he drags up are well known to those of us who habitually consume books of this genre.4. And by the way, is it news that Victorian Englishman were just a bit provincial and egocentric in their world view?5. But, I do like his presentation of Parvathi!John Seals, M.D."
5,Revlon Tweezers,"I bought these tweezers years ago and they are very hard to find now, you can not find them in any stores! I was recently in Florida with my mother and she used mine and wanted to know if I would be able to find it for her so I went into Amazon.com and there they were. She was so happy to have them because they really do work well. I wish Revlon would put them back in the stores so it other people can see how great these tweezers really are."
4,Very well made. Tip matched up very well. ...,"Very well made. Tip matched up very well. Good size, easy to use. I'd recommend this product to anyone needing tweezers."
5,Children will learn the first steps to gaining new knowledge,"I recently read ""The Wise Woman and Her Secret"" after talking to our school children about the art of ""wondering"". We are often told new information by others, however, it is more important that we gain new knowledge by way of our own wondering. Eve Merriam helps us to gain an appreciation for this art by telling this beautiful story. Those who rush through life don't get the chance to wonder. Those who slow down and pick up pennies, or seashells find lots to wonder about and even more to learn. The old woman and the young girl have this gift. One knows that it is a gift and not really a secret, while the other simply enjoys herself and the world around her. Every child and parent should read this story. It will help to pave the way towards a successful life-long learning experience for both."
4,Photocopy?,"I am pleased with the treatment of the topic by the author. This book takes a non-judgmental approach to gender issues, and the reader is encouraged to look into his or her own life more critically.However, I am not pleased with the quality of the print itself. It seems to be a professionally bound photocopy of the original textbook. The text and images are a bit grainy, indicative of a second-generation image. People with disabilities would possibly find it more difficult to read due to lack of clarity.Overall, it is a useful book and an affordable option for students."
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered three of these items. The item was not the one shown the product description. It was a much cheaper clipper. I'm not satisfied.
4,Camano Island is Smooth!,"Tony Gable has not received the praise he deserves. If you like Earl Klugh, take a listen to Camano Island. I have always considered this to be Tony's best work. The sound is very smooth!"
3,Enjoyable mixture,"I was a tad bit disappointed in this disc, after hearing disc 1. If the premise was to correlate with the CWG books, I would expect very little vocal and more instrumental. I did not like the vocals on this disc and really felt that it detracted from the rest of the disc. I wanted to be relaxed, in a meditative state and the vocals seemed to distract from that ambiant mood. I felt that the vocal tracks really had nothing at all to do with the tone of the disc.This is not a disc to relax to, but rather, to enjoy the wonderful music of the various artists of Windham Hill.Since the CWG books stand alone, I would expect more of a meditative, contemplative disc, as one found with disc 1. The very few vocals on disc 1 were subtle and blended perfectly with the intrumental moods. But disc 2 is more distracting to me and I felt that the disc could do without the vocals or they could have been as subtle in the first disc."
3,Not as good as volume 1,Is anything really as good as the first?I wasn't thrilled with this CD as much as I was with the first CD.The first CD is AWESOME ! ! ! !The books are AWESOME ! ! ! !This CD is GOOD ! ! !
5,"it's Drake Bell, nothing more to say",Drake's performance was amazing. I enjoyed the in between videos where Drake is interviewed. The compliation for songs on the video are all of his best too. You won't be disappointed.
2,What a waste of a tree........,"This book is not worth the time it takes to read it. It is just simply put, too unbelievable to make any sense. I think Ms. Clark must have decided her readers are morons and decided to just throw a lot of nonsense in a blender and then pour it onto pages.The lead character, Celia, has to be about the most simple minded fool to ever have made it to print and all the rest of the characters are just plain boring. It had no suspense to it because you really can figure out who the villian is before the 2nd chapter, even with the growing dementia that MHC is sure we all suffer from. Save your time, save your money and say a prayer that Mary Higgins Clark is in a slump. Otherwise I would say her career as a brilliant mystery writer is just about over."
2,Not the worst,"Well I have to agree with E. Varghese-Kroll that the so-called ""twist"" ending was telegraphed from a mile away. I knew within the first couple chapters who the villian would be just from having read other novels by Mary Higgins Clark.But even though I knew who the villian was it was still a fairly light and easy read to find out how the others got there too. And being a New Jersey resident I did enjoy the local color of the setting.But if you had read others novels by the same author I doubt the ending will be any surprise. Even if you have *not* read other books by her it's not really much of a surprise. :-)"
2,eh?,it was alright nothing crazy. very easy to figure out what is goign to happen .. i wouldnt waste my time
1,Great read,I really do not like writing reviews. Why do they require this ? Why can't this be bypassed if I don't WANT to do this
3,"Reads quick, but predictable","I enjoyed how quick this read and the character development. The basic concept behind the story was interesting: how and when to share our pasts. It did become a little predictable, which led me to three stars instead of four."
2,I'm SO dissapointed,"This was the first time that I found myself tempted to abandon a book midway. Is it just me, or did this work of MHC come across as boring, mechanical, and just plain uninspired? I have read and loved most of MHC's earlier works, but this one read more like a hastily thrown together newspaper story. I especially found the scene where the landscaper is supposedly mulling over his situation ( where he had to buy another cell phone), to be redundant, boring, and begging to be weeded out of the manuscript. I agree with the other review I just read. Please, MHC, you're killing me."
3,"Good, But Predictable","I've read all Clark's books and I needed a quick read for the weekend. Okay, but not great."
3,Excellent reading but poor plot,"The theme for murders in this very well written novel is greed, and to some extent lust. However there are apparently two disconnected teams of murderers and it is strange to find out at the end that there is one person common to both teams."
2,"Good storyline, disappointing style.","I like Ms Clark's work, and have tried to read all her mysteries. This book, however, doesn't match her previous compositions. It almost reads like a first novel. The paragraph structure is weaker than previous books, although the story line is a good one."
4,A solid story...,"Mary Higgins Clark is an excellent mystery writer. Her use of flashback writing always brings the reader a strong connection to the main character. This novel is no exception. Here the main character Celia lives in fear that her true identity will be found out. She struggles to remember what happened the night that she accidentally killed her mother and injured her stepfather. This struggle allows the reader to sympathize with Celia, and immediately draws the reader into the mystery of what really happened. Although the character keeps most people at arms length, her obvious devotion to her family comes through in this story."
4,Feels Like Home Again,"MHC used to be my favorite author, but then the last several books of hers seemed to have been writen by someone else. When I saw her latest, I hesitated only because I've been left disappointed in the past. I actually read through the first several pages at the bookstore ... just in case. Right off the bat, No Place Like Home felt like a MHC book. The old MHC. Not the MHC who wrote Nightime is My Time or Daddy's Little Girl. (Those poor trees!) I'm thoroughly enjoying this book, despite its having several coincidental occasions (that's why there's only 4 stars, as opposed to 5). I don't mind suspending belief for a time because MHC has managed to sprinke some of her old magic through the book. Fans of MHC will enjoy this one."
2,Will the real author please stand up?,"Not your typical good novel by MHC. It is more along the bad writing style of boring and ridiculous of that of her daughter Carol Higgins Clark. I am a true fan of Mary Higgins Clark, have the hardcover editions of every book she has ever written. Read a CHC book and then read one of the few really poor ones of MHC and there is a definite similarity in poor writing. The daughter has even tried her hand at acting in the made for TV movies of her mother's novels and that too is equally bad. For me, I can't help but think CHC is ""assisting"" in the writing that is having mom's name penned because it would be a definite sell. The Queen of Suspense has only disappointed me a few times over the years with a bad book, this being one. I could only recommend this book for a true collector to put on the shelf to complete a collection, but definitely not worth the time or effort to read."
2,please make it end!,I have read about 75% of this book and just can't motivate myself to get to the end. This may be one of the most boring books I've ever read. Sorry MHC - you're killing me.
4,Come Sail Away,"Are there other better ""best ofs"" when it comes to Styx? Absolutely, which renders this 20th Century Masters Millennium Collection an unnecessary ""best of"". But that doesn't mean that this is a bad or unworthy collection. The sound value is quite high and, with a couple of absent songs (most notably ""Lady"", how'd they miss that one?), the song selection is a great representation of their best (but I question the ordering of the CD). Now, if they would have omitted my favorite Styx song (""Come Sail Away"") you'd be reading an entirely different review."
1,Like New- NOT AT ALL! Well Used! Is the proper description,"The CD arrived in a paper envelope. The CD was advertised as LIKE NEW. Its used, the CD is scratched and the case has numerous cracks in it and doesn't event stay closed. Again, its just false advertising and misleading product description. Yes that clicking sound during the first song is not the band, but a scracth. I wouldn't give this to my own mother. I would never buy from this site again for anything other than NEW. Please avoid this seller and this site."
5,One hot Romani,"This is one awesome figure/statue of Faye. Very nice sculpt and detail. Highly recommended for any Bebop fan. My only complaint is that the deck of cards (if that's what they are since they're totally blank) don't fit very well if at all in her hands. Also, the one I got has purple stockings as opposed to the flesh-colored ones in the picture. Other than that it's terrific!"
2,A sycophant to the rich and the flatulent.,"What a piece of name dropping puff pastry this book is. Despite the recipes peppered throughout the book don't expect to have a greater understanding of food and wine after having read the book. But I guess food and wine is realy not the point of Le Cirque but clearly who sits where and with whom is. I lived in New York throughout the eighties, ate out two or three time a week, and in my circle of foodies Le Cirque was considered a joke. Reading this book only reinforces this view. I remember reading Ruth Reichl's review and thinking ""there, told you so."" Mr. Maccioni is clearly a clever businessman, and the book details who his clients are. Unfortunately having read the book I still don't want to eat in his restaurant."
2,Imagine,"I do not really like John Lennon singing. I only bought the CD for the only song I like, which is Imagine."
2,"fairy tales, not SF","I didn't like it.I am unfamiliar with the rest of this Author's work, so I can't tell you whether it is like her novels or not, but when I judge this work by itself I find it wanting.This is a rather long collection of rather short stories. Most of these have not been published elsewhere. The norm for the SF field is for single author anthologies to be composed mostly if not completely of previously published work. Take this as a warning that you may not be getting what you expected.The stories seem to follow a very common and uninteresting fairy tale format. Fairy tales can be made interesting-- for instance Italo Calvino's Italian Folk Tales. These were not.As a point of reference, I favor ""literate"" SF. Some of my favorite authors are Kim Stanley Robinson, Gene Wolfe, Ursula LeGuin, Bruce Sterling, Thomas Disch, early Larry Niven..."
5,Great Bob Seger CD But One Flaw!,"The songs on this cd are great, but there is one problem! Very few of these song are with""The Silver Bullet Band""! Just ain't the same without them! The cover of Ike & Tina Turner ""Nutbush City Limits"" Kicks ass!It is much better than the original! Don't be a beautiful loser go get this cd!"
2,The Wussy Album,"I love classic rock. I love Bob Seger. This album sucked. When I first picked it up I got excited because Katmandu & Travlin' Man were on the same album. When I got home and listened to it I was dismayed by the incrediblely slow pace of Travlin' Man. Where's the Silver Bullet Band? The weakness began with Beautiful Loser (still a heck of a good song). Katmandu is vintage. This is where the good times stop rolling unfortunately. Travlin' Man fails to enlighten me on Seger's ""wealthy soul""; and the refrain is downright wussy! They would never play that kinda stuff on the radio. I'm sorry I got stuck with it."
3,Not A Loser,"Beautiful Loser was the album that set the stage for Bob Seger's breakthrough. It is a decent collection of rockers from the Midwesterner. The title track is a strong number as is another ode to the road ""Travelin' Man"". ""Katmandu"" is the highlight of the album and became well known for usage in the film Mask."
4,"Good mix of songs, even if they aren't all edgy","This may be the first album where some critics accused Bonnie of ""going soft"" and losing her edge - the album where she went mainstream in order to sell albums. Some songs, like ""Nick of Time"" and ""Have a Heart,"" are quite soft, but they are undeniably catchy. Other songs are funkier or more bluesy - ""Thing Called Love,"" ""Love Letter,"" ""Real Man,"" and ""The Road's My Middle Name."" Most of the others are less remarkable, but the only one I don't like is ""I Ain't Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again"" - it might be stripped-down and emotional, but it's no ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" (which is from Luck of the Draw - an even better album).Like another reviewer says, it has a mix of some good music and some music ""made for the supermarket"" - but, hell, some of them are damn good ""supermarket"" songs. One thing I must say is that the album does not just sound all the same, unlike so many albums I've listened to recently. And as always, her voice is amazing."
5,Hilarious,"This is a great book; extremely funny with great characters. You will love Jamie and her pals as they explore Las Vegas and hit the big-time. A really excellent, beach novel - if you like British ""Chick-Lit"" you will not be disappointed."
4,Good for small jobs,"Most recently we used this product on a smelly, slow draining kitchen sink. Initially we used it on the garbage disposal side. Didn't work. Then we used it on the other side of the sink. This time it worked like a charm.One time, there was a major clog. The product didn't work, but neither did the first plumber we called. The second one (or main guy who had been on vacation) was able to unclog."
2,Not Good for Hair Clogs,Our bath tub got a bit clogged mainly due to hair accumulation. Did not help at all after several applications.Then only we realized that this enzyme-based cleaner is probably NOT SUPPOSED to dissolve hair!It may very well work for clogs due to accumulation of easily bio-degradable things like food scraps.
5,This album is their best!,"Of all the Beastie Boy's CD's, this is their best. It has a huge variety of style compressed into this 15-track disk. In my opinion, To All The Girls, Egg Man, The Sounds Of Science, and 5-Piece Chicken Dinner are some of the best songs they've ever done. It's pretty damn lucky they got to put all those creative samples on it. Any B Boys fan has to get Paul's Boutique."
2,This is the WORST album the Beastie Boys have done!,"I love the Beasties, and have 4 other albums of thiers, including ILL Communication which I love. But Paul's Boutique is a definate disappointment! I love the Dust Bros. But how pissed I was with almost every song on this album. The Dust's could have done a better job. The Beasties could have too. But (...), every one else I talk to recommends this album. So I made sure I listened to it 3 times. Still, only 2 songs at the most were fair.Peace"
4,Get on the mic,"This album may contain more samples than any other album every released. It contains everything from the likes of the Beatles, Led Zepplin and the Ramones to Johnny Cash, James Brown and Bernard Hermann. Back in the old days of rap, they would just sample anything they felt like, and then they would get sued afterwards. Nowadays, a record company won't release an album until they have permission to use all the samples ahead of time. Anyway, the samples on this album are very skillfully and creatively woven together by the Dust Brothers. The Beastie Boys do their thing, and it all comes together quite nicely. Highly recommended for fans of old school rap."
1,"Great album, poor MP3 version","My rating is *not* of this album, which is great, but of this MP3 version of this album.There are several tracks on this MP3 version where the last half second or so of one track is actually at the start of the next track, which causes a problem if you either don't have the ability to play the tracks gaplesslly, or if you play them on random play or individually. You start a song and you get a brief snippet of the track before, then the song starts. Or without gapless playback, then even when played in order there is a hiccup just before the end of the song where you hear nothing, then the last half second of the song and then the next song starts. I hope they will fix this problem in the encoding. I also hope there is a way for me to redownload the fixed version."
3,A sampler,"This album by the Beastie Boys takes the sampling technique to the extreme. It is a good album, well crafted, worthy of several listenings."
5,This album really shines.,"A cohesive concept album of New York low-lifes (much as Beck's ""Odelay"" was collected stories of Old-West decadence), brilliantly produced and cleverly rapped. The Beasties are at the top of their vocal game, and the Dust Brothers' eclectic, non-sequitor production is a powerful aid to the music (and it does not bog this album down like ""Odelay""). The samples are generally funk and old-school hip-hop, with hyperactive basslines and (GASP) prominent guitars, both of which were hip-hop unknowns at the time. These samples are superb! They add a fluid backdrop to the Beasties' energetic raps. My favorite songs...oh hell, I really like all of the songs on this album because they all cohere so well! BUY THIS DAMN ALBUM!! Rolling Stone put it in their ""200 Best Rock Albums of All Time"" for a REASON!"
1,Princeton Review should be required to reimburse me my LSAT test fee.,"As previous reviewers have mentioned many questions are ambiguous. Some apparently have potential correct solutions that are not considered by the question writers. So, good luck with the ""could be true"" questions.However, if you can quickly and easily match the question you are attempting to answer to the answers provided, put the book down. You are probably prepared for the LSAT because just checking whether your answers are correct is a challenge with this book.In the future, I need to remember to check Amazon reviews before wasting precious time."
2,oh man,sounds like new metallica if your into it thats fine but if you liked old speedealer stuff i don't reccomend this.
1,Poor quality video,"We have used the logic books by the authors and love them. They are well written and interesting. The DVD is a poor quality video recording. The sound quality makes it very difficult to follow. Frequently, the speakers talk about their slides but the slides are cutoff and you can't see them.We thought this would a good, ""fun"" homeschool DVD, but we turned it off after 30 minutes of hoping it would get better. I do not recommend it. However, both books by the same authors are excellent homeschool resources."
1,deceptive packaging,"The cover of this gives the impression that it is useful for teaching logic to elementary and middle school students.Instead of being simple and informative, this is just 2 awkward men standing in front of a blank projection screen and attempting to make jokes about logical reasoning and illogical thought. To their credit, the original presentation must have had cartoon illustrations on the screen, but due to copyright infringement, they could not display them on the DVD.My children would have enjoyed a college level logic class more than this DVD. There are many alternative resources to use to teach children logic -- this DVD only serves to bore them into the belief that logic is only for nerds."
1,"Bad Show, Period.","I love the Dick's Pick series. Finally, someone who loves the Dead to have the freedom to put out the goods. However, that being said this is probably one of the biggest disappointments of the series. Dick Latvala died in 1999, while this was released in 2004, which may have been the problem. The biggest problem with this release is Jerry Garcia sounds like he is having a complete mind cramp. While the rest of the band has their act together, Jerry can't complete a musical thought, until about 2/3 way through the show. Unfortunately, it was a bad night for Jerry. Yes, it happened now and then. What's more unfortunate is nobody put a stop to this release. The real shame is there are better shows from 74', any which would have been better a choice (later releases prove this.) Oh well, scratch your head on this release and move on to something better. Keep on Keepin' on."
3,Way overated,"This game makes you feel like the ultimate spy. You can sneak around and take out enemies in many ways. It is hard to just run around sometimes and the enemies are absolutly stupid. The graphics are good for it's time. The aiming is OK, but could have been better. They expect you to sneak up on enemies all of the time. Very hard. The plot and level design is very simple and the gameplay overall is bad. The game is way overated."
3,Hitman 2,"It is a clever and fun game- but it tries to be too realistic and cant quite keep it up (i mean the AI is smart, but how smart can they really be?) It feels akward sometimes, but is still great fun."
4,Lots of Freedom= Lots of Fun,"Hitman 2 is quite an entertaining game. The levels offer alot of freedom to do things your own way. You can go stealth and use your head or you can go Rambo and use your silenced 9mm, or sniper rifle, or machine gun, or revolver, or sawed-off shotgun, of double Ballers.... you get the point.PROS:-Lots of violence, if you like that sort of thing.-Lots of freedom.-Lots of weapons.-Hardcore theme.-Good graphics.-Good SFX and great music.-Lots of replay value. The ranking system is fun.CONS:-Gameplay is a little clumsy.-The proper way to do certain levels (to get Silent Assasin ranking) is often quite difficult to figure out.-Controls take some practice to get familiar with.This is overall a great game. The stealth aspect takes a little practice but you can always opt to just turn your machine gun on every bad-guy you can find and that's fine too. Awesome replay value and not a bad addition to anyone's collection."
1,ugh,this toothbrush is very awkward to use and not worth the expensesonicare is much better even if you need to use it for 2 minutes instead of 1
2,not enough of a good idea,"I was sad that I had to send this back but its not quite there yet. Not enough power, my teeth didn't feel clean because they were not clean. And the noise.....couldn't keep it. Excellent Idea needs more work."
3,For real beginners,"This book is for real beginners, some interesting capters about techniques and tools but no intresting patterns."
1,RUSH out and buy the originals,"Rush plays RUSH best; go get BLUE CHEER's version of ""Summertime Blues"", or better yet Cream's BBC Live and hear how ""Crossroads"" really was done. (Geddy Lee can't play out of tune like Ginger Baker did)."
5,A must have for the fan of Vintage Rush.,"This album takes me back to the old school Rush of COS & FBN. It's so very refreshing to hear the Boys enjoying the moment and having fun with the material. They really deserve it. Congrats on 30 years in the biz, see ya in Tampa, Guys.Kisses =o)"
1,Bad news - safe to skip this,Get one of their earlier CDs - Moving Pictures or earlier or a decent greatest hits CD and forget this. The songs just don't sound good with Geddy Lee's voice. All covers of older classic rock songs (the liner notes say something about songs they played when they were a garage band - should have stayed in the garage.
4,For fans,"With great personality, Rush feeds us back by saying 'Hey, we wanna have fun...if you also like it, that's great.'First Rush CD purchase? Skip it to another one."
3,A good album - but Rush as a cover band?,"This is a good album, no doubt. And this is a decent Rush album. Yet, it seems oddly out of place. If one listens to this CD alongside the self-titled first album, then it works. If one listens to it next to the classic Rush lineup of 2112, Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures, then it sticks out. Moreover, the band never really lets loose here; while the music has feeling, these three talented musicians don't really take any chances.Bottom line: this is Rush trying to find new direction. They are returning to their roots for a reason and perhaps we should watch as they find their way. Hopefully, this album is an indication that the old Rush is about to re-emerge. As it stands, it is worth listening to, but not anywhere near potential."
1,Traing for 2004!,"Nice photos and description of the product, they just never show you the back of the shirt which gives the date of the 2004 Chicago marathon, 10/10/2004. So if you already ran the 2004 marathon and want to be nostalgic, great, otherwise don't bother buying this shirt. I bought it as a present for people currently training for the Chicago marthon this year, 10/9/2005, and they were too nice to say anything until I was running with them and noticed the date! False advertising! I used to like Road Runner but they have sunk to the bottom of the barrel trying to peddle old merchandise."
4,Dad comes home,"A withdrawn and hardened father comes home from prison to live with his mother and a daughter he has never met. He must deal with his past and confront the present, his daughter wants to get to know him and a jail doctor wants his hidden robbery money. What ensues is a story of answering questions about the past, opening up to love, and and dealing with murder. TLJ fans will recognize the actors character moodiness, conflict with self, and surprise irony and wit in one of his early works."
1,This book [is bad],"This book needs some serious editingRight now I'm on Chapter 4 and so far this book is terrible in regards to the Projects. The project instructions don't correspond with the results intended and shown. For example, the instructions say open the Customer by Country report, but then it says 'your report should look like this' and shows you an entirely different report! And sometimes the report you worked on doesn't even work for the task you're trying to learn. The author must have had his friends write the other customer reviews. Don't buy this book! It's just unfortunate though that there aren't many choices."
3,Not bad,"I would give this movie a B- as it was intersting with decent acting. didn't blow my socks off, but worth the expense."
1,Yikes! Read before you buy,"I picked up a copy of Eloise expecting to like it. I was floored the first time I read it, which made it the last time I read it. I'm not certain what the appeal of this story is, and I love stories of spunky little girls like Ramona Quimby and Matilda. This is not one of those stories. Eloise is a spoiled and bratty little girl who treats everyone around her badly. And that is all. The story goes on and on with all the bratty things she does. That's the entire story! Not really the lesson I want my own little ones to pick up."
5,It's an Original!,"Such a wonderful original there were bound to be spinoffs. Looking forward to introducing my midwestern granddaughter to Eloise at the Plaza on her next visit to NYC, now that they've met through the books - original and ready to-read. Eloise is still a delight!"
5,Farewell to a beloved author,"During my first visit to the Plaza Hotel I noticed the painting near the lobby, when I asked who is was of, the shocked answer was ""Eloise, of course! Haven't you ever read that book?"" Of course I ran right out and purchased a copy. I loved it and raced home from New York to share it with my children, who were familiar with the Plaza through the movie Home Alone 2. It is now one of their favorite books. They want to be Eloise and live in a hotel and run all over it. I don't blame them, everytime I visit the Plaza I think of that little girl and wish I could follow her on her travels and adventures. Someone at the Plaza told me that Eloise was based on Liza Minelli when she was young and her mother Judy Garland lived at the Plaza. I don't know if that is true or not, but it's fun to think so! Thank you Kay Thompson for bringing out the imp in me evertime I think of Eloise!"
1,Junk,Great for being small and sneaking in places your not supposed to fish... I was fishing at a golf course and I had a 1 lb Largemouth bass on and while fighting the fish the rod broke!! So I bought another one and the rod broke again on a 3 lb bass. Good rod for kids catching 2-10 inch fish. But broke on me twice while fighting a fish.
5,Great Collection,"I just got this box set when the price is 30% off. That mean the price is equal when you purchase each album individually. But you will get a nice black roll-top wooden box and sixty pages booklet contain information of every songs.The package is very well designed, each cd will fit in its own slot, so you can take cd out very easily and safe for transporation. I quite surprised when I first received this box set and found that none of cd case was broken when consider that this shipped from US to Thailand.This collection is good for every Beatles fan. you get all official UK album plus Past Master I&II.; If you order this with Anthology, this will be a greate collection."
3,Why not the original American releases!,"I give this three stars because it's the Beatles. I take away two stars because it's too pricey and doesn't include the American releases.I hear all this ballyhoop about the original british mono recordings (purists) and nice black box and booklet. Well, I grew up listening to the Beatles in America. Is it too much to ask to have the American releases (in a box set or not!). And all of them. Why did the labels have to take the Hey Jude album and sling parts of it to other discs. For the record, (pun intended) Not all of the Hey Jude songs were put on other discs. The version of ""I should've know better"" from Hey Jude was in stereo. The ""A Hard Day's Night"" version is mono. You can't buy the stereo version on any disc. And I don't care about ""let it be naked"" and alternate takes. Let it be what I was used to. Only a nice clear digital transfer to CD.Anybody else feel my pain?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"PROBLEMS:(1) Controller does not work from more than 6' away.(2) Battery connector pops loose with even a low speed bump.(3) Will not work on even new, clean carpet, grass, sand, snow seem highly unlikely.(4) You will never use this on water unless you want to watch it drift away once it is more than a few feet out, then SINK when it runs out of battery power (says in the owner's manual that it does not float).SUMMARY: This product is a total waste of money."
5,Four old classics.,"A nice tape featuring four (4) old classic cartoons: Christmas Circus, The Shanty Where Sanyt Claus Lives, Snow Man, and the Warner Bros. sports parody Sports Chumpions. Great for Christmas, or all year for anyone interested in classic animation or vintage cartoons."
1,not good,"pretty crappy,you need to write down your answers,some questions are worded wrong,once you play a category once it is pointless to play it again,there is no randomness,same order same questions,very disappointed..."
2,not all that...,"We love demerara sugar in tea, however, this left us terribly disappointed! The sugar arrived hard - had to run it through the blender just to loosen it enough to be useable (but then it's powdery and not good for baking with).I'll never order this again - we went back to our favorite brand (Tate & Lyle) just wish that amazon carried it..."
3,disappointed and an unpleasant smell,well....let me state first that we like this natural sugar. that said...when we received it...it must have come in contact with dampness either from the manufacturer or via shipping....each bag of sugar was hard. we had to bang it on the counter many times to break it up. have had it once before and it was fine. wasn't hard or lumpy but still smelled weird!now for the unpleasant part....it does not smell like regular processed white sugar from supermarkets. it has an odor of cat pee. which i thought very peculiar. although...when you use it to cook with or put it in tea..coffee...cereal...this odor disappears completely. i guess it's the nature of the unrefined processing????it's actually stronger than 'white' sugar! you don't need as much! and we will buy it again. just don't have a sensitive nose or keep your nose out of the sugar jar! and you'll be just fine!
3,eh??,"Not what I was expecting. Too steep of a slope and the padding is insufficicent to protect my legs. Not really friendly for a tall person 6'1"" or above."
5,"Easy to assemble, reasonable price, decent quality",The board was easy to assemble. I had the kids helping me. My four year old loved the project. And it's a good board for a reasonable price.
2,back decompression,I purchased this slant board to use only for back decompression but the top foam pads are too close to the board to hook the ankles and keep you on the board.
2,Apex JD-1.2 Slant Board,Could be adjustable higher but the main problem is that the knee supports are way too narrow - two inches on either side would have made to product pennies more expensive but much much more comfortable.
2,"Not What You Think, Read this Review","This slant board is just ok. It arrived on time from Amazon and was, as reported, easy to assemble. But as reported, it DOES NOT adjust the angle and the photo Amazon is using in not the slant board you will get. The incline angle is simply not adjustable, only the leg holder is. As reported, the pads on the ankle and knee supports are way too thin and painful unless you add your own padding. This slant board is built well, but not designed well. If the company weren't so cheap they'd use a better grade of foam support and more of it. As for the adjustable angle, it just doesn't have that feature and Amazon should say so instead of using a photo that completely misinforms consumers."
1,Different flags,"The product pictured is not what the product actually is. It actually has 2 small flag style decals as pictured in addition to two very small decals in the shape of the US in red/white/blue. The other two decals are small flags made to appear as waving flags but are, in my opinion, not very attractive. Much smaller than I expected."
5,Great album,"An amazing album, one of the most influential in thrash metal. All of this greatness was done before Mustaine turned into a d-bag.Even though I'm too young to have a comparison of the original soundings of the first prints, this reissue sounds really nice on my turntable and sony speakers.Definitely worth the $$ spent.Thanks!"
4,Unique Sound,"I don't have the remastered version, so I can't speak for it, but I own the original version which is very good. I really like the sound on this disc, it's got a different feel for me than other Megadeth albums. It's heavy, but not as heavy as their three previous albums, but it's faster and more complex, imo. All of the songs on it are good, but my favorites are Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Rust in Peace and my very favorite, Five Magics. As I've said, while this is their fourth album is sounds different from the first three and all others that follow it. I really like this disc and sometimes throw it in when I'm in the mood for some Megadeth but with a bit of a different sound."
5,Best metal album of all time!,"I have been a heavy metal fan since the mid 80's. I kinda liked Megadeth's ""So far, so good...so what"", but wasn't totally impressed by it. I frankly couldn't tell what the big deal with Megadeth was. But when I heard Rust In Peace, it was a game changer for me. I really liked the raw sound, excellent riffs and Marty's melodic solos. To this day, I have not heard another album from any other metal band that can match Rust In Peace. When Megadeth came out with Countdown To Extinction, once again, I was disappointed. Not that it sucked, it actually has some really good songs on it. But it wasn't Rust In Peace. Megadeth's Rust In Peace is a standard by which every other album is judged."
3,Overrated,"Sorry droogies, but this ain't the masterpiece you think it to be. This album has loaded with jaw-dropping instrumental work and is lacking only a couple things, but they are huge ones: GOOD VOCaLS and AMBIENCE. If you look at the works of bands like Metallica and Rush in their prime, those songs literally envelop you. 'Rust in Peace' doesn't have that quality, although 'Peace Sells...' comes somewhat closer. That said, this is Megadeth's last decent album."
1,Buy Peace Sells,"I expected a whole lot more from this line-up. I cannot like any of the songs on this CD. Peace Sells is by far their best album darker, heavier with better production, songs, riffs and solos."
1,YOU DO NOT WANT THIS VERSION!!! NOOOO!!!,"This, probably the best metal album in the world, has been remastered and the vocals have been resung in parts. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! IT IS TERRIBLE! MAKE SURE YOU FIND AND GET THE ORIGINAL, WHETHER ON EBAY OR SOMEWHERE!!!! AVOID THIS VERSION LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!"
3,An average Megadeth offering,"Although I can't say anything bad about this album, I can't really think of anything great to say either. I bought this CD to complete my Megadeth collection, listened to it twice, and put back in the case, and back on the shelf. Yes, there are some high notes, but the rest is just average.If you're new to Megadeth and want some of their early work, ""Peace Sells..."" is a better start.Old time fans will probably consider this album an underrated treasure, but I just didn't think much of it."
5,A classic,"Megadeth created a classic when they released ""Rust in Peace"", and even 11 years later, it still sounds great. As a guitarist I tried playing some of the songs, and they are by far the hardest songs to play and Dave and crew make it sound easy. Megadeth took thrash to a new level with ""Rust in Peace"", but they surpassed it with their next album, ""Countdown to Extinction""."
5,Go Mega,"This album rocks. Megadeth started slow with Killing is my Business then they picked up with Peace Sells. Afterwards, they went down when they did So Far...So Good...So what because of drup problems and the expulsion of Poland and Samuelson. In R.I.P, come in Menza and Friedman and they do a great job of defining their ranks. This album is probably one of their best. I don't know why it only has a 4 out of 5. I believe it should have a 4.5 or 5. In my opinion, it was great. I hope you like it and enjoy it."
3,A Worthy Piece of Metal,"Rust in Peace is a pretty good album. Great production and very tight playing. A metal album with a good production isn't something that can always be found. Haven't got all of Megadeth's stuff, but of what I have, this is their apex and best moment. If you want to hear great metal from a couple other groups, give CELTIC FROST or the group CORONER a listen (they're the best in my opinion)."
4,"Informative, well written, good photos","This book was everything I expected. It's very good as a preview for visiting the island. The history gets a little dry after awhile; otherwise, a pretty good book."
2,YOU DON'T FEEL THIS ONE,"This is the release after ""For My Broken Heart"". The problem with this one is that it suffers to much by comparison to the former release (HEART) which was far superior...probably the best of Reba's nineties projects. This one is not a very good follow up. The songs are dull and blase'. Enough said."
1,NOT A GOOD SONG IN THE BUNCH!!,I'm sorry to say that this CD is not up to Reba's 80s material. There is not one good song in the bunch here. A totally wasted effort!!
2,You've gotta be a Jayhawks fan; otherwise it all sounds the same.,"The songs are pleasant enough; the lyrics are clever enough; the musicianship is adequate. But the variety of melodies is just not there. I never knew of this band until Amazon recommended it, and I bought it; I wish I hadn't."
2,Only for film buffs,"The only interest of ""The delinquents"" is in film history. This the first movie ever directed by the great Robert Altman (Mash, The player, Short cuts) in 1957.It's a low budget ""Z movie"" with little directorial value. Recommended only for movie fans and collectors."
2,Beware! Not like the others!,"This is not like the other Spy Fox games.....it is only an arcade style game. My 6 year old likes it, but gets bored quickly. If you are expecting a great, complex, problem solving type game like the other Spy Fox games, don't buy this one."
4,Note on the mixing,"Since I concur with the positive comments on the performance posted by other LC fans, I won't bore you with repeating mine here. but I must add a negative comment here on the mixing and/or mastering of this CD: it is ill-suited to LC's extraordinary artistry. LC's beautiful voice is made distant, edgy and the volume is too low relative to the instrumentation. The dynamic range is compressed; the instrumnts are one big muddle, with too much upper midrange and little bass. This especially strange here, as her previous album (WTRosesBA) was mastered in pristine HDCD sound.Too bad about this one, as the perormances are very fine.Still, I am a huge admirer of LC's work, and hope that no one will be deterred by these comments from buying this, despite the mediocre sound. I hope that the next one will be mixed and mastered at the high level of Ms. Cantrell's artistry."
3,Sweatshirt review,"Product very good for the price. The shirt was not what I had expected, I probably should have purchased heavier fabric."
4,A COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nice cd better than his last few, He toured with is lp got to see him 2 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best album that I ever heard,"This is an amazing album from various points of view:First: the songs. The album contains a great range of music like ballads (Distractions), pop (My brave face), rock (Figure of eight), experimental (Ou est le soleil), acoustic (Put it there), reggae (How many people), gospel (That day is done), jazz (loveliest thing).Second: the production and playing. The sound in Flowers in the dirt is perfect, every detail is just a gift to the ear.Third: the lyrics. Elvis Costello helps Macca to make songs with intelligence"
3,Paul McCartney - Flowers In The Dirt,"This CD is not bad, but it's not the best of Paul. There are songs with electronic sound and comes to tire a bit. The best songs are in sequence and are fifth in the octave bands (We Got Married, Put It There, Figure Of Eight and This One), and may even include My Brave Face. The other songs are at best tolerated. More or less!"
5,Great Solo McCartney album,"I just love this album, a great mix of old and new styles from Paul McCartney. If there is any post-Beatles McCartney albums you need to have then this is the one, even overBand on the Run(the classic Wings album, but over rated in my opinion). In many ways you can almost hear perhaps what the Beatles could have sounded if they had lasted together until 1990. Elvis Costello's influence is huge however, and the partnership honed the best out of Paul, just as Lennon and Harrison did in the 60s. Great clean production and great sounding tracks - top marks for this one Paul!"
5,"Still Beatlesque, but full Sir Paul also... Great album!","This is one of my ""MUST HAVE 100 albums"". A good friend of mine sent me the LP version from Spain a long time ago, as soon as it was put for sale at the record shop shelves in Madrid. Even when Paul McCartney cannot deny being still under the shadows of Beatles' influence, this album has terrific music, and really beautiful songs like ""This One"" and ""Put It There"" (a small musical jewel!). ""Figures Of Eight"", ""My Brave Face"", ""Rough Ride"" and even ""We Got Married"" bring the part of excellent PMcC Rock. Definitely one of McCartney's best!"
3,Fun But Not Very Challenging,"The obvious choice for a comparison of this game is Gran Turismo 3. GT3, however, is in a class by itself. Sega GT 2002 stands well by itself. The graphics are sharp and good looking if not a little blocky. The lighting and weather are well done but with little variation. It's mostly daytime or early evening. The Rally course is a good looking night course with snow.The physics are good and controlling the cars is easy enough.The cars are plentiful and once you start winning races you can build up money fast. I found the starting cash low and your first car is going to be less then impressive. I started off with a Corolla. If you don't get a license right away you can win several races without modifying the car, which allows you to save money fast. I haven't played a lot yet but there seem to be a wide range of autos to choose from.If I have one complaint it would be that so far the game is almost too easy. Over all it's a well rounded game."
2,This game is a HUGE dissapointment!,"I was looking forward to this game so bad that it was all I could think about for days before it came out. Well, I was greatly dissapointed! The graphics are BLAH at best. The game play is choppy and bumpy. The XBox processor can do much better than this. When are game designers going to utalize the XBox's true potential? This game looks like junk and is NOT fun...this makes me sad. I really wanted to like it. RENT IT FIRST!"
5,Highly Motivating and Entertaining,"With her breezy, girlfriend-next-door tone, Nicole Williams, author of ""Wildly Sophisticated,"" takes readers on a journey of financial self exploration. With anecdotes from female entrepreneurs like herself, she encourages women to both explore and challenge their preconceived about success and money - particularly those which come from childhood. Williams also discusses our various ""money relationships,"" from bankers and accountants to employers and even friends and family, as well as how we should approach them all.Unlike other authors who challenge readers to save more and spend less, Williams encourages her audience to actually earn more. She does this by focusing on the concept of self worth (both tangible and intangible), our true values, and how that all translates into business success - or lack thereof. Highly motivating and entertaining."
4,"Great quality product, well-made","We purchased this gate to use in a doorway to keep three little ones from escaping their playroom. It arrived the day after I placed my order. The product packaging was great, however the installation instructions were hard to follow. It goes require use of the wall mounting cups. It took more than two hours for me to install which was much longer than I planned when embarking on installation. I did call North States and got the installation help I needed easily. The gate is extremely well made and heavy duty. It does require you to push the thumb tab AND lift up to open the gate which I didn't realize before I received it. Because it is SO heavy, I have had some wrist pain from opening it repeatedly. However, I am pleased with the sturdiness of the gate and will likely buy another one for my stairway."
4,diamond d productions,"diamond d doesn't rap on this one, but that's allright, master robb is the mc here and is great behind diamond d's production.very good album from late 80's: especially supreme diamond d,a song that has diamond d goin through the alphabet using just samples of course. official release has 2 cd's.original album and instrumentals for every track"
1,"Not good, doesn't hold up.","I bought this when it came out, it sounded good at the time, but boy has TIME hurt this album. I can hardly listen to any of it anymore. Great band, but this is where they bottomed out. Get their music from 1976-1985."
2,an irregular heart beat,"This album promised to be a return to the band's roots when they achieved the perfect balance between acoustic and electric rock. ""Brigage"" unfortunately only gave us a small dosage of that history. The album has some great songs like ""Wild Child"", ""the Night"" and ""Call of the Wild."" Alas, top-40 oriented ballads like ""Secret"" and ""I Didn't Want to Need You"" dominate the show. For every killer tune, theres a downer resulting in a very inconsistent album."
3,Not Their Best,"I was hoping this would trend along with Bad Animals but it took a dive down from previous ones. I rank it at the bottom 3 of all Heart albums. I own them all and for me this is their 3rd least liked album for me, the bottom ones are well...(Private Audition, Passionworks). The album has good songs like: ""Under The Sky, Stranded, Wild Child, I Want Your World To Turn"" but other tracks were kinda off and a bit bland. Too radio friendly some tracks were and it kinda washed away the glitter of past albums."
4,"I don't write checks, I write rhymes.","I don't know what some of the negative reviewers have been smoking, but this album is strictly heat. Tracks like 'Another Sound Mission' and single 'Back Again' pretty much sum up the sound of this record. The production is slightly updated, taking on more of a future boom-bap style sound. Very solid effort - definitely as good or better than 'Neighborhood Watch'."
4,Action Packed!,This game is filled with stealth operations and alot detailed enviroments.It has alot of sneakeness and alot of gun shootouts!I recommend this game for people who like movies with hitmen in them.This game is great.
3,"Good stuff, little pricey","This stuff does the trick for filtering and keeping tanks looking good. However, If you don't have ammonia issues in general, it's a little pricey. We have Koi, and they're notoriously dirty fish, but with routine maintenance we don't have ammonia spikes or nitogen issues. A standard activated carbon works for us, and we order that from a chem company. However, if your tank needs some dire or extra attention, this is the way to go. Does several jobs at once, and works quickly provided you have a decent filtration system."
3,Not much change in quality downloading,Download quality somewhat better. Film of much better quality that any of the Iron Boys series. At one point in the film. . .the download froze and remained that way for over a minute before it began playing again. Still greatly disappointed by the downloading.
4,Too Few Harvey to Enjoy,"I enjoyed the Steve Harvey show, It was witty and fun. When I bought Volume one of the best of the show, I felt cheated. I would have enjoyed a full box set of season one and all I got were five episodes....and none were the pilot of this show. Th shows were Harvey, just not at his best. However five episodes of Steve is better than nothingBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
1,STILL NO SERIES DVD? WHY???,"Can someone point me where to lodge a complaint about this woefully-incomplete DVD? This show was literally the flagship for the WB network during its entire run.Can you tell me why in the hell less-popular, lower-rated WB shows like ""Wayans Brothers"", ""Jamie Foxx"", and ""Sister Sister"" get full treatment?With the seemingly endless stream of obscure 50s and 60s TV shows getting DVD treatment, how a show like this cannot get a full series DVD is simply baffling. Sony's gonna force me to DVR the series off of syndication and do what should be done myself!"
5,Where's the rest?,"I'm with the majority of the other people who commented on this DVD. How come there isn't a box set of this innovative, witty, hilarious show yet?"
5,Dean dream,"This is my second copy of this cd....the first one went missing. With the exception of the first track ""That certain Party"" with the stupid Jerry Lewis/Dean Martin tune that's rather annoying to me - the rest of this cd is great. I especially love ""Money, burns a hole in my pocket"" and ""Sway"", but heck this is my favorite feel good Dean Martin cd, which says a lot cuz I probably have at least 10 different Dean cd's including his essential hits. This one's really great for the car. I love it! The audio is also very nice quality on this cd. Sounds sweet on my bose :)"
2,Fishy,"The product works like it should and did an excellent job styling a mohawk, however the scent is horrendous. It was described as ""rubbing 5 day old fish bait all over your face."" Ewww. I would have returned it, but it was going to cost $5 to ship it back. Now I'm stuck with stinky hair goo that I will never use again."
2,"Bad scope, even for beginners.","I bought this scope this year.. so far.. the only thing I can see is the moon with the x45 eyepiece, well.. I might say its a good scope for lunar observations. When I saw it.. I was happy.. hoping to see planets. I say Venus, used my barlow lens with the x 225 eyepeice.. couldn't see ANYTHING at all. Bad quality, it broke.. the mirror for the triangular thing came off.. and the silver metal thing.. got stuck inside. Just DON'T GET IT, BEWARE!"
1,Disappointing!!!,Wow! I use Pacific Foods beef and chicken stock all the time & I guess I expected more! Convenience isn't worth it if the soup is super salty and tastes processed!!!! Hardly any barley or beef! I cooked up one bag & I'm throwing the rest out!
1,Cannot accept reality,"HAHA Just when I thought Democrats and Republican critics can't get any more desperate, they come up with this immature piece of garbage. Their like a spoiled child who just lost a playground game, sore and I mean sore, losers."
2,"Not Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee or Shahid Parvez","True Vilayat Khan was a great musician. but he certainly lacked the raagdari and laya Kari of Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee. Shahid Pervez observed this lack in the Etawah gharana and ameliorated his playing to a level never played by anyone in his lineage. Any one who truly knows Indian music will tell you Shahid Pervez has by far surpassed Vilayat. I understand Vilayat Khans fans have to keep the old glory alive, but lets call a spade a spade.Kishan maharaj recently played with Shahid Parvez and after the concert he also explicitly said that Shahid has topped the etawah clan."
1,It never once worked,I bought this DVD on Amazon.com and this DVD never once worked on any of my DVD players. A total waist of my money.
2,Tears of one of the movie goers,It's boring and extremely illogical. The truth is nobody in that situation could have helped rescued so many people if he did not have the support of many air planes and infantries. I found the fighting scenes were not engaging either.I did not have to pay the full price for the ticket but I still think it's a waste of money
4,bruce willis,"the movie was a good movie, good story, the sad part in this movie was the killing of all of thosepoor people, all they wanted was freedon for there people,bruce and his buddys gave a good performacethe action was great, i did not want to leave my seat. the costar was good in her playing the doctorwho was to have been saved.i give this dvd, four stars."
1,"The Dumb & The Dumber, When Navy Seals meet the Rebels","Let's make it really simple, the movie shall instead named ""The Dumb and The Dumber,When Navy Seals meet the Rebels"", the title said it all !!"
1,a complete waste of time,"I watched this last night with my brother, and literally after 10 minutes we were bored to death. Completely unbelievable. A Navy SEAL disobeying direct orders, the big-baby doctor, the ""I'm sorry about your men"" cheesy, lame dialogue, oh, it was painful. I like a good war flick...and I like thoughtful movies...but this movie was like the chameleon it showed in one of the segue shots: it just kept changing. Was it a war movie? Was it trying to make a political statement? Was it trying to feed off of America's corporate guilt for not doing anything about the numerous incidents of genocide in Africa? Was it a romance movie? It felt forced, contrived, and unrealistic. I'm sorry that watched it."
4,Painful,I appreciate the complicated views of people and governments. I was stunned at the exposure of ethnic cleansing in this film. It falls into the list of movies that in my opinion- everyone needs to watch ONCE. I wouldn't want to have to watch it again.
5,Outstanding Film,This was an outstanding film that showed a tremendous performance by Bruce Willis and company. Tremendous amount of action and some mystery as to who the traitor was. Monica Belluci is gorgeous no matter what she wears and the story will make you cry in it's intesity. Truly a 5* movie !
3,Tears of the Sun,In my opinion this movie is a plot taken from Air America where Mel Gibson reluctantly has to rescue a bunch of refugees.In Tears of the Sun the same plot is used.
1,Take the Ham Cure,The only good parts of this movie were the inexplicable and annoyingly intentional shots of Monica Bellucci's cleavage.Acting was way overdone. This movie was boring boring boring. I think the other reviewer was right to say that Bruce Willis acted the movie as if he'd signed the contract without reading the script.Even if you like Bruce W. I would skip this movie.
1,Don't be fooled by the commercials!!,"When I first saw the movie trailer, I quickly went ans watched it in theaters. But I came out very disappointed. The action you see in the commercials is ALL the action. Period. This is more of a National Geographic documentary than an action movie... it doesn't even deserve to be called ""action."" I would give this zero stars if I could!!"
1,terrible...terrible,"I just recently saw this movie and I thought it was incredibly boring. There was absolutely nothing to this movie that I even remotely liked. There was way too much filler, The dialouge was stupid and the moral of the story resembled that of a pokemon movie. I want my money back!"
2,"What Can I Say, it's Bruce Willis...","...if you expect one of his movies to become a classic or even critically acclaimed, you're deluding yourself. The guy is Sylvester Stallone without the dopey looks and speech impediment. If all you want is another brainless, poorly scipted action flick, this is as good as any. Ra Ra, Go USA.Die Hard indeed. He needs to take early retirement (although Unbreakable was decent... the only decent one in recent memory, actually). : )"
4,cute movie,a good nature film and beautiful country. It was a good nature if your into this kind of movies the life of a polar bear
5,Best book I have ever read.,"This is the best book I have ever read!!!! I have read many books but none by Hemenway. I would not recommend this book to those who don't read much, as this is a long book that must be read as much at once as possible for the full effect of the novel comes into play as the climax turns out to be what you might expect would have happened in the first 100 pages. This book is much more about characters and life in the peril of the wilderness during a vast war. This book is about killing and death. This book is about love and war. This book is about humanity. This book is about chaos. This book is about living as a wanderer not knowing if you are lost. This book is about accomplishing the mission with what you have. This book is......excellent.Not for your average taste, but for the taste of those who love true character. A very sad ending makes the book very believable."
3,I like The Beautiful People better!,I think that Manson is a good but not great musician as so many people think. He needs to get out of the gothic music. I like The Beautiful People better. I just can't get enough of that great guitar work in that song.
4,"Stevie ""Guitar"" Miller","This is back when Steve Miller was known and stevie guitar. A lot of people who only know him from the joker and albums after may not realize that he had a double lp 'best of' before those other albums were released. Radio changed from album cuts to safe top 40 and Stevie guitar became stevie pop star. Oh well, a man has to eat. If you look at his early albums tho, you may notice BOZ SCAGGS was in the band."
3,A Remix? or what?,I loved Steve Miller's early work back in the days in San Francisco. I saw the group several times at the Fillmore and Avalon ballrooms. I had the original vinyl LP. It sounded great. This CD seems dead with no ambience that was in the original. Did they remix it or am I just dreaming?
5,Tamora Pierce Is One of the Best Fantasy Writers!,"This book was amazing! I have never read Tamora Pierce before, but you can bet I am now! Veralidaine(a.k.a. Daine) is a very interesting character, who lives in a world where magical abilities are common and an ancient barrier between mortals and immortals is about to break. Daine has magical powers, but they are a little out of the ordinary, because she has so little control over them. She is occasionaly visited by a badger in her dreams, who gives her advice. There are hints about something dark from her past that has her worried, but I'm not telling what it is. To find out(and start your Pierce collection), buy this book. It's a definite must read!"
1,Hated it,"I brought this book having been led to believe that it was suitable for an older audience. It didn't take long for me to realize that it's not. This book is clearly meant for young adults.Even so, I didn't think this was a good book. I've read books for young adults (I am 32) and enjoyed them very much. This was not enjoyable at all. The prose was weak, the characters boring, everyone was either too happy and nice, or too evil and mean. It was very slow and not very descriptive. I didn't care about anyone, or what happened to them. Many of the characters were unbelievable. Sometimes, I even found it hard to believe that the animals were real! I can't think of a single other book I've read when that has happened - when the animals in a book don't even seem like animals!Terrible."
2,Okay...,"The book was interesting, but not interesting enough. It is machine fantasy, whipped out for hundreds of people who are fantasy nuts. There wasn't anything really good about them, but they were fun for times when you have nothing else to read. Not really worth while."
3,Rent don't buy,"All-in-all it's a good movie. If you're a diehard fan-boy you'll probably find all kinds of problems and issues with it. If you're a casual comic book cartoon movie aficionado then you'll really enjoy it. However, there is one major issue with this movie, and that's the animation style. The backgrounds are great and drawn wonderfully. However, the actual people animation is horrible. The people are drawn with minimal attention to detail, and it sucks. They hit a home run back in the 90's with the Batman and Superman cartoons. Instead of growing on that style of animation, they keep trying to reinvent animation styles, and just keep failing. On the plus they have the original Superman and Batman voice actors."
2,Justice League Doom,This movie is okay. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. The action scenes were much better and the plot kept me on the edge of the seat. The only thing in this movie that was good was the Batman's plan to neutralize the Justice League members.
3,Good but not Great,"Animation is a bit strange and simple. Story is a bit rushed. Overall not too bad, just good in a nostalgic sort of way. I would rather have seen this in a more detailed 2hr. movie or even better a 2 part series."
4,"Not the best one in Bruce Timm's JL Series, but still very entertaining","Ok, I am a huge fan of the new JL series (I have all of the seasons on DVD- and all of the movies). This one isn't super high-concept; the fight scenes end a little illogically or the victories come too easy; and one could even call this film redundant but it is still entertaining and is still pretty darn good.The tribute to Dwayne McDuffie in the features is absolutely beautiful and sincere. This makes it all worth it."
3,Just ok,There was nothing in it we haven't seen before. Animation characters were oddly lanky and shapeless. This defiantly wasn't on the level of Apocalypse or Crisis. I still gave it a 3 cause I love DC and there isn't anything wrong with it just no wow factor like some of the other movies. And I am beyond tired of worshiping at the Batman alter. He's featured in almost every movie.
4,Flawed Plot,"Spoilers Alert!First off I enjoyed most of the movie, but there were some problems with the premise. Vandal Savage purposed to destroy half the earth and all electronics would be useless. Metallo should of had a problem with his plan because he would be destroyed. Superman was shot with a kryptonite bullet, but once it was removed had no signs of kryptonite blood poisoning. Also the flash had a bomb implanted through his wrist that would explode if he decelerated (why takeoff running at top speed?)or vibrated, but he vibrated his electrons to pass through an iceberg to freeze the bomb. It was a flawed movie,but still very enjoyable; 4 stars."
3,Decent DC animated film,"This was an enjoyable outing. It is not on the same level as ""Batman, Under the Red Hood"" or ""All Star Superman"" which I consider to be among the best in the DC animated universe. But it is the best of the Justice League Movies that have come out so far.Disclaimer: I'll watch anything with superheroes."
4,Two Great DC Characters Working 2Gether,"The artwork took me a little to get comfortable with, however it was a refreshing twist to the mundane everyday one.Like the NEW League of Doom concept and how they touched upon a few different concepts.Every time I see it, I capture something new, definitely one that I would recommend."
3,Another sleeper film that merits some attention,"Seeing a fantastic price on this film, I just had to buy regardless of what it was. I had no expectations, as I knew nothing of the theme, characters, actors, etc. It turns out it is a fairly good film about college, the ""girl of our dreams"", and dealing with not finding, or marrying, Mr.(or Ms.) Right. Monet Mazur is so gorgeous that my thesaurus fails me...she is supposed to be the form(perfection) of the unobtainable college girl, and she achieves that. The male lead pines for her the whole film, continually trying to be with her, see her, help her. In the old days, this was regarded as love. His efforts get him close to the unobtainable, but in the end...I won't ruin it for you. Overall, if you had no expectations of the film, it is quite adequate and succeeds in its small aspiration as being a ""coming of age""film, albeit in college."
1,DOA.,"I got this in the mail and it wasn't DVI-I like shown in the picture. There were many pins missing, therefore rendering it useless."
2,Sit-up Board,I was a little disappointed in that the distance for from your knees to your feet is shorter than I would like and I am only 5 ft. 9in.
3,Didn't really help...,"I bought this in the hopes it would help keep our 40 gallon tank clearer than it has been as of late. But, to no avail. I have 4 large angelfish and a few bottom feeders but nothing seems to help this tank. I'm about ready to give up on the tank to be honest. However, I do have another snail infestation so I'm sure that is contributing to the problem as well. However, this does keep it a clear lime green so that is definitely an improvement over the slime. I'm getting ready to take it down again in the hopes that this will help. I do recommend this, but just be aware that it won't solve all your problems."
4,kitchen cart,This is a beautiful addition to the kitchen; it is as beautiful in reality as it is in the picture.I was able to assemble it by myself but needed some help to stand it up on its rollers. The marble top makesthe unit heavy but gives it a sturdy feeling.My surprises were that the unit is taller than my other carts and it doesn't move around as easily as my othercarts. We're going to work on the wheels with some WD40 to see if we can make it more mobile.I like the towel rack at the end of the unit but think I will remove the wine rack.All in all this proved to be pretty much what I expected.
3,A Telescope is less than what you expect,"I bought this Telescope for my son, expecting to be able to see the stars...These are a couple of problems related to telescopes in general, this one in particular is not an exception:* Telescopes are difficult to use, locating stars/planets is quite difficult, and requires a lot of patience (not all kids come with this!)* When you get to, say, the Moon, what you see is a bit disappointing... It is only a bit bigger, you see more detail, but nothing else."
4,Almost like being there,"I bought this telescope for my husband for Father's Day, but ended up giving it to him early. He was always out on the back porch looking at the night sky. After receiving this telescope, I'm not sure he even comes in at night anymore. He loves it.Celestron 21041 60mm PowerSeeker Telescope"
5,love it,great starter telescope! super clear. great product. We bought this for our teenage daughter and we have found her gazing on a regular basis.
5,Daily Walk Bible,My son purchased this for me last Christmas. I enjoyed it so much I decided to purchase one myself for a gift. I read it everyday and have been blessed because of it.
5,The Mark of Distinction The Brand of Cain,"Simply, a great aggressive rock album from an Aussie band. Heavy riffs and hard hitting drumming. Easily one of my favourite albums of all time. If you like anything with some power, go The Mark Of Cain. Produced by Henry Rollins. They never made it big commercially (Triple J regulars however), but have a huge legion of fans around the country! When you see them live, you are left asking (screaming) for more. Sensational album!!!"
5,A Must Have CD,"With music like this its no wonder that The Mark Of Cain won Rolling Stones ""Heavy Band Of The Year"" a few years back.... With catchy, hard hitting riffs and a drum track that brings it all together this album is a must buy for any fan of Helmet, Rollins or anything in this Heavy Alternative Genre."
3,This trailer is ---- OK,"I did not have trouble putting the trailer together as others have said, but I have had some problems. First, it will not attach to some bikes, such as my wife's new Giant, and that is a real inconvenience b/c now we have to get a either a bike seat for our son or a new trailer - guess which one is cheaper. Also, the velcro that holds the door down is already wearing out after one season. It does the job, but I think it really comes down to getting what you pay for."
1,poor clasp,"I purchased this one year ago at costco, the price was good compared to retail bike stores. I did read the review that the clasp kept falling off the bike but ther other reviwes did not notice the problem.I ride a Trek mtn bike with thick bars and every time I go over a slight bump the trailer falls off the bike and lands in my rear wheel-very dangerous.I called the company and they sent me a new attachment that has a diffent mechanism, it did require drilling new holes through the bar but it has held on going over curbs and off road trails.I am now very pleased with the product and would buy it again."
3,Who's This For?,"For the musical fan, most of these will already be in their collection (""Hallelujah I'm a Bum"" has been issued and cheaply available, for instance). The rare films are so few that it's not cost-effective to buy the box set. So if you're an alien who dropped in a month ago and took a fancy to musical shows, this might be useful. I think that you'll see it heavily discounted after it doesn't sell well. There are plenty of rare musicals from those studios that could have made a terrific box set, and I hope they do one. A fan of Eddie Cantor is unlikely to enjoy the Elvis films, which I don't think Elvis liked a lot."
4,A Nice Introduction to Sheena Easton,"OK! So this 11-track EMI compilation-CD realised in 1989 doesn't include ""You Could Have Been With Me"" or ""Do It For Love"".And one can wonder why ""Wouldn't Beg For Water"" is included.But so what!A full 20-track compilation would be for die-hard fans only anyway. For others it would be too many songs.But for anyone who's just curious about Sheena Easton, or once where small fans, this CD gives a perfect impression and reminder of Sheena Easton.Most of her 80's hits and fine radio-friendly songs (mostly ballads) on EMI are included.It also shows the different styles Easton pursued during her career; the light catchy pop songs (""Morning Train"", ""Modern Girl""...), AC ballads (""For Your Eyes Only"", ""When He Shines""...), dance songs (""Strut""), country (""We've Got Tonight""), and R&B; (""Sugar Walls"").I highly recomend this CD!"
1,A truly terrible book,"Do not bother with this book -- it will be a waste of your time. If you like books with incredibly complex (and oftimes incomprehensible) milieus, try Iain M. Banks. If you like a touch of humor mized with action, try Charles Stross. If you like the in-depth human factor, try L.E. Modesitt. If you like a good, thought-provoking read, try David Brin. My book collection stands at about 1,000 and this Vinge was one of the worst. Full disclosure -- I could only get through Part One (about 170 pages); the last few pages of that section were so disappointing and illogically contrived that I simply could not go on and finish the remaining 600 pages. I gave it one star because the concept was fascinating, but the execution was awful."
4,a very good read but...,"A very good read and hard to put down. But. This story is a very good adventure of the old school. The characters are not particularly deep - quite cartoonish villains, near preternaturally gifted heroes and any number of implausibly gullible pawns. The broad thread of the plot (overall - not counting some fairly dramatic twists) is fairly predictable. Vernor Vinge's expertise though, both technically and socio-economically, is impressive. The universe is plausible and fascinating and Focus, 'Programmer-at-Arms' and the literally unavoidable rise and fall of civilisations stays with you. There is also an element of trust that, characters aside, the scenarios are all technically plausible. This *is* hard science fiction."
1,Truly a fiction..,Truly it is just a fiction.. Too much of feminism leaves the science behind. Don't buy if you want to read a true science fiction. Golden Age has a lot more to offer. Read Stanislaw Lem instead.
5,Truly Hard SciFi,"It doesn't get any better than this. Vinge has all the key elements for writing good scifi working for him, but he takes it to the next level here. The characters are very full and real. He does a wonderful job of humanizing the aliens and alienizing the humans so that by the end, even the ""bad guys"" have real understandable motives. The science is dead on, with just the right push into the theoretical to give you something to think about. As with all good scifi though, the star here isn't the science, it's the characters. I haven't read a book this good since Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars. One day it will be considered amongst the top scifi novels ever written."
1,Significant Rise in Blood Pressure,"This supplement caused significant rise in my blood pressure, even when I took half a dose. No significant symptom relief either. My advice - - - if you have blood pressure issues use with caution."
3,It could be a great game,"This could be such a great game if only the board had tiny grooves for the pieces. It is really easy for the pieces to move, which makes the game harder to play. With that said I am still glad we own this game and I do like playing it with my oldest daughter."
5,GREAT GAME,This game is sooooo awesome. My husband and I just love it. It's strategy and creativity to the max. After our son goes to bed we usually wip it out and get a game or two in.
2,what's with the lyrics?,"I really liked the first two albums, they were as good as ride or swervedriver. I bought this album on whim, and while some of the songs structures are interesting, most of it is pretty stock standard, but in particular the lyrics are woeful.Save your money, and purchase the new feeder album - pushing the senses."
3,needs to be remastered,"I agree with the previous reviewers in that there's no reason why all of the Classics IV material shouldn't be here. Also, you would think that EMI would add them to their fine Legendary Artists Series. I have Ricky Nelson's and Gary Lewis's EMI/LAS CDs and they are superior in sound quality to this one. That brings me to my complaint about this collection. This CD is in drastic need of a good remastering job! This CD is inexcusable for an artist of this caliber. The drums sound like they were recorded in a cave when you can hear them at all. Hopefully EMI will give this great group the same treatment that they have given to some of their other great artists."
4,This one made me think a bit,"First in the Frank Bennett Series.Frank Bennett is the new Police Chief of Trout Run, New York located in the picturesque Adirondacks.When perfect Janelle Harvey disappears Frank is called into action but always has the nagging fear that this case will turn out like the last one that caused him to ""retire"" early from his previous job. In this tight knit remote village, everyone knows everyone yet no one is willing to tell all that they know. What secrets are the town people keeping, who knows what and who is willing to tell what they know.As Frank delves deeper the multiple storylines come together in a conclusion that was right there in front of you but still had me guessing. I will definitely continue with this series."
1,not what expected,"The color of the chair is NOT what is pictured. It is tan and not bone which should be an ivory like color. In addition, the cushions are very hard and the material is rough and not soft."
5,allen 3 bike rack,"great rack, easy to assemble and use. would recomend a locking hitch pin so you don't need wrenches to attach and detach it from reciever and to make it more secure. we also use straps to stabilize it to the roof rack for that extra bit of stability but it isn't necessary"
3,"Quite learning, quite interesting.","Quite learning and quite interesting, well that pretty much covers it. You get an interesting look in to the craft and some of what you didn't know you are told."
5,Great as always.,"Waylander is an introspective look at ones man life painted in great detail through Mr. Gemmell's word-smithing. I found a number of great quotes, and action filled pages smattered throughout. I highly recommend this book."
5,Don't waste your money on anything else,"Nevermind the ""for the money"" reviews, for any amount this is a great TV set. Flat crystal clear screen, large enough size for any application, superb sound and as many in/out jacks as you could need. Anything comparable to this would be double the money. The channel change delay is barely noticeable. If you're one to spend wisely, as I am, you wouldn't buy anything else."
5,The Name Of the Game Is Speed,"Enter Mouse! Shampoo's admirer comes back to fight Ranma for her, but I doesn't happen that way. Instead whoever wins gets Akane! Not only that but Ranma is having a little trouble changing back into a man! The question is can he pull if off with help from his friends? Or will Akane be taken away? I highly recomend this movie! The plot is wonderful and you learn a lot more about your favorite characters! I gave it 5 stars!"
4,Very good value,Hard to believe these only cost me $39.00. The are a nice little set of speakers for my shelf. I have them hooked up to a Apple Airport Express base station and they work perfect. Nice clear sound and plenty of power to fill the room.
5,Very good product,"I bought this for my Palm and Camera SD cards. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. With XP - no software needed, just like any flash drive. Plug and go. It works great on my homebuilt PC's front-panel USB ports. I have had a couple of problems using it on Dells at work, due mainly to the lousy front-panel designs of our desktops. I have to plug it in the rear ports of the dells. Making the device longer, or angled towards the front end to help clear the ports would solve the problem, BUT - it would make it bigger, and the compact size is why I bought the unit.Five stars for the product, and for the company."
3,Unexpected ending,This novel is a quick read with an unexpected ending. Loosely based on actual events it gives a chilling look at serial killers.
1,"Horrible Dog House, DO NOT BUY!","I bought this for my 15lb puppy under the assumption that it could hold up for simp rain and wind protection, I was wrong. Not only was the assembly rediculously difficult(none of the pieces lined up correctly, and the screws didnt even hold it together),my puppy ended up sleeping under my bed when it rained due to the fact that the house was flooded. To make matters worse, my puppy decided she wanted to get ontop of the crappy house. She ended up breaking it and getting cut...now I'm paying for a vet bill to stitch her up, extremely useless and dangerous for anything over 10lbs."
2,boring,"I thought this was supposed to have a tour inside the capitol, but there was just one room. It was long and boring."
4,"David Barton has done some very good Christian, Constituional videos...","This is one of them. Barton has backslidin recent years with the 'Judeo-Christian'watered down crowd, however. This remainsone of his best. Get your copies while youstill can. He and Dr. D. James Kennedy arehowever incorrect on Thomas Jefferson notbeing a Christian and on George Washingtonwho was NOT a Mason. Why they and Mike Hof-fman II and W.A. Carto believe the Masonicb.s. (bologna sauce) out there on those twois beyond me. Can you say (Neo)CONservativesellout?!"
3,pellet is big for 6 inch turtle,"The pellet size is big for 6-inch turtle.The pellet was NOT attract as other food.However, it keep my turtle alive and the price is right."
4,Great nutrition for adult turtles!!,"I gave this 4 stars because the size of the pellets are a little big. But other than that, nutrition is great for adult sliders! 25% protein? That's possibly the lowest I've seen in commercial turtle food. And that's a good thing. Also packed with lots of vitamins and minerals. I really like it and I feel safe knowing that my adult is healthy eating this product.Another thing, but not sure if it's just my turtle but - the first couple of times feeding my slider, he didn't know how to eat it so it broke up into thousands of pieces. But later, he learned to eat the whole thing in one bite.Just my experiences with it"
2,Not my turtles' taste,I've been feeding my turtles with this for a few months now but I found my turtles still prefer the Fluker's Turtle Food from Doctors Foster and Smith as I mixed a little of the old ones with this new brand. They always go for the old ones. I also found these are a little too small and hard for the turtles to see them.
5,A complete handbook for the aspiring improv actor,"Improvisation For Actors And Writers: A Guidebook For Improv Lessons In Comedy by Bill Lynn is a complete handbook for the aspiring improv actor and organized into five specific sections: Comedy Schools; Improv Comedy Basics; Developing Comic Characters; Long Form Improv; and Writing Sketch Comedy. This informed and informative ""how to"" manual is enhanced with an extensive appendix of improv exercises. Improvisation For Actors And Writers is a clearly valuable addition to theatre department reference collections and ""must"" reading for anyone who has an interest in writing or performing improv on the stage or for television."
4,Good overview for budding comedians in the art of improv,A good short book that provides ample exercises to help individuals interested in the art of improv.
4,Good Yoga,"Different, challenging in some ways. Good. Some unique undulating movements, a lot of circular motions. I'd probably feel more enthusiastic about it if I were better at those types of movements, and then I'd feel like giving it 5 stars."
2,"Waay too kinetic for the ""yoga"" I expected!","I would tend to agree with the reviews that stated that this wasn't yoga....Not at all what I expected. While the cinematography is beautifully breathtaking, the movements are rather abstract and extremely hard to follow. I was hoping for some poses, or perhaps fluid transitions between poses, but I got completely lost in the ""whirling dervish"" aspect of it all. It contained nothing solid I could base my practice on, even though the introduction seemed very interesting and engaging. Also - unless you're doing this in a huge ballroom, it is very difficult to do if you have limited space."
4,A Few Bugs But A Great Price,"Being able to bash things is obviously fun, but some of the excitement is taken away when a piece pops out of place. Still, you can't beat bashin' stuff.There's not much to educational value, though you do have to assemble it, so I guess there's practice on reading and following directions.Though pieces popping out does detract from durability, it's got toughness. I pulled back on the lever to make the arm bash and, though I thought I snapped something, it was fine. (BTW, it's better to use the lever on the other side of the vehicle to move the arm).Overall, you can't beat paying so little for a MotU vehicle."
5,Swing is back and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's got it!,"Thank God for real music! The revival of 'swing' by contemporary artists such as BBVD has opened up this great music to an entire generation of young music fans who are now getting an earful of what real music ought to be. BBVD, Brian Setzer Orchestra, Cherry-Poppin Daddies, and Royal Crown Revue are all putting out some really terrific sounds with a swing beat, and this CD is at the top of the pack. If you want to check out what all the ruckus about 'swing' is today, buy this CD and let BBVD show you. It's a five-star performance! Greetings from Count Basie's Home Town."
5,BBVD Are The Kings Of Swing,I bought this cd as soon as it came out after falling in love with the band's music on the Swingers soundtrack. From the first time I put the cd on I have loved it. I've seen the band twice in concert and while the cd doesn't capture their live dynamic show it's definitely the coolest. I have other swing bands on cd but BBVD is the hippest and the heppest of them all. They are wonderful and don't have that underlying SKA sound like Cherry Poppin' Daddies does. They are swing to the maximum. I could just pop this cd in and put it on repeat. The best track for upbeat jivin is Jumpin' Jack it just makes you want to dance all over the place and to mellow things down a bit so you can recoup after the high energy swinging just listen to The Maddest Kind Of Love which speaks straight from the heart. For the true lounge sound Please Baby nails it on the head. BBVD never cease to entertain or please.
5,Excellent Swing Music!,I picked up this CD because I heard them play on Letterman. It's well worth the money! I listen to it all all the time.
1,Make it stop,"This music is like bubble gum pop that won't quit. Please make it stop. This has got to be the 'whitest' sound since Lawrence Welk. If that's your thing, enjoy. I'm white, and this isn't my thing. Otherwise, if I never hear it again, I'll be very happy."
5,Loved it.,"I live in a cave, and didn't even know there was such a thing as swing revival, but this album was great and I plan to buy more of BBVD music ASAP. I especially like how authentic the style is."
5,Bbvd IS swing,".BBVD is the best 90s swing band. I've been waiting for a Big Band revival, but I never thought it would A) Turn into such a huge trend, or B) Produce such good original music. Unlike the Cherry Poppin' Daddies or Squirrel Nut Zippers, BBVD is both uncomprimising swing with 90s sensibility AND in possession of some reeelly good original songs. I think they're too retro to be radio-friendly forever, but let's enjoy them while they're here!This cd has no holes.--------Note to lovers of this type o' music:Another album you're sure to enjoy but probably won't hear of is The W's. Like BBVD, they have great swing sense, but unlike BBVD they are sanitized from any tootooforties tendencies (with the possible exception of the song ""Frank""). If you're into this stuff and are short on cash, BBVD and The W's are the absolutely most perfect two cds available now."
4,Really Good CD,"Except for one track, every song on this CD wants to set your feet to dancing. A really good CD to listen to. My individual track ratings are:1. The Boogie Bumper -- 4 Stars2. Mr. Pinstripe Suit -- 4 Stars3. King Of Swing -- 4 Stars4. Minnie The Moocher -- 4 Stars5. You & Me & The Bottle Makes 3 Tonight (Baby) -- 5 Stars6. Jump With My Baby -- 4 Stars7. Maddest Kind Of Love -- 3 Stars8. Go Daddy-O -- 4 Stars9. Please Baby -- 2 Stars10. Mambo Swing -- 4 Stars11. Jumpin' Jack -- 4 Stars12. So-Long-Farewell-Goodby! -- 3 Stars"
4,"Good, but I've heard better.","This album starts really well with some great tunes like 'Mr Pinstripe' and 'The King of Swing'. The music in their cover of 'Minnie the Moocher' is superb but Scott's voice spoils it slightly.Also, the CD kind of fizzles out towards the end.Saying that, 'Maddest kind of love' is probably the best track.If you want a current swing album, buy 'Zoot suit Riot' by the Cherry poppin' daddies, it has more feeling, more intelligent and meaningful lyrics and Steve Perry's vocals are more dynamic.Big Bad voodoo Daddy are going places, it's just that Cherry Poppin' Daddies are going to get there first."
4,Swing-a-delic,"This CD was the first of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy that i bought and i enjoyed it! The best song on the cd was Boogie Bumper! If you like swing, you'll love this!"
1,Quality stinks!,"If you don't mind reading a book that you can see both sides of the page at once, this one's for you! I've purchased and read thousands of books over the past 40+ yrs. and never had one like this. Shame on you Oxford University Press, and specifically Oxford India Paperbacks. I can't comment on the story itself as I won't be reading it."
3,"This can help, but . . .","When I received ""Reading & Speaking About Russian Newspapers (Focus Texts Series), I quickly looked it over from front to back. It can help some people who want to read small articles or ads. However, it does not adress more advanced topics and articles in a way that is useable as other than a ""quick"" activity book for a little while. The newspaper texts and ads are severely outdated and I sort of felt like I was scrutinizing the lowest literature that the former Soviet Union would let out in the old days, like during Stalin! This text needs some serious updating. Also, it could be divided into areas of interests as well that people would enjoy: pets, history, politics, music, school, work, entertainment etc."
1,Crude writer,Never got past the first ten pages. Crude depictions of women as body parts turned me off.Pretty foul language. Better writers don't need to use such tactics to present realistic gritty characters.
5,"Just as good as the first one, if not better...","There were so many great songs in Boogie Nights, and not all of them could fit onto the first one. This much-needed addition is just as good (if not better) than the first one, and I've found that I actually to this one more. My favorites are Mama Told Me Not To Come (Three Dog Night), You Sexy Thing (Hot Chocolate), Boogie Shoes (KC & The Sunshine Band), Driver's Seat (Sniff 'n' the Tears), Feel Too Good (The Move), and Jessie's Girl (Rick Springfield). If you like the original soundtrack I'd definitely recommend getting this one too, and vice versa."
2,I want my time back,"I expected a low budget film, so that wasn't the issue. The storyline just dragged. Started pretty well and the ending was interesting. It's the hour in the middle that was not good. The story is about time travel and I wish I could go back in time and get the time I spent watching this movie back."
1,bleh,"When I saw this, I thought well, why not? I out why, this movie was simply aweful. Do not waste your time."
2,Not Impressed with Seven Seas Scent,"As a self proclaimed beauty expert (read I spend way too much on products) I can honestly say I am not impressed at all with this soap. The smell is ok, not suberb, not knock glam up a notch, just ok. I can get ok from drugstore soap for a lot less.As for it moisturizering or doing any other added benefits that would make me run out and re-purchase. Nope. None. Zilch. Just another bar soap, with an ok scent, an ok lather and that's absolutely it."
2,Bland,"I' m used to the wonderful smell of both Balinese Vanilla and Almond Milk, and this smell paled in comparison."
1,Monitoring System,"I would suggest that if you have a wireless router in your home for your PC / Computer than this product would not be the best monitoring system. Why, because it interferes with transmission from wireless devices such as a router which run on 2.4 GHz.I had problems displaying the video to the point where I could get a clear picture through the monitor."
1,definatly not what I thought,"Did not fit well AT ALL. WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off. They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle. They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing. I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day. I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper."
2,like walkingin MOON BOOTS,I just received these boots yesterday and wore them all day.I have some pros but the most important is the con. They are huge & I feel like I am walking in moon boots. I am not referring to shoe size but overall appearance and feel. I own 3 other similiar boots and these are the worst by far.Pros - the color. I wanted a chestnut color boot and this color is perfect. The quality is 100%. The suede and shearling inside is great and they are very soft and comfortable (when not walking). the price was great too! especially b/c the quality is great.I ordered the size 9 based on previous customers. I am normally an 8 or 81/2. if they made these in an 8 1/2 that probably would have fit me but i am happy i ordered up.I am only keeping these boots b/c I do not want the hassle of a return. If I had seen this in a store i would have tried it on but not purchased it b/c of the huge look to them!I was going to order another pair in black but am happy I did not!
4,Also didn't need to buy larger,"I love the boot but I wear a half size (7.5) so I had to go all the way up to a size 9. Too big, I think an 8.5 would have been perfect. Otherwise, great item. The sheepskin is sooooo soft and cozy!"
4,Buy big!,"Having read the reviews before I bought these boots I decided to size up from my usual 8.5 to a 10 - I'm pleased I did, they're a perfect fit."
4,Indie Rock at it's finest,"It is so refreshing to find band's like Tiara in this day and age of substance-free pop music. This cd provides guitar-driven indie rock with soft vocals. Finest moments come duing ""Washington"" where listener's wonder who the lead singer's ""Jennifer Appleseed"" really is. Tiara's sound is alive and non-studio perfected; you feel as though your listening to them from the depth of some tiny dive-bar, as they rock out on a tiny stage. If you are sick of the glut of boy bands and rock/rap hybrids give Tiara a try...they're music making at it's most innocent and pure level."
4,I am a huge Gemmell fan.....,"I love all of Gemmells work and with the completion of this book, i have now read them all. the story is great, the characters are developed enough, but i just felt that this one lacked a little something. dont get me wrong, i enjoyed it and recomend it to any fantasy readers. (maybe it lacked his usual blood and guts that i enjoy in a book). i give this book 4 stars, but if you want just a stand alone book, something that is not part of a tedious series, than this is the book for you."
2,nice looking with poor speakerphone,"This phone worked well, but, in less than 6 months, the speakerphone faded in and out, to the point where it was not possible to hear the incoming message at times. I obtained a replacement, but the replacement phone did the same thing. Other people have reported similar experiences in their reviews."
2,"Nice ""Human design"" and features, BUT speakerphone problems","First let me say that the speakerphone produces plenty of volume, much better than most other phones I have tried. This was especially important since I often participate on nightly conference calls overseas where low receive level is often a problem.However, there is one major problem that might be related to poor design or manufacturing variation. (I have 3 of these phones). If another person picks up an extension in another part of the house while using the 972 speakerphone, the 972 speaker will cut in and out often introducing an annoying clicking sound for all parties listening. The amount of muting and clicking is differs significantly between the 3 phones I own. In the worst case, the speakerphone is totally muted and I can't hear anything."
2,The Complete Guide to Foreign Adoption,"The title and subtitle are misleading; this is not a guide to foreign adoption but rather a compendium of horror stories about the worst Romanian orphan case histories. The slant is negative, journalistically sensationalist, and repetitive. Although the subject is of interest, the book is not a guide to the process of adoption, and has very little helpful information to offer.The focus is on the authors' good works in Romania with special needs toddlers and the book offers very little practical advice to those interested in adopting healthy infants or children internationally. Look elsewhere for guidance."
3,Memories from a flash in the pan,"So after I lost all of my CDs in a burglary, one of my friends helpfully thought to get my new music collection started with...MC Hammer! Popping it into the CD player reminded me why MC Hammer was super-cool for about a year and a half.It's an uneven album. There are some great, if dated, songs on this album. ""U Can't Touch This"" really was good, and ""Pray"" has worn surprisingly well. On the other hand, some of the other songs, like ""Crime Story"" and ""Have You Seen Her"" are just plodding. And the album ends really weakly, with hardly any rapping on ""Let's Go Deeper"" and ""Work This.""If you buy CDs for just one or two songs, there's some nostalgia value here, and you'll have the only car on the block with MC Hammer blasting out your windows. On the other hand, it's really not an album to listen to in its entirety, even if you're on a nostalgia trip."
5,the best game ever now that kung lao and kitana are back!,"man you need this game you want this game hell,you feel this game! without a doubt this is the best game ever!and all ya'll mortal kombat haters suck!this game is bad to the bone.i wish shao kahn and goro were not dead,because they were some of the best fighters of all time god damn it!i love this game see all three fighting styles?one of the best new featers!23 charecters?cold ass dudes!man this game is very good!if you want to know more about this game,look at the already-on mortal kombat review i wrote! get this game forget renting!get this game now right now!i mean it!oh yeah,scorpion 4 life!"
5,Why is it rated M???????????????????,there isnt anything that bad in it I think that it should be rated T not M! Alot of kids who love mortal kombat are not allowed to get this game just because its rated M! Oh and if you like this buy Soul Calibur II ande III! Also buy Castlevania: Curse of darkness!P.S : thats rated M too but its another stupid call on the ratings should be rated T!
2,Best to wait for MK6,"At least that one may be a complete game. The graphics are great and the fighting average. As a Mortal Kombat game it truly disappoints. Many things that were to be included were suddenly left out due to ""time constraints"". The game itself has clues to many of these items, which is really annoying considering they are no longer present. Wait for MK6 and avoid the feeling of being cheated into buying an unfinished product."
3,Not as good as it seems.,"I'm not one to care about graphics,but this game is just odd. The blood squirts,and makes odd noises,plus it looks rather silly. The fatalities aren't as good as their predecessors. They're over the top,and not as fun to look at.However,this game is pretty true to it's predecessors."
2,capitol collectors series,Nothing much to justify this Sinatra release. The addition of one track is insufficient to have re-released this compilation.
5,this shirt is too kewl.....,"Wolf t-shirts rock, man! This wolf shirt is a prime example of a cotton aphrodisiac.........True cheap way to experience chick magnetism.Only one wolf would have done it.....but three wolves? Gotta go...looks like Pamela Anderson is callin' my celly."
5,Twilgiht Moon Wolves T,Imagine if when you looked at that t-shirt from the side the faces became Jacob/Taylor Lautner and 2 other wolf-people from the Twilight movies nobody knows the names of.
5,At first nothing but then.....,"I recieved this shirt as a 33rd birthday present from a coworker. After reading all the crazy reviews we all had a good laugh in the office when I put it on. To be honest, I really didn't feel any different however, little did I know, it was just a matter of time. Later that day nature called and I answered, as I stood up to take care of the paperwork in the stall, something glimmered in the bottom of the bowl. It turned out to be solid 24K gold. True story."
2,A Serious Review,"I was hoping to turn my coolness quotient up to 11 as I wore this shirt around places, Wal-mart, and stuff. Instead, I returned it because of its poor quality. The fabric is scratchy and thin. Worse, the neck hole is an inch off center, which makes the collar constantly ride up on one side. This would have worked if my neck was an inch off center, but it isn't. One star because of the quality issues; one more star because it's got three wolves. And a moon."
1,lacks actual wolf hair,"Yeah, the shirt's ok. But I would have preferred that it be made from actual wolf hair."
5,"My Favorite T-Shirt, By Far","I'm a professional so I don't often wear T-Shirts but when I do, this is the one I reach for at least 6 times out of 10. I've actually been thinking of giving my other shirts to Goodwill and buying 3 more of these to replace them. They're that nice! I can't believe the compliments I get on it every time!"
5,Dave Weart owns one of these shirts,"This shirt is incredible. My boy Dave Weart was wearing one the other day and miraculously he breast-fed a flamingo back to health. Not only that but this shirt made him so virile, he sired a baseball team. An orchestra if you count the bastards.And as for me, I now jog a mile and a half a day with a refrigerator on my back thanks to this shirt.5 stars. Buy this shrt."
2,Offensive to Werewolves!,"I find this shirt very offensive. I mean, why do people always depict wolves howling at the moon.Hi, I'm a Werewolf, and it sickens me when people don't take into account the other great things that we do. We are really good at marking our territory (trees and fire hydrants), dig holes, bury our victims, scratch our head with our feet, and can survive anything save of coarse silver bullets.Personally, I wouldn't be so upset about this oversight is only there were shirts for us werewolves depicting humans doing what they do best... tasting delicious. I'm not sure how best to convey this... oh, maybe a scratch and taste shirt! Mmmm"
1,!!NOT FOR ASTRONAUTS!!,"Do not purchase if you are planning on exiting the Earth's atmosphere. The consequences will be catastrophic. Whatever you do, do not step foot on the moon while wearing this shirt."
5,Great Wolf Shirt,"Great wolf shirt. Colorful & in great detail. I don't know about the trailer guy that wears his wolf shirt to Walmart, and attracts the opposite sex... but I enjoy the shirt for what it is, and do not get into delusionary things like he did! It must be tough to be so lonely, that a wolf shirt attracts women 4 teeth. One thing about him owning that wonderful wolf shirt,....Once he puts it on, it'll NEVER smell the same! (What a catch!)"
4,The power in the wrong hands...,I got this shirt for my friend Ricky in hopes the wolves would protect him from his wife who is trying to make him have a fourth child.Unfortunately it had an adverse reaction and Ricky is now the defendent in three paternity cases stemming from the one day he wore the shirt. BEWARE THE POWER of the three wolves shirt. Ricky had to burn his rather than risk more children/cases. Only wear this shirt if you are fully prepared for the booty meat it will bring.
5,Legendary,"I wore this shirt to work, and my manager immediately gave me a raise because ""[I am] a leader and a role model for this company."" Thank you, three wolf moon shirt."
1,HIGHLY UNSTABLE TSHIRT,"I totally used to have this shirt but then I had to put it in a chest and bury it on a deserted isle because it was leaking radiation, causing a nuclear facility near me to be mistakenly shut down. Before I hid this mighty piece of apparel, I took it to a top nuclear research laboratory where I was told the leaking radiation was due to the glowing aura of awesomeness emanating from the shirt. Apparently, it was permeating the atomic structure of surrounding elements in the environment, and disintegrating the subatomic structures, thereby effectively causing a maelstrom of highly reactive positron and quark emissions. Perhaps God could have overcome this drawback if he had designed this shirt with less wolves."
5,Wolf Advisor,"When learning to harness the full power of a shirt with three wolves on it, the uninitiated new wearer will often need advice. Thankfully, WOLF ADVISOR is now available for iPhone and iPod Touch to help the new wearer learn to think and make decisions like the wolf!! Make your transformation complete and never be caught off-guard as a simple poser who only wears the shirt!! Get WOLF ADVISOR for your iPhone or iPod Touch today!!"
1,No Freaking Flag,This shirt does not have a confederate flag on it. Everyone knows that wold shirts have to have a confederate flag on them. This one doesn't. What does it have on it. A big round disc. What flag has a big round disc on it. The Japanese flag. WWII taught us not to trusst them. Dont wear this shirt with Japanese wolves on it.The south will rise again.
2,Not as advertised!,My THREE WOLF MOON SHIRT ADULT SIZE M came without instructions and to date I have yet to see it do anything. I am very dissapointed and will not be buying any more software from this company.
5,Awesomeness ensued...,"I recently received a 3 wolf moon shirt as a Christmas gift from my newly-deemed Awesome boss. Immediately upon putting the shirt on I felt a warmth envelope me. I was soon to realize that the warmth was that of awesomeness. This awesomeness was a feeling I had not felt before. I did not know what to do with it. However, I did have an overwhelming desire to go to my office window and Howl. And howl I did. I was trying to absorb the glow from earth's yellow sun. I wanted the shirt to glow in the dark to reveal its true inner awesomeness. Unfortunately, I was unable to make it glow this time. I will keep trying and have faith that its true glory of awesomeness will ensue soon... Keep posted. I will post again once the glow is at its peak and I know the true meaning of life!"
4,So...,"I got this shirt, at WalMart for $7.00.I'm a chick. I guess it only attracts straight chicks, because I haven't attracted any chicks.It's still a nice shirt though."
5,wolf shirts are amazing,"after purchasing this wolf shirt i immediately started craving beer. so i called the whitehouse knowing they serve beer and scheduled a sleepover in the lincoln bedroom with any available intern(female). all i can say , and this aint no lie , is that i was the best deal ever. not the shirt just the intern! oh baby!"
5,QUESTION,"Is it righteous to be jealous of my 3WM T if it has more -- and I mean, a whole lot more -- luck with the ladies than I do?Answer me now or Senor Lobo dies."
4,Good gift,So my wife likes the Twilight movie and the new one with the wolfpack so I got her this shirt. She hasn't worn it yet but keeps telling me she loves it. So I logged on to facebook under a different name (like I always do to get info) and chatted with her. Turns out she thinks it's lame and plans to burn it. So I couldnt give the full 5 stars.
5,Will these go well with my flip flops>,"I recently purchased some flip flopshttp://www.amazon.com/Eastbay-Basic-Flip-Flop-Mens/dp/B000EGTIW6/ref=pd_ybh_1?pf_rd_p=280800601&pf;_rd_s=center-2&pf;_rd_t=1501&pf;_rd_i=ybh&pf;_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf;_rd_r=074D3R51C78X27Y39TR9There was something magical about them, I was wondering if anyone here could help me know if this shirt is really magical like my sandals, Willy my body explode if I wear both at the same time?"
2,It works ok.,I got this shirt to hang on my wall. I thought it would be perfect for rolling or tripping. NEG! It is wack and does not glow in the dark or fluorescen under black light. Now all I got is a t-shirt with 3 wolves on it.
5,love,always loved wolfs and to display this art is amazing so many people ask where I got it and they like it
1,This shirt ruined my life.,"I bought this shirt from this site without reading the reviews and now, my life is pretty much over. It's just me and my disability check in this cozy trailer from now on.It was just, like, I saw the shirt when I was looking to buy my boyfriend a gift for his birthday. The wolves... they, like, called to me from the webpage and I pushed the one click button immediately. And when it arrived and I was wrapping it for my man, I kept touching it thinking, ""he is going to look soooooooooooooooooo hot in this shirt. Look at all those HOWLING WOLVES! One wolf would have been pretty sexy, but three of them? That's so triple of the sexy!He loved it, of course, and then he went and wore it to the bar. Three days later, he came back to our trailer, packed his bag, and left me for one of the many ladies that were drawn to him and the ""magical"" shirt. Magical for him, maybe... but not to ME. I'm so lost without him.I hate you, wolf shirt."
4,I also purchased the Zubaz pants.,"Hello,After seeing what other people (the one's who had purchased this shirt) had purchased, I also decided to buy a pair of the Zubaz pants, and they are very comfortable. I was also impressed with the tag inside the shirt. They're normally scratchy and cause severe chaffing and irritation. This tag was so comfortable, I wish they had put more!I'm also going to paint my van (the one with the sunset over mesas on it) with the wolf image. It's too cool!"
2,The demise of humans in the form of an awsome shirt,"I am a man who walked the earth and did so for the past 200 years, I have no recollection of my origins but know that the northern forests once were my home. I came across a wise man in the desert plains who offered this shirt as a token of friendship, I have worn it ever since.Now, I'm a bussiness owner with a Malibu mansion and a fleet of 1950's to 1969 model Ferraris, women who pay me in the high 4 figures to lay with me and a private aircraft to get into my Tahoe retreat.Yes, the shirt gives you the richess of the earth, but now I know, that the price was my soul, and that the desert man was the evil one incarnated.Why 2 stars?... The Ferraris are pretty cool!"
1,"dont believe it, no powers come with this shirt","After reading the reviews i ordered a dozen of these hoping to either bring my wife back from the dead or at the very least meet the wolf god who took her. Neither of these happened. Nothing has happened. Nothing ever happens, and I don't know why expect online purchases to plug the hole in my heart. Nothing has, nothing will, and certainly not some wolves howling at the moon."
3,Ideally...,"This shirt is a good example of wolf-themed couture, but there are a number of irksome flaws that mire the aesthetic appeal and therefore negate its potential as a paradigm of lupine apparel. I don't have the time to go into all the glaring deficits as I am on a Rockstar brand energy drink fueled spirit journey to find silk-screened nirvana,but let me leave you with this : not ONE of these wolves has a single ear pierced with a dream catcher earring. Not ONE."
5,I am awesome now,"If Thor The God Of Thunder rode to your house on the back of a Mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex and played ""Rock You Like A Hurricane"" on a 50-foot long Gibson made of golden skulls while the Blue Angels Navy Jet Fighter Squadron did battle above in a raging thunderstorm with Large Breasted Valkyrie Women as Satan Himself rendered the vocals with the screams of a billion doomed souls, it would still only be about half as awesome as I am with this shirt on.Also, it is fairly comfy."
1,Where is the Lightning?,"One issue I have with this shirt is the total lack of lightning. I will take the flying eagle with a stormy background shirt over this one any day. If it had three eagles, even better."
2,False Advertising,I felt slightly ripped off when I received my tee shirt orderonly to discover that the wolf images portrayed on the shirt were actually Siberian Huskys! WTF
2,Purchase with care,"I purchased the `Three Wolves' t-shirt for my fiancé Mary as a one year anniversary present to celebrate our vow of chastity leading up to our marriage.You can only imagine my surprise when she came to me only days later and told me that she was with child. She tearfully swore that she had not broken her vow. Apparently, she had worn the `Three Wolves' tshirt in bed. God appeared to her that night in the form of Kevin Costner and they laid together. Her story was borne out by our doctor, who described Mary's conception as nothing sort of `miraculous'.I have given the shirt only two stars, as although I am blessed to soon become the father of the Son of God, saviour of mankind, this is a little more than I expected when I purchased the tshirt. Furthermore, it is a shame the tshirt does not have more wolves on the sleeves."
5,The T-Shirt left town,"I bought this shirt for a friend who has been down on his luck lately. I thought, if the hype was to be believed, that Three Wolf Moon would give him back the confidence he needed to take control of his life. The shirt arrived and my friend put it in the drawer for about a week. When we decided to hit the town and test out the powers of the Three Wolf Moon my friend went to get it out of the drawer and found it missing. In its place was a note that read, ""You're not ready for 3 wolves, putting me on would be too dangerous. Try starting with one wolf. I'm leaving to find someone more worthy. Best of Luck, 3WM""The shirt hasn't been heard from or seen since, however, there has been a rise in coyotes wandering my friend's neighborhood so I suspect it can't be far off."
5,gift from the gods,"when i got this shirt i didnt believe all the talk but now i see the error of my ways. as i put the shirt on i felt the strength of 300 spartans coursing through my veins. my ability to fly gained i flew around just to get a feel for its awsomness. as i landed i was swarmed by an over abundance of women who all wanted to join my one man wolf pack. amused by the power of the shirt i decided to find sylvester stallone to test the might of this shirt and yes with all my gained abilitys i destroyed stallone. after all the battle i needed to recharge so i went to a local bar and as i entered everyone marveled at my 3wolfmoon tee i just smiled and went about my business, when the bartender asked me what i wanted with fear in his voice i told him with a mighty wolf howl all of it. now im heading home proud of my 1st day with the gift from the gods 3wof moon tee thinking how my day went and had to write this review. the 3 wolf moon tee changed my life..."
5,My chest set on fire!,"The moment my hands touched the sweet half polyester three wolf t-shirt Thor, god of thunder, came down from the heavens and bequeathed his hammer to me. I then began to smite everyone around me in the wal-mart and costco parking lot with raging thunderbolts of justice. Needless to say, 60 year grandmas all around me were swooning at my dashing baseball helmet with 2 beers attached, and of course my three wolf T-Shirt. I then erupted into flames and assumed control of the world. MUST BUY!"
1,wolf man t shirt,"I don't know yet since I gave it to my granddaughter, but she did ask for it. 3 3 3"
1,Warning,"My brother and I both got the shirt, one time he put on both of ours at the same time. He's dead now."
1,Completely Bogus!,"I've owned and have been wearing this shirt for nine days straight now and as of this writing it has NOT reunited me with my estranged father, nor cured my insistent bed wetting as was promised on the tag.It DID get me the number to this SMOKIN' HOT redhead that lives down the street, but I really don't like redheads (more into blonds), so even in that respect it doesn't work that well... What a complete bust. I can't believe I sold my eyes on the black market so I could outbid some smuck on eBay for this. What a waste of $1,765.43 and a perfectly good set of eyes!!!Oh, well -- live 'n learn.Shirt *is* machine washable."
1,Nothing happened,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided I needed one of these shirts. After receiving it, I put it on and was I ever disappointed -- because unlike what happened to everyone else, nothing happened. In fact, more of nothing happened than ever didn't happen before. Returning shirt."
1,The shirt is a lie!,"So, I bought one of these shirts, and all I can say is it's a pack of lies. My luck with the ladies didn't change at all, everything stayed the same. The other reviews are all lies, it doesn't do what everyone says it would!!! Don't buy one if that's the reason you wanted to buy one!"
2,NIce meme,"I wonder how many people actually bought this shirt that reviewed it. Its not a bad shirt, Ive seen better though."
4,"A ""classic"" tee",I got this wolf moon shirt for my husband for his birthday. He had seen someone wearing it in a movie (maybe Will Ferrell?). He kept commenting how that shirt was great. He was elated when he opened his gift and put it on immediately. He thinks of it as a comical novelty and enjoys his new tshirt.
1,Only get this shirt if you want to be lame like Kari W,"This morning, as usual, I was all excited for casual Fridays and getting to wear jeans to the office. But when I got into the office, this girl Kari W. was totally wearing the three wolves and the moon shirt (looks like someone took ""casual Friday"" a step too far!). At first I was like, ""Dang, that shirt is the shizzy!"" But my moment of admiration quickly faded when I realized that it was Kari and her lame buttface who was wearing it. I mean seriously, she would take an awesome thing like thing this t-shirt and make it lame. I only recommend this product if you want to be as lame or as much of a buttface as my coworker KW."
5,Im Sexy and I Know it.,I pretty much gave this shirt 5 stars because of the ungodly amounts of vagina that it attracted once I dawned it. 60% of the time it works everytime. Once I spray on my sex panther im pretty much unstoppable!
2,Buyer beware,"Don't buy this shirt if you are planning on driving a car. You'll get so distracted by your own shirt wolves, you'll run your pick up straight into a pile of dirty leaves, which wouldn't be so much of a problem on its own except that you'll leave the car running, which will ignite the leaves and eventually the truck. Buyer beware."
2,Needs a warning,"I purchased this shirt with the expectation that it would bless me with similar experiences as the other reviewers.It should have come with a warning label.Those of us unfamiliar with the power of this shirt may well regret the purchase.I have previously owned a single wolf shirt, as well as a wolf and eagle shirt, and a shirt with two wolves (though one on the front and one on the back). I've never owned a three wolf shirt before this. And frankly, I wasn't ready for it.The story is complicated, and my lawyer has advised me that discussing it could compromise my legal position, but simply allow me to say that two broken arms and a bruised chest later, I wish that I had understood what it meant to get a THREE wolf shirt.If you have experience with three wolf shirts, I think this would be excellent. If, like me, you are wolf noob, you may want to start with a two wolf, or perhaps two wolves and cub shirt, to be sure you're up to the task."
4,Great Shirt!!!!,"In terms of attracting women this shirt was way more effective than my WWF Summer Slam Undertaker vs Kamala Casket match shirt. Breathes well, and wisks away sweat like a Under Armour shirt!"
2,Only 42 two-star reviews for this product is dangerous.,"I just saved all your lives. This product has a curse on it that is activated if 42 people find this product to be unworthy of 3 stars but just better than 1 star. If left that way for more than a few days or weeks, the shirt's powers will be amplified until we are all overwhelmed by it's intense awesomeness, and Chuck Norris will be whipped into a frenzy of unstoppable roundhouse kicks until the world has learned to appreciate this shirt's finer nuances and respect it and themselves enough to write more 2 star reviews for it. No need to thank me, though, I was only able to accomplish this feat because of wearing the 3 wolf moon short sleeve tee and being enlightened by it's wisdom and counsel. You're welcome."
3,Mixed feelings,"I had read the reviews and seen the video, so I was very excited when my shirt finally arrived last Friday. As a shirt, it was perfectly good. I especially liked the length of it, and it was, as mentioned in other reviews, quite effective in covering girthiness.I wore it to the store with pride, and awaited the comments as I went into a nerd central (local game store). But no one noticed. I was bitterly disappointed. Family members pointed out that perhaps folks HAD noticed and were just too polite to mention, but still....UPDATE: I was in Silverton, CO a few days ago, and saw a FOUR WOLF MOON tee!! Can it get any better????"
5,Walked one thousand miles to be with me,"I purchased the 3 wolf moon shirt while on vacation in Utah but I forgot it in the hotel room. Imagine my surprise when 7 weeks later, I heard a knock at my door back home. It was 3 wolf moon! It walked all the way to my house by itself. Excellent fit, too."
3,I gave the 3 star for the Picture,"The Picture was great, but the color of the shirt is toward green instead of black. I was like little disappointed on the material too."
5,"Inside this shirt, I feel like an 80's Heavy Metal Vinyl Record!",I surpassed my Guitar Hero score... My vocal range has increased... Side effect: tendency to bite bats.
1,Never Receiced,"Never received this item...ordered it in May. I contacted them 2 wks after their shipping date. They're reason for delay is they don't know what happens after it enter usps,but we will reship the item. Another 2wks later contact them again after not receiving and it was the same exact email. It has to be autamated email. Finally just said forget it and filed complaint with amazon.com."
1,Doesn't meet my expectations,"The biggest shirt they had fit me horribly tightly, so much so that the wolves look that they're howling in pain from being so tightly smashed and stretched against the boundaries of the shirt and my stomach. The moon looks warped and distorted from the sagging weight of my breast adding to the corrupt ambiance. Do not believe the reviews. Never trust the furries. Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff Yiff"
2,WRONG FORMAT,"WON'T PLAY ON MY CD PLAYER & WHEN I EMAILED THE DUDE HE SAID I WAS A NUT. I""M LIKE, WTF MAN EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS THAT EVEN GRANDMA & MR CHRISTIE FROM UP THE STREET WHO LOOKS OVER THE FENCE BUT IT CAME WITH A PRETTY COOL SHIRT"
2,What would make it better,"I like this shirt okay, but in the dark no one can see it so it loses some impact. I think it could be a better shirt if it glowed in the dark."
5,Saved my life.,"This shirt saved my life when a tornado threw a semi-trailer truck at my small Ford Ranger on the interstate. Both I and my Three Wolf Moon shirt walked away without a scratch, and my truck sustained minimal damage (a busted tail light). Take that, tornadoes!"
4,Just Orodered My Three Wolf,"I ordered this, along w/ a velvet painting of Elvis, but how come you don't have ""Look Inside"" capability like you do for books?"
4,But my baby turned out brown.,"I bought this shirt and it worked. I got a super hot wife. However, I am only giving it 4 stars because my baby turned out brown."
1,Shut your faces,"This is so stupid and all of you are immature. Writing about how you all like some stupid T-shirt from the 80s. First off, none of you know anything about Wolves, or moons, or tshirts, or wolf moon tshirt fashion. This wolf shirt isn't even that good. The lowest wolf isnt howling in the same direction as the others. DO YOU GUYS KNOW NOTHING? LOL, No self respecting woodsman would ever like this shirt, let alone support the people who killed the wolves so they could be on it. The newest shirts have real wolf hair on it and painted blood stains to make it gritty and on the edge. Yea, this wolf shirts okay...for my little sister. I wouldnt wear this shirt for 50,000,000 dollars. Let me ask you this, where are the fangs? If I saw you on the street with it on, i'd probably punch you in the face and show you what a real wolf shirt looks like."
5,This is a shirt for a god!,"I love this shirt; I just can't get enough of it. Why, after putting on my three-wolf-moon T-shirt, I suddenly got the urge to run on all fours, howl at the moon, and kill and eat a deer using nothing but my teeth.Unfortunately, this all happened at the city zoo in front of kids during School Day. I tried to explain to the police that it was because of the shirt, but for some reason, they're not buying it."
5,Must have for He-Man enthusiasts,"Grayskull is an impressive playset, both for displayability for collectors and for functionality for kids to play with.Well built and durable, with loads of fun features for kids to play with. It will detect figures as they approach, and react accordingly and differently if He-Man or Skeletor approach its front gate.If you're not sure get it on sale, but if you or your kids love He-Man it's worth the purchase."
1,"Chobits, Vol. 2",Parents: This is porno; not a comic book. Do not let your children order it. It states on the cover that it is suitable for older teens 16 +.
4,Porter Cable 3700 Laser Miter Saw,I purchase this item some time ago. Worked great for a couple of years. I started having laser problems then the laser went out. I replaced the laser switch and it is as good as new. I beleive the replacement switch is available from Porter Cable/Dewalt at least it is listed on their web site. Cost is around $5.00. I purchased one from Mouser Electronics P/N 611-D105J12S205QA. Switch is easily removed with a screwdriver and the wires are plug in type. Hope this helps someone.Lenny
4,Terrific.,"The story of a troubled younger younger sister of a successful singer, who is driven to make it in the music business herself. I'm dumbfounded by the reviewers who didn't care for Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance; I thought it was stunning. On the other hand, I found Mare Winningham thoroughly dull -- she hardly moves a facial muscle in the entire movie, and isn't much of a singer for a supposedly wildly popular star. I also question those who refer to Leigh's character as lacking talent; Leigh's performance of the Van Morrison tune ""Take Me Back"" is riveting, goosebump stuff. I saw this as a story, not of a talentless younger sister, but one who -- as her brother-in-law puts it -- is an original, without malice, while her sister is neither. The only slow parts of the film are some of the unnecessesarily drawn-out musical numbers; since Winningham can barely sing, why give us four full minutes watching her do nothing but stand on a stage and sing poorly?Strongly recommended."
4,pretty damn good,"usually i am not really into this type of music. but i was blown away by sexual (li da di), very seductive and sexy."
3,"Good, but","I got this book expecting it to be full of WH40K artwork, but most graphics are pictures that have been digitally altered such as taking a picture of a planet and throwing some blurry outlines of starships in it. Lack of clarity is attributed to warp distortion. I know they probably did this to add a sense of realism, but I thought it made a poor product. If the picture says it is a White Scars Astartes then you shouldn't have to stare at a blurry image trying to figure out if the caption is a typo.The maps are so basic they are pointless.The few illustrations are very nice, and the text is very good and informative. However, I didn't think this book was worth the price."
4,Hit and miss.,"Moment of Truth is not her best album but still some really good tracks. For a Suzy fan, it's certainly worth the buy."
2,My first Maze CD - a disappointment,"10 tracks can hardly do justice to Maze and since 2 of them are remixes, you are left with 8 Greatest Hits. The only reason I've held onto it after replacing it withGreatest Hitsis the latter does not have the album version of Joy And Pain (it is replaced by a live version as is Happy Feelin's). OtherwiseGreatest Hitsis a much better selection for your money with 10 more songs for a couple more dollars."
5,pleased,"The watch is the one that I was looking for. I like the size, the look and it has some numbers on the face instead of all dots for the time."
2,So Boring,I have to say I was bored to tears. I didn't even finish the book. It just seemed to me that the same concepts and views could have been said in half the pages.
4,Great book for teaching young women,"""Gentlemen's Club"" by Becky Due is a coming of age story about a woman who figures out what is important to her, despite very difficult situations. As she lives she meets other women who have also had a tough life and have managed to turn themselves around. I found this book uplifting to the struggles women face and would recommend it."
1,don't waste your money,"I had heard many good things about this album from several people. Normally I'm not one to go out and buy an album based on recomendations and without personally listening to it, but this one time, I did. I didn't like it. Ok, I'll be fair, there are 2 songs that have some good points (good meaning-- they don't hurt my ears). In those songs, I can tell that the lead singer possibly DOES know how to sing, but for some reason tries to sound waaaay too whiney and off-tune on every other note. Why? 'Cause it's emo? Stylish? I don't know. If you reallyreally have to try them out, at least buy the CD used and burn the two somewhat decent songs before selling it to an unknowing friend. Then use that money to buy Clarity or anything Sunny Day. Or even Mineral or Eureka Farm. I promise these groups won't leave you so disappointed."
3,It's Alright,"I bought a used copy of this book. It was very used, but you get what you pay for. #Fish"
3,good read,i wanted to read something by Sinclair. this book was at a good price. i was a good fast easy read.
1,It does not work for the A920,"I bought this item for my A920 but it does not fit. The description states the A920 that is why I bought it but the adapter does not fit. Total loss of money, becuse sending it back costs as much as the item."
1,wrong item,The description said how it works with all these different samsung models but did not fit mine at all as I took a chance as I didn't see my model sph-m930 listed and I did not get re-imbursed either. I called Amazon before ordering another one and hopefully this will work.
1,Run like the wind,"Seldom have I been as unimpressed as I have with this scope. Though I bought it for shooting, just last night, comparing it against a Celestron 15X70 pair of binoculars, they left this scope in the dirt.If you can find a little more money, do not buy this scope!"
3,Caution!,"My 2 sons had beeb eyeing this School Bus for their new pet hamster and we finally purchased it, but I was quite displeased to see that the Water bottles little metal cap doesnt stay on...it is very flimsy and I hope our Teddy Boy..doesnt figure how to just push the waterbottle up and escape thru that whole! It is cute..but could have been made a bit better w/ a screw on cap!"
4,"If you must have and REM record, get this one!","This is good stuff. I was never a huge REM fan but I did like them because back in the day there were pretty cool. They had a cool stripped down sound that was unconventional at the time. What that means is they did not exactly rock my socks off but they were playing actual guitars, drums and basses instead of a synthesizer and drum machine. In my mind that was enough to make them pretty cool. My sister had Reckoning (also pretty cool) and Fables of the Reconstruction (which sucked) so when Lifes Rich Pageant came out I was pretty familiar with REM and kind of liked some of their stuff but felt funny about it because they were my sisters band. The video for Fall on Me is what sold me on the record and I am glad it did because this (as I have said) is good stuff. Buck's guitar had some snarl to it and the drums are heavy and driving - much more so than before or since. As I have admitted, I am not a huge REM fan but have never stopped liking this album."
3,It wears off after a while,"I really liked this album the first few times I heard it, but it does not reward repeated listening. After I had had it for a few months, I had pretty much heard it. It still doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't end up in my player very often. I suppose this style of music is not for me."
5,Gradually became greater for me,"I really liked this album right away upon hearing it but, more than any other album I can think of, it has grown greater and greater over time for me. It has an integrity that reveals itself over repeated listenings. ""Superman"" is the greatest hidden track ever, ""Cuyahoga"" still leaves me speechless, and there's not one weak track on the whole thing."
5,Excellent CD,This disc is the summation of the works done by REM through the years. It contains songs that reflect their early years and songs that prelude their later works. it is a must for any REM fan and a good addition to anyone's cd collection
2,Routine Spaghetti Western.,"Routine Spaghetti Western.Roger Ebert's 1969 review includes this canny observation: ""Van Cleef's face, in closeup, has the lean, hardened, embittered expression of a man who has either (a) been pursuing his lonely vengeance across the plains of the West for 30 years, or (b) realizes he will be making spaghetti Westerns the rest of his life."""
4,Good Bye Sportatorium.,"I remember staying up late on saturday nights in junior high/ high school to catch World Class wrestling on Channel 17 in Philadelphia 82-85. What a great promotion. This docu captures all the inside action of the WCCW promotion and also it's downfall in the late 80's. It was sad to see the Sportatorium in the condition it was left. True wrestling fans will be impressed. It's kind of low budget, but done well. Gary Hart and Bill Mercer do a great job of explaining the behind the scenes action."
1,"unimaginative, boring, not at all worth the money","This has to be one of the worst rip offs that I have come accross in a while. $30 for a book with no imagination, and no creative ideas is ridiculous. Save your money, you are better off looking to the internet for free."
4,Great Fun!,Very funny DVD. If you are a Sean Connery fan then you HAVE to see this. HIs bit on being Scottish is hysterical. Plus the fact that he had just become a US citizen is very cool.
4,"Love Craig, But He's Funnier With Geoff Peterson & A Censor","The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson is our fave TV show. Craig is hilariously irreverent and the funniest guy on late night by far. Just listen to the audience; Craig gets actual LAUGHS while the other guys predominantly get applause; like a pat on the head for being clever. Having said that, this DVD was nowhere near as funny as Craig's late night show. He needs Geoff; they complement each other like the new Laurel & Hardy, but funnier and contemporary and irreverent. This DVD was surprisingly lacking teeth. It's almost as if Craig needs a censor so he knows exactly how hard to ride the line. Still a fan, but his TV show is just better."
5,A minor miracle,"Michael Harris' The Chieu Hoi Saloon is one of the most harrowing depictions of a character in crisis that I've ever read. Denis Lehane once described noir as working class tragedy, where the characters ""don't fall from great heights, they fall from the curb."" Harry Hudson, The Chieu Hoi Saloon`s protagonist, falls from curb to gutter to sewer, and somehow manages to keep falling. The stakes are small, there are no hamhanded plot points, there's just this one broken and heartbreaking character doing the best he can to play with the hand he's been dealt. It's a minor miracle he even manages to survive the hell of his day-to-day existence; that he does so with a kind of grace and courage is evidence of how wonderful a writer Harris is."
3,Basic information,"This book is short but entertaining. The information is helpful for any lawyer wanting education about managing a firm, but is geared more towards big firm attorneys."
1,the problam...,"The problem with this album, and the one before it is that this is not the same B&S; that gave us such gems as ""dog on wheels"" & ""Slow Graffiti"". Over the years they've lost two band members, and it deffinetly shows. No matter how hard she tries, Sarah just can't take the place of Isobel.All the albums before Dear Catastrophe Waitress had that same producer which is why they all follow the same theme, a theme that their fans have grown fond of. After Isobel left and they changed to Rough Trade they lost their interesting side and became ""croud pleasing"". You cant really falt a band for wanting to reach an larger audiance (and therefore make more money) but you can fault them for being a poor pastiche of hits from the 70's."
4,A Near-Flawless Collection Of Pop,"""The Life Pursuit"" is the newest and, arguably, best album in the Belle and Sebastian collection. From the very beginning to the very end, the group's near-flawless pop songs will have you dancing, singing, humming, and just having a good time. This is what pop music is all about! There are a few low points in the album, but they are overshadowed by the sunny pop songs that fill this album. Standout tracks include: ""White Collar Boy"" ""Sukie in the graveyard"" and ""We are the sleepyheads.""If you're a B&S; fan, don't miss out on this opportunity. You will not be disappointed in this album. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Also recommended for fans of: Of Montreal, The New Pornographers, and ....The Grass Roots."
5,Ideal for Intermediate-level students,"I lived in Italy for two years as a college student and once spoke the language fairly well. When I needed a refresher years later I found that few of the available books or tapes were suited for my experience level -- and they were all pretty dull. This set was exactly what I needed. The lengthy dialogues involve real people and reflect how Italian is actually spoken in that country. The discussions of grammar are very useful, both reinforcing the essentials and encouraging one to develop genuine conversational skills (useful if you actually hope to socialize overseas). I find myself listening to the tapes often -- highly recommended!"
5,A GREAT PLACE TO START IF YOU'RE A NEW R.E.M. FAN,"THIS 12 TRACK GREATEST HITS COLLECTION IS A VERY GOOD BUY REALLY FOR ANY R.E.M. FAN, OLD OR NEW. THIS CD HAS ALL OF THEIR BEST 80S SONGS LIKE, ''CANT GET THERE FROM HERE'', ''RADIO FREE EUROPE'', ''DRIVER 8'', AND MY FAVORITE, ''ITS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT AND I FEEL FINE''. THIS IS THE BEST R.E.M. GREATEST HITS COLLECTION YOU CAN FIND. FOR A REAL GOOD ANTHOLOGY OF THE BAND, GET THIS AND THE NEWEST GREATEST HITS CD FROM R.E.M., ENTITLED ''IN TIME; THE BEST OF R.E.M. 1988-2003''."
3,Good live Cocker,"Well, in short...good sound, good vocal performances from Joe Cocker, several good songs (and a few really forgettable ones as well). All good, but not great, unfortunately.The arrangements seem a little over-blown at times, robbing the music of its R&B-grit, but that is a minor complaint.""Joe Cocker Live"" is a good live album. It just doesn't feel all that necessary, mainly because these extremely conservative live renditions of songs like ""Shelter Me"", ""Unchain My Heart"" and ""When The Night Comes"" are barely distinguishable from the originals, adding nothing whatsoever to the studio cuts.A little more recklessness would have been nice."
3,Bass Popping Sound,"I bought these speakers based on reviews on this site and the cost. They sound good on some songs, but on others there is a popping sound that comes from the hole in the subwoofer. I would hope this is some kind of flaw but customer service has not been much help. On those songs I have to turn the bass down to almost 0 or be annoyed by the sound."
2,Where's the Middle?,"Pros: These speakers look cool. The volume control unit is very convenient.Cons: You can only control the bass. On many songs you hear too much bass (sounds like someone blowing in a jug at times) OR the tweeters. Mid range is missing. If I had tried these in the store before buying I probably would have bought something else. Not a great sound at $50. My Boston BA265 speakers, for example, had a much more even, rich sound at half the cost. I'll probably sell mine and splurge on the Klipsch 2.1s. Maybe if your playing device has an equilizer you could smooth it out. Some people like this sound setting; I just don't."
5,Great for the Price,"I hooked these up last night, and was BLOWN away by how good they sounded. I have a 'high end' brand in the home theater and they are not up to that, but for the computer they are amazing. Even my 8 year old was blown away by her first song played on them ""Dad it's like being at the concert!"". For the $29 they currently are running with the rebate, you should get them. Particularly if you are still using speakers that came with the computer. If you listen to stuff on the computer at all, you won't be sorry."
4,A Great Picture Book of Andalusia,"Perhaps one of the most beautiful regions in the world, Andalusia is a landscape filled with color and majesty. Evergreen's book captures the magnificence of southern Spain with its gorgeous photography and charming prose. If you love travel, Spain, or exotic places, this book is for you. Chapters cover major cities (Seville, Malaga, Granada, and more) and major regions, as well as popular customs and old traditions. This book is a great introduction to Andalusia; it is by no means an in-depth historical account or a travel guide. Primarily a picture book, this volume is easy to read and meant to be enjoyed at leisure. If anything, this book is too slim and leaves you wanting more."
4,learn to read music,"I took piano lessons many, many years ago and want to start them again. This little book helped refresh my memory and I'm ready to get started learning to play the piano again."
3,Just ok......,"This book was not easy to navigate, making its use as a reference book less than ideal.There are better books on the market for this subject."
4,"New Item, Worth The Investment","I was looking for a portable jar of pads/wipes to refresh my face. The witch hazel pads work, cutting oiliness and getting grime off my face. I will purchase these again! Reapply sunscreen if you're doing outdoorsy stuff, though."
5,Does a good job,"I like to keep a jar of witch hazel pads in my desk... I have oily skin and they do a great job of freshening me up after a long day or if I work very late. THey're also great for long trips in between showers.I used to get ""Dickinson's"" but it seems they no longer make pads. These are rather larger -- too large for the use I need, really -- but they get the job done. The jar is fine for the desk drawer but too big to stuff in your carry-on for long or overseas flights.Stil, you can go from feeling ""soiled"" to fresh and tight-skinned in 30 sec without leaving your desk. Pretty good deal."
1,A waste of time,"This book is a horrible waste of time. Oh my gosh, the minimum wage taco maker put 2.5 oz of cheese on my taco instead of three. Well, I think that I will march to wall street and burst into the CEOs office and get him to give me a new taco. If you want to learn how to become a complete jerk, please read this book, as it is an excellent guide. If you want real customer service, try Clark Howard's book."
3,no subtitles,a few english words are in there to try and help but if had not seen the other 2 versions i would have been unable to follow
5,His Best Album By Far - Terrific!,This is a great live album. By far Jimi's best album - all you need is this and a best of collection. One of the best live albums ever.
3,"Music is great, but pressing????","I have so far purchased 2 vinyl pressings (the red one) by Capitol and the first one had blatant sctatches on it.The second one: Side 1 is fine, but side two (played on a very good turntable with new cartridge) sounds horrible! So much snap, crackle, pop yet no marks. Who does Capitol think they are fooling? I paid $17 for this record, and even though Hendrix is great on vinyl, I now prefer to listen to my used CD of ""The band of gypsies"" that I bought for three dollars!Please, if you purchase this version, listen carefully, and if it sucks as my two copies did, return it and post something similar to this. Don't let this Mega corporation get away with cheating, and skimping out on vinyl quality!Peter Lorenz ArtleRecord collector and musicologist"
4,Prophetic Funk Rock,"This album hints at a new direction for Hendrix with a more R&B inflected sound(harking back to his roots). While its certainly not his best and i wouldn't term at it as great(for a Hendrix album), it contains 2 absolute masterpieces in ""Machine Gun"" and ""Who Knows""; the latter paving the way for 70's funk rock- via Funkadelic and the other lesser lights."
4,All in one place.,"Nice to finally have the first 2 albums from this overlooked band (with extra tracks!!) out in cd format. Good, quality versions of both. Was always a fan, and thought they should have been bigger than they were.Love the live cd, as it includes previously unreleased material on it as well. Always like to hear how bands do things live, and this is a quality recording.Only minor quibble would be that I wish the live dvd was just the performance, and didn't include the silly ""dream"" sequences of each band member. If they ever just put out the live dvd straight up, I'd buy it. Just want to see the guys rock!"
3,Nice try but...,"I happen to be a fan of Latifah, and have admired her singing in the filmed musicals ""Chicago"" and ""Hairspray"". However, I was disappointed in her take on this material. Her somewhat dry vibrato-challenged voice is not well suited to this repetoire. And, like most pop singers attempting jazz-inflected arrangements, she repeats every chorus more or less the same way, not a very interesting or jazz-like approach. I hope she can grow into this, and find a bit of vibrato along the way."
5,Trav'lin Light,"I loved this CD. It was even better than ""The Dana Owens Album"". I especially loved her version of ""Don't Cry Baby"", ""I Want a Little Sugar In My Bowl"" and ""How Long"". Her voice is more polished than on the previous CD and I thought the song selections were great also."
5,Queen Latifah,"Trav'lin' LightI believe Dana Owens, Queen Latifah has a future in jazz. She certainly has the voice and attitude for singing it. I believe the original songsters of the songs on her album would have been proud. Wonderful CD, mellow, light and easy listening. Hope to hear more jazz from her in the future."
4,Mission From Rap to Smooth Pop Accomplished (3.5 stars),"Now it can be told: Queen Latifah has traveled from being a provocative rap/hip-hop pioneer to a conventional, silky-smooth singer of traditional pop and standards (I Love Being Here With You, I'm Not In Love). Her voice is a curious distillation of DIANA KRALL and GLORIA ESTEFAN and the musical personality (already hinted at the ""Chicago"" movie) feels home at the easy listening pastures. For now, it does not seem to go away soon. If you seek a CD full of sun for this winter, this may be it."
3,Pet Shop Boys-Behavior,"""Being Boring"" is an amazing song but the rest is pretty average. I just got ""Release"" and it is average also. If you want to experience good PSB, stick to their last two releases. ""Yes"" and ""Fundamental."" They took a huge leap forward in song writing and production with those two CD's."
2,Being boring indeed,"The lead track, ""Being Boring,"" has engendered affection over the years, but it is unmistakably ironic that a song with that title leads off an album of mostly plodding, sleepy, electro-elevator music. Most of the songs are boring. You'd have to be a hardcore PSB fan to find this a good album. For everyone else, this is the single for ""Being Boring"" and ""How Can You,"" and all the rest are B-sides."
3,Not What I Expected,"I read this book because my sister went through horrible PPD. She even ended up hospitalized. Unlike Brooke my sister did not have the huge amount of financial resources to obtain help or to hire a nanny. I was a bit disappointed with this book because it was all about Brooke Brooke Brooke. I got the sence that she felt she owned pain. I do not blame her too much I guess because when you're rich and famous and treated like royalty your whole life, it's hard to relate to how the everyday person lives. In fact I think Brooke is a very nice person despite her lifelong fame based on her incredible beauty. So I'm not saying anything bad about Brooke Shields herself, I'm just commenting on the fact that her book is not a help book for women suffering PPD. It's just another book about Brooke Shields."
3,Down Came the Rain,I bought this for my wife who has not read it yet. It came on time and in new condition. I was pleased with the seller
4,I almost felt as though she was speaking right to me,"I thought this book was wonderful in it's description of how Ms. Shields felt. Her struggle to get pregnant was heart-wrenching, and once the baby came and she described how disconnected she felt, I was crying. I couldn't read the book while anyone was even around, because I knew my husband would be asking me what was wrong. Although I didn't feel *quite* the same things as Ms. Shields, many of the emotions and thoughts she described were eerily familiar. I was glad she also gave a list of websites and resources, and I have checked a few of them out. Post partum depression can be absolutely devastating, and I'm glad she wrote this book to share her story so that others don't have to feel so alone."
2,Boring,"I couldn't even finish this book. Terribly written and did not hold my interest in the slightest. Read ""It Sucked and then I cried"" by Heather Armstrong for a ""real"" look at postpartum depression."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"This mailbox is not secure at all. A few weeks ago, someone used a screwdriver to remove bothdoors. Instead of a metal hing holding the door's on, there are tiny button's that stick out of each side of the door's acting as a hunge. It needs inprovement on it's design."
4,"Great Book, interesting subject of human evolution.","A very good book of short stories written by the master of sciencefiction. The main topic of the book is human development,and how we might have come to being, and where we aregoing as a evolutionary specimen. Written as a greatgroup of ""what if"" stories, Heinlein gives us a picture ofhow great our society can be."
5,Meet Tennessee Williams!,"This is the best way to meet T.Williams and his works. Better than a Biography, it combines live interviews with TW along with clips from his most important plays. In just 80 minutes, you will understand TW and his genius without having to read or watch movies. 10 times better than Cliff Notes...99% more entertaining than most documentaries.HIGHLY RECCOMMEND.-Bob Monement, Sylvan Lake, MI"
3,Good sequel...,"This is about as good a sequel as one could hope for. Remember, at the end of The Howling (the book, not the movie) the town of Drago was destroyed by fire. Some of the wolves escaped. The plot picks up three years later. Karyn and Chris are no longer together and she has remarried. Roy and Marcia however, are still together and Marcia wants revenge. The silver bullet fired into her head has deprived her of the ability to change into a full-on werewolf, so she makes Roy do her bidding. This is a weakness of the story - Roy comes across as a weak character who is thoroughly ""whipped"", even though he is the principle werewolf.The lycanthropic couple pursue Karyn from Seattle to LA to Mexico, where the final confrontation finally takes place. As with the first book, it is tightly plotted and a fast read. I enjoyed the climax of the story - the werewolf attacks in Mazatlan. All in all, it is a good sequel."

4,QUALITY CD HERE,"THIS CD IS QUALITY, IF YOU LIKE VINTAGE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS! TRACK 1 AND 11 ARE MY FAVORITES, AND OF COURSE UNDER THE BRIDGE IS A FANTASTIC SONG!"
4,Elfstones Worth the Read,"Better than ""The Sword of Shannara"", which was a good book until the unsatisfying finish. The ""Elfstones"" holds your interest throughout and did have an ending that was worth the buildup."
5,BEST BOOK YET!,I am a big Terry brooks fan. I love his style of writing and his character development. many people say that Terry Brooks is a copy of Tolkien. Which I think is absolutly not true. If someone compares like that they obviously have no idea what they are talking about.Elfstones of Shannara I think Is my favorite book he has written and one of my favorite books of all time. I thought it was absolutly wonderful!When Amberle does the transformation I cried.I have never cried over a book before but I wept like a baby. I would read this book again and again..........and again! ^_^
5,A very gripping book.,"I picked this book in a small place in OC, MD, that sells used books, and when I brought it home, I read the first ten pages and was hooked. It's the first book I've read by Brooks, and I can't wait to buy more. It was creepy, terrifying, tragic, and noble before it was done. The defeat of the demons had consequences, and the characters had (surprise!) complex motives and hidden fears. I recommend for fans of high fantasy."
4,Very Entertaining,"Personally, I wanted a different ending, but the book was a good read. I didn't read the others in the series but I am curious now about what they are like. The story ended with some of the plots left open, since they want you to buy the next in the series, but it doesn't detract from the story. Everything was well explained, as far as cultures and past happenings, and the characters were well written and easily identified. I thought it was great."
2,Disappointing,"I choked on the verbiage. Yakity, yakity, yakity yak. I tossed it in the garbage, after reading sixty or so pages. And this was a Bestseller? Obviously, a lot more people are tolerant of insipid, diluted stories than I am."
5,Ancient History,"This book indulges itself in the ancient past of the Four Lands, from faerie creatures to their ultimate enemies who just happen hate the elves more then a sane creature could hate. These enemies of Good itself are scratching through the thin walls that stop them from returning to the Four Lands. And they are beginning to break free...This book is an epic which can stand proudly by (if not slightly behind) the Sword of Shannara (as I believe it is absolutely the best). This book is full of stuff only spoken of in myths and legends- trully a treat to read. It is a book of sacrifice and of hard-earned love."
4,This is his best book,"This book is MANY, MANY times better than the ""Sword of Shannara"". The characters of Wil and Amberle and their adventures were the thing that cause me to love this book even though i didn't like the first book of the series."
1,Rating on shipment of product,The only complaint I have is that the belt that shipped was the wrong color. It was a dark royal blue and I had ordered the Columbia blue. It was labeled Columbia blue but that's not what was in the package.
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I produced a medium-size web site based on the manual that came with Front Page 2000. This book doesn't go much further than the manual. Even at that, it left me scratching my head due to lack of further explanation as to why I was told to do certain things. Very frustrating. Some explanations as to how to do something take you down the LONG road when a click of the right mouse button would have you there much sooner. If you're looking for a book that really gets under the hood of Front Page 2000, look elsewhere!"
3,"Good Info, Bad Writting","I will keep this short because you can read more in depth with the other reviews.I loved the subject matter, this is the only place you will find the complete history of cheating in Nascar.I did not like the writing style. Most of the book is quotes from Nascar drivers, owners, and engineers (who are not the most well-versed people) and the authors opinions. It was also really dumbed down for the target audience, with very little technical information. Most of it was: ""The team did X to make the car turn better."" Being an engineer by trade, I found myself often thinking, ""Well how does that actually work?"" and left wondering.Overall, I think most Nascar fans will enjoy it, but I can't really recommend it if you want more technical information on the cars."
4,Eddy Grant's most stylistically diverse album.,"""Love In Exile"" is a very diverse album on which Eddy Grant explores and takes on various musical genres--with varying degrees of success. The disco-flavored ""My Turn To Love You"" and the mellow stepper ""Feel The Rhythm Of You And I""could have been major R&B hits while the roots-reggae number ""Exiled (From The Love I Know)"" is one of Grant's most dramatic performances. While not a commercial success, ""Love In Exile"" remains an underrated classic."
4,All in all definitely worth adding to your reggae collection,"Antother good old reggae-pop album from Eddy Grant. Like all his albums it has it's own distinct flavour. Lots of love and romance like the energetic-samba sounding My Turn to Love You , the high energy funky Nobody's Got Time and the melodic Feel the Rhythm of You and I. Then there is the hopeful Exiled from the Love I Know and the overtly political Preachin' Genocide.All in all definitely worth adding to your reggae collection."
5,"Very Insightful, A Must Read For Pre-School Teachers","I am really taking my time reading this book. There is so much good information that even though I have been in the classroom for 10 years, I am still learning new information. Thank you so much!"
4,I was moved by the performances.,"The movie captures the experiences of the aftermath with the horrors left from HOLOCAUST relived by ALL the survivors. I strongly recommend this movie as a stepping stone to further debates on prejudice and racism . An interesting discussion and collection piece for teachers and other role models. I plan to purchase this movie (when the rate lowers) to show my children, nieces/nephews, and grand-children. Please review this movie with a teenager. (The rating was given a four due to the fact there was little storyline with the parental issues. It would have been interesting to know how Daisy's mother/father reacted/felt about issues.)"
2,"Too many complex issues raised, but none solved/resolved","This is a nice, warm film about a teenage girl, who seems to have many problems, in addition to the usual teenage stuff. The film's flaw is that it raises loads of exceptionally complex issues (first love, peer pressure, parental neglect, dark family history, dysfuntion in modern familes, etc.), trying to resolve them all at once. As a result, it resolves none of those issues. It leaves its viewers wondering about whether they should take this film as a heart-warming teenage melodrama, pshychosoial study of teenagers or holocaust drama. So, the film loses its enertaiment value, while viewers are looking for the answer(s). And good feature films can't afford to do that, no matter how serious and deep their subject matter is."
4,Rock Medicine Works,I have used the techniques in this book for many years and have always found them to successfully bring about positive results.Absolutely love what Sela is sharing!
5,Spiritually Uplifting,"I enjoyed reading Sela Weidemann Randazzo's book. I feel that it not only gives remedies for various ailments, it gives hope and optimism for the future itself. It doesn't matter what religion you are. This book carries a universal message of love and of healing. I only hope that Sela will continue to write and share her knowledge with us."
2,China....,"This thing sucks. it's not worth $9.99, I bet they're actually making a profit of $0.90. I bought it for my tv to hook it up to my speaker system and the contact that sticks out(don't know what it's called) broke off on the white one. Very poor quality."
5,Works just like it should!,I got this splitter cable for a TV in my apartment so that I could hook up computer speakers. It works just like I thought it would so it gets 5 stars in my book!
5,Simply works,It is a simple device and it serves its purpose. I combine this with a GoGroove Bluetooth Transmitter and Bluetooth headset so I can watch TV in bed without disturbing the wife. I can turn the volume as low as it goes on the TV (Not all the way off) and plug this with the BT adapter into the TV and hear it just fine over the BT headset.
1,Didnt work,"Plugged it into iPod Touch and pressed play. It didnt work. No sound came. Worked with other real AUX cord i had, so its not like the speakers were muted or anything"
5,Great Product and Fast Delivery,"The price for this adapter was much cheaper than in local stores, it functions perfectly, and arrived sooner than expected. The next time I need something, I will first check-out AMAMAX! No, I am not an employee or owner, just a happy customer!"
5,"Excellent product, especially for the price","I bought this adapter so I could hook up aftermarket computer speakers to the lacking speakers on my flat screen TV. I received it just as promised, and for a great price. Beats any other retail price out there. Thanks"
3,Awsome product,"No doubts about its quality, however it would be nice if the shank on the 3mm connector end were longer, threaded, and came with a nut so mounting it professionally would be easier..and all of the above mentioned changes were in black to accomidate new sports cars interioirs"
1,Are these supposed to be stereo?,"I bought 3 of these to connect the analog outputs of my Samsung Blu-ray player to my Logitech 5.1 computer speaker system. The physical connection felt ok, but when I ran the speaker test, things were not ok. Only one of the front speakers got a signal, while both surround speakers got a signal at the same time. I switched the cables around every which way, and got nothing but improper sound output to the various speakers and subwoofer.I then found some better quality cables of the same type that stated ""stereo"" on the package at a local store for $3.89 each, just slightly more than I paid for these after shipping. After swapping them in I ran the speaker test on the Samsung player again, and got correct sound out of all 5 speakers and the subwoofer.Since I got these cables for$.62 each plus $2.99 non-refundable shipping each, they weren't worth returning.Bottom Line: ***tty cables"
1,Wrong Purchase,"This cable was the recommended product by Amazon stating, people that bought the bluetooth adapter also looked at the 2 x RCA cable. The bluetooth adapter comes with its own 2xRCA cable plus the cable does not fit the bluetooth adapter."
1,Cheap cable don't buy it,This is a cheap cable with that broke after hardly any use. I would suggest looking for something else by a different manufacture.
5,I CAN HEAR MY TV!,"Thanks to amazon I have these plugs that lets me hear my TV no matter how loud it gets here. Now all I need is to find a wireless headphones, I move around alot in my too small room and so I get all tangled up in my cord. Thanks for my plug."
5,great prices.,"this store has all my needs,im not kidding,i bought alot of stuff from this place,and would'nt go any where else for these prices i'll stay right here."
1,DOA,The cables did not work. The cover over one of the RCA jacks pulled off when I pulled it out of the jack. These were cheap but the when the connector came off I could tell the cables were already frayed.
5,Good wire to have,"I was impressed with the price and it shipped quickly, It showed up in great shape, and it is in better condition than I expected. works quite well, I will definitely Do business with this place again."
1,i have not received it yet,"i have not received it yet since i placed the order two months ago. One month ago, they promised to ship another one, but up till now , i still have not received it. i will update my review if i receive it later."
1,Is the author too intelligent?,"This book was one of the textbooks for an honors leadership course I took in college. I absolutely hated it. The concepts were interesting but the language was too hard to follow. I felt inferior as I was reading this book, which is not aomething an author should strive to achieve.Although, as I stated above, the author had interesting ideas and concepts, there was one thing that I had a tough time swallowing. The author argues that there is no such thing as a ""bad leader"". Instead, if you are not a good leader, you are not a leader. I strongly disagree with this idea, as an individual can be a leader but not a good one. I'm sure that most people can think of someone in their life that they would categorize as a ""bad leader"".I will never recommend this book, nor will I ever purchase or read another book written by this author."
5,Great Harmonies,"This album has some of the best songs and harmonies of the 1990's. ""Hold On"", ""Release Me"", ""Impulsive"", ""You're In Love"", ""The Dream Is Still Alive"" are all terrific songs with unbeatable harmonies. This group should have went on to become the ""new"" Supremes but unfortunately their next album bombed and they broke up and went their seperate ways creating lack-luster music. I highly recommend this CD to anybody wanting to hear great pop music."
3,see don't touch,"I'm a fan of Mazinger since I saw the original series back in the 80s translated in Spanish. It was awesome to see this valiant machine powered by Koji Kabuto take damage from so many battles and keep going. Of course it was later replaced by Great Mazinger and further by the ultimate reincarnation Mazinkaiser. It could never replace the original in my heart but I couldn't resist owning it.So here I am a few dollars short anticipating its arrival. Revoltech sounds like this awesome new way to pose figures. The pictures show 'kaiser in these awesome poses. Now it's here. The detail is amazing. The extra arts are awesome. The arm... is stuck. I try to loosen it an d it cracks. I drop the sword and it breaks. I glue it together and finally acquire some poses. But it's not the experience Revoltech promised. The bending of joints is hard. The toy is so small that you just know the box is where it belongs, not in your hands. So much for the ultimate machine."
1,"Terrible, terrible Music","All four ex-Beatles produced some pretty great music and some pretty awful music on their own. Paul's bad music was lightweight and boring; George's was preachy and overbearing; and Ringo's was just not memorable in any way. But the worst of the bad music belonged to John because it was so superior, arrogant and preachy. And this album is the worst of the lot. John should have had the judgment to tell Yoko to get out of the control room when the Beatles were recording ""Let it Be"" and to get off the stage after they broke up. It's not that she had no talent (""Hard Times Are Over"" from ""Double Fantasy"" is actually quite good), but she didn't have much and none of it is on display here. A dismal and embarassing effort."
3,"""Some Time"" heals old wounds","Unlike the scathing reception it recieved way back in 1972, SINYC doesn't seem as bad as many tag it to be. Granted some of the subject may be dated,but in the end it's the music that wins you over, as well, a new experience when you've been spoiled by the essentials (JL/POB,Imagine,W&B; etc),and probably a better listening experience than the mediocre(side 2 of Mind Games).Songs like ""Luck of the Irish"",""John Sinclair"",New York City,and even ""Woman is the ____ of The World hold up just as well as many of his greatest songs.Of Yoko Ono's songs on STINYC,""Sisters,O Sisters"" has a cute girl group appeal(unlike the horrendous rendition from the Madison Square Garden show) In closing if you'd like to discover a different facet of Lennon's music STINYC may not be his best, but it's far from the worst."
4,Unfairly maligned,"This album has an absolutely awful reputation, but if you actually give it a listen, there's some really cool stuff happening here. Lyrically, the album is a bit of a mess; the overly political messages grossly simplify complex situations (is the answer to the Attica State shootings really to release ALL prisoners everywhere???), but musically, it's really quite cool. ""Woman is the N***** of the World"" is a really great song, largely overlooked due to its title. Yoko has a very large presence on the album, which initially turned me off. However, the second listen allowed me to actually listen to what she was doing here, and a lot of it is really cool and actually quite influential.Although the album's style is a major clash with Lennon's prior album, ""Imagine,"" it's definitely worth a shot. You may have to give it a few listens to get a feel for it, but it's totally worth it. The live portion of the album, however, is quite awful."
1,"Stale, smells mostly of alcohol","Not a good purchase. I was so disappointed with this purchase. It smells mostly of alcohol, sort of like an old perfume. Too bad."
5,Love this product,I've used this product for years--now I can pay less than 1/2 price for buying it online! Definitely recommend if you like a light floral perfume that isn't overpowering.
5,A Favorite That Is Yet To Be Matched,"My wife loved this scent the first time she sprayed the testor many years ago. It's still her favorite and mine too. We hope it will never be discontinued. Try it, you'll love it too."
3,Nice but different,"I have loved Jessica for several years and I thought I would give it a whirl on Amazon for the great price.The perfume I recieved smells nice but a bit chemicalish, almost overwhelmingly so at first.Will most def pick Jessica up at the beauty counter next time."
2,Not the Real Thing,"I purchased Jessica McClintock perfume spray from Amazon's affiliate FragranceGo. The packaging looked like genuine Jessica McClintock, but the scent was much weaker than the department store version. Based on this, and years of using Jessica, my wife is convinced that this is not the genuine article. I will not purchase from FragranceGo again."
3,Best of Van Morrison,"Only one song on this album was scratched to the point of not being able to play without skipping, but this is by far my favorite Van Morrison album, and it was a replacement for one that was stolen. I was happy to find it on Amazon!!"
3,Difficult to pick the best?,"This BEST OF album does not quite hit the nail on the head. Perhaps there is too much to choose from...It does go from Belfast to California, and covers the years.You also get the lyrics in the CD cover, likeHer name is G-L-O-R-I-AJackie Wilson said, It was ""Reet Petite"".And ""Have I told you lately that I love you"" goes down in the Sinatra/crooner collection of classic love songs."
4,Uplifting,"Whether it's rock, blues, gospel, R&B, soul, jazz or something in between, these songs have one thing in common. They are uplifting, musically and lyrically, starting with the perky ""Bright Side of the Road"". Some will get you moving, like the lively ""Brown Eyed Girl"", ""Jackie Wilson Said"", or the punchy horn section of ""Wild Night"", ""Full Force Gale"" and ""Domino"". The confident strut of ""Cleaning Windows"" is downright addicting. Then there are the spirituals, such as ""Whenever God Shines His Light"" and ""Dweller on the Threshold"". Previously, all I knew of him were the songs played on ""classic rock"" radio, but the lesser known tracks are equally strong. There are only a couple in my opinion that seem out of place with the rest. As for the vast majority, you won't be able to get them out of your head."
4,like this band,we don't hear a lot of this band in australia mores the pity.wish modern music was more like this their music at least has a beat not like that rap c--p
3,Passable time killer,The Recruit is no THE SPY THAT CAME IN FROM THE COLD. Elemetary my dear Watson.
5,very good movie,"pacino shines in this movie with many twist and turns, that have you in constant guessing."
4,Good,The Recruit was one of the coolest movies to come out about the CIA. Colin Farrell and Al Pacino did a terrific cameo with each other. I would recommend anybody to get this movie.
4,Decent thriller that tries a bit too hard,"""The Recruit"" is a decent spy thriller about an up-and-coming CIA agent (Colin Farrell) being mentored by an old veteran (Al Pacino) in the ways of being a spy. This movie packs in the plot twists, deceptions and misinformation, often leaving the audience as much in the dark as the characters. At times it seems like it almost tries a little TOO hard to be edgy and warped, with more twists than really seem necessary. It's kind of like taking a good stew and throwing in more ingredients than you really need, deadening the taste.Still, if you can put that past you, it's a pretty exciting movie, a decent action flick, and it really shows off the talents of Pacino and Farrel, who were both made to play the roles they've taken on. Definitely worth a rental, and even worth buying if you're really into spy movies that are a bit more realistic than James Bond."
3,Colin Farrell's Stock Is Rising,"""The Recruit"" is just a stepping stone for Colin Farrell. This fast paced action movie is a ""C"" at best. There is too many twists and turns for anyone to catch up with. James Clayton (Farrell) is a CIA in training where ""nothing is what it seems."" Clayton is recruited by Walter Burke (Pacino) and taken to ""the farm"" to learn all that is to know about the CIA. There Clayton finds out that everything is a test. Even his relationship with a fellow recruit. Pacino pulls off another tiring role. Farrell is getting better with each role he's in. (See Phone Booth) Overall, I thought that the story was new, but just because it was something new doesn't mean it was great."
2,Didnt like it,Pacino will do anything these days it seems. Not a good movie at all. Also continues Mr. Ferrils box office poison position in Hollywood. Why do people pay the man when everything he performs in fails utterly?
2,Did Anyone Say Age Discrimination?,"Yes, without exaggerating, that's what this movie is all about. (Of course, the usual sex and hormones, too!) The 20-somethings of the world are taking everything over, even Al Pacino's high paying job!There's a real message in this movie, which probably went over 99% of people's heads. We over-the-hill types are discriminated against all the time in the workplace because we are simply over 40 years of age. A landmark federal law even had to be passed to protect us from the rest of you young-ens!While the movie takes it to ridiculous lengths, pay very close attention to Al Pacino's emotional speech at the very end of the movie. It's absolutely the only redeeming thing about this pathetic Bourne Identity rip-off!"
3,rent me,"In short, Not bad. Nothing intelligent. The chick was hot, Pachino was decent and it was pretty exciting.Worth a rent, but not a purchase."
2,Entertaining but silly,"This movie comes from a world in which the CIA only employees good looking, athletic, top of their class engineers who are very happy to sit in high tech classrooms learning how to use weapons just to get low pay. So of course the plot leaves everything to be desired, as does, for the most part, the acting. The sinister twist in the plot is of course silly, and the MIT engineer nods knowingly at the technobabble.If you want to watch a good spy thriller, watch Smiley's People instead. The acting is superb and it is much more entertaining. If you want to go for some action, watch The Professional instead."
3,Just A Stepping Stone For Farrell,"""The Recruit"" is just a stepping stone for Colin Farrell. This fast paced action movie is a ""C"" at best. There is too many twists and turns for anyone to catch up with. James Clayton (Farrell) is a CIA in training where ""nothing is what it seems."" Clayton is recruited by Walter Burke (Pacino) and taken to ""the farm"" to learn all that is to know about the CIA. There Clayton finds out that everything is a test. Even his relationship with a fellow recruit. Pacino pulls off another tiring role. Farrell is getting better with each role he's in. (See Phone Booth) Overall, I thought that the story was new, but just because it was something new doesn't mean it was great."
2,holder poorly designed,"The lock and unlock knob does not work properly. I have difficulties to unlock the holder. The control knob can be turned around. The knob should only have two positions. Also, it should be designed with lables, such as ""lock"" and ""unlock"", for the two positions."
3,"Looks great, but......","I was so excited when I saw this advertised. It matches my Cuisinart Coffeemaker and I thought it would be great in my new kitchen. The vault itself is beautiful (just what I wanted), but the knives are not of the quality I expected. They are very light-weight -- the handles are hollow-core. Also, you cannot put the steak knives in the dishwasher as they will get rust spots (I learned the hard way, but was able to remove the spots). I don't use the steak knives anymore because they really are not heavy enough, only the cooking knives, and these are handwashed and dried."
5,I AM SAMURAI,"nice lookin knife holder...beats the conventional knife block holder...all knives are sharp and cuts through all items without any problems. was so pleased with my set, I bought another one for my sister who was also eyeing my set once I got it."
1,Just Boring.,"I have no idea why anyone would pass out at hearing these stories. Perhaps they had an unrelated medical illness? Or many it was a psychosomatic reaction to hearing stupid, 'shocking', trash. Some of the stories were interesting. Some. There was not one that lingered with me. Even ""Guts"", the most infamous of them did not not really leave me with anything.Palahniuk just made up ridiculous stories of how grotesque people can become. But they were ridiculous and boring.This is just supposed to be a 'shock-a-thon' that hipsters can read and say they 'get'. For a book with similarly detached and stupid 'shocking' things, check outThe Painted Bird (Transaction Large Print Books)by Jerzy Kosinski. If you like Haunted, you'll like that one too.BOOOORING!What's truly disturbing is a book like Requiem for a Dream. You care about the characters and their descent to hell is horrifying."
1,Less than one,"I'm no prude, but this book sinks below what could be described as depravity. Horrible."
2,Style over substance,"This book has an interesting concept, but unfortunately it isn't executed well. It's overhanded attempt at satire is unfortunate, especially from someone who has shown themselves to be quite talanted."
4,Not His Best - Still A Good Read!,"I agree....2 stars for the main story, 5 stars for the short stories.I just finished the book last night. I did enjoy the short stories more than the main story that seemed very contrived and strained to pull it all together. However, that said, a Chuck book is better than 90% of anything out there.This is no Fight Club or Choke (my two favorites from Chuck) but this book will please his loyal fans."
2,Tedious,"Quite tedious, and hopelessly desperate in its attempt to shock, Haunted is so poorly constructed I had to force myself to finish it. Which is really a shame, because the premise is terrifc and very promising. But it's the execution that leaves me cold. Palahniuk's characters - and their bad short stories and even worse poems - are so outre, but so obvious, that reading this novel is akin to being kicked in the gut repeatedly. The first few blows smart, but you are so numb by the end that it's all absolutely empty and meaningless. No subtlety, no variety, and no humor. This is not my first Palahniuk novel, but it might just be my last."
5,"Dude, this is a very entertaining read","While this book is definitly not for everyone, I really did enjoy reading it. Some of the stories were so great, and I must say I was interested the whole time. This book is pretty gross so if you don't wanna hear about people chopping off their body parts, please don't read. I by no means felt good after this book, actually it freaked me the crap out. But thats what I want in a book, something to stir things up a bit. If you like Chuck, then you will like this book."
1,"Some of the short stories are entertaining, the book isn't","Without repeating others too much, save yourself a headache and read his short stories rather than this. Gratuitious violence and gore doesn't make for a good plot. My bookseller told me that many copies are being returned by Palahniuk fans because they are SO disappointed in this one."
1,Total Waste of Time,"I was in the mood for a good, scary summer read. What I got was one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. It was a complete waste of my time. Don't bother!"
1,this book is miserable,"it is vital that you understand that your life will be worse if you decide to read this book. reading it is like having an extended conversation with the most arrogant, unlikable person you've ever met. poorly drawn, strictly unlikable characters + transparent attempts at arrogantly detached humor + countless events straight out of a middle school gross-out joke contest = gut-wrenchingly unreadable novel. various obvious, adolescent points are reinforced countless times in many unpleasant ways. this is my first exposure to this author and i will certainly never attempt another of his books. it deserves zero stars, which is not an option on this site."
3,Like twisted versions of The Twilight Zone,"If you are a fan of Palahniuk, then you will enjoy this book. WHile not his best work, there are a few stories that are memorable and intriguing, while some just make you want to skip right over them. I'm still not sure what he was trying to accomplish in tying all these short stories together, but I was more into each individual story then the back story that he lays down. If you ever wanted to know what The Twilight Zone would be like if it was on HBO, here are the episodes. A good read, not the best."
2,Reads like a collection of rough drafts,"Have you ever read Asimov's I, Robot? Haunted is kind of like that: A bunch of short stories strung together by a loose over-all narrative.The difference here is that, while Asimov's stories were more or less self-contained, each with their own distinct begining, middle and end, most of Palahniuk's 'short stores' read more like the set up for a larger story. Reading it feels like, as the title of this review suggests, looking through a folder full of Palahniuk's ideas that never made it to book form. Sure, some aren't without their merits. Some are interesting, or even genuinely entertaining. The rest are clearly meant to shock and appall by any means necessary. But really, if you're still reading Palahniuk's books expecting some greater meaning or purpose beyond mindless entertainment and shock value, you're missing the point.If you're still thinking of Palahniuk's books as ""literature"", the joke's on you."
5,Oh Snap!,"My first Palahniuk book was ""Lullaby"" in 8th grade. This was the next book of his that I read and let me tell you I was not prepared for the leap between the two. ""Haunted"" has some of the most graphic descriptions I've ever read, and at some points I even felt faint, however, I LOVE this book. It has got to be one of my favorites that he has done. The story is compelling, but becomes even more so with the main characters' side stories alternating with the main plot. It delves into the darkest corners of the human condition and explores them in a way I have personally never seen before. So if you have a strong stomach (I recommend you read ""Guts"" while sitting and with an empty stomach) and find the macabre and psychological thrillers to be your cup of tea then I would definitely check out ""Haunted."""
4,gratuitously gross yet compulsive reading...,"'Haunted: A Novel' is actually a collection of short stories woven together into a larger story. The larger story involves a group of misfits, all of whom have very bizarre aliases (eg, Director Denial, Duke of Vandals, Missing Link), kidnapped in a building for what was supposed to be a writers' retreat. Each of the characters eventually give us there own short story, often about their own twisted life. However almost consistent throughout the book are scenes of graphic violence, ... really horrific stuff, albeit sometimes it is used to a comic effect. It's hard to say whether this XXX rated gore adds any value other than to shock the reader. Nonetheless, 'Haunted...' is a very curious read. Some of the short stories are quite good, and the main story itself is quite unique. Certainly Chuck Palahniuk deserves kudos for originality.Bottom line: gross and entertaining in equal measures. Recommended."
3,Crazy good book,"This book jumps between three 'sections' each relate to the characters but in different ways, such as stories written by the characters which help you to understand their backgrounds better."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!! READ ANYTHING ELSE!,"I stopped reading it at the 200th page. I got over reading it really fast. I truely tried and hoped it would get better and some how catch my attention but it did not. The stories in between the main storie were not half bad but all together it was confusing, boring and not worth reading. When you cannot get to like any of the characters theres a problem. This is the first and only books i have never finished, that says something since i have read hundreds of books."
2,What happened?,"I loved Chuck's previous work, but this seems like something else entirely. Please find your dark soul again, my man! Don't go soft, we need you."
2,buy a Ween album instead,"My guess is he must have signed a massive publishing contract or maybe chuck's editor is afraid of what might happen to her if she quits. This man's imagination has led him far away from literature and deep, deep, deep into the muggy and humid black tarpits of cult fiction. Which hey, if that's what you're after, then cool. Just know now it ain't lit. It doesn't stimulate, it titillates.I recommend White Pepper or Mollusk. (Ween know they're being childish.)"
3,Gross out for the sake of gross out,"I typically like Palahniuk, but I felt this book lacked a strong central theme. Well, the theme was there - people will do anything, I mean anything, to be famous. The premise is that a dozen or so ""authors"" (aka, people that want to esacpe from real life) go to a writers' retreat to hone their skills. Once they realize this isn't going to be a typical retreat, each person tries to find a way to be the most famous once they are released from the ""horrifying"" ordeal.People will do anything to be famous - I get it. But each new vignette and each new one-upping injury or sabotage to their survival chances does not add to the book. It's like a demonstration of Chuck Palahniuk's gross-out and nightmare capabilities. These are already well-known and are couched in actual plots much better in his other books. Very disappointing..."
5,I Am a Cat: Three Volumes in One,Delightful! I really enjoyed this book! A fascinating tour of another time and another culture. A work of genius.
2,WOW! NOT FUNNY!,This is a very hard book for younger teens. Our 8th grade class has not understood the high class chinese philosphy that the cat uses we can never figure out whether he is being sarcastic or being real. Our teacher laughs at us because he thinks that it is so simply to follow. I have noticed that is is not a good book of the younger generation of kids unless they know alot about chinese philosophy!
5,neighborhood fun,these are so much fun! the quality is amazing! my daughter talks to her 5 year old girlfriend who lives a few houses away from us on the walkie talkies! too cute!
1,horrible!,like the reviews...does NOT work!? How can they sell these??? Santa brought them for my girls. They were sooo excited until they realized they DON'T work! We tossed them out for the garbage man to TAKE AWAY!
1,Don't waste your money,They pretty much don't work. The static is much louder than who ever is speaking. Don't waste your money!!
1,Don't waste your money!,This toy was given to my daughter for Christmas and the idea is cute but we get better use out of them as radios than walkie-talkies. My daughter doesn't understand why music comes through and not our voices. I hate that I wasted $$ on batteried for these. Save your money!
3,Mamodo Battles,"Ever since Zatch Bell went off of Toonami I still watch it to this day, it's a great anime (though the slightly more mature version ""Konjiki no Gash Bell!!"" is far superior)However I expected a fun game but all this is is a repetitive mess.It's entertaining for a while but after you unlock everything (which I've done) it gets boring.Only for Zatch Bell fans really."
4,mostly good transaction,"The product was received in excellent condition, exactly as described. I requested and payed for expedited shipping but received it via standard shipping."
5,A Staple in the Rotation,"I have had this CD since 1992 and it remains an all time favorite. What ever music tastes one has, this is sure to compliment on various levels...AMP"
1,Outdated and not informative,"Don't waste your money. This book is outdated and barely touches on the computer. I'm sure back in its time, it may have been helpful but it's written like a text book instead of a reference guide and I just didn't find one helpful thing in it."
1,This book is a wast of time,"wall reading this book on thing jumped at me. This man makes his money on all the other things he sells. This book is one big add,For all he's other books. You can find other books with more info."
2,What A Crappy Book,"I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it. I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away. He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way. The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures. It did have one thought that I really liked: ""Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge. If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?"""
5,Excellent resource for teaching Biology at a Christian School,"I am very impressed at the quality of production and content. Well done, please keep it up!!!! Would love to have lots of these types of videos at our school. Thank you!!!! Adrienne, Australia."
1,As if science never existed,"This course will walk you through the bible in an attempt to misrepresent science so that it conforms to the bible, thereby leaving your children misdirected, confused, and ignorant."
4,"Worked well, although the spermicide had a smell....","Worked well, although the spermicide had a smell."
2,"Worth reading, but not satisfying","A slow build up to anti-climax. Little depth, little action. As a Traveller player since year-one, I had to read it. I had hoped that it would be good enough that I could use it to lure others into playing. Alas, it is not. At the last, when the words ""to be continued"" appeared, I said a small prayer that sometime between now and then they would find a writer."
3,Well done.,"Well written, nicely paced. I really enjoyed this story. Only one issue. It could have been longer? I almost felt like it was missing something, but it wasn't, really, it wasn't. Tight, well edited. What was lacking was that it had the potential to be one of those big ones...everything was there to go all the way. I think you cheated yourself Andrea. All that said, I understand the pressures of the word count demons and I really enjoyed it. If you ever decide to rewrite it, the Andrea Version, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
4,works fine unless it gets clogged.,i couldnt get a filter to work over my auto siphon so i had to go without on a puree flavored beer. bad mistake. both the siphon and the wand clogged. other than that the bottling wand works like a charm. it is also very easy to clean... the bottom bit pops off. be careful as there is a tiny plastic widget and a spring that can get lost if you tip it. carefully remove them and clean everything. reassembly is a snap.
4,For the budding manager,"This is a great book to understand the fundamentals of organizational behaviour. It is simple to understand, and the excellent layout and graphics make it enjoyable and ignite your curiosity. I read it from cover to cover in a matter of days. However, I do agree that more relevant case studies and applications should have been included."
4,required for class,"good information, can be dry at times. even though it was mandatory reading it couldve been a lot worse. not bad for the money."
3,Disappointing but there are other sellers out there,I choose 3 stars because the book is readable. I payed more amount of money expected an almost brand new book but its full of markings. I have payed for used books many times over amazon.com but this book has left me very disappointed. I hope they reconsider the books condition before choosing the price since we all have experience with these things. I wont use this company in the near future until i deem it necessary.The book overall is very good. It is easy to ready and a lot of help to understand most organizational behavior themes.
5,Good deal!,The book was in great shape and it arrived promptly. I was very satisfied with this purchase.
5,HARD HITTING DETECTIVE SERIES,"BRENNER is one of the grittiest, hard-hitting detective shows I've ever watched. It has a film noir atmosphere, and does not shy away from taking provocative stands on a myriad of issues. For example, one episode explores the right of the individual to say ""no"" to the peer group pressure of a newly-formed vigilante group, a concept that strikes at the heart of functioning democratic societies. The only complaint of I have with this boxset is that BRENNER did not have more episodes to include. Nevertheless, anyone who loves those shows from THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION which specialize in provoking reflection/discussion on germaine issues confronting society will not be disappointed with this truly excellent series."
4,"Hopeful for 10,000 copies","I was a little disappointed when my first cartridges started failing on my Brother 2700CN. I contacted the manufacture and it was revealed that the starter cartridges are only half filled. This is not communicated anywhere on the information sent with the printer, so I was a bit disappointed. Replacement cartridges are almost the same price as a new printer, but then I would again be back to starter cartridges.The cartridges are easy to install and the system jumped right back into functionality with the new cartridges. Unlike inkjet cartridge printers that allow you to run the cartridges till they are bone dry, the Brother's system stops printing with reportedly empty cartridges.If the new cartridge lives up to its claim of 10,000 copies, then I will be quite satisfied. I mostly purchased this for the freedom from have to buy inkjet cartridges every 4-6 months. I guess we will see..."
3,WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS CD,"AVERAGE CD...AVERAGE SONGS....NOTHING BAD BUT NOTHING GREAT EXCEPT ""KING OF WISHFUL THINKING'. I ALWAYS LIKED THEIR WHITE SOUL , MOTOWN , JAZZ LESANINGS AND PETE'S RASPY VOICE."
2,So-So,"My husband suffers from Ankylosing Spondylitis. I checked out every back book I could find at all of our local libraries to read everything I possibly could on that disease and every other type of back ailment. This was the least informative of them all, and I feel as though this book only skimmed the surface of back pain in general. Each mini section was very short, and I found some of the medication information to be incorrect (I am not a doctor but we've had quite the experience with all types of medication). I think this book would be a great place to start for someone just learning about back pain, but if you've read more in depth books, this one wouldn't teach you something you didn't already know."
1,Too much of trhowback,The storyline and camera work were too much of throwback to my drug enhanced youth of the early 80's. I found nothing redeeming in this film at all.
2,"The Underground City, or, the Child of the Cavern",I must confess that I had hoped for more of a Sci-Fi bent in this novel. The story is engaging and moves quickly.
3,"long on psychology, short on practicality","The Emotional Life of a Toddler is a good book for you if you're interested in the attachment theory or attachment parenting viewpoint of toddler psychology, and this book does read like a psychology text. It offers some insight into the whys, which will help you understand your toddler as a whirlwind of emotion and contradiction; however, the book does not offer any hows for living day-to-day with your tot. Therefore, if you are looking for practical advice and tips, skip this book and head to Toddler 411, Pocket Parent, No Cry Discipline Solution, or the dozen of other books that address toddler behavior."
5,I found He Sleeps,"Great CD but I was disappointed when ""He Sleeps"" was not on there. Looked for it everywhere. You need to look on You Tube for ""Toni Baker"" and listen to his version. He plays it perfectly. He also sells it if you want but you need to send him an email and ask. His email: tonibakerboy@btinternet.comHope you all enjoy it as much as I do!"
5,Pretty Woman,Best 80s soundtrack ever enough said! If you love this movie you will want the soundtrack classic:)
5,Pretty Woman soundrack,"CD is great!! The cd is just like ""brand new""!! Arrived in great shape. Shipping took a while, although arrived in the time window stated during purchase."
3,Better than the movie.,"On the plus side, this includes great songs from ""David Bowie"", ""Roxette"", ""Robert Palmer"", and ""The Red Hot Chili Peppers"". On the negative side, the soundtrack always reminds me of that moron from ""Seinfeld"", and the highly over-rated ""Julia Roberts"". The only pretty woman I remember in this film was ""Laura San Giacomo""."
4,A hard book to put down.,"Miss Ophelia was one of the best books I've read this year. It started out slow for me in the beginning, but after reading one-third of the book I had a hard time putting it down. My favorite character was Uncle Willie. He didn't believe in keeping secrets from his 11-year old niece Isabel which I felt was very important. He also had a great sense of humor. When you're open and honest with young people you can prevent them from making the same mistakes you and others have made in the past. I wish someone had done that for me."
5,Extremely well written and interesting story,"I really enjoyed this book. The characters are well defined, true to life and memorable. The story was easy to read, well-paced and had interesting sub-plots. I also read Ms. Smith's next book -- Ring Around the Moon -- which I also enjoyed as well."
5,A WONDERFULLY WRITTEN NOVEL!,"My book club recently read ""MISS OPHELIA"" as our March Book Selection and over 80% of the sistahs in the book club (Circle of Friends II) rated this book a ""10"". It is a wonderfully written novel that you will find hard to put down. After meeting Belly, her mom, others in the town and Lord...UNCLE WILLIE, you will not be able to put it down until the last page...and then you will be sad...because the story comes to an end. If you are looking for a good book...gift...you definitely need to pick this one up!!!!!"
1,Careful - test first before use,"I have a dark brown leather recliner and my dog scratched up the seat of it making his nest.I tried the leather dye and it began to remove the color of the leather. I stopped, but the damage was done. Now I have to try something else to fix the colorless spot."
1,"NOT the original ""Joyride"" version","I have no idea if this was taped in concert, but I bought it strictly for the title song, and it's definitely not the original 1991 version... so yeah, I'm pi$$ed. That's all."
1,Defective Part,"Received part on time. However, when I installed it, it leaked. No amount of unscrewing/re-screwing resulted in success. I sent it back and got a refund. I'm a bit gun-shy regarding getting another. No big deal in that my money was refunded promptly. But, it is still a hassle when a part does not work."
5,Another good (sort of) stand-alone?,"Of course, there's a reference to one of the characters thinking about fleeing to Ventria, so you never know if the island of the Ikenas and Highlands aren't northwest of Drenai...However, that's not the point. This is an excellent book about the nature of heroism and legend that twists and turns throughout history.Unlike most of his books, Morningstar is narrated in the first person, in this case by one Owen Odell, a bard/magician who meets and befriends a rakish thief named Jarek Mace, and tells us his story.As others have said, it's a decidedly different manner of writing for Mr. Gemmell; every other of his books that I've read have been third-person, before and since. It's a very good read, and quite fast, too; it's much thinner than his normal books, and read much faster, which is sometimes a good thing.All in all, I rather enjoyed this novel, and highly recommend it."
4,One of my favorite David Gemmell books,"My favorite David Gemmell stories are the Rigante series. Having said that, I love Morningstar. In fact, I've read it twice and will most likely come back to it again when I'm in the mood for a great fairytale. I hope the word Fairytale doesn't turn anyone away from this story. Others have described the plot so I won't repeat that other than to say, Jarek Mace is one of my favorite reluctant heroes."
5,An awesome compilation!!! JUMP JIVE and WAIL!!!,The best Louis Prima compilaton out there!!! 26 great tunes all on one little shiny disc!!! Recommended!!! Two thumbs up!!! AWESOME!!! Five Stars!!! A+
3,Its ok :-(,"My dogs seem to love these bones, but for the price, they are expensive. I thought it would have more in it. I have to see if I can get them somewhere else for a better deal"
2,Not very technical for IMS COBOL programming,This book is not very technical. It is Not useful for an IMS COBOL programmer.It seems more like a sales ad for IBM.
5,Read Hungry,"Tony Dunbar's droll detective series featuring the laconic lawyer Tubby Dubonnet is certainly one of the better evocations of the Crescent City produced in the past thirty years. Tubby devours not only po'boys and numerous other New Orleans delicacies, but he also embodies a benign gumshoe ethic that makes a book like this such fun to read. A tad weak on plot, thankfully, the book puts you in the company of a worldly, energetic gourmand who treats the slings and arrows of the case he's involved with as so many distractions from the real business of living. Dunbar, as a writer, comes across as the epitome of an appreciator, an observer who marvels at the humanity in front of him without genuflecting. New Orleans has taken some big hits in the past decade, but in Tony Dunbar's wonderful Tubby Dubonnet series disasters have met their match. Spend an evening or two with Tubby and you'll be delightfully transformed."
3,Arrived in a timely fashion,Concerned as I have not seen any more blossoms since its arrival. Lots of green leaves.
4,great story from john jakes,this is a wonderful beginning of a different kind of book by john jakes. his sweeping novels of historical periods are waaaaaay different from his series of Brak.i loved how i was drawn into the story. now i have to locate the other books and sit down to a good long read!
4,Brak the Barbarian,"This in some early John Jakes, before he got big with the historical fiction and was doing the sci-fi/fantasy stuff. I've been a fan of the Character for nearly forty years and really enjoyed Zelazny's reading. His brak is just a step away from R.E. Howards classic fantasy characters. A good read and fun to listen to."
5,Skyclad intro,Good for those who like the first 2 Sabbat releases and are interested in branching out into slightly new sounds. Not as heavy as Sabbat but if you like one you will probably like the other.
5,girl who likes nude men,"the title tells u exactly what youll get in this new video about the latest real worlders!! love of nudity!! and we all know thats what ppl love now adays, to see hott guys parade around with nutin on!! so get this vhs today, i promise u wont regret it!!"
4,Real World You Never Saw:From New York,"Real World rules and this one is no exception, a must have for any Real World lover. Find out what REALLY happened, what they couldn't show on TV ;)"
4,"So close, so close...","The problem with the ""Oh in Ohio"" is that it was `produced' and `marketed' as a comedy. At its core, it is not. It would be a much better film, and actually much funnier, if it were re-edited as a dramedy.Many of it's comic moments work, and could be far more effective if the film was about 45 degrees more serious. But too often the comedy is either underdeveloped or overwrought. The film, as presented, tries too hard to be funny, especially with a cast so gifted at understatement.Oh's cast, the skill of the director, et al, to capture their obvious magic and the film's story concepts make it, in many ways, a rewarding film. If you can forgive some of it's minor excesses, you will begin to feel what it's like to be kissed by Posey, Rudd, Barton, David, Bailey, Graham & DeVito. But it could have been so much richer: you could have begun to feel what it's like to be loved by them."
4,Larry Dunn's Got it right,"I recently caught Larry Dunn and his trio live in at a small venue club in Napa, Calif. A very tight set that was at least 90 minutes and never let up. His material is all original and he displayed a good feel for not overdone, tasty guitar work. Good solid vocals, he certainly gets the most out of his range. Dunn is definitely good enough to have a major label at his back.Some favorites on this disc are 'You call this love"" a soulful my woman is cheating on me groove and check out his Texas strut on ""Carolina Moon"". Yo'Mambo and ""Jumpin at the Golden gate"" as well as ""Crazy for you"" deserve honorable mentions. C'mon Larry, lets have a bit more of this."
3,great air flow,This fan puts out a lot of air. Disappointed in how much noise it makes. It was advertised as being quiet. Even on low setting it is louder than I expected.
2,disappointed on presentation of product,"It was nice to see a tapout product, but the characters were not what threw me off i expected this to show me combat moves and hints not just watch some freaks in a bus just be bad asses."
4,Jessica - a great but late discovery,"This is a great cd. I am amazed that this artist was not more successful in Australia.I you enjoy How Will I Know, you will enjoy the rest."
2,Where's the beef,"She's an amazing actress...gives substance to the vacant Olsen name. Regretfully, there is zero resolution in the movie, and may leave you a bit hollow at the end."
1,SOOOO Disappointed,I really tried to make it to the end of this movie cause I paid to watch it and I wanted to finish it>>>$3.99 can get me a gallon of gas>>> so I did not want to waste my money:) BUT I had to fast forward this movie just to get to the end so I could stop watching it. I cannot get the other reviews saying how great it was>>NOT!! DO not waste your money.
5,Martha Marcy May Marlene,"Guess what, everyone? The younger sister of the Olsen twins can act, and she's really good! That seemed to be one of the big takeaways from last year's Martha Marcy May Marlene, which has already won several awards from critics societies and is currently nominated for four Indie Spirit awards. But Elizabeth Olsen wasn't the only one making an impressive first impression; the haunting psychodrama about a young woman who escapes a cult and attempts to piece her life back together in the aftermath is also the debut of writer-director Sean Durkin. Cutting seamlessly between the past and present, Durkin brings the viewer into his heroine's crippling paranoia, which grows increasingly worse until it becomes unclear what reality is and what her mind has fabricated. Martha Marcy May Marlene is an effective thriller that creeps up on you and stays with you for days."
2,Fizzle...,"We were excited to finally see this movie, which had an interesting premise and cast. But what started with alot of promise built on good dialogue and character development ended with what could be described as a quit. Literally, you get the sense that the director and writer just decided they couldn't fit the story into the budget or had gotten themselves in too deep and just wanted to wrap it up. Based on that alone, I wouldn't recommend the movie. The feeling of disappointment is just too great."
1,save your time and money,"This film is extremely dissapointing. Hailed as a psychlogical thriller, it is a story of abuse that is painful to watch.most of the characters are shallow and poorly played. People in real life have been neglected abused and preyed upon This story made me ill and angry with how they treated this subject matter."
5,Awesome carseat for dolls!!!,"Our daughter(2 1/2 years) loves baby car seats so when I saw this one, I thought it was the perfect gift for her. She absolutely loves it!! It looks so real and she loves the seat belts so she can buckle up her babies!! The buckles open a bit hard so we have to help her with opening them but that is worth it when you see how much she loves it. The quality is awesome, it feels strong and like it will last a long time. Great toy for a great price!!"
5,Great Album--Spooky and Overlooked,"This was the last R.E.M. album I bought (well, aside from the stuff that's come out since I bought it). I basically didn't really want it; I was just completing the collection. I listened to it a couple times and then put it away, wholly unimpressed with it. Then I started listening to it a couple summers ago while taking a chemistry class at a local college. I would take the tape version that my brother had and just listen to it on the bus on the way there and back. I fell in love with it. Lovely, lovely album--one of their best, if you ask me."
3,works but is falling apart,I like these because they're the only socks I've found that don't leave indentation marks around my ankles. The bad part is yes as the other reviewer stated they are completely falling apart after wash one. The ankle cuff tops are completely fraying and falling apart. For this price per pair I wish they were better made. Will look for a better alternative for my money.
1,It's time for Kathleen Hanna to give up.,"give me a break. aren't you happy about anything? whine whine whine, men suck, the police suck, everything should go to hell etc. it's called wit, kid, and you don't seem to have it."
3,The book covers the topics of VB5 well,"This book is an excellent tool to study VB5 with. I have used Sybex books to pass Win Arch I and II on the first try. I started the New Riders VB5 book and was very disappointed in the content. I give this book 3 starts because the testing engine is really bad. However, this book + Transcender VB5 testing engine = passed VB5 test on the first try"
4,"Well written and organized, very good preparation tool.","I tend to be critical of computer books, but I can recommend this one. I read the book and supplemented it with the Transcender tests. Three and a half weeks after receiving the materials I passed the exam with a score of 934."
1,Way to modern for me.,"Boy I am new to ordering movies with a computer and ordered this modern verson not noticing the original was available. I saw the original as a teenager and it scared me to death. This modern thing really ruins this really acary old movie. I would at least see the original. It is a whole lot better. The helicopters and blood and guts just ruined a great classic scary movie. At least I have the original coming now. Course I may not be up to date with all this fast moving action stuff. Really don't like any of it. Later Lance Haynes San Diego, Ca."
3,Neither my husband nor I were very impressed ...,"Neither my husband nor I were very impressed with the taste of this product. Although it is supposed to be all-natural, it has a very chemical taste. The mint flavor isn't really noticeable until after you spit it out. When it's first in your mouth, it tastes really bad! However, I noticed that a very sore spot on my gum cleared up after using it only twice. Could that be coincidence? I don't think it was. I think it had something to do with the mouthwash. So it was worthwhile for me to continue using it."
1,I tried the product once and threw it ...,I tried the product once and threw it away. It tasted like I was drinking alcohol with soap in it. It had a minty aftertaste but the initial taste is pretty nasty. The aftertaste was extremely strong also. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I'd stick with Scope.
3,Helpful,Work well for the price. Able to learn from it but some of the pronounciations are hard to develop and can also vary within the context. Overall not bad for the price but less than can be hoped for.
3,Though it hurts...,"I mut say, as much as i admire van-vogt's writing's, that this one is'nt very good. Fast paced, but not deep. Interesting, but not memorable charecters. The plot is somewhat confused, as if babbled without preceeding thougt. It felt as though I've realy read parts of a book instead of a whole one."
2,"Good on floors, bad on carpets.","As advertised, this vacuum has fairly good suction. However, since there is no agitator it doesn't work well at all on carpets. It does do a pretty decent job on floors though.I purchased it to use in an apartment I had to live for a long-term work project so I was looking for something inexpensive. This fit the bill. When I get back to the house I think this will make an excellent car vacuum.As mentioned by the other reviewers, it does get very hot but it hasn't shut itself off on me...yet."
2,Way overpriced,I needed one of these right away and didn't have time to run all over town looking for one so I broke down and bought it. It works but the quality is average at best and is overpriced by about ten times.
5,Renea (Kamryns Mommy),I love the fact that anywhere we go I know that my daughter has a clean surface to eat on. A++++ Product!
3,Rising Star,"From the moment I sampled ""With Out You"" I knew that strong handsome voice had to be mine. The vocals have a soft country/contemporary feel and the lyrics to each song on the cd speak to the romantic in everyone. If you are looking for a rising star, this album is a must have for your collection."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!,I can not say enough about this book. I absolutely loved it. I am a Geography teacher and I am ordering a class set for my classroom. I think my students will fall in love with this book the same way I did. You should buy this book without even thinking twice. You will laugh and learn so much about the world from first hand experience. Enjoy and BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!
4,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"I was very impressed by the great illustrations in this book. Colorful and eyedrawing they gave a clear picture of the words you were reading. Very nice job!The story is about a little girl named Ariel and her mother Carlotta who flys balloons.Ariel wanted to be with her mother on the day of the big race and she stowed away, not telling her Mother.This is where the fun begins as Ariel and her Mom battle to win the race and Ariel ends up in the lake. A cute read, one you will enjoy reading to your child."
2,Chock full of errors,"If you understand the basics of AF SLR photography, do not buy this book. It does do a good job of introducing the basics, but unfortunately it falls flat on its face when it comes to explaining the features of your new N80. As other have noted, the book is rife with errors in description of the N80's features and functions. It is difficult to believe the authors had this camera in hand when the book was written. I found the manual that comes with the camera to be much more useful."
4,Steve Miller Band,I like this CD alot. This group had some gret hits along with some not so familiar to me. But as soon as Amazon told me there was a second one I jumped right on it. The music comes from the period of really good bands and this is another one. There are plenty of big hits.
1,Buyer Beware,"Now where do i start...Please read the whole review.1.The main thing is that the Phone processor is unstable. Shuts off when talking, texting or dialing. Not good when your on an important phone call. Cuts out on me about 2-3 times a day2. Antenna is weak. Doesn't pick up signels where my Razor did! Always has dead spots. Will cut out more than any other phone.3. Too thin! Need blue tooth to talk. Holding it is like holding a barbie phone to your ear4. Cannot lay on shoulder to talk. Must use bluetooth.5. doesn't have a function for Vibrate and Ringer. One or other6. My fingers aren't big and they still have a hard time hitting the keys accuratly. Keys are too smallI've had this phone for 6 months now and looking for a different one. I thought small was good but not for a phone. Fits in the pocket, picture is awesome but it doesn't make up for all negatives. I DO NOT RECOMMEND. TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO USES THE PHONE 5000 MINUTES A MONTH."
2,"Tri-Band is French for ""useless""","This phone looks super cool, but it's completely useless in the USA. it only works on one of the 2 GSM freqnencies (bands) in the US. This means that if you got a 4-bar signal with your old phone you'll get 2 now. Or maybe one or none.But the trouble doesn't stop there. The phone I got had the language set to French and only came with a French manual. On the Samsung website this phone doesn't even exist so you can't download the English manual from there. It took me about 30 frustrating minutes to figure out how to set the language to English.So back in the box it went, back to Amazon. Amazon was kind enough deduct the cost of that ""free super saver shipping"" from my refund, as well as making me pay the cost of shipping this worthless phone-shaped piece of plastic back to them."
4,Censors: Then & Now,My husband and I enjoyed all three. After seeing the uncensored version of 'Baby Face' we had to check and make sure we hadn't watched the censored version by mistake.By today's standards these movies would be considered PG13. Wish censors today had stricter standards.
5,Excellent collection of its kind.,"The three films in this collection are fine examples of pre-code Hollywood. In this edition the prints are at release quality. It's wonderful to be able to travel back to the period and experience the movie industry back then. Of the three Baby Face is the superior film, perhaps so because Barbara Stanwyck was so outstanding even back then in her mid-20s."
4,Baby Face steals the show!!!,"This is Warner's first set of many of pre-codes to be released under the Forbidden Hollywood in the next few years. Volume 2 will be out later this year with 6 films, instead of 3 and a new documentary. Starting in 2008, we'll be getting 2 sets per year!!!On to the review. Honestly I was disappointed when they announced only 3 films were going to be in the set, but Baby Face makes up for all that disappointment. Even today, the film shocks you because it is so brazenly sexual especially for such a film made in 1933. Red Headed Woman is my 2nd favorite. It gives Jean Harlow time to deliver her signature rapid fire delivery and I loved when she gets slapped in the face and says she loves it. My only real complaint with the set is that the first pressing of the discs were marked incorrectly with Baby Face being on the disc with Harlow's face on it and vice versa, but to my knowledge this has been smoothed out. Grade B"
2,Let down,"Having read all the books in this series I was very disappointed by this one. I'll give the next book a try when it comes out, but it looks like this series is really going down-hill fast."
4,An end to a new beginning,The Last Precinct was another great book written by Patricia Cornwell. After Black Notice I was afraid this would be the last book where she could use the characters that I have grown to love to read about. Her ending was very powerful and it leads to many new and different story lines.
1,A Waste of Time,"What a gigantic waste of time. The story isn't compelling; the plot doesn't resolve itself with clarity; the characters are shallow and unlikable.To make matters worse, the author portrays every male as sex-crazed, inherently evil, and shallow. Even the main character's male side kick is described as fat, slovenly, and shifty.The only surprise in this crime/mystery is that I actually finished it."
3,Forensic Pathologist or Action Figure?,"Kay Scarpetta continues to push herself past the edge of what many normal people just cannot accomplish. While a thrilling read, I found myself in certain parts, skimming over the words just to pick back up on the plot. I must admit I find that the Kay Scarpetta series to be much more riveting than Cornwell's other efforts, she must be doing something right since I keep reading her newest works. Keep it up Patricia, just, let Kay get a good night's sleep so she can continue shooting down helicopters with her laser beam eyes."
4,Need a study guide,"While I have read every Kay Scarpetta book written I felt woefully unprepared when reading this book. There were far too many refences to previous books, I could have used a study guide. Having said that I really enjoyed the novel and Cornwell's elegant writing."
2,The Last Precinct,"I believe that even bad Scarpetta is better than no Scarpetta and wouldn't think of missing a Cornwell book. However disappointing I found this book, what I found most disturbing was the author's usurping of Linda Fairstein, a real life person who also writes mysteries (though legal rather than medical) with herself as a model for the protagonist. The dedication to Fairstein seems like a forced nicety. I find it most disturbing that a character in a novel should be lifted both from a real living person and her alter ego in novels. Granted many Scarpetta characters are ""based"" on real people, but this seems too much. I await the next book with hopes of originality."
3,Drags,"Much more dialog than activity. Reading it is like watching paint dry. I keep waiting for some motion, action, anything."
2,"NOT ONE OF HER BEST, SADLY","I am, for lack of a better adjective, a Cornwell ""nut"" having read all of her Kay Scarpetta books. The main flaw in her latest creation is....confusion. Let's be honest - we read her forensic treasures for the mystery, intrigue and ""page-turning"" suspense! However, if there are (IF THIS IS INDEED POSSIBLE) too many twists and turns we lose track of her ingenuity - forced to sort through endless facts thrown in the ""mix"" rather than relish her tempting forensic tale. Another problem was how ""slow"" the beginning seemed with much talk about Kay's instability and psychological health after her brush with (at the end of ""Black Notice"") Chandonne.There is also, unlike her other Scarpetta masterpieces, no finality to the story. She, quite obviously,leaves us ""hanging"" (HOPEFULLY only 'til her next Scarpetta outing)- with a sloppy summation that, I feel, short-changes the reader!!!LONG LIVE KAY SCARPETTA!!!"
1,After thoughts,Most of this book consists of explanations that should have been in the previous book. First 100 pages: Zzzzzz. The balance not much better. Scarpetta needs to get some more interesting people in her life besides a ... niece and a cop friend (?) that even she detests most of the time. One star and four yawns.
2,VERY Disappointed - made me sleepy,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it boring, very long with little action, and not at all typical of Patricia Cornwell books I have read in the past. Her writing has become more psychological than action-based. So, if you like to read about thoughts and feelings and are not into much action and excitement this is a good book for you."
2,The Last Precint,"I don't know what has happened to Patricia and her wonderful writing ability. Something evidently is weighing very heavy on her mind these days, as it seems she has lost her touch. The book never seemed to take off and get you going as all her others in the past. Having been an avid Cornwell fan for years, I was very disappointed. Perhaps her private life is getting to be a too much for her to handle and to be able to write as she once did. This book was pure salami."
2,The Last Precinct,"Wow. I am very disappointed with this latest Kay Scarpetts novel.The first thirty-some pages are consumed by Kay's indignation over becoming a victim; a deformed maniac has come after Kay, his pursuer. I had to laugh that Kay was so troubled by this latest victimization, given that she has been stalked and nearly killed by at least three different serial killers whom she likewise investigated in past novels. Why is she acting like this is a first?! She should be used to being nearly murdered by now. Par for the course.Oh, Patricia, work harder next time."
3,??????,"I've been an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell since being introduced to her novel by a late friend. However, I found this book difficult to continue. At many times I forced myself to continue on wishing it would become a little more interesting. Upon reaching the ending I was terribly dissappointed. I will continue to remain a huge fan, but this book was the second worst to Hornets Nest.....and I just couldn't finish that one at all."
3,The Last Precinct,Good plot but much to wordy and seems the author wishes to impress us with her knowledge which we certainly do acknowledge however just too much of a good thing!
2,"""Sveglie"" (wake up) Dr. Kay","This book is the most tiresome of Cornwell's series. As always her explanations of medical procedures, evidence examination, autopsies, and etc. are incredibly educational. This is truly her art. However, the story line falters all the way up to the finale which does give this ""read"" a measure of redemptive value. This was her only book that had me wanting it to end out of sheer fatigue. I was tired of hearing about her depression, oppression, and ostracision. I wanted to reach out and smack the old doctor. Being Italiano myself I truly enjoy her ""preoccoupation"" with the culinary joys of cooking, eating, and the sanctity of a traditional Italian meal.This book leaves a lot of room for another sequel as I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to the ""nasty boys"" of this edition.Keep up the integrity Dr. Kay and start listening to Marino more often, will ya?! Don't be such a ""Testa de Gizo"" (head of cast iron)!!!"
1,Conspiracy theories,"I hated this book, but not for the reason I expected. Black Notice was so dark and depressing that I expected this one to be even more so. Actually, it was so sloppy and unbelievable that I just couldn't get involved in the plot.Aside from rather uninteresting introspection into Kay's personal history, this entire book consisted of rewriting the plot of two previous novels (Point of Origin, Black Notice) into an even more complicated conspiracy... and setting us up for future (and probably even more unbelievable) conspiracies in the next book.My proposed plot for the next one, at least as plausible as the conspiracies, is this: Kay awakes in a mental institution, receiving therapy for her delusions of grandeur, paranoia, and possibly multiple personality disorder. She really did kill Diane Bray, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The rest of the conspiracy was the product of her paranoia."
2,Disappointed....,"It took me almost 25 days to finish this book. Once, I have to stop, because the first few chapters were just self-pity, self-angry, and a bitter taste of life... I just have to read another book just to get away from those chapters. When I decided to finish it... oh well, I have to, I've paid for it... I don't think I would buy her next novel, I might just borrow it from the library to save money. Very disappointed!"
1,Boooooring!,"Most of the major writers of crime fiction get away with sloppy plotlines and mailed-in characterizations just as long as their base readership gets to see the same characters as in the book before. The Last Precinct is no exception. I was so bored that I simply could not slog through the whole thing. Too bad; if this one has even been remotely readable I might have moved on to Cornwell's other work. If you want to read a thriller with a little heart, pick up any of Michael Connelly's work, or one of relative newcomer Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novels. You owe it to yourself not to support lazy writing."
2,'POOR ME',"I'm only half way thru this one,and I've never heard so much""Bellyaching""! Poor Kay, she's getting old! Most of the bookso far, is full of discriptive adjectives on how terrible she feels about everything and every one.P.C. has always been one of my favorites, but I""m going to haveto nickname her ""The Queen of Superlatives"". The best part of this book is the picture on the back of thebook jacket."
1,I hated This Book,"I have all of Patricia Cornwell's [Kay Scarpetta Series] and I am sorry to say that her last book Black Sunday was terrible, so I should not have bothered to buy The Last Precinct. It was a total waste of my money. I don't know why Cornwell is even bothering to write anymore books. She seems to have lost her touch or doesn't really care to write any more. I guess she has made enough money. I am sick of her going on and on about Lucy and Kays love affairs. Cornwell is really making Kay one dumb lady. I guess I will no longer be buying Cornwells books if she keeps writing the junk she has in her last 4 books."
2,The beginning of the end?,"I waited for a while to say this. Every author can have a bad book or two. The transitional focus change from what might be seen as a bit more action to a reflective deeper character frankly flopped. I don't care not because the character isn't worth it but because the author doesn't carry it off.After reading the following books I wondered if this wasn't the first attempt to save something the author had grown bored with and serial characters can become boring. Other authors have started this transition leading to Best Sellers with only a few grunts of ""no"" from a few die hard fans of the other version of the writing. Branching off into other works is also a trait. The following books were way below standard for her. So far below I don't bother to even look to see if anything new is coming out nor do I buy them used when they do.Read this? Yes. It might be Kay's real farewell to us all."
3,What happened????,"I used to be an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell, that is until recently. The last 3 books have been a great disappointment. The characters Kay, Lucy and Marino are wonderful, but the story line needs work... lots of it. I used to wait in anticipation for her next book, but now I find myself having to make myself read. The book does not really deserve the rating I gave, but the characters are so great that I thought they deserved credit for showing up."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING.",Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought the hard back copy. I have been an avid Cornwell fan for years and anxiously awaited this release. Much to my dismay it was hard to pick up once I started it. Don't bother.
2,NOT WORTH THE WAIT,"Having thouroughly enjoyed Cornwell's previous works (at least the Scarpetta series), I was thrilled to get my hands on ""Precinct"". It really wasn't worth the wait. I kept waiting for some pace to develop, and for Scarpetta to emerge from the self-pity malaise. It never happened. The conspiracy was far fetched and ill developed, and the insightful forensics Cornwell's fans have come to expect were nearly non-existant. I turned the last page feeling like Grisham fans have after his last four or five...suckered"
1,"Kay Scarpetta, where are you?","From the first chapter on, I felt cheated. I kept saying (out loud to whoever would listen), ""This is not the Kay Scarpetta we know and love!"" The book comes off as a very bad sequel, and the ending is an obvious lead-in to the next sequel. I didn't like the book at all, and really only finished it in the hopes that sooner or later it'd get better. It didn't!"
4,Does the job,"The antenna inputs on my new receiver are bnc connectors. My indoor antenna system uses ""F-Type"" connector. These adapters provide a relable and good-looking match between them. I would give it a 5th star, except that the adapter is a little roughly cast and is occationally difficut to remove."
1,Right Wing Tripe,"Pendley has written a book full of tales of people who are act out of greed and self-interest. If Pendley and the people in this book had their way America would have no public land, no protected forest, and noise pollution from the many many roads they'd build thru our pristine wildernesses would destroy any wilderness experience.Pendley and the people he celebrates have a view of the future that looks forward no farther than next week. They are trying to destroy what we cherish. Because true liberty is the freedom to go where you want and experience our great country in its natural state...not whats left over after corporate interests have taken their toll."
4,Helpful College Text,I used the text in a class I taught at Cal-Berkeley in Organizational Management. It highighted an important dynamic in the modern workplace.
2,Lengthy and slow paced!,"If you are sure of what you want when you pick up this book, I recommend that you skip the first 72 pages as these pages only describe the different political behaviour.Page 73 to 106 provide guidance on how to view politics in the positive light, and the signs to watch out for in your environment.Page 107 to 167 provide information on how to manage your image in the company and how to verbalise your thoughts to your overly political colleagues.Reading in progress"
5,Excellent A&E Biography Of Tony Randall!!,"This video biography of Tony Randall is excellent from his childhood in Oklahoma to his rich movie,theater career.Although he is probably best known from the TV series""The Odd Couple"",he has acted in so many wonderful movies and theatrical productions.You can sometimes spot him on the David Letterman Show begging to become a guest.This is a video well worth watching as a historical account of a Superb and Wonderful Actor Tony Randall.We Love You!!"
5,excellent DVD,"I purchased this DVD mainly as a snorkeler wanting to view more underwater critters. I was not disappointed. I've had many interactions with reef squid, which are similar to cuttlefish. The film presented some amazing footage of cuttlefish. It showed scientists demonstrating how the cuttlefish are actually quick learners and amazingly smart for a water critter. When I snorkel with reef squid, I have always thought they were more intelligent than other sea life just because of the way they watched us. At times I wasn't sure who was being watched more, us or them. This film confirmed that the squids and cuttlefish are much more interesting than we'd originally thought. Worth the purchase for sure."
2,Keep It Charged!,"This vacuum works fairly well when fully charged but it does not keep a charge for very long at all. 20 minutes of run time is a stretch---my Euro-Pro Shark has routinely died after only 10 minutes of use. To make matters worse, since the manufacturer recommends you let the vacuum fully discharge before re-charging (requires overnight charge), you're always left wondering how much time you have left before it shuts-off. I also found that the cone filter clogs very fast and the housing it is in is difficult to remove in order to clean the filter. Not what I would expect from a [$] hand-vac."
1,Do not spend money on this garbage!,"For all it's supposed power, after a month of use, this vac could not pick up dry cereal of the floor. It wizzled out after 30 sec. of work. The charge light broke right away, so I could never tell whether it was charging. I kept it around for 6 month only bacause I paid good money for it, and finally threw it away hardly used. I am very disappointed in Amazon's good editorial review which prompted me to buy it. They are supposed to be objective."
1,Not a good product,"I purchased this product because I was impressed by the in-store demonstration. When I started to use it at home I was very disappointed. First, it did not fit easily into its charging stand. Many times I thought it was charging when, in fact, it was not. It does not pick up small dust and other debris well. Stuff you vacuum up falls out again when you turn it off. Cleaning the collector bin is hard since case does not fit togeather well. Over all I say, by something else."
3,Meh,"I've had this for a few years now and only used it about a year. It worked ok for picking up little spills, but those could have easily been done with a broom. It didn't work too well on carpets as it always seemed to leave a little bit behind. Frankly, I think it was a waste of money. It doesn't even work anymore as I had it stored in a closet for a few years and found it again a few weeks ago. I plugged it in to charge and the light came on, but when i went to use it the light was no longer on and it won't work at all. Its going in the garbage as I have no use for a broken hand vac."
2,The short battery life is a major problem,"I bought this vacuum for spot cleanup at home and for car interior use. When I first bought the Euro-Pro, the battery life was about 20 minutes. Now I am lucky to get 1-2 minutes of use, and based on other reviews, that seems to be the norm. Another problem is the lack of a flexible hose for hard to reach areas.The terrible battery life is a shame, because when the battery is new, the Euro-Pro has great suction for a rechargable unit. Because of that, I cannot recommend this vacuum."
1,Batteries are junk,"I bought this vacuum to use when changing my bird cages, and the battery couldn't keep the unit running long enough to get through one cage cleanup, let alone two. The battery lasts a minute, or less. And, the unit is so loud it could wake the dead. I sure wish I'd read the reviews for this useless vacuum before spending my money. I now use the DeWalt DC500 vacuum instead. The cost was about 1-1/2 times what I paid for the Shark, and I use my husband's batteries."
1,The Poles,Although the vacuum is very strong the poles keep coming apart and it is very hard to use with this feature. Great to vacuum cars out.
1,An other piece of chunk made in China.,"The first unit I bought did not charge at all and I had to send it back to be replaced under warranty. Now the replacement unit, which initially worked fine, will after a relative short time of use run only for 5 seconds and then shut off. A typical case of a nice western designed product which would work well if not Chinese inferior materials, workmanship and quality control would render it a useless piece of junk."
2,Loved it then..Hate it Now,"Loved it when it was new. Now, it has no battery power. Battery is too expensive to replace, and almost impossible to locate anyways. It lasted about two years before the battery died.Prior to the battery dying, it worked excellent though. I used it daily."
2,Ho Hum,"At my urging we purchased one of these for work to clean filters. And it works okay but like an earlier reviewer it could be better. It's certainly not as good as some purport it to be. The cordless function is nice, but the attachments would be better if they snapped into place rather than fitting snugly only to pop out occasionally while in use, which is irritating. But suction power's not too bad. On a scale of 1 to 5 for suction I'd give it a 3 or 4. It could be better but I wouldn't get this one if you plan on using it alot. For an occasional use it's okay."
1,Garbage,"Suction was only fair when brand new (struggled with crumbs, so forget about bolts or bowling balls as advertised) and even that minimal suction disappeared after 6 months. Now when fully charged, it will work for 15 seconds and then shut down. In contrast, I had a 12 year old Black & Decker Dustbuster that worked for the whole period without problems. Save your money, this thing is garbage. It doesn't deserve the one star, but this is the lowest rating Amazon allows."
1,Absolutely worthless,"The dirt cup doesn't hold enough debri, That is if you can get it to run long enough to fill it. The unit is always dead after about running it for 3 seconds. I will never buy another."
1,Battery!!!!,"How many people have to repeat that battery really drain fast?I am not going to repeat what other people have said so many times. I think I used the vacuum about less than 20 times in total. Now I can use the vacuum for about 20 seconds MAX!!!! If you are going to pick up anything, be quick and pick up that dirt within 20 seconds and recharge it again. I think they should think about sell replacement battery..... Man this product sucks..."
2,Innaccurate listing,"I will say that I do like this product and it works very well.The issue I have here is with amazon is that with this listing and multiple other Berkley dough bait listings they show two jars in the visual and the purchaser likely is thinking they will receive two jars at the listed price. You will in fact only receive 1 jar at this price which isn't a real deal by any means. If it was 2 jars for 6.99 then that's a good deal. 1 jar at this price, well you can find that anywhere and likely for a less than this listed price. If you buy it through bass pro or cabelas you get the berkley rebate which means it even cheaper. We thought that we were gonna get a good deal with this product. If it isn't too much of a pain we will probably return it and get it elsewhere."
4,Pda case works well for palm 680,"This case was bought for my husband who wears it daily. It was a little stiff when new, and took some getting used to. My husband uses a palm 680 and it fit snugly but took some skill learning to retrieve it out of the case (palms are slippery). We solved that by adding egrips to the palm. He loves the egrips and the palm still fits in the case. One of the advantages of this case is the belt loop feature. Although the case came with a clip, my husband opted for the beltloops for more security. He wears this everywhere from morning to night - driving, walking, working. The original stiffness makes the case a little resistant to closing with the snap at first. This resolved quickly over a couple of days. I would recommend this case (along with egrips) especially because of the beltloop feature. It looks very professional, good quality - not flimsy."
4,Pokemon Pikachu Edition,"My son is having so much fun with this game. He loves that his Pikachu follows him everywhere and that he can check his Pikachu's mood (ie: sad, happy). A great game."
2,Parent's opinion,"This is my opinion as a parent and it can be viewed in any way you wish. From a child's perspective, it is a great game and will keep you occupied for hours. Unfortunately for parents, this is all that the kids will talk about. Exercise your own opinion and stick with that decision."
2,242828 good,"This toy is good but the toy is almost kind of hard to beat. So,If your good I would recomond to you! Bye."
1,Gah this game is worth your time,Don't get me wrong. I am a pokemon gamer but this game is way to hard! Making you start with a pikachu is sort of ok but it gets annoying hearing the little nag screeching all the time. i always found pikachus annoying. and then i have to rasise a stupid caterpie to defeat brock! i got this game to see jesse and james and so far i havn't seen them. this game is too hard i reccomend pokemon red and blue instead!
4,"It's a sister game, get that straight.","It's similar to Crystal, Emerald, and Platinum. They're all sister games. They're extensions of the other two in their generation, the same game with stuff added.However, this is still a great game. You start with a Pikachu, and you cannot evolve it. However, you can obtain the other three starters. Your rival Green owns a Eeeve.This game is based off the anime. However, your character ""Red"" is not Ash/Satoshi, and your rival ""Blue"" (Green in Japan and NA games after the second generation) is not Gary. Still, expect many similar things, such as Nurse Joys."
4,It's an okay game,"Pokemon Yellow Version is kind of better than Red and Blue Version. It is, however, mainly the same, such as the story, what happens in the game, and what you are to do. The newest things are that Pikachu follows you and that the pictures of the pokemon have changed. I would have given it 5 stars, but the story and options are the same as Red and Blue Version."
4,WWAAAAAHHHH!!!,"This thing is now a hard-to-find item!But it is great!It's not as wonderful as the classics, red and blue, but it's a fun rpg.Warning! You will need to trade with both red and blue to get all 150 catchable pokemon available! But there is a surfing pikachu mimigame if you have a surfing pikachu, of course, i suggest using gameshark for that! Anyways, if you can get it, have fun!"
4,Review,"I give this game 4 stars because once you have played it awhile, it gets kind of old.But it's fun when you haven't played it fora long time.I think it's pretty cool."
3,Not all floppy discs will work,"Ordered this product so I could use a floppy disc that I was able to pull up and do revisions on my computer at work. Unfortunately this Floppy Disc Drive indicated that the disc was empty, so I was unable to use this product. Fortunately for my husband, he was able to use it with some of his floppy discs."
1,"Wow, THAT Much?","My father needed a 3.5"" drive to recover some old files on floppy disk.Why did this thing have to cost more than a spindle of DVD-R's?Because its medium can hold over 1.4MB of data! That's almost 1/500th as much as a CD-R!!!Don't get one of these unless you really need to...let the old tech rest in peace."
5,JUST AS I HOPED IT WOULD BE!,"I recently purchased a Sabrent SBT-UFDB USB External 3.5 inch Floppy Disk Drive for my new Dell Computer. As you are well aware most, if not all, new computer systems do not include a 3.5 inch disk drive anymore. I have hundreds of 3.5 inch floppy disks with vital information on them that I need to access in my profession as a Pastor. This particular unit is just what I needed to get the job done. All I had to do was plug it into my computer's USB port and away I went. I experienced absolutely no problems with its installation, just plug it in and its done. I am not a computer savy person so I needed a fool proof system that works all the time. This 3.5 inch disk drive provided me access to my data and I can now use the files that I spent hours preparing before the technology changed. I highly recommend this item for other computer confounded persons like myself. Reverend George R. Sanderson M.S., MSRC, MSW."
4,Sabrent External Floppy Drive,Device runs a bit slow but that's how floppies work. I like the convenience of being able to switch to another computer.
2,DOA,"product did not work when i received it.Will not format disks and requires multiple attempts for reading and writing to disk. Returning product with intention of buying a different brand as this drive seems cheaply made, would perfer to spend the extra $10 on a hopefully more quality product."
3,rating floppy disk devic device,A fine unit but when I use it the picture is upside down. Have to go to several steps to right it.
1,Mac users don't purchase,"This product would not work on any of the 3 Mac computers we have in the house. However, the return process was easy."
4,External floppy drive,This unit functions as it was described. I am completely satisfied with it. I would recommend this unit to a friend.
1,Sony xl2200 replacement bulb is a DUD!,Save your money and buy an actual Phillips bulb! This one was $40 and lasted less than 1 month! Will never buy one of these again! Bought a Phillips one before and it lasted almost 2 years! I had to order another bulb and I spent the extra and just bought the Phillips one! Very disappointed in this product!!
2,Lasted only 2 years so it gets 2 stars!,"This lamp only lasted 2 years. And after about 13-14 months, the picture brightness suffered and screen seemed to get darker as every day went by. So, as it held up almost 2 years, I give this product 2 strong stars!!"
1,Bad bulb,"It blew up in 7 months, one month after the six month warranty. It is not worth the money. Buy a name brand."
1,Terrible Customer service,"I PURCHASE THIS ITEM ON THE 7TH OF JULY, NOW ON THE 12TH I RECEIVE AN E-MAIL STATING THEY ARE UNABLE TO SHIP MY PRODUCT DO TO DEMAND PROBLEMS. YET HERE I AM ON THE SITE AGAIN AND IT SHOW 17 AVAILABLE!I FIND THIS TO BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. THE ONLY REASON I CHOSE TO GO THROUGH AMAZON (WHICH WAS NOT THE LOWEST PRICE) WAS DO TO THE FACT I HAVE DONE A LOT OF SHOPPING ON THERE WEBSITE BEFORE WITH LITTLE IF ANY PROBLEMS.GUESS I AM GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT IS TRULY COMING FROM AMAZON FROM NOW ON, AND NOT A VENDER THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO WORK WITH ON THERE SITE!Sony XL-2200 - LCD projector lamp"
4,"It works, just not as long as the original","I bought this in June of 2011, went bad just before Christmas 2012... Paid $90 then, now its $40...No quality problems. Good replacement lamp.The original lasted for 4+ years. This lasted a year and a half."
5,"excellent product, great price","product priced great and received timely, exactly what I expected. I would definitely order from this company again."
4,GREAT VOICE AND GREAT SONGS,His voice has always been strong and these are great songs. Have always loved him and he is still alive and singing!
3,"Not bad, but nothing great","My mom really likes the song ""Bop,"" and mentioned that she'd like to hear more of Dan Seals' music. I got her the CD for Christmas and she's listened to it several times by now. It seems like many of the songs are fairly slow and sound a bit alike. The songs are not bad or poorly sung, just not very memorable. I wish now I listened to the CD before I bought it to see if it was to my mom's taste in country music."
3,source for replacement bags and filters,Replacement bags and filters can be ordered from chefscatalog.com.
1,Another Angry Customer With Dirty Floors,"I ordered in April, 03. Like other reviewers, my vacuum failed almost immediately. My diagnosis -- a short-circuit in the motor (if I'm right, a major quality control no-no). Sending good money after bad, I returned the vacuum according to the warranty instructions, including a check for $9.95 (why should I pay them for fixing their bad product? -- Go figure). I paid postage and insurance for the package. I also bought like $50 in vacuum bags before the vacuum failed. Now I've practically paid for a new vacuum. They never responded. All I have to show for it is a bunch of bags. The good news -- they didn't cash my check!Why is Amazon still carrying this product?"
3,Great Story on Puccini,"I really likes the story. The acting was pretty good for its time. It would be great if they made a remake of it. You can tell it was a sort of low budget. I was pleased with the accuracy of the story. Be sure to get out your kleenex and have all your music from Puccini ready cause you'll want to listen to ""Nessun Dorma"" right off!"
5,Great Running Energy,These are great for distance runners who need fuel mid run. I take a pack for any distance over 7 miles.
5,Great bloks!,"I love the texture and the way you actually have bites. Gels for me are a tad more difficult, and I have to eat a pack of gel over several miles and that can get a little messy (if I don't my tummy will start hurting). So these Cliff Bloks really are great- bite sized, easy to chew, tasty & you don't have to eat them all at once. Love these! And the ones with caffeine too!!"
4,Much better than Gu!,"Training for a 1/2 marathon and I knew I needed some energy replenishment so I got some Gu. Tried it on one of my runs and nearly vomited! How people can use that stuff is beyond me. Anyway I tried the Shot Bloks instead and no problem! They have a jelly baby consistency plus they are not too sweet! They go down great during a run, with a little water as per the directions.The only downside to these (and reason for 4 stars not 5) is that the packaging is terrible. People wanting these are going to be doing strenuous activity, running, cycling etc and these packages are awful to open! I fixed this by cutting the end off before runs and cling wrap the end. Terrible design by Clif for this packaging :(This cran/razz is my favorite flavor :)"
5,Yummy,"These are tasty, and I like that they added sodium for my long runs/rides. This price is right, as well.I like the Bloks (they are like gummies) better than the gels, as the gels tend to make me gag when I am working out."
4,Good.,In a few short words: Very easy. Kinda chewy. Sufficient energy. More enjoyable than goo by far. I definitely recommend.
2,Dangerous toy for little children,"Please be ware that the wheels can come off these cars and pose a choking hazzard to little children. While my then three-year old son was playing with the toy, two of the wheels fell off one of the cars. Within seconds, my 1-year old daughter grabbed a wheel and put it in her mouth. Had I not been watching, she easily could have swallowed or inhaled this wheel which can look like candy or large Cheerios to young children! We put the toy away and will not take it out until our children are all above the age of 4."
2,horrible craftsmanship!!!!,"First of all, there is no standard to the size of the wheel widths - they have to be short enough to go in between the wooden bars and out of 8 wheel shafts, only one was the right size. 95% of the time you let a car go at the top, it gets stuck or just falls off the track. We had to saw off a portion of each wheel to make them the correct size to go down & even then sometimes they fall of the edge where they should just flip down to the next level. I paid $40 for this toy, & I would not buy it again. The homemade fix was time consuming & it's still not perfect. There are better options for this type of toy - haba has a great ball track, although it is much more expensive & aimed at a younger crowd. Find a better toy, this one stinks!"
1,Does not contain power cord,"I expected to get a charger. Instead I got a dock that works with a charger. If you don't have a power cord for your DS, this does not give you a way to charge the DS."
2,Filter nightmare,"Well so much for a vacuum with a lot of power, it does not have any if you do not clean the filter every time you vacuum four room house and no power of suction on carpet if you do thoses at last. Well not a good buy to my taste and by the way I am still looking for replacement filters...."
1,Not the complete album.,"Why does your MP3 version only have nine tracks?? The original has 12, as does the one sold on iTunes. I'm not buying it unless I can get the complete album. Furthermore, you don't even list it as a partial album."
1,The book has no coherence.,"I am a Christian and appreciate all the good quotes and God loving of the book, but he just doesn't keep the reader interested. He talks about one thing or person and then jumps to another without finishing his original thought."
2,Feels great! Breaks quick.,"This is the OEM starter pedals that come with road bikes to ""get you by"" until you purchase cycling shoes. However, there is an alloy core model of this available that does work quite well.This particular plastic/resin core model has the steel cages screwed on, and since the screws go into plastic, and you're stepping on this, you can just imagine how that goes.The purpose of this particular product is for selling bikes, test drives and other temporary use."
3,Not Amy's Best for Women's Health,"I have Amy's other two videos for Women's Health and really like them. They're fun and challenging and Amy's not annoying like other fitness guides. Her talking is to give instruction, not to yell at you like Gillian Michaels.However, this video is both waaay easier (even though it's longer) and waaay more confusing than her other videos. At the end I wasn't even sweating. During the cardio and strength portion she seemed determine to do as many short complicated movements as possible. You'd do eight counts on each side and then you'd never do it again. Her other videos have more plyometrics and are easier to follow, so you really get into it and burn many more calories.I'd recommend her other two. This one isn't worth it."
5,Anime Fans Would Love This One,"I was a Fuzzbox fan back when ""We've Got a Fuzzbox..."" came out in '86 (whoo! has it been that long?), so this came as a surprise to me four years later that an all-girl lo-fi punk band made their second album a shimmering, slick-produced dance-rock confection. It took me another year to realize that this album is, in fact, a brilliant attempt at the music you hear in Japanese animation (anime), intentional or not. There are a lot of great tracks on here (Fast Forward Futurama, Versatile for Discos and Parties), an interesting cover (Yoko Ono's 'Walking on Thin Ice') and an homage to the old animatronic classic 'Thunderbirds' (International Rescue). The only dud on here is a forced 'Irish Bride'. Highly suggested."
2,H20 GLOW,"IT IS THE COOLEST THING, TOO BAD IT DOESN'T FIT ON ANY SINK! NOW WHAT? OH WELL. FAILED PURCHASE."
5,the nightlight surprise?,"One night I stumbled in the dark kitchen for a glass of water. I was half asleep and didn't turn on the overhead light. I turned the water faucet on and a beam of blue light lit up the room. At first it startled me, since I wasn't expecting it, then I was glad I wouldn't have to turn on a brighter light to find a glass. I didn't have to put my hand in the stream to see if it was the right temperature.This is a great product that does what it claims to do. It was simple to install. The instructions were easy. I didn't have to worry about anything being too delicate that it might break. I am recommending it to my friends and family. It is still a surprise to hear friends say ""wow, what's this?"" when they turn the water on. That is quickly followed by ""how do I get one?"""
1,Do not bother with this book,"Hello all,I found this book very incomplete and also lacking any serious depth. You have to ask if the author actually understands FW-1."
2,Not as helpful as I had hoped,"I was hoping this book would help me learn to be a calmer, more patient, and contented parent. While there were lots of examples, I felt this book was rambling and didn't really give me practical help."
2,Disappointing,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed, ""Wherever You Go, There You Are,"" I was excited to read ""Everyday Blessings"". I could not have been more disappointed. As a parent, I was looking for concrete examples of mindful parenting. The book felt preachy and at times, condescending. There are other books out there that are much more helpful if you are looking for techniques to improve your parenting, such as ""Buddhism For Mothers"" (great for Dads too!)."
3,A forgettable Doris Day film except for...,There is only one reason I remember this movie. At a big party scene Paul Lynde is dressed up as a woman -- to uncover a spy in their midst. He looks at the bar and-- to the wailing horns of Jerry Goldsmith's first season theme to THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. -- there stands a tux clad Robert Vaughn (presumably as Napoleon Solo). He looks away and when he looks back Vaughn is gone. I can't think of another thing to recommend this movie unless you are really rabid Doris Day or Rod Taylor fan.
5,The Glass Bottom Boat,"This is such a good movie, and pure clean FUN, something we don't see much of in movies of today! I love the ""cake"" scene and Doris Day is funny in just about every movie I've seen. There is a ""LADY FROM THE WILDS OF WISCONSIN"" who wrote a review and mentioned a movie with Chuck Connors and Doris Day being stranded on an island with him and returned home to find her husband remarried. but she couldn't remember the name of that movie.......well hopefully,she'll read this because I have that movie. It is ""Move Over Darling"" and also stars James Garner as the husband and Polly Bergen as the new wife. I have many Doris Day movies......I love comedy and she is certainly A-one in my book. I am middle-age and I enjoy the classics.....when movies were really movies!"
5,Glass Bottom Boa,This is a great movie and the order arrived before it said it would. Great mail service and I would order from them anytime. Five stars to the movie and the seller.
5,Cool !!,My children and I have a really fun time using this item...it is SO helpful for them when they have math homework and is a lot more fun than using a boring old calculator !
5,Fun & Colorful Counting,This abacus has been loads of fun for my two year old who is just learning the counting basics. She loves to just sit and play with the beads or to count with the help of mom and dad. The wood and metal construction is very safe and durable like all Melissa and Doug toys. This will be a useful and fun learning tool for years to come.
5,Abacus,This was purchased for our two year old granddaughter for Christmas and she really liked the bright colors. She really enjoys playing with it.
3,Not as good as I thought,"I heard so many good things about this product before purchasing it, but I didnt notice any difference in my hair after using it. I am glad I only bought a small bottle. Its usually best to buy a small bottle before investing more money in a product youre not sure of : )"
2,Buy the real thing,"These ""tribute"" albums are no doubt intended as a compliment, but they usually do a disservice to the honored songwriter. This is especially true on this set, because Richard Thompson is a greater and more unique performer than arguably anyone who covers his songs here. Despite their punk roots, X and Bob Mould don't rock any harder than RT did on the originals of the songs they covered. The various folkies on the album have nothing on Richard, Linda Thompson, or Sandy Denny when it comes to great ballad singing. And so on...Be glad it's out of stock. Treat yourself to the real thing."
1,It destroyed my iPod!,"This is the worst product I have ever used! At the first time using, it explored when I unplugged it from the outlet and destroyed my ipod!"
3,it works ( on both iTouch 2nd Generation & Blackberry curve)...,"I would've preferred if they had the foldable plug points, but I should consider myself lucky that it works."
5,Bad boys make me smile.,"Can you see my smile from where you are? I have been searching for anything from the Pistons repeat years and all I ever seem to find are games where the Lakers or the Bulls are beating them. I was grateful enough but a bit annoyed. So you can imagine how excited I was to find this box set from the 88-89 season. Very reasonably priced and the quality is very good considering it must have been transfered form old video tapes. Disc 11 is an overview of the entire season and is worth the price just on it's own. Now, all I need is the '89-90 season. Come on you old Pistons fans start making some noise and get this season on to disc before I get to be too old to enjoy it.spider from Down Under."
1,They just fell apart,"Consumer Reports is right. I, too, ran control tests. My positive test - with 40% lead solder, showed a faint dusky color. Anything I test in my house is bound to have a lower than 40% lead level, so I am already dealing with a difficult test to interpret. But that never happened, because the tests all fell apart before the 2 minute rubbing time was over. I scraped through the layers of paint on my floor, just as the directions said. I took one of the miniscule tests and rubbed as gently as I could. The paper rolled and disintigrated as though that were what it was created to do. This was the end result for every single test on every object I tried except the smooth solder. That test stayed intact. These tests were of such poor quality I would have had a hard time trusting them even if I had ever had a test left to read in the end."
5,A good part,This is identical to the OEM Bosch component installed in the 1997 Subaru Outback. The connector is for the rear catalytic converter in the exhaust system.
5,Great Reproduction,"I've been doing some research on Whitman, and this is one of those books that originally had a pretty short print run so is hard to find and if you do find it, costs a small fortune. So I was quite pleased to find that BiblioBazaar brought it back into print, and at a reasonable price at that!"
2,"I already did review it, pay attention","i already did review it, pay attention. I already did review it, pay attention. doesn't anyone ever look at these reviews."
2,Not the greatest program,"I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids. I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this ""fun"" DVD. He was 7 at the time. This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video. It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans. At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand. I am just glad I only borrowed this from our library, rather than wasting money on it."
3,Unsubstantial,They are as basic as can be with no heel and very thin leather. There's no substance or structure to the leather and I think overpriced for the quality.
4,"Hard to find, and I love them.","These are great shoes. They are comfortable, cute and stylish. The Hepburn style is more difficult to find than I thought they would be. Amazons price was great. I love them."
3,Tastes good but separates out,"I read various reviews and plumped for this brand. It tastes as I had expected, but unless you drink it all quickly, the mixture separates out and you need to shake it back together, and it still has a granular texture to it, not smooth like I had hoped. Anyone recommend a better one?"
5,The Voyage of the Frog review,The Voyage of the FrogBy Gary PaulsonThe Voyage of the Frog is an exciting thriller book. The reader is not sure what is going to happen next. At the beginning of the book the boy named David goes out to sea. He hits a storm. Is David going to make it? If you like thrills I recommend this book for you!
1,Steam Is Not Vapor,"This product is not exactly what I was looking for. I own a small neighborhood meat market. I had heard that there was a new product on the market that cleans and sanitizes using only water...and I was looking for such a machine to clean my cutting boards, counter tops, and other equipment that comes in daily contact with raw meat and raw poultry products. Hot water and soap is okay but does not kill all the bacteria. Bleach water disinfects but its frequent use wears down and discolors my equipment. So I thought I found the solution with steam. Unfortunately, I confused steam with vapor. I recently came across a great review at [website] that points out the differences. I highly recommend that you read it before you by this product: [website]"
5,Product exactly what the doctor ordered,The product was delivered in a timely fashion and in excellent condition. I recommend this provider and Amazon.com.
5,This Worked Great For Me :),"I recently starting taking this do to alot of stress coming from outside my home; I was feeling anxious, moody and finding it difficult to sleep. after reading all the positive reviews on amazon i ordered it. i just started taking it due to soo much stress here now lately and this is great stuff!!! i feel amazing again and am handling my stress much better and am sleeping at night. i will be ordering this again and taking it whenever i feel so bad again."
2,Did not help...,Ordered and it was delivered all the way to middle east surprisingly fast. I had hoped it would help me sleep while I'm deployed and it has not. I ordered melatonin from the same company because that was recommended to me by someone here... so we'll we how that goes when it gets here!
4,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Researched many products for a sleep aide, visited the organics / Nutritional stores as well and every road lead to this product. We are using it with success and have even reordered. No ""after effects"" the next morning - just getting a more restful night INSTEAD of waking up around 2-3 am and having difficulty falling back to sleep."
5,Stunned,"I have been on many many different prescription medicaitons for depression and anxiety. I really hated all the side effects so decided to do more research. I am very impressed with L-Tryptophan. I can tell a remarkable differnece in my mood and anxiety. No real difference in my sleep, but I am definately feeling much better and less anxious about the stress in my life. I am so thankful I found this stuff. It took about three weeks to truly see the difference. I am much less irritable and much more happy."
3,"tablets, not capsules (it's mislabled)","Acceptable product, works as well as any other brand I've used. But it is not capsules, it is tablets. Tablets are compressed powder, hard and crunchy to chew. If you like to dissolve capsules under your tongue, this is not the product to buy. Capsules can be dissolved for quicker onset, or if you want to take another dose during the night."
1,Garbage,"My husband gave me this cookbook for Christmas a few years ago. I was very disappointed after looking at a few recipes and trying a couple others. These recipes don't work.I have been cooking and baking for many many years. Just looking at the recipes I knew the amounts were wrong (wrong rising agent for the amount of acid in the recipe, wrong porportion of liquid to dry ingredients, etc.), but I tried a couple anyhow. Total flop. The muffins were garbage and the cookies didn't taste good either.I can't figure out how so many people like this book. Pick any other standard cookbook before this one!"
2,How to UNDERCOOK Everything,"After using this book throughout my first year of marriage, I can easily say that it's a decent, thoughtful cookbook. However, every recipe without fail has underestimated the cooking time by no less than half.It's fine once you get used to it. But, it's a major failing that has messed up more than one evening. Even if you're trying out a recipe for the first time, who wants to eat two hours late?Forewarned is forearmed."
4,A kitchen essential--but not for the recipes.,"Before Bittman came out with How to Cook Everything Vegetarian, I picked up this book as an all-around reference. And it is a great reference! While none of the recipes have completely knocked my socks off, it's a great tool for ideas on how to cook new foods, and a great starting point for trying new recipes/techniques. Bittman offers detailed information and advice on nearly every food/cuisine/technique imaginable!"
4,"""How to Cook Everything"", Mark Bittman","This is the best all around cookbook I've ever used. I've had one for years, so I bought this copy for my daughter. I was disappointed to discover, upon arrival, that I had purchased a paperback; I could have sworn the site stated hardback."
1,dull as a dictionary,"yes, it's a good reference book but the meals are just ordinary- perhaps meals you would find at swiss chalet for example- julia child and jacques pepin's new book is excellent by comparison-"
4,Cook Book,I love this book. I didn't have a mother to teach me about cooking so I didn't understand a lot of the terminology. This book explains everything and most of it is simple. These meal are really tasty! I am finally having some fun cooking.Shawn
1,It self-destructs,"A great cookbook for today. However, I am now buying my 3rd copy because the binding keeps falling apart.Just a disgusting practice. Shame on them."
4,Great choice for cooks of all experience levels,"Finally, I found someone who shares's my philosophy of cooking. You can create nutritious, tasty meals without resorting to ""convenience foods"" or ingredients not found in rural America's supermarkets. The recipes rely on fresh ingredients and mastering basic cooking techniques. His writing style is also interesting. This cookbook is quite comprehensive; however, even with 1500 recipes some regional favorites seem to be left out. This book is an excellent choice for the new home cook or as a reference for more experienced cooks. However, if you think the microwave is the most important invention of the 20th Century and home cooking is assembling canned and precooked foods, you are apt not to agree with Bittman's philosophy. I've been cooking for many years and have reviewed several all-purpose cookbooks before settling on this one."
1,But nothing...,It was intended to be a book about how to cook EVERYTHING...but nothing I wanted to cook or eat.
1,There's better book than this one. Not Worth the $$$$$,"Lousy recipes, little guidance. I don't know why I bought this cheap, retarded cook book. It doesn't show you how to cook anything. I couldn't find anything I like to cook or want to eat in this book."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I realize that this book has a lot of fans, but I honestly can't understand it. Maybe it's the recipes that I've chosen, but over the years pretty much all the recipes I've tried in this cookbook are mediocre at best. Everything from mac-n-cheese to pumpkin bread were just... not quite right or tasteless. I've cooked professionally so I'm not a beginner. I've had more success with recipes found on cooking Web sites where the recipes are user submitted."
5,wonderful collection of essays,"One of my favorite books - it has a eclectic, rich, and well-thought collection of the greatest essays from the classical to the modern era. Entertaining and meditative at the same time."
4,"A misnomer, but not bad ...","""Great Move"" is a bad move if you're looking for the definite collection of the Brit pop group. None of their early singles are here -- actually, nothing before 1970 is here.""Great Move!"" should have instead been subtitled ""The Jeff Lynne Years,"" as it covers the last album the band did with Lynne (Message from the Country) and three strong singles -- ""Tonight,"" ""Chinatown,"" and the original version of the classic ""Do Ya."" ELO fans should hunt this out as a primer to Lynne/Wood's later orchestral stuff (which they were working on simultaneously to all of this); Move fans should seek this out for the great singles (and bonus tracks) at the end to round out the band's history. Throw this in with the ""Movements"" box set by Westside Records, and you've got the Move from start to finish."
2,Strong Projects- Weak Instruction,"I bought this book solely to build the adirondack chair which I recently finished. Lots of Cut List info makes buying the lumber easy. However, once into a project the pictures/illustrations and descriptions of precise placement of key parts leaves much to be desired. I have built several other chairs from different plans and based on this experience, I sadly cannot recommend this book."
1,No way - don't buy it,"Adirondack chair plan doesn't give sufficient information. After I cut all of the wood as instructed, found out that there are no measurements given for placement of key parts. Obviously this book was never shop tested. Do not buy this book."
5,Great Plug Cutter,"This plug cutter cuts a 5/8 inch plug to a perfect 5/8 inch OD. The plug is approximately 1 1/4 inch long.I purchased this at Amazon.Irwin 43910 5/8"" Plug Cutter"
3,Did not get rid of bumps; Good disinfectant,"I purchased PFB Vanish thinking that it would get rid of my razor bumps but it did not. I'm a black male and I get bad razor bumps after I shave. PFB Vanish came highly recommended by a skin care specialist, however, it doesn't work for me. On a positive note, PFB Vanish feels good after a shave because it disinfects without drying up your skin."
4,DEEP WELL!!!!!,"Image's presentation of ""The Well"" uses a rather well-worn print. It's entirely watchable, but suffers from 2 vertical white lines during much of the film. There is also one splice where a few words of dialogue are missing. No extras. The case cover art is idiotic."
3,THE WELL-STILL ENTERTAINING,"I ORIGINALLY SAW THIS MOVIE IN 1958 WHEN I WAS 5 YEARS OLD. TOTHIS DAY I REMEMBERED IT AS RIVETING.I NEVER FORGOT THE IMAGE OFTHE WELL DRILLING EQUIPMENT TOWERING ABOVE THE WELL.UPON REWATCHING"" THE WELL"" I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED HOW DATED IT WAS.THE CHARACTERS USE EXCESSIVE FACIAL EXPRESSION AND ESSENTIALLY OVER ACT TO DRIVE HOME DRAMATIC POINTS. UNFORTUNATELY REAL PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T ACT THAT WAY.THE PLOT CENTERS ON HOW AN AVERAGE TOWN DESCENDS INTO MOB VIOLENCE WHEN A BLACK GIRL, LAST SEEN WITH A WHITE MAN, DISAPPEARS.THE IMMEDIATE ASSUMPTION IS THAT HE'S MURDERED HER, WHEN IN FACT SHE'S FALLEN INTO AN ABANDONED WELL. THE TOWNSFOLKIMMEDIATELY BECOME MARAUDING BANDS OF CLUB WIELDING THUGS INTENT ON RACIAL GENOCIDE.OF COURSE,WHEN THE GIRL IS DISCOVERED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WELL, THE TOWN REUNITES TO SAVE HER.THESE RADICAL MOOD TRANSFORMATIONS ARE SIMPLY TOO MUCH TO BELIEVE.THE WELL IS GOODFOR ONE VIEWING,BUT IS NOTHING TO BE WATCHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
4,I want to add this to my wish list....,"...but my computer is being really stupid and won't let me. So I'll just post it here. I know that these jackets are currently unavailable, but I still want one."
4,Good start tot he Priest series,"I was a little aprehensive about this series. I wasn't sure if clerics could carry books the way mages and fighters have traditionally done. Yet, on the heals of the Rogues series I decided to give this a shot.I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun fast paced book. Granted, as others have said, the writing and editing wasn't the best - but I don't think editing mistakes is a reason to downgrade a book.The main character has a very interesting story one the easily captivates the reader, the story is gradually told throughout the first half or so of the book. The supporting characters are just as interesting.The author does a very good job of scene description and character development throughout the story. It's fairly easy to feel invested in this story.Overall, I'd receommend this book to most people. If you enjoy Forgotten Realms books I think you will most likely like this one."
4,Excellent!,I could barely put this book down! David Anthony Durham captures the passion and romance of ancient warfare/culture in a very powerful novel. The historical content is very accurate while also telling of fictional drama in hannibal's life. I would recomend this book to anybody who loves reading ancient history.
2,The style doesn't work,Several other 2 star reviews are perfect depictions of how I feel about this book. The writing style is laborious and off key. This is a gold mine of interesting material that the author makes sound rather boring. The stilted and lofty writing style makes this incredible source material available fall very flat.
3,"The powerful study of a small group of people caught up in ""Papa Doc's"" reign of fear...","As a restless wife of a South African ambassador, the mother of a whining child and the mistress of an empty shell of a man, Liz is a woman who's unlucky in love...Graham Greene's explosive novel, which mixes adultery with political turmoil in the midst of Haitian corrupt dictatorship of ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier, could hardly been filmed on that Caribbean island... It tells the story of a small group people caught up in a reign of fear...The political intrigue in exotic settings has some interest and the atmosphere is astonishingly well caught...On his own, playing the cynical hotelier who unwillingly gets involved in revolutionary activity, Burton is sensible and his scenes with Alec Guinness as a cowardly soldier of fortune and with Paul Ford and Lillian Gish as two impossibly innocent American tourist, have a fine, sharp edge..."
4,Tremendous Liz and Richard.,"This is a superb box set. I bought it primarily for the VIPs and the Comedians.All four movies are superb - the DVDs are well transferred and for anyone interested in great screen acting,they need lookno further than this box set.The phalanx of great acting talent here to support the ""Burtons"" is astonishing.From Alec Guinness and Peter Ustinov to Sandy Dennis and George Segal, with more than a special mentionfor Margaret Rutherford,who steals the movie(VIPs) and won an academy award for her efforts.Tremendous Value for money."
4,THE COMEDIANS,"I LOVED THIS FILM BECAUSE IT IS PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE WITH A PORTRAL OF THE BRUTALITY OF THE ""PAPA DOC"" ERA IN HAITI.IT WAS THE START OF THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND RICHARD BURTON AND YOU WILL SEE THE ATTRACTION BEFORE FILMING OF CLEOPATRA. A HATIAN FRIEND OF MINE SAYS THE VOO-DOO IS AUTHENTIC BUT HAD TO BE DONE IN AFRICA DUE TO GOVERNMENT OBJECTION. SUSPENSE, ROMANCE, INTRIG, IS ALL HERE."
3,Tradegy vs Comedy,"i kept thinking I was watching the wrong titled film given the horrific nature and deplorable depiction of a sorrowful country... my first appreciation of Haiti was portrayed via the recent earthquake and had no idea the Doc D dictatorship paved the way to further deterioration and dire poverty... USA wants to save everyone from communism but do not recall much intervention to save these poor people from such a tragic existence... comedians???? I can't think of a more perverse term to use for a film title, no humor in this drama, except perhaps Alec's reference to Lawrence of Arabia or was it the Scarlet Pimpernel and his admission as a complete fraud, end of non-stop laughter... the cast was incredible and the TonTon's menacing.... the Liz/Burton affair seemed so inappropriate as a focal point given the country's impoverished abused populace... recommend for Haiti history, James Earl Jones, poverty education and priorities of dictatorships."
2,"Not useful, not well written","There is little to recommend this book now that there are more English language books available on chi gong.The author's discussion on the conceptual aspects of chi gung are particularly confusing, meandering and poorly reasoned.There is some limited discussion of different types of chi gung and some limited discussion of how to practice chi gung. The practice material is insufficiently detailed or clear to be of much use. There are far more useful books available today about learning chi gung.Apart from a few interesting stories about specific chi gung masters there is very little value to be found in this book."
3,Was it old or second hand?,"I have always purchased this in a Department Store. The cellophane wrapper wasn't sealed in the usual tight way. The perfume doesn't quite have the scent I'm used to, its either old, or lost some of its original good scent in the 'process',since it wasn't sealed the way I'm used to, I have to wonder, I won't order this through Amazon again."
2,Not Very Happy,"I ordered two (2) 3.4 Oz. Paloma Picasso but the wrong size 1.7 Oz. was shipped and received. I contacted your company but they said they could not ship the correct size until I return the wrong order that was shipped. I asked your company to just ship me the correct order in the meantime, that it was your mistake not mine and that you had my money. They said they could not and I would have to wait on a refund (that would take about 6-weeks) I really got upset and told them that it did not take them but 1 1/2 days to take it out of my account and that it better not take them 6 weeks to get it back into my account. Had to return the wrong products shipped and received my refund promptly after your company received their products back. I had told them to just ship me the correct product order and they said they could not that I would have to get the refund.Ordered from ebay!"
1,Stinky On Me,"I smelled Paloma Picasso on someone else and it was wonderful, so I ordered it for myself. It doesn't smell so good on me. I should have tried it out before I actually bought it."
5,Just as Pictured,"A very high quality and easy to use product. Can't verify the performance since we hope to never use it, well worth the money for the protection it offers for me and my wife's car."
2,Satisfactory product,"I was surprise to see that the item was made in Netherland. On inspection the item seem to be well made, but upon taking it apart, I find the construction of it to be just satisfactory. The handle part is hollow, leaving it vulnerable to breaking. It did not come with any mounting hardware, which was a major disappointment. I subtracted one star for the construction, one star for the lack of mounting hardware, and 1 star for the price versus quality."
2,Does not do Windshields and Wimpy,"Disappointed at just how light weight this hammer is. No heft to it as though it came out of a kiddy play tools set.Shocked when I read the material provided and learned it does not work on windshields.Just think upside down in a gully, both doors squeezed by dirt and the only window for escape is the windshield...I am putting them in the wife and my car but am definitely looking to replace them with something of substance at the earliest. This is not a product that gives me a sense of security for an emergency situation. I tied a micro light to the handle and taped it in place, so I now have a wrist strap and light. There was no tie down location on the Life Hammer for this. The blade did cut one inch climbing webbing under tension. It may actually work on a side window. I am going to a junk yard to find out for sure.Bottom line - I want a hammer I can break a windshield with and then bang bent metal out of the way and the life hammer is not a tool for that job."
3,Buyer Beware,"Aftter purchasing several for my family for their safety, saw a news report that they dont and WILL NOT BREAK GLASS. Due to new safety guidelines for cars - all car manufacturers have made the glass in all vehicles unbreakable to protect the passenger - they tested all types of these escape hammers as well as the smaller push button impact and neither the windshield, sunroof or side glass would break. So dont drive off into a canal or water because hammer will not work!"
2,If I had known before I wouldn't have bought it,"Uncorrect desciption. There are just 10 pages of which just 5 of pure biography. The others are just bibliography.If you already have basic information about Salinger's life and work, save your money and don't buy this ""e-book""!"
4,Still Relevant...,"Now that the bottom of postmodernism has actually fallen out and is being dragged along the street by the chains of American capitalism, it's ""alright"" for students of architecture to return to that misjudged canonical textbook of post-modernism, C+C by Venturi. While not as engaging as his other main work ""Learning from Las Vegas"", this book still leads the reader into a meticulous analysis of the physical composition of major pieces of architecture, and the composition of the thoughts that made them. After reading it, I found myself unconciously applying it's main dichtomy of complexity and contradiction to much of the architecture around me, if that is any testament to its power."
4,Good recipe book,"Being a Jamaican I was a bit sceptical about this book being written by foreigners (AKA non-Jamaicans), but you know this is a good overall recipe book. They did not try to tweak recipes or 'improve' upon them, but rather collected recipes from authentic Jamaican cooks. The pictures are very nice also. They have good recipes for patties, gizzadas, rice and peas and many more. I got this in high school knowing that I would one day have to move out of my parents house and cook on my own...now I'm married with 3 kids and still love this book...great for beginners or experienced cooks!"
3,"Not bad, not great","It took me a bit of time to get into this book, as the author has a tendency to get a bit wordy and extensive on some less than critical descriptions at the beginning, but after a while, I started to feel closer to the characters and get more into the story. Once the story really gets going, the action picks up and you begin to get drawn in much more. I will agree with other reviewers that Joe and Cleo the pig are the most interested characters in the book. While this was not the best Karen Robards novel I've read, it was still good enough to keep me going through to the end and feel basically satisfied."
2,Disappointing read.,"This book was so mediocre, it's hard to know where to start. The female protangantist wasn't quite likable. At times, she seemed too stupid to live. She's a journalist who broadcasts all the police leads that she comes across (even though this comprises the investigation of a serial killer) under the guise of ""if I don't report it someone else will"" - I believe this lack of morals is why everyone is disgusted with the media today. The ending was surprising - I was clearly surprised that all the loose ends would be so unbelievably tied up. Below par for Miss Robards."
2,California Muzak,"Alas,this CD is no sunshine pop masterpiece since the sun rarely shines in elevators.Bland with really undistinguished vocals,it is no surprise that the Cousins never really took off.I had hoped for better since I have fond memories of Tina Cole from television.For those of you who share those memories,you'd be better off searching for those old ""My Three Sons""shows than investing in this CD.Sorry,Tina."
5,"A good CD to add to your collection, or to begin one","I have been fascinated with Edith Piaf ever since I learned about her in my French class. ""Milord"" and ""L'amore, la vie"" are two of my favorites; they're such uplifting songs to sing! The only thing missing from this CD, IMO, was ""Mon legionnaire."" Like another reviewer said, you don't have to know French to enjoy this CD-- her message of life and love spans languages. Piaf is a wonderful facet of the French culture."
1,Excellent Album Cover!,"I really wanted to like this CD, but it really is dull. I recommend any of their other albums for the casual listener (of which I am...obviously) and leave this one for die-hard fans only. My favorite thing about ""She Hangs Brightly"" is the cover art--very creepy."
4,Crush aluminum cans safely and easily.,"I have no problem crushing aluminum drink cans with my hands. I have come very close to cutting them on sharp edges where thin cans may rip open when I do. This tool allows me to safely crush them without having to worry about cutting myself. It still takes a bit of effort to crush, but now even my wife can crush them too."
3,Average Offering From Cristopher Cross,This is Christopher Cross at his mellowest. It is an album that has to grow on you and will be enjoyed by fans of mellow singer/songwriter music. If you don't like playing albums many times to absorb them and find the hooks then pick up his debut. That one is instantly accessible and a classic album in general. This one finds Cross at his most average. Choose his Greatest hits instead if you are just a casual fan.
5,Crime of the last century if you don't own this album.,"If you are a fan of the 70's, you need this album. If you don't own any Supertramp, this is the one to get. From the opening harmonica in 'School' to the closing harmonica in 'Crime of The Century', this 16-track set is just mind-blowing. Why? So many textures working magically together to create rich musical patterns. Even if this was a studio album, the production/arrangements would be classed as awesome. Consider that it is live, and that there are only 5 musicians (not 30 as it sometimes sounds), it has got to be just bloody brilliant! ""Do yourself a favour!"" Close the blinds - dim the lights - sit in your comfy chair - setup your multidisc player for uninterrupted play, and transport yourself to 1980, Paris. Oh, and by the way - standout track is the climactic ""Crime of the century"". The guitar part is verging out-of-control, and the sax part will rip your heart out!"
4,4.2 Prog Rockers Live,"Supertramp was/is one of the only bands that i like outside the hard rock/Metal genre. This cd is why. The distinct differences of the Hodgson/Davies come accross great here. The atmosphere is nice and the keyborads sound more crisp here than the studio versions. Was nice to get this and remember the late '70's with these gems. From ""School"" to the closing ""Crime of the Century"" this cd shows Supertramp in their peek. Great stuff."
1,Gary Morris: Live DVD,"This was the worst DVD I've ever seen. It was very poorly done and the sound was horrible. It must have been done in some sort of bar because you could see the waiters carrying drinks in the background. Gary Morris, as much as I love his music, is not a performer. He just stands there. If he spoke, you couldn't understand what he said. The entire hour was a huge disappointment."
2,A Tired Retread,"Not only is this book lacking an original thought, it is not even written in a sprightly fashion. The test is interrputed with trite quotes from unknown and uninteresting individuals notated by first name only, ie, ""Annabelle"" ""Eva"".If you are really interested in the laws of attraction and manifestation, read anyting by Catherine Ponder, Jerry and Esther Hicks (the Abraham people), Joe Vitale or Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting by Lynn Grabhorn."
3,A brief study on the birth of Greek science,A reasonable discussion on how the Greeks started us on the road to modern science. Nothing particularly brilliant or new. Probably good for a text book.
4,My daughter loved it,She is a huge sonic fan. This key chain made her happy. It is not entertaining or educational. It is hardly a toy. It does allow her to decorate her back pack with Sonic and crew. She does get joy out of it being there. It is decently made.
1,Yuck!,"Who makes pot roast with worchestshire and A-1? I did because the recipe instructed me to do so and I was sorely disappointed. This is not the first time I've regretted following a recipe from this book, but it will definitely be my last. Yuck!"
1,Sylvia's Soul Food,"I thought the book was really bad. Most of the food they had recipes for were not in my kitchen. Guess I'm not meant to be a ""soul food"" cook."
4,"Basic Recipes, but never fail!","I use this cookbook frequently - although the recipes are basic, found in quite a few ""soul food"" cookbooks they are never fail for me - I have not found a bad one yet out of the book."
3,Not a romantic comedy,"This movie was well done with first rate acting. That being said, it was depressing and slow. I don't see how any critic could say ""Hilarious"" or even call it a romantic comedy. It was a serious drama, with a few slight humorous moments. So don't expect big laughs with this one. I felt worse after watching it than I did before I watched it!"
3,just ok,"""Jack Goes Boating"", is film that is full of symbolism about facing fears. I thought it was just OK, but not the best of films it left me lost. It trailed off in many ways. Rent of buy at your own risk, and remember it is not for children."
2,...and Yaleburton takes a nap.,"Philip Seymour Hoffman takes his stab at directing -- and what we get is the ""quirky yet casual"" storytelling that typifies indie movies these days. Cheesy shot selection, ironic editing, and poor direction of actors all scream out ""hipster"" with each scene. Pretty painful. One extra star because it does not feature Miley Cyrus."
2,WEIRD PREMISE,"Any character who is as socially dysfunctional as the one Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays in this film would not be able to work as a limo driver. The film's premise is off-putting right from the start. And then it goes downhill from there. It doesn't establish a tone - is it a comedy, is it serious, what is it? It's kind ofcreepy, actually, and I had better things to do with an hour and half of my time."
2,"Better than most artists, junk for sabbath though...","It's an okay record but it cant compare to any of sabbaths original 8 albums or even heaven and hell or the mob rules, it is better than eternal idol. I mean its not horbbile but when you compare tony martin to OZZY, please. Ozzy wipes the floor with him easily. Its good music if you like late 80s hard rock. But if you like Zepplin and Sabbath of the 70's be ware, its not what youre looking for."
2,Iommi/Martin getting stale...,"This album is mostly a real bummer... lacking memorable riffs (except for the saving grace ""Anno Mundi"") and innovative song writing. Boring, boring, boring... I hardly ever play this album, which I can't say about most other Sabbath releases. I don't know, you think they're selling out on ""Feels Good to Me."" That's a hypothetical question, of course."
4,A very decent effort!,"Featuring Tony Martin in prime vocal form-what a great vocalist!-'Tyr'is not only a very heavy and hard hitting album,it is actually better than forgettable titles such as 'Never Say Die'or'Live Evil'.'Feels Good to Me'is probably one of the best tunes they ever wrote.Time to move out of the Ozzy-Dio paradigm!"
2,Just an SPF,I've been using this product everyday for the past month but haven't noticed any visible change in the sun spots that I have. No adverse side effects but product did not live up to my expectations.
4,"Six of one, half dozen of the other...","The English folk-rock band Lindesfarne was one of many groups to fill the void in the UK charts following the dissolution of the Beatles in the early 1970s. Their mix of lilting folk and (only moderately clompy) rock seems an unlikely contender for ""the next big thing,"" but decades later their music holds up rather well... These are vintage live performances on the BBC, profiling the band at its youthful best. Nice stuff... about as good as they got!NOTE: for some reason Amazon has this listed as ""box set,"" but it is not. Just one disc here, but it is a very good disc."
3,Snowglobe,I liked the Snowglobe movie better than the Holiday in Handcuffs. I love to watch Christmas movies and the Snowglobe was very fun to watch.
4,Rolling On,"Everybody who's writing those ""I was eargerly anticipating the 2nd album, but it's crap etc etc"" reviews, forget that EVERYONE when they first heard the Transplants, were slightly nonplussed - admit it. Haunted Cities - Just more innovation & grooves....Download it today....."
1,HUGE dissapointment,"Come on guys, what the heck is this crap? The self-titled cd was a masterpiece that will be one of my favorite cds forever. Their sophomore album however is not worth listening to more than once or twice. Don't waste your money on this cd go buy the self-titled instead."
2,Watson Meets OCR,"Thomas Watson's works are always satisfying. However, the errors by the character recognition used in the printing of this edition make this edition a frustrating read. Punctuation marks for no reason. Entirely wrong words: ""intestinal divisions"" should perhaps read ""internal divisions?"" By page 31, I decided to find a faithful edition."
2,Uptown Rather than Downhome,"Awash with strings, vibraharp, and latin percussion, Latin Shadows moves uptown from the gritty downhome flavor usually associated with Ms. Scott and her contemporaries on the Hammond B-3. More morning after than night before. Blame, or credit, producer Bob Thiele and arranger/conductor Gary McFarland. Most memorable of Ms. Scott's work is her vocals on ""Soul Sauce,"" composition ""Noche Azul,"" and organ on Henry Mancini's ""Dreamsville."" This CD would be enjoyed by devotees of Creed Taylor's CTI productions in the seventies and later smooth jazz formats. Still, organ students in dozens of university jazz programs could have filled in Ms. Scott's parts without missing a beat."
5,Beautiful Pictures,A coffee table book sure to inspire you. This book was one of the things that really sparked my interest in nature photography. The stunning vistas and colors will capture your imagination and inspire you to travel to the beautiful places of this country!
1,One Star,NOT The Simpsons is the GREATEST show EVER! I have been watching the simpsons since I was four. What a hit.
5,Fifth season of the Simpsons....D'oh-nt you just love it!,"The fifth season of The Simpsons has it all. A 100th episode...Sideshow Bob...Buzz Aldrin and George Harrison! This is an outrageous side splitting season of life in Springfield. Favorites in this set...Treehouse of Horror IV...The Last Temptation of Homer...and Deep Space Homer. As a longtime Simpsons fan,it's good fun for everyone!"
5,The Season that started it all...,"Season 1 was choppy at best and the writers were still feeling their way around. Around Seasons 2 & 3, they realized that the comedy gold was not in Bart but Homer and the show's focus started to switch to him, all the animation got much, much better. Season 4, you could see the jokes getting sharper and the writers were really mastering their domain.And in Season 5, it all came together. Season 5 is definitely the year in which The Simpsons became the funniest show on television. Some of the best episodes of the entire series are in Season 5 (Homer and Apu, The B-Sharps) and if there is any one season to own of The Simpsons, it's this one. Also the Treehouse of Horrors start to get better around this season as the previous ones are all pretty lame. Treehouse of Horror was never that great though but there have been some choice eps (teachers eating students story, Willie the gardner killing students in their sleep, etc.)"
2,Eesh....,"Well, it's not bad. Like others mentioned, there are a few tracks that are like Bent's previous stuff and they're great but not as fantastic as some of their earlier, amazing singles. If you love the other 3 ""released"" cd's like I do, then this one will be the weakest of them. The first cd had some cheesy songs w/ cheesy ""guy"" singing but it kinda worked for me and had great beats and slide guitars & stuff in the music to make up for it. And they were just plain fun tracks inbetween absolutely amazing ones. Half this cd, which is under 50 mins., is pretty darn good and the other half is kinda crap. Where Ariels and the other cd's have me coming back for more listens, I find myself not really caring about this cd as much. I still have faith in them though- they'll come back with a better cd. -- I hope."
2,Religious Studies and Theology,"While this book's intended purpose is primarily to overview all religions through an unbias point of view and to expose a ""non-believer"" to many types of viewpoints held by great intellectual thinkers, it's purpose is inherrently flawed. For religion's primary focus should be to view the world through ""God's eyes and emotions"", and not through the many different ways man tries to view itself via religious modes."
1,Junk,"This company isn't known for being a quality manufacturer, but I did have higher expectations than it delivered. It lasted about 60 days, made okay coffee, and failed to impress."
1,Broke within 6 months and can't figure out how to get replaced,Bought this item back in March of 2005 and it just stopped working in September of 2005 after only minor use (2x a week maybe).I would like to find out how to get this P.O.S. replaced on the warranty but I can't seem to find a contact to make it happen.Do yourself a favor and note the several reviews in here that forewarn you to look elsewhere for another coffeemaker.
1,lousy coffee maker,Filters were hard to find and then the coffee maker stopped working after couple of weeks. Please do not waste your money on this lousy coffee maker.
3,Good Story...Very Long Read!,"I first read this book when I was in the eight grade in order to gain points for a school program called accelerated reader. It took FOREVER to read this book, and althogh it is a very witty story, it is an increadibly long, and sometimes boring read as well. I recently read it agian, and watched the movie too(Which I don't recomend to anyone, unless you are a fan of Reese Witherspoon or Legally Blond)and althouhg I found a lot more flavor in it, I had to literally put the book down for a long time and take a nap or eat a lot of sugar in order to continue. But if you are like me and you feel you MUST read as many classics as you can, Vanity Fair is a must in your classics list."
5,Uncanny!,"I had this book on my shelf unread for years, thinking it was tedious and boring, but what a revelation when I picked it up after seeing the movie. The note of the other reviewer re C.L.R. James, the left-wing Trinidadian author and historian, was apt, and uncanny, as I found this book could have easily be called ""Westmoorings"", an area in Trinidad populated by people of the exact mindset (and indeed I have heard many times the very same spoken words as the characters). Indeed, there are many places in the Caribbean, or world, populated by people like this. I see why this book is historically taught in literature in high school in the US but not in the Caribbean."
2,a difficult book,"This classic is very difficult to read. Not only is it boring, but the way it's written is weird and jumpy. I did not enjoy the book. I only got through a few chapters before I gave up. It is also very long."
3,"Good album, but not a classic","Redbelly is an overlooked band from the mid 90's and they definitely have that sound. It's before alternative turned to crap and we ended up with bands like Bush and Creed. Overall, it's an enjoyable listen and I like to throw it on occasionally, but it's not an album that I would want to be buried with. Like the other reveiwer said, there definitely aren't any ""hooks"" in this album, but it's still good. If you can find it cheap, buy it."
2,After a few months of Wear,Sorry to say this mattress has broken down after only a couple months of wear. It was nice at first but you have to have durability. If I could get my money back I would.
2,TO DO PENANCE,"Many may applaud this ballet but I cannot. After having immensely enjoyed a ballet from the Royal Opera House - ELITE SYNCOPATIONS choreographed by Kenneth Macmillan - and wanting to have a nice evening with ballets I continued selecting another one. I remembered I was not satisfied with ASCHENBRÖDEL the first time I watched it and, thinking I was perhaps wrong,I set eyes on it again confirming my first opinion. Customs and scenery of immense bad taste, choreography with rather ugly surprises, no fun but deadly boredom. The audience 'va in brodo di giuggiole' as we say in Italy and burst out in loud applause: chi si contenta gode! The orchestra does not deserve a prize for its refinement but it still remains the winner. In conclusion: you can enjoy this ballet if you close your eyes.Ernesto Oppicelli - Genoa/Italy"
4,Worthwhile,"I was a little worried at first that this documentary would be biased and propagandize for something that I do not believe in. I was pleasantly surprised, however, by what I saw. Karl Hess and Murray Bookchin were previously unknown to me but I appreciated their perspective. The link between libertarianism and anarchism is explored and gave me something to think about. Previously, I never understood the anarchic libertarians I knew but I now have newfound respect for their perspective. That Hess associated with Murray Rothbard was a point in his favor as was the director going to a Libertarian Party convention in the late seventies when it was filmed. Lastly, the eschewing of violence here is something everyone should take note of."
2,crapola,"GBH is the best punk/hardcore band of all time. No question, but this record is lame. No hooks, the double kick is over the top. They got back on track after they made this so all is forgiven."

1,Manufacturer Rip-Off,"The test solution is only good for 3 months after opening. This fairly means thata new bottle needs to be purchased every 3 months. We pay a significant amount of money to Lifescan for test strips that are useless unless tested using their solution that expires 3 months after opening. If Lifescan's policy is to not rip-off its customers, then they need to include the test solution with the test strips."
5,Product Evaluation,This product was perfect for the monitor I purchased. It provided the control assessment required to insure the results were accurate.
2,Different fleas on a different dog,"Once again frontline takes a topic, that's been handled in 60 different ways and tries to convince you that they're doing something unique heroine is bad you will get addicted to it very easily and ruin your life. So now frontline tries to insert stories of collateral damage from Mr. brownstone my heart goes out to that girl and her family but couldn't you say using her stories entertainment is somewhat depressing I would not recommend this documentary for someone withdrawling from opium or any opium derivatives it will only make you feel worse and you don't need that at this juncture after two with three of these documentaries you've seen them all respectfully Johnny Irish"
4,"Punchy mix of folk, country and rock","From droning, Celtic-influenced folk to hard-edged country twang, Knight (ex-Blood Oranges) sings with the directness of Kelly Willis and the pop sensibilities of Matthew Sweet. But where Willis' extra-Country excursions can sound contrived, and Sweet's penchant for 70s jamming can get tiresome, Knight's production team of Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy ably follow her musical twists and turns, keeping everything on track.The album is full of exhilarating songs and segues. The mandolin of ""All Blue"" that emerges from the distortion of ""Dead Man's Curve"" grabs the listener's attention with its simplicity and purity, while the chiming guitar and harmonies of ""Rose In The Vine"" lift the listener up, deepening the plunge into the country fiddle and blue mood of ""If Wishes Were Horses.""Earle plays all manner of stringed instruments, ex-dB Will Rigby provides punchy drumming, and guest harmonies from Emmylou Harris and Siobhan Kennedy supply a finishing touch."
1,"This ""Doctor"" is a very hard stretch...","I realize in this subject matter every airy-fairy author can jump on the bandwagon, originated by Carlos Castanada and write a book and make lots of money and not have to be concerned about ""proving"" or validating any of the ""experiences"" I was hoping this book being authored by a MD. might be a bit more factual and believible, a major disapointment of an MD, that would resort to this to make money."
3,Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus,"Great movie, but I was very disappointed that it is only in FULLSCREEN and not in widescreen in this two movie version. I could not find anywhere in the write-up whether it is fullscreen or widescreen, but I love the movie."
5,I Love it!,"Great Christmas movie, just wish I could find the 2nd movie ""Meet the Santa's"" I enjoyed A Boyfriend for Christmas too!"
4,I'll be back for more of this,"I recently finished using this supplement and have to admit that it works. I wasn't doing anything different with my workouts, just normal gym stuff. I take this before and after my weight routine and only on those days. It seems to work. I just feel different when I take it. I last longer in the gym and want to continue the workout. I'd recommend this to others."
1,Metal Tool Chest,"Purchased as a gift for my son-in-law...It was smaller than I expected, however, it is large enough for a spare toolbox at the house.Unfortunately, the Bottom cabinet was received dented at the bottom right corner of the cabinet...beyond repair... and the lock is missing (however...we received the keys).I did not open the box before Christmas, and only discovered it on the 6th of January while at my son's home. I do not want to spend another $50 to have it shipped back at this point.It would be nice to have the dented cabinet replaced... with a lock!!VERY DISAPPOINTED..."
4,A competent short history of World War II's greatest leader.,"As a previous reviewer has stated, this is a good short history of Winston Churchill. Keegan does a competent job of giving us the short version on this great man. However it is not really inspired writing, and not a page turner. I found myself plodding through this book and wondering when the tempo would change. It didn't. All of the highlights of Churchill's life are there, it just didn't flow well.There are many great books about Winston Churchill. Some comprise several volumes. I would rate Manchester the best in terms of biography. Keegan's book is a good first start for those who don't know much of Churchill."
4,Essence of Churchill,"If you read just one book on Winston Churchill, this is a great pick. Those who have read other books by Keegan, like ""A History of Warfare"" or ""The Mask of Command"", know that he is one of today's best writers on the subjects of conflict and leadership. He delivers again in this jewel box life of Winston Churchill.The brevity of this work is actually an advantage for Keegan. He is free to concentrate on motivation and character, rather than chronicling the enormous record of Churchill's life. Those interested in detail would be much better served by Martin Gilbert's ""Churchill"", or even Churchill's own ""The Second World War"". By concentrating on themes of Churchill's life like his use of language, belief in the manifest destiny of the English-speaking peoples, and strength of character even when beset by physical ailments, Keegan paints a vivid, personal portrait of one of the greatest leaders of the modern era."
3,"""Publishers Weekly"" is Mistaken","Publisher's Weekly is entirely mistaken, in their comments above, in suggesting that Sir Winston Churchill once belonged to the Labour Party.He never did, of course.Churchill did, however, cross the floor to join the Liberal Party, often making common cause there with his Liberal ally David Lloyd George. He left the Liberals and returned to the Conservative Party (at first, as a ""Constitutionalist"") in the 1920's...Alan D. Hyde"
2,Disappointing cutie,"It was incredibly cute, I loved looking at it. However, it was hard to get the coffee out when it became partially full. You had to turn it almost upside down. The lack of functionality sent it back."

4,Get It!,"I bought this CD when Near and Ronnie Gilbert performed at a local church a while back. Little did I know that it pretty much preserved the magic of the evening.Each song is a gem with Near and Gilbert weaving (pun intended) their vocal magic. The real treat, though, is the closing three-song medley featuring Wood Guthrie's ""Pastures of Plenty"" and Phil Och's patriotic ""Power and the Glory."" What a way to close a show! And what a pleasure to hear ""Power and the Glory"" sung by two such beautiful voices.I realize that as she gets older, Ronnie Gilbert won't be touring much anymore. You'd be prudent to grab this gem now and enjoy her live performance while she's still around. This is timeless music for everybody. And if you get a chance to see them perform live, take the whole family (no violence or profanity). You won't be sorry."
3,Sweetly sour,"3 1/2BR were still digging up quite a bit of dirt here, but hints are abound to their eventual crossover into finer delicacies. As it stands, IAEOTI merges the trio's grimier, angular indie instincts with slowly maturing songwriting."
5,Great craft materal,Something I love to have around when grandchildren come Beautiful colors and the thiCkness makes it easy for little fingers to work with.
3,Disappointed...,"None of the details specified the size of the cookie cutter so I assumed it would be the size of an average cookie cutter. It measures 3 inches long and should say ""MINI"" in the title because it is a very small cookie cutter and I won't be able to add many decorations because of the size."
5,Share this book with your kids!,"This book is a tradition for our family -- our kids eagerly anticipate getting it out of the ""Easter"" box every spring. The illustrations are very beautiful yet very kid-friendly -- I *loved* the fact that they show children who (despite their era-appropriate clothing) look like any child you'll see today riding down the street on a skateboard. Also, Jesus has dark hair -- the illustrator didn't turn our thoroughly Jewish Lord into a blond haired, blue eyed European as so many artists do. Kudos for that! I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
2,Mr. Barbara Streisand vs. The Satanic Auto,"A movie so bad it begs for the Mystery Science Theatre treatment. Just consider the following: Mr. Barbara Streisand as a small town sheriff, Kathleen Lloyd, with a voice more irritating than Jennifer Tilly's, as the town's most beloved teacher, Ronny Cox as a spineless alcoholic, R.D. Armstrong as a wife-beating boor and a 1965 Lincoln with tinted windows as Satan. Yes, the perfect formula for one absurdly bad, but amusing film. Satan, er, I mean the 1965 Lincoln, comes to town and immediately runs over and over and over and over John Rubinstein, and then it really gets serious. This car/Satan hates everybody. But, if like me, you'll find yourself cheering on the Lincoln, especially when it leaves the ground (yes, you read that correctly) to travel through Kathleen Lloyd's kitchen. This movie is truly a hoot. I never understood why there was never a ""The Car, Part 2"". Enjoy the road."
4,The car from Hell?,"One day, a mysterious black car rolls into the sleepy desert town of Santa Ynaz. It begins killing people so the sherriff must battle it. I've waited so long for this video to be reprinted. The special widescreen edition includes the original theatrical trailer at the films conclusion."
1,The Car-five stars for the car-0 for acting and for the Quote at the start of the movie.,"The Car is a Mean Looking Cannibalized Lincoln(Or StinkinCar-Ford),the acting except for The Native Americans and the brunette is Terrible,plot even for an 70's Horror movie is laughable and the End seemed like a Comedy.And Annoyingly Bab I mean Brolin with his SmugMug as the so-called star,The car is the Star(Thanks George Barris.)And What really grinds my gears is the quote at the start of the film,A Horror movie that is amusing and funny."
2,Terrible. DeLorme missed the mark with this state for sure...,"I have numerous other DeLorme Atlases, Utah, Arizona, Florida...and they are all great products. The Georgia version is AWFUL. No detail, the majority of roads are unmarked; very poor execution. When compared to Florida's Atlas, this one looks like a kid drew it up. Don't bother with this one; maybe try Rand McNally or another company."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I didn't get a great deal out of this DVD. There are a lot of subtitles and, at least on my TV, they were very hard to read. If your looking for a ""how to"" this isn't it, in my opinion. This is more of a ""I believed and it worked for me."""
4,great-not surprising or anything,"I love these cds of course-they are just not as good as the ""blue ones"";) I would recommend if for some reason you are just starting out with the beatles to get these before the blue, however-many more heard of songs on this one I think. Very good, happy songs-improves my mood every time.-Blonde in Black"
2,Music is Great - price is a rip-off,I love the Beatles. I love every song on this collection. What bothers me is the fact that there is slightly more than 65 minutes worth of music in this collection and it is released as a double cd with double cd PRICES! This entire collection would fit nicely on a single disc. I feel the record companies (EMI and Capital)are taking advantage of Beatle fans by overpricing this item. Buy it used and save some money!
4,"BIG, BAD, BABBLIN' BOB SPEAKS","Ah, the ""Red"" album. Hear the Beatles in all of their pop glory before the seeds of discontent (and lots of really bad mind altering drugs) turned them into Lords of Acid.This album is a blistering testement to powerpop at its best. All the hits are here. You can't throw a stone at this album without bouncing a rock off the melon of John,Paul,George or even (eech) Ringo singing one of their fab hits.This record has sold so many copies, it'll keep Ringo in nasal decongestives for life! A must have for fans."
4,pretty good compilation,"This is an album to get if you are not a serious Beatles fan but like some of thier earlier hits. I love all the songs on the album especially In My Life, Yesterday, and Eleanor Rigby. However they could have added a few more songs on, especially ones from their album Revolver, such as Taxman, I'm Only Sleeping, Good Day Sunshine, etc. Overall, this is a good album to start off with. Oh, as for ""A Music Fan from Pennsylvania"", what's your idea of good grownup music, Celine Dion?"
5,Awesome Tunes!,"I thought this Cd was great. When I first got into the Beatles when I was around 10 years old, I got this for my birthday, and I couldn't stop listening to it.If you are a Beatles fan, this is the album to get. I personally loved She Loves You, All My Loving, Help!, Michelle, In My Life (For those unfamiliar with the title, it's also known as the Providence theme song), and Girl.If you like this mix of music, then you might also want to check out the Blue album, with songs from 1967-1970."
3,"Good, but missing some of the Beatles greatest moments...","Hey, I'm Sam. I just turned 13 (that doesn't mean I can't do a kids review, right?). Anyways...I think this is a pretty good compilation, but it is missing some of their best like, ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Rain"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""Do You Wan't to Know a Secret"", ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""She's a Woman"", ""Taxman"", ""Tommorow Never Knows"", ""And Your Bird Can Sing"", and other great songs. I mean they could have fit it all on there. The entire CD can fit on one CD, with room for more songs. I mean it is REALLY short. And the aranging wasn't that good. I mean who would listen to ""Drive My Car"" rather than ""Rain""? I mean it's a great song, but I don't think it's a greater hit than ""Rain."" My solution: If you have the money, buy the albums and make a better compilation on iTunes. If you don't have the money, get this and the blue album."
5,Timeless Fun,"My 5 year old watched this video over and over and over (you get the point) when she was a toddler. Now my twin 1 year olds have begun watching it. They LOVE it. Ernie and Bert are their favorite Sesame Street characters and the short skits and fun songs keep them glued to the TV for the whole 25 minutes. My 5 year old was also scared of the ""Egypt"" section, but not until she was about 4. Up until then she loved it."
5,Many Time Kouros User,I had to write a new review after I started to wear Kouros again after not wearing it for a long time. I have used many different fragrances and Kouros definitely has a unique smell. The combination of spices and florals in Kouros is just perfect. I can't begin to tell you how many compliments you get when you wear Kouros. I usually wear Kouros when I go out on special occasions and it never disappoints. This cologne last 2 days if you don't take a shower.(I'm not kidding!) Kouros is the best cologne I have in my collection. I have other good fragrances but I would pick this cologne over any other one if I'm going out for something special. Kouros Tip: spray 2 sprays on your hair and 5 or 6 sprays on your clothes.......perfect. I wear Kouros in winter or summer and it smells unbelievable. This is my 100 dollar cologne. Love this stuff!!!
3,AMELIA,"I love any thing concerning Amelia Earhart. I love the fact that she was way ahead of her time, and that she was , most definitely, her own person! I was slightly disappointed with this DVD. I knew that it was only 50 minutes long; however, I was hoping they would have a bit more of up-to-date information on this DVD. Otherwise, it is interesting to watch."
5,Best Italian recipe book ever,"You will love this! The recipes are clear, many are so simple yet delicious. The book is one of the best for fresh vegetables, and then there are the pasta and chicken dishes. I've yet to try a recipe that wasn't great.The book is particularly useful if you need to do dinner in 30 minutes and want something elegant, flavorful and fast.Highly recommended."
4,Very Nice,"The bra is not as long like the description, but its close, very fitting, and it was here in a week! I would recomend this product, its very white and very comfy! perfect for my wedding dress"
2,Didn't even wear,I bought it to go under a bridesmaid dress but I couldn't even wear it because it was too bulky. By the time I realized it the time had passed and I couldn't return it. Now I'm stuck with something I can't use.
4,oops,"The product arrived quickly and was as described, very satisfactory service and product. Unfortunately, I should look at the size and actually check the measurements so the product is appropriate for what I need it for...completely my fault! lulz"
1,don't waste your money.,text seems to be copied out of the cruise line's web sites. You can go there for free - don't waste your money.
5,Awsome Calendar,This Calendar has some of the most ADORABLE pictures I have ever seen. I have given this calendar to a few of my friends and all of them loved it and get a big kick out of the inventive photography. I hope everyone can enjoy it as much as I have.
5,"AGAIN, WONDERFUL JOB!","I have all but one of the ferret company ferret calendars done by Jeanne Carley. Every year, it is one of the top items on my Christmas list. Again, the pictures have captured the funny moments of these silly creatures. If you are a ferret fan, you will appreciate the pictures in this calendar."
5,Ferret Photography,"Jeanne Carley's ferret photography is beautiful, funny and top quality. She makes these adorable little animals even more adorable and can bring a smile to this ferret lover's face. Thank you, Jeanne, for loving what you do and sharing it with the rest of us!"
3,Want to know what this is?,"Just got this from amazon, played on my region free player but not my region one player. It's a roughly half hour compilation of monster clips (and some fights) from assorted Max episodes. Included are clips of Eleking, Gomora, Metron and Batlan plus various new monsters. I was surprised to see that the show has a somewhat campy/jokey approach as opposed to classic series such as the 1966 Ultraman. The monster suits have awesome detail but somehow look artificial in a way that these characters didn't in their 6os appearances. They look more like giant, living Bandai toys than the ""suspend your disbelief/pass for real"" monsters of the old days. Maybe it's the lighting. But it's definitely deliberate. In any case, there's a lot of reverence for (and reference to) the earlier series and I'd love to see a Region One release of the actual episodes. Or at least the ones with Red King. Shee-YAAARRHH!!!!"
5,Love it!,"I love the smell of this product. I feel like a new person after showering and when washing my hands with it, I can't help but bring my hands to my nose."
1,Waste of money,You won't like my review. The item has very little power. The blower is weak with little air coming out to suck up the bug. A waste of money.
1,"Great idea, but cheap junk",Works great when remote will work. Cannot navigate menus without remote. Not sure if it is the remote or the IR sensor in the boat anchor.
4,"Well worth the money, shame about the other cartoons","The Cat Came back is a great cartoon, i first saw it a good 5 - 6 years ago, and have been looking for it ever since. Although i throughly enjoyed the Cat Came Back, the trailers at the beginning and the other 5 cartoons were a major letdown, that is why i can only give it 4 stars. Get it anyway, well worth it :)"
5,Great doll!,The doll's face is accurately portrayed and the uniform is beautifully detailed. Great for a collector and It also makes an excellent gift.
5,Best pop-up tent!,"Chose this tent for my nearly 3 year old daughter after doing research on many other pop-up tents. Most others had the constant complaint in their reviews that they collapse too easily while the child is in the tent. This one stays up! It's easy enough to collapse when you want to put it away, but we've been too busy playing with it to put it away much yet! Her favorite method of entry is to cannon-ball herself through the door, so if it's durable to withstand that and not fall down, you know it's good quality! Great hideaway for imaginative play with her dress up clothes and princess dollies. Keep checking, and hopefully Amazon will bring it back in stock soon!"
4,"Not as pictured, but still a great tent","As a previous reviewer also mentioned, the one we received looks a little different from what's pictured. It has a horse and carriage on one (long) left side, and is effectively blank on the right side, but no matter-- it's very cute. (I prefer the design of the one we got, actually.) It doesn't have the little peeking window on top, either.I found the tent easy to set up, and it stays up quite easily, too. It's been set up in my house for about 8 months with no problems whatsoever with collapsing or ripping. The only thing that happens around here is that my daughter takes off the flag and it winds up all over the house. I wish it were harder to remove so she'd quit doing that!It's a good size-- I can squeeze in there with her if I really want to, but it's certainly good for two (maybe three) kids."
4,Just short of magnificent,"I do think that Ms. McKennitt has a magnificent voice and on its own this would be a magnificent album. But it does fall just short when comparing it to her previous works. The entire album has a slightly overcast disposition, missing a lighter happier piece. I certainly appreciate the distinctly eastern slant of this (and some previous) work as well as the rich musicality--did I mention her voice, that voice. But I was somewhat disturbed by the adoption in ""Beneath a Phyrgian Sky"" of a thematic riff that came straight from ""The Bonny Swans"" (from The Mask and The Mirror). My favorite McKennitt albums remain ""Elemental"" (""Stolen Child"" is amazing) and ""Parallel Dreams""."
1,Boring,"I have all of Loreena's music and looked forward with bated breath to this new creation. It was, however, quite boring. Just the same old same old. Disappointing to say the least."
3,I'm just not feeling this one,"For some reason this album just didn't move me. Yes, it is ably produced and LM has worked hard to evoke a certain mood, but much to my surprise, I actually yawned through it. I have her previous releases, but this one...it's a soundtrack suited for background music in new age shops and massage parlours used to create a ""magical"" atmosphere, but ultimately doesn't reach the heights of before. Either that or there's to much an air of pretension that overrides her good intentions. It will remain in my library - for now."
3,Not Bad but Not Great,"After a while, all of Lorena Mckennitt's music starts to sound the same to me. This was an attempt to get some of her earlier music to get a feel as to how she has evolved. A lot of phrases seem to carry over to her more recent works."
3,strange difficulties,"While I enjoy the music on the CD which I bought from amazon.com, I cannot seem to download it to my real player and play it on my computer as I can every other CD I buy. Also, I can only hear it by going to their website which came up as netscape which is no longer supported. I'm not sure if these people are just behind in technology or doing something weird to protect against piracy or what but probably I won't buy any more of this artist's work."
3,Falls short of Loreena's usual perfection,"There are some good tracks on this CD, but there are also some less than good ones. All and all it doesn't have the soul of her previous recordings. Loreena's voice remains good, but you don't feel the haunting, spiritual quality that made her earlier work far above average. As someone else mentioned, your first impression will be disappointing because you're given a folded cardboard wrapped around a CD. Everything about Loreena's new offering falls just short of her usual perfection. You may find you are not amused (sorry, couldn't resist).Try to listen to this recording before you buy it."
3,The Best of Christmas,"I like it because there are a variety of artists on the CD, but nothing really stood out as exceptional. It arrived less than 10 days in great condition."
3,Table Mate II,"I use this in the tilted position for a reading table. It serves its purpose well. The table is worth about half of the price I paid for it. I later learned I could have bought two for one from the TV ad. In addition, I waited longer than I should have to receive this item."
2,Table Mate II - not so great,"This product turned out to be a lot flimsier and less stable than I had expected. The dimensions are right, the base fits under the couch/bed, wherever you're sitting and for that purpose it works. However, I wouldn't advise putting anything requiring a level surface on top of it, such as a beverage or food item. At it's finished position, the top surface is not flat or level. It's more like an easel at a slight downward angle so things have a tendency to slip off. I tried adjusting both the legs and the top surface but it never achieved a steady surface level.It's fine for propping up books or magazines, but that's about it. Not worth the money as a couple of crates could do the same job."
4,Great summer read.,"Loved this book. The relationships - sister to sister; dad to daughter, teacher to student - were so real. I could imagine all this happening in the home next door. Jessica is a rare writer and I hope to read many future books. Why only four stars - truly, I haven't read a five star book in years. So four is tops with me."
3,Too much description.....,"While I enjoyed reading the book for the most part, I became frustrated because the author described everything in way too much detail, except the important parts. I wish she had described the babies birth more(The author devoted 1 1/2 pages to the birth) and the things surrounding the hiding of the baby as this is what the book was supposed to be about. Instead, the author described things of insignifigance and I became bored by it. The whole book seemed a little unreal to me and kind of turned into a soap opera, but I did seem to like Kate and Tyler and finished the book."
2,"JUST ""SO-SO""","THIS SIMULATOR IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ""2004"": VERSION. IT TAKES TOO MUCH ROOM AND YOU MUST HAVE A REALLY GOOD COMPUTER.I HAVE ORDERED THE ""2004"" VERSION WHICH I BELIEVE TO FUNCTION BETTER."
1,Depressing,"Strange to see Haujobb mutate from this gothic self-indulgence to the cyber vision of ""Solutions for a Small Planet"". This album is only for the hardcore goths out there. I should know - I used to be one (shhhh...). There are already signs here of electronic genius, but the ""life owes me"" attitude spoils it. The title track is about the only worthwhile number here, besides some impressive loops and effects. Yeah, my opinion is biased and I have the right to be. If you're into original cyber, get ""Solutions"", or if you like a strange minimalist mix of lounge, cyber and ambient, get ""Ninety Nine"". On the other hand, if you like NIN, Lether Strip and the third generation B-grades/clones/""Dark Wave"" found on some Cleopatra Records releases, this'll be right up your alley..."
3,Hits and Misses,"Hits:This book is a good read for beginners. Wonderful advice on finding the right instructor and the importance of lessons. There are good examples to support his reasoning.Misses:Some of the chapters appeared redundent, as some of the points from one chapter seemed to be carried into another. Some of the chapters were rather boring because of this, and the book lacked the flow that I was looking for from subject to subject. While it does offer some good advice for beginning/novice golfers, I found it to be of no significant help to more accomplished players. Maybe after reading arguably the greatest golfing book he's ever written, ""Golf is a Game of Perfect"", I was expecting more."
5,TASTY AND FILLING!,"I love these muffin bars! Not only are they convenient, but delicious as well. The bars are moist and full of chocolate chips, just the way a chocolate chip muffin should be. They fill me up and satisfy my sweet tooth at the same time. I usually have one for breakfast, and then another later in the day during that looong stretch between lunch and supper. Each bar contains 1 gram of fiber and 25% of the recommended daily calcium, this is especially important to me because I don't drink milk. I keep these on hand for my kids too - they love them and the bars are better for them than a candy bar. Try the banana nut flavor too - they are just as good!"
5,"Sharp, Smart and Insightful Look at the Democratic Party in Virginia","Shawn O'Donnell and Drucilla Badurina obviously know their Congressional District and their subject well, and provide a justified critique of the Democratic Party in northern Virginia. If the Party were to take the suggestions offered, it would go a long way toward electing Democratic candidates in Virginia. The authors exhibit the intelligence, experience and compassion necessary to energize the party and bring about meaningful change for the better. Their account of the confounding passivity (or ineptness?) of the Democratic Party leadership in the Fredericksburg area tracks with my own experience in the Piedmont area of Virginia. Kudos to O'Donnell and Badurina for their bravery in challenging the Party to return to its fighting spirit and its roots."
3,good fit,"The fit is good, but I would prefer a material that allows another material to slide easily over it."
5,PLUG AND PLAY. JUST THAT EASY,"This worked perfectly. I used it along with the same brand of wall plate and keystone insert for coaxial cable. Made sure the inserts snapped into the plate securely, connected the cable to run inside the wall and under the house, connected the other cable to run to my router and buttoned it all up. DONE AND RUNNING PERFECT!"
2,Ho Hum,It was developed in 1300 AD. They shared ancient world paganism. Man was a creation of god. They lived in towns. The knights adhered to chivalry and priests & monks lives were based on religion. The church was concerned with this life as well as the next. Leonardo da Vinci personified the renaissance spirit.
2,Extremely limited,"Got it at a second hand bookstore and have made an attempt to use it alongside my russian class. Let me tell you, this dictionary is extremely limited! I suggest getting the russian-english, english-russian dictionary by kenneth katzner."
4,An old favorite,"I first ran across this book in my step-dad's library in 1978, and fell in love with it immediately. It's chock full of wonderful and interesting stories about interesting salvage operations through the centuries, ending right before it was published.As I get older, I find that I'm interested in more of the technical details of the various salvage operations - the short narratives and pictures just don't do enough justice to such a fascinating subject. But this book still occupies a place of interest on the shelves, 29 years after I first found it."
5,Not completely Vocals,"You won't be disappinted if you are a Al Di Meola fan. At least, Some of the songs are instrmental. It is one of the great albums from Al Di Meola."
1,Yuck! Al goes Hip Hop.,"After complaining for years about people not appreciating good music, Al decides it's time to throw in the towel and go for the bucks like Santana did. Al, hang it up...you're a has been.This rates zero stars."
5,Je l'aime,"I am a French student in the US, and I just happened to pick this album up while I was in Paris. It was one of the best decisions I made on that trip. This album is amazing, and my favorite song is ""Je n'ai pas oublie."" Each song has a unique sound, and is, in my opinion, a good comparison to modern rock. It has also given me a constant source for listening to French and has helped my comprehension. Give this band a chance, you won't be disappointed."
4,"there is only one reason to purchase this ""album""","every beatles album deserves 5 stars. even the worst beatles album deserves 5 stars. the better ones deserve 10 out of 5. i gave this one 4 because it's not even a true beatles album. there is no such thing as a ""greatest hits"" beatles album, period. calling this cd a ""sampler"" would be more appropriate but even then it's completely arbitrary. sampling the beatles is like sampling rock music- it's too diverse. you're better off buying original albums anyway. they should not be dismantled like this.the point of this review is to inform you about ""a day in the life"". as any beatles fan knows, ""sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band (reprise)"" runs into ""a day in the life"" on the sgt pepper's album. here, ""a day in the life"" stands alone (as if it were a single). so basically, you're buying an alternate version of ""a day in the life""- which may be enough a reason for die-hards."
1,Not Great Value,"At $30.00+ and including only a handfull of good songs, this isn't a great value. The red album from the earlier years is immeasurably better!"
3,Complete Recording of Late 60s,"Very well liked if you like the beatles in the Late 60S phase this is the Cd For You !! Very well re-mastered and sounds good Favourites are My Guitar Gently weeps, Let It Be, Lucy in the Sky, Long winding road , A must to have !!!"
1,A mile wide and an inch deep,"This book covers a tremendous amount of material, from code development, to market research, to employee relations, even how to sell your company after it becomes a success. Unfortunately, few subjects are covered in any depth, and even fewer offer any insights beyond the obvious. I will be returning this book. I suggest insteadMicro-ISV: From Vision to Reality, which is the best I've found for the coder trying to sell their software on the Web."
4,"Good Fun, where is the next book!?","This was a set of enjoyable side storys in the universe described by the previous books. But it doesn't close the story of the Achuultani menace, infact they are hardly refered to at all. As it's almost been ten years, I hope nothing has happened to the author. The series realy needs an ending book!As a sort of ""side story"", the book could probably stand on its own better than the second book, but as the first two are so much fun, there really is no reason not to pick those up first before reading this book.Instead of further conflicts involving vast space fleets, this book gets down to the dirty, gritty, bloody, grownd combat style of old earth. But with the twist of four youngsters using advanced technology thrown into the fray. Readers also get to glimps how the new empire is shaping up. Unfortunately one of my favorite elements of exploring more of the galaxy did not carry over from the previous book."
5,Dahak Series,"David Weber is amazing, first read the Honor Harrington series, now this. Can't put any of his books down, I want this series to continue, I'll be 1st in line to purchase....."
3,a mixed bag,"Once upon a time, Oxford was a fine publisher and knew how to make a book such as this a thing of charm and durability.Then the Americans stepped in, and nothing has every been the same.The text here--that is, the translation, both prose and verse--IS charming indeed, but the binding and format are distinctly unlovely. A red ribbon serves to mark the place where sleep overcame one, but the signatures are glue-bound, not sewn, so the book doesn't like to lie open in your lap, and the title gilding is brash and loud, where it should barely whisper of treasures inside."
4,Dictionary of Strum and Picking Patterns,"covers a wonderfully wide range of styles of music. Wish each demo track could be longer but, I realize, that then there couldn't be as many tracks on the CD as there are so it is a trade off. I found I needed to slow the tracks down in a music editing program to get some of them, as some were too fast to grasp initially... for an intermediate like myself. I also used the music program to loop the tracks to hear it more times in a row. I like it over all."
5,It's Butchers Twine,"This is 100% cotton twine and it is biodegradable. This twine is appropriate for any job in the kitchen, whether you need to truss a turkey or tie a lamb's leg. Since it is cotton--which most butcher's twines are--you must keep it away from an open flame. This particular spool gives you 350 feet of twine, which is enough to last a year, or for a casual cook it could last for several years to come."
2,Ouch!,"First, my wife LOVES this disc; she'd give it a much more favorable review.It appears the woman has talent and perhaps even a good voice, but, for the most part I absolutely hate the way she uses her voice on this album. It's like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. On some songs, she sounds like an actor on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE parodying a jazz singer, holding notes forever for no apparent reason or overdoing the ""emotion"" badly. On others, it seems like she screeches and whines and shouts and bends the pitch until the only word that comes to mind is painful. Ouch! Stop it! You've got more talent than that. Sing with some control and good taste!"
4,Excellent blend of instrumental jazz and vocals!,"I am not an experienced listener of jazz music. However, I do know what I like. Holly Cole has a beautiful, throaty alto/tenor voice. The songs show character, but still let you remember what they were really like at their beginning. Sometimes the music does seem to be trying too hard to be ""different"", but it all manages to blend. If you a new spin on some old standrards, this album is great!!!"
1,Noisey,"All my recordings have a snowy noise in them. I contacted the manufacuturer and was told ""Its unfortunately the nature of the beast"". If you own an XLR microphone, you care too much about the sound for this cable to be good enough for you. I returned mine."
2,NOT his best book,"although the usual elements are there--defender of the faithful searching the heart of darkness (his own) at a crucial point in life (middle age); the good-as-gold woman who gets away; the woman who doesn't--sprinkled with stories cops tell each other. But it drags, as if written to a formula not fully developed. Wambaugh writes well, part Hemingway, part Joseph Conrad. But this adventure story for men misses in all but the gastronomical department."
3,The Blue Knight,"I have read most of Joseph Wambaugh's books and enjoy the black humour, characters who spring into life as the twists and turns of the story unfolds. The Blue Knight is not Wambaugh's usual humourous & slick style, but quite melancholy with less interwoven plot and fewer whacky characters. I was disappointed with this one."
4,a truly addictive book,"This is one of the most addictive books that I have ever read - the language is rich and the stories are fascinating. Holmes interweaves his own experiences with short biographical sketches of Robert Louis Stevenson, Mary Wollstonecraft and Percy Shelley. A great book to take on a trip or vacation."
2,Buy it for this one song...,"If you have a spare 12 bucks lying around. The first song ""Life Is a Highway"" is a killer. I went right out, fired up my Harley and let those straight pipes roar down the highway. Gave me the same feeling as the first time I heard BTO's ""Let It Ride"". The rest of the CD made me want to borrow a friends moped and putter through a parking lot."
3,Pop Rock at its Finest?,"I put the question mark on the title because I'm far from convinced that there is such a thing as 'pop rock at its finest.' Certainly, however, this is an enjoyable and very upbeat effort. Its monster hit, ""Life is a Highway,"" is one of the great feel-good songs of all time, and it is followed up well by ""Mad Mad World"" and ""No Regrets,"" among several others. Unfortunately, though, there is no edge to this CD, which is one of the reasons why it works so well as a pop rock CD. Well and good, but ultimately after several listens when you've been pop-rocked out, there's nothing there to keep your attention and interest."
5,Madly In Love,"Sometimes Canadian rockers have more of the American rocker trait we expect American rock to be than those in America. Maybe Brian Adams, Loverboy, and Avril Lavigne are some of the good examples. Tom Cochranefs Mad Mad World released in 1992 really is pure American mainstream pop rock, Bruce Springsteen, John Cafferty, and John Mellencamp during 80s might have been well capable of.I vividly remember Life Is A Highway because this song was used in Japanese TV program, Kyosen-no-Tukaenai-Eigo that shows practical American colloquial expressions to Japanese. The album is really excellent though it takes some time to get you hooked. Some of them are catchy such as NO REGRET, SINGING LIKE A SUNSET, dynamic such as BRAVE AND CRAZY, melodic such as THE SECRET IS TO KNOW WHEN TO STOP and FRIENDLY ADVICE.Recommended for wide range of American, Canadian rock fans particularly, Hooters, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Money, and John Mellencamp fans."
3,Product fine but service not.,The strips themselves are fine. BUT..they arrived in mid-October with an expiration date of November 2009. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to use 100 strips in that time frame. I emailed the company about this issue but got no response.
4,What a great find - perfect for my betta!,"I bought this aquarium for my betta and I just love it. It is very cute, and the light provides the perfect temperature - 76 degrees - of water. My betta really loves it too. I've never seen him so active! He has the perfect amount of space in the right temperature water, and the filter is quiet and works very well. My only complaint is that the top of the aquarium (lid) is not the best quality. It also says it's suitable for two betta fish, with a divider that you can use to separate them. However, split in two, the space is very limited for the fish to swim, so really this is a one-betta tank. Don't get it for two bettas. I do recommend it though. Super low maintenance, great price, and your betta or other fish will be very happy!"
4,"Challenging construction, limited toy","My son saved for months to get this ever since he spotted it in his Lego magazine. As another reviewer indicated, it would be nice if they put all the pieces for a particular unit in a bag and labeled it as such. One ship/car/building/person spread out over 5 bags can get a little monotonous in a 1000+ piece set. Regardless, he joys in getting a new toy everyday (I'm pacing myself to a vehicle a day). Obviously components are not glued tight and with play will fall apart. Lego's can typically be better for 'looking at' rather than 'playing with'. My six and seven year olds' occasionally have problems connecting the pieces as well. I don't know if it is a hand/eye thing or strength issue, but it allows good father/son time to devote to a complex project."
4,Found after 50 years,"I first read this book aged 15. It made such an impression on me that I sought out copies in secondhand shops etc with no success. And now 50 years later I have read it again and found it just as powerful as a conveyance of the notion of adventure and the spirit of youth amidst the insanity of war. The insights into the scant training of the fighter pilots, the conflict between the U.S. and British hierarchy and the maverick attitudes of the pilots help to take us through the actual experience of war in contrast to the 'dates and events' fed to us through history books. What a privilege to be able to read such detailed and private writings of this young man."
5,Great Book!,"I've been working with Symantec security products for years. This book covers both the enterprise version software and exam content very well. If your looking to pass the certification and have a good knowledge of Symantec AV, anti-spam and the firewall products you should be able to pass the exam."
3,Z for Zachariah,"Hey. I'm a thirteen year old boy, and I too have read this book this year in my English class. I chose this book because I thought it would be a fast paced, exciting adventure; but I was mostly wrong. The beginning starts off with her talking about how everyone is dead, and that she is all alone. This gets very repetitive, and I could have easily stopped reading the book. But, the suspense gathered as the mysterious person (John Loomis) comes closer to her home in the valley. But, once John gets sick and she has to take care of him, the book drags on and on. If it weren't for the ending of the book, then I would have given this book 1 out of 5 stars. I have to say that the plot was very well thought, and very amusing, but the fill in between the beginning and the end is BORING. Hopefully, if I read this book 30 years from now I will like it a little bit more. But for now, this book is nothing special."
4,I Liked the book.,This book is very exciting and you never knew what was going to happen next.Ann was very brave putting up with what Loomis was doing to her.
1,This book sucks.,"I don't know what you mean by 'exciting'. This book was a bore from the beginning. I was unfortunate to have to do a novel study on this book. Try doing a vocabulary assignment on this thing. THERE IS NO VOCABULARY. Its written in drab language and the plot is thin. Ann is a boring and vaguely irritating character. I found I didn't care at all about how the chickens were doing or what she cooked or 'poor Mr. Loomis'' fever.Bottom line, this book sucks. Don't read it."
5,~ Book Reviews By Bobbie ~ EXCELLENT BOOK!!!,"Ann Burden is left to fend for herself.While her neighbours and family leave Burden Valley and head to Ogdentown to look for survivors Ann is left at home. She is devastated when they never return.The war has severed communication to the outside world and eventually all electricity is cut off.Surviving the war was the easy part and now...**To read the rest of the Book Review, please go to my blog, ~ Book Reviews By Bobbie ~[...]"
3,alright,"There are some parts in the story where you just have to turn the page and read on, the story line is differen't. But other than that it blabs on a bit about crops, gardens, a water-wheel, etc etc for about 4 whole pages for each which gets frustrating. I still recommend it for young people and adults though. Whatever floats your boat I guess."
2,Not too good,Z for Zachariah tells of Ann Burden and her struggle against John Loomis which is really quite pathetic. The book is one giant death rattle ending in rigor mortis for the author (literally and figuratively). Wow. A bunch of monkeys typing on a 1922 model typewriter could bang out a better story. Thnak you
1,"If you've never bought a stock before, buy this.",This book is for the real novice--the type of investor that will never make it as a day-trader anyway!
3,Learn from the experts,"This book is a series of interviews with very successful day traders. For the beginner, I would recommend ""The Electronic Day Trader"" by the same authors, before reading this book. The last chapter summarizes what's needed to be successful as a day trader, but is not as complete as the authors' previous book."
2,Wake up! This guy's a shark,"Completely worthless piece of incoherent trash with the author's mixture of adolescent science fiction, rehashed Ouspensky, and the usual Gurdjieff pastiche. If the author were at least sincere, his faults would be one thing. Gold is either too far gone to write a book in this field, or else he doesn't care and is about the business of his flypaper routine to keep the newbies flowing with a la carte mystic junk. Remember these Gurdjieff people are no enlightened. Such people have to ply the 'Wake up' theme in ambiguous fashion at the lesser level of getting high on self-consciousness, your natural state. You may be an idiot, but you are already awake in this sense. Settle for nothing less than the real thing, which doesn't require these sufi hustlers.This fellow is one of the cruelest and sadistic of the dog and pony trick occultists that fight over the Gurdjieff non-legacy in a sordid monopoly game in the last farce of the sufis. Give him a wide berth."
2,Junk,"These speakers sound very bad. Easy to install but not worth a penny, I will be junking these and buying something else."
5,The best of the 80's,"This is one of the very best 80's albums ever! I love every song on it and listening to this CD brings me right back to the 80's. This one is a must have for your CD collection. Erasure is by far my favorite band, but this one comes close. Let's see buy this Pet Shop Boys CD, Depeche Mode: The Singles, OMD: The Singles, Erasure: Pop 20, Boy George: Colour By Numbers, B-52's: Cosmic Thing, ABC: Absolutely ABC and you will have a terrific 80's collection! This is one of the best, BEST OF, albums ever!"
3,Hologram Man Was Not Hollow,"If you like this genre of movie,and I do, this was pretty good. The special effects were pretty good. You either liked this movie or you did not. No classic performances. No Oscar nominations. Just good old fationed actioned and superpowers.This would have been a great lead off movie for a series. The fight scenes were great, just the right amount of romance, but there could have been a little less of the shootouts. Joe Lara is one of those actors that should have been a bigger star, but since he is imprisoned in these B-Rated movies, at least he is doing good work. This one does not disappoint."
5,Probably my favorite Molly book!,"This is another in the American Girls series about Molly McIntire, a ten-year-old girl living on the home front during World War 2. In this book, Molly is excited when she finds that a ten-year-old English girl is coming to live with them. However, when she arrives, instead of looking like a fairytale princess, the girl is quite and highly reserved. While getting to know her, Emily learns how different England is from America, and how tragically harder the war has been for the English.This is probably my favorite Molly book! It shows how traumatic World War 2 was for those who lived it, and yet tells the story in an uplifting and entertaining way. My twelve-year-old daughter is a big fan of Molly, and so am I. We both highly recommend this book to you!"
5,Balm for the Grieving Soul,"This is a book about grief that I can go back to again and again on my own journey of grief. Some of his words are beautifully poetic, some are piercing, some are raw, but all of them touched me."
5,"Lord, Please Change My Attitude",I am doing a bibly study at my church with this book. It is very well written and very convicting. It really makes you take another look at how you live your life and how to make it line up with the Lord's will. One of the best I have read and I have read many!
3,goofy...but worth it,"OK so the calendar is a bit much! But the music is definitely worth having...I wish she had done a full-length holday music album, but until the day that happens it sure is nice to have this teaser. All Krall fans will consider this a ""must-have""."
3,"Great, but many missed opportunities","This book's descriptions of Curitiba Brazil, and Kerala India are priceless, and unavailable most anywhere else. If you're not a botanist, the third of the book that talks about the reforestation of the U.S. may be a little tedious.What irks me is that this stuff is very important if we're serious about ""living lightly,"" but McKibben doesn't do such obvious things as include photos. The entire book could use a serious edit just for readability...Don't get me wrong; the book is definitely worth reading, especially for the account of Curitiba. We're deprived, here in the U.S., compared to those third-worlders.A real eye-opener about civic possibilities."
1,good luck,"This is a heads up for anyone interested, Ghost Gate is dubbed, there are no audio options. When I press play on the trailers it stops the dvd.You have been warned."
3,An o.k. book on a great car,"If you love the Vette it doesn't mean you will love the book. I like the detail in it but it's a little too slow for a fast car. The Author doesn't seem to have the enthusiasm for America's greatest sports car as most loyalists have. And I don't think he ever roasts the tires on his C5, either."
5,Could not put this book down,I have read most of the books written on the automobile industry and this has to be one of the best. I started reading it one saturday morning and did not put it down until late that night. Schefter makes you feel as if you are right there in the trenches at General Motors. The book is both informative and entertaining
4,Chicago (Eyewitness Travel Guide),This was fantistic since it also had 3-D maps and street guides. The maps are worth the price alone. MJR
3,Good reference book but not a great travel companion,"The book is a good source to give you an idea. people who use websites like travel adviser know how difficult it could be to get great ideas from such sites so you can get ideas from this book and plan your trip. Information on museums is sometimes far better than the museum websites and you'll know exactly what to seek and don't miss athing but in the field, it's not really helpful. Probably this book lacks a big and detailed folded map of chicago. I think for something around 7 bucks its a good guide but for 15 bucks its certainly overpriced."
1,how is this sustained?,"I really don't see how this approach sustains an organization. Now, one can question what form a ""church"" should have, but if it is one with professional staff, buildings and programs, I don't see how his approach helps a bit."
4,Reverent and Relevant,"At a time when the cultural relevancy of the Christian church is highly suspect and hypocrisy has become the new heresy, the idealism and imagination of ""Organic Church"" is both refreshing and encouraging. Neil's ability to reach back and draw us forward at the same time makes for a study that is both relevant and reverent. His vision for a ""church beyond"" poses the critical questions of our present condition. After reading through it's pages I felt as though God was giving us the nod towards a more natural and simple church expression. ""Organic Church"" will be a good read for anyone who holds close the belief in the royal priesthood of all believers."
5,Beware!!,"Be very careful when you read this book. This is not taught in church, nor is it taught in Bible schools. It is not taught in Christian books nor is it taught any where in America. Nope, this is a revolutionary way of doing church, one that is Biblical and organic in nature. (Thus, the title). Niel Cole does an excellent job showing what the purpose of the Church truly is. He also clearly shows how the way we do church here in America is ineffective.So beware, it will rock your world, if you let it."
5,Better and Better Each Year,This is my 6th year and I love each one more than the last - Jeanne - keep up the GREAT work!!
1,Hooker and Canned Heat,"I guess Hooker is not my kind of blues, nothing against it, though. Maybe I will take it to the gym with me today and maybe it will help me with my workout."
2,what about the new songs ???,"A big disapointment that the new tracks, which are all good songs are not included.when it first came out i thought they could have saved the new tracks for a future album and left it as live hits only cd, but they included the new songs and therefore they should have been included on the remastered version. Buy the original 2 cd set instead."
4,A Double Live from the Glam Slam!,"This double live features Poison's on-stage energy and a few new studio tracks high lighted by ""So Tell Me Why"". It also features a C.C. Deville solo and a Drum solo by none other than Rikki Rockett. Classic Poison...~Shadow~"

1,"The difference between ""How to Build A Deck"" & Architecture","I'll make it quick and simple. if your idea of a lucid dream is along the lines of going to a movie or a play, buy this book. If not, save your money. La Berge totally leaves out the spiritual aspect of lucid dreaming. Its the difference between How to Paint and art. He doesn't even mention archtypes and he refers to Ouspensky, Castenada and Jung, but I don't think he has even read any of their writings. He is shallow and boring. His theory of dreaming is outdated and largely based on Freud. Even if your an amateur this book is a waste of your time. Read Carlos Castenada's The Art Of Dreaming or Fred Wolf's The Dreaming Universe. The only thing in this book that helped me was the ""spinning"" technique. Maybe go into a bookstore read that and put it back on the shelf. Of course this is my opinion, I could be wrong."
4,Bikini Summer,Started out a bit slow and I was worried there was no story line but got more interesting. Top movie. Lots of naked bits but not too lame.
3,Had its moments,"When I saw the band name Sneaker Pimps I thought to myself who would name their band this? I was listening to ""Six Underground"" the very 1st song I ever heard and I liked it so I listened to more of the music and I thought to myself not bad. Kelli Dayton has a very soulful voice yet a bit to edgy, I am not saying shes bad but sometimes she sounds like a kid. Shes a good singer though. Chris Corner and Liam Howe wrote some very good songs.Chris Corner is a better singer then Kelli Dayton, I mean dont get me wrong shes great but Corner was a bit better, this is a alright album so I gave it a 3."
2,"so-so, disappointing, swanky, dry on music","I really enjoy 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar, don't get me wrong. Those are great songs to have!! The rest of this CD was a big disappointment. It is unusual for me to prefer ""radio"" songs over the rest of an artist's offerings since the latter is typically more creative, in-depth, and genuine. However, for the rest of the album it appears that the Sneaker Pimps focused more on producing a sleazy, hiply dark image rather than making music. I was expecting a darkly sensual album when I bought this but the actual musical content leaves me hungry. In terms of a truly full album in this kind of popular music, Garbage easily performs better. If I could do it over again, I'd find the album and radio versions of 6 Underground and Spin Spin Sugar on singles or compilations instead."
5,excellent,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM VENDOR. ORDER RECEIVED WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF ORDER. WILL USE THIS VENDOR AGAIN AND WILL RECOMMEND TO OTHERS
1,Hard to install,"I had Suse linux for many years. I deceided to try Mandrake Discovery, because my old Suse linux disk would not work on Windows XP. I wish I had bought a new Suse disk that would work on Windows XP, because Mandrake Discovery will not install on either of my computers.I recommend Suse instead of Mandrake. I know it is easy to intall and it is very easy to use."
4,Not just a reprint,"InProgramming in Lua, Second EditionRoberto does a very good job of balancing the introduction of the language to the new Lua programmer, while keeping it interesting for the seasoned Lua programmer.He points out clearly where a feature being discussed is only available in the newest versions of the language and still instills confidence that the book you are reading will be relevant as the language grows.Coverage of the language and how to integrate with C is very through, although it would benefit the book to have a few larger, more complex, programming examples to give a feel for Lua in the large.Overall I think it is a great introduction to the language and probably should be on every aspiring Lua programmers bookshelf (if it already isn't)."
1,LOSER -- POS -- DON'T BUY,"1. NO INSTRUCTIONS.2. SCREWS TOO SHORT to go through both rack stay and bike frame member.Can't be used to mount the rack! Unbeleivable pain in the A__!3. THIS DOES NOT FIT ADULT-SIZE BIKES WITH TYPICAL MT. BIKE STYLE FRAME!The bracket provided is not long enough to reach the seat post area forattachment, unless you tilt the rack forward so much that it's angledlike 30 degrees from the horizontal!! You'll have to go to Home Depotfor new screws and brackets if you really want the hassle of installingthis sucker ""creatively"". My advice: SKIP IT, go to the local bikeshop for something you can tell will work, and which has properhardware and instructions."
4,Great buy!,"This fit nearly perfectly on my early 80's Schwinn cruiser. I read about several people having to make big modifications. Luckily I only had to bend the metal bracket that connects to the rear breaks and get my own long bolts to attach to the break harness. Not too much work. Someone else mentioned the instructions were hard to follow... what instructions? I actually had to go online and review pictures of the rack on bikes to get a visual to how if fit. That part didn't bug me because I probably wouldn't have followed the instructions anyway... I am a guy. For the price and the quality, it was well worth it. The Panniers we bought fit perfect."
3,Missing parts but works well,"I have a Schwinn Mountain bike and wanted a rear rack. This works fine on my bike. Originally I was going to put it on an older Husky I had but the rack would not install on it since the brake lines got in the way. The problem is my rack came missing 2 screws and 2 nuts. Luckily I have a lot of spare nuts and bolts around the garage so I was able to find something to fit it. Yet, it was offensive to have to do this. Also, this comes with no instructions at all, which was not a problem for me, I actually used some pictures on Amazon to see if I was installing it right. So far so good with the rack though, I have used it to strap some grocceries on and it has done well on my bike for the past couple weeks so far."
2,Sent it back,Looked great but the back of my bike is too wide and the unit could not be installed. I sent it back and was charged shipping
3,rear bike rack,"OK for the price. I wouldn't trust it with a big load, but fine to hold a jacket, lunch box, gym bag, etc. The foreward bracket is very soft steel and will distort under med-heavy weight. Will require some CAREFUL bending to fit over wide, cruiser type fenders."
2,solid frame but doesn't fit my bike,"I got this rack for my daughter's Schwinn Roxie Cruiser. All hardware came with the bike but there were no instructions. I didn't need the instructions but like the other reviewers said, the main anchor bracket is too short to be used at all on this bike. The very small holes on the legs of the rack were too small to be used with the existing screws on the bike. I should have read the reviews before I bought this, I wouldn't have bought this one."
4,Just as Described...needs more description,"I know that bike racks don't have instructions, but come on....we need at least some specifications....what bikes it fits, which ones it doesn't. BTW ladies, it does NOT fit a Small Giant Cypress!!! :( I liked it a lot though...on to bike rack #3"
1,WORST CHILDS BOOK!!,"What in the world kind of book is this? There is absolutely no moral to the story. I'm not sure if it is to encourage farting or make kids actually like farting.All points are just wrong, like did farting cause a nuclear disaster with the green falling of the trees? I did not realize that elephants had bananas to shove up their noises. And the end is awful; just ending with the fart moving to the next town.I hope that no one has the unfortunate task of reading this book and actually reading to to someone else.HORRIBLE!!!"
5,Chocolate Chip Granola Bars,"A great idea for when you're on-the-go, and don't want to/have time to stop. I just throw one in my bag, and I know I won't be stranded with low blood sugar. Keeps me out of the junk-food drive-thru."
3,mccartney re-visits some old favourites,"Many critics, in knee jerk mode, reflexively hailed this album as ""the best McCartney album in years"" when it came out...I beg to differ. Aside from standout cuts like ""Kansas City"", ""Lucille"",""Just Because"" and ""Don't Get Around Much Anymore"", this is an album that really doesn't reflect the person behind the big voice on top of the music. Maybe in 1964, with The Beatles backing him, could he pull off these tunes convincingly...but not with the band he has on this disc. Now, put George and Ringo with him, and it's likely a whole other story."
2,not heavy weight at all,I was disappointed in this towel set advertised as heavyweight. It looked to be WalMart type quality. I would have been better off buyingfrom Linens and Things.
5,title says it all,My kids had so much fun cutting these out! The designs were easy enough for them to do on their own. The hearts patterns made great valentines!
2,"""Advance"" means for DBAs Level","Ok...guys...I got this book today and I spend all day just to understand how I can apply available files on Author's web site by reading the text at the same time. It's very hard and complicated process!!!! Owww my god!!!! Text is nice, but files are horrible. The way author drives you through his material ... let me say easy: you have to possess some knowledge about SQL Server 2000 and SQL ,and Access ,and about many other aspects of software. Guys on the bottom are correct: this book covers some very comprehensive topics about Excel, but you less likely will use it, which probably most books don't!!!!! This is book for the Computer Science (DBAs) guys...not for people who want to learn some advance functions of Excel (book represent angle of DBA). Don't buy it if you not planning to become DBA or/and you are not DBA, but because I spend money on it I will keep it for the future, just in case. Who knows maybe life will drive to become one of them."
4,"Very good quick start guide, focused on reporting","This book is an excellent introduction to the reporting capabilities available in Excel. Prior to reading this book I had no idea that these capabilites existed. There is an assumption that you have access to a MS SQL Server for some of the content, but other than that I have no complaints."
4,Good math basis,"This book is pretty good. It is not a complete curriculum, but it does give good ideas on cementing math ideas in young minds."
4,family math for young children,"Family Math for Young Childrren was recommended by pre-school teacher, they use it in the classroom. Mom wanted it for home use as well. Excellent condition and should be helpful!!!!"
3,Original ska without original songs...,"This is a must-have album for any fan of ska music. However, this edition of ""This Is Ska"" lacks one song I've been looking for: My Boy Lollipop from Millie Small. This track was on the original release that I bought back in the late nineties. A friend of mine borrowed it and of course, the CD never went back where it belongs. So I have to reorder it and was very disappointed to realize that the tracklist wasn't the same."
2,"Great...If you liked Naked Gun, but with ATTITUDE!!!!","Directed by C. Thomas Howell. Unfortunately this movie will disappoint you if you watch it with the expectation the trailer's convey. The previews show this movie as an intense action packed movie, but what you actually get is something like the Naked Gun trio but with lots of attitude and intensity.The comedy element overpowers the intensity thus this movie does not even come off like the Lethal Weapon movie which injected comedy into it's drama/suspence/action. Again this comes off like Naked Gun with attitude. Better described: Naked Gun meets Lethal Weapon. With that in mind, you should find this a good buy/rent if you keep those things in mind."
3,teri ann linn and leon a joy to watch. marcus chong too.,"a campy movie that tries to be stylish and action-packed. the gangster theme sours the whole project. now, exactly why does becky (teri ann linn) decide she likes johnie (c.t. howell)? just because he took the fall for his pals? it would take monumental acting to make this scene believable! at least we get to see some of this pretty-eyed beauty, and in tastefully semi-nude scenes, too! it's a decent effort, like a good made-for-tv movie. teri ann linn should make more movies cause she looks great in a close-up, her voice is honestly appealing, and she moves with a modern grace. leon is excellent to watch, too."
2,Wholesale Mediocrity,"I bought this album expecting Beatnuts-type stuff. I wanted sharp, aggressive, smart, unique music. This is almost worse than if it were Master-P, in that at least he has a recognizable style that he's developed. This is boring in the same way that the solo Wu-Tang efforts of recent vintage have been. These guys might as well be from Hackensack N.J. or from Omaha or Idaho. Totally generic stuff."
5,U.S. Rulers Lost . . .,"For those swayed by the surface appearance of things and the propaganda of U.S. rulers, this title may appear out of this world. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of pretense by current leaders of Russia and other former European ""socialist"" states of being the heirs of Lenin and the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the U.S. military seemingly unchallenged - - where is the evidence that the U.S. lost the cold war?Read this book and you will find the answer. I will give you a hint: capitalism has not been restored in Russia or Eastern Europe. Cuba's unblemished revolutionary example and other genuine communists will have an easier time influencing today's fighters for liberation."
1,old book,"had no idea this book had been in print so long. After seeing the bronze statues in the park on a trip to Boston, I ordered the book as a gift for our seven year old granddaughter for Christmas. I was not happy at the appearance or the ""musty"" smell of this old book, but the seller will not take it back. I am trying to get the smell out of the book with baking soda, I will just give our granddaughter the book when it smells better, but not as a gift.Buyers, be careful when ordering used books, I hope you are not as unhappy as I am with this purchase."
4,"A great classic, especially for kids living in Boston!","This is a great classic! It is especially fun for kids that live in the Boston area. I read this as a kid, and enjoy reading it to my baby!"
5,"Timeless Story, a must for any parent's library","This story is timeless, as is the message of parental love. Every parent should have a copy of this and read it to their children."
1,Un happy customer !!,I had e trust installed on my computer when I purchased it. That was a year ago. I have had a reminder come through to me to say my protection was about to expire. 2 days before the expiry date I purchased another on line system with a fire wall. It cost me $49.99.I paid and the payment was accepted. I was told that I would receive an e mail and down load instructions. That was nearly 2 weeks ago. My time has lasped I have no protection on my computer and I have lost $49.99. Am I impressed NO !!! I am not. Do I need help ? Yes ! I do !!Silly thing is I am still being reminded that my protection is about to laspe. I need some answers ! And I need them now !!!!
1,sex in nicole of prie mer,"I have been a big fan of Robin Hardy books for over a decade and I was so excited to see she had continued the Lystra series. I was so let down after reading this ""Christian"" book. Please be warned this is not appropriate for those who want to keep sexually pure thoughts. Robin has decided to write a book that depicts a wonderful marriage bed. She explains in her web site her mission to balance what the world is selling as sexually appealing. But this book needs a heavy warning on it as the Bible says "" think on these things..."". It is very hard to have a pure thought life after reading about what others are doing in thier bedrooms."
2,They can do better,"Piebald has the ability to be an amazing band, as they have demonstrated to the nth power on Sometimes, Lemons, and Venetian Blinds, but this album falls flat in many ways. Although it isn't terrible, and I do love David Lee Rock, it is an incredible disappointment for a Piebald album. I don't want to believe that the new members changed things, but they haven't shown me otherwise. If you listen carefully, they even seem to sometimes recycle lyrics...To sum up, Rock Revolution wouldn't be a bad ep for a lesser band, but its a disaster for Piebald"
5,THE INFALLIBLE WORD OF GOD,"We owned an earlier print of this book and wanted to find copies to give others. Arthur Pink is very deep, and some may tire of how he writes in such detail; however, if you take your time and go through it slowly, there is wonderful knowledge to find. If you already do not quite understand or haven't considered the Bible, itself, as proof it is God's infallible Word, this book may help you reach that conclusion. I believe the Lord has truly gifted Arthur Pink as a teacher."
5,excellent,i love these books on studying Gods word. i would highly recommend these to anyone teaching a small group on the Bible/ God bless
5,Fantastic,"Both the seller and the book purchased are fantastic. Book in new condition. Seller gave wonderful service, fast delivery. Highly recommended."
1,Disappointing,Item arrived and screen did not work. Manual was completely useless. Called tech service at Mintek and voice mailbox was full so could not leave a message.
2,Mintek 1815 failure.,"I have this unit for a few years. Eventually the battery would recharge, loose it charge in the middle of a DVD and then, moved onto the next stage when it would not work regardless if it was connected to a wall socket outlet. Thought about buying another battery, but after reading the reviews on battery failures, decided I'd go with a Sony. Sound quality and volumne was about average. When it was new it worked very well but apparently wore out quickly. I paid over $200 for this one."
3,Useful on the Margins,"I have used the book for looking up the aorist form of verbs as needed in drills.The book is minimalist. Room on the pages would have been ample to include furtherdetails e.g. which declensions are associated with any given verb. Negative forms of theverb are not included in the conjugations of the 201 chosen verbs.Finally, the font used is like that of an old typewriter -- dull and not veryeasy on the eyes. I wouldn't go running to buy this book but it commands a cheap pricetag commensurate with its marginal value."
1,Boring,"Though I have great respect for Queen Noor, this book was a hard read. It was all I could to get thru it. Very boring. Save your money - don't buy it."
2,A mix of writing and opinion,This book seems cold and shuts you out. Queen Noor is very biased against Israel and this becomes obvious in her very one-sided political and historical representations. She mentions interesting personal facts and never expand on her ideas or experiences. She name drops frequently and refuses to respect the privacy of many. She says how modest she is and personifies this by showing how interested the King was in her?!?! This book has many interesting points but is biased and barely worth ranting about its lack of quality
3,"Good information, if you can see past the agenda.","Take it for what it is - a one-sided narrative, grinding the Palistinian axe all the way. However, between the condemnations of Israel and the lionization of all things Hussein, there is a very interesting story being told. The history of the Israeli-Palistinian conflict is presented, and the facts are not 100% neglected - I learned much among the rhetoric. Still, it's amusing how the Queen presents every Israeli ""atrocity"" as unprovoked and undeserved. For me, it was an interesting chance to hear the other side of the story, and gain some understanding of the Palestinian mindset. Even if it ignores salient facts and destorts even more, this is the story that the Palistinian youths are told - it's no wonder they are predisposed against Israel!"
1,A Queen of a Country in Which Jews Can't Own Land,"Before anyone gets misty eyed over the tender sensibilities of this lady, remember, that during the reign of her late husband through today, Jews are not allowed to own land in Jordan. The legal rights of people are restricted due to their religious beliefs."
1,Abominable,Within the first pages I knew this was a boring account of what must have been an interesting life. After page 37 I called it quits. Why struggle through it when there are so many great books to read? Her writing reflects her demeanor in interviews. Guarded. Expressionless. Unemotional. DO NOT waste your time on this. It stinks.
2,Politically inclined,It seems that the entire book is trying to convey her political beliefs. I thought it would be about her life only - which sounds so interesting but there's too many politically inclined comments.
2,I really wanted to like this book,"Had the book been less about her husband and more about her (who is, supposedly, the subject of the book), it might have helped. However, the book's overwhelming liability is the fact that it's obviously written by a press secretary. Try as one might, one can't curl up with a good press release. Noor is still young and her life will undoubtedly yield another memoir; let's hope that this one will be written by a voice more like hers."
3,A Political Wife,"I truly looked forward to reading this book to experience the viewpoint of a person raised in the American culture, but transported to the Arab world with a very unique vantage point. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this regard. With the exception of some personal naratives, I have come away with the impression that the book was definitely a party-line narative, with personal naratives added to entice readers. Keeping this in mind, it is interesting reading.Queen Noor describes a meeting she had with Barbara Bush during the Gulf War: ""I tried to explain the mounting concern in the Arab world about Iraqi civilian losses and desperate conditions. Mrs. Bush was unmoved. She was a political wife, and she was going to believe what she needed to believe."" As was Queen Noor."
1,Is This Woman for Real?,"I started to read this book today (only paid 75 cents for it at a used bookstore) and began to skip a lot of it because, rather than write about her life as Queen of Jordan, she wrote politics. I found her anti-Israel bias offensive.I don't believe she was as coy as she pretends to be about marrying Hussein.I doubt that I'll read the whole book. As one other reviewer states, it appears to be completely self-serving, full of jaundiced opinions and, on top of that, not very interesting."
1,A VERY DIFFICULT READ,"I found this book to be a very difficult read. The style of writing just does not flow well, and that is the least of my complaints.This book seems to be more about the history of Jordan, and very little to do with Noor herself.I was a little surprised at the uncalled for pot shots at the United States. She was born and raised an American. I understand she has a roll to play as a public figure, and I felt she was still playing that roll as a writer. I didn't feel that the book was very honestly written.In the end I think the book is more about her being a CHEERLEADER for the Arab cause, and her attempts to persude people to see them as the victims in the Mideast, and for most of us that is to hard a sell. Anyone who knows anything about the Mideast conflict, can see the obvious bias in this book, with regards to facts and events involving the Middle East."
3,typical steel book,"It's a good read, but very predictable especially if you've read a couple of danielle steel's books before. The Russian dynasty storyline was pretty interesting though. It actually inspired me to do some research on the Romanovs, which I knew little about initially. Based in both WWI and WWII, which is a time period I like to read about. Typical riches-to-rags-to-riches story."
4,Laid back,"This whole album is nothing but undertones. This album is very quiet (if you listen to it you'll understand). It is not %100 ambient. I wouldn't even know how to describe it because I have heard nothing like it other than his other album, Consumed (although a little quieter). I listen to this when I want some background noise, ie sleeping and working.I hope my brief review didn't sound negative, because I do like this album."
1,Poor quality.,"I bought this CD for the track ""Isrealites"" and the audio quality is terrible on this song. I have not had a chance to listen to the rest of it."
2,I was really excited to get to try ...,"I was really excited to get to try this product, as I'd heard a lot of good things. Unfortunately, I didn't experience any marked difference in my energy level. I felt as though I hadn't really taken anything at all. One good thing about this product is that I know that everything in it is healthy even though I didn't feel a difference."
4,Simple Wisdom!,"A fun story, quick reading, humorous, yet full of depth. A refreshing novel filled with simple wisdom!"
5,"DITTO! a ""perfect"" book","This is the book that first turned me on to Diane Farr and I'm so glad I found it. I agree with the reviewers below who called it perfect. It's my favorite romance EVER and Lord Rival, the hero, is to die for. I could go on and on but it might spoil the book for you and that would be a shame. BUY THIS BOOK, you won't be sorry. Lord Rival is introduced in an earlier, smaller book called Falling for Chloe but you don't have to read it first. Also he makes a cameo appearence in Duel of Hearts but altho Duel of Hearts came out *after* The Fortune Hunter, it takes place several years before, so don't it throw you if the delicious Lord Rival seems a bit .. uh .. .plastered and out of control. LOL."
3,it's ok,Would probably be useful if started around 6 months old. My daughter already knew all the words in the movie when I got it. Not a very exciting movie and she gets bored with it easily (she doesn't usually get bored with a movie even if she knows everything in it).
3,Very Good movie,Will add this movie to my collections of old movies. Book arrived as ordered!! This book arrived on time and in very good order!!
2,Could of been better.,"This J-Horror flick could of been better, it had such an interesting premise. But the lead actress was cute."
1,Buggier than a porch light. Novice beware!,"This book is likely to frustrate true beginners. In attempting to work through the excercises, the C++ complier the authors recommend refused to compile the sample code. Two frustrating hours later pursuing solutions on the Borland web site, I managed to create two configuration files, edit my environmental variables, and finally get the code to compile. Such geek gymnastics are certainly beyond most ""beginners,"" and are likely to cause them to give up the whole idea of learning to code.Shame on Borland for providing a compiler that was apparently never beta tested on XP(!), and shame on Wrox for failing to provide adequate instructions. There are a few answers of varying quality and coherance on their forum, but you shouldn't have to resort to the forum to run the very first compiled program in the book.If you aren't familiar with how a compiler works BEFORE reading this book, you are likely to run aground sometime around Chapter 7. Save your money."
3,Sameoldstuff,The book is okay maybe a little dated; very similar to other books about beginning programing. It could have included more info on the different type of programing languages and why they are used for specific purposes.
5,Frightening,If you seek a quick fright then look no further than When the Wind Blows by John Saul. This little novel is typical John Saul which is all you need to know if you want to be scared silly. The story is truly frightening and you may very well find yourself looking over your shoulder as you climb the stairs at night or as you sit alone on a couch corner reading this nightmare of a novel. Saul just knows how to dig in there and scare the ever living bejesus out of his readers. This is why I continue to read his books. I can rely on him to entertain me with a good book that may very well scare me bad enough to sleep with the lights on. If you are looking for a fun fright then give this book a try and start shivering...
5,Elegant Flatware,"I have been looking for a reasonably-priced set of stainless eating utensils for quite some time. The low-end sets bend so easily you can barely cut butter with the knives. I trusted the Oneida name, and was not disappointed. The design is very simple -- no carving, no scrolls -- and the size and weight of the various pieces is very impressive. The serving fork and spoon are huge, and look really good in a big bowl at the table. I would buy this as a gift or recommend it to anyone looking for value for the money."
5,stainless flatware,this is truly a beautiful and well made product. forget discount store junk. these are heavy duty and a little larger than normal. all the things that add up to a great value!!
5,What a bargain!,"This is top-of-the-line flatware. I am very picky and want the heavy, good quality stuff. This is a steal at this price! ($32.50/Free shipping). Very nice set. Not flimsy or cheaply made."
5,Nikki Giovanni,Excellent combination of gospel music and spoken word from the authentic and non diluted of a poet master
4,Is growing on our son,"This has been an interesting gift for our 3rd grader. Of course, he wasn't as excited to open this on Christmas as his toy gifts, but it seems to be growing on him. During a couple recent driving trips, he took a break from watching DVDs and playing with his Legos to pick up the Flashmaster and work on some challenge games. He was happy to report his scores to us. In that regard, I think the Flashmaster will give him math practice he wouldn't normally have gotten, and the challenge/scoring aspect of it make it enjoyable for him to ""play"" with. Certainly a no lose purchase, and in our case, it looks like a win!"
4,Fashmaster crapped out,bought a unit for my daughter.The Bad Work less then 24hrs and display went--> dead unitThe Good Manufacturer- sending a new unit at no charge.
3,Why is the Download So incomplete,"Another reviewer wrote:2. Poor reproduction of graphics. In some cases, it's difficult to see what the authors are trying to represent. Several errors in Chapter 3 (""Blogger: Rollovers and Design Improvements"") make the examples very confusing. The book's editing left much to be desired--I found quite a few errors throughout the booI agree completely and WHY WEREN'T THE GRAPHICS INCLUDED IN THE COD E DOWNLOAD? That should have taken no additional effort and made everything a lot clearer!I buy lot's of WROX books, so let's keep after them when they shortchange us like this."
1,"Not this one, turn around and run","I own no less than four Hindi-English dictionaries. Why so many? Because I bought this one first. It is hard to read, has many useless words and is missing some fairly common words. If you really need one, get The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary. It isn't both ways, but if you need both, then also find An English-Hindi Dictionary by Father Camille Bulcke."
1,Tribute?,"How can an album be a tribute with so many cuts with awful, weak vocals? My first time through, I thought each song got progressively worse. Born on the Bayou is instrumental which works, but the vocal part where they echo ""Born on the Bayou"" is a hoot. But on my second listen I found a couple of gems, Have you seen the Rain by Frog Holler, I have a soft spot for banjo, and Lookin out My Back Door by John Jorgenson features some mean pluckin, picken and fiddlin. Up Around the Bend is interesting until the guitar blows his amp at the end. The rest ranges from weak to pittyful. I can't reccomend this CD"
2,Religious Classics for Soprano,This product is somewhat disappointing. The Soprano's rendition of these classics leaves a lot to be desired and the tempos of the accompaniments are too slow
3,Somewhat Satisfied,"I purchased this book as a gift and contacted the seller regarding if the book was in good enough condition to provide as a gift and was given a roundabout answer. I received the book in a timely manner, but was not 100% satisfied with the description provided."
3,Math tales,"I'm not sure the intended audience of this book. The pictures are too minimal for early elementary, with content far above them. The grades for whom the content is appropriate would probably find the stories unappealing. They didn't catch my interest either. To its credit, the book has some interesting sidebars and activities for teacher use. My resources would not have been lacking if I'd passed on this purchase."
2,When I got the undergarments I had a ...,"When I got the undergarments I had a good laugh. They're so bulky and difficult to put on, and I end up looking like a giant New Year's Eve baby! I nearly fell over to see myself in the bathroom mirror. However, I can see how this undergarment would be very useful for bedridden folks -- they do seem very absorbent and long-lasting."
1,"Defective CD, strange songs","This CD was defective with all sorts of skips on all my CD players. It also has simply strange songs - not very good, in my opinion."
1,Don't waste your money!,The directions in the book are confusing. Unless you have LOT of time to devote to deciphering what they are telling you to do you'll never be able to figure it out.
1,Item undelivered,".... this item I purchased over one month ago has not yet arrived - please advise status and recourse ASAP, thanks... Ernst Wolfinger"
5,An amazing story about a regular family,"Believing he's directly responsible for the deaths of his brother and sister-in-law, 19-year-old Ian takes on the responsibility of raising his infant niece and two young stepchildren. He grounds the children in his newfound faith, courtesy of a strange Church of the Second Chance. But as the years pass, Ian learns that despite sacrificing his own life for theirs, his nieces and nephew will stubbornly insist upon being the people they ultimately want to be -- leaving Ian to realize that his own life may have been empty and meaningless by comparison.As always, Tyler's descriptions of regular people living regular lives are flawless and compelling."
4,A moral novel,This novel truly tests your morals. Anne Tyler makes the novel flow with emotion and believible senarios. The underlying themes jump out at the reader and create a basis for soal searching. Ian Bedloe is a universal character that everyone can relate to at some point in the novel. He is faced with challenges everyday that create his dynamic personality. Anne Tyler brings out the purest of human emotions through her characters and creates a wonderful reading experience.
1,Did I Miss Something?,"I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked. After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G. Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time. Sorry. I vote two thumbs down on this one."
1,Junk.,I've had this about a year. I don't recommend it. The hinge pieces that also hold the seat to the toilet never stay tight so the seat slides around all over the place. It's been that way since day 1. The chrome on the hinges must be super thin because now it's all pitted. And the camo pattern has bubbled and is peeling away from the seat in one spot.
4,Very Nice!,"""This seat is actually very ""pretty."" It has a very nice, smooth glossy finish. The only problem I found was that there were no screws included so fasten the seat directly to the toilet."
5,There are no words which could convey the degree to which this bar exceeds all others,"I have been an unapologetic connoisseur of health bars for over 6 years which is an integral part of part of my strategy to dominate the world, advance noble causes, etc, and I hereby declare that the flavor of this bar is jesus-jumping-on-a-pogostick-above-and-beyond that of any other health bar which exists. Seriously. Everything else pales in comparison. This bar has set a new standard. Congratulations to whoever is responsible for making this product available for my consumption and pleasure."
2,only like a few segments,"I bought this dvd mainly for the Fred and Fiona and Harry the Bunny. My son loves both of them, but doesn't care too much for the other stuff. I wish each show had it's own dvd."
1,Very disappointed with customer service from this company,"I received this tree on December 17th. I was home for delivery (it was sent as a gift) we unwrapped it immediately. The soil was very moist, almost soaking when I unwrapped it, so I did not water it again. Some of the leaves were starting to curl and blacken, but I assumed that was from shock. I emailed Brussels directly over that weekend and phoned them on the 21st. I have yet to receive a reply from either venue. The tree itself is now about dead, though we have it in direct sun and have been keeping the soil moist. Almost every leaf is blackened and curled/dried up. Very disappointed in their customer call back."
1,Not easy,"iGolf does not list a phone number? should have checkd that out, material states every course in USA nooo thats not true. When I final recieved mine because you can't check in the web site until you have a unit, which means you will not know if your favorite is mapped!!!Thats a frustration, also the support issue major problem, now I need to get this returned!!!"
5,STOP BEING RELIGIOUS!,"To the one reviewer: Prohecy, dreams ,visions and signs and wonders are part of the christian experience. John did not say that there would be no more prophecies after his. You need to read the bible for what it says not for what you think it says!This book was not intended to be an addition to the book of revelation nor did the author claim that it was. You need to lay aside your denominational prejudice. Call me @ (704)674-1507. To the other I say this: HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WORD ""ABBA"" MEANS? IT MEANS DADDY! It is very apropriate to call God ""daddy"". STOP BEING RELIGIOUS!"
5,Rememerig Wholeness,This is a life changing book. Everything that I have been searching for. You won't be dissapointed!
1,It was like ready White trash,It's the soap opera of the Arthur in all her books i was very disappointed. Dumbest thing i have ever read
4,Laugh out loud,"I enjoy humorous books, and short essays/stories tend to be where the action is (e.g., David Sedaris). I turned to this book after drudging through the first few chapters of a total downer, froofy female written book describing flowers and landscapes ad nauseum. This book had me literally laughing out loud. Even though I am not married and don't have kids (the general subject of many of the stories), I still identified with the stories and guffawed on cue. The book is also perfect for people who don't read very much, as you can breeze through a story or two and not have to remember some complicated character plot. Some reviews describe the writing as cynical, complaining, etc. However, if you are READY to see the humor in your own obsessions and social strife then check out this book."
3,oops,I think Season 8 will be remembered as the season Grey's jumped the shark. It's becoming boringly predictable. I'm hoping they can fix this once crisp and interesting show. Maybe bring another writer into the mix.
3,Losing interest.,The characters are all beginning to annoy me and I haven't even finished watching the season I purchased. That's all.
3,"Intriguing idea, clever dialogue,best beach book","The idea of a ""sex strike"" still seems totally implausible to me, but I enjoyed the look at Wall Street and the new feminists. Lauren Fontaine was just too perfect for me..brilliant, gorgeous, surrounded by the most wonderful friends one could have. I was reminded of the 1987 book ""Hot Flashes"" by Barbara Raskin. The romance in the novel seems to me to be the stuff of Harlequins: charismatic, handsome author immediately falls for Lauren..sex strike keeps them from consummation..misunderstandings, etc. I can still suggest it to our library patrons as a step above the usual bodice ripper."
1,not for a 3rd grader,"I bought this for my son to read to himself, but he was daunted by the length, so I read it to him. It was just too scary and weird for him, and even I found the plot difficult to follow, so we gave up on it."
5,16 inch hanging pots,"If your looking for a good size hanging pot, then this is for you. I bought 2 of these to transplant my ferns into and they are great. There is more than enough room for my ferns (which came out of a 10 inch pot) and plenty of room to grow."
2,Fell apart easily,"Bought two of these beauties. Love how they look but only two days after we hung them, one fell (rusty screw in the wall bracket) and the chain broke into lots of little pieces, making it useless. Disappointed."
2,Tepid Softcore - Par for the Course,"I saw this movie on Skinimax several years ago, in my formative days, and thought that it still might be SOMEWHAT boner-inducing. Wrong. The movie is bland and dispassionate with unnaturally staged sex scenes. The fake breasts are appalling. Overall, pretty lame."
3,"THE BEAUTIFUL BECKY MULLEN ""BUSTS OUT"" IN SINFUL INTRIGUE","BECKIE MULLEN(SALLY THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER/GLOW) IS STEPH, A LOVELY RICH INTERIOR DECOURATOR WHOSE PHILANDERING HUSBAND CAN'T MEET HER EMOTIONAL NEEDS AND SHE CAN'T GET INTO HIS ""GAMES""!

2,Doesn't look like the same type of ficus in the picture...,"A good price on this tree. But I was disappointed when it arrived. The trunk was awful--it was very bulbous/tuberous, and huge compared to the leaf portion. Just ugly. I called Brussel's directly and explained that I wasn't sure I had even received the same type of ficus I ordered. They promised to call me back, but didn't. I called Amazon, and they quickly placed an order for a replacement. I e-mailed Brussel's to let them know to expect a replacement order, and explained about the first plant. Didn't get a response, but the replacement plant was much the same. The roots/trunk were less bulbous and more compatible with the overall size of the tree. It wasn't quite as unattractive, but still didn't look like the same tree as displayed in the picture."
3,a little disappoint,It is too small than I can image. Seller should give a size description so that buyer won't be so disappint.
5,Beautiful Tree!,"I purchased my tree about a week ago, and I it came packed very nicely. The tree only had one leaf that turned yellow. It looked better than the picture honestly and I am a proud owner. I would recommend this tree!"
4,Pleased,"I haven't tried the techniques in the book, or read very far, but I do have to agree that gingham is a poor choice in fabric to use for a grid sloper. I have read the beginning of the book and skimmed through it and it seems very helpful. It's something I've been looking into for some time now. I'd like to make my own patterns and also I'd like to get commercial patterns to fit. This book focuses more on making your own patterns. I see it as I'm getting something out of this book, whether it be one tip or many, and that will add to my sewing knowledge. Plus for the price of about 6 bucks at the local bookstore, there's not much to frown about."
4,Frozen Attic Stars,"The Pastels meet Stereolab meet Kruder and Dorfmeister. Just listening to the Remote Star Climb Remix by John Mc Entire is a trip of its own. It starts like a poor man DJ Kicks session, The multifaceted songs wander far from their Homeland, then hurry back home. Could this be the best Pastels product since ""Up for a Bit"" or ""Suck on This"", probably no says the purist, but let me rewind Song #2 (which can be found on Kid Loco DJ Kicks album) and Play Remote Stars Climb until we all fall asleep on the couch. California 2001, or California 1964 ?"
3,"Poor sound quality, Not Chet in his highest form",This cd is good for the Chet fanatic (like myself) but I would not recommend it to those who are new to jazz. The sound quality (especially for the soloists) could definitely be better. Chet is not in his best form on this cd but overall it is a pretty good album.
1,"Decent graphics, sub-par sound effects, horrible controls","For a Jaguar game, this game had decent Virtua Racer-style graphics, with choppy animation the only negative aspect of the graphics. Sound effects are surprisingly dull. What really brings this game down are the horrible controls...steering is way too difficult to make this game enjoyable. This game had the potential to be one of the top Jaguar games, but the shoddy controls actually make it one of the worst Jaguar games."
3,I don't get it,"Sure, there are a few great scenes in this movie (like the flying eyeball, Ash vs. his hand, and the scene at the beginning with Ash's undead girlfriend), but overall, it's not nearly as funny as people say it is. And the scene with the laughing furniture has to be one of the dumbest in cinematic history. Dead Alive is much, MUCH more gory and hilarious."
4,More of less a remake than a sequal,"The begining of the film is a remake of Ash & his girlfriend. It doesn't include any other characters that where in the first one. Before I saw ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn,"" I saw film clips of it on a show on The Discovery Channel about horror films. The scene I saw on that show that was not in the theactrical release is after ash chops his hand off, the hand jumps up and chokes him."
5,Evil Dead 2,What a tour-de-force of outrageous gore and high comedy. Bruce Campbell puts in what can only be described as a brilliant performance. What is the point of remaking the first film - this is. It take all the best bits of the first film (whcih is also amazing) and adds so much more. I never tire of this film!
3,FUNNY AS HELL!,"This was the corniest, cheesiest, and stupidest horror movie ever made, but it was hickarious."
5,One of the best cult films in the entire universe!,"I'm quite sure that the adulation I hold for ""Evil Dead II"" will be redundant in lieu of the overwhelimng list of rave Amazon reviews, but I don't care! Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were downright geniuses when producing this remake (yes remake, not sequel) of the original Evil Dead film that I thought was a dismal dud. For the most part, I definitely don't revere this pic from a horror mindset, but from an insanely-funny screwball comedy perspective! Campbell's ""Ash"" gives such an indellible performance complete with tour-de-force physical comedy (accompanied with mean chainsaw, sawed-off shotgun, and Peter Deming's zany cinematography) and one-liners that will melt away the Ebenezer in all of us! Sure, the acting's cheesy, the violence explicit, and the screaming near hilarious. But, ""Evil Dead II"" is truly one of the best-of-the-best in the B-horror movie realm (even Roger Ebert thought this flick was indeed GROOVY!)"
2,Evil dead II wax fest.,"I did a blind buy on the Blue ray version, and its a good thing that I'm a fan of the movie (but then who else would buy this in any format) because the DNR makes the faces smooth and washes out most of the detail, its so clean it looks unnatural. This should be a $10 catalog buy."
4,Cult classic Horror/Comedy? Git outta here!,"Evil Dead 2,D.B.D is a unique,albeit bizzare film I have trouble pigeonholing as a specificly themed movie.It kinda picks up where Evil Dead left off,kinda sorta,but the first was all horror,something akin to Blair Witch Project.This sequel will not only give you a shiver, but will make you laugh your socks off!Bruce Campbell once again returns as Nash,and the old house from hell are still there, but you quickly notice this one's different.The parts about the posessed room and the posessed hand are hilarious! If you want a serious movie with an engrossing,twisted plot,not here folks,but it sure is fun!"
4,Classic on Blu-ray,"Evil Dead II is a classic horror film with cartoony overtones. This is the predecessor to Army of Darkness.If you already own the DVD and are not a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies, it is hard to recommend the Blu-ray version simply for audio/video quality. The picture does seem brighter and more clear in high-def, but can be subtle during a good bit of the picture. Since much of it was filmed in the dark, it tends to look grainy at times. Daylight scenes look outstanding compared to the DVD though with the exception of the final sequence when Ash gets sent back to the medieval period. For some reason, that did not look too spectacular."
5,cousinpaco's top terrors: #8,"It's hard to say ""Evil Dead 2"" is all that scary, but it's definitely a lot of fun.While chock-full of gory zombie-violence, the main draw of ""Evil Dead 2"" is the hysterically over-the-top performance by Bruce Campbell. As the stalwart hero Ash, Campbell abandons the straight-faced terror of the first film and goes right for the diaphragm. His jut-jawed bravado elevates this film from standard horror-fare to true classic. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the original, and it's more enjoyable for it.The blood-and-guts quotient is lavishly high - but it's too bad that the distributor mandated cutting some of the gorier scenes to avoid an X rating (they aren't even included on the DVD).As if the movie itself weren't enough, the DVD features one of the most entertaining commentary tracks on the market. All participants are affable and informative. It's like watching with a bunch of your buddies--and they just happen to be the ones who made the movie!"
4,Comically Horrifying!!!,"I must say I actually saw Evil Dead 2 before I saw the original Evil Dead. Evil Dead 2 is an absolute must see for fans of blood and gore. The blood and gore in this movie is Extreme to the max and will leave you screaming for more. Evil Dead 2 is just as funny as it is scary. It does not have much of a plot as Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend drive to a secluded cabin in the middle of nowhere. Ash plays a tape and unleashes the evil dead. He and his girlfriend are then stalked by menacing demons and inanimate objects that come to life. What a great excuse to throw blood and gore all over the screen. Even though I've talked to people that say it's a stupid movie I believe Evil Dead 2 (Dead By Dawn) is clever, comical and outlandishly terrifying. If your not looking for an intriguing and interesting plot, but looking for plenty terrifying visuals , great special effects and GORE this is your film."
2,Very Dissapointed!,"I've seen Army of Darkness so many times....And I've never saw Evil Dead, or Evil Dead 2. I figuered that since Army of Darkness had grown to be one of my favorite movies ever that this one would be cool as well. In fact I came here first to read customer reviews....Most of them seemed to say best out of the 3 movies! Well, I say thats a lie! Evil Dead 2, had very little dialouge, the acting was like as good as Army of Darkness, and it wasnt nearly as funny."
