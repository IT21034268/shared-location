4,"Works great, but not for a texture-bottomed tub","This product works great to keep baby from slipping in the tub. It was hard to find, as it appears many stores don't sell this item anymore. I had one 13 years ago with my first baby and loved it. The only thing is that it will not stick in a tub that has any kind of non-slip texture (due to the suction cups not being able to hold). Baby's weight keeps it secure while there's water in the tub, but if she lunges after the water level has gone down, the whole thing tips over. Not good if you're not paying absolute attention (which parents should be anyway while their baby is in the tub).It is easy to get baby in and out (my baby is 25 pounds, with chubby legs) and the little toys in front occupy her enough to get the bath done without her getting bored."
3,Eh,"I had been looking for a product like this for a while now and I was very excited to receive this one....until I used it with my son. My son slides all around in it and it does not stay stuck to the bottom of the bathtub. Also it's not very roomy, meaning it's hard to get to his body to wash him while he is sitting in it. I end up taking him out to wash his body, so why bother putting him in it in the first place. I've had a product like this before with my first child and it was much more open than this one. I would not recommend this product."
3,its ok,"I have 4 children, the youngest of which is 6 months and the oldest 12 years. I had a differnt brand of this chair for the previouse 3, but it finally wore out and i had to get a new one. This chair does the trick, but it isnt as good of product. I certainly wont expect this to last over a decade like my last one. The top pops off the bars and teh suction cups do not hold as firm as i was used too. It is functional, you just have to be more careful."
3,Not for active children,"I bought this seat when my little monkey kept crawling out of the infant tub. Then, when it arrived, the package insert said ""do not use this product once child can pull up to standing."" I'm unclear when you would need to use this product then... If your child is not able to sit up, this product wouldn't be able to hold them up and you would have to use an infant tub. If your child is sitting but not pulling up, then bathing them is probably pretty easy. I have friends who use this if their child is pulling up/walking etc but not overly active and it works for them. If you have a very active child and have a hard time getting them to sit still, this is not a product that will help with that and is actually dangerous to use in that scenario. I have only tried to use this once, but I will keep it for possible future children who may be less like a little monkey :-)"
1,Hits baby's private areas,"A friend gave me the seat that she used for her daughter; glad I didn't spend the money on it myself. First and most importantly, when my daughter (who can sit on her own) was in it she immediately slid around in it and seemed to land so her little girl parts were racked by the center 'bar'. Completely unacceptable. Seems that if they have to put that center bar there they would make the seat with a more gripping surface or tilt it to the rear just a bit. Also, this seat is designed for modern plastic tubs. Does fine in the one tub in my home, but wont stick to the old clawfoot tub and the tub bottom is too curved for it."
1,Scratches all over both babies!,"My neice used this seat and my sis-in-law loved it, so I bought one for my daughter. She ended up with scratches on her legs that she received from this chair when trying to reach out for toys floating in the tub. I put the seat away for 2 years and tried it again on my son. After 1 use he recoved a huge scratch on his thigh!! Maybe I just received a faulty one, but I felt complelled to submit a review. I am now looking for an alternative seat for my boy (who is 8 month old)."
4,Interesting and thoughtful,"This was a very interesting book about people who make all the wrong choices.Very human and real. The characters reminded me of those in a classic historical novel, the kind of people who take a wrong turn and just continue on a self-destructive path. It makes you think long after you close the book."
4,Child talent at it`s best,"The Angel Who Fell From The Sky is a great book for a bed time story. Not only does it teach a strong moral lesson but I believe that it encourages children to chase their dreams because it was written by a third grader.Also it is an easy to read and short book but has a good point, which I think is encouraging to children. Plus the illistrations throughout the book publish a very life like interpretation of the story. For the heart of a childrens book is the pictures. I belive by just looking at the drawings one could tell what the story is about. I believe that this book is a must have in every childrens library and I think my kids will begin to memorize it because I will read it to them all the time."
2,Only for the hardcore Static-X fans...,"As the title says, this cd is only for the truely devoted of Static-X fans wishing to round out their collection. There are only a few tracks that can be seen as standouts (Deliver Me, Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment, and Anything But This) and the rest are either mediocre or just plain boring. However, most die hard fans, such as myself, will get a kick out of the songs and find it very interesting to see how the band has evolved from their earliest days."
5,Great Product!,"My fiance recently purchased this item as a gift for me, and its great. The sighting grid produces a ""fireball"" even in dim outdoor lighting. You'll want to get a pouch for it and pad it nicely, as it's actual glass and can break. a police/EMS pouch for latex gloves, padded with thin foam should work nicely. They are one of the best visual signaling devices available, and you can never use them up (unlike flares or batteries in strobe devices). For the price, you can't afford to not be without one."
4,Nice watch,"I like the watch itself; although the band is pretty stiff. After a month of use I expected it to loosen up, but it hasn't. I'll wear this from time to time, but not everyday like I had planned."
3,Good product but with limited scales,"This works great, but it would be better if your could personalize the scale instead of using the few ones the device has."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"This book is intended for graduate students and professors of Mathematics who knew the subjet well already. The author made the subject unnecessarily complicated and explanations of the concepts are not adequate for first year CS students. It is not a book to rely on for self-study unless you have plenty of time, other text books and basic background on the subject. Contrary to the preface, I believe, the author intended to show off his math knowledge without consideration for the people who wants to learn."
5,Simply Horowitz,"I wanted a good recording of the complete ""Kinderszenen"" by R. Schumann, and this CD filled the bill admirably. Many of these pieces sound simple, but they are actually not that simple to play well. Horowitz's readings, for me, are in many ways definitive. He doesn't show off, uses tempos that are just right, and brings these simple, beautiful little gems to life. ""Kreisleriana,"" the ""Arabesque,"" & the ""Tocatta"" are also deftly played and a pleasure to listen to."
4,Life saver...,Now I expected a lot out of this device and it did under deliver on my expectations HOWEVER it does exactly has it was designed. I have an Droid X and often burn down my batteries within 8-12 hours of use...this little baby keeps me going another 2-2.5 hours under continuous internet use when I don't have access to an electrical outlet. I recommend it only as a temporary back up. It's the perfect size though...so small yet gives me +2hours when my battery is almost dead.
2,Packaging Please,"Ordered 5 of these for Christmas gifts. All five arrived in little plastic baggies and no instructions. I would be embarrassed to give these as gifts, so I've just been giving them away to anyone that can use them. I ordered one earlier to check it out before buying multiples (from a different vendor), and that one came in full retail packaging. Product itself seems pretty good, though."
2,lights are joke,"The box itself is OK. But lights are a joke, definitely useless. Also the stand is not suitable for DSLR cameras."
3,HAS MID-1990S RE-RECORDINGS PLUS NEW SONGS,"Petula re-recorded some of her classic 60s songs for a THIRD time on this album as well as recording a few new songs. But be aware that these are not the original 1960s versions of her classics like ""Downtown."" Her original 1960s recordings are on CDs from Sanctuary/Castle in the UK, BMG and Hip-O/Universal in the US and BMG/Vogue and FGL/Anthologies from France."
5,Fantastic Set,"Just watched the first two discs of this set. What a trip down memory lane. This show was definitely before its time. I did not remember what great subjects were touted on this wonderful t.v. show, from Vietnam to teenage pregnancy to drug addiction and that's only within the first two discs! I was only 10 when I first watched this show. Being older now, I am amazed at what I took from this show at such a young age. Where is season two, or for that matter, the remainder of the seasons. Amazon, you absolutely need to come out with ALL of the seasons!"
4,old time tv,Good series that was a product of its time. The issues are old and familer as are the faces. OJ Simpson stars along with a lot of others. Clearly a well intentioned show.
5,Targets,Very good product for target practice. Affordably priced. Product as advertised and arrived on time. I would recommend these targets to serious or occasional shooters.
2,not too happy,"2 problems: Product impractical unless you also have a dedicated bluetooth headeset. I wanted to use the same one for my cell and landline. Not an issue with this product exactly, but an issue nonetheless.Other problem is more serious: It wants to unpair all the time and I can't keep a connection. Sometimes they can hear me but I can't hear the other side of the call. Sometimes a call will get dropped. This was discovered too late to return product, and all packaging is already been trashed. Now sits in a drawer."
2,good product TERRIBLE service,"Good headset for voice recognition. However, Theboom (Umevoice) has terrible customer service. I sent my mic in for repair almost a month ago. They are nice enough on the phone but have not gotten around to fixing or replacing the mic. They also do not return emails or phone calls. If you rely on this mic, beware."
2,The Boom and the iPhone,"I have had the Boom headset for a number of years, but I have had to stop using it due to an audio problem when using it with an iPhone 3GS. My headset was sent back to the manufacturer when it would not function at all with my iPhone. I was told that the problem was an improper impedance match between the two devices. When I got the headset back it functioned for a while, but then developed significant background noise (sort of a low static sound). It went back again, this time for about 6 weeks during which time it got a new microphone. It still has too much background noise and I have given up on using it with my phone. It's too bad, really, because I was quite happy with the Boom's performance prior to this. In fairness, Jeannie in customer service was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, another customer service rep I spoke with was totally useless. In the end, I cannot recommend the Boom (at least for an iPhone)."
1,No Clue,"The item arrived in a separate metalic envelope without any instructions. I plugged it into my computer. My computer didn't recognize it. I tried to install it through control panel and my computer didn't recognize it there either. It may work at my work site because my computer is newer there, but who knows. I don't recommend to the average computer software user."
3,hmmm,This book was written by my great-grandfather for his doctoral thesis at the University of Chicago.James B Eskridge IV
4,A fine performance of a popular work,"An overall energetic performance- but the Winter concerto is spectacularly so, with the first movement exploding off Stern's violin. The second has a certain lively tranquility and the third rounds it all off beautifully."
1,What's On This?,"Ah, here it is ... the ultimate mystery DVD! Hey, guys, how about a title or two; what is on this stealth DVD, ""Lassie Come Home"" or ""Murders of the Vampire Dwarf""? Any clues?"
5,Sad but convincing portrayal,"As the prior review notes, this is an insightful review of how people chose to forget and ignore. The movie convincingly examines plausible denial and how German people decided what happened, regardless of reality."
2,How to Build a Chopper,"Against the advice of the other reviewers, I bought this book anyway. I'm square in the middle of the intended audience: I want to build a custom bike from the ground up, and I have extensive mechanical skills. In fact, I learned more from the most recent issue of ""Hot Bike"" than from this amateurish piece.It's shallow, disorganized, and frustrating because it could have been so much more. In addition, it badly needed someone to proofread and edit it. Remus has to be the king of the run-on sentence. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"Sound quality is extremely poor with these speakers. Sounds as if whoever is speaking is standing in the middle of an empty room. Fortunately, they came free with a computer I purchased, otherwise I would be standing in the return line!"
5,Sophisticated Coloring,"This book is great for older kids and adults who enjoy taking their time coloring. It has lots of fine lines and small spaces to color. Most of the prints to color take up a large part of the sheet and there are even a few panorama sheets to color. For those of you with lots of patience, this coloring book should be very rewarding."
5,I love this book!,I love this book! I'm involved in early childhood education and recommend it to everyone. I have two friends who bought it and now I finally have my copy. I have a 12 & 16 year old and I've read A LOT of parenting books. This is the best so far!
1,Self Indulgent Claptrap,"I had to put this book down after sloughing through the long-winded introduction and making my way through a chapter and a half to realize, ""This guy's never going to stop talking about his own life and start talking about movies.""Author Jerome Shapiro seems to enjoy the sound of his own voice as he jaws on endlessly about his trips to Japan, semantic hurdles about the word ""apocalypse"" and other material that comes nowhere near what the premise of the book portends. Not recommended."
4,Wings of Madness is Brilliant,A fascinating recounting of a little-known life and significant participant in the invention of flight.
5,Must read for sailboat enthusiasts,Great story of a landlocked sea lover. His detailed exploits are inspiring and very entertaining. Very good book.
5,Finalist for Georgia Author of the Year,"When Charlene and Lewis Pope's car breaks down at Sabbath Creek, Georgia, the mother takes a room at the local, run-down motel, while the son learns about baseball and life from the motel's ninety-three-year-old owner, Truman Stroud. In the short course of a few summer weeks, Lewis practices his pitching and learns the valuable lesson of gaining control--and again, baseball imitates life. A simple, beautifully written, character-driven story that routinely and deftly avoids stereotypes in both character and situation. There are no easy answers in Sabbath Creek. Here is a sweet and charming novel that asks much of the reader. That is, it is not a summer read to lay aside and forget. You will return in your mind to Sabbath Creek for days after you have read the gentle philosophy of Judson Mitcham."
3,Adapter fits but didn't work for my controller,This adapter fit my game steering wheel controller and usb on my pc but Windows XP did not recognize the controller which is the only reason I purchased this item. It may work with a different controller but my Logitech Wingman gamer steering wheel controller. Maybe with an install disk it might work?
1,did not work !!!!!,received the adaptor cables (3) for a MS sidewinder pro/USB to game. The adaptors did not work. I reported this to Amazon but no one would or could not help. So I just thru them away and wrote off the expense.
1,Did not do the job for us; not recommended,"We needed to create a joystick port on our PC. We thought this cable would do the job (after all, that's what it's made for) but it did not and we grew frustrated. A simple $6 adapter from Radio Shack did the trick. I think the issue may have been due to our needing to connect an *analog* device to the joystick end of this cable and the cable's inability to perform the A/D conversion (which the RS cable in fact does). That said, I'm not sure why anyone would purchase this Belkin cable."
3,Disappointed,"I needed a adapter because my computer does not have a game port. I purchased this product hoping it would work with my steering wheel. Unfortunatly it did not. I did know that it said ""for Sidewinder"", but I hoped it would work for me. I am sure it is a great product for what it was made."
2,Instalantion Problems,I could not get this product to work. I think it needs some sofware to work. Don't buy if you don't know if it will work.
5,Jorgan stick finger pudding flicker,Go into Control Panel>Game ControllersClick on Add>Microsoft SideWinder(Auto Detect)Don't blame your computer illiteracy on Belkin.I can't believe someone said that Belkin and Microsoft don't have a driver for the 'adapter'...are you serious?
1,Didn't work on XP,Bought this device 1 week ago. When pluged into my XP Dell Inspiron it never was recognized. Contacted Belkin support and they claim the device is only windows Vista compatible. Somebody tested it on Vista? Amazon should warn about the compatibility issue of this product.
2,A little TOO deadpan for it's own good.,"I wanted to love this book... I really did. As a fanatic devotee of all things zombie related, this seemed like a slam dunk. The problem is that the book is written so dryly, that the deadpan humor that should be inherent in a title such as this is absent. Even more bothersome, is the repetition in the topics. That is : here's what to do on 10 different types of terrain when you're fleeing from zombies. Now here's what to do on those same types of terrain if you are hunting zombies. And again, same terrain, if you are establishing a stronghold. We get it... swamps suck.Is it a lousy read? No, not at all. I just feel it could have been so much more with a little more black humor and a little less repitition."
3,"Not funny, but...","When I picked up this book, I thought it would be a laugh-out-loud kind of book, judging from the subject matter and the back blurb. Trust me when I say the funniest parts of the book are condensed onto the back blurb.That doesn't make it a bad book. When I started reading, I got the eerie feeling Mr. Brooks kinda, sorta believes zombies are real. If not, he did a very good job of convincing his readers he thinks they exist. It could be his humor was very subtle, and he intentionally wrote it to be so utterly serious that it crosses the line to utterly silly. Maybe I just missed the line.This is a good book for the die-hard zombie fans. Don't buy it if you're looking for a quick read that will leave you gasping with laughter. But if you want to know how to survive the inevitable Class Four zombie invasion--and how to watch for the precursors leading up to it--you won't mind shilling out $$$ for this book."
1,Boring.,"I couldn't make it through this book -- it was BORING. I had assumed from the high ratings that it would be funny. Now I know why Saturday Night Live is failing.I have to research if I can ""return"" a downloaded Kindle."
3,A decent enough effort....,"but really, EVERYONE knows there is only one thing you need to know when it comes to facing off against the zombie hordes.Shotguns.Everything else is just gravy."
2,for zombie lovers,"i assumed that because this book has so many great reviews that it would be funny to non-zombie fans. it wasn't. its not like i hate zombies, some of my best friends are zombies...i got a quarter of the way through without laughing and quit."
4,worth it.,"If you are looking for a ways to deal with zombies, this book is for you. More than an interesting read. Worth it."
5,KILL!!! *zombies*,"Ok. even though you might not be able to practically put the skills learned in this book on a resume (unless you are applying at capcom) it is a very well written book. From a tactical stand point, many of the described survival and evasion techniques make sense and are very well thought out. Even if the zombies do not attack, learning the skills listed in the manual will acctually be good for you. Though the more 'practical' skills are not described all the way through, it is still a great read for any zombie fan out there."
1,Retarded,Wish i could rate this less than 1 star. Made it through the first couple chapters and realized Max is a tool and knows not what he speaks.
1,He made zombies boring,"I love zombie novels and I realize this is not a novel, but I don't get how this book was so popular. Let me say that his book ""world war Z"" is one of my favorites and I highly recommend this, but reading this book I felt..... well, I felt like I could have written this. The material is simply not interesting in the manner in which it is provided."
3,"Good enough for a ""guide book"".","Being a huge zombie-lover (in that they terrify me like nothing else) it was easy for me to enjoy this book despite its flaws. The flaws were small, but still enough so that I didn't give it the highest rating. I found that Brooks repeated himself a bit too much, and I found that he could have made certain passages a bit funnier, because there were points where I got bored over how serious some sections were. I also got bored with sections that didn't necessarily focus on zombies but in general survival.The last section, ""Recorded Attacks"" also did not entertain me that much. Mostly, I think, because I felt that some of the stories (not all, mind you) were too vague for me to feel interested in them.Anyway, it's a quick read, so it won't hurt anyone to invest a little time in it if they want to try it out. Recommended for all zombie-lovers out there."
5,Great how-to survival guide,"This was part of my nephew's birthday gift, along with a camping head lamp and an Xbox zombie killing game. I didn't know he is actually scared of zombies, and he won't play the video game. Buthe likes this book, and maybe it will help him overcome his fear!For anyone who is a fan of zombie movies, or who is genuinely convinced that zombies may be threat to our survival, this book should be in your collection. And you'll need a head lamp to keep both hands free for zombie killing. :-)"
5,Very well written dry black humor from Max Brooks,"You can clearly tell that Max Brooks has a very dry sense of humor after reading this book. I was nearly constantly amused when reading the book and impressed with the consistency and multi-leveled parody of survival guides (try reading parts of the Boy Scout or Army survival guides and you will appreciate Brooks writing style more). The book does include some useful planning tips for worse case scenarios such a massive earthquake or god forbid a nuclear weapon detonation.If you enjoy horror stories especially zombie stories, you will have a very enjoyable time and learn a bit about survival planning at the same time.A job very well done, Max!"
4,"My friends laugh, but when the Zombies come, they'll be sorry","I loved this book, its exactly what a ""survival guide"" should be like. It reads like its factual and heavily researched. Has to be one of the most interesting fictional works I've ever read.Some of my mates have teased me about owning this, my only reply to them is ""don't come crying to me when the zombies come"".Highly recommended to any Zombie or Parody survivial guide fan."
2,Boring.,Amusing at first but gets repetetive and boring pretty fast. The records of zombie attacks through history is the only thing that makes it even remotely readable.
5,Great book.,"This was my first zombie book and after reading it I was hooked in the genre,sadly when you read a great book in a specific subject the rest seem bad by comparison.After this one I went on a quest and bought almost every book about zombies out there, some good, some bad and some great, but this one is one of the best and it isn't even a story."
5,wonderful!,"I first borrowed this book from my friend who now hates me because I returned it 2 months later, instead of a week. I then went out to buy a copy. This book is amazingly written, but when reading it, you WILL fear the oncoming zombie apocolypse. Because this book is so realistic, I, among a few others have designed a set of protocols and even an organization against the zombies. It is all in fun of course, but even being serious, this book is PERFECT, especially for an adolescant boy who has made an obsession out of the Resident Evil series. This book has become my essential guide to life, and even my own mother, a relatively old, serious woman, stole it from my room and read it. I highly suggest this book to EVERYONE."
4,Fun read,Lots of info for that unfortunate day if it comes..... interesting read and enjoyed it. makes you think what would u do in some of those situations.
2,Seriously?,"I am a major zombie fan, in fact we get together with friends and have zombie role playing weekends.I picked up this book, thinking it would be funny and give some interesting advice.It gave the advice in a very unfunny way."
1,The zombie survival guide,"Awful! Total waste of time and money, would have sent back for credit if possible. Did not finish, most likely never will.The zombie survival guide"
3,Good book...,"I feel that this book was written in such a way that it was almost hard to read at times. Does have some interesting tid-bits of historical ""zombie attacks"".I believe Mr. Brooks has matured in his writing skills,which is evident by World War Z..."
5,i am a zombie prepper now,"For the critics who put this in the category of comedy. those people are going to be the first to die in the zombie apocylypse. i am prepared, are you"
3,"Not the best Tie, but OK.","While this this Tie Fighter may not be the best Tie Fighter ever released, its still pretty cool. Unlike some of the newer Star Wars vehicle releases, this Tie Fighter also includes a pilot. The mold is pretty basic and without allot of extra detail. The wings are also of the smaller variety, which is a downer. Pretty good piece if you can pick it up for the right price."
5,Perfect at the beach,"I have two nephews that live a block from the ocean. Bought one for each of them for Christmas, and it is now February and they are still a hit. All the kids on the block want to take the toys to the beach. Very durable in wet and sandy conditions."
2,Not what I expected,You have to be very near the car because of the low range that it has. Is not fast and in the water is much less potent.
2,Skip the CD and look for the audiocassette,"Lovely score in an analogue recording with Julia Migenes in fine voice. But only on audiocassette. The transfer to CD in the early 90's resulted in a shrill, unlistenable disc with volume levels zigzagging wildly. Only the cassette offers the recording's rewards."
2,A disappointment.,"I just could not get into this show. So many of Stephen Schwartz's shows are so accessable, and the music so involving that he is one of my favorite musical theater writers. I just couldn't sit through this soundtrack. And with one of the roles being executed by Terrence Mann (known for originating such great Broadway roles as The Rum Tum Tugger in CATS, The Beast in BEAUTY IN THE BEAST and Javert in LES MISEABLES). I was, in two words, thoroughly disappointed.I strongly recommend three of Schwartz's other works above this one: GODSPELL, PIPPIN & his great new musical CHILDREN OF EDEN."
5,Love this toy box!!,"I bought this over a year ago for my now 3 year old daughter. She loved it at first sight and goes perfectly in her ""princess"" room. It was relatively easy to put together and the safety hinge is great for not pinching little fingers. We have not had a problem with durability. I sit on it when I'm in my daughters room and I have even had my dad sit on it with no problems. My 3 year old and 17 month old get inside this thing with no problems of the bottom being flimsy. I would highly recommend this for any little girls room."
3,Good at times,"I find this biography to be very well written at times. God knows that mr. Daly has some interesting (at least) stories to tell! The writing engages and has an easy flow, but some times the whole flow kind of halts as the stories turn from good stories and anecdotes into blatant bragging... Maybe it's because I am not american that I react to this, but in my opinion, if you make a few well intended and much needed donations, you shouldn't need to write a book to brag about this. It should be enough just to feel good about yourself.Anyway, if you get this book at a fair price, buy it."
4,Real life on the golf tour,"Excellent presentation of how it really is on the tour during the early years, and the intervening years. The drugs, booze, women, and yes gambling."
4,putting it all out there,"I enjoyed reading this book. You feel for John. He's a good guy. Some of his unwanted drama is self-inflicted and some not. I can't imagine anyone to be as good as he is with all the distractions. Bottom line, he lives large and doesn't just amble through life."
1,Unfinished Round,"I'm an avid golfer an have always enjoyed watching John Daly golf, but I picked up my ball and left the book unfinished. The book is one long alcoholic denial, badly written, simplistic, and boring. I don't know why I assumed he was somewhat intelligent, but the autobio shows otherwise. Good thing he can golf or he would have died homeless on the street years ago. One needs to be drunk to read more than one hundred pages of this dribble, and me being a recovering alcoholic, I choose to stop. If John can't stop drinking, at least hopefully he can stop writing. {or at least get a ghostwriter that can write}"
1,OMG. WARNING WARNING. STAY AWAY. DO NOT BUY,"This is the worst skateboard or any other movie I have ever seen. The people giving this movie good reviews must be in it trying to sell DVDs. This should get a negative 100 stars. I WARN YOU, DO NOT BUY. EVERYTHING TOTALLY SUCKS ABOUT THIS DVD; THE TRICKS, CAMERA, MUSIC, PEOPLE and Ect."
1,not worth it.,It is not at all what the combination of the cover picture and the description lead you to believe. Not worth renting. Would give 0 stars if possible.
5,Perfect to hold Thigh highs up!,"This product is useful for any clothing that you want to stay in place! I put it around the band of rubber on my thigh highs and they stay up all day. No slouching down, no pulling them up! Comes off with soap and water. Fabulous!!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"FORTUNATELY, I tried this adhesive well before the main event and it did not hold a sheer scarf in place on upper arms or shoulders; and I could not wear the much prized strapless dress. None of these adhesive products that I have tried work! WHY???? i don't sweat and i have tried a normal amount and a large amount. Also i have applied it early as well as later; nothing works. I am fed up"
5,most wonderfull stuff to hold medical hose in place!!!!!,"the best thing to hold the job stocking up when they just will not stay!! my husband has to use this product & its just wonderfull,hard on pride , but when you get past that its just great!"
1,Doesn't work,"I have tried this product and I can't seem to get it to work, it's supposed to help clothing stick to skin."
5,thigh highs,"Nothing worse than wearing thigh hose and feeling them riding down your leg and there they are around your ankles. ""It Stays"" has solved the problem. Just put your hose on--roll down the top about 2 inches and apply the adhesive on your skin. Pull the top of the hose over the glue and you are set until you remove the hose. Great great product."
3,Maybe I need a learining curve?,"I bought this basically to help keep my thigh highs, spanks, and bra straps in place. So far i've only used them on the thigh highs. I applied liberally to my skin where i wanted the top of the thigh highs to stay and they kept rolling down all day anyway. I'm not giving up on the product yet I guess I just have to figure out how to work with it."
5,SUPERB Artist!!!,"This concert, clearly demonstrates an artist in his prime! Performing in front of an audience of fans and loyal followers, Alejandro hits all the emotional peaks, singing songs associated with his career as well as music set pieces he has performed often in concert. Well done on every level! A phenomenal performance captured for all time! Who could ask for anything more?!!"
2,disappointed,"We love Alejandro's music but I never finished watching this DVD. I'll sell it cheap to anyone interested. Just not nice to watch, and not sure why. He Entertainment value is close to zero, for both my wife and I.Sorry Alejandro...."
4,uh... okay i guess,This book was a little too brief. It showed good drawings of horses but it didn't break down the steps of drawing one like a good drawing book would. The materials they give you are great though. Hope you enjoy it.
2,O.K.,This book was not the best for me it made me want to draw but there was a problem it showed me but it just showed circles. I would recommened this book to people who have alot of calmness.
4,"religion aside, a very good read...couldn't put it down","I'm not at all religious, so that part of the story didn't effect me at all. The writing, though, is great...I couldn't put it down. I didn't see several elements coming, and really felt I knew the characters. My top book for the year."
1,Unrelenting Tedium,"This is one ponderous monster of a novel that lasts forever. There isn't a believeable person in the whole book. The women were all airheads looking to some pretty stupid men for guidance. Why couldn't the female savior at least have acted like she had a brain. I could buy the evil cardinals' cabal, but that confederacy of cartoon dunces just ended-up lame. There are too many long speeches, too many dumb parables, and too many pages where nothing happens. It finally limps to a conclusion that is a real dud. So many here have mentioned the bad writing that I won't mention it again, but I was shocked something like this was actually in hardcover briefly. It doesn't seem likely that even one of those vanity presses would put out gunk like this."
2,Dean Koontz Did Not Write This Stinker!,"After finally slogging through Last Day, I can't see any chance that Koontz wrote this miserable screed. This is clearly the work of a first-time hack trying desperately to sell books through controversy alone, not good story telling. Koontz writes with insight, intelligence, and style, elements this book seriously lacks. The dialogue and characters here are laughably overblown and dumb. The biggest reason Koontz could not have written this thing: he has talent and writes well. It would go against his nature to create a real load of junk like this."
2,Deepok?,"Basically mediocre thriller where bubble-headed New Age hokum is spouted for many pages by fish-tank bred feminist messiah. Someone has read too much Deepok Chopra. The new parables are a real hoot. A more intelligent philosophy can be learned from any Hyde Park sermonizer. When not pouring vitriol on the Catholics, the novel bores readers with the love lives of the stale characters. There's a lot going on and none of its very interesting. The concept of this novel is fascinating and one wonders what a good writer could do with it. Unfortunately, the knowledge and insight needed to tackle important issues is not in evidence here, nor the talent to tell a story."
2,Incredible,"Actually, I find the critical reviews for this book more than credible. When I read it a few months ago I thought it was a quick bit of fluff, although long and boring in stretches. The multiple star reviews are a bit odd but I guess this is great literature these days. The fact that some are offended personally by this book seems to bestow an undeserved significance to it that is as inappropriate as the rave reviews. It is difficult to get worked-up about a book that is neither terrible or terribly good. The reviewers defending the book find it necessary to do so in a personal way and that is quite curious. A review is simply an opinion and mine is as mixed as many. Read and enjoy."
2,Revolting Revelations,"Pretty stupid sendup of fundamentalist interpretation of Book of Revelations. Funny in part, but uninspired overall. The College of Cardinals are made to look dumber than they are (impossible) and as incapable of even discerning when the next millenium begins. Kleier is equally incapable of creating a single sympathetic character. I kept hoping the inept pope would stick a cork in her mouth and send her back to Patricia Ireland and N.O.W. Her groovy aphorisms were just too cute. And that sales figure from Publisher's Weekly (which panned this masterpiece) should read 1,500 copies sold, not _150,000_. Mr. Kleier has already presented this flat potboiler. No need, Glen, to cook anymore books."
2,Only my Opinion,"At the risk of incurring the wrath of the passionate admirers of this novel, I would like to say that I did not enjoy reading _The Last Day_ very much. I am slightly bemused by the vehemence with which an ordinary thriller is defended here and the strain of paranoia characterizing some of the favorable reviews. Surely we all should strive for a more open-minded tolerance of one another's opinion concerning a mere novel. Any criticism I have as to the quality of the author's quality of writing or intended message would only repeat the essence of what has already been stated in many of the negative reviews on this page. But I believe each of us should feel free to express our ideas without the personal condemnation and bizarre recriminations of any angst ridden faction with persecution delusions. It is, after all, only a novel."
2,Flash! I'm Not a Fanatic,"You really don't have to be a bible thumping member of the Falwell brigade to think this book is garbage. I know very little about the bible and I'm not Catholic, so take my opinion for what it's worth. This book is the longest, most boring, poorly written, and farfetched thriller/anti-religious diatribe I've read in years. The characters and dialogue are cartoon like. I believed the suspicious raves that appear on this page and wasted $20. If you have time to waste, buy it in paperback. But you are better off not bothering with this junk and ignoring some of the exagerated claims made here. My advice: check the reputable media for reviews AND the bestseller list for yourself."
2,OK Thriller,This is a fair thriller with too few thrills. Crude writing and tends to get preachy. The author is insensitive to religious folk and is pretty brutish in his disdain for Catholics. The science fiction angle is clumsy and the romance stupid. It's ok as a timekiller but not recommended for serious reading as it's too long for a lite read and too dumb to devote serious thought to.
1,Overblown Junk,"Too silly, too wordy, and too long. With writing like this, only the publisher could seriously say ""Kleier is a welcome literary voice"". There must be a hundred reviews here that point out how poorly written this nonsense is, but I found the author's hammering and yammering about other people's faiths tedious. The alternative he offers in Jeza, the feminist messiah from Malibu East, is superficial New Age pablum. Kleier needed remedial courses in writing, comparative religion, and science before embarking on this ludicrous effort. His mad scientist scenario creaks with age, his characters are flat. This is one piece of junk that I sincerely regret throwing my time away on."
2,Great Premise - Fair Novel,"There is certainly no way this book could possibly live-up to some of the over-the-top reviews here. The premise is great but the potential is poorly realized, the research soddy, and the writing is indeed terrible. Whoever wrote that the superbly challenging authors Stone and Morrow are ""safe"" has not read them and has a low standard for comparison of writers who question faith and organized religion. This novel is actually ""safe"" as it attempts to cling to stereotypes, stock characters, and very old prejudices. The author lacks true insight and belabors his point, repeatedly, too often, and too long. I ""got it"" well before the long delayed and predictable ending. If this is honestly such a masterpiece to some readers, good advice would be to read more and discover the fine writers who have approached the same ground with the intelligence this author lacks. There is great literature out there but this isn't close."
1,Nihilism+,"I don't expect those giving this book 10 to know what nihlism is, but what is found here is not offensive to organized faiths. The ignorance and arrogance of the author degrades feminism and Women's rights in general. By presenting a comical female saviour of such limited intellectual capacity, such low charisma, and such downright hatefulness (Jeza has attitude to burn), Klier just insults the reader. And yes, I am a feminist, but I'm only active when a male writer is this insensitive, stupid, and ugly towards more than women. This guy is just a bad writer and an idiot."
4,A Bit Tedious,I enjoyed parts of this book very much. The author is rather long-winded and it gets a bit tedious. I think the Jeza person could have been much better developed and the story researched more accurately. Awfully long for light reading and not even close as important literature.
2,"Interesting, but I've seen better.","The premise of Mr. Klier's story was a good one. Unfortunately, he did not execute it all that well. Parts of the story were exciting and tense and it held my interest for most of the book. The book starts out focusing on Biblical prophecy but in the end, totally disregards it. If a work of fiction references actual printed material, I feel it should remain true to that material. There was no mention of the Rapture, nor of Christ's (Jeza's) triumphant return with the saints. There was also no tribulation. Also, Jeza's sermons seemed a bit too 'New-Agey' for my taste. The messiah in the book does not in any way resemble what the Bible says about the return of the Messiah. Sorry, this book just didn't do anything for me."
1,What a Relief,"I read this novel with great anticipation. What a relief that I'm not alone in rating it so low. This is the worst thing I've read in years. Definitely not ""the best book I ever read."" I don't care if the Catholic Church gets skewered, but at least put the barbs in the context of an interesting and readable story.I recommend Damascus Gate by Robert Stone (available here at Amazon) for an excellent millenium novel about the Holy Land and the meaning of faith. Now that is a great novel."
2,Read Daniel Easterman,"New Age pop guru raised by scientists in an aquarium spouts pseudoreligious nonsense so shallow it's silly and saves humanity from Catholic Church! Promising thriller stumbles badly over faulty scriptural references and laughable Christ figure who demonizes organized religion and is so obnoxious one would prefer damnation to this sort of so-called redemption. Read any novel by DANIEL EASTERMAN for a far more credible, accurate, exciting, and satisfying religious thriller. This absurd trifle isn't close to being in the same league."
5,The truth is out!,"Anyone who, like me, is puzzling about the rash of odd, negative reviews this excellent novel has received need scratch their head no longer. Just click on the angst-filled ""reviews"" of 'David,' or 'Sellers69' or the 'reader from Berkley' below. You'll find they are all from the SAME PERSON. Amazingly, the same Christian militant has been writing in railing against this novel under assumed names virtually every day of his obsessive-compulsive life, filled with the self-righteous mission to save us all from this evil novel! The epitome of the stereotypical religious fanatic! Anything that doesn't subscribe to the fanatic's narrow-minded interpritations of scripture is heresy and subjected to sanctimonious wrath. For all the open-minded, sane people out there, The Last Day is one of the most provocative and well-written novels to challenge conventional religious thinking in years. For the religious nut who is so fixated on this novel, get a life!"
3,Fun Read,"I enjoyed this in spite of some rough writing and dumb dialogue. It's not meant to be theologically profound, just provoke thought and entertain. It seemed to do both to some degree. Lighten up! It made me chuckle."
5,An excellent book,"I must say that THE LAST DAY is a very intelligent and well-written story. I could not put it down, and I found its arguments unusually well developed and stimulating. I accept the fact that anytime a novel has the courage to address provocative issues, it may offend some tastes. This is not your typical novel. It tells one of the most original stories I've ever read, and it hits hard in the emotional midsection. In a positive way. I finished it feeling I'd read something very special. More than a thrilling story filled with the unexpected and fascinating, this book confronts a number of important and controversial issues in a most unique way. It's like getting two books for the price of one."
1,Thou Shalt Write,"And then the Great Publisher,sat down with the new Author,and said,""Thou shalt write an overly-long,politically-correct,biblically-ignorant,diatribe about the last days before the New Millennium.For there are many gullible, spiritually-starving people,who will read it and believe.And together we shall make lots of money.And he did."""
5,Great story!,Congratulations to Glenn Kleier! Terrific story! Took this novel with me on a business trip and didn't want to leave the plane! The suspense is excruciating and the action non-stop. Story takes you through a maze of experiences and places seen through the eyes of a TV reporter cuaght up in the ride of his life. The Jeza character is easily one of the most stunning creations I've come across in years. Her mind is brilliant and the twists and turns and surprises she takes you through is like having your soul strapped to a roller coaster. When's the next book?
2,Great Idea,"The idea that the messiah might return in the form of a woman is a fascinating one. As I was finishing this novel last night, I couldn't help thinking that the idea was squandered in a dumb thriller. A more capable writer could have brought such a character to life, explored a myriad of possibilities. Instead, heres a female messiah al a Gloria Allred, more a obnoxious fundamentalist who just finished the Classics Illustrated version of St. John than a christ. This is got to be the most ridiculous dialog I've read in years and certainly the worst researched thriller around. What a waste of a good idea."
2,Millenial Junk Food,"The end of the millenium is bound to attract the attention of many writers and there is an opportunity for a great book. This is not that book. The story here is pretty thin and its background is poorly researched. The author seems to have little understanding of his subject and his interpretation of church history, the bible, and Israeli politics is laughable. Some of the errors could have been caught by a good editor, which this novel needed badly. The result is a ponderous, silly, and superficial book that leaves the reader craving something more substantial."
3,Holy Smoke!,"This is a pretty average thriller. I kept hoping the Pope would slap some sense into this misguided ""savior."" Instead, the Pope loses on a technicality! Oops! Wrong year it seems. I agree that Easterman is the master of this religious thriller genre. This story will have most readers cheering for the anti- christ. I hope when Christ returns He will know a little more about the Bible than the airhead depicted in this book."
2,Lenten Sacrifice,"Having finally finished Mr. Kleier's turgid tome, I will now offer up the pain I endured reading it and hours lost trudging to it's inane conclusion as part of my Lenten sacrifice. I don't think I have before encountered such misleading positive reviews. As a book editor, I encounter bad writing often. This, however, sets a new low for publishing. It is certainly in my top ten worst books of the past five years. I've read better dialogue in the bubbles above Superman's head. The plot idea gets a 3; plot execution (now that's appropriate) a -10. Jeza save book editors from ""authors"" who are as pretentious as they are talentless."
5,An important novel,"I loved it. This novel definitely has something very topical and contemporary to say to the many stodgy, paternalistic religions out there. It should be required reading for every ecclesiast attempting to convey the ""word of God"" to anyone. An exceptionally well written, prescient and timely work that affected me deeply."
1,Misfire,"Unsuccessful as science fiction, thriller, or whatever else it's supposed to be. It's difficult to miss when your target is organized religion, but this ""author"" does a good job of it with some of the worst writing I've read in years. It appears that little research was done when this was tossed together. I didn't find it convincing at any point and the main challenge was actually finishing a book so redundant. My only problems with this book are that it's literary trash, not that it trashes religion. The right wing religious nuts may have problems with the latter, but I hate the former. I may be a free-thinker, but I do have taste:)"
5,A MUST for readers of the suspense thriller genre!,"Terrific plot! Realistic dialogue! Believable characters! Suspense in EVERY chapter! I'm in awe that a first time writer could create this novel! If you like intricate plotting, this writer is for YOU! If you like suspense thrillers, you will hate to put this novel down just to eat and sleep!"
2,"Wow! ""The Greatest Book Ever Written""?","Is there a joke here I'm missing? This and Furland's ""masterpiece of literature"" are the greatest books written in 5000 years? Let me catch my breath. This is more like The Hardy Boys meet Nancy Drew At the Apocalypse. If Franklin W. Dixon were a theologian and cultural observer, this would certainly be the case. Unfortunately, Kleier and Furland are now ""enlightening"" Mother Theresa! LOL! A big grain of salt for these reviews. Last Day neither expanded my mind or cured my sciatica, but then I'm not ""a professor of literature at a major university."" Mercy!"
3,Odd Reactions,"Wow! Some people get pretty defensive when this book receives an even sightly negative review. I can understand that happening as people don't read many serious books on religion or philosophy now days. It could be easy for some to mistake this average thriller for something substantial and profound because it focuses on an unfamiliar topic - the nature of divinity. But this is just a silly thriller, ineptly researched and poorly written. There are many like this, although this is more pretentious than most. The author obviously set out to push some buttons and succeeded to a degree. The best characters I've encountered in fiction?? An important book?? Seriously? Does anyone have some point of reference based in reality? This is the sort of book that was published as a paperback original before the post-literate era began. Unbelievable and really very sad."
1,An anti-religion diatribe!,"The basic premises of this book are: (1) all organized religions are bad (particularly Roman Catholic); and (2) all the world's problems are caused by organized religion. Above the primary themes, Mr. Kleier has the new messiah preach a sermon of politically correct pablum: sleep around, have abortions, have a good time, but don't waste any time going to church. My best guess is that Mr. Kleier attended parochial school and hasn't been able to forget the nuns whose teaching so cruelly offended a sensitive 60s kind of guy. Nonetheless, Mr. Kleier doesn't waste a minute of his pulpit time to preach to us.As pure fantasy, this is a pretty well written book. It has an interesting premise, and a decent plot, with good charecterizations. But, even without the apparent anti-religion bias, the ending would be disappointing."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Klier","Why do some people seem to hate this novel for what it has to say? If you ask me, it is a welcome slice of reality masked in fiction that tells a marvelous tale. This book, if you peel away all the intriguing layers, is simply a parable. A parable that cleverly reveals the often greedy, materialistic, power-consolidating underbelly of modern religious structures--organizations with an established history of greed, materialism and power-consolidation. Mr. Klier strikes a credible note of warning, calling us to be vigilant against the vicissitudes all men are susceptible to, whether they wear their collars forward or backward. Simply a wonderful and spellbinding story with a relevant and poignant moral."
2,Below Average,"Two stars is generous, believe me, for this so called thriller because the writing, characters, and dialogue just made me cringe. I think that most of the bad reviews are right on and that for a great novel about the millenium you should do what many of the readers suggest: look up Robert Stone's Damascus Gate and order it from amazon.com. It's terrific and you won't feel your intelligence has been savaged by the mindless junk Last Day amounts to. Spare yourself some painful hours and read one of the finest novels of the last year instead."
2,I Don't See It,"I don't see how anyone could possibly consider this lackluster novel either well written or ""important."" Pretensious and pompous, definitely. Long, boring, and amateurish, correct you are. Insulting to women, Catholics, and Jews, indeed. Entertaining, enlightening, or worth one's time, not a chance. I expected more after reading this page's outstanding reviews and I absolutely ended up reading a very large, tedious piece of garbage with nothing to recommend it. Believe it or not my paranoid readers."
1,Art It Is Not,"This pretty bad writing and a waste of time as well. I'd recommend Daniel Easterman for a good religious thriller, James Morrow for cutting religious satire, and Robert Stone's Damascus Gate for an intelligent novel about the millenium phenomenem in the Holy Land. This author attempts all of the above for over 600 looong pages and fails because he lacks the skill, insight, and basic talent of those writers. The author is way over his head here and the result is pathetic nonsense not worthy of a comic book. Pure hype and tripe."
3,Hardly Great Literature,"An entertaining, dumb thriller - hardly a reference point for the next century.The author wastes time preaching and doesn't exactly write well (yikes! that dialog!) but it's an ""interesting"" book. A good editor would have probably saved the author from his own excesses. The message isn't subtle (organized religion bad; Catholics really bad!) and gets old after 500 pages of hammering. There are much better informed iconoclasts around (James Morrow) who have done the topic justice and aren't boorish. Those are the writers who will be read in a hundred years while Last Day is forgotten on the big remainder table in the sky."
3,"A great performance, but not a great recording","I bought this hoping to get not only one of the most celebrated performances of the fugues, but one of the finest recordings as well. It is a great performance, but the recording falls flat. The pipe organ is such an awesome instrument to hear live, but capturing it is difficult. The main problem here is that the rumbling resonances of the lower registers are simply lost and the highs seems too distant to bring home their shrill, piping intensity. I'm still looking for the definitive recording."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!,"I don't know what people are complaining about as our vsmile has worked perfectly without a single problem. We own the Vsmile game system and recently in the fall also got the pocket system so we can take it on the go. We have all the systems for our kids...the Vsmile, the Leapster and the Pixter and by far my kids LOVE the Vsmile the most! They will play it all day if I let them and they learn so much! I highly recommend this product as you will not be disappointed. By the way, my children are 5 and 3 and work the product just fine."
4,VTech Smile Portable,"This product arrived promptly, and in working order. My grandson who is almost four, was able to work it without much difficulty. My granddaughter six has the other model that is strictly for the home, and she has been using it for three years. Both products are sturdy, good for entertainment, and a learning tool, with a lot of diversity in the games.The Portable was more expensive, which is a shame, but it was worth the price.Sherry Rumby"
1,Buy the Leapster instead,"We bought this for our 4yr old for Christmas. We had problemswith the regular VSmile in the past but figured we would take achance on the pocket size and were excited it worked with thetv also. It worked for a few days then shut off in the middleof a game and wouldn't turn back on. We tried new batteries,restart etc. I saw the other reviews online about the ""bad batch"" and confirmed my suspicions. We returned the game to ToysRUs and got the Leapster. WE LOVE IT! With the credit we bought the Leapster AND Dora game which is EXCELLENT!!!Save yourself some problems- buy the Leapster instead!!!"
3,Figured out how to make it operate better!,"As many others have stated in their reviews, we had also had difficulty with the thing spontaneously shutting off. We are on the second V Smile. I however found a way to keep it working. When the cartridge is able to move slightly in the slot, the connection is easily lost. I found that stuffing a folded piece of paper behind the catridge helps to maintain proper placement in the slot without movement. Although this sounds like a lot of effort, it is worth it because we have acquired many cartridges as well as accessories making this an expensive investment. I hope this tip helps others whose children enjoy the actual game but are having problems with operating quality."
2,Not great...,I got this for my 3 1/2 year old son and the darn thing kept shutting off on him. We tried replacing the batteries and it worked for a short while but started doing it again very quickly. This makes a 3 year old very mad!! We ended up returning it and got the Leapster. He's almmost 5 now and the Leapster still works great!
3,"Great system, but have trouble with shutting down.","My 5 year old received this for christmas this year, and she absolutely loves it! So do my 3 and 6 year olds. The games are very educational, and even my 3 year has learned a lot from it!My only issues with the system, is it keeps shutting down on us and freezing. I have contacted the company, and their advice is to hit the reset button (which does get it running again) or change the batteries. I don't want it to freeze in the first place! We had bought an adapter for it, but the adapter port has already broken. It will only work if you hold the plug to the side, and you can't do that and play it at the same time. It does eat the batteries fast, too. The company would take it back to repair, but the gift giver no longer has the receipt, so we're just kinda stuck dealing with the freezing screens. Maybe it was just mine, I'm not sure, but I expected more for about $80."
2,"Fun and education, but made poorly","We got this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He had been asking for it and he really likes it and is fairly good at the Dora game. However, after 2 months, the LCD is messed up (has a bunch of lines through it but the game looks fine when hooked up to the tv). Also, the system freezes up every once in a while even with brand new batteries. My son only played it maybe 2-3 hours per week for 2 months before it started doing all this. I would not purchase this item again, and I'm going to contact the manufacturer and see if they can repair it."
1,don't waste your money,"My son received this for Christmas and it worked that night. Only. Reset didn't work. I changed the batteries twice. The AC/DC adapter doesn't help. Returned it. Against my better judgement, I purchased another one for him last week ... just in case we had been unlucky the first time. This one worked for all of one day. The company should be ashamed of themselves for putting this expensive toy on the market. We have a V-Smile box that plugs into the TV that just broke. But at least it lasted two years. This pocket contraption is a complete waste of money."
1,V-Tech needs to go back to the drawing board...,"V.Smile Pocket: First unit froze up in 10 seconds with the included game and it would not recover (even after using the reset and pulling out the batteries the unit was defective). So we exchanged it, but not much more luck: The 2nd unit freezes periodically with both the included game and with another game (Dora's fix it adventure). We've returned the 2nd unit.Overall very disappointing. We think V-tech will need a year or two to debug the code and get this thing right.Would advise using $80 elsewhere."
1,Not a readable or coherent instructional tool.,"I am not at all a computer novice, but I found the book hard to follow, giving little instruction. It is also extremely outdated- the program code is in BASIC and COBOL, and it makes reference to punch cards. Yikes!"
3,Strip review,I have to agree with previous reviews regarding issues of little hands still being able to reach inside the protector. I guess something is better than nothing.
3,"Single 40"" Dragon Datio Bokken Kendo Pratice Sword","This product is a very nice looking sword, that is if you just wants to look at it, it's not very strong and breaks easily. If you plan to do some serious practice with it then it won't last you more than a month, mine only last for 3 weeks and then broke."
3,Nice look,"Looks good, but the blade guard is secured by an O ring and that doesn't work too well. Good enough for a Halloween prop."
5,Nancy does it again,This is one of her better ones and they are all good. A real jazz person's jazz not just pop or standard singer. Her phrasing is wonderful and you can understand all of it. Love it~~
2,Food = Lukewarm - Chinese-Made,It's true - this Stanley food jar does not live up to the name Stanley. Don't waste your hard-earned money for this Chinese-made plastic impostor of the original Stanley quality. I have this food jar and don't even bother to use it anymore because the food gets lukewarm in a couple of hours. You can spend less or about the same on eBay and get a vintage metal U.S. made Stanley Wide Mouth Food Jar that will keep your food hot for the whole day. I did that and am so much happier. I now buy vintage American-made Thermoses and food jars. All of them keep my food and beverages hot all day and the vintage thermoses even hot over night and into the next morning!
3,V,"I enjoyed the reboot of the V series. Interesting stories and characters accompany quality special effects. The stories towards the end of 2nd season leave too many doors open. Unfortunately, this series ended too soon."
3,Too Expensive,"This Season two set wasn't even close to being worth $30.00. There's only two discs and an abrupt ending.It does offer some closure from the season one story.The first disc is episode after episode of ""who cares"" I believe that when they saw just how dismal the first half dozen turned out, that they decided to focus and get back to better scripts. Unfortunately it was too late and even though the last disc of episodes was better, you could totally tell that they weren't coming back for a third season. They still left us with a cliff hanger.Wait until the cost is $10.00.Falatin"
5,BIG UP BEENIE,"All I can say is go thru Beenie. I have been sick and tired of the watered down pop-dancehall that Jamaican artists have been coming out with for the sake of appealing to fickle American audiences. Glad to see Beenie go back to his roots, singing music for his people, who won't turn on him for expressing his culture.As to the lyrical content, perhaps from now on Beenie should make 2 versions of his CDs- the true dancehall for those who understand the culture and don't read more into it than they should, and a watered down version for the US market, for the wanna-be hip who suddenly discovered dancehall and feel like they can criticize that which they do not understand.Either way, if you are not a hardcore dancehall lover from foundation, don't bother buying this CD. It is what it is, take it or leave it. But Beenie, Nuff RASpect for keeping it real again, SEEN"
2,"too hard to open, not suitable for all outlets","I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up. It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open. Yes, it's childproof, but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all. It also doesn't fit all outlets. I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they don't have the sides that have to go into the wall, instead they protrude out."
3,not what i expected,the covers are too thin/narrow and the holes at the bottom for the cord is to small for some plugs.
3,For Kids,I think these will work much better on kids socks. Mine are heavy winter in Vermont socks. Big saftey pins it is.
1,Frustrated,"This charger never worked, not only was it difficult to put onto the charger once you thought you had it on, it really wasn't on. There is a light that indicates when it is on properly, but once you got it on it would always pop off and then you would have to wrestle with it to get it back on. THen it never held a charge on a brand new system. It would turn off right in the middle of a game or not at all. Very frustrating for a 5 year old. I just threw mine out because all it was doing was taking up space. Save your money and get a car plug in or just use the outlet plug.NEVER WORKED."
3,tricky products but the kids love it,"Well after having a console vsmile that is ""tricky"" I figured the pocket would be the same. The charger is a little bit fustrating. I put the pocket in the dock and the light flashed rapidly and then went off. After a couple of times of this I read some other reviews and tried the suggestion of pushing down on it. I did that for maybe thirty seconds and then it started to flash no problem since. Hopefully it will hold up!"
2,Product arrived broken,One plastic perch was found broken off this the feeder upon arrival. I suppose this was due to poor packaging rather than a manufacturing defect.
2,"Not bad, while it lasted","It worked well, and the birds enjoyed the feeder... for about two days. Then, the squirrels had managed to chew off all of the plastic. Search for another feeder if you have squirrels."
4,Value for money,Have had it for a few weeks now. Easy to use right out of the box. Decent connection. Haven't even tried out all the features available. Want to see how long the batteries last. All in all a good buy.
4,Amazing product but speaker volume should have been higher,Very good product but volume is little less than what is required and in noisy place it can barely be heard.
2,Where is Bardot?,Bardot barely appears in this movie and when she does it isn't for long and looks more like a child than a young woman. Bardot fans should skip this one. Others may find this swashbuckling tale interesting but I didn't.
4,El mundo de las redes está aquí,"El mejor texto para quienes no quieren hacer el Programa CCNA...y está en español. Desventajas: su precio, el grueso y que la traduccción tenga algunas fallas. Pero vale la pena tenerlo."
3,A good book to get a networking overview,"I didn't know anything about networking before reading this book and after finishing I've learnt the key concepts in this area.Nevertheless, this is not a book to pass the CCNA test. I think it is a good book for those who are interested in this area and do not want to begin directly with a CCNA test book.As a bad point, I should say the translation does not seem to be very accurate (as my English!), and sometimes is difficult to understand some explanations."
5,It works!,When this product fails due to a broken metal stop bar just pick another and pop it in. Installation is easy and your garage door opener is running again! DON'T BUY A WHOLE NEW GARAGE DOOR OPENER!!! This will do the trick.
4,American DJ Tripod ....worked once I bought a part,"I am not sure if I got sent the wrong extension tube but it was 1 1/2"" and it needed a 1 1/4"" tube. So I had to go to Home Depot to buy a new extension tube and then it worked great. It does seem kind of cheaply made..but I suppose it doesn't need to withstand too much. I like it now that I have the new tube."
5,cool,it cool but not good as zatch bragos spells are strong but zatch bell can do both because of rasheild
4,a Classic album,"Kate Bush is one of the few ""pop"" artistes that I like, she isnt pop now, but she used to be. Anyway this cd has a very special sound, and it isnt for those that like ""Radio friendley material"" that are ""in"". The song ""Love and Anger"" ""Deeper Understanding"" are great songs, but the song that makes this album one great Album is ""This womans work"". It is one of the best and most beautifull songs ever. I remember when I was a child I was watching Mtv, and this song came on, and I was crazy after the song(this was in 1989). It is a piano ballad, that bring the genre to a new hight. The lyrics is well written on the album, and not the typicially shallow songs, that most pop artist write. The lyrics are deep, and great. Not al of the songs are that great, but after al Kate Bush is awesome, and I wish that the musicians today in that genre(pop) could be as great, Unfortunitially they arent. But since we are talking about Kate Bush, she sure deserves 4 star -:)"
3,"A good sampling of ""This Woman's work"".","I find this to be a good album from Kate Bush. It has a nice vibe, and is very consistent in mood, but what keeps it from being great like her previous album, is that nothing really stands out. Still very good though. ""Sensual World"" and ""Love And Anger"" are two of the better songs up front. One of her best tracks ever is included, ""This Woman's Work"", however I heard Maxwell cover it a few years back, and his version is actually just as wonderful. Overall this is a good disc to pick up used, or a good buy for the fanatic. What she really needs though is an updated and remastered collection, since her ""Whole Story"" best of is from 1986."
5,Astonishing music that rock your dreams,"'The Sensual World' is a legendary album. From the captivating luscious title track to the rambunctious 'Head We're Dancing', Kate combines other wordly elements into the emotion of the music. Every time I hear the song 'Deeper Understanding' I almost have a relapse. I faint from the amazement. As you can tell I am an HSP (Highly Sensitive Person) and this music is like no other. It is a must for a highly rich person with deep emotions and inner drive."
5,My two girls look great!,I received two of these for Christmas 2006 for my two miniature schnauzers (one is 10 pounds and the other is 13 pounds). This small one was for my 10 pound girl and it fit great!The material is super soft and it is well made and easy to put on them. I now can keep them well groomed and shaved even during the cold months and not feel bad they that they are freezing.
2,Very Dissapointed,"I have loved this book for years. My niece had several Fujikawa books that were recently handed down to my daughter. The hand-me-down copy of Babies (printed in 1980) was getting torn up so I ordered a new one to replace it. The new copy is missing 6 pages. My daughter is 19 months old and flips back and forth saying ""grow, grow"" looking for pages that are not there. Everything else is the same. This is still a beautiful book but I'm very dissapointed that this new version is missing pages...and so is my daughter.Should have read the reviews before buying this reprint (printed in 2006)."
5,Best Cuddle Book,"I've read this to my daughter since she was 4 mos. At 16 mos. she just loves this book. I use the pictures of babies doing things like being nice to a younger child, doing things for themselves, and being good or naughty to talk to her about day-to-day events. When I read the line, ""All babies liked to be hugged and cuddled and loved,"" my daughter snuggles close to me and says, ""Oh Baby."" This book is priceless. The illustrations are not only beautiful but feature children of diverse backgrounds."
3,Not as good as original,"This book was my children's favorite book when they were toddlers. My original copy was read over and over and is now held together by book tape. So I purchased four of these books to give as shower presents. While the illustrations that are present are exactly as the original book, the books I recently purchased lack four pages that are present in my original book. Since there are only a few pages in the book, the missing four pages make quite a difference. I am disappointed with my purchase."
5,Favorite Baby Book,This book was our son's FAVORITE baby book 24 years ago. We still make sure we give a copy to everyone we know when they have a baby. The illustrations and text seem perfect for babies and toddlers.
5,a classic,This was my favorite baby as a baby according to my own mother and it is also now my 8 mth old son's favorite book as well. I give it a high recommendation.
4,Not just my gut feeling!,"A compelling informative guide to the concept of ""Big brain and little brain"". This book is super And its not just my gut feeling. Readers may also look up ""Natural Stomach Care"", and ""Your Gut Feelings""."
3,It's a little small,"I'm sure that the product description contained the charm's size, but it arrived, it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Guess I should have expected that, based on the price!"
4,Some improved features,"I love how easy the one click red-eye fix works. The one step photo fix is nicer with the added feature ""smart photo fix"". The other brush features are easy to use. It does a nice job removing digital camera noise.One thing I'm not really pleased with is the browser. I liked how it worked in ver. 9. I find it easier to drag and drop my photos instead of using the browser. But I felt that way when I moved from Win 98 to XP.Overall, I am satisfied with this version. Anytime there is change, you will make some good and bad choices; but I feel this is a good choice for me."
3,Go find a copy of version 7,"I guess Corel thought PSP would sell better if it was dumbed down for the masses. I am in complete agreement with everyone who says Corel has done a bad number on it.I had been using 7 and decided to try Pro X, it being on sale. In their attemps to make it user friendly they have turned PSP into a toy program, that creates more frustration than it solves"
4,The Persauders/Protectors worth the price.,First I have the complete collection of the Persauders one of the besttv series ever made! Curtis and Moore made a great team. This seriesshould've been on for years. I got this set for The Protectors andThe Prisoner which I haven't seen since I was a kid. The ChampionsI don't recall but would like to see it. I thought this was a greatpackage for the price to see these shows again. If your a fan ofthese kind of tv shows this is a great package to start with.
4,super spy megaset,DVD's were received in a very short time. All of the shows I've been able to watch are great. Good quality. Thanks.
2,Not worth it,I bought this for my kids for christmas who both love their V Smile system. I was suprised that my daughter had not played with it since Christmas day so I decided to try it out myself. I was very disappointed. I know it is only 30.00 but it hardly does anything. It asks you to draw straight lines and when I was drawing them it was telling me that I was wrong. The 2 games that are included are very plain. I would rather pay 20.00 for a vsmile game then continue using this. In my opinion the Disney Dream Sketcher is better and at least they can print out the pictures that they draw on the printer.
2,"Good idea, but it is not very user-friendly","I am so glad that I tested this out before Christmas. My son is very into art and drawing, so I thought he would love this. And I am sure that he would, if it worked properly. The screen is just not sensitive enough at some times, and too sensitive at others. You have to either press very hard on the icons to get them to work, or tap a few times very lightly. There is absolutely no consistency to it. An older child might not mind, but I think it would really frustrate a 3-5 year old. I think that this is one of those toys that was rushed through development to make it to the market in time for Christmas, and that is a shame because this is a great idea. I hope that they will fine-tune it, I would definately buy it again if they would take the time to work out the kinks."
5,A real pleasure,"One of the best readings I have had in years. The combination of superbly documented historical facts and modern fiction is beautifully merged to form a very atractive intrigue. For non English language natives like me, Mr. Merry has laid out a distinctive language that shows his dominium of the word and his extensive culture. A real pleasure, as well, for those like myself that know Panama and can recreate our rememberings. I want to see more coming out of Mr. Merry's keyboard soon."
2,Glorious Burden not so glorious.,"Boring, just plain boring. It looks as though they have lost it. When the Eagle Cries is a poorly developed song. The intention of the song good yes and that I can appreciate, however intention does not mean the song is a good song. I like all of the Iced Earth works preceding this one.Oh I can't even say much more, I'm so disapointed in the band. If this is the sort of stuff they are going to have to offer, I have bought my last Iced Earth Album."
1,glam progressive c r a p,"old singer was WAY better, I like ripper on the Priest albums, these lyrics are stupid, you cant even sound tough singing them: In the video hes all tryign to look angry singing ""Destiny spawned us, it's the reckoningThis time it's our blood, don't tread on me "" how many bands have had dont tread on me? Extreme, metallica? this musics u c k s! glam metal and progressive metal s u c k s!, nevermore would be a better band for this type of music. So you all can keep your glass shattering vocals crap with real dumb lyrics!!R.I.P Iced Earth"
5,Awesome!,This is a great CD! Every song is awesome. Make sure you get the 2 cd version. For a more in depth review go to my site at www.stranglerfig.com
1,crap,"I am a big fan of Iced Earth and power metal in general. I gave this cd a chance with an open mind about Tim Owens taking over the vocals, but trust me, this is dung!!! If you are a fan of melodic power metal forget this piece and look for the new cds by Dionysus or Heavenly instead!"
3,Disappointing,"Many of the same Iced Earth components are present here: the galloping guitar work of Jon Schaffer, the powerful drumming of Richard Christy, the epic subject matter. So far, I am finding myself disappointed in this album, though. Part of the the reason is the singing of Ripper Owens. Change always brings disappointment in the diehard fans, but his range and tone really don't live up to high standard set by Matt Barlow. The real drawback here is the songwriting. I'm not a big fan of Schaffer's patriotic songs (aside from the subject matter, they tend to be trite and boring), but here we get most of an album of them. This album continues the trend of fewer out-and-out thrashers and more ""slow"" pieces, which are not why I listen to Iced Earth."
4,Great release,I've been a fan of this band since the Something Wicked This Way Comes cd (being the first I bought). I feel this is another brilliant release. I just love schaffers choppy and harsh sounding guitar riffs and although some of the riffs on this cd sound recycled thats just Schaffers style. When these riffs are combined with a good vocalist (now tim owens) it just brings an epicness to a lot of the songs seldom other heavy metal bands are able to match. Not their best but still bloody good!!
2,Dissapointed...:(,"I expected so much more from IE than this album. Musically, it has got to be one of their worst. Tim is not to blame...he does a great job trying to elevate the boring and lackluster songwriting that plagues this recording. There are a few decent tracks but nothing impressive. This is not the ""masterpiece"" that Jon promised. As for the trilogy...boring. Jon dropped the ball on this one. Listen before you buy :("
5,possible nov 18th release,not entirely sure as the IE website has not been updated in forever and a day but multiple stores have this set as nov 18th date and the Limited Edition for jan 13thmy hope is nov 18th but i allready have the single on the way
5,A Tasteful Tale,"Mr Greedy tells the sad tale of a man who can't stop eating. Try as he might, he wants to eat everything in sight. Will Mr Greedy be able to cut back on his eating? Or will his greediness be the end of Mr Greedy? Read it and see!"
4,A veiw from OZ,"Having seen Melissa Etheridge in concert several times Down Under I could not wait to watch this DVD.I found it to be very raw and full of emotion in absolute Melissa Etheridge style. If you are a true fan of Melissa's you will love this DVD.Disc 1 The Concert, a celebration of Melissa's music and of the journey that has helped inspire and create this music, is down to basics just Melissa and her guitars. The sound is raw and emotion is high.Disc 2, gives a small insight into Melissa's behind the scenes life. Not many stars would take a camera into their home. There is also a fairly informal interview where Melissa talks about her thoughts and experiences on Sept 11, plus footage of the tour.To Melissa THANKYOU for a courageous and BRILLIANT DVD."
4,An Empire worth fighting for,"The eternal battle of the sexes rages on and this time it is fought among the stars.Charlotte Boyett-Campo mingles the threads of ancient Roman history with Celtic myths of vampires and highland music to forge a world, an Empire, and a love among the stars. Although Kamerone Cree, Rysalian Prime Reaper, and Dr. Bridget Dunne form the central focus of Bloodwind, they are the sword tip upon which a galaxy and an empire turns. Bridget, hungry for the comforts and familiarity of home, falls irrevocably for the animal she feared and hated in Cree, even to offering her life's blood to save him from death, until she is the Empire he willing sacrifices his principles and his way of life to preserve. Add a rebellion of women stolen from nearby systems and Earth divided against themselves and the stranglehold of a despotic empire which has grown fat on hate and fear and you have a tale of dark myth with an even darker end."
1,Disappointed,"If you're looking for For pure Barbra vocals - search elsewhere. If you are looking for a Barbra history lesson - this may be just what you are looking for. Fully 40% of the cuts are her awards, intros by emcees etc. 90% of the remaining cuts are spoiled by one annoyance or another. Very disappointing."
5,Simply Diva!,"This box set has many surprises and good songs. A definitely must have for Barbra fans and a great introduction to new Barbra fans out there. Barb has been around for a few decades and she has kept her voice nicely without staying in the same stage. From the first song to the last of this compilation, one will understand why she is still around. She is a special entertainer with many talents. With the people who she collaberates with, one should understand she is not that difficult to work with. There are songs that may not be the best of hers but the booklet tells you why she didnt chose them for her album in the first place. She has made a good choice on songs, not too new but stuff that we have not heard of. It is not that those songs she put in this boxset is crap, it is just because they were not ""right"" for the albums. The historical and pictures are wonderful to look at. Barbra is simply a diva!"
2,Not made to with stand a 3 year old,My son got this for his birthday. It was such a piece of junk that we ended up taking it back to the store for a return. The side peices would not stay on and even I could not get the cars to go long enough to finish the race. The sounds were annoying and the toy was just not what i expected it to be at all.
2,"Fun, but not","Purchased for a 4-year-old's birthday. The most we could get the cars to round the track was 5 times. Reviews were read that purchased cars were better than the cars that came with the track, but this is not true. No matter how new the batteries are and how many times we shake the cars, they go around five times. Disappointing. The fencing/barriers come off so easily that we don't bother using them, and the track also comes apart easily. The 2 stars is for the fact that my boys enjoy playing with the cars on the floor. Overall, not as fun at home as it seemed to be in the store."
3,Fun,"My 3 year old son loves this. The only problem is..we can't seem to get the track to just stay together. It always seems to come apart while he is playing with it. I may just have to get some glue out for it! Aside from that, it's lots of fun!"
3,humidifier could be better,"the holms HM630-U humidifier works good to keep the humidity at a comfortable level .. it reduces static charges that are a problem in cold weather .. while it works good it has one problem .. when the humidity reaches the value you set on its display then the machine cycles on and off constantly .. this keeps the humidity dead on but is distracting .. it should have some hysteresis so that it waits until the level has dropped a few percent before it turns back on .. as it is, it runs a few seconds on then a few seconds off .. it keeps repeating this forever .. its easy to refill if you have a hose or deep sink but the tank doesnt stand up on its end while filling .. so you have to hold it .. all in all its one of the better humidifiers i have used and it doesnt use a lot of power like some .."
5,Bought two of them!!,"Got one for our house and one for our cabin, very impressed!! Not to loud at all, has 3 speed settings as well as full auto settings adds humidity VERY FAST, hours not days."
2,Not impressed,"I definitely agree on all points made by reviewer Mr. Average. I found this humidifier to be quite noisy, but bearable only on the lowest setting. The humidity level does increases rapidly. However, I stopped using the programmable features for the very same reason -- loud fan on, loud fan off. It drove me crazy.Also, the bottom end of the filter sits in the resevoir and remains wet because it is constantly in contact with the water originating from the tank. Despite my efforts to empty the tank/resevoir and air out the filter every morning, it never completely dries out. Now when I turn the humidifier on, it gives off a moldy odor. I have just purchased this product and have only used it about 10 times, so it seems rather soon to have to change the filter. I plan on returning it."
5,very effective and quiet,purchased for large family room and very effective at reducing annoying static shock; easy to refill and clean; very quiet
1,Cerftifiable Piece of Junk!,"This humidifier lasted exactly 4 days before it just stopped working. It took a ridiculous 25 minutes to set it up and getting to pump out some mist the first night, but otherwise seemed to be working well. It was annoying that it needed to be cleaned every day instead of once a week like the directions said, but I can deal with that. By the second night, the knobs started acting a little temperamental. By the third night, the power light stopped working even though the unit was operating (safety hazard), water was leaking out of the knobs (safety hazard) and the humidifier wouldn't create steam unless it was set on full blast (wall/carpet/floor damage). Next time I tried to turn it on, nothing happened, it was dead. What a waste of time! Do yourself a favor and buy a better brand."
2,lots of knocking sounds,"I don't know if it's just my unit, but mine makes a lot of ""knocking"" sounds from, what I assume, are all the bubbles forming from the boiling of the water. I do hear a light gurgling sound, which isn't so bad, but even the low setting causes a bigger knocking sound every 10 seconds or so. The high setting is just unbearable for me during the night as I am a very light sleeper. I do get a continual mist, which is great, but the noise from this unit is a big disappointment."
2,poor design,"The good news is that the device does humidify the air pretty well. And mine is not noisy, apparently unlike some other units reviewed here. The bad news is that the quality and design are both poor, making the device difficult to clean, difficult to refill, and difficult to trust. I do not recommend this humidifier."
1,poorly constructed,this humidifier is cheap all around. The container that holds the water is made of flimsy plastic and does not fit in the base easily. It is also VERY noisy - do NOT waste your time/money on this.
1,A lot problem,"I think there are some design problem with this humidifier. For 5 times I refilled the tanks, only 2 times works. I return it, this should go to the junk yard."
4,Time-saver,"I always do sunny-on-the-side for my breakfast. I don't have to put any oil or butter on pre-heat and the ""sunny"" shapes perfect every time. After cooking, it takes only 1 minute to wash up and wipe with a paper towel. It saves me at least 10 minutes on every use and gives me the luxury to enjoy the time with the meal."
2,Regret asking for this,I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one!
4,Replacement B&S OEM Part,"This part was purchased to replace the original starter cord on a 15 year old B&S; engine. The part fit fine, but the rope is noticably thinner and the handle noticably smaller than the original. But, the handle was wide enough to comfortably start the engine.I don't think the new rope will last as long as the own rope, but we will see."
5,The Purpose and Power of Prayer,"This is a very powerful book. If you have any questions about prayer or how to have your prayers answered, this is a good book to get.The thing I like most about Myles Monroe is that every thing he teaches is rooted in the Word of God. So far, all of the books I've read from Myles Monroe have been nothing less than highly motivational, educational, easy to understand and the best part is that he forces you to act on what your reading. I really belive God is working through this man.If your reading this review, GET THE BOOK! Trust me.It will be a blessing to you."
1,FALSE DOCTRINE PAR EXCELLENCE,"This book is full of false teaching and claims that either are not or cannot be substantiated by the clear, consistent teaching of scripture. Also, this book is just a recycling of what has been taught in 'Word of Faith' circles for years."
2,If only I could've stayed awake to finish it...,"This is the first of Miles Monroe's books I've read (and most likely the last). He is an awesome speaker and teacher, but I found his written work to be unnecessarily wordy as a result of it being overly repetitive (and not necessarily in a clarifying way)--a format that works when teaching, but not when writing as the reader can easily go back and re-read a missed point. So needless to say, I never made it through the book--though I did give it a few good shots!"
4,One of the best books about Victorian England,"Whether you use this book purely for research purposes or simply because you are curious about English life during Victoria's Reign, you will not be disappointed. The content is exceptionally impressive, with none of the padding out and boring text often found in history books. The book is divided into different sections which deal with a wide range of subjects, so you don't have to read through lots of text just to find one particular subject. The book is well illustrated and all kinds of topics are included, from clothing to Victorian morality. As a historical author, I personally found this book to be extremely beneficial and enjoyable to read."
1,CS Checklists Review,"Would be more helpful if organized by Chief Complaint. Also- lists for workup are not accurate according to rules and regulations of the CS exam. Counseling, referrals, trials of meds, etc are part of the encounter itself. Only forbidden parts of the exam, lab tests, diagnostic tests are allowed in the workup. It is time for a new, updated edition."
2,"Great design, bad ergonomics","Much larger than you'd guess, looks as great in person as photo. However, I returned this one along with several Manhattan Toy brand puppets because it's hard to get any hand in them, and even harder to convincingly manipulate the mouth. Had high hopes, but opted for more realistic-looking Folkmanis brand, whose aesthetic is more realistic than fun, and WAY more functional/ergonomic."
3,underminded,they sound a lot like thrice. a lot. well old thrice. thrice's new cd is beyond horrible. well musically they sound very very similiar to thrice and the guy's scream sounds very similiar to the guy from thrice's scream...which they never did a lot a lot of. but these guys aren't bad. i saw them live and they were pretty good...the frontman is a douche thoughps. listen to paper tigers by thrice and then listen to the first song on here.
3,Functional and conversation piece,Functional and conversation piece.Have trusted SOG for years so when I saw this design it was a must have back up hiking tool.Lighter than you would think by the shape and size.Came with a button strap sheath.
4,Nice knife,"Nice knife. My only issues with it is that the handle feels too thin. I'm going to fix this by wrapping it with ""tennis"" tape. The knife feels solid and exactly as I expected."
5,Light Knife,Knife was very light and great for backpacking. Good for some light bushwacking and all around camp use.
1,Blade cracked first time using it,"Terrible Knife,light duty trail/brush trimming bent and cracked the blade first time out.It wasn't abused.The reviews of the longer version are much the same,broke,chipped or cracked very easily.This knife shouldn't be called jungle anything, as its only good for steaks."
4,Annie is hard to find,"I went through a lot of changes to finally get this, no one has it and we saw the first half of this episode and never saw the end. Finally thanks to amazon we got is right before Christmas, great ending, nice to see the value and priorities discussed. I also has a few other little episodes included."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of William Bennett's Book of Virtues series, and I was hoping that these videos would provide a nice compliment to the printed books. Although the stories were sweet, they were also sort of sappy. Plus the different stories told within one episode seemed (to my kids) to be rambling and unconnected (although an adult would know that they shared a moral point). Worst of all, the dialogue was stilted and the voices of the children were just awful -- sounded like grownups pretending to be kids. The voices were so bad that my kids were laughing at the characters and complaining that they were ""annoying."" Just not as entertaining and engaging as I had hoped. Sort of defeated the purpose of instilling some good moral values in an entertaining and engaging format."
3,an amazing christmas,this is an amazing cd.part of the proceeds goes to special olympics inc. i know this because i have the other 4cds. i am a special olympian this cd is definately a must have for everybody.
2,OH WELL,"I ordered this CD for a friend before I bought it. How sorry I did so. I may have to cancel the order and get something else. Stevie sings exactly the same song as last time? Why?? And most of the songs, although by different artists, are virtually identical to prior years' offerings. How sad that this is for charity. Perhaps the Special Olympics needs new people to choose the songs. Thank God the artists sing well."
1,No music,This was awful except for one song Blue Christmas by Bon Jovi the music was terible i never heard anything like this i won't take it for nothing Jim
2,Not a good movie,"Mix the bad movies you have seen about the Rapture, with a Mayan calendar, and some Baptist silliness and you get this movie. The only thing scary in the movie is all the scenes where one person is driving and talking to the passenger while looking at them and not the road for minutes at a time."
3,"Not as good as her first book, Mama Makes Up Her Mind.","I read this book because I truly enjoyed her previous work, Mama Makes Up Her Mind. But I was disappointed by this one. Several short stories seemed to have not much substance and not very funny altogether. I enjoyed less than half of all stories, ie. Red the Rat Man, Career Choices, Computer School, Horror Movies."
1,Disappointment,I have previously been a big fan of Jane Heller's books. This was a big let down. Contrived and just not funny. Hopefully the author will soon return to her winning form.
2,"Looks nice, uncomfortable","I bought this for my wife. She likes the way it looks, but it is too tight under the arms. It is too uncomfortable to wear. I am trying to stretch the arm holes so she'll wear it."
4,Cool Game!,"This game is really neat! You get to trade for Game Boy exclusive cards. You learn Pokémon Trading Card Game skills, plus it has an in-game tutor to help you learn how to play if you don't already know how. It also has very good deck suggestions..."
2,not the greatest game in the world,"There are 3 games to play, but for one of them you need 2 gameboys and 2 cartridges. For another one, you just walk around through buildings and do absolutely nothing. In the other one, you just make a deck but it has to have 60 cards in it and only one deck has 60 cards in it. This game is really confusing, especially if you don't have the instructions. Don't buy it!"
5,A great tripod for 1-4 lights,"This is a great tripod stand & well worth the price. Has a very sturdy aluminum frame which I was hoping for. I only planned to use 2 led's & it fit the bill perfectly! What I love most is the fact it can go 12 feet making your light show have it's best impact as the lights are higher. One thing about the side bars is that cover up a couple of the 4 mount brackets going across the T-bar but I simply took the side bars off,Voilà! This tripod will be used for years to come. Highly recommended for the mobile DJ light show!"
1,Nestle Bottled Water - Dont Buy,"The Nestle brand of bottled water did not taste well at all. If you have tasted Poland Springs or Dasani etc. you will NOT like this brand at all. I will never buy this brand ever and suggest that others dont too, unless you wish to waste your hard earned money."
3,Lots of unrealated Content,"There are only about 20 pages in this book that have to do with Speed Reading. Most of the book is success stories and how to improve your study habits which would be fine if the book was titled ""Improve Your Study Habits and Get a Brief Introduction to Speed Reading"" but it's not."
1,Nice paperweight,"I read this book because it claimed to help increase reading by 50%. I thought that I was a strong reader. I read about 230 words per minute. Well, after reading this book, I read about 250 words per minute. 20 words wasn't worth it!"
2,"Big on claims, short on detail","I wouldn't exaclty label this book as worthless; indeed, there are many useful tidbits and techniques which can help many students become more successful in the classroom. My complaint concerns the nuts and bolts of how to attain the ""3,000"" word per minute reading level which is regularly advertised throughout the book. In fact, I found the book largely containing anecdotes and stories of how other readers utilized the program to acheive superhuman reading levels. I was left thiking ""is there a book 2 that I'm missing""? If you can learn to read via skimming your fingers underneath the sentences you've pretty much already got 90% of this book down. Perhaps the author should have focused only on speed reading rather than incorporating other information regarding studying skills, note taking, etc; all worth while, but not pertinent to those who got the book for the primary purpose of reading faster. In short, there are more useful books out there on the subject."
3,"Basic, Bulletproof Phone with One Major Design Flaw","When I lightning storm took out my old landlines a couple of years ago I decided I'd not bother spending real money on new phones. I bought two of these. Who uses landlines anymore anyway?These phones are so basic. You have to put in four AA batteries for the caller ID/memory to work, but it seems to last forever thereafter. And there's a little plastic clip that holds the handset to the base if you've got this thing wall-mounted. Lose that and you're screwed. Othe than that the phone sounds just fine and you can clear all your calls with a press-and-hold then press again of the delete button. That's all I use it for; to check my missed calls (no answering machine) and pick it up every once in awhile when I'm home (80% of calls are telemarketers/blocked calls and I don't bother). Everyone important to me generally calls me on the cell anyway."
2,The Bangles Get Boring,"From their very first single (back when they were just ""The Bangs""), I bought the Bangles' records as soon as they were released. I was never disappointed until this, their last album. The group gets all dolled up for the cover with glamorous looks, then attempts to sound more ""mature"" and ""adult,"" and as a result they put out this lackluster album. It is overproduced, saccharine, and just boring. The only song that I think is really worthy is the Michael Steele song ""Complicated Girl,"" a simple melody with great '60s harmonies and sparse production compared to the other excesses like ""Eternal Flame."" Go with one of the earlier albums instead."
5,Includes the First Bangles song I fell in looooove with!,"I am proud to say ""Eternal Flame"" is now a classic, the reason why is It's also found on Sony's Soundtrack for a Century-a 26 disc set. I looove Susanna's vocal as well as the background harmonies. It's very lullabylike,unlike Atomic Kitten's Destiny's Child style Version. Here are some of my other favorites off this CD. ""Crash and Burn""-rocks hard,""In Your Room""-Good except it has something to do with having sex,""Complicated Girl""-cool beat, Debbi's voice is more clearer on ""Be With You"" and ""Some Dreams Come True"", 2 more Vicki songs ""Watching the Sky"", ""Make a Play For Her Now"", and ""I'll Set You Free"", and ""Waiting For You"". Now that they have a new album on the way DON'T CALL THIS THEIR LAST!!!"
3,And 3 stars might be a gift.,"The only reason that this one rates 3 stars are Michael's songs. Otherwise I think I would give it a 2. The Bangles 3 studio releases run opposite 'Til Tuesdays in performance. The Bangles hit a home run the first time out with All Over the Place, came close with their second release, stumbled on the last one. 'Til Tuesday kept getting better and their 3rd release, ""Everything's Different Now"" is my favorite album from the 1980's. Both the Bangles and 'Til Tuesday also had a song called Crash and Burn on their last albums, although they are different songs."
4,"Important contribution, but incomplete and dated.",One of the only Orthodox study bibles available. Howecer a complete version with Septuagint Old Testament is due on the market in 2004. Wait fot this complete edition!
2,Very Little Practical Information,"If you are looking for a book that provides practical leadership tips for motivating your employess, don't waste your money on this one. This book has a very spiritual, new-age feel and is geared more toward someone who wants to become self-motivated as opposed to someone looking to develop motivation skills for business leaders.I am in the process of implementing a leadership development program for our organization, and found no practical help here."
1,A dreadful book,"I anxiously awaited a book on OS X wanting to learn the ins and outs of the new OS and its UNIX underpinnings. Bit inside, I found long, detailed discussions of basic, operating system functionality like saving documents and such. Wading through this oh so basic stuff goes on for 600 pages. The best part was a discussion of AppleWorks where I actually learned something. Finally, I reached the UNIX part and all that appears is a short list of commands and descriptions. There are no examples. There is nothing to help you use UNIX. Out of 700 pages, I found, perhaps, 50 that were somewhat useful. And for what I wanted, I found nothing. Literally, I have never been so disappointed in a book."
1,This is Science?,"My son, who loves dinosaurs, was given this book as a gift from a relative who is into the Young Earth movement. As a Christian, I am disturbed at the latitude the author takes with the Bible. This book would be laughable if it were not so infuriating. Pure indoctrination into the Young Earth cult, that is all that this book is."
1,Truth or faith?,"This book is NOT a science book. This is a Christian explanation to help fill in the gap, since dinosaurs weren't mentioned in the bible. If you truly want to teach your children science... let them examine ALL theories. I think it's ignorant and unfair to shelter your kids from information that is commonly understood to be the most likely theory, by scientist around the world. This is definately a ""homeskooling"" book for people who want to impart the theory of ""inteligunt desine"".... but my kids are actually going to college someday. So I'm going to pass on this one."
5,Excellent children's book to counter anti-biblical theories.,I worry that the one-sided anti-God theories taught in public schools will leave kids confused and doubting biblical truths. This book is perfect to teach them that there are other scientific theories out there that make sense and align with the facts of the bible. Kids need to know that science has NOT proven the bible to be false but that the bible has plenty of scientific evidence to support it. I think I'll buy more copies of this book for friends!
1,0 stars if possible,"This book is completely ludicrous. My husband purchased it from a co -worker thinking it was about the extinction of the dinosaurs and the scientific evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs. Instead it is a fundamental creationist view of what happened to dinosaurs based on biblical ""evidence"". It completely discounts carbon -14 dating and the fossil record based upon the strata of the Earths crust. The woman who sold this to us home schools her children and actually teaches this as fact. I am a Christian myself and have never had an issue with evolution as the means by which God could have created all life. The bible is a metaphor! These people are nuts.Jenny"
2,kind of useless,"the transfer pak only works on a limited number of games and u wont use it a lot unless u have pokemon stadium or perfect dark.if u have those games and hvae game boy versions of them, buy this. If u dont theres not a real reason to buy this if u dont own those games."
3,Incorrect measurement size,Company states the mattress is 76 inches long it is 72 inches long I returned the original mattress but the new one they sent me was 72 inches long. I kept it but they should have corrected their measurements.
5,"Vampires, Werewolves, oh my!","This is the second book in a series by Tanya Huff. And it gets better and better. The trio is back, Vicki, Henry and Mike, who all come together to help solve the case of who's harming and killing the werewolves, who also happen to be Henry's friends. Vicki and Henry get closer in this one. :)A great wonderful book!"
3,Grows on you,"I'm quite liking this book. Unpretentious storytelling is a rare thing, and that's what Huff does quite well. The story takes you along at a nice pace, with just enough of everything to make it satisfying; nice, heroine, description, and plot. Good dialogue. All in all, I'm impressed enough to read more."
4,"Nice listening, if a bit on the sad side","This album includes some very touching numbers:""Something of a Dreamer"" is sweet, sad, yet catchy""This Shirt"" is poignant and sentimental""Mary's Land"" is rhythmic, upbeat, and fun""It won't bring"" is sad but wiseThe songs mostly describe a woman in differing situations regarding love relationships--not very unusual for popular music, let alone country music. It has a number of quite good songs but no real breakout number like ""Passionate Kisses"" etc. on her ""Come On Come On"" album. Still, it's a nice album and tends to capture emotions."
5,Changed my Life,"If it was not for this book I would not be on the internet with my homepage. It is one of the Great books for anyone who wants to be the best at his calling. You will be Great, if you read and act on what you read in this little book of Great wisdom"
2,Not impressed,"Og packages affirmations within a story. Maybe that was of note in 1968 or 1978 or even 2008, but today? The affirmations still have value but the story adds bulk. Each of the 10 messages could be distilled, perhaps into tweets. Maybe Og's style suits you. One listen was enough for me."
2,Did Not Like,"Maybe I'm in the minority here but I did not like this book at all. It is told in story format which is a good thing but it uses old school language like Shakespeare or the Bible which annoyed me. The character's names are ridiculous and hard to remember. What it tells you is basically common sense like don't give up, keep trying, be as friendly possible, etc. It may be good for someone new at selling but if you've been around for any time at all you should already know this stuff."
4,I will resist until I win.,"I will use this day as the last day in my life. I am the most miracle thing in this world. with love, I will be able to conquer lancer of hate, and angriness. I will resist until I win."
1,The Greatest Salesman In The World,"I've reviewed about a dozen products for Amazon.com within the last few months and have rated all products 5 stars. Unfortunately, I read ""The Greatest Salesman In The World"" right after reading ""The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"" and ""Mists of Avalon."" If the last two were five star books, ""Salesman"" is one star in comparison."
1,this book is a joke,"I read it though, and then threw it away. It was a waste of my time. I am an ontrapanuer looking to sell my own product. The advice contained within ""the secrect scrolls"" (ha, ha) was just pure crap. Og discouraged higher education by stating that it is not neccarry to the sales man. He said to look at your potential customer like you love him/her (anybody selling anything appreciates their customers money, but come on I love my wife but to love my customer to make a sale. Why not just sell an excellent product at a fair price and satisfy both yourself and the customer. Good luck reading this and becoming the greatest salesmen. Do yourself a favor and save the five bucks you are going to spend on this book and apply it towards a marketing class at your communtity colloge."
4,Good short read,"Short and sweet. Reading this book makes you think in terms of your basic person, which is nice. It helps you grow up a little.The ten scrolls run you through the basics in an inspiring way. You really believe that you can improve just a little bit, and you can."
3,RAH RAH Speech on steroids,"If listening the RAH RAH motivational speeches helps you, you will love Og Mandino. Basically all of his books are pure emotional rally with very little logical advice. Some salespeople feel they need this to keep them pumped up and positive in the face of daily rejection. If this is you, then this is a 5 star book. If you actually want usable advice don't bother with the writings of Mandino. He gives no usable advice."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I remember reading this years ago when I was selling security systems in Chicago. Been looking for it and finally decided to purchase it again, and reread (short book, but first book to read a 2nd time for me). It didn't impact me as much as the first time reading it as I knew what to expect, but its still pretty neat :)"
4,"Solid mount, easy to install","Overall a great mount. Easy to install, simple instructions, and very heavy duty. My only (and very minor) complaint is that the integrated bubble level was broken on mine when it arrived. But I have my own level, and surely didn't want to wait for a replacement. Mount went up easy, tv is very solid and secure. Feels like you could hang a tank from this thing its so heavy duty."
1,Never got book!,I have not recieved the book and it has been a month. It was suppose to be a Christmas present! Disapointing.
1,Only good feature of EdenPure is advertising,"We bought 2 of these for Christmas. I had high expectations from the advertising in USA Today. This heater performed no better than our $25 regular space heater. Haven't checked the overall utility bills yet, but this seems to me more like clever hype than substantial product. Other reviewers claimed utility bills actually increased 40-50%. We can only return one as one of our family members crushed the box/packaging, which are required for return. We are now stuck with a $300 low quality product. I also understand that owners must clean the filter weekly or the unit shuts off and won't turn back on. Very dissapointed, not only in product, but that a company would sell this snake oil."
1,Gas savings at the cost of high electric bills,"I purchased an EdenPure to save money on our heating of one room where we occurpy most of the time. It had to stay on 24 hours a day to do what the gas heater did in less than two hours a day. Yes we saved a little on the gas but our electric bill which is normally around $150.00 per month went to almost $400.00We no longer use the unit and I know it won't be taken back because of what was said on the reviews. If you value your wallet don't buy one of these products. In my opinion they are a scam and no one should plan on purchasing one to save money. We were trying to heat approximately 400 sq feet and couldn't at all so it had to be left on all day and night just to take the chill off and that drove up the cost.Would never ever purchase one ever again.S SmithEureka, CA 95503"
1,Not Worth The Money Don't Buy,I bought this for my son as an anniversary present and ended up giving him the money instead. Heater is a joke but I am not laughing. I am angry at myself for not reading more reviews before I shelled out money for this product. Going to send it back and try to recoup some of the money. My son is the only one who won out because I had to give him the reciept in case he wanted to return it and he saw the price so he ended up with $400.00 the price of the heater when I bought it back from him. Edenpure Heaters will leave you cold.
5,my experience with an EdenPure heater,"I am so glad to be someone finally saying something positive about the EdenPure heater!!! I have had the 1000XL since 2007 and have never had any of the problems that these people are complaining about.It cuts a tremendous amount off my electric bill because we have total electric heat.My furnace does not run very much at all in cold weather and we do not have to sit around covered up from the cold as some people have said.I have loved this safe little heater from the first time I used it and I just ordered another one yesterday.I am sorry about the bad experiences but I am very, very happy with this heater."
1,does not work as advertised,"I purchased this several years ago as requested by my hubby who is listened to infomercials and believed them. The unit is loud and does not warm up a room as well as a small portable heater for a fraction of the price. When I plug this unit in the same electrical receptacle as my dyson vacuum it blew the fuse, which means it draws a lot of electrical current (though I did not measure). I wanted to return the unit for a refund but I didn't want to deal with the hassle of packing it up and shipping it off. I just chalked it off to a bad purchasing experience. I still get marketing mail from this company after several years, just tear them up and threw in the trash. DO NOT BUY."
1,EdenPure does not honor their warranty,"On a scale of 1-5, I rated it 1 only because 0 was not an option. I purchased an EdenPure heater about one year ago and choose that brand over other cheaper brands because of the 3 year warranty that was so called ""hassle free"". Believe me it has been anything other than hassle free. EdenPure told me that because I purchased on Amazon through a ""third part vendor"", that I purchased through a dealer that is not an authorized dealer. That is the reason they gave for not honoring the warranty. The fan motor quit working after one year and there is not an easy way to get it repaired or replaced.Don't buy the EdenPure brand. There are other brands that are less expensive and work equally well. Very OVER PRICED product. Amazon customer service has been very helpful in getting me connected to the correct person at the manufacturer. I would buy again from Amazon but not from EdenPure"
1,Limited time offer! Get a $30 space heater for $300!,"I don't own the heater, but I had the dubious honor of visiting with an elderly neighbor who fell for the hype. She kept bragging about how wonderful it was, but it just seemed like any inexpensive space heater to me. The room seemed pretty chilly to me, and she was wearing a sweater. I was skeptical, to put it mildly. I was curious to see the electrical connection, to see if it was anything other than a standard plug into a standard wall outlet, but she had it situated so I couldn't see.Later, I saw the infomercial. My suspicions were confirmed: it's just a standard plug-in 1,500 watt electric space heater in a fancy cabinet with digital controls. I never said anything to my neighbor. I asked her how long she'd had it (figuring I'd tell her the scam if it was still under warranty), but it was too late."
3,Undeceided,"We ordered the EdenPure personal size unit back in the fall in order to cut down on the heating cost. It did a really great job with heating the bedroom and kept it at a constant 72, HOWEVER just be aware that under heavy operation that the bulbs burn out in around 3 months and that the unit has to be shipped back in order to replace the bulbs.We also purchased the GEN3 for the Living room, its around 3 month now and it will have to also be shipped back to have those bulbs replaced now as well.Not at all sure I would recommend this for anyone that is considering EdenPure under a constant use."
1,Frigid_out_West,"We purchased the EdenPure 1000XL directly from the manufacture, BioTech Research (Canton, OH). It took twice as long as we were told to arrive and the remote did not work right out of the box. Within five days the unit started turning off and not coming back on despite waiting for hours and room temperture dropping to the point the propane furnace came on.In order to get the unit to restart I had to turn the ""power"" button ""off"" and unplug the unit for anywhere from 5-20 minutes before plugging it back in and turning it on.Only after our experience did I look further into online reviews of EdenPure products which are not favorable. I also checked into BioTech Research (Canton, OH) through the Ohio Better Business Bureau and saw that BioTech has had numerous complaints from customers with similar problems."
1,Home owner,"A watt is a watt is a watt. I worked in the electric utility business a long time. I see the full page ads in our local newspaper promoting a $449 plus S&H; electric space heater. How gullible can people be? Most electric space heaters are rated at 1500 watts at 120 volts. 1500 watts at 120 volts = 12.5 amps which is about 80% of the 15 amp rating of a fuse or circuit breaker (NEC 210-23). A 1500 watt heater produces 5118 BTU/hr. So a big buck space heater puts out the same amount of heat as a $19 heater or 15ea 100 watt incandescent light bulbs.And at $.10/KWH a 1500 watt load (5118 BTU/hr) on for a month (30 days) would cost, $108.00I'm buying a $19.00 space heater."
1,Costs a lot to OPERATE,"We paid the $400 for the Edenpure because we thought it would save us on utility bills over the long run. (The ads say it ""costs pennies to operate."" Well, that's a LOT of pennies, because our gas bill went down and our electric bill went up enough to offset it. It doesn't seem to heat any better than our oil-filled radiator-type heater, either."
3,Just ok...,"Had high hopes for this book, but was somewhat dissappointed. Too shallow and does not ""guide"" the reader in honing skills."
2,Dated,"I really liked the content that was described on the web page for this book, but found it to be less useful once I actually got it and read it. It was probably ground-breaking when it was published, but the material is fairly dated now. I would't recommend it unless you've read nothing else on the topic and wanted to start from scratch..."
5,"People Skills:How to AsertYourself. Listen to Others, and Resolve Conflicks",This is an very detailed people skills guide on how to be sucessful in today's complex world. I found it a very high caliber read about communication.
5,back to broadway,"WHEN YOU READ THE PLAYLIST IT'S ALL BROADWAY STANDARDS THAT HAVE DONE OVER AND OVER, BUT WHEN BARBRA TAKES A SONG SHE MAKES IT HER OWN. IT'S LIKE HEARING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE SHE PUTS A NEW TWIST ON THEM. THIS IS DONE IN THE STYLE OF HER EARLY ALBUMS, HER LATER ALBUMS ARE MORE MELLOW. THIS IS ONE OF HER BEST"
3,OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!,"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! This is THE best Barbra album ever!! The first couple tracks are kinda slow, I must admit, but her duet with Crawford is SMASHING!!!! Beware! If you play this track too loud, it can damage your ears! If you are someone who can't decide which Barbra Streisand CD to get, pick this one! It is the BEST CD that she's ever done!! Oh my goodness, that Music of the Night duet is totally haunting; it's sooo beautiful! It just brings me to tears!"
4,"Giggle, Giggle","We got this for our daughter, and she absolutely loves it! She keeps asking us to play it for her by saying ""Giggle, Giggle"". It was an excellent purchase."
2,"Good first half, boring second half","I have always liked Sade's albums. She has some good songs on 1988's Stronger Than Pride. But what keeps this album from being superior is that boring second half. It may fit for Sade herself, but the second half put me to sleep. Every time I hear it, that section has some boring, stale ballads. She could have made this an EP instead and kept songs like Paradise on it. The Sominex album of 1988--just mostly dull."
4,I Just Play Too Hard! LOL!,"I was really excited to get these sticks, to be honest.I was looking for something that was bigger and lighter than what I was using and these fit the bill, but...I just play too hard. And, yes, I do realize that these are maple sticks.I went through both pairs of these sticks that I purchased during one Sunday morning pre-service practice and service! LOL! They lasted about 2 hours and that was it! But they felt really good in my hands, especially with the Ahead grip tape that I use...They just weren't durable enough for my playing. I was hoping (praying) that the extra size of the stick would be able to compensate for my playing, but, ultimately, it didn't.So I guess I'll go back to my Pro-Mark Hickory 747s for now until I can find something else that'll do the trick for me.If you're not a hard hitter, I recommend these sticks wholeheartedly. Great feel, loved the nylon tips (which is what I prefer), and really liked the size. Enjoy!"
2,UBS Cable,"The cable looks fine but when I print photos they come across a little jumbled on it because of the length... I expected better out of a ""gold"" USB cable... I used to test printers at Lexmark and we had many cables that worked fine for printing at this length."
2,"Ok, but I would not buy it again.","Does not lay flat so would be hard to use with the pendulum. I would have to make copies of the charts to be of use. Also there are many charts that are for specific use, and not that practical for most people. There are only about 5 charts that I would find useful for myself."
4,"An interesting, fun book.","This book is a lot of fun, particuarly for anyone who enjoys role-playing games. The descriptions are vivid, and the actions of the characters are realistic. I can't wait to read the next book, and it wouldn't bother me much if the same thing happened to me."
5,First book in a Fun Fantasy series,"If you enjoy fantasy I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy. The story of gamers taken into the world they created fascinated me. I cared about the characters, especially the baby dragon. Journeying with them as they used their new powers was a great trip. This was a fun read.I recommend it for adults and teens.D. L Burnett, author ofIn the Kingdom of Dragons: Rose and Thorne"
2,Not as impressed as others,"I read the book several years ago and found it silly, fairly unengaging, and filled with poor dialog.One other problem, and this is only partially the author's fault, is that the material is fairly cliché riddled.Granted, the book is fairly old and predates a lot of other DM transports characters into the game, but the idea wasn't really new then either."
5,another great item by logitech,my hard wired mouse was causing a problem and not working correctly. so i did a google search and found out the number one mouse is the logitech 1000 . price tag 80 dollar and a little confusing to operate . so i called my local radio shack and they had this model in stock for 30 dollars . to be honest its worth 3 times that amount . the install took all of 5 minutes and this mouse is more accurate then the one that came with my new dell computer. its comfortable and extremally accurate . well worth every penny . battery life at the minumum is almost a year it takes 2 double A . great mouse.
3,Cordless? Not!,My main purpose for buying a 'wireless' mouse was for it to be 'wireless'; simple enough you would think. But this product is partially wired. It is designed with a transmitting base and that requires a wire. The mouse itself is wireless and it communicates with this wired base. I have a laptop and my work space is very limited and I am not happy with the wired base. The only other wireless mouse that I have had was made by HP and there was no wires at all. A small transmitter plugged into the USB port and it stuck out about an inch; very neat. When I moved the laptop the little transmitter stored neatly inside the mouse.
5,Great Quality Lid,"I'm so glad I bought this lid. It is perfect for my 13"" Lodge cast iron skillet. I love the high domed lid as well. Lots of room to cook in."
1,"Nice idea, but poorly manufactured.","I thought these were so perfect when I first spotted them in The Container Store. I got a couple, but then thought I needed more, so I purchased five more here.It took a few weeks to realize that they literally come apart (the plastic plates are not riveted to each other) easily, and all of the pieces fall apart. You then have to assemble it back together, only to have it shear apart again. I needed to literally tape the halves together after being continually frustrated.So, I do not recommend you get these. They are more of a hassle than they are worth in ""clever."""
2,"Runs Small, Too Many Pieces, Bad Trunk","The costumes run very small. It says for 3+, but they will barely fit a 3-year-old. (Odd, considering the shoes are huge!!)I bought them for my 4-year-old, and we'll only get a few months' use out of them.It was made cheaply, so the sleeves aren't even on the costumes - I finally pinned them on, b/c they're always falling off.Don't expect the trunk to stay together."
1,disappointed Grandmother,"Boy, do I wish I had read the reviews on this dress up trunk before purchasing them for two of my Granddaughters. I couldn't believe it when I watched them open their presents. Little pieces of scrap materials make up the costumes, most of them too small for even a three year old (and it is advertised for 3 an up???. The crown was so huge and the witch hat couldn't begin to fit on their heads. The girls were happy enough, but I was very disappointed. I learned my lesson, and will definitely read reviews before purchasing on line again."
1,"very poor quality, impossible for child to put on independently","These costumes are extremely overpriced. The shoes broke instantly before my daughter even put them on. The dresses come in shirt and skirt form,however the sleeves are unattached as a seperate piece and there is no way my daugther could begin to get them on herself, especially over clothes. Also my daugther is 2.5 yrs old and very petite and the costumes are very tight. She will outgrow them in the next six months. Skip this set and just buy a dorothy and witch costume."
2,For the Wizard of Oz Obsessed,"My girls are obsessed with The Wizard of Oz and not a day goes by that they aren't wearing some part of these costumes. However, they are the cheapest costumes out there and it shows. The ruby slippers broke the first day, without being mistreated at all! My daughter was walking across the carpeted den and the shoes snapped in half. (She is 4 and small for her age.) The Glinda costume ripped in a week. The ""shirts"" are too small, even for my 2-year old. It is not ""one size fits all"" and the sizes are not consistent, as the Dorothy dress is huge and would fit a 7-year old. The witch's hat doesn't even fit the head of my children's baby dolls (too small). If your kids are obsessed like mine, I would bite the bullet and buy a different product that is better made and will last longer."
1,Just bad,"I also feel misled by the other reviews because this story is awful. The only reason I read to the end was to see if someone would redeem themselves enough to be the hero of the story. I wasted my time. There is no one to like in this book. The tag line asks ""which side will you be on?"" and the answer is neither. The gay celebrities fund radical militants who use violence to avenge the wrongs suffered by the gay community. And the straight FBI agent is a homophobic jerk. There is no love story here - in spite of what the editorial review from IN Los Angeles says. The whole thing is just depressing and unbelievable and the ending is both icky and ridiculous. The two characters involved - which I already disliked - manage to sink even lower. Don't waste your time on this book."
3,A standard stand,"This stand works really well, but is very light, that's why I recommend using it with sandbags. I like the fact that it has springs inside, it's very helpful in case one of the bolts is not tighten well enough and falls, it helps to absorb the impact therefore protecting the lights."
2,Uh.. no,"I love these Amazon reviews, and hate to write a negative one.Bought this model about a year ago, due to low cost and other reviews.. shortly thereafter, the ""spring"" feature fell apart internally. Then (and now), the top of this spins with the lightest touch (or even if it is mildly unbalanced) - so, the light doesn't stay aimed where it is pointed. Duck tape works to hold the top from spinning - but, really now... it should be much more robust."
4,"Sturdy, but....","I bought this as a second light stand to hoist my second 430ex flash unit. I already own a bogen 3373 retractable 5-piece light stand, which is pretty light, and fits very well into my backpack. Now this Westcott stand iself is pretty light and the construction seems pretty durable.However, I was concerned to note that it does not collapse down to the size of the Bogen light stand,which seems a pain in the neck, considering how portable I wanted to be. I may have to end up buying another bag if I need to lug it outdoors.I know they don't make claims on the product description, but somehow I was not able to get this information either from the reviews, or from the product specifications, online. Nonetheless, the product holds my savage umbrella pretty well, and is definitely a great deal at half the price of the Bogen light stand."
4,Its a great stand just not compact enough,This stand is wonderful. I didn't have issues with the internal springs although I don't force the stand down on top of them either. I use them as a bounce for when I'm packing up. They are very lightweight but don't swing when I place my lighting units ontop. I use either novatron strobe heads or mith vector hot lamp units.I would say these collapse to about 38 inches. Even if I collapsed them all the way with the springs compressed the stand would not fit into my novatron case which is 36 inches long. So I had to pick up a carrying bag but I had to get one anyway for portable backdrop stands & pole.But they area great stand for the price. I luv them.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Terrible as a walker, OK just to ride. The music and electronics are OK, but I was looking for a walker. This is an expensive ride-on. There is really not enough space between the seat for my daughter to walk with this. It is too lightweight and rolled too fast with her pushing it. She also hunched over to reach the steering wheel while standing. I prefer that she walks holding my hand and standing straight up instead of using this toy. The steering wheel does not turn the wheels which are very cheap plastic. I will be returning it asap."
5,Love it!!,My daughter got this toy for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. She is now 9 months old and she loves pushing and pulling everything on it. She just can't get enough of us pushing her around the house and also walking with it. Thanks Grandma and Grandpa for a great gift!
4,crusin' fun!,My twin 9 month old boys received this as a gift and love to walk along with it. My husband and I put them on it and push them around because they haven't figured out how to ride it on their own and they love just doing that and turning the stearing wheel as they go. The music is great and they love to watch the lights go off and lift the hood!
2,so-so,"We got this for our daughter at the end of her 8th month, and she started walking 3 days after she turned 9 months. She used it about 2 months and hasn't touched it since (she is now 22 months old). The sound was very annoying and I never replaced the batteries after the first time they went dead. My daughter obviously didn't miss the noise either..."
2,Fun but front of face peals off,"My 10 month old daughter loved this toy, but then I found something in her mouth. It was the black and white sticker that has the smile on the front of the walker. I had only turned away from my child for a moment, and I was totally shocked when I realized what was actually in her mouth. When I looked closer at the toy I realized that ‘The Abc’s under the lights, the eyes and the smile on the front of the car’ are all stickers that are put on by the manufacturer. I was so surprised on how easily these pealed off. I had only had the toy for a few weeks. My child liked to ride on it, but I was afraid that the other stickers would come off on it so I ended up returning the product."
3,Okay,"This book came to me all messed up. The pages were written on, the front and back cover was creased. What's inside was the book was good, but not the condition that the book came in."
3,Starting to wear thin,"The outcome of Scofield's plans are becoming far to predictable, not to mention annoying. The ongoing blunder's remind me all too much of the CTU in ""24"". I still like most of the folks involved in the story so that helps keep me interested. Hoping for some closure in season four, but fear more mistakes and bad decisons will weaken the storyline."
4,Plane jane superb,"Awesome series , never gets boring and always has a gripping end so it will make u want more...really good screenplay and story."
4,Prison Break 3,This is a series that I hardly ever miss and then can't wait for it to come out on DVD!
5,Prison Break 3,Prison Break - Season 3This was more action of what I expected and as alwys leaves you wanting more. Excellent
3,Overpriced!!!,"First off, not enough episodes for the price. I think they realize people want complete collections so they will pay anything. Not me.You shouldnt either, this season lacked the edge of your seat cliffhangers as the first two seasons. too much time was spent trying to convince us how bad the prison was rather then concentratiting on characters and plots.This is a show that would be hard to keep fresh and exciting.It's like a modern Gilligans Island. They should have quit after season 2. i'm sure season 4 will be the last."
2,Not the best season,"Even though there's a technical reason (The writer's guild strike) for this season to be shortened, the character's development and the episodes felt half baked and rushed.Lot of shortcomings and missing opportunities for ""good moments"" during this season which was an overall major letdown when you compare it to the masterpiece that was season 1.I don't recommend purchasing this season, I strongly suggest to just rent it."
3,Nowhere near as good.,First off there are only 13 episodes in this pack which I did'nt realise until I had purchased and yet the price does not reflect this.The show is still good although I would have expected it to be more gritty with the characters imprisoned in Panama.3 stars overall.
3,Prison Break - The Third Season,"The third season of Prison Break was good television but lacked the key element that existed in seasons one and two and that was Michael's connection to the people around him. In season three Michael is again jailed but with characters that neither he, nor the viewer, really care about. In addition, some characters (not those killed off in the second year of the series)are gone due to the actors' contract disputes and/or accepting spots in other series. Finally, the writer's strike left the series with only half a year and although there is some resolution, overall, it felt weak because it was never intended to be the season finale. Will I buy it? Yes, because it builds hopefully to a better fourth season but as a stand-alone year the third season lacks the plotting quality of seasons one and two."
5,Vice Squad,"This Cd is a must. It has many great punk songs on it, Killing Time, Take It Or Leave IT just to name a few. If you haven't heard of Vice Squad, you're missing out. This is a album great to add to your punk collection."
3,Earlyears Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I purchased Earlyears Taggies Big Soft Blocks for my daughter. We, my husband & I, added this product to her First Christmas Wish List but she didn't receive it. We read awesome reviews for Earlyears Taggies Big Soft Blocks, and because our daughter was fond of grabbing and teething on tags, we thought it'd be an awesome purchase for her. Unfortunately, she's never cared for it. The red/white/black block almost never keeps it's shape. She'll grab the blocks and toss them from her play space but that's the most interaction we've seen her have with it. Oh well."
4,"One mislabeled track, otherwise a good deal","I've already reviewed some other CDs in this series, and most of my comments apply here too. But this one has one serious problem.If you're getting this CD because you want track #6, billed as ""My Adobe Hacienda,"" don't. It's mislabeled; this track is really a version of ""Serenade of the Bells,"" different from the one on track #21. And this version is also available in the 1948 disc of this series, strangely.Other than that, this is a nice collection of hits of the year 1947. Since the ASV-Living Era year-CDs have been discontinued, this series, by Dynamic, fills a need. Just like the others in the series that I've reviewed, it doesn't have the great liner notes that ASV-Living Era had, or in fact any liner notes at all, but it's very inexpensive, which makes that forgivable. The price will excuse most of the defects."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","Nice packaging and liner notes but this is mostly the same old stuff that has been floating around on boots or semi-legitimate releases for years.Unfortunately there was no magic remastering applied so the crummy sounding stuff still sounds crummy.One bright spot: I had never heard the Vancouver material before and it is pretty darn good, very listenable."
4,Great Value,I had my first unit for over five years of heavy use before thebearings began to sound like they might be going. I bought a second just to make sure that I have a backup. I especially find the gutter cleaning extension attachment to be a great product and it saves me hour on the ladder when the leaves fall. I'd recomment to anyone.
5,Tough as nails!,"Awesome case for the Zune. If you think your Zune is strong enough without a case then why are you looking for a case? I'm a U.S. Marine deployed to Iraq, and this case has stood up to some pretty harsh treatment. I decided I would replace this case, after I scratched it up pretty bad from the sand, and it being scraped on concrete, and who knows what else, so I ordered a ""Brushed Aluminum"" case, and it was absolute crap, I ended up buying another Belkin case. When I took my Zune out of the Belkin case looked like it was brand new out of the box. The case adds a little bit of bulk to the Zune, but it is well worth the Durability, so if Durability is what your looking for in a case this it the one for you. Some of the other reviews reported that this case made it tough to navigate with the buttons, but I had absolutely no problems, but then again I previously had an Ipod, which I always thought was a pain in the rear to navigate with the stupid little roller touch pad."
4,Tent is a real tent.,"Of course this is a nice tent for the money - that's first. But it will keep the elements out and is very study and simple to use. You don't have to worry about the aluminum poles snapping or the thick tarp material leaking if it is wet outside. There are no frills though, no vestibule for cooking or storing gear. If you want cover for that - rig a tarp or something. The tent is for sleeping only and two is a tight fit, but that's okay if you are just sleeping. The weight of 4 pounds makes it a good backpacking tent as well. The corners of the tent must be staked down and guy lines must be used for the tent to work - so be ready for that. You might want to get nicer stakes if the ground is going to be a problem."
3,Not as sure as I thought it would be...,"My 14 month old son loves music and playing with balls so I thought the Drop & Roar Dinosaur would be a sure hit. While he does like playing with it at times, he prefers his Fisher-Price Jungle Friends Tree House. He does like activating the music by pushing the levers in the holes, and does like rolling the balls around the room...but he gets little fun from using the balls with the dinosaur. The balls do get stuck and back up in the middle hole, but overall the quality of the product is good. The music isn't too loud or grating, and the lights are colorful."
3,Are you kidding????,We bought this a year or so ago for our oldest. Now both the boys play with it. It was well worth the money....however when I stumbled upon it listed on here...I was SHOCKED. $89???!!!! It is on sale at toysrus for $25. How can these other stores be so obnoxious as to sell this toy for more than twice that???
3,Good for 2 weeks,"My 9 month old enjoys playing with it, only for the music. The first week it was exciting that he was learning to put the balls in the holes. But now he figured out all he has to do is push the thing that makes the music play. Now that is all he does, or uses it to try and stand up.We have it up against a wall to prevent it from tipping. The balls are great though- he loves to bang them together! He also has the blocks like the balls- which he loves. Also- the balls ALWAYS get stuck in the middle hole and you have to fish them out of the dinosaur."
1,This toy needs a recall!,"My 1 year old grandson tried to stand up on it and his foot went into one of the holes. His foot got lodged in it and his father had to saw through the plastic in order to get his foot out. It was a nightmare for the baby and his parents! This toy needs a recall! When you read the reviews and there are at least 4-5 comments that a child got a hand, arm or foot stuck inside it, it should be recalled and it needs to be redesigned if the company wants to sell it!"
4,"great toy, got it for $10 at WalMart","This is a great toy. Even the 3 1/2 year old still loves it. The 11 month old is enthralled.It's really difficult to find replacement balls, though, so don't lose the ones that come with it! SHop around. $300 is ridiculous. It's been around 4 years, and it's durable enough that a used one or an old one would work fine. They won't stop at balls. THey'll start putting blocks, toys, marshmallows.. you name it! into those little holes to figure out how they work. Even the cat gets into it!"
2,Not impressed with the dinosaur,"I bought this for my first child when she was sitting on her own. Other than attempting to eat the small dinos on top, she showed little interest in this toy. I brought it in and out of our play area for the following year hoping at some point she would be interested. No luck. I now have a 7 month old who is similarily disinterested with the dinosaur. Definitely not one I would recommend."
3,Fun at Times,"The dinosaur design is very cute and colorful. It plays real fun sounds for each individual hole. My daughter loves to play with it when the balls actually comes back out. Instead, she uses it for a ladder when she can't get the balls from getting stuck inside. Hopefully, it would work better for others."
3,balls all over your house,"The dinosaur was fun for my little guy, but the balls come flying out and go under coffee tables and furniture, so we are forever fetching them out of uncomfortable and dirty places. Works best in an enclosed environment."
2,No ball storage?,"I feel like I'm missing something - where do you keep the balls when it's not in use? They seem to disappear under couches, etc. when not actively being played with. This toy does too little to be worth the space it takes up and the money...get a shape sorter or something similar instead!"
3,"Ok Toy, But It Tips Over","My son received this last Christmas when he was six months old. At that time he really like the dinosaurs that stick up out of the top. He kept trying to get them and within a few days he had learned to pull himself up so that he could reach them. At first I was excited that this toy helped teach him to pull up, BUT when he would pull up on it, it would tip over. So you had to sit there and hold it the whole time he was playing with it. Once he got older he liked putting the balls in the holes, but overall he never really played with it much."
5,satisfied mum,I purchased this gift for my new baby granddaughter and her mum said it was great.Very quick delivery as I live in the UK and my daughter in USA.She received the gift within 3 days.Great sevice.
1,fun - but not safe,"My eight month old son really enjoys playing with this toy. This morning, he grasped the top of it and pulled himself up to stand. He was so proud of himself, smiling at me -- then, the whole thing toppled forward and his little face went smashing into the floor. Now I need to figure out how to return and buy a toy that ISN'T going to knock out his brand new teeth."
4,7 years and going strong,"I bought this thing like 7 years ago. A reconditioned model at that. I store it right and every year it starts fine, works fine. It was cheap, and does a fine job. I'd buy again."
4,JSA + Geoff Johns = Excellent,Once again Geoff Johns brings these characters to life in an excellent trade collection.Black Adam takes over a fictional middle eastern country that he originated from. The people view him as a savior and the rest of the world a menace.It is an excellent example of anti-hero and shades of grey for comic characters.Great read and I am looking forward to the overall resolution.
5,"Nice Smell, Kid Safe","We just toddler-proofed our house by removing dangerous chemicals from reach. The harsher products are now on a high shelf in the garage and we only have gentle cleaners like this inside. Given that we are potty training, there are a lot of messes to clean. We bought a big box of these and have one on hand in just about every room. It smells nice and comes in an nice bottle compared to other cleansers."
4,Great product,"This is one of the best kitchen cleaners I've used. It smells great. It seems less harsh but I guess the smell of lavender covers up the smell of whatever else goes into the making of the product. It cleans easily with paper towels. Cuts through grease on kitchen countertops and I even used to use it on my white stove top. However, I recently moved into an apartment with a black stovetop and find it does not work in giving a streak-free cleanse. It cleans the stove. Yes. But leaves swipe marks all over. Guess this works well for glass stove tops and white stove tops. And in general, everything else!"
2,Really?,"We received this toy second hand, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why it would cost well over $100?! Am I missing something?I agree with all the previous reviews about how it lacks any sort of stability.I think my child could crawl through a box, with a toy hanging from it, while I play music and achieve all that this ridiculously over priced toy can help her achieve.$129.99? REALLY???"
3,Tunnel of fun,My daughter loves the activity tunnel and play wall. She is a little big for her age and the tunnel sometimes moves but nothing that would or has caused any problems. She is very tall and her head hits the top of the tunnel when she sits in it but she loves it so who cares. It is a great toy both her and I enjoy playing with. Assembly was easy and quick.
2,Purchased Blindly,This was a gift and did not see any reviews on this item! Wondering if the parents are going to hate me if they read the existing reviews.Now i have spent money on this item and have to spend more to make up for the bad purchase that i made!
2,Sadly Lacking,I enjoyed the book so much that I was excited to see it was made into a movie. It is too bad it had to be purchased and not just rented. The characters in the book were better than those presented on screen - and the story moved too quickly and yet they missed some basic things that would have been simple to include. Lesson learned - no more lifetime movies based on books - it is not worth the price.
3,Good road music,"With the windows open and sunglasses on, this is enjoyable music. Cohen's deep voice and simple arrangements are good for autopilot cruises but they don't hold up as well under scrutiny. Some of the ballads are just a bit too simplistic, he hits a few vocal clinkers and the lyrics are occasionally trite. Nevertheless, this is good music to be alone with your thoughts to or just to watch the scenery fly by ..."
5,I finally found wheatgrass seed that I was looking for at Amazon,I use the Wheat seed to grow grass for our cat. She can't wait for me to set a new pot of it down before she starts grazing.
2,Compelling if only anecdotal in connecting Southern & Celtic,"Relying on name comparisons between the Celtic forebearers and Southern descendants and drawing on many anecdotal comparisons of Anglo/Yankee -v- Celtic/Southern customs a strong case is presented that the War for Southern Independence was virtually ordained from the beginning of colonial development. The comparisons are overdone however, and obvious character contradictions in the evangelized and disciplined Southern personality exhibited during the late unpleasantness is not explained. While entertaining and I think necessary reading it left me wanting somehow."
4,Weed Eater Edger exceeds expectations,"The machine is light, easy to use... I wore the first one out after 6 years and ordered the same product as a replacement."
3,"not pretty enough, colors werent great","The book color almost made me return it but, the detail of the first five years made it a keeper, the graphics are just okay. I wish I could have seen it before I bought."
3,baby book,my daughter is 6 months old so i have not gotten too far in the book but what i have seen is ok.it doesn't have too many options or pages when she is a newborn. maybe it gets better through the years as it goes to the first five years.i have another baby book for my first daughter and it is great. tons of pages and options to write about when she is a newborn. the entire book is about the newborn stages and then a few pages for the next five years.i think the best option for any parent is what do you want to have for your children when they are old enough to appreciate their baby books.
1,Don't bother,"I don't know if anyone can even buy these anymore but unless you find this for $15 don't bother. I've had mine a little over year and a couple months ago CDs would randomly start skipping or the ""stereo"" would say there's no CD when there's a perfectly good undamaged CD in the thing. I'd have to get up and whack the thing on both sides simultaneously in order for it to recognize it and that only worked maybe half the time. And it happened more and more frequently as time went on. Now it's a guess whether or not it will actually play a CD. Plus the sound wasn't that great.I'm disappointed in this thing."
3,Don't read it hungry!,"I agree with what has been said already regarding the sequel to be less cohesive and resulted posssibly from cast-off notes of ""Bread Alone"". However, the narrative style of the author is very good and it's an entertaining casual read. I read ""Bread Alone"" in one day. I've been digging into this one in spurts, though I will finish the last chapter later today."
2,Meh.,"I concur with the other mediocre reviews - this one felt like the author's editor went on vacation and didn't finish her job. Aside from the broad problems of plot (or lack thereof), character development and dialogue (I read to avoid having mundane conversations with significant others, I don't want to have to read them in my books), the author has an annoying habit of heavy-handedly foreshadowing future events. I LOVED her first book, but this one felt like a rush job for a looming deadline. Skip it."
2,do not buy,"I have had two Powersun 100 watt bulbs, each only lasted 2 months and then burned out. I used them correctly!! They should last 10-12 months.Do not buy this product, buy a MegaRay or a T-Rex."
1,kind of pointless,so it turns out these bulbs shut off when they get to hot and then turn back on. Thats kind of pointless in a way because it seems like they keep shutting off and on. When the temp isn't really all that high. My turtle is like wtf? lol
1,Trash,This thing is garbage. It gives off no real heat & it only lasted 3 months. This light sucks. Should not have ignored the bad reviews.
1,Did not Last,"I purchased the Zoo Med PowerSun UV Mercury Vapor Lamp 100 Watts in January 2012, and as of April 26, 2012 it stopped working. I expected more longevity from such an expensive bulb."
5,You need this book.,"Now I will have to expand my Horse-Book-Must-Haves list to 4. This is an exceptional book. If you have been shopping for horse books you will find many that are alike. This one is truly different. The images used to teach are so vivid. It makes it much easier to internalize a good seat, balance, unity..."
1,not sure never got it.,I ordered centered riding 1 & 2 at the same time and got two of the number 2 dvd's. I think that the sku # had to be wrong because reordered the centered riding dvd #1 and got #2 again. Gave up on getting Centered riding dvd #1. So I can't tell you how it is but number 2 was good.
3,repackaged army camping handbook,"I just skimmed this before I gave it as a present. A third of the book is about shooting and rifles. The rest is campsite and hiking advice. ""When hiking through the woods go in a single file indian line, when on a road, go in double file lines"". From what I could tell the book is a re-hashed jumble of army camping manuals and very dated, a lot was just filler, but it does have several ways to make a fire and old fashion ways to predict the weather. I think my hippy camping brother will like the book (skipping the part about guns) but I wonder if I should have just gotten a camping manual."
1,Expensive Dud,"This bulb lasted less than 4 months. It started going on and off for a few days, then burned out. Pretty expensive for only a few months use."
4,"Works for me, but too much heartburn for daily use","So when my IBS symptoms come on, I really appreciate how these peppermint capsules help me calm everything down. However, after two or three days of taking them, if feels like there is a small ember in my belly. This makes me pause for at least a day to let it go away. It leaves me in a difficult situation as the capsules work for me, but I can't take them for too long. Perhaps I need thicker coating so that they dissolve lower in the intestinal track?The burning sensation aside, I can say that during any meal I eat after taking one of these is much more pleasant than without. Any gas / air is eliminated or broken down without bloating. I have no cramping, just a calm stomach. Overall - they work pretty well for me.I recommend these to anyone suffering from IBS, but you may need to introduce these slowly to get used to them."
3,For wife.,Wife wanted me to get these for her to try. She used them for a while and then told me she wouldn't need any more. Didn't really help with her problem. Keep on trying.
1,needs work,I can not take this product due to the fact the enteric coating is not working well it opened up in my stomach within minutes causing stomach issues they need a better enteric coating it has plenty of mint not enough enteric coating to work
3,Good peppermint oil product,"This product has reduced my IBS symptoms to a certain extent, but has not eliminated all my discomfort. However I can say that it is probably one of the best peppermint oil products available."
1,Bad timing,The Surfer Dude Wig has been available for years. I ordered this for my friend who is bald. He likes it but this one was defective. I wasn't about to send it back since it was cheap. The top of the wig had a Pebbles from the Flinstones cartoon. We sheared it off covered it with a little super glue and some of the synthetic hair and he was satisfied.
1,Not one of their best......,"This is Judas' weakest effort. After hearing the title track, you think the tone is set for a great album. That just doesn't happen. The songs are ok musically but this album has many weak songs which leave you skipping to the next track hopefully to find the Judas Priest you've been looking for. Along with Turbo, this album just doesn't grap your attention. Bypass this one and go straight to Painkiller."
1,perhaps the title is wrong,maybe they should have titled it 'ram it in' and had a picture of a male bum
3,Definite Priest Turning Point,"Everything Sad Wings of Destiny is, this album is not. JP begins delving into more of a speed metal/industrial feel with this album. A little more techno sounding in nature with more predictable canned rhythms.Rob Halford is, as always, over the top with vocals, and the rest of the band keeps him aloft. I've been a Priest fan for years, and I can safely say this isn't their best work. Still this album isn't without merit. Blood Red Skies has got some great riffs and some catchy if not too repetitive drums, and Hard As Iron just plain rocks (drive fast tune if I ever heard one).A good album if you're more into industrial music, but if you're expecting the same old JP from Defenders of the Faith or Screaming for Vengeance days skip it."
4,Great content... a little hard to read.,"James Sire's book ""The Universe Next Door"" is absolutely essential to understanding people's ways of looking at the world. Keep in mind that this book only deals with Western thought, so it's not completely exhaustive. Sire outlines the points of each chapter very well, but sometimes the thoughts themselves are hard to comprehend at first read. If you want to get everything out of this book, you're going to have to devote your complete attention to it. Highly recommeneded."
5,Good replacement,Used this as a replacement on a sears garage opener. It has good range and hasnt failed me with daily use for 2 years!
4,Good remote for the money,"These work fine. The range is not terrific, probably about 100 yards or so, but overall pretty good considering the price. Easy to program as well."
5,My new favorite worship CD!,"A co-worker e-mailed me the link to www.722.org so I could hear ""Indescribable"" when it was performed there, and I LOVED it, so I bought the CD right away. It's an excellent CD with a lot of great songs. My favorites are ""Indescribable"" and ""How Great Is Our God,"" but really, they are all powerful, God-glorifying worship songs. If you like this music, check out www.722.org where you can hear great worship songs week after week from the place where the Passion Worship Band, Chris Tomlin, etc., came from."
2,Actually a gardening book rather than any brew recipes.,"It's more a sales brochure than anything. Just a teeny bit of plant history, but mostly what the garden center grows and sells."
2,Works erratically,"My 6-month-old really likes this and I had no trouble installing it in her crib. However, it does not work consistently, sometimes the music plays for five minutes, sometimes for one minute, sometimes I get lights sometimes no lights. No matter which setting I choose, it seems to just randomly pick how long to stay on. It is very unusual for it to play continuously for more than a couple of minutes. It is fairly heavy and bulky so not worth returning. If you really want to buy one of these, I'd get it at a store where you can easily exchange it if the music stops working."
3,Broken after only 6 months,"We had an older model of this aquarium for my son that we got in 2004. It broke after only a couple months, and fisher price sent out a new one after I called and sent the broken one back. The replacement lasted about 1 1/2 years before it also stopped working. Not too bad. This newer model that was given as a gift for my daughter who was born in Aug 2007 isn't nearly as fun and has again broken after only 6 months. Both models ate batteries like candy, and I would like to say ""forget it, I'm not replacing it,"" but the truth is, both my kids LOVED their aquariums and helped put them to sleep and entertain them on a daily basis. I guess I have to look at it as an evil neccessity and will probably again replace this new aquarium!"
2,Very disappointed in this toy. . .,"I receieved this as a shower gift and was very excited about it. I put it together today and attached it to the crib, only to discover how loud the motor really is! THe other reviewers are absolutely right. The sound of the motor practically drowns our the music. . ."
4,Ocean wonders Musical Aquarium,"I bought this for my daughter before she was born. I play it for her every time I change her diaper in her crib. She didn't seemed to notice it at first, but now that she is 12 weeks old, she loves this thing. She is attracted to the lights and music. And when I sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star along with the music, she smiles so big. She is not as attracted to this toy as she is to her mobile, but the songs play long enough to keep her entertained while I do quick chores around the house like folding laundry.There are 2 drawbacks for me (not including the need for a small screwdriver to install the battery).1.) The bubbles stopped working. But I doubt she notices the bubbles anyway.2.) I wish there was a night-light mode. There are several modes: Bubbles+Lights+Music, Lights+Music, and Music-only. I don't know why I'd ever use the Music-only mode, but I often wish I could just use it as a night-light without the music to check on her in her sleep."
4,Nice for Baby,"I bought this for my third grandchild who is 4 months old. She enjoys looking at it as she falls asleep, even when she isn't quite ready for sleep when I put her down.One reason I bought it is that I have had this or something similar for my two older grandchildren - now 10 & 7. I was delighted with it back then and expect to continue to enjoy this one as long as Amanda is in a crib - and perhaps beyond...as I did with the older ones.I don't believe Fisher Price can be beat.Rita"
2,If it's not broke - why fix it????,Nothing like the old model. I used the older aquarium for both of my children and they LOVED it. I gave it for every baby shower I went to. This is terrible. All you hear is the motor. The music is not nearly as soothing as the previous model and the back will not stay on. I was terribly disappointed and will never buy one again. I don't know why they had to change something that worked great!
2,"Was eager to buy, but highly disappointed!!!","I was looking forward to this toy even before my daughter was born this past August. I held off buying because we planned on having the baby in a bassinet in our bedroom for the first 3 months. As soon as we set up her crib I went out and bought it. The options it has are great....BUT...there is only one option for play length and it's not nearly long enough. I have to go into her room and hit the play button for a 3rd time before she goes to sleep. There are times that if it's off too long before I check on her she's completely awake and I have to wait for her to become sleepy again...or she's so tired And irritated that she cries (definately not the soother I was hoping for.) What really bugs me is that all Fisher Price had to do was add a time option. 10, 20, 30 minute options would have been great."
3,Cute concept but.....,"this toy hasn't really caught our daughter's attention. Her overhead mobile gets all the attention and coo's. Our daughter is 3mo.old and beginning to really focus on objects. She just doesn't seem to turn her head to the side long enough though to ""get in to"" it. The music is soothing if we turn the volume down enough but I think there are better soothing lullabye toys out there for sleepytime in the crib. Maybe she'll like it as she grows. I'll update if she does."
3,MECHANICALLY TO NOISYY,"Very cute etc etc but for my daughter to fall asleep to no way. The motor for the fish to move is louder then the music and i have the music on high, and the fish get stuck sometimes and cant move. I took this back and got something else."
1,very disappointed,"I also had previously bough the old aquarium for my now 3 1/2 year old , and he loved it. He played with it even at 2 years old. So now that I have a 3 month old girl I thought, she would enjoy a new version of this toy. How wrong was I. I had to take mine back 3 times to get a new one. The motor was horrible. It barley moved and when it did, it was loud. I got so frustrated taking it off and on to get a new one, that I finally settled on a diffrent one. I purchased a nice one with birds and it even projects a little movie about the birds. My daughter loves it. I am so happy with that, because this one was a nightmare."
1,10 minutes??? Really???,"Ok, I didn't purchase this aquarium, it was given to me by someone whose son didn't use it much. Good thing I didn't pay for it or I would be really unhappy. At first I thought it was great. My son loved it. The first time I tried to use it to calm him and put him to sleep however, I discovered 10 minutes were just not enough. He would just start to go to sleep when it would shut off. That made him made. For as much money as this thing costs, there should be a time setting too so you can choose how long it plays. I am going to go buy one that actually plays longer at a time. Hope this helps you."
2,"Disappointed, older model is much better","I never write reviews on toys, but this one is a must. I LOVED the aquarium I received for my daughter. She still plays with it and she is 22 months old. So I bought one for my son, and the only had the new model at the store and I cannot believe how silly this thing is to put together with the clunky battery pack that hangs off the side.. it doesn't even make sense. It is so much more complicated than it has to be. It does seem to be much louder than the first, so not as soothing. I think I am returning it to find the old one."
2,Original Aquarium model better,"I like the original model where you can see the wave ripples on the ceiling & you can change it to where the baby can see it in the crib. This new one is louder than the original model which makes it a ""play"" toy more than a soothing toy.I would find the original model before buying this one."
2,"Good concept, bad design","We bought this aquarium because we saw our friend's son playing with his and he just loved it. Unfortunately, the model they had was replaced with this newer version. The concept was the same and the music, bubbles and fish are great. Our son loved the spinning crab too. But, functionally, the design is horrible. The battery pack plugs into the back of the aquarium once you have attached it to the crib. Since it takes D batteries it is really heavy. The pack kept losing it's connection to the toy because it was so heavy. It would only play if you held it in place. We took it back and the only model they are now stocking at TRU is this jungle one which didn't look nearly as neat. So, I went and found a used version of the older model our freinds had at a second hand store. Our son absolutely loves it. This one has the batteries inside the toy and it works great."
2,Not Impressed,"This toy does the trick of putting my 8 month old daughter to sleep at night, that is when it actually works. I found it is very difficult to keep the battery pack attached tightly enough to the back of the toy. I have tried EVERYTHING I could think of, but it manages to come loose quite often. It seems to me that someone could have found a more convenient place to put the batteries!"
2,Great when it works,"This toy was given to our 6 month old daughter this past Christmas. Like some of the other reviewers, we had the older model for our first daughter in 2003 and loved it (we gave it away to charity once she outgrew it...thinking we would get the ""newer and more improved"" version when we have another baby). This model is not ""improved"" like we thought it would be. The lights are brighter and the battery pack is the worst! It is bulky and falls off easily. If it is playing and my daughter kicks the side of the bed or moves in her crib wrong when she is falling asleep, the battery pack falls on the floor (and startles her to an awake state). If we accidentally bump against it when trying to comfort her, it makes a horrible bump on the crib, upsetting her more. It is also difficult to use with a bumper, as noted by another reviewer."
1,A really bad book,"This book stumbles from one improbable scene to another. In attempting to create a romantic suspence, Catherine Lanigan has failed to be suspenseful or romantic.The love triangle aspect (which of the two guys the heroine will choose) contains the only smidgen of suspense, but left me feeling unsatisfied. In a triangle like this, for one guy to win, one must lose.The reasons for, and the chase itself, were illogical. They just didn't flow.There was an excessive amount of description of the many minor charcters resulting in shallow portayals of the main characters and their relationships. It could have done without several of the bad guys.The happily-ever-after ending is completely unrealistic and some of the decisions made just didn't feel right. I wasn't convinced that the couple were truly in love and after finishing the book I just didn't care what happened to them."
5,Rachmaninoff's Successor,"The Concerto de Quebec was composed by Andre Matieu and after hearing it live at Carnegie Hall, maestro Sergei Rachmaninoff went as far as declaring Mathieu his true successor. The work is reminiscent of the composer's admirer: filled with romance and passion.Unfortunately, like Tausig, Lipatti, and the many before him, Mathieu left us too soon."
4,Hotter than the first one !!!,"This is a definite must for those of you that like girl-girl scenarios in soft core situations. Lots of T&A, but much much HOTTER than the first installation."
3,Rude - Very.,"This movie is very rude. As I feel that movies have no businessbeing ""morally redemptive"", this is quite good for what it is.I do have one obervation, I don't think you would normally seeso many tatoos on a doctor.Of course that hand held camera is quite annoying, but you donot watch a movie like this for the cinematography - perhapsfor the SINematography."
4,Awsome little smoke gun,"Very neat toy, the kids had fun playing with it as well as the adult watching all the smoke rings."
5,Essential reading,Charles Stanley is one of the finest preachers in the world today. He preaches from the Holy Word with authority and strength. This book is just one of a series that is superb in its teaching!
4,Coast to Coast experience,"I used this headset for my ride across the U.S. this summer (2008). It is the only one I found so far that I could both hear others on and be heard from by others. I even did live national radio interviews using it while riding and people could not tell that I was riding along on my bicycle.The advantage over others is that it is the only one that eliminates wind noise. For instance I tried the Jawbone and though it is supposed to screen out other noise...Jawbone does not deal effectively with even minor wind noise.The challenges with this one is that it is rather awkward looking to wear has parts that come off and can be easily lost and is somewhat low quality construction. But it did work for most of the trip up until the last 200miles when it came apart and could not be repaired.Even with this challenge, I would still recommend it over others I tried.BAO"
5,The best I've ever read!,"I've read most every fantasy novel I could put my hands on since I first picked up ""Lord of the Rings."", and I can honestly say after reading most everything out there, this series still sits foremost in my mind as the one I enjoyed the most."
4,An interesting story,"A good story, created with all kinds of interesting characters. From wizards, to warriors, to gladiators, and kings, it has them all. It starts with a runaway child who escape slavery, becomes the best warrior and is the supposed golden prince of demons. The one who will help the west in an incoming great war. Meanwhile, the wizards minipulate mankind and each other to get what they want. Will the west win the war? Is Rache the Renshai that prophecy speaks of? Read this book and find out."
3,MEDIOCRE,"This first of the Renshai trilogy is an interesting mix of some really good and original fantasy aspects blended with some really terrible narration and dialogue. The plot is really quite simple, and the cast of characters isn't all that impressive, I have to say that I really didn't like one character in particular except for Shadimar, because he was the only one whose thought processes didn't dissolve into utter stupidity as all others did. Still, apart from its simplicity, use of gods like Loki and Odin (man that's creative), and its really cheesy dialogue, there are some interesting situations and a couple of characters that make this book worth reading if you are really into fantasy. Depending on what you've read in the past, this fantasy could seem really good or really amateur."
3,Cute,I only wished she had gotten the doll she wanted to go along with this. She was excited to get the DVD. I find it interesting that my post related to the Dora Gymnastics Doll where buyers were misled / scammed by Andy Toys to believe is was the battery operated doll for $80 but was a 19.99 doll kept getting turned down and did not get posted.
1,A piece of junk,"Read the return policy first! It stated, for any problem, notify Shoplet within 30 days, after that notify manufacturer. When I asked for manufacturer info, I was totally ignored. I wasted $245.88 to get a piece of junk.The desktop organizer was poorly packaged. The particle board material could not withstand the shipping and handling. It was severely banged up. When I opened up the package, one corner was broken off and the other one corner was ""rounded"" off.I bought this desktop organizer to go on a desk. Unfortunately, the desk did not arrive for 7 weeks (a mistake by a different outfit). My mistake was not opening the desktop organizer until I have a desk. It's too late!"
3,Not Indepth Enough!,"The book is OK as a read, but isn't very strong when it comes to actually using Moodle. I was expecting much deeper information than is found in this book. I'm still going to have to spend hours just trying things out on Moodle before I can do anything of real use. It appears that Moodle can be a very powerful tool, but the book seems to focus primarily on entry level knowledge. Too bad."
3,"Fun, but doesn't always deliver","I got this product on deep discount at amazon for my son (3 years old) for Christmas. He was pretty excited to get it, so I put it together on Christmas day. It took about a half hour to set up - it's easy, the instructions are clear, and the parts that match are labeled as matching.The track layout is very cool, and having the option to switch tracks and launch the little flags is a lot of fun for my son. It's a marvel of engineering, and a toy that I would have had a lot of fun with myself as a kid.The only issue that I have is that at full charge, the car only sometimes makes the loop through the tunnel and out the other side. More often than not, it either jumps the track or gets stuck looping in the tunnel. My son thinks both are hilarious, and having these happen less frequently would probably make me happier with the purchase."
1,All hype - no performance!,"Mattel should be ashamed to sell something as poorly constructed as this. Commercial shows car performing perfectly but after 50 attempts, we could not complete one loop. One very disappointed son. Not only does product not work, you must also have special car, just not any Hot Wheels will work."
1,Track arrived without a turbo glo car!!,"The track set is supposed to include 1 turbo glo car. After putting the track together on my son's birthday, I realized that there was no car included, and regular Hot Wheels cars DO NOT work on this track. I called Hot Wheels/Mattel and was told they'd send me a voucher for a car. Only after telling them it was ridiculous to only send a voucher for what should have been in the package in the first place did the representative offer me a voucher for two cars (not exactly customer-service minded). I have tried Target & another regional Target-like store & have yet to find the cars, so I still have a useless cheaply made plastic track sitting in my family room. Needless to say, my son & I are NOT satisfied."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. I wish there had been some reviews before I purchased it. It took about a half hour to put together. The car comes off the track or flops over often although it does sometimes right itself. The most I have been able to get is eight laps with one charge and without it coming off the track. Three laps is probably the average. The cars are very fast and if it comes off the track, the cars go zipping around, crashing into things which my three year old finds funny. When the car comes off the track and zips around, it sometimes runs into a room with carpeting. The wheels quickly build up with carpet fuzz and hair which you need a tweezers to remove."
2,Not as good as expected.,"I ordered this for my 8y/o grandson. First, we had never put a racetrack together before, and the instructions were complicated and confusing.Finally got it put together after 1 1/2 hours of messing with it and reading/re-reading instructions. Then the track connections kept coming apart.When we finally got it completed, like a previous reviewer stated, our car would only complete one turn on the track before derailing.My grandson did like it, and spend several hours messing with it.We also went thru 2 sets of batteries the first day, and had to keep putting the track back together every time someone bumped it, a section came apart.Not user or kid friendly to an unexperienced assembler. Perhaps someone who had put several together would have had an easier time. Unfortunately, this gift was a waste of our money, its already back in the box in the closet.Does anyone know of a sturdier, easier set for kids?"
1,Typical punk/metal band,"I was at a CD store and asked the guy who was working there if the special edition of ""The Young and the Hopeless"" by Good Charlotte was in yet. He laughed at me and said that they're ""kiddie punk"" and suggested me this CD by some band called Suicidal Tendencies yet. Man, after listening to this album I think I have suicidal tendencies! What a failtastic album! The lyrics are way too emo (refer to the title track) and the band is super untalented. If you want real music listen to Good Charlotte, Akon, Simple Plan, Blink 182, Creed, new Metallica, Paramore or Nickelback."
4,Crossover classic,"Alot of people seemed to lose interest in Suicidal after their first two albums which is shame as they were getting stronger and stronger all the time. I think this album is among one of their best, combining the best moments from their self-titled debut and the slower approach seen previously on Join the Army. This album is packed full of classics and kicks major ass. The lyrics are also Mike's best yet as they have a lot more depth to them than previously.Great stuff."
2,"WW2 may have had some laughs, but this book didn't","I laughed, at maxium, 4 times during this whole book. The stories aren't funny whatsoever. Most of the time the punchline is hardly delivered or isn't at all. The fact that more than half the stuff in this book is taken from other books is sad and frightening. It's sad because the author is just taking other people's stuff. It's frightening because if he's picked the best humor he could find from those books, then those books are a pretty sorry case or he has horrible tastes.Bottumline, buy an actual humor book if you are looking to laugh."
1,Shame on Amazon,"This book (just to give it a name) is not only false from start to end, but is full of hatred against the jews. It was used in the Russia of the early 20th century to promote attacks against the jewish population (known as pogroms), as well as by Hitler to construct his ideology leading to the complete destruction of the jewish population.I believe in freedom of oppinions, but advertising and selling this material is crossing the line!!!."
5,Great toy set,I didn't realize this would be as attractive as it is to young toddlers. My grand kids use it all the time.
3,Its okay.....,"Although we love The Little People at my house, we were not thrilled with this set. The animals themselves are great. There are lots of different animals and they are nicely made. But the play area leaves us wanting more. There are 26 animals and you have to squeeze them all on the matt. I don't know about your kids, but my daughter likes to have a place for everything. She wanted a home for each animal! I realize that would have been pretty much impossible, but a few more ""hiding spots"" would have been greatly appreciated. All in all.. its a nice product, but it could use some improvements."
2,not the quality I expect from fisher price,"There are two parts to this toy:- animals- the ABC/Zoo matThe animals are fantastic. My daughter was 17 mo old when I got her the toy and has had hours of fun with the animals. She carries the animals bag from one room to another and arranges the animals on different tables and areas and plays with them for a good 15-20 min which is a lot for a toddler. Animals are cute, colorful, very well made and adorable.Now the mat and the play set is a whole other story. VERY poor quality. Just as an example the seam on the lion's den is as poorly melded together and the fences are cheaply made and the one at the back of the tree acting as a gate keeps falling out making my toddler running to me every 3 seconds asking me to fix her ""broken"" toy. The mat is wrinkly and has a cheap feel to it.So in conclusion, will I buy the animals again: ABSOLUTELY!will I get the mat/set: Probably not."
5,Almost perfect...,Definitely a cool film. A must-have for fans of those slightly off films that exist just off the beaten path. part scary; part cool.
1,Ouch,"People who shared this author's view ruled the United States from 2000 to 2008, and look where we are today.A classic in the genre of narrow-mindedness, bigotry, and ooooooo the boogie man will get us if we don't toe the line."
5,Cute!,"This pony puppet is so soft and adorable. The mouth operates very well. It is a nice size, not too big for kids and yet big enough for adults."
4,More hilarity,"I'm considerably younger than Pogo, I don't recall ever seeing this strip in the paper and what a shame that is!Young and old alike can laugh at this stuff. The political commentary never distracts from the fact that comic strips are supposed to be funny. It's hard to explain all the things that go on in ONE strip. Characters in the background are as much fun as the main story. So many good things to say about Pogo!"
3,A Little Better Outing for Magdalena,"This tenth installment in the Magdalena Yoder series is a bit better thatn some of the more recent additions to this series. There is still an editing problem that is apparent in the books, but I found that there wasn't as much repetition and even less ""wailing"". That is an improvement. But there is still the ""off the wall"" plot and unbelievable occurences (a car lands in a tree when shoved off the road?) Still I found the book amusing and there is a possibility of another interesting character - young Allison holds promise. In this book Magdalena is asked by Melvin to help him find who has poisoned one of his prisoners in his jail cell. Magdalena goes off in hot pursuit of some really strange female suspects. Anyway, we found out ""who done-it"" in the end."
3,Pleasant,"The man who bought Magadalena Yoder's sinfully red BMW, is found dead in his jail cell of arsenic poisoning. The only problem is, his last meal was from the Penn Dutch Inn. Oddly, several local spinsters claim to be married to him! Melvin actually asks for her help, and she has to save the reputation of her Inn.This is a pretty typical Penn Dutch mystery, there is really nothing too special about it. The grits recipes are way too plentiful. Grits are not everyone's favorite food."
2,dog book,This book was not what I wanted. I was hoping for a book that would explain how to cut my Yorkies hair. It has limited info about the hair cutting and most of the other things were things I already knew.
5,Souls' Chapel CD,"The product will keep me ordering more, your fast and easy way to buy will keep me shopping for more. Thanks for a great service and price."
2,Shame on Hallmark!,"Let's see...profanity, including the Lord's name in vain is used throughout the movie. The main character is very deceptive to everyone and should not be accepted. Her catholic priest brother accepts money she gives to the church, knowing this money was not earned honestly. He forgives her her sins, knowing she wasn't going to change her ways. Then there is sex outside of marriage between the two main characters...I was very disappointed in this Hallmark movie! Most of their movies are very good and can be viewed by the whole family, but not this one!!!Not only that, but there was no surprise. I could see everything coming from a mile away....It all seemed to be two kids playing Cowboys and Indians or something...Don't watch this movie!!!"
1,HDMI EXTENDER,"My set up is a 75ft 22awg hdmi from a Scientific Atlanta cable box in my basement to a samsung led in the living room. The wire works fine by itself because how thick it is. I tried to put in an hdmi switch/combiner and it caused it to no longer work. I bought the Tripp lite extender to see if that would work, but it didnt work. At the most I got an hdcp error from my cable box which could have been the switch. I would suggest if you are having an issue with length, get a thicker hdmi wire, or use CatV to hdmi converters instead of this product. I ended up buying a manual push button hdmi switch and that works fine for me."
1,Didn't Work for Me,"I connected this product to the end of a 50' HDMI cable. It did nothing. I tried it at the front end out of the receiver. Nothing. Tried it with and without the included AC adaptor--no difference.Perhaps the 50' cable is too long for this product to handle, but I thought that was exactly the purpose for an extender.Returned it for a refund."
5,Must Have,This is the book that my 2 yr old keeps coming back to. She loves Elmo (as all 2 yr olds do!) This book is the perfect length and does a great job teaching colors.Sesame Street once again does it right! They seem to always make learning fun with their loved characters and easy to follow lessons.
1,not exactly what i wanted.....,It should have been written somewhere that this was a book with no text written in the inside!!!
2,The Big Let Down,"Lindsay's books usually mean tight plots with plenty of inside details about how the FBI works, crackling action scenes, and believable dialogue laced with humor. This book has it all except for the tight plotting, and without the tight plot the other ingredients don't hold together very well. The humor is good, the insider details interesting, and the dialogue excellent. Unfortunately the meandering plot is so loose the book kind of falls apart. Think of this book as a cake with every ingredient except the flour. Lots of sugar, baking soda, and eggs but the key ingredient is missing."
1,PRICETAG!!!!!???,you have to be kidding me! Whats with the $17 pricetag on the kindle edition. We paid for your overly priced reading device to hope to save a couple bucks on a convenient way to read but this is actually a substantially more expensive digital copy than the actual hardcopy book. Were already saving the publisher money through bypassing the physical cost of the print book but we still have to pay three times more. I'm sorry amazon but the kindle is going on the bookshelf and im going to the bookstore.
2,"Well, you get what you pay for........","I bought this knife a a birthday present for a friend, and couldn't bring myself to give it to him, it's so cheap. I bought it new and unused and it was rusted! The features that came with it were cheezy fakes that wouldn't save your life unless you had divine intervention on your side, and the sharpener only made scratches, despite using correct methods of sharpening. This is a great example of a product that will give you buyer's remorse."
1,READ REVIEWS FIRST!!!,"I was highly disgusted with this product when it arrived! I didnt read the reviews before buying :/ . My fault... It comes in a plastic bag just thrown in there, no receipt, it smells of horrible something, it sheds this nasty black stuff. I ended up throwing it away! Thought for what i paid for it (which was cheap I should have known better) would be a waste of time and money sending it back to try and get my money back. I wouldnt sell this product to costumers and think they would be satisfied!! I honestly think there shouldnt be any 5 stars on this product!! Dont buy unless you like nasty cheap flaky junk!"
4,Pretty awesome to start with,"This is the first whip I have bought, and it was pretty awesome. It is small, and for my purpose it was what I needed. The leather tails and the shortness of the rod gave it a good feeling not to rough or painful, and good control. This was just a fun thing to spice up foreplay, and it did its job. I did however hate the smell of the leather, it had an odd smell that was different from any leather I have smelled before, and the materials were decent. For just a playful first whip, its a good purchase and worth the money."
2,what i expected,"The product shipped does not look like the one in picture.,but i guess it was worth it. i will see how long it lasts. may need to be modified. the shipping was more money than the product"
2,Disappointment,"My order arrived very quickly, so I was extremely excited to try it out!! I open the box to reveal my new purchase. I gripped the handle and slapped the tails against my leg only to be sprayed with a dusting of black paint chips. What did I find? That smell wafting out of the box wasn't the leather smell I had anticipated; it was SPRAY PAINT. I went to wash my hands of the black residue, and one of the tails fell into the water, the water started turning black. underneath all that spray paint, there is actual leather, as promised. It's a red/brown leather, but I can assume it is genuine nonetheless.This wasn't at all what I was hoping for, but I guess it depends on what you intend on using it for. If it is just a ""for show"" kind of item, then It's very presentable... but if you have other intentions, I'd think twice."
1,Cheaply made,"I understand that I'm paying very little for the item and as such shouldn't expect top quality. but as other's have said there are several things just wrong with it. The leather is very dry and feels cheap, the die isn't fully set so when you even run it through your hands some will flake off, and the die and glue still smell from their production facility. Mine isn't so bad I have to throw it out, but it is bad enough that I need to consider options on how to treat the leather to improve it as much as I can. Likely I'll chuck this one and buy a better made one if my partner expresses any serious interest in this."
3,Really cute but then......,"This was a cute, fun, laugh out loud kind of story, BUT...Why oh why ruin it with page after page after page of totally unwanted, unneccessary, and offensive sexual activity in minute detail?????And why not warn readers in advance so that those not desiring such a detour from the otherwise delightful story could make an informed decision to buy or not to buy.Is there no way to add appropriate warnings similar to ""Adult Content"" or""Explicit Sexual Content"". or something similar?"
4,Romantic Corporate Age Farce,Very cute and funny. The characters make this average tale work. The characters twist and turn in their romatic feelings and circumstances. A good read.
2,Quick and Easy Read,"This book is great for the airport, beach, or train ride. The writing was seamless and for free it was a deal. At first I found the main character, Bunny Love, endearing. Then it got annoying. The constant harping on positive chi, chakras, energy, was distracting. It really didn't add to the story. The romance between Bunny and Nate moved extremely quickly and honestly didn't make sense to me. There seemed to be other characters introduced that seemed to make more sense in terms of romantic match. Then there were characters introduced that really didn't add to the story, just made it even more disjointed. What started off as an enjoyable read ended in a disappointing and anti-climactic finale. This is definitely a fluffy novel but the author is a good writer which made it bearable."
3,"Amusing, quick read","I found this book to be an entertaining light read. Bunny is an endearing character but overall, just like her name, it's fluff."
1,"Defective product, bad customer support/service","Photo cell assembly is defective, light keeps flickering. Customer service blamed interference from other lights nearby, but the light was >50 ft away from the second light (same model and both flickering). When no other light around, same thing happened. We bought 8, and 6 of them are defective, 75% failure rate(!), making one wonder if the manufacturer ever QC their products. The service then shipped some cheap plastic so called ""universal blinders"", they are in different color, wrong shape and too big to fit. Finally we were told this is a discontinued line and no replacement available. Not a good experience at all. We now have to disconnect the photo cell, pretend it is just a decoration.Please note this review is about the manufacture, Maxim Lighting, their product and service, Amazon and retail vendor provided excellence service and have nothing to do with the defective product."
2,Not Worth Reading,"This book is certainly not the best historical account of the English Poor Laws by any means. Instead, I highly recommend those written by Robert Humphreys of the London School of Economics and David Englander. Cornell University Professor George Boyer should peruse the hypotheses offered by these scholars."
4,Cucumber dish soap,"I like the product very much. It has a great, fresh scent and does cut through the grease. It is also biodegradeable and not tested on animals. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging. To use the soap, one is supposed to twist the top, but the soap either came out too fast or too slowly, so I decanted into a different bottle."
4,Gets the job done.,awesome for its price. its gets the job done (stated above). i HIGHLY recommend this product. fast shipping as well. =]
2,This Could Have Been Better...,The Book Was Alright However The Details In The Book Were Vague And The Story Line Was A Bit Weak. A Person That Can Make Mud Slip Off Of A Car?? I'm All For Fantasy But This Was Just A Little Too Far Fetched For Me. If You Have Some Thing Better To I Suggest You Find Some Thing Better.. ~Steve~
5,Good book on Spiritual Warfare!!!,"I applied this book, to my marriage and it has helped me understand that we don't wrestle against flesh & blood put against forces of darkness! Your mate, family or friends are not your enemy, we have to understand how to fight against the enemy that uses them in the spirit!!!This book is for any true believer in Christ who wants to win!!!!"
2,A slim volume,"Although an authoritative intellectual biography of Adorno is needed, this book doesn't fill the gap. Despite the sub-title, the author ranges freely across Adorno's work in philosophy, sociology, aesthetics, music and literature, and just over two hundred pages (of main text) is not enough space to deal adequately with the material, let alone with the additional portraits of associates such as Horkheimer and Kracauer. Some of Adorno's major works, such as Negative Dialectics, receive cursory treatment, and either the author, or possibly the translator, is not comfortable with technical philosophical arguments. Some discussions of Heidegger's views, for example, are nonsensical.This has the appearance of a hasty piece of work, and as one reads on, the impression grows that the author has little respect for his subject. As a person and thinker, Adorno was surely flawed, but his story deserves a more balanced, detailed and informed recounting."
1,poor picture quality,"I was very disappointed to purchase what I considered a substantially priced toy for a young child to find that the quality of the picture is awful. I thought it was just my tv, but my friend purchased one for her child and experienced the same disappointment. It is VERY different quality than displayed in the picture on the box and commercials (showing crystal clear quality) while the actual picture is grainy, drab and virtually free of color. I had to check the box to see if it was actually a black and white camera. I was horribly disappointed. My son, however does really enjoy it, he doesn't notice the poor quality, just sees himself as a star."
1,"piece of "" "" fill in the blank","This was the gift I was the most excited to give my daughter this Christmas; however it will be the first gift that I will return. The idea is great, but maybe they should put a little more thought into this product. The picture that shows on the t.v. is very grainy. Almost cannot make out the picture. I thought that ours was stuck in the color warp mode (it wasn't). Also the microphone barely transmitted our voice to the t.v. We cranked up the volume on our t.v. to help, but it never got any better. Another negative to this is that the music ROM are too expensive (about $10 each) and the songs are not really appropriate for the younger child. Also, start saving all of your extra change for the batteries you will need. 3 AA and 6 C. That's right, the system does not run on electricity... only batteries. Overall this is a piece of junk for what it costs. By the time I bought all of the ROMs and the unit I spent about $140. Great Concept but it needs a lot of refining."
2,not worth it,"I bought this because my 20-month old and 4 yr. old love seeing themselves on our camcorder and digital camera. This would be a much better toy if the songs were ""kid friendly""- as in, songs they actually know. My kids don't listen to the radio to know these kidzbop songs. I will probably be taking this one back, and it was the one Christmas present that I looked forward most to them opening."
2,Not So Impressed,"Our 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas and it was quickly returned. While the concept is great - kids love seeing themselved on TV - the execution on this product is less than impressive. After putting about $10 worth of batteries into the thing, the microphone didn't amplify very well. Our picture quality was about what you would expect for this price range. Overall, a good idea, but if you are looking for a good microphone, skip this one."
1,Don't buy it!1,"Ok, I got this for my twins for their bday yesterday and it's already boxed up and ready to return. First off, it takes way too many batteries. The sound and picture are horrible as well. It's so not worth the $50 I spent. Save your $$$ and use your video recorder!"
2,Save your money,"I went crazy looking for this toy everywhere. I searched in Toys R' Us, Kaybee Toys, EToys, Walmart, Target, etc and couldn't find this toy anywhere. Even the Fisher-Price website said they were sold out. Some places told me this item was discontinued. Finally, after all my searching the place where I least expected ""Linens n' Things"" had the toy including 3 tapes so I went ahead and purchased it for Christmas. I was very disappointed once I connected it. The songs are too difficult for small children and they are not even popular songs for the exception of a few such as ""Who let the dogs out and the Shrek song"". Honestly, it looks very bad on TV and it's not what the commercials made it look like. If I would of known all this I wouldn't of taken so much time looking for it. In conclusion, people save your money and if you have a camcorder video tape your kids and let them watch themselves after on TV. This product is going right back to the store!!!"
1,UUUGGH!!!,"Oh my, I am so dissappointed. I thought this would be a perfect gift for my daughter who like to sing dance and especially loves watching herself on our video camera. First of all, it runs on batteries only, doesn't plug in so make sure you have turned everything off, even though its not plugged into the t.v. it can still drain batteries, turn off both the microphone and the control box. and put it up so the kids can't play with it and accidentally turn it on. Second of all, The micro phone doesn't make any noise unless its in your mouth, yuk!!!!! Your mouth literally has to be over the piece. definitely not hygenic if you have multiple people playing. My daughter seemed confused that she needed the microphone in her mouth to here anything( not much) Confused because I always seem to tell her, yuck don't put things in your mouth. No spit here, Thank You. 1 Star because she can see her self dance to the music."
3,Great for a gift,"Maybe I woud have been a little disappointed in this product if I spent my own money on it, but we got it as a gift. We don't have a problem with the sound. It takes a little patience to get your tv, speaker, and microphone volumes adjusted, but works fine. The clarity of the picture isn't perfect, but it's just over $50 now. That's WAY less money than what one of these in the adult version would cost.The songs could be better. I know most of them, but the kids are a little too small for the teeny bop stuff. It would be nice if more of the music is stuff the kids sing. You can however easily plug in your own music to this. I look at it as a family activity. The kids won't do it, if you don't model and do it yourself.The 10 batteries stink. Why they didn't put a plug in it is really stupid."
1,Was not impressed........,"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. On tv it looks pretty good, however, when you get it at home the picute looks a mess. Okay, so I figured what can you expect for the money, but the most disappointing thing for her and myself were the songs. The only song that she knew was ""Who let the dogs out"" and all she knew was the chorus. They should have songs from difference genres, not just pop.Wish I kept my receipt, because it is sitting around collecting dust."
2,Expected a bit more than we got,"Toy is reasonably entertaining just for the simple fact that the kids get to see themselves on TV and hear thier voice. There are some neat image options that spin around the image on the TV screen, but the controls for it are on the microphone so if the child has the mic they would either have to do it or the adult would have to try to figure out how to maneuver their way through a 2 year old's fingers to press it, there is no control for it on the console. Also, we expected words to the songs that are on the cartridge to be displayed on the screen...they weren't (obviously geared toward younger children) and while the songs are playing it's really hard to hear your voice through the microphone."
2,The Star Station could've been better..,"It is almost like the makers of this product didn't think we would notice the poor quality of the picture and sound. Did they test it? The idea is awesome! Young kids love to see themselves on tv and play it up for a crowd too. Unfortunately even with the best lighting it is hard to see the picture.. and we have a huge t.v! Worse than the bad picture is the sound, without putting my ear up to the unit I cannot even hear the music.. how is my son supposed to sing along? That is the worse part. Great concept.. needs improvement. MUCH improvement. We kept ours, just never use it. Too frustrating."
1,so not worth it!,"I recently returned this toy. I purchased it before I read some of these reviews. But I thought what the heck, it can't be that bad. well, it is. I figured I'd give it a shot. My daughters Would love the idea of this toy but the picture quality is NOT good and I think I had better than most. The music is really not apprpriate for little ones and they get frustrated because they can't sing along. older kids might enjoy it but will not tolerate quality. So not worth even trying it out!"
1,Don't Waste your money,"I was SO excited about this toy! But it is such a waste of money! The batteries are hello, INSANE! be ready to buy them and replace them all the time! Why can we not have a cord?? My girls are 3 and 5 and dont know ANY of the songs. I have not been able to throw it away yet but I am going to! They never even ask to play with it! JUNK!"
1,Disappointing toy,My husband and I have a house full of fisher price toys. Usually the quality is excellant. Not so in this toy. The picture quality was so so. The microphone did not work on ours. The only way our sons voice could be heard was if the mic was practically in his mouth. The songs are not songs that our 4 1/2 year old is familiar with. You would think a preschool toy would have songs the kids could sing to.
1,Don't waste your money!,"My husband and I bought this for our 3 year old. First of all, the picture quality is awful! We read alot of the reviews before we bought this product, but we said, it can't be all that bad! Well we were wrong! Also 3 year olds don't really know any of these songs. Maybe if it had twinkle twinkle or old mac, or more children's songs, it would be more entertaining for toddlers. So think twice before you buy this product. ALSO, TOYS R US WON'T RETURN THIS ITEM, SINCE ITS ELECTRONIC!!! UUUGH!! WE WILL TRY TO SELL IT ON EBAY. Hopefully fisher price will perfect this product in the future."
2,Not worth it,I bought this after viewing the display at Walmart. The picture quality was no where near what came home in the box. That alone bums me out.The cartridge that comes free with your purchase is for older kids. My 4 and 6 y/o were clueless when it came to the songs. Come on Fisher Price!We tried again today - our first since Christmas. I think it would help if the set came with songs that kids were familiar with. I ordered a more kid friendly cassette today and hope that will change things. My son loves music and this is a great idea. Just needs some help!I would not buy again.
3,Good but could use some improvements,"I purchased this for my home daycare as a Christmas gift. Overall the kids (ages 3-10yrs) have fun with it, but there are a few things that could be done to make it much better.For starters, it takes alot of batteries (3-AAA, 6-C). If I could just plug it in, I'd be 100% happier. Who can afford to replace all those batteries all the time?The picture quality isn't great, but it's good enough for the kids.There are music cartridges that can be used with it, but even the older kids don't know alot of the songs. Instead of using those cartridges I just put on my own music or let them use it without music.The younger kids have trouble figuring out the lens effects, but the older kids have fun with that feature.Overall I like it, but with the problems it has, it's a bit overpriced. Hopefully they'll work on making it better!"
5,Lots of Fun!,"My daughter received this for Christmas last year when she was 5 and she loves it. Her brothers, 9 and 2 also have fun playing with it, they get their toy guitars and drums and all play together in front of the camera. The picture is not the highest quality but the kids can see themselves clearly and is adequate considering the price, and the special effects are hit too. Some reviewers complained about the songs and my daughter didn't know many of them at first but they are easy to learn and now they do have preschool themed sing-a-long cartridges. I would reccommend this toy for your young star."
1,terrible!,didn't get past 15 minutes... maybe it improved but i have to say there wasn't much they could build on. one of the worst movies i've ever seen...
3,It has it's moments,"There are flashes of Claypool brilliance, Flying Frog Brigade at Bonneroo for example, but much of it is bad home video reminiscent of bootlegs. Worth watching"
2,Well intentioned but disappointing,"I had high hopes for this work, based on the reputation of the publishing house and the importance of the subject. Alas, what I found was Christianized pop psychology, with facile references to ""the imposter,"" ""the inner Pharisee,"" and, believe it or not, ""the inner child."" There was virtually nothing said about the great biblical themes of adoption and our relation to Christ, the firstborn of many, with whom we are heirs and co-heirs of the kingdom. In fact, there was a more-than-subtle anti-intellectualism evident and a distinct distaste for theology displayed. The one thing that saved a star for this book was Mr. Manning's treatise on the Apostle John--if only the whole book had lived up to the content of this chapter. A wasted opportunity to speak to a vital aspect of Christian life."
5,The Greatest Book!,this book was awesome! i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. i have read all her Replica books and every single one was the bomb. i cant wait to read the newest one!
5,BEST BOOK (AND SERIES) EVER!,This book was my favorite in the series. Marilyn Kaye has great writing skills. My friend and I fight to get the next book out of the library first. Marilyn sould write 20 of these books!
2,"Awesome, as usual...","Although these books are written for the ""tween""-age set, I'm much older and I still love them. ATTSM is simply okay, b/c I'm not an Eric/Amy or Andyma fan. (Chris and Amy are the best together!) The first is the best, and I'd also recommend you read Mystery Mother."
2,"Good for relativly light loads, does not stand up to daily use that well.",The main problem about these hand trucks that will keep me from buying them again is that the plastic molding that locks the wheels in place after you unfold them wears out and tends to fight you when you try to lock them in place. It also leads to the point that if you were to pull instead of push (like when you have to turn around) the wheels fold in and collapse the hand truck. We haven't exceeded the weight limits on these so that is not what caused the problem. I run a computer support department and we frequently have used the six lift trucks that I ordered. The other noticeable thing is that on two of the units the telescoping rod support on the back broke loose. We weren't even that hard on them. After almost two years we have two left. I will be trying another hopefully more durable brand. They might be better for light work though.
4,best value but still wasteful,"I hate the waste and expense of using canisters, but they are by far the most effecient and simplest form of stove available to date. It is frustrating that you lose some fuel toward the end of the canister life due to loss of pressurization especially in cool to cold temps, but it much more effecient and cost effective to use the large 220 cannister rather than the smaller 110. Snowpeak cannisters seem to be the least expensive of the bunch and so I tend to use them for my SP Gigapower stove which is an excellent stove when its not exposed to wind. I figured that it costs less than 10 cents per minute of use which is not cheap but reasonable for the relatively infrequent use you get out of it. DO US ALL A FAVOR AND PUNCTURE THE CANS WITH A NAIL AFTER YOUR DONE WITH THEM AND THROW THEM IN THE METAL RECYCLING."
2,Top notch audio/performance - F for video editing,"Can you say headache? The video editing switches from multiple camera angles at a rate of about 1 camera every 2 seconds. You never get to see anyone in the band ""jam"" out. I think the editor wanted to avoid being boring by just showing the stage from one camera, but the result is the opposite extreme.It pretty much ruined a perfect DVD for me. The Band is stellar and the audio is incredible. I think it's better to turn the tube off and just crank the speakers. Or just buy the CD.Compare this to Death - Live in LA and you will see what I mean."
5,afordable action,They were all enjoyable! 2 old favorites and 2 I'd never heard of but for the price a real steal!
2,Pretentious and tedious,"This is one of those tedious self-published books that, fortunately, will never reach an audience much beyond the author's close friends and acquaintances.It isn't any good. It's too long and it's over-written. It reads like Kraft's Amazon review of his own book (posted here at the time I write this): confusing, pointless, and not at all funny. There is throughout a sort of painful striving after humor that drives the reader to a lot of cringing. There is also throughout a great deal of pointless obfuscatory language, which was perhaps meant to substitute for plot. It's not clever but you have the sense Kraft really, really wanted it to be."
2,Not very good,"I have enjoyed reading the more current Barbara Delinsky books (particularly ""The Summer I Dared"") and picked this one up recently. I thought the premise was fun since I love New England and rustic settings, but was very disappointed in the entire book. The story was unbelievable and improbable ... it was very amateurish and contrived. I had a hard time believing this was the same author of the other books I read. It was so bad, I'm not even passing it along to other friends to read; I don't want them wasting their time. My advice would be to stick with her more recent offerings which are very, very good !!"
4,Good stand for the price,"This stand is pretty good, but our stand came missing 2 screws. This is the reason for the deduction of one star. The stand is not solid wood, but is perfect as a decorative stand for our swords."
1,Guaranteed to Break,"I bought one of these printers when it first came out and was very excited about the quality of its printing. Then it broke--the paper wouldn't feed. HP sent me another one. It broke. The paper wouldn't feed. Now I'm on printer #3. It's broken (paper won't feed) and I haven't even used up the cartridges it shipped with yet. I can only conclude after having three printers with the same problem that there is something wrong with the manufacture. The printer is well-hyped, but poorly made. Please don't waste your money on it."
2,Ink System Failures,"This product was great when I first had it, but after 2 years it had a paper jam and since then problem after problem has occurred. Now it only prints green, yellow and blue. which is worthless to me. Do not buy it, it is a wasted of money."
1,Not what expected,"I used Fiji deodorant for more than 20 years but always purchased it from FragranceNet.com. They have a great product. This deodorant has different smell, the ugly one. Next time will order again from FrangranceNet."
3,"The soap is fine, but I don't like the bottle","I ordered a whole case of this, because I liked how the bottle looked in the picture with the nice clear liquid in the nice clear bottle, and I had some other Method products that I liked. Unfortunately, this bottle is sized for BIG hands (mine are medium-sized female hands), so it's less pleasant to grasp than any other dish soap container I've ever used, and bulkier on my sink. The difference isn't awful, but since I don't love washing dishes, I prefer to make it more pleasant, not less. Something that really annoyed me is the nozzle, which is basically just a hole in the lid, not a nozzle at all, so that it's close to impossible not to dribble the soap (both messy and wasteful). I thought about giving it all away, but I confess to enjoying the scent, which is very light and pleasant. The product itself is good, but I wouldn't buy this packaging again."
2,lacks the magic of Journey,"This 2nd solo effort by Steve Perry ex-lead singer of Journey is so-so. It lacks the originality of his 1st solo album Street Talk. Without his Journey bandmates to pull him out of long painful ballads, this album is dreadful. There are a few standouts like You Better Wait which has a catchy hook. Most of the others did not match the rocking magic of Journey. Instead of a solo work, Perry should return the mothership of Journey and pump out more great tunes."
4,STEVES STILL GOT IT!!!!!!!!!,"This album was very good. Steve Perry is by far one of the best male vocalists in the world! The king of worth while ballads. This album is a must for all Steve Perry fans, as well as any new ones"
4,We love it..except for the one song that is tattooed on my brain,This drum is great. Our son goes over to it every day and happily bangs on top of it. He loves the lights when the songs play! The songs are pretty good EXCEPT for one song that gets stuck in our heads. We can't escape this song! My husband and I will just catch each other humming it's tune at odd times. We can't get this song out of our heads! But the baby does love his drum so it's definitely a keeper!
1,The Young Land Lords,"A group of friends called the action group saw a building that was in bad condition. They went to the owner and complaied and the owner sent them some papers for them to sign. They waited for the papers to come in, the papers came in and they siged them and thats how they came the young land lords.At the end the building had new land lords. I thik the title is good with the story, because the young land lords had adventurein the story. Irecommend this book to any one that like aventure, because the book had a lot of adventure."
2,Not among his best,"This is, without a doubt, Cohen's most atypical album - especially from the perspective of production. His other album all have a timeless sound. This one, however, smacks of lush overproduction typical of the late '70's. It's almost as if someone (the producer, Phil Spector?) was trying to bring Cohen into the pop mainstrain.The lyrics and songwriting are excellent (as is anything written by Leonard Cohen). Cohen would please his fans very much if he re-recorded these songs in his normal style.If you're considering this as your first Leonard Cohen music purchase, please reconsider. Any of his other albums is a better choice."
3,portable files,I like the file storage but wish it was larger. I should have looked at the dimensions more closely before ordering. It is quite small and low to the ground. I had gotten one before that was larger and just loved it.
5,Classic guide to north Texas landscaping,"This book is over-flowing with with great information. Affordable and easy to read, you can't go wrong with this title."
1,CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP!,"This product comes pre-assembled, however will become dissasembled before you get it off the ground for the 1st time. Everything is held on by tape, which does not hold long/ The battery dies within 2mins & does not lock into place very well, which is important with a flying toy. I got it off the ground twice before the battery was so worn it would barely budge/ once in the air it is uncontrollable & the motors cut out periodically for some reason (Cheap quality I figure). Good luck landing it when the motors are locking up (more then likely going to nose-dive). Save your money! Oh, I gave this 5 stars on educational, because that is the only was I could classify this purchase (a learning experience)."
4,USSR,"I remember this paticular song many years ago, when it was mixed on ""Italo boot mix"" album. Your music is hard to get hold of in UK, why is this, as such talent should be heard EVERYWHERE!"
4,Waiting for the best,"ZYX........ why do you do this to the ones that love you? I finaly broke down to buy this CD. Waited years to find something with the 12"" singles. Still waiting, but this is a nice tease for those that really need a fix. Nice pressing which includes singles of his many hits. The last trac ""medley"" has the same slip-cued best of. Would be 5 stars.... but waiting."
3,I was expecting more,I'm half way through this book and all Manea talks about is how he didn't want to leave Romania and how ten years later he doesn't want to return to Romania. And besides that he's trying to be philosophical about it.That's it. Pretty 'un-entertaining'.
4,Good product from a not so good company,"I puchased this product from lotus foods a pack of 12 15oz bags and after 4 weeks I recieved half of my product order which was 6 15oz bags.I was refunded half my order price but I was never refunded half of the $20.00 I paid for shipping.I assume this was a mistake,however it could very well be a great way to increase revenue for a company with a criminal intent.I like the product but would not buy anything from this company again"
3,Probably good if not abused,"I'm going to admit up front that I probably abused this cable. I wrapped the female end around a bar on the treadmill to keep it in place. Now I've got sketchy performance when listening through headphones -- the left and right alternately cut out depending on how I bend the cable end. I now HAVE to bend the cable end and I have to do it in just the right way or else I get just right, left, or nothing.So, be careful how you handle this cable. I've certainly learned my lesson for the next cable."
3,This is not a Belkin product,Got this cable today. The cable has no mention of Belkin anywhere on it. In fact there is nothing written anywhere on it. Works fine for now though.
1,Product was great... for the first couple of uses,"After using this about 10-15 times, the line went dead and totally didn't work. This was a total piece of junk and I wish I went to Radio Shack instead."
3,Have to jiggle the input jack,I've had this for a little while and it's holding up fine. The only thing is that I have to jiggle the input headphone a little to get it to work properly.
4,A Lot of Info Somewhat Overshadowed by Nonsense,"This book is worthy of 4 stars for what it taught me about many interesting symbols. The authors commentary becomes wearisome, sensational and often even paranoid. There is a shadow of Christian fundamentalism over the text that seems to so color the commentary that one must work to separate wheat from chaff.That said, there is a lot of good, healthy wheat here."
4,Obvious boo boos make it a dubious read...,"I was enjoying this book as a summer read kinda thing, and I came across several mistakes..big ones. The biggest so far is that Helen Keller was the developer of sign language for the deaf!She was not as most of us know, but it made it convenient to fit her into the illuminati. Nice pictures, and the reproduced articles from obvious sources are pretty good, but as soon as you start running into misleading info, then any book that claims to expose anything is cast into doubt. I also noticed some of the handshakes just look like regular handshakes, frankly. I mean what good does it do to have to decode a book of decoding? Take what you have already learned and then apply it to some of the content in this book and it becomes just another vague rung on the step to exposing the big picture. Worth the money, though and a fun read, just double check the facts."
4,MAYDAY! HELP! SOMEBODY! hello? Is anyone there?,"I give Disaster a 4.5. This book is good, but it could have been better without the frist story of the Empress of Ireland. The thing that made this book really good was the last two storys of the dirigibles. Captain Noble set out on an adventure to the South Pole. But when caught in a storm somthing goes wrong. In the R-101 case the story was much diffrent. The engineers were rushing to met an up coming deadline. The voyage starts out ok but becomes a DISASTER! If you like things that blow up as much as me then you should read this one."
2,Italian Fever,"Hmmm...I hope that when I finally visit Italy, I am not struck by such a fever! I read this book for the setting and the cultural immersion, which was beautifully and satisfyingly described, however I found the storyline to be very dark and difficult to follow, and I never really warmed up to the characters. So while I reslihed in the details, I plodded through the plot."
5,Wrap this around a kid and stick him to the ceiling,Very strong adhesive and industrial grade velcro.I use this to glue soho computer switches (24 port) to a wall.It works and never weakens.
2,Not strong,"Ive used this twice and I have to say, it can barely hold up a 8 oz charger. NOT industrial strength so use this for VERY light things."
3,"""Industrial strength"" is questionable, otherwise it's fine.","I didn't find any ""Industrial strength"" capabilities of this velcro. Just works as any other velcro. Price may seem a bit high, but included amount is large, will last you for years."
5,industrial strength velcro,"We traded our car in and took our EZ pass with us to the new car..It kept falling off the windshield even tho' the existing velcro felt sticky..After several more tries, we stripped the Pass of all residue and used a ""heavy duty"" velcro sold locallly..didn't hold (due to summer sun intensity?)Finally ordered the industrial strength from Amazon and have had no trouble since. I am delighted! Thank-you!"
2,Disappointed.,The stop watch feature doesn't work properly. Don't they inspect these watches? At such a discount I wonder if I received a factory reject.
1,Garbage,I should have listened to the other reviews. These things are pure junk. Thin plastic and two of the 4 lights did not even work. Way to go Brinkmann. Chinese garbage!!!
1,An Iluminated One?,"I found this book to be uproariously hilarious. This book is some sort paranoid fantasy about the ""Illuminati"" (the conspiracy that rules the world). Mr. Kinman's ""work"" attempts to give an overview of the history of the organization, as well as its goals for the future. There were two major problems with this book. The first was the internal inconsistencies. He contradicts himself systematically, both in minor details and in major concepts. The other problem is the writing. It is unclear and imprecise, and poorly edited. In short, this would be exactly the person whom the Illuminati would allow to write about themselves."
1,WHAT A SHAME!,"My son LOVES the rescue heroes & we have a tremendous collection of their items. This is by far the WORST of our collection - for the life of me, I can't get any of the Action Max characters to fit properly & crank the wheel. It is not nearly as durable as previous RH vehicles. It has found a permanent spot in our basement storage area. Avoid!"
4,Overall pleased with this purchase,"This was bought for my 4 year old and she loves it. It has gone to bed with her every night since Christmas. I was a little leary about the hair, but the brush runs through smoothly and the hair itself doesn't tangle as badly as other dolls that we've bought in the past."
4,Worth it for the title track alone!!,"I love baseball so the title track is a must for any baseball lover!! The rest of the album is worth a listen as well. It is not the best that Fogerty has ever done, but worth the money for a few, but good singles!!!"
5,"Classic Fogerty Classic CCR sound, EASY 5 stars","When this album first popped onto the mucsin scene in 1985 it zoomed to No.2 on the charts. There is not a weak cut on the album. The only bad thing if any, is that there are only 8 songs. Very well produced and written. I wish all John's solo efforts were this great."
1,"20 by Harrick Connick, Jr.","This was a TERRIBLE cd. I bought it for my husband's birthday. It sounded like a 7-year-old beginning pianist was playing piano, and the singing wasn't much better. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase."
3,dish cubes,good product. It just can't be used alone. You need to use it in conjuntion with another dish soap. In combo it works great.
5,Made my game!,I've been playing poker for sixty years but had never played Omaha. After reading this book I went online (Ultimate Bet)and was amazed. If you like Omaha online buy this book!
5,Chickens Are Fun,I read the book to my vision impaired husband and we laughed so hard we cried. He could see the kids' actions and the stories led to him telling me about his own childhood.I would recommend the book to adults and children. Our grandson loved it.
5,beautiful music,"very human and poetic musical meditations, unspectacular in the best sense of the word.What I really digg with this recording is the amazing playing of Steve Swallow. His skillful shifting from playing of relaxed solid bottom notes to melodic soloing is totally inspiring!!"
4,Heads Up For Buyers,"Since the book descriptions don't list it, this book is a reprint of the Transformers Generation 2 Comic Books Issues 1-6."
3,"Somewhat helpful, but frustrating to work with.","This book's review section is helpful; however, the explainations to the answers of the practice tests are not detailed. I'm still not sure how to solve some of the problems on the math tests. Other people I questioned had the same problem, which leads me to believe that, maybe, there are editorial errors in this edition. Overall, for me, using this book is beneficial, but has been in some instances frustrating. If you can get past the fact that you may never know how they arrived at some of the answers, you'll be fine, otherwise move on to another study guide."
4,Polaroid camera,"It is taking great pictures. It is performing like a new camera. So far, every picture has developed. We have had no difficulties with the camera. The cost was reasonable and it was shipped within the alloted timeframe. I would say that we would buy from this vendor again."
4,Gunsmoke Ranch,"greety men to swindle a hole town out of there money,floods wipe them out , a man offers them land at acheap price knowing that a dam was going to be built on that spot.but the mesquiteers come and put a damper on there plan."
2,"Pirate Captain BlackheartCostume with Coat, Hat, and More","They said this was a QUALITY COSTUME in the description. FAR FROM IT! It looks nice, don't get me wrong. But the Coat was made of very thin material. Very thin. I will have to put in a liner to make it less flimsy. I should have known better when they didn't say what it was made of. This is like womens summer pajama material. For $58.00 it wasn't worth it. This is made by Fun World. I have purchased costumes from other makers for a lot less and much better quality. (And that was this year! I needed a red pirates coat with red cuffs and this is the only one I could find that was long enough.)Hat is a soft foam like material. I did receive the item on time!"
1,Takes a little while to get used to this program,"Difficult to use without a paper manual. I honestly do not like this program. It is nothing like FTM which i really liked. This program is very annoying, i have lost the drive and interest I have had for genealogy because the program feels like a handicap. Will consider upgrade but will also be looking for a better program.My advice:Don,t waste your money on this one, you will regret it."
3,No flies..,"Owned for over a month, has caugh a few little nats, and masquitos and other small bugs. But no flies. I live in a house of 3 other guys and there is always flies. Bad purchase if you really need this to work."
2,WATCH THIS ONE !,"This product is sold as 2 kits - Maxi & the Mini kit for $25. Sounds like a good deal doesn't it ? I thought so too - however, you only receive the Maxi kit andAmazon writes: I'm sorry about the problem you had with your ""Sheaffer(R) Calligraphy Kit, Set Of 7"". I've checked your order and see it was placed with ""Marketfair Stationery"", a third-party seller on our website. Because Marketfair Stationery 's inventory is constantly changing, we can't replace items sold by them that are Fulfilled by Amazon.And to resolve the problem Amazon offers: Otherwise, if you're interested in keeping the ""Sheaffer(R) Calligraphy Kit, Set Of 7"", I'd like to offer you a refund of $5.00, which is 20% off the price. To accept this refund, just click the link below to let us know and we'll issue the refund to your Credit Card.And I respond: Let me see if I understand you - the maxi kit is selling for $18.52 and you want me to pay $20 ?I won't be ordering from Amazon without asking some questions first !"
5,Cable Performs as Expected,"With the Mini-B end, I use it for my digital camera and Sony digital music player. It works and gives me the length I need. I cannot ask for much more than that."
4,There are a few rough spots.,"Upon finishing a large project, I noticed there were fibers stuck in the grooves of the mat. Having to pluck the lot of them out was a major pain in the backside. Thankfully there is a backside to this mat and I am able to work on the different color."
4,Functional.,I was expecting one side to be black... not so much. The back side is just blank green... It still functions as a cutting board.
5,"Fabulous Book for my 5 year old, Educational","I bought this book along with others from the ""Let's Read and Find Out Science"" series.I find this particular book to be very helpful in explaining to my 5 year old son how our bodies work. It goes into just enough detail to satisfy his curious mind. The drawings are cute and help him follow along when hearing new words for the first time (like ligaments, etc).I love all the books from this series. I find them to be just the perfect length to give a little science lesson, but not too long that my son loses interest."
4,Excellent. Great illustrations & text,Bought this for my 4 year old daughter after buying theSkeleton Floor Puzzle. She already understood body parts so it was very helpful. The book has wonderful illustrations and great scenarios and is easy to read.
2,Very basic information only,"Did not contain all the information I was looking for. Not for All Wheel Drive (AWD) or alternative fuel vehicles. Radio pin-outs are the mere basics (speakers) and do not include connections to CD player or wheel controls. Also, the instructions to remove the radio say to remove the glove box - this is not necessary in the 2001 Town and Country. No information on power sliding doors or power tailgate systems. Has good information on brakes, bulb replacements, fuses, engine overhaul and diagnostic codes."
2,interesting,"When I checked my sun sign; Virgo. I was stunned that I actually act like that, some of the facts were wrong...but not every virgo are the same."
1,Re-Recordings,"These are not original recordings so the CD cover is misleading. Go for ""The Singles"", ""Songbook"" and ""Flashback"" CDs to hear these songs - and more - as they are remembered."
5,Beauty that never fades.....,"Today's culture pursues eternal beauty through skin care products, pills, and surgical procedures. But Norma offers the true path to unfading beauty she uncovered through years of seeking God's standard for loveliness. Her seven secrets will inspire women to believe that- all you need is love reflects God's vision of beauty- a real makeover does not start with make-up- lifestyle should be an extension of personal style."
4,Nice starter set,"This is a nice starter set, but the glue that came with it will dry white, not clear. So I was very sad to see that my first project that I ever made ended up with white glue marks on it. I used this book and paper to make several other projects using some clear drying glue and they look great!"
4,"use it as an ""outhouse""","Bought this for camping to put a portable toilet in and I think it is great. When putting it together you have to start with the top poles, and it needs 2 people to bend the poles to fit together, but it sets up fairly easily and it it quite roomy and sturdy."
1,"Are you kidding, it's terrible!","I have been camping for about 40 years. I thought this product may be useful as it appeared to receive some good feedback from others. I received this and then attempted to put this together. I have put together maybe a few hundred tents of all shapes and sizes over the years. This Cabana ranks with the worst of the worst. After a mere 5 minutes I was packing this up for it's return journey. Thank you Amazon for such a super return policy, that's why I buy from you. Seriously folks, someone MUST be kidding when they say this product is great. It is NOT. Please but two 8x10 plastic tarps and your in business for your business!"
4,"Good produce, a little small though","Good shelter, tried it out as a shower this weekend. Only problem was dressing after a shower, no room for keeping clothes dry. Good head room though"
3,Takes at least 3 hands to assemble,"I haven't used this yet, but I did assemble it in my basement to familiarize myself with it. The concept is simple - four long rods on the corners, two across the top and four rods to hold the base open. The problem is that it is so tall that you need to assemble it on its side. When you attempt this, it tends to collapse making it hard to align the rods. I found it best to install the base rods after I had secured the long side rods with the tent more or less lying flat. Then force it into a square shape and insert the base rods.Quality is decent, though the rods are fiberglass with steel grommets making it heavy and prone to rust over time. The zipper and door seem to work smoothly. It has a hook in the ceiling to hang a shower nozzle, plus a mesh pocket. Little tent stakes are provided."
4,"Short money, worth it for the girls","The girls were grateful for this, but they would have had a tough time putting it together. The top comes together at a pretty acute angle, so you need to put some muscle into it to get it together (don't attempt indoors, or drunk, or both).Still, cheapest option out there in conjunction with a five-gallon bucket and that contraption that goes on top of it. Don't forget the bio bags..."
5,Good Shelter,This shelter is just perfect for using it for camping as a dress shelter or a bathroom. I used it at the beach and it got a bit hot with both windows open. Its a bit tricky to set it up. Overall very good.
3,Not good enough,"The first Cabana we received had clearly been used with an extremely faded cloth and slit like holes in the tent! Returned it immediately in exchange for another. The second tent was obviously new, it went up very easily but was so flimsy even just sitting in my garage, I was concerned about it's longevity and tolerance to weather on an actual camping trip. So, off to Wal Mart we went and bought the Shower/Utility Tent by Ozark Trail. Wow - what a difference - this tent went up in a heart beat and was clearly made of much sturdier stuff! The Stansport Cabana went straight back to Amazon. I do have to say thank you to Amazon for being so efficient in returning substandard products - I appreciate that!"
1,Nothing special,"I purchased this book for my daughter who is three. It took her one afternoon to destroy the pull tabs. The changing color thing is a good idea but the story line of this book is awful and just leaves you with a big ""Huh?"" Very disappointed."
2,OK toy for preschool age kids,"We bought this for my daughter when she was about 4-years old (and we only paid $15.99 for it). It's perfect for indoor use on hardwood or tile floors. But once we took it outside, it started to fall apart. Bottom line...it is not worth $60!! If you find it for under $20, then I'd recommend it for a rainy day."
3,Satisfactory,"The vocab list was really long and seemed impossible to undertake. However, I did about 2-3 lists per day for a couple weeks before the test, memorizing unfamiliar words, and I saw a lot of them on the test itself. It also improved my vocab for REAL LIFE situations! If you're willing to sit down and try to memorize close to 3500 words, then why not?The practice tests were rather inaccurate. The math portion was a lot harder than other publishers' math parts. I took 3 of the 4 practice tests in Barron's and received scores lower than 650 each time. But when I took the College Board test, my math score was above 700. The actual SAT math questions were more similar to the big blue book questions than they were to Barron's questions.I never bothered reading through the whole book."
4,Books are brand new and very good shipping,The 16 books are coming in three different times (in a week). they are very new as promised. Shipping is very good without any damage!I like to do business with this one!
5,Ride from Within,"My dressage coach is a Tai Chi advocate.This book combines both disciplines and provides an in-depth understanding how the human body works to influence the horses body. When both bodies are at one with each other...that is when the magic happens...I am diligently doing the ground exercises and and am starting to communicate this to the horse, with the help of my coach...looking forward to the new riding season with a deeper sense of connection with my horse."
3,A Cutting Matter,"This saw is only for light and infrequent use. The nut loosens and needs locktite. Other reviewers are correct that the blade opens on its own and the locking tab bent on mine also. The saw gets jammed very easily causing the blade to bend. I had to straighten it several times after using it during a 4 day hike. While cutting some overgrown vines the plastic handle cracked at the forward tip and it fell apart. I have the incredible Dollar General folding saw and it works much better - got it on clearance for $1. It stays closed, locks open better and the blade is much more durable than the Coleman. The blade is a bit thicker and you can realy power through a good sized chunk of wood without the blade bending - sorry Coleman, but I have to keep it real here!"
3,Nate the Great and the Lost list,"The exellent book, Nate the Great and the lost list is a fabulous story, especially if you just came to the United State like me. This is a mystery about a boy lost a list . I really recommend this book."
1,got screwed again,nothing in the parts description mentions right or left and yet when they arrived the part number on the parts clearly stated that they only for the right side of the car. Forcing me yet again to goto the auto-parts store
1,Steer Clear,"Here's a great example of something that doesn't stand the test of time. The comics contained in this volume were probably pretty impressive in their time, but by today's standards, these stories are beyond primitive.The only people who would possibly enjoy this to any great extent are either old enough to be nostalgic for these stories (over 50), or young enough to be easily impressed (under 12).If you really want to see the JLA at their best, read Grant Morrison's JLA. This old stuff just doesn't hold up.(The subsequent volumes aren't any improvement.)"
2,Cheap Made Crap,"Yes you can hear very well with this product But This Item should have come with a roll of Duct tape and a tube of superglue. Its was falling apart from the moment I removed it from the package, To start the ear piece fell off, The headset size was made to fit a 5 year old,The wall charger plug in prongs stayed in the wall When I unpluged them the first time I used it. This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!! But you can Hear very well if you can keep this piece of junk from falling apart while wearing it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This headset is very poorly made. It dose not fit good, and the clip for adjusting the shape on mine broke when i tried to fit it to my head.This is not worth the price."
1,Check the stocking number,The photo of this cable is NOT THE CABLE being sold go look into the pic's they have and what will be sent to you beforyou order.THE other pic is of a much cheeper cable sorry
5,Michael Scott,"I will be very happy to give five stars plus for anything Charlie McCoy will play on the harmonica! I have listened to at least ten other harmonica players and non have come close to Charlie McCoy, in my opinion."
5,One More time,"Long after the first read, I enjoyed playing mental games with the subtleties rasied by the characters in this dynmaic and moving book. DeNooyer-Moore reveals in rich and meaningful ways the shadows that so often color life's understanding of concepts of right and wrong, black and white, past and future, perfect and imperfect. With a deep love and respect for the culture, the land, the people and the language, the author invites the reader into this time and place, into the life of a family with roots in the soil of the Appalachians - a family that sturggles to do right.A quiet humor laces the culture and people together. Details paint pictures of characters so real that one makes mental plans to look them up next trip to the mountains.That's why, when I play the mental games about so long, I pick up the book for one more read - knowing that I will enjoy it long after the last word is read."
2,Serious hiker,You must be a serious hiker who is in top phsical shape with all the equipment to use this book. Most of the hikes are many miles and some are for days and weeks. My hat is off to the author for having hiked all of these. They are well documented. The book is not useful to me as a casual hiker who is on vacation for a limited period of time.
5,Fantastic CD for fans of the early Barbie Movies,I bought this for my 6 year old daughter who enjoys all of the Barbie movies. She loves the CD and so do I. I'm quite happy to have this CD playing in the car. Great songs from a range of the earlier Barbie movies and includes some beautiful instrumental tracks from Swan Lake and the Nutcracker. Highly recommended!
5,fun to listen to,My daughter loves to sing and dance to all these songs. Must have for any lover of the Barbie Princess movies.
4,Convicting,"I didn't think this would be super applicable to where I was in my walk with God. It is a simple read, but I found I couldn't really put the book down. God convicted me of areas that I STILL hadn't submitted to those in authority over me.He speaks very plainly and clearly. Many of us work in less than ideal areas whether it be the work, the people we work with, the conditions, etc. He speaks as one who understands the pressures and I found the Holy Spirit convicting me of areas that still needed work.There were even times I found myself angry at what Brother Jakes wrote. Then, I knew it was my own flesh speaking and warring against the Word of God. That's a tough one. I am appreciative of Brother Jakes being used of God to write how we can better work for the companies we work for -- if we as Christians don't do the best jobs, then what does that say about who we are as people in Christ?"
2,Never was that impressed,"I agree with the guy whose TV quit during the football game. Mine has lasted longer than his before messing up. Luckily I won the TV. I was never impressed with the picture. And it does get HOT and makes a noise. Today I've had it almost 4 years and the bulb must have blown out b/c hubby said it made a loud sound (like his did). I will order a lamp, but if it tears up again, that's prolly gonna be it for me. My neighbor has a Panasonic plasma and the picture is unreal. So much better than mine."
1,A Steaming Heap of Trash,"This piece of junk should have been entitled, ""How to be an Annoying Professional Shill."" This sad little tome is about as boring and useless as its author."
5,Worked like a champ,I purchased this cable for my wife's MP3 player. The original cable had met an unfortunate demise on I-520 here in GA. This cable worked perfectly. No issues. I was also able to use the cable to transfer information to my brand new PSP with this same cable. Highly recommend - no issues - high speed transfers no problem.
2,No power,Unless your drive has a separate power source this USB cable is good only for data transfer. It will not power a 2.5 inch drive alone. It should be advertised as such.
3,a few questions before i buy it,"hi im intersted in buying this product but before i do, i would like to know if it will be compatible going from a psp to an external hard drive?"
3,OK,Not as good as I had hoped. Only a few I can really use being a bigger person. I think it would be fun for a teenager.
2,No thank you,"Unless you are young, loose, and can afford to go braless, I'd steer clear of this one. The designs are innovative and easy to do, but impractical for those whom modesty is something of value."
2,Some good ideas but more for teenagers,"I have been making t-shirt quilts and recently was making tank tops out of t-shirts but using regular patterns. I really wanted this book so that I could make other things. However I am no longer a teenager so I wouldn't (and couldn't wear) almost everything in this book. I think that my tank tops using patterns came out better. This book gave me a few new ideas. I probably won't actually make anything out of it, but it may be a good book for a beginner."
3,Great club wear!,This book is filled with ways to make club style tees. I have paired it with the RIP IT book and am making some really cool stuff with them. My sister and I are having fun with both. I think the layout of these books is really similar.
4,My inspriation to learn to sew,"This book changed my life. I really wanted to do something good for the environment and the economy so I wanted to learn to work with the fabric that I already own or has been loved by someone else previously. This book taught me how to sew, as well as how to make anything out of a t-shirt. I use this book weekly and have completed many of the projects easily as a beginning sewer. The instructions are great and easy to understand. This is my refashioning bible. I've added tutorials based on this book to my blog with photos for each step [...]"
5,this is a great book!,"i purchased this book over the weekend and am very excited about many of the projects. there are some great ideas that i never would have thought of, like earrings. i like how each project is rated on a scale of 1-5 as far as simplicity goes. since i am a beginner, this will help me know which projects i can tackle right away and which ones may need to wait until i am more experianced."
2,Not very creative,A book promising 108 ways to transform a t-shirt. Yawn city. Repitition and unwearable ideas abound in this book. I'm glad I got it so cheap as it is virtually worthless to me.
5,Inspirational!,"This T-shirt re-crafting book is fantastic! The projects are fun and most are fairly easy. The author gives clear directions and good step by step drawings. There are many creative ideas; tops, skirts, dresses, bags, pillows and much more. There are many small projects for scraps too. Most of the projects are good for all ages (I'm 43) and could be done even without a sewing machine, although it's much quicker with one. What I really love is that you get more like 300 ideas because she gives at least a couple variations on each project. Hit your local thrift stores and garage sales and even if you can barely sew, you could be wearing an awesome one of a kind skirt for less than $1!"
5,Recycled T-shirts...,"I think I have the usual 200 T-shirts from every concert, every charity event, every ""walkathon""....this book is seriously amazing. So clever, so easy to follow. I made a gore skirt out of 6 T-shirts and strangers stopped me and said ""I love your skirt"". My nieces love this too...very hip, very cool...and unlimited ideas."
4,great bonus projects for sewing students,I used this book to encourage my Junior High students to recycle their old shirts. For the most part the directions are good but for some sizing became a bit of an issue. ( it is important that they read carefully what size shirt to use)
3,As advertised,"Most of the styles in this book are a bit ""edgy"" for my more conservative tastes. I was hoping for a few ideas that I could use, but could not. I am passing this book on to my daughter and friends. The best was the wedding dress. It was really quite attractive and I know some young gals who could pull it off. Still looking for a book with some ideas for a more mature crowd."
1,"Unflattering, scratchy, plasticy junk!","The white peasant-top part of the dress is this shiny, vinyl polyester material that rides up and doesn't flatter at all!The burgundy skirt is ok, but the tulle (SCRATCHY) underskirt comes attached underneath and makes the whole dress puff out at the hips and make you look like 3 sizes wider!The vest is of really poor quality, rides up under the breasts, especially when you tighten it. But without tightening it, it falls apart and doesn't pull the look together. The whole idea is to CINCH your waist and this doesn't do it at all, it's just too soft and doesn't tighten well.This whole costume is in fact very unflattering!"
1,I wanted to like this movie but...,"I wanted to like this movie, but I came away thinking it had potential and did not deliver. The premise is a good one: a redemption story set in the Christmas season. Unfortunately, the script is poor and predictable. The actors, including Mickey Rooney, did as much as one can expect with a mediocre screen play. I found myself feeling sorry for the actors trying to make this dud work--- rather than empathizing with their characters as the story played out.Don't buy this movie. Send me $3 for postage and I'd be glad to send you my copy. On second thought, don't do that. That would be like giving away that old junker car knowing the new owner would be better off without it. Save your cash and get another movie you'd enjoy. There are plenty of good Christmas movies out there."
1,0 stars if I could...,"The other reviewer reviewed AMAZON SHIPPING PRACTICES, NOT this product.I need to say that this product is poison. I had the nicest hands out of all my 30 year old friends, and now since I fell in love with the scent of this stuff, my hands are almost completly white with dead skin cells. I wondered why and I found out that ANY antibacterial soap is bad, but this product has the purest antibacterial punch of them all! When a product says it kills bacteria, just remember its also killing the GOOD cells: Your Skin Cells.I just got back from hazardous waste and I dropped this stuff off with them. They happily took it!"
2,"Great themes, poor music","It's been a while since Mr. Hunter released a ""real"" album, so this disc contains a lot of fresh ideas, both in melody and lyrics.I've always perceived IH as a ""rebel poet"", and the man is back in true form. How unfortunate that the vocal delivery is somewhat weak: IH is and has never been a great singer, but he compensates with emotion and a real songwriting gift; too bad his voice sounds tired on most tracks. The lyrics are enclosed, and that's a real plus.But the musical arrangements are poor, and even if the roster of musicians includes some familiar names (if you're into people like Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, etc.), the performances are dull at best.Most IH albums have their ups and downs, at least to my ears. His latest happens to have more downs than usual, but there are still a few tracks above par."
1,Go read the Legion stories of the 70's and 80's instead,Okay if you want an idea of what this new series is all about picture a bunch of hi-tech hippies with super powers in space. Well that's the feeling it gave me at least. I mean there is this big social movement called the Legion that most parents despise as being a bad influence on society and the kids all think the adults don't get it and only they have the answers. And society is sterile and individuality is frowned upon. Sounds like a hippie rehash of the sixties to me. For me this trade just didn't have any kind of spark to it at all. Just a bunch of disfunctional future heroes arguing with each other.
2,Old,"I've had chocolate covered coffee beans before and they were great. It's pretty hard to mess up this combination. (Unless you manage to eat too many at once.) Unfortunaltly, they seem to have done it with my order. The chocolate covering the beans I received was so old that it had gone grey and started disintigrating right off the coffee beans. Nearly half of the bags in my package had powder in the bottom of the bag from disintigrated chocolate. While the others were old, but intact."
2,Not what I would expect from Makita !!,"I did acquire the light because I have every other 18 volt tool that Makita offers.The light arrived looked ok, but after a couple of uses the light would not function consistantly.I found the bulb socket to be defective, not holding the light tightly, so the light would come on and go off without touching it.I also found the beam not that good.I returned it and got a full credit.I was going to buy another one but after reading all the negative reviews decided to wait until Makita makes some changes and possibly redisigns the light!"
2,Not up to par for Makita,"The one good thing about this light is that it's bright. Other than that, it's not near the quality I expect with a Makita label and price. It just feels very flimsy for a $35 flashlight. If I didn't have several LXT tools and 6 batteries, I would probably have sent it back."
2,Makita flashlight,"This flashlight was great to start with. It worked about 2 weeks, then broke. Was going to cost me more to have it looked at than I paid for it. Wouldn't buy again."
1,Battery does not fit on light,"Just recieved the light, but the lith battery doe not fit onto the light base. Appears to be a mfg defect, but the geometry of the light base looks exactly like the base of the drill motor. Not sure if it is a fluke, but some dimnsion may be off a slight bit .. not sure. Will need to return this one for now. PS: I love the drill motor, best I ever had. I"
5,R-lipoic Acid,I highly recommend Source Naturals products. I have this item on automatic shipment...that's how important taking this supplement is to me.
3,"Excellent content, but poor writing.","In terms of its content, this is definitely the best introductory text to operating system and concurrency. Unfortunately, Jean Bacon's writing style has caused tremendous headaches among her students at Cambridge. This is how one student used to put it:""Every word has its meaning, but when they were put together, they make no sense in Jean Bacon's book!"" My personal experience was that I had to read the same paragraph at least 3 to 4 times in order to understand the message. In short, this book is for serious reader only. You need all the patience, and determination in order to finish reading this book. (like us, who had to answer the exam questions she set!)"
4,Robert Goulet CD,This CD is of highest quality and does justice to the great voice of the late Robert Goulet
3,loose lids,"I haven't used this soap yet. I do know I'll like it since I've used it before. The reason for the 3 stars is because when I received the product and opened the box, I could tell that one had leaked a little. As I checked the bottles, I found all the lids were loose. Not one was closed tightly. It hadn't spilled enough liquid soap to return it. All the bottles had to have the lids tightend and bottles clean. That was vers disappointing."
3,Good info but very general,"I think the title of this book is a little aggressive. It really doesn't tell you much about HOW to do anything unless you own an iQue 3600. It does, however, cover the many things you might want to do with your GPS so if you are just interested in what a GPS could do for you then this is a good place to start.About one third of the book covers the iQue 3600 in good detail. I don't have one of those so I can't tell you how accurate it is."
1,Certainly NOT for everyone,My husband and I didn't enjoy the book at all. We found the examples worthless and the advice contrived. a waste of our money and time.
4,Kevlar Review,"Seller was great, got my product fast. I just wish I thought to ask the weight, because I needed something a bit stronger even though Kevlar is supposed to be the strongest stuff on the market. Very pleased with seller, would definitely buy from him again."
3,Worked well,These were fun and easy to use. Althought they came with some creases which was expected they were perfect for my needs
1,I had to return this TV,I had written a big long review on how great this TV was... But I had to return it due to a High tone emitting from the set. Very annoying in small rooms
3,"If all you want is the hits, then here ya go...","Rosemary Clooney was the greatest pop or jazz singer that the 1950's had to offer, for the pop side, these hits were a mixed blessing. On one hand you had the horrible music hater Mitch Miller, producing, or shoudl I say overproducing her songs. It was Mitch's idea for the harpsicord in Coma on a my house. Clooney wished she hadn't recorded some of these tunes. However there are some gems here like Tenderly, Hey There, In The Cool Cool Coll of the evening, I could have danced al night. However thsi is just the pop side of Clooney try Blue Rose, with Duke Ellington's orchestra, and you'll hear a whole different versitile singer! This cd is the best way to get the 50's pop side of Clooney but don't judge her from this fluff until you've heard her with the Duke! Or any of her earlier Concerd cd's."
2,Could have been better but not bad...,"This album was produced very nicely but falls short in terms of connecting with the listener. It reminds me of a hollywood film in which there is a high budget in the production, but there just isn't enough substance. The guitarwork is pretty good, it stays on time and the background instrumentals are nice as well, although some of the synth patches tries to mimic authentic instruments but do not fit well. You can definitely tell that there is some good musicianship in this CD, but being a good guitarist does not necessarily constitute for being a good songwriter. 2 stars... it could have been better but not bad for a beginning effort."
4,She ate it!,"My daughter almost always loved everything I made from this recipe book. And my husband did too. My complaints are that the recipes only make small quantities - as if the child is the only one who is going to eat - so I often had to double or triple the recipe, especiallly if I wanted leftovers. Also the meals were not frequently quick and simple to prepare, nor were they low-fat - no wonder they liked it! For a working parent, unless he or she is a wonder in the kitchen, you might find it too time-consuming to prepare these meals."
4,Great Reference,"Okay, if you want a cookbook that tells you what you already know, what's the point? Yes, it's creative, yes there are unique choices, but that's what many people, who like to cook, are looking for in a cookbook. Yes, the pictures are remarkable, but would you prefer any less? Some of the ""fancy"" dishes, shapes, etc. are in a section for entertaining. Jello sailboats, for example, are not presented as weekday snack selections. Anyway, what a fun idea to spend a rainy day in the kitchen making something other than Tollhouse. Don't be put off by bad reviews. This book is a great reference, great starter to get one thinking about new combinations, ingredients, and textures. No, it doesn't take the place of pediatricians' suggestions or even a general child wellness text a la ""What to Expect in the First Year,"" but it is a good book to have in your collection."
2,I Returned This Book!,"Although the illustrations were lovely and there appeared to be some good nutritional information, I felt that it offered suggestions that were unsafe; e.g., offering babies things like raw carrot sticks, which commonsense as well as my pediatrician says is a choking hazard. Additionally, I felt there was a little too much emphasis on presentation than is necessary for a baby. (I know my 9 month old really didn't care if the bread was cut into a star shape or square, although this would undoubtedly be of importance to an older toddler.) To me, the book just wasn't what I was looking for; i.e., easy, nutritious, safe and tasty recipes for my 9 month old."
4,Beautiful presentation good ideas,"This is a very pretty book to look at and there are some interesting recipes. The pictures psyched me up for making my own baby food. But in the end I am not sure I ever followed a recipe from this book. It did give me good ideas about flavor combos though - like fruit with meat, etc.The author is British (I think) and some of the foods for the younger ages don't match recommendations you often see in the States. That might bother some people. But then who follows these child-rearing books to the letter anyway?"
2,If you have an extra two hours a day and love to cook then...,"This book is for people who love to cook and have lots of time on their hands to do it. The book was not for me, too much work and not enough payoff.I found a few good idea's and yes, a few good recipes but beware before you buy it, it is not for beginners."
3,Do you really have two hours available to cook your baby's dinner?!,"While the recipes for the youngest babies are fine (well, it's not exactly hard to puree a couple of pears!), as the book goes on its recipes become ever more sophisticated and time-consuming. There are meals in here that require more ingredients and preparation time than I would invest in an adult dinner party! And at least your dinner party guests will actually appreciate your offerings instead of point blank refusing to touch them, as has happened on more than one occasion when I've ill-advisedly summoned the effort and time commitment to slog away at one of Ms. Karmel's gourmet creations.The book is certainly very pretty, as all the Dorling Kindersley publications are. As to whether it is actually useful... unless you are prepared to commit substantial amounts of time and effort into preparing your children's meals, only to find that they may well reject them anyway, I would go with something a little less challenging."
1,poor nutrition,"The author has no clue about the current AAP guidelies for feeding in the first year. She recommends eggs, whole milk, nuts and citrus at very early ages. As someone with food allergies, I am following the doctors guidelines carefully. This book has very little to no use for someone interested in following medical guidelines."
2,Gift Purchase,Bought this for a friend who said he had higher hopes for the series. Never saw the show myself.
1,VHS is un-viewable!!,"I ordered this set of vhs tapes from Sammy's books NW...It's simply worn out! Constant electrical interferance, volume is unable to hear...These OLD rental tapes are worn out and shouldn't be sold ---PERIOD..I've contacted them, they sent a second set - it's just as bad!!!NOW - I've had to dispute the charge on my credit card!!!They won't respond to my emails!!!!Amazon - check out your re-sellers...JS in Dallas."
4,Patti Perfection!,"While my own personal 16 Most Requested by Patti Page songlist would be quite different, this packagedoes represent her sixties tenure at Columbia Records nicely. What a thrill to discover her tender version of Scarlet Ribbons...it's truely the definative version of that beloved song. I'm not quite sure how a signature song like Allegheny Moon gets ommitted from greatest hits package like this. But the inclusion of Just A Simple Melody almost makes up for that shameful oversight. You'll love one great Patti performance after another. Detour, Tennesee Waltz, Mockin' Bird Hill, Doggie In The Window, etc. While I sometimes prefer Ms. Page's original Mercury versions over her Columbia years, it's great fun to hear her more mature voice having it's lovely way with these gems. Now we just need Sony to get it's act together and make all of her full length albums available to her loyal fans...and they can start with Love After Midnight!"
3,Nice!!,"Bought this to play for my mother-in-law and her friends, who are from that era. Good quality and a very enjoyable collection."
2,cheap quality,"Definitely not worth the money. I paid extra for the hardcover version, but it still has very thin, cheap quality paper pages inside. Oh well. Hopefully my son & I will enjoy some of the experiments. Next time I'll just shop at a book store, so I'll know what I'm getting."
1,do not waste your money,"i did not like this product at all i have tried every mascara out there and this was so bad i threw it away...it was really hard to remove and got all over my skin under my eyes, the ease of use was horrible and after removing it (whick took at least 5 eye makeup remover pads) it was still all over the next morning which took 2 additional pads to remove do not waste you money!!!"
5,Incredible stories about incredible women,"This book was extraordinarily inspirational. The stories are all about real women accomplishing amazing things and made me believe in myself and my ability to achieve any goal. I was touched by the honesty, bravery and talent that all the women chronicled displayed, and think that 85Broads is truly a strength network for women."
4,Granddaughter's Bed,What a life saver. I needed sleep space for my granddaughter (age 3) when she came for one of her infrequent visits. It had to be compact and easily stored. This solved my problem plus she was ecstatic to be sleeping with Nemo.
1,Awful game,"This game has bad graphics.. is to easy.. no ability to replay unless you like being bored. Bad, bad game. I think there's a demo out there where you can see for yourself."
4,Good reading about hunting in Africa,"This book is a quite enjoyable read about Mr. Hunter's hunting exploits in Africa. He takes great care in describing the enjoyment to be had and the danger of Africa's fauna. The style is somewhat chatty, but it fits the subject matter and his particular presentation. Unfortunately, there are no dates in the text, but my guess is that it describes a period from the 1920's to 1950's. Overall, it is fun reading and I look forward to reading his other books."
5,the Best of the Walker Brothers,I am very pleased with this album. Great choice of songs and exceptional sound would not hesitate to purchase more.
4,The Walkers in their prime,"If you were a fan of the Walkers Brothers before Scott took off for strange-land you'll enjoy this album. It's really the only one you need to buy. It has the three 60's mega hits-Sun Ain't, Make It Easy,and My Ship. It also contains some great little knowns and B sides like Another Tear Falls,Saddest Night In the World, and some other super tear in your beer entries. If you want to dig deeper into Scott's pre-Prozac world thanby all means spring for more lp's but this one does the job quite well."
4,"Koko's Chess Set, 1965-1969, Remastered & Revisited","Under the tutelage of producer Willie Dixon, the former Cora Walton, soon known as Koko Taylor and later as ""Queen of Chicago Blues"", would have a succession of hits on Chess Records. This re-issue of her Chess debut, originally released in October 1969, also serves as a collection of her 1960s singles.KOKO TAYLOR (2001 ""Remastered & Revisited"" version) consists of 14 tracks, including 2 previously unreleased recordings, all recorded 1965-1969, some as singles for the Checker label. Disc is packaged in a clear jewel case. Booklet includes an essay by Bill Dahl, a couple black & white photographs, and track information.This is a great collection. It includes the high-energy ""Fire"" and the sassy, in-your-face songs ""Don't Mess with the Messer"", ""Love You Like a Woman"" (""I'll love you like a woman / But I'll fight you like a man""), and ""Whatever I Am, You Made Me""."
4,Betten than I thought it would be!,"i picked up this cd set at a yard sale, brand new, for 75 cents. i thought, if it's terrible, then i've only wasted 75 cents. i wasn't expecting much, but i ended up liking it quite a bit. i first listened to dr jeckel and mr hyde. it was night time, and i had the lights off and a candle lit to set the mood. some of the voices were admittedly funny, but if you sit and just listen to the story, you really get into it. i would say, if you can find this for under 10 dollars, buy it. i don't know how often i'll listen to it in the future, but it would be good for a slumber party, halloween party, or when you're alone with nothing else to do;)"
3,African-American Postcards,"I wish there was a full listing of the individuals included in this postcard set. Turns out that most of the people that I thought would be included weren't, which was a disappointment."
1,Buyer Be-Ware!,"Happy Heart by Clinique for Women With A Happy Heart 4 Piece Set Includes: 1.7 oz Perfume Spray + 2.5 oz Body Cream + 0.2 oz Perfume Roll-On + Cosmetic BagThe ""Beautiful Perfumes"" company is very poor to work with! They sent me the wrong product and gave me the run-around when I tried to return it! I love Happy Heart perfume but will never buy from this company ever again!"
1,"Boring, Pretentious, and a Collossal Waste of 134 Minutes","Usually I love foreign films -- especially when they're in English, but in this case One Star is generous. The other reviews have the plot down reasonably well, but to classify this as anything but a boring load of crap is generous. But believe it or not, that's not the worst of it. This is gripping drama compared to the bonus features. I actually sat through them so I would better understand the story. That was a mistake bigger than buying this in the first place."
2,These are NOT the Originals,"Do NOT order these cd's; they are FAKES. I was going to order these as Christmas gifts for a family member until I compared the song lists. If you want the real deal and not a bunch of 2nd rate ""covers"" go to the source: The Beautiful Music Company. They have the ORIGINAL ARTISTS."
4,"great for quality, not quantity","Excellent product, but much smaller than you would normally expect. Also not keen that the shipping was more than twice the price of the product itself, overpriced for something so small and light."
1,SHREDS THE BOW,The high cork sides on this rosin catch on the bow hairs. At first I thought it was just my child's control but even his teacher has a really hard time. Buy a round cake.
4,Bankers Boxes purchased on Amazon.com + Other Uses,Used these boxes at work to store cancelled checks but found that they hold DVDs perfectly. Boxes are delivered flat for easy storage and fold together very easily. Their string closures make them easy to get in and out of and they have a place to note what is in them so that you don't have to search each box when they are stacked. Got a great deal on mine and wish I could find the same price again. They are a little expensive right now.
1,Not enough border to complete a small room!!!!,I can't believe that the manufacturer would try and rip you off this way. I am very shocked. Our room is 9feet8inches by 10feet6inches and I was only able to do three walls!!! This doesn't include the last 10ft6in. wall! What size room did they have in mind a closet!You have to buy 2 wall borders to do such a small room. I am so angry that I want to take it down and not even have the border instead of go out and spend another $19 to finish one wall!
3,Very good ....but,"This is a nice eye cream as far as ""plumping upper eyelid"" and ""softening"" under eye. I actually think it does more then work just when its on the skin,,,it does some repairing. You still will need to maintain. My only drawback is that Ive developed 2 tiny white dot or bumps on my upper eyelid. I did some research and found that its called Milia (when keratin, proteins become trapped under skin) Its common in infants. Would I buy this again? I want to say yes,except I dont want to develop Milia anymore. Maybe I should uses less of product? Id like to find something equal to the effects of the antiaging of this cream. The bumps I got may not happen to you.In my opinion its not a money waster or shelf sitting object, you will reach back for it and get results. The Milia is the ONLY reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 5."
1,doesn't work for me,"I have been using this for more than half a year, never notice a slight difference, waste of money! I will never buy this again!"
3,required for class,i dont know what to write here. it was a required for a class i took. sold it back soon as class was over.
5,Great book! One of my all time favorites,"All right, I'll admit I'm a diehard John Brunner fan (hey, I even managed to get through about half of Shockwave Rider) but this is a great book. Quite possibly one of the best current science fiction novels out there. No joke. By the way, the story does not 'fizzle out' at the end, as the previous reviewer said, although it does end quickly. I had to re-read the ending to get it. It shows the Ship as growing in humanity, but not quite in the way you'd expect. I was shocked at the end, to tell you the truth. Anyway, buy this book. It's worth it."
4,Painting Methods,I first came across this product in 1961 when I was exploring oil painting. It was one of the few books that gave any information about the techniques of the 'old masters' Most of the information in thsi book is unknown in art schools today and this makes it a particular valuable resource for anyone who is interested in painting like an 'old master'.
3,STILL WEAR IT,"This was a present for myself. I still wear it. However, the logo is fading and not evenly. Just in one spot."
2,Useless,"I'm a regular tennis player and have had achilles tendonitis issues for a few years. Not wanting to have surgery, I tried this product as well as the Pro-Tec Achilles Tendon Support strap. The Silipos heel pad was ineffective. The Pro-Tec has been working just fine after two months use. Hopefully, it will continue!"
4,Very good for cushioning,"I bought this because I have Achilles pain, and a bone spur. Sometimes I have to stand for long periods and I find wearing this helps from keeping the bone spur in the back of my leg from acting up. However, if I wear it too long (more than 8 hours) I find that my wide feet are a little sensitive and tender across the top of the foot, but that beats having a bone spur act up. I will buy this product again when I feel it wearing out."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"Great product. Don't know why it should cost as much as it does, not much to it, but it works great."
1,Creates problems.,This item provides no support at all. It is about as effective as a sock. It actually seems to aggravate the heel more then anything else. The heel pad needs to be much thicker and only seems to cause the heel to rub more against the back of the shoe.
1,customer services,"before you buy it go to their customer services or support in their website. They have no customer services or support at all if your TomTom get broken under warranty (and it will happen) there will be no way to fix it cause nobody will replay your email. So, good product, bad company. Try to call to any of the telephones. There will be no replay...ever!!!"
3,Upscale Kitchen Knife,"VERY sharp, nice looking knife. Many love the ""D"" shaped handle that is so common on Japanese knives. I find that it can twist in my hand. My advice is to check one out in person before buying."
3,"Great Knife, but wrong one!!!",I know the shun knives are great my boyfriend opened it on christmas day and it was the absolutely wrong knife I'm so embarrassed and angry.
5,SHARP BE CAREFUL,let me start off by saying this knife rules shuns are the best out there i don't care what you say they are the most amazing to look at there handle is great and they are sharper than any other knife on the market...almost to sharp i was not paying close enough attention when i started dicing up some serbien bacon and i took the tip of my thumb off did not even know till i saw the blood this knife is so sharp i did not even feel it cut the tip of my own thumb off but still if you are looking for the best knife in the world this is it right here no better.
2,Very hard to clean,"I use these to crush iron pills for my daughter who won't take the iron drops. There is a lot of stuff left behind in the grooves, I am surprised there hasn't been more mention of it. Since she just needs some iron daily, I don't feel I have to be exact, but I wouldn't trust this if someone needed an exact amount of meds every day.The most yucky part, it's very hard to clean, and thus, traps mold. If you don't clean the crushed pill out of the grooves after every crush, then it will stick to each other, making even less meds to come out next time. So I rinse with water and dry upside down daily. Even with that, I found mold growing in the grooves. So I guess I will throw out and find something else because I am not going to feed my child mold and I can't get the mold out, I tried a brush and then a toothpick. I have to soak it, but if there is still water trapped, mold will grow again."
3,"messy cutter, great crusher","given the variable reviews, I hope the context of this review is clear to the person(s) considering purchase of this product. We have used this to cut and crush large, hard pills. the top of the crusher has to be placed carefully into the threads of the device, but once it is, just twisting the top onto the bottom crushes the pill into small, even sized particles. Just what we were looking for. For the cutter, the reason we are less favorable is because we have other pill cutters that are designed to hold the inevitable small particles that come off when the pill is cut. this one doesn't have a this and small bits easily fall out from the cutter so if you use the cutter, do it over a sink or a place where you don't mind having a few bits falling out. Thus, we've pretty much used this to crush rather than to cut pills."
3,Don't tell your accounting professor,"Fine little book here with the usual wit shown by Spenser; however, ""the world's greatest CPA"" is the world's worst CPA in this book. He missed so far from the mark that anyone with a little bookkeeping knowledge is going to find fault with his premise. This poorly researched area detracted from my enjoyment of the book."
1,Parker's writing in his sleep!,"I didn't think it was possible for Parker to give us even MORE of the incredibly irritating Susan Silverman, but when you team that up with very little Hawk and even more banal ""banter"" between Susan and Spenser, this book is a loser. Give it up Mr. Parker...you've lost it!"
2,Getting Old,"Parker has been doing these characters so long that he's begun giving them all the same pat lines. I hate doing a negative, but they're getting boring. How many times do we have to see the line ""We'd be fools not to."" Not only Spenser, but Susan, Hawk, the cops, Jesse Stone and at least two characters in the Sunny Randall series. This particular book...and I have copies of virtually all the others.. is wooden and uncreative. I guess the style became so successful that it seems smart to just continue. However, I got no sense of creativity or caring in this one."
3,"Portable, but a little weak.","I got this to go with my Dell DJ. Since I go between two cars for my commute, I wanted something that wasn't ""nailed down"". This seemed to fit the bill. And it does, but I find myself constantly adjusting the tuner to clean up the signal while driving. I start off and the signal is strong, but 10 miles down the road it starts to fade and needs tuning. I do live in the Baltimore Washington area, so there are a lot of radio stations chewing up the air waves. I think the battery power source limits this items broadcast strength. And when you are near a city, regular FM is going to overpower battery-powered FM everytime. Good item as long as you are in a rural area."
2,Works but weak,"I had problems getting my car radio to pick up the signal from this transmitter. Power was coming from the DC transformer plugged into my cigarette lighter, so battery freshness wasn't an issue. When I got the signal, it was weak and distorted -- far below the quality of a strong FM station. I also tried it with the FM tuner in my stereo system. That was better but still not the sound quality I was looking for. I've heard sound from iPod systems that was a lot better. But I don't have or want an iPod. I'm going to return this and look for something better."
3,Decent for just kb+mouse,"I only run kb and mouse through this thing to control two computers. I tried to run sound through this as well, but there's background noise that is too strong to ignore and pretty much unstoppable. I hit scroll lock 2x, a number between 1 and 4 and enter to toggle betwteen workstations, it's an awkward combo but I'm used to it after a few weeks. Two sets of cables are attached, and two are separate. None of the cable sets are very long."
1,Does not work with windows 7,"Could not get this to work with Windows 7. Would work on BIOS screen, but Windows 7 refused to recognize the keyboard. Switching between computers or powering up a computer would make loud pop in the speakers as well."
3,Convenient but troublesome,"Managing multiple development machines as well as my basic desktop machine, the ability to switch between those units without having to move connections is exactly what I wanted. However, there is some condition in usage that produces a hang in communications. Since the unit sits atop my desk it is easy enough to unplug/plug the USB connection to reinstate operation and it's certainly easier than moving the connections on the units but it is annoying."
2,Not completely satisfied.,The operation of this KVM is sub standard and was a let down that I could not use a IBM TrackPoint keyboard. This keyboard would work intermittently. Specifically it would work until I had to reboot a machine then it would not any longer detect the mouse or at times the keyboard. They should have included a button to manually switch to the next Computer. I'm was using it in a rack and replaced it with a Tripp Lite B006-004-R. I'm not completely satisfied.
2,Problem with Dell Optiplex GX 620 (Mfg date 03-2006),"This switch does not work for two of my machines at work (both are Dell Optiplex GX 620, Mfg date 03-2006).The switch drops key strokes frequently and sometimes a key stroke is repeated several times when typing. If the active machine is left idle for a while, both keynoard and mouse will be lost. One has to hit [ScrLk] [ScrLk] [Enter] to switch to other machine and swithc back to re-establish connectivity.The keyboard used in this case is Microsoft Natural 4000 and Optical Mouse 5000.Contacted the IOGEAR tech support, and the representitive acknowledged that this is a known problem with Dell Optiplex GX 620s (due to the chipsets on motherboard).Returned the item and bought a MiniView 4-port (GCS1774), which works wonderfully."
1,It worked a week,"Installation was easy, but it only worked a week before going bad in the middle of the night.When I tried to use any of my computers in the morning, the mouse and keyboard didn't work on any of them. I tried all variation of solutions, but nothing helped.I should have paid more attention to the warnings from others and bought something else.The only positive aspect to this is that I bought it through Amazon and the return is easy."
3,Kill de Soundmon !!!,"My problem with it is it was poorly mixed, you can barely hear what Louis is doing, the drums, keyboards and horns drown everything else out couldn't hear the backround singers at all except the keyboard and horn player I've watched the DVD, haven't listened to the CD part yet, hope they mixed that part better and to think I just got through groovin' to Louis on the George Duke Live in Japan and George playing with Larry Grahm live in japan, only to sit through a watered down version of these brothers talent, like I said string up the sound man !!!"
1,Word to the Wise,"You can shell out the ridiculous amount of money for this book, or you can give someone your money to repeatedly hit you in the face with a blunt object. It hurts, but it's still better than having to read this book.As a soldier and a book-lover, I was horrified by this book. It is an insult to real authors who actually take time to produce a quality work, instead of just churning out a gigantic load of crap.Finally, a word of advice to Mr.Anderson: Don't quit your day job."
3,So-So First in the Series,"This is a small young adult book that feels like almost every other young adult series.The Dark Hills Divide introduces us to the Land of Elyon and our main character, Alexa Daley. Her father is leader of one of the 4 towns in the walled areas. Everything outside the walls are considered wild.Through a series of unfortunate events, Alexa is thrust headlong into a coming crisis. She meets up with some talking animals (made possible by a magical stone) who inform her that angry prisoners are planning to invade their towns.These prisoners are lead by a man named Sabastian. The trick is, we, along with Alexa, have no idea who Sabastian is and part of the fun is figuring out his identity.I think there might be a religious tie-in seeing as Elyon is mentioned (Elyon is a name for God).We'll have to see how this series pans out."
1,agh self publishing,"I started reading this book and stopped dead. Although it is supposed to be told by a twelve-year-old girl, it reads like the voice of some middle-aged aspiring writer. totally unbelievable.The self-promotion is fantastic, though! More power to him."
5,excellent,"When i read this book, i loved it, it started out i might say, a bit slow but it was wonderful.You really have to keep reading and it'll grow on you, this book was so well written. Patrick Carmen is one of my favorite authors, and i have to say this was one of his best out of all of the book i have read of his.The two other books in the series were very good also, i was very happy to see his latest book on the shelf Into The Mist, i immideatly bought it. Overall, if you love fantasy and are very picky about which books you read, then i'm sure you'll like this one."
2,Fun but not well written,"I was fascinated by the start of the book and a lot more by the cover (since I'm a designer who likes good covers). However, I was disappointed for many things that didn't make any sense to me at all! I didn't understand lots of the actions taken by some characters that seemed totally wrong and not fitted for the plot in general. Sometimes I got really confused and I would blame myself for reading fast, but not after checking again and making sure I was correct.I enjoyed some nice touches in the story, especially mysterious parts; mainly I kept reading the book just to know the end.This book may be better for children than adults or even teens."
2,Paper cutter,"Poor design of battery door. Cannot close it with Duracell cells in it. Also, catches paper. Paper path and cut poor. Have second thoughts on the purchase."
5,Beautiful Volume Tastefully Executed With Quality Materials,"I was extremely pleased with this archival edition of The Enemy Ace. Other reviews posted here discuss the stories contained within this edition, but I want to comment on the quality of the materials used. This edition is beautifully executed with top quality paper and inks. The colors are vibrant and really showcase the beautiful artwork that is a hallmark of this series. Considering that this series was printed on cheap comic book paper when originally issued, this is probably the first time that these stories have been executed the way that they deserve. The cover is made from a beautiful simulated leather and the volume contains a short forward by the artist, Joe Kubert."
2,STRANGE ADAPTATION OF A JACK LONDON TALE,"This one's about a crazed scientist in a makeshift floating hospital who tries to surgically remove criminal tendencies from convicted murderers (apparently, it's a glandular thing). When the ship's captain leads an attack on the nutty but well-intentioned doc and his quasi-medical henchmen, he's turned into a zombie. Not surprisingly, Vic Halperin who also directed the cult fave White Zombie directed this tight 50-minute film. Halperin adapted this macabre tale from Jack London's fine story ""A Thousand Deaths."""
4,A good place to enter to Greeneland.,"The plots of these stories are real enough to keep them believable, but they are not quite a product of normal life, which makes them interesting. These stories along with most of his other works put the reader in a place that has been called Greeneland. Like Greenland it is a real place on earth but it is different from any other and few people have experienced it. These stories come from the mind of a man who traveled the world and accurately observed its inhabitants in the mid part of this century. Greene also experienced much of what he saw and his stories are not written from a disinterested point of view. His style is very often brilliant (The Blue Movie),his topics are current, and his themes are universal."
2,for envelopes only,"If you ship small packages don't get this scale. My packages are under the weight limit however I can't read the read-out, the package is in the way. I would think this problem is so obvious that it would have been considered in the design of the product.This is useless to me."
2,Not worth the $,A perfectly fine frying pan that has a major flaw -- the handle. It falls off because it's improperly attached with a short screw. Not worth it.
3,Iowa Farm Boy,"With the last one the cutting ring fell out, other that that it is a great cutter. Maybe if I do not repeatedly drop my keys the thing will not fall apart."
4,works great.,The only complain i have is that it feels very plastic . Not heavy duty. but works great and nice blade.but then it was cheap.
2,BROKE!,"This toy did not last long after a couple of months it broke four pieces came undone and the buttons no longer worked, it was not fixable and is now in the trash. There are other phones, much cheaper then this one, that are more fun, durable and worth my money. Like the Elmo's World Phone, my childs favorite toy and the children i babysit and my neighbors favorite toy."
2,easy 2 hold,"This telephone is full of bright colors and cute sounds such as the sound of a frog, a bee buzzing, and a duck quacking. It has a lot of different sounds it can make with each setting. My 9 1/2 month old daughter doesn't seem to care about what it says, she just likes the bright lights and the animal sounds. She also likes to look at herself in the mirror. The only thing that I do not like about this phone is that the volume control stinks. Low volume is loud and high volume is even louder. Other than that she has tossed it and banged it and nothing has happened-YET."
5,"Great book, works on many levels",Whether you are looking for a professional masseur or a sex therapist you will LOVE this book. The techniques absolutely do not disappoint. Great relaxation through sensuality. This book is particularly easy to get into if you are a beginner in massage.
5,Great Resource!,"This book and DVD is a great gift. I would recommend getting the both the book and the DVD, as the DVD will help you move through the book much faster and easier. The techniques are very easy to follow, and with some practice, you'll be massaging like a pro. The book and movie do contain nudity, but it is not offensive in any way, and it should not deter you from owning this product. Give it a try, and a certain special someone will love it!"
3,lids are very tight,"These are adorable, but the lids are SO tight, once they are filled it is difficult to get the lids on without spilling everywhere."
2,Justice Awaits!,"I bought this VHS version of Goliath Awaits! without bothering to first read any of the customer reviews. Big mistake. Had I done so, I might have discovered that this was a ""condensed"" version, which means that it was edited (in fact about an hour was cut from the film,) and I would never have bought it. 'Cause if there's one thing I can't stand, it's having a good movie cut all to hell. And they sure ruined this one! But I won't despair, because I know that Justice Awaits! There's got to be a special place in Hell for those who edit good movies, and the people at Vidmark and Columbia who did this piece of butchery will surely see it."
1,Ruined when pulled out of the ground,"""Heavy Duty Plated Steel""? Really? These were fine going in, but bent like cardboard coming out."
5,Outside Christmas Decoration Necessity,We put up around 2 acres of Christmas decorations for people to come by and enjoy. Since our land is sandy the Coleman 12 inch metal tent stakes are a must to keep the decorations in place. The small stakes that come with the large outside items are of no value in sandy soil. The first puff of wind and they are down.
4,Reasonable Price for a good wine cooler.,"My Haier Wine Cellar arrived in good shape with no problems; I unpacked it and had it up and running the next day. I am very pleased with the product and while it does not hold 35 bottles it holds enough to meet my needs. One thing that I am very pleased with is the temperature control ..... I have set it at the desired temperature the day I filled it with wine and it has maintained that temperature with no fluctuations. In addition to working well it looks good, good enough to fit in my dining room which is where I placed it."
4,Meets my expectation,I own an Stone Restoration business and I use this item to check hardness to better understand my dealings with the project.
4,High tech prog metal,"Watchtower's followup to their groundbreaking ""Energetic Disassembly"" LP is quite a focused piece of music. Talent wise, I'd say they are the best. Alan Tecchio's vocal style soars a wee bit too much, throwing random vocal melodies in where they shouldn't be. ""Mayday In Kiev"", ""The Fall of Reason"" and the high octane title track don't suffer from this flaw, and show a an unmatched technical level, yet keep it ""concise"" without dragging out songs into the 12 minute range for no reason (ie - Dream Theater) ..... for musicians with ego problems, I suggest this album will bring your feet back dowm to earth."
4,This collection is the most comprehensive yet,"This is a great collection for anyone that is looking for a greatest hits from both the early years and more current Arista favorites. The only thing that would make this a 5-star album would be the inclusion of the Spinners duet and ""No Night, So Long""."
4,plent of bang for the buck!,"After installing this kit on my 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 (3.7L v6), I noticed immediate gains in acceleration and gas mileage (from 18 to 22 mpg hwy), topped off my a nice throaty growl!!! Well worth the money, and not that difficult to install, even for a shade-tree mechanic like myself. recommended!"
3,bookholder,"The booklift copyholder is plastic, tho' it looks like metal. I got it to use on my treadmill, but it slides, so I had to attach velcro to the holder & treadmill. Then it covers up the dials, so isn't quite what I wanted, but it's sort of useful. It works better as a cookbook holder."
3,FYI,"i bought a bag by outdoor products at dick's sporting goods that was basically identical to this one. it was 22.99 and came with two bottles. in that bag, you can fit water bottles with a diameter up to 3.5 inches and there is a roomy compartment in the middle that i can fit a pump filter in, and there is extra room for a camera and maybe more. seriously, there looks to be no discernible difference between the bags. maybe you can save a few bucks. dick's was the only store i found that even had anything like this, besides rei of course where these types of bags start at like 50 bucks. with the water in them though, i'm not sure how comfortable it will be out hiking in for long periods. it would be cool if the entire straps were padded. perhaps there are better options, but i went with this thinking it would be the most effective. i'm sure bladder packs are more comfy but i don't want to be sucking and biting on plastic all day. plain ol' backpack with some bottles in it always works too."
1,Commercial music to make money not art!,"What can you say about a band that has to make a greatest hits album with filler music. They could not even write enough decent songs to make a greatist hits CD! This band will be remembered for bad music like Styx, Little River Band, Queen, REO SpeedWagon,Kansas and etc. Why don't you people try to experiment and listen to music that is not pumped out to you by Top 40 radio!"
5,great CD if you're a Journey fan,The CD is great and the service was exceptionally good. I received the shipment earlier than expected.
5,Greatest Album,"It's the best of Journey, one of the best bands in the history of music, what's not to like?"
5,Journey rules,"I think that Journey is one of the greatest classic rock bands ever. Well, here is the album to show it. This is a collection of their greatest hits and it is really good."
4,an interesting journey...,"I picked this album up to listen to some old favorites from time to time. I grew up with this music on the radio, and ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Faithfully"", ""Any Way You Want It"", ""Separate Ways"", and ""Open Arms"" are thereby a part of my blood...whether or not I want that. I'm a sentimentalist, I guess."
2,"Not my thing, basically, BUT.....","....I hate to admit it, I've heard DON'T STOP BELIEVING enough times on the radio, in the supermarket, on the freaking SOPRANOS, that, yeah, I will concede it's pretty good. And if even the lamest band in the world can have one decent song for which they are fondly remembered, what's so bad about that? Spare me the rants about how this music presaged the downfall of Western society: Madonna, Britney Spears and Axl Rose managed to do THAT far more effectively.The worst you can say about this group and their ""hits"" is that it's all pretty generic, but even a generic band can have a home run."
1,"The ""Best"" songs of the Worst Band ever . . .","Journey has to rate as one of the worst, most persistantly bad bands in American music history. Collecting their hits in one place saves you the pain of sitting through the filler that padded out their albums, but the hits themselves are so unlistenable that I'm not sure this is a good thing. Thank God they're gone! (They are gone, aren't they?)"
4,Good CD to have around.,"Journey has been around for a while, and with good reason! They write great songs. When you have good musicians working together, that's what you get. Great CD or tape to have in the car while traveling or just cruising in a hot car!"
3,Best of Journey?,"I didn't actually listen to this CD but I have the original albums containing most of the tracks. I mostly posted this because I was completely astonished that many people referred to Infinity as their ""debut"" album and to Steve Perry as the ""original"" vocalist.Journey released three very good albums before Infinity and before Steve Perry: Journey, Look Into the Future, and Next. The mid-period albums also had Ansely Dunbar (later of Jefferson Starship) on drums, who is very different than their later drummer (Steve Smith?) I'd especially recommend either their debut (Journey) or the last non-Perry album (Next) to people not familiar with this earlier stuff.Oh yeah, and I agree, ""Stone In Love"" should have been included."
4,"There's no ""Escape"".","This band, or actually this cd, seems to be in everyones collection. Be you a fan of classic rock, pop, metal, soul, or 80's rock, you can't not like these guys. I think even people who say they don't, secretly do. This must sell close to what that ""Eagles"" hits disc has. Anyway, well crafted songs, great melodies, guitar, and of course ""Steve Perry's"" singing, what a combo. All of these are huge hits, but my favorites are ""Faithfully"", ""Lights"", ""Girl Can't Help It"", and ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'"". Overall a classic hits disc for almost anyone. The only thing it makes me miss is ""Perry's"" solo song ""Oh Sherrie""."
1,Unable to play since purchased,Since this was purchased have been unable to. Play it anywhere. Will not transfer to iTunes or any player. If could rate this zero stars I would
5,Fricking Fantastic!,"Earlier in the year we took in a half-grown dumped kitten. Since we've had him his litter box usage had been haphazard and progressively getting worse. It went from peeing on the linoleum in front of the kitchen door to peeing in whatever he felt like. Eventually he started pooping in front of the foyer door and in the bath tub.After vet visits, odor neutralizers, tin foil, adding extra litter boxes, adding extra large litter boxes, and small room isolation we were at our wits end.Finally, our insane neighbor lady told us about this cat litter and after one of her long diatribes about how fantastic the litter is and how Jesus is a space alien, we decided to try it.Within two days the problem beast was regularly using the box and no longer avoiding. This stuff works like a charm."
4,"Carefully organized, comes with answer key",It's nice to have a book that comes with an answer key for a change. Too many of these come with questions but no way to determine if you got it right. This one could use a pronunciation guide but other than that it's pretty good.
5,Best early Video card ever,Bought 2 of these for an sli setup. Did not know how good these cards were until I went to upgrade. Took these 6800xt 128mb out and replaced with 8400 gs 512mb what a mistake. Put the 6800 xt's back in and threw away the 8400gs
2,file holder,A little disappointed...came bent and had to bend into shape and did not get it so it would stand up
5,This is a great book,"Robert and Barbara Thompson have written several books about PC. This book continues their tradition of writing great books about PCs. They write clear concise text that describes what you need to do upgrade or repair an ailing PC. The information is easily understood by a novice, but it also contains valuable information that even an experienced PC upgrader may not know. I especially liked the notes on the page edges from various people that described their hints and tips for PC repair and upgrades."
5,"A perfect, museum quality, body of original artwork","Brilliantly retold for a new generation of children by Laurel Long and Jacqueline K. Ogburn, The Lady & The Lion is an impressive and memorable children's picture book that beautifully illustrates the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the Lady and the Lion. Laurel Long's artwork is a perfect, museum quality, body of original artwork that is a perfect match for the fairytale storyline. To fulfill a desperate promise, a young girl must confront a seemingly terrible lion - yet the beast is actually a prince under an enchantress' spell, and becomes her husband. Yet she must undertake a quest of seven years that will test her courage to its limit to truly rescue him, in this emotional and appealing tale."
2,Marital operatic battles? What was Cain thinking?!?,"'Career in C Major' is a surprisingly weak short novel by James Cain. While it is not poorly written, the book's entire premise is utterly absurd. We have a middle class, middle-aged man in 1930s New York City married to a posh, semi-neurotic wench. The wife believes she has sacrificed a promising career in opera to get married and have children, and now wants to return to opera. Okay, so far so good. But then it turns out that the husband, without any singing background whatsoever, is a naturally gifted and reluctant Caruso who upstages his (very envious) wife! I am surprised such nonsense was dished out by the normally wonderful Cain. No doubt such rubbish was published only because of his reputation.Bottom line: dreadful."
4,Very good and through book,What an excellent guide! Very through. Great maps. The book covers every drainage in Idaho from ice out to ice over.
3,fatal printing errors on a classic,"""the small pig was angry""This was my son's favorite book when he was two: I read this over and over to him. I ordered it for my 2 month old grandson (ok, bit early) but both the first, which I returned, and 2nd copies had the 2nd signature, that is pp 17-32, upside down. This must be a publisher's printing error that permeates the entire run. Be sure to have Amazon check every book before it is shipped to make sure this is corrected.Otherwise it would be five stars. Absolute classic."
1,I got the wrong book,Interchange Student's Book 3 with Audio CD (Interchange Third Edition)I got the wrong book and it wasted my time to wait for this book and then sent it back.
2,Not worth your money,"This CD is garbage. A totally pointless release from an otherwise great band.I think Spoke, their first CD is their best CD, followed by the brilliant Black Light, their second CD. Hot Rail, their third CD, has some really good moments, but has a lot of throw away stuff as well. I also liked them better live as a duo then what they are doing now with a full band. So I guess what I am saying is that their earliest stuff is their best, and it progressively gets, not worse, but lets just say less interesting/more predictable. I haven't by any means given up on them and am keeping my fingers crossed for their new CD, already recorded, that is supposed to come out in the spring of 2003. Also, the stuff that they did on Neko Case's, Black Listed, is amongst the best stuff they've ever done, along with their contributions to Giant Sand's, Chore Of Enchantment. Calexico's vinyl only, Descamino-The Black Light Remixes, is also worth checking out if you can find it. It's brilliant."
5,the sound,"I have this on cassette, I liked it then, and I just had to have it on cd too. I still like it now."
3,Delicate Sound Of Thunder!!!!!!! Pink Floyd!!!!!!!,"I have heard many different comments & ratings from Floyd fans about which live album is better ""Delicate Sound Of Thunder"" or ""Pulse"" - in my humble opinion I have considered both to be very close in comparison... However, I have always leaned more towards ""DSOT"" I think it is slightly better overall... I enjoyed the versions of Floyds classic songs on this album a bit more... Just my opinion..."
1,Delicate sound of blunder,"The plodding, empty performances on this CD serve one purpose and one purpose only: to make more money for David Gimour and company.Don't believe the positive reviews here, because it's not about Gilmour vs. Roger Waters. If you like Pink Floyd, stick with the studio albums. This would be in the cut-out section if the band members hadn't greedily called it ""Pink Floyd"" just to delicately rip you off."
1,"""Could someone direct me toward the REAL music?""","Why would anyone pay real, american, hard-earned currency for this trash? No offense to any of the band members, but don't you think that it would've made more sense to record the BEST version of the music, which would be done in a studio? I can play better Pink Floyd on a kazoo while intoxicated than the dribble that's on this cd. DON'T BUY IT"
5,Good Stuff,I have to agree Pulse is better but this is good too!! Any true Floyd fan will want both!!
5,Delicate Sound of Thunder,This is absolutly the best CD i've ever heard by Pink Floyd.i listen to it all the time
4,"Hey, great concert.","The first time I watched this concert on video I was blown away. The light show was out there!!! Even now many groups would have trouble matching these type of effects. It was Pink Floyd themselves that superceeded it with their PULSE concert.The recording of the music was brilliant. Songs like ""Sorrow"" and ""On The Turning Away"" were very cool.Dave Gilmour's guitar playing was fantastic. His beautiful hanging sustained cords. Brought tears to my eyes.Basically until PULSE the best ever live show that I have ever seen."
3,Not so power rangers.,Hey! All you power ranger fans. Here is a review for this video finally. Even if you love the power rangers this video isn't for you. This video is for young kids and their parents who like listening to christmas carols. There isn't any of the good power ranger action were all use to with the cool music and monsters. But since it is a power ranger video and is hard to find I give it 3 out of 5. You still get to see all the classic charcters. Hope this helps you in your quest to save the world from the evil Rita Repulsa.
5,Amazing live performance,I have had this since it was first released. Donna is a phenomenal live performer. She doesn't miss a beat.
4,"Good FAX, too little ink","I've been using this fax machine for three months. It performs well, but the black cartridge holds too little ink."
5,Newberry Medal award candidate,"A new author and a great beginning. The main characters, a cat that talks to an owl, are as full and intriguing as Wilbur, a pig who talks to his friend Charlotte, a spider. The author wraps the tough decisions and heavy toils exacted by life into an engrossing tale of a cat with a twist - a cat that can see the future. Like all good books, the message winds its way through the book as the cat's journey takes it from one missed opportunity to another and as the 'good' decisions directly affects others and indirectly builds a charcter adults can appreciate as well as children. A good book to give yourself and to pass along to others."
2,A rehash of standard AA philosophy,"Rather than discuss all of these issues again in a review, the title says it all. This book reinforces the philosophy that willpower is not enough to overcome addiction (standard AA higher power and surrender philosophy). However, that is simply not true. There is amble evidence to the contrary and other books make this clear (see 7 Tools to Beat Addiction). Most of this book is standard AA philosophy and offers nothing new to someone seeking to overcome an addiction. It is fair to say that this book is well written and is less preachy than others; and it may be just what some people need. If willpower gets you to an AA meeting, then maybe willpower can do more. You can and do have the strength to overcome addiction, and it does require willpower."
1,Not A Durable Winder,"I bought 2 double auto watch winders from Amazon. I've got no complaints about its functions, basically it works well to keep automatic watches wound. But be warned, product durability is poor. Both my winders ""died"" within 6 mths of usage."
2,watch winder,"first one didnt work company sent me new one, it works sporadically. but it works doesnt follow the prescribed timing settings for winder operation, but it is cheapest winder on the market so ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Arrived broken twice,"These are nice-looking, heavy duty dessert glasses that remind me of a soda counter. I'd buy them if I saw them in a store. But they arrived broken in the box. I returned them and the replacements also arrived broken in the box. Poorly packaged--don't waste your time."
3,The Mystery at Devil's Paw(Hardy Boys no. 38),This book may not be the best in the series but like most books in the series it has plenty of excitement and cliffhangers to keep the attention of the reader. The writer takes advantage Alaska and Canada as a backdrop very well as it affects the story to the point of being another character in the story. I have never understood why the Hardy Boys have been pidgeon holed as only being for boys 8-12. I honestly think the stories could be interesting to readers of all ages and would recommend them to all readers interested in mystery and suspence.
2,Excuse me while I slit my wrists,"Although this is not without it's good points (most notably Tonight, Tonight), I got really tired of hearing the mid-30 year old Billy Corgan whine about about how bad his teen angst is. Someone tell Billy-Boy to pull the gun away from his head and smile a bald smile every once in a while. If I want to be depressed, I'll just watch the news. Decent musicians, tiresome pissing and whining"
3,sad music,"this is sad music, it makes me sad. this is sadder than sad. the vocals are great but the melodies could be better!"
5,One of the greats,"When i first heard this album in my early 20's i knew it was something special. Having picked up an old pre-loved copy in the bargain bin of a second hand record store I wasn't expecting much really. For me it's quite simply a roller coaster ride of emotions, evrything from heavy rock to pop metal coupled with poetic lyrics. Some 10 years later I still can't get enough of this album. Aural bliss!"
4,A tad pretenious,"This third album from the smashing pumpkins was one of the first cd's i ever owned. Obviously i loved it then, but since 95 i have put it away, and only every know and then i come back to it. Whenever i do i am amazed at how much of an accomplishment it really is. Being that the pumpkins didnt put out anything after worth any merit, and this album is far superior to anything they released before it, this is the essential smashing pumpkins cd. its a shame things fell apart with jimmy chamberlin right after this cd, because his percussion is superb, particularly on the soft and epic songs. all in all this is a great cd, with many of the best tracks never recieving any air play. too bad they out played the radio cuts too, because they are also strong songs"
5,The second best double cd out,"Of course, it isd second to the Fragile, but it's not far off. It has all the hits and a lot of other great songs. The first disk, Dawn to Dusk includes Tonight, tonight, Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, and many other great songs. Although sometimes the lyrics or song title don't seem to make sense (Like Porcelina of the Vast Oceans?), still it is an incredibly written and performed album, definitely my favorite of the Smashing Pumpkins."
4,Still holds up,"I hadn't listened to this in a while, actually, and was going over my list of stuff I owned on Amazon. Still a really good CD to leave on and listen to in the background. Pretty amazing after this time, especially since the ""alternative"" label has changed so much since then."
1,Billy did your ego get you?,Siamese Dream was one of the best albums ever made. What happened? Billy Corgan's head swelled is what happened. When this happened he decided his music could be awful. There are some songs I enjoy such as Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings but I cannot sit through this album! Even to this day I have not been able to listen to this all at once. Even the Zero EP had better b-sides than this. All I can say is brilliance flew out the window when Butch Vig left.
1,Overrated,"My rating of this album is summed up by the title of the fourth track - ""Zero"". Billy Corgan has to be the most overrated musician of the decade."
2,"Wonderful packaging, awful sound quality","I took a risk and bought this item even after hearing from dissatisfied customers on the web. I was happy to find that the packaging for this re-issue is absolutely top notch. You get two nice quality, thick booklets along with the four LPs. Unfortunately, my A/B disc suffers the exact same problem everyone else is complaining about. There is distortion which is tolerable up until the half way through the song Zero. At that point, I'm compelled to shut it off. Total shame. I'll hold on to this for the packaging and the hope that the first disc might get replaced. Hoping I'll be able to adjust this up to a five star some time in the future with an update."
5,An Essential Epic,"Anyone who gives this album fewer than four stars hasn't let these tunes seep in. This music is gorgeous, diverse, intense, and heartfelt. It's got everything from scorching metal to sweet, romantic ballads to poignant laments. There's a lot more to this Sadness than the blatant bitterness of Zero; Mellon Collie is about a range of human feeling beyond depression. There's always somebody writing the Pumpkins off, but that's because Billy Corgan knows how to take risks and let his full talent show. Don't let them fool you. This album will crown your collection of 90's rock."
4,good CD but not pumpkins best,"compared to the other CDs made by the pumpkins this is not quite enough. the singles are good, but when buying the CD after having listened to them, it can be quite a disappointment. the songs mostly sound the same and the instrumental part is poor. an electronic sound which doesn't really do. (adore shapes it up til it's perfect.) too many songs. still, this is good music and songs like stumbleine, x.y.u and an ode to no one keeps up with the singles and certainly makes mellon collie worth buying."
4,Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. Amazing,"This CD has alot of filler in it but songs like Bullet With Butterfly Wings, 1979, Zero, and We Only Come Out At Night are so amazing they almost make up for the other 24 songs. Not that I don't have nice things to say about those songs. The lyrics are the best I've ever heard and they show you what an amazing poet Billy is. I really can't describe how compelling and thought provoking the lyrics are. The Pumpkins, particularly Billy's, talent will definatly go unsurpassed and I truly wish I could have given this album 5 stars."
5,Heaven...I'm In Heaven...,"This deluxe edition was worth every penny! I am so happy! This was already my all-time favorite album by any artist, and now that I've had a chance to see what the deluxe edition has to offer, I am fully satisfied!"
5,"""Speak to me in a language I can hear...""","Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the Smashing Pumpkins most complicated and prettiest album. This epic contains two discs so expect a lot of different styles of music, you get a little bit of everything, beautiful ballads with haunting melodies, the alternative rock anthems, and Corgan's quirky unique songs. How can you go wrong with songs like: Thirty-three, Tonight, Tonight, 1979, Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Lily (My One and Only Love), Where Boys Fear to Tread and etc. Important album of the '90s, buy this masterpiece today!"
2,Disappointed! could have been great,"First and foremost, this is a five star album. This is a review of the newly remastered vinyl edition specifically. As mentioned by others, Zero sounds horrible, incredibly distorted. The rest of it sounds pretty good, but I'm returning it, for the price I'm not willing to accept this, the entire album should be perfect. It's a shame, the artwork and packaging are top notch, too bad that quality wasn't applied to what matters most, the sound quality of the music."
5,"simply fantastic, absolutely amazing",This is a wonderful album. A beautiful assortment of songs. A great gift to anyone.
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited when I got this album for Christmas, but when I went to listen to it some of the songs skipped over half the words in the song! I'm returning it in the hope that I will get one that does not skip so much!"
2,Took 6 weeks,This order took 6 weeks to get here. I made several calls to find out where the item was and was informed it would almost take 2 months to arrive.
1,End half scratched,"End half scratched. I can't even listen to half of the CD, very disappointed. Probably will not listen to it at all."
1,Thumbs down for coleman,"I'm dissapointed in this product from coleman. Normally the stuff they put out is of better quality. I know the thing only cost ten bucks, but it's junk. The first time I used it the ""positive fit lock collar"" bent and came loose from the tightening ring. The shovel blade when ""locked"" is bent backwards slightly making digging a pain. I just saw a comparable version today at a tool tent in a parking lot for $8 that was better constructed. I would send it back if the shipping wouldn't cost so much."
2,Great as long as you never put any backwards pressure on it...,"I bought 2 of these for a Boy Scout winter camp trip and within a few minutes of using each they were useless. We were trying to dig out snow caves with them and any time you would pull down on the shovel it would pop loose and fold up. After a couple times of doing this it wouldn't even hold anymore. I would think if it was used carefully for digging holes only it would probably work fine. In conclusion, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the lock collar but for $10 it will do what it is suppose to do, just don't expect it to do any more..."
2,Not good. Sleeves too short!,"I would not recommend this shirt. I thought I was buying the same shirts that i have that i love, well got these in the mail, tried it on and was NOT happy. Something must be wrong with the stitching bc when i tried it on and lifted my arms the shirt came WAY up."
2,Save your money,"This tent has no floor. Photos and other reviews state otherwise. The bugs love to be in it. Lizards too. I suppose with some citronela candles or a bug zapper would help. Barely room inside for a regular picnic table with benches. Would be a very tight fit. It did assembloe very easily though, in about 10-15 minutes all by myself. I would not recommend this product."
3,Not what expected,"This book is mostly examples of legal forms, software would be a much better investment. There is some (very little) information and advice on the subjects but not as much as I was hoping for."
1,Not enough information.,"I ordered this book along with several other books on Italian hotels and tourism. Of those ordered, I found this to be the least informative. The book lists hotels, but doesn't provide detail information. I was looking more for descriptions of the furnishings and personal recommendations"
2,Do they still make these?,"I purchased this TV as a replacement for a RCA 24"" TV. The price was right and I have purchased Sylvania TVs in the past. What I did not realize was that this TV should be outdated. First I noticed that the TV is mono sound. It is not stereo sound. Do they even make TVs without stereo sound anymore? Apparently they do. But it got worse. This model only has RCA plugs in the front. It has none in the back. The only plug in the back is the basic cable plug. I guess this is what I get for making assumptions. If you are looking for a television with absolutely no thrills, buy this one. Otherwise, spend an extra $30 to get stereo and plugs in the back.The picture is about what you would expect from a low end model. The sound from the one speaker is okay. You can do better for a little extra dough."
3,Excellent Book Written While 3rd Rock Was at its Best,"This is an excellent report by Dick Solomon to the Big giant Head on the oddities and behaviours that we inferior humans partake in our day to day lives. Written after the first year of the show, this book still has the naivety of Aliens discovering many human traits, customs, and social interactions for the first time which disappeared after a few seasons of the show. If you loved the show at its peak then this is the book for you."
2,Don't be misled,"I found this boith annoying and aggrivating, where that, although it does come with a CD to help, it actually does not contain the neccessary software to creat it such as 3Ds Max and Character Studio. So just make sure you have them before you buy it."
4,He is just getting better all the time,"This is a very good album. My wife usually does not care for my choices (she is a bubble gum 1960's music listener). But this one made her flip. With this album I may be on the way to converting her! Now that is a feat I can't do, but Marion can!"
2,there are four hole in it....so upset,"I was so upset when I finally got this home. Four holes, not sure why, there are no dividers so the product does not allow for separated recycling. I really found it to be no more than a wax coated cardboard box. Very disappointed."
4,Happy in my jacket!,"This jacket is exactly as the photographs depict. It's hip length, moderately warm, and well-finished. The shorter length is great if you get in and out of the car often as I do in my line of work. However, it will not be as warm as calf-length down parka. It's great for moderate climates and wear before the depths of winter set in if you live in a colder climate.The only disappointing thing I can report about this jacket is that the buttons on it were loose on arrival. I had to take it straight to a seamstress to have them reinforced with a sewing machine, which I don't have (nor know how to operate!). They are an unusual shape so I wouldn't want to lose one and have to replace them all!"
4,Follow your Dream,"Here we have a description of how Robert Asp had a dream to build a Viking replica ship near Moorhead, MN, then transport it and sail it to Norway from Duluth, Minnesota. His wife Rose describes with a loving eye how Robert studied the project, overcame many obstacles, and stimulated family, friends, neighbors and acquaintances to share his dream.The biggest obstacle for Robert turned out to be a life threatening disease. In between treatments, and despite the ravages of the illness, he got the ship built. He passed away before the voyage could be completed. His family picked up the baton, completing the dream with many helpers, including some Norwegians.In a nutshell, in a short book with beautiful pictures, the reader can be inspired, learn how to inspire others, how to meet adversity and win a legacy. Oh, and the insights into how Viking ships were constructed and life in one on the open ocean were enlightening."
4,"Very bland and hard to get through, but concise","It's a very hard book to get through, but I'm not sure there is any way to make a public policy book better. It appears to cover everything at least on a basic introduction to public policy level."
1,Something of interest to Pat Robertson fans,"Everyone knows what a peaceful, tolerant, honest, moral, non-hypocritical bastion of Christian love Pat Robertson is, but few people are aware of his excellent signing voice, especially in his renditions of ""pop culture"" hits. Using any peer to peer file sharing network program, you can download a plethora of his covers of such notable hits as ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"", ""Master of Puppets"", ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"", and Marilyn Manson's ""The Beautiful People"", though if you can find it, I particularly reccomend finding Robertson's soulful rendition of Hasselhoff's ""Hot Shot City"", it is particularly good."
1,what a rip off....,Outrageous that sellers have the audacity to charge 40 cents for a secondhand copy of this book. If ever I read a 1 cent book - this is it. Or maybe Robertson should pay me...
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,You have got to be kidding me! Talk about a quick way to make a buck. This book is braindead material as is the laughable television show. Are Americans really this stupid that they will put up with this nonsense? I think not. . . this book and the people on the television version ( including the creators) all belong in third grade.
4,good read but not solid,"The problem with Super Massage Simple Techniques for Instant Relaxation is that it mentions sex just as much -if not more- than the actual massages that *should* be the main focus of the book. I mean there's already hundreds and thousands of sex books out there- I was more interested in the massage and relaxtion information which was mentioned enough, but nothing really plentiful or mind-blowingly original that I haven't already heard or figured out on my own. I dunno, it's not a bad read but you can probably find other books that focus entirely on the topic of massages."
3,"Coffeetable book ""lite""","The value of this little book is in its photos, which are fun to look at. It offers a very light look at each show profiled, with just a little information. It's a book for fun, not a reference book. The information is arranged chronologically, though the layout and design can be confusing if you're searching through it for a particular program."
5,Great Book!,I think this book has great advice for parents who want to instill God's word in their children's life.
5,Best V-Smile Cartridge Available for 3-5 yr. Olds,"My son got the V-Smile Game unit for Christmas from his Grandparents along with the first three games that were available (Care Bears, Pooh, & Lion King). He was able to do very few things with the games because nearly everything involved knowledge of how to use a joy stick and jumping to catch or avoid things - similar to a Mario Bros. game. Throughout my experiences as a Preschool Teacher, I have never seen a three year old that could preform such tasks. We just bought him the Elmo cartridge and it's perfect for his age group!! It actually shows him how to use the joystick through Elmo's verbal reminders and the arrows on the screen. He also really likes the games that Elmo has to play with him. We were so glad that there was finally a game he could play on his own. He's hated having Mom & Dad have to help him with the others. this should be one of the first cartridges you purchase if you're giving the game unit to a three year old."
3,I think there are better complimations,"Bob Marley is one of my favorite artists, but I was disapointed with this CD. Buffalo Soldier and Stir it Up were edit versions. A lot of songs, especially I Shot the Sheriff, faded out too early compared to other recordings I've heard. This complimation may include more songs than others, but I think it's at a comprimise of the way they're presented."
2,Bob Marley : The Baldhead Years,"This one's fine, if it's going to sit right next to your Phil Collins or Dire Straits LPs...but wait, where are Peter and Bunny? Check the real Locks Lion weeping and wailing on the Complete Bob Marley & The Wailers series. ITES!"
5,AMAZING COLLECTION GREAT PICTURES,An amazing and wonderful image collection of the greatest architectural master pieces from around the world.I can only hope to be able to visit a fraction of these places in my own time. Great to be able to see them here!A must for anyone interested in great architecture and photographs.
5,The Grand Tour : Travelling the World with an Architect's eye,The book arrived within 10 days from overseas which was much less than suggested. The conditition of the book which allegedly had 'scuff marks on the cover' was genuinely as new and I am very happy with the purchase.
3,"Good phone system, with some caveats...","The Good: adding a handset is easy, and works as advertised. Sound quality is generally good, and phone has a nice ""feel.""The Bad: Range is poor. Base station is inside second floor apartment. Handset will not even reach to back yard without breakup. Apparently the phone frequency is 5.8 Ghz from the base to the handset, and a 2.4Ghz connection from the handset to the base. I can verify that it is affected by microwave ovens, and they run at 2.4Ghz.The Ugly: Blinking blue led ""Msg. Waiting"" indicator is terribly bright and very annoying. Wish there was a way to turn it off without a screwdriver."
3,service at amazon stinks,buy this product in a store..i ordered from amazon and it took 2 weeks to deliver it....it was in stock too. if you have a problem you cant even talk to a person and no one writes back. service stinks
2,Number Keys don't work,"I bought this about a year ago. I have the main unit (no digital voicemail) and an extra handset. The handsets have great features including individual speaker-phones. The battery life is pretty bad though.The range is bad as well. The main problem however is the number keys on the phone. Handset 1 the 7 button doesn't work unless you press it EXTREMELY HARD. On Handset 2, it is the 0 button.I had a Sony 900 mhz before this one, and had it for 8-10 years. I don't see myself getting anymore handsets for this one."
4,good good,This was a very good movie. The acting was very good and the story was very moving. Made me sad.
1,I never received the product,I never received the product. It went to the wrong place and he didn't resend it to me. So I don't have it
5,Excellent,Excellent collection of songs! Have always loved the Everly Brothers so it was pretty easy to make me happy with this.
5,What Did I DO THIS?,"The Everly Brothers was Wild in 1954. They Broke Up in 1973 in 19 years. Terry And Dana Stop at 67-year-old Dino Died in His Heart Attack on the Backseat in the van on Aug. 8, 1991. Dana was Crying and get a Record Like ""Wake Up Little Susie"" Terry Told Dana Stop at Her Room in '91. Dana Look at the Newspaper and Said ""Dino Lawrence was Dead"" and ""The Everly's Second MCA no. 1 hit. ""Diane"""" Their Hits ""Maybe Tomorrow"" ""All I Have to Do is Dream"" ""Claudette"" ""Bird Dog"" ""Devoted To You"" ""Bye Bye Love"" ""I Wonder if i Care As Much"" ""This Little Girl Of Mine"" ""Should We Tell Him"" ""Problems"" ""Love of My Life"" ""(Til) I Kissed You"" and Oh What a Feeling."""
5,Minolta Z1,I had a Minolta Z1 for 7 years and purchased a second one because I liked everything about the first one. I use them heavily and am thrilled with the quality of the pictures I get.
3,Jazz - Disco fusion album,"Players Association is a band of seasoned jazz players and upbeat disco musicians who were lured by the tidal streams of disco music. So, in an attempt not be left out of the show, they came up with a rich blend of syncopated sounds set in the fashionable disco beat drumming of the time and thus contributed to the empowerment of the music which reigned in the late seventies and throughout the eighties outranking all other sorts of music -even rock. 'Turn the music up' is really to be listened to at a very loud volume as you swirl across the dance floor."
3,Careful on this one,"Superstar has specific graphic requirements and it slows down the graphic speed making the pictures really choppy. It suggests that you turn off your anti-virus software and any other software, but being an ex-tech, I know that is not a great solution. The rest of the sections are wonderful and a lot of fun!"
2,not satisfied.,"When book arrived the front cover was bent , rest of book was fine. I shouldnt have had to pay new price for a damaged book."
5,"This is one of those shows that you know you are going to go to Hell for laughing at it, but you laugh anyway!","My husband got me hooked on this show. We love to sit and laugh at the antics. The fact that the actors are the writers and alot of the material is improv just makes this so much funnier! To be on a set with these actors would be hysterical. I don't know how they do it. Just make sure your children are nowhere near the TV room when this is on!!!! Better yet, make sure that they are not in the house."
5,Most consistently funny show on TV.,"FX has a way with comedy. Archer is great and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has been mostly funny. However, the League is, in my opinion, the most consistently funny show on television. If you haven't followed the show, the fantasy football thing doesn't dominate the show. It just adds to the premise. This season is hands down the funniest. I have watched the Bobbum Man episode at least a dozen times and it's still funny. If you like raunchy, you owe it to yourself to watch The League."
1,Terrible design,"I could spend a significant time ranting about how poor the design is on these. It's very difficult to grasp why a company would put to market such a horrid product. I know for a fact I will never buy these again.The biggest frustration is they fall apart in your closet, as in the basket falls off the rails and the tracks fall off the wall... yes.I would recommend a brand with rollers not this type of track. Rubbermaid makes some for a wee bit more, definitely worth it.Yes these are cheap. But you'll regret the purchase. Even moreso if you make it after having had the opportunity to read my review."
3,Sensual Massage for Couples,"Was less about actual massage then I had hoped. A lot of it was setting the mood and tone for a massage. I guess when its couples that is important. I am more of a techniques guy as I do like to sneak up and use my touch at say the desk, on the couch or the kitchen sink. If your looking for a massage book to help make a relationship more fuller or ""mildly"" erotic I think this book is alright."
4,In Color!,"Got this for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. I paid a little extra for standard shipping, and it still showed up a week late for Christmas, but otherwise very happy."
3,Great to see again,"It was great to see this classic again. These four desert rats torment the Germans in fantastic raids. However, one season was enough. As exciting as it was to see these two jeeps and four men blast through enemy lines and shoot up convoys, it was just too hard to believe that they could get away with it and that poor Dietrich could keep his commission."
4,Good Vitamin D,"I bought these based on a recommendation from my nutritionist. She likes this brand and this dosage. I've been taking them and now I'm big and strong. I don't know, they're vitamins. They arrived quickly and I swallow them with a hope and a prayer..."
5,It's finally available,"Thanks for finally making this available on DVD. I recorded all of the episodes from Ovation TV earlier this year but the quality was poor, so I'll pick this up. This is a very witty and well researched series. The explanation of equal temperament is the best I've ever heard -- and I have a masters in music. I would've grasped the concept much quicker had I seen this presentation."
3,The advantage of only just the bass.,"The sound is enough to listen to the ""simple"" - bum-bum music and nothing more.The two stars for design.Do not pay for them more than 15 dollars - not to be disappointed.(!!!)"
5,So Far So Goood,"As far as the sound and fit they are super. My other set of earbuds are a new set of Bose that are ok but my first choice to plug into my Ipod are my Red Roxx. They stay in my ear better and are very comfortable and the sound is super crisp. The durabilty is yet to be seen, but for right now, by far these are the best value for a mid range priced earbud."
3,Too much like synth pop,"if you are looking for traditional qawwali by the great Abida Parveen, this is NOT the one for you. This intead reminds me of the background music in Indian restaurants: lots of synthesizers and songs with a jolly, bouncy tune, rather than passionate, ecstatic qawwali -- for that latter kind, you need to get her ""Devotional Journey"" album."
1,The same exact thing!,"The best way to describe Until The End's 4th album ""The Blind Leading The Lost"" is to just say ""see previous albums"".You'd think in all this time Until The End they'd have progressed, if not even just a tad bit, but no, it's the same exact UTE album.The riffs are bland and uninspiring, the guitar work is so repetitive, all the songs sound the same and even sound the same as on previous UTE albums. Heck one of them is the same, who's bright idea was it to put yet ANOTHER version of ""Nothing Between Us"" on this CD?The sad part is that some people will actually like this repetitive crap."
2,Duffield and van Cleave fail short,"Although Duffield and van Cleave's work is a due overview of pentecostal theology, it is also rather superficial, if not to say a bit simple.I would recommend the work to anyone who is interested in a clear overall pentecostal theology. However, the book could be improved by a lot. Opinians are given as 'biblical facts' and hardly any accountance is given for the philosophical, theological and cultural demise of Christianity for the last three centuries."
3,Not What I Expected.,"I was very unhappy when I opened the box and saw these earrings. They weren't what I thought I had ordered, isn't 3mm supposed to be small? I've ordered other earrings labeled '3mm' and these were not it.It wasn't worth it to return them; I would pay in shipping and re-stocking fees what I'd originally put into getting them. However, the earrings turned out to be something my mom liked, so it turned out okay."
5,Hot Fiyah,This cd is off the chain! You won't have to skip any tracks on this album! Keep doin' your thing L.I.V.E--I'll be on the lookout for your next cd. Keep them comin'!
3,a hit and miss affair,"Most of the items on this recording are very well done and recorded, but regrettably the CD is let down by Caballe's peformance in the Immolation Scene. I am an admirer of her work as many others are, but find her German is not very idiomatic (one could make the same observations about Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's Italian), and she does not sing the top notes cleanly but scoops them from below instead. In this price range you could do better with the Bohm, Solti, or Karajan - or perhaps Szell best of all - highlights recordings."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"This thin, yet durable hard case fits my RAZR V3c perfectly and tightly. It is very attractive (glossy black), and it is keeping its like-new appearance quite well. I was fearful that it would become covered in scratches quickly -- this hasn't happened. Therefore, I am pleasantly surprised and glad to have come across this protective shell (or skin)."
4,I'll Describe It For You:,"Welcome to Porthole TV -- the magazine television series that features the cruise ship experience and its intriguing ports of call.Porthole TV explores two all time favorite Caribbean destinations, St. Thomas and St. Maarten. The journey starts in the Nassau, Bahamas aboard the MS Westerdam.The busy port of St. Thomas is the Hong Kong of the Caribbean. Americans enjoy duty free shopping for precious gem stones and other booty.Explore one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, Megan's Bay and visit the fantastic Black Beard's Castle.Explore the island of St. Maarten influenced by two nations, Holland and France."
5,These are great,I love these little boxes. They are great for all of my little things on the end tables of the den. They are very nice looking and contain everything well.
2,Dissapointing,"It is small, but in some situations, that's a plus. The negative: it's flimsy, doesn't lock well, and the handle unscrews while using it. I'll throw it in the trunk for emergencies and hope I never have to use it."
1,Trite and pretentious.,"Jim LeCuyer's writing lacks versimilitude. He attempts to convey a sense of depth to his poetry, rather than write from his heart. The result is a series of poems that serve better as examples of decorated shallowness, or simply pretense.Specifically in his writing, LeCuyer abondons the use of proper grammar. While this is perfectlly acceptable for poetry, he makes no clear distinction that it is done for poetic effect.LeCuyer's excessive deluges into the pervesely erotic serve no purpose to the enhancement of the poem, but simply as shock value.Basically, LeCuyer's work lacks one true thing: honesty."
1,Profoundly disturbing,"This is one of the strangest poetry collections I have ever come across. It was completely devoid of form, meaning and taste. LeCuyer has strange views about sex that show up as perversity, curiosity, stunted sexual growth, and just plain wierdness. I would recommend this book to a pschology student, but I don't know if they could make anything of it...."
3,Electronic Enthusiast,"Although I was glad it arrived earlier than anticipated, I was let down to find out it was refurbished, rather than a brand new cartridge. It works in the printer so far, but the gauge indicating the amount of ink remaining does not work with this cartridge."
1,misadvertisement,"Description specifies it to be a Greek oregano, but I received the Mexican oregano. They're two very distinctive herbs, with a very different taste. If I wanted the Mexican variety, I would've gone to the local market. Now I'm stuck with a 12 packs of an herb I barely use. Very disappointing."
3,"Great anime, weak CD","While the others sing the praises of this anime, and they are well deserved, I feel the need to speak out on the CD. For an extra $10 you get a sountrack CD. Normally this is a good value, but not in this case. The CD is 4 tracks. The first is the long version of the opening theme, the 2nd is another different piece, and the other 2 are short versions of the first track that are virtually indistinguishable from each other. Basically, you will be paying $10 more for 2 tracks of music. Not a good deal at all. Save yourself some money and just get the regular edition."
4,"Great book, but English text comes as addendum at the end","We bought this book as a gift to an English-only speaker, but to our regret, we are returning it, because the English part of the book comes as an addendum at the end of the book. It would be great if it is published with Spanish and English side by side."
3,Who is educating whom?,"The play ""Educating Rita"" is quite a good one. It's interesting to follow Rita's change and her new experiences educated by Frank.At the beginning Rita doubt herself and is absolutely not satisfied with her life. Till she meets Frank.She becomes more and more independent and self-confident. And so she finally leaves her husband and starts her life new. At the end she also leaves Frank because she doesn't need him any longer. Frank is lonely now; he has lost a good friend and his job too, because of his alcool- problem.She has changed her life, but she isn't happier with her new life, because she can't go back and she doesn't arrive to manage her new life.( two Swiss students"
4,Holds Up!,I purchased this item in 2005 and really did not expect it to last long. For under $20 I figured 2 years tops. I have had it for 6 years and it still looks and works well. The only complaint I have is about the plastic pieces meant to protect your sink. They got yucky after just a few months so I had to do something else.
2,"Not... I repeat, NOT as pictured!","I wanted another ""over the sink"" type of dish drainer like this. I actually preferred my old one, which was much heaver/sturdier, and coated with white plastic/rubber(?), but... can no longer find. The coating did eventually crack and then rust, but I had it for quite a long time.This one came, not with squared off extensions, but curved ones, which meant that very little of it was securely resting on the counter, which made it way too flimsy and unstable. Even the little utensil holder was curved, which reduced it's size even further.So... I sent it back. I ended up buying a standard Rubbermaid white twin sink wire drainer locally. Sure it won't last, but at least it ""disappears"" into my old white sink and a replacement won't cost much.Nothing seems to be made well anymore!"
2,Double Act,The author of this book is Jacueline wilson.This book is about two twins named Ruby and Garnet that have probloms in there life. Some probloms they fix and some they dont.There dad also has a new girlfriend named Rose and she brings even more afliction into the family.What i liked about the book was that the story was told by the twins. I think that if the story was told by the authors point of view it would be very tiresome. I think it was great that both of the twins got to write in the book because its fastidious to know somthing from two point of view.I would rate this book a little under ok because it wasnt such an exciting book.I think this book should be for 5th graders cause its boring for older people.
4,double act by ashley and leanne,"The book we recently read and enjoyed was Double Act by Jaqueline wilson which we read with our class, 1m2. It is about two identical twins called Ruby and Garnet who live with there dad and gran because there mother died when they were young. Although they look the same they have two totally different personalities. Ruby is the loud and scruffy one and Garnet is the quiet and tidy one. Ruby wants to be an actress when she grows up so when Ruby sees an ad in the newspaper she jumps at the chance to go to it so she bullies Garnet into going with her. There is much heasitation but eventually Garnet gives in. We're not going to tell you any more so you better get reading!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I found this a rather disappointing book. The author is clearly deeply interested in Hemingway, and it is more a book about Hemingway than a book about either Cuba or sailing. Sailing is limited to a trip down the ICW, a crossing to Havana, then Havana back to Florida. No gunkholing or exploring of Cuba by boat. Exploration of Cuba is limited to Havana and Hemingway's farm.I was hoping for a more in-depth exploration of Cuba as a whole, and more sailing than just to Marina Hemingway and back.There is useful information sprinkled here and there about politics, potential trade goods, and social life, but mostly this is a book about Hemingway's life."
3,"Good price, works well, problem with parts","This is a nice little cart, especially at about half the price of its competitors. It is NOT easy to put together, though. As another reviewer mentioned, the little plastic pieces appear to be easy to break. They are NOT easy to use. (They are what hold the wire bottom and sides together.) The first time I ordered this, they were also missing. (Thanks, Amazon, for such a speedy replacement/return process!) I would have liked this a lot better if the mechanism holding the pieces together were more substantial and easier to install. (I would even have been willing to pay $5-10 more for it.)"
5,"Fun, Educational Read!","This is the best book on Japanese Folklore I've found!It has a great intro with lots of info about the culture behind the tales. The translation is excellent and flows naturally like storytelling should! It includes hundreds of tales and they're just the right length. Fun to read, but short enough to get through quickly. All of the tales included are from Medieval times so it doesn't reference Kappa at all (they're newer additions to Japanese lore). A great book for fun, and for better understanding Japanese tradition and culture!"
3,Good enough,"Purchased these binoculars about 18 months ago. These binos work well enough for my purpose. That is watching birds in the bird bath and on the feeders in the back yard. They focus very clearly and the view is fairly bright. But, the rubber eye cups disintegrated after only 6 months. I just peeled them off and use them without the eye cups."
2,Typical James Horne serial of the forties,"Many of the Columbia serials of the forties were'nt a whole lot better than the Universals but the 1940-41 Columbia serials had one advantage: they were done with tongue-in-cheek by former Laurel and Hardy director James Horne. In this serial, for example you will see such things as gangsters hanging out their laundry to dry and engage in knockabout fights that are so outrageously phoney as to evince a smile. Jack Holt as our hero reminds one of Fearless Fosdick and engages in tough guy dialogue with, most clearly, his tongue in his cheek. Serial puristS probably hate the serials of James Horne, understandably. Horne must have figured with his limited budget and resources that his approach might not have made better serials but at least they would be different."
4,"Joseph ""Robb"" Roberts","The whole idea of a serial or movie for that matter is to get you watching from start to ending. This Serial does that, mostly on the sholders of its star Jack Holt. Could the plot be better? yes. Could the lines be written better? maybe. But WOW! does this serial take off with action in the Saturday movie sreial mode. At one time, Jack Holt was one of the highest paid actors of the silent screen era, and why he was shows through here. When he is on screen, you watch. Also a true fact, The writer of a famous movie detective liked Jack Holt's acting so much he patterned his detective after Jack Holt. The writer's detective was none other than Dick Tracy. Yes this serial is worth getting, also it was the only serial that Jack Holt made."
1,Advertised product not available,Very disappointing that items are advertised and then not available. I will be hestitant to bother with items advertised through this site in the future. Bait and switch.
4,Very good read,Any business that is open-minded and willing to build an entrepreneurial culture would do well by reading this book. Command-and-control leaders might want to re-read 'Art of War' and skip this one. It's not for them.This book is a refreshing view on how operating a business can be simplified and still be successful.Way to go Blues Clues!
4,Love Naruto,"My son plays with his Naruto action figures all day, he is a huge fan of Naruto. this toy is good, durable enough for an action figure."
3,A sad farewell,"White's earlier books in the trilogy showed his at first hesitant, then total submersion into the gay world. In reading this book, it seemed as if everyone White knew died of AIDS, and he spent years as HIV positive while writing it. That gave this reader the same feeling he gained in reading Reinaldo Arenas' ""Before Night Falls:"" One felt he was sharing White's last months and wondered if he was going to live to finish it. That gave added pathos to the book, which also exhibited White's best, most linear, least obscure writing toward the end than that found in other books in the trilogy. Again, it was so heavily into the gay world that gay readers could perhaps identify with it more easily than most other readers."
4,An excellent evolution storyabout the gay mind and society,"I hope people fallow White's thoughts about the gay world, I like him because he can explain the reality and the real in gay mind."
3,how to Live in the world and still be happy,"I liked this book but not as much as his first book ""Notes to Myself"". It wasn't as inspiring as the first book."
3,"Aurora AS1040C shreds well, but overheats","I wanted a microshredder for disposing of a lot of personal documents following my mother's death. The Aurora AS1040C does an excellent job of microshredding. However,I was disappointed to find that it consistently stops working due to overheating after 10 to 15 minutes of continuous use. Once it overheats it takes awhile to cool off to the point where it will work again. By contrast, I own an inexpensive strip cut shredder that works virtually nonstop for hours. The Aurora AS104C also lacks credit card or CD/DVD shredding capability, but I like being able to roll it easily. If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive microshredder that you don't expect to consistently keep in use for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time, then you'll probably be happy with the Aurora AS104C."
3,"More ""Reality"" TV","This show is still pretty interesting. People still bring in interesting things. I could still really do without the bad language (which is experienced as frequent waves of bleeping""). The family drama still typically comes across as contrived too."
2,Dear Graduate...,"I found the book to be a light read. It feels as though the author was looking to write a book to help young people yet, found it to be more of a process in which to feel better about his own decisions and struggles. I couldn't finish the book."
5,great tape,I never thought I'd be able to meditate and had just about given up when I found this tape. The harp music is soothing and so is Joyce's voice. Now I'm able to drift off and relax in a way I never thought possible.
2,"Good price, cheap film","I purchased one of these at my local dive shop to use on a dive trip. The clear case works well and is durable. I like the large view finder attached to the top and the easy to use controls. The camera is kind of cheap, but does work. First thing anyone should do is change out the film that comes with it. It is the worst! The film is made in Europe some place. Drop in some Kodak, Fuji, Polaroid, etc...Use anything but the junk that comes with it. Throw it out immediately! Only seven of the twenty-seven pictures I took came out and some were dis-colored. This unit is good if you don't want bring your digital camera or don't want to incur the expense of a digital camera for underwater use. I only gave this two stars beacuse of the film. Shop around for the best price. I found mine for $14.00."
2,What the ...???,"I heard a bit of this on the radio and was intrigued. I bought it becasue I'm game for the weird and wonderful, but I have to admit it wears thin and boring quickly. Sorry, I wish I had been delighted."
4,A somewhat unusual but excellent history lesson,"Have recommended it to several in Japan where I read it, and to people in Palau where I vacationed thereafter."
2,slow and nothing new,"I thought that the book moved rather slowly and didn't really provide a whole lot of information or insight. I expected a bit more of why the individual drinks played a role, instead of just the fact that they did."
3,A Superficial History Lesson With Potables,"An entertaining and easily-read book that casually traces the impact of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coke on human history. There are a few new tidbits of information and interesting factoids, but nothing particularly earth-shattering here. If you're looking for intriguing details on the order of ""Salt: A world history"" or ""Potato: How the humble spud changed the world"" you'll be disappointed. That said, this is a good starting point for anyone interested in learning how consumables can impact history. An Amazon reviewer referred to one of the author's other books as a 'McBook' which is probably equally accurate here. But there's certainly room in the world for the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries. It may not be tremendously nutritious or flavourful, but it's tasty enough."
4,Not just for history buffs,"This is a way to be exposed to history through the interresting tale of of beverages. The part that ""spirits"" played in U.S. history had far more of an impact than I realized."
3,Fun but flimsy,"My son got a Skyrocopter for his 5th birthday. It was a really fun toy that got him outside, but the string didn't last long. I think we'd had it for 3 or 4 days before it broke, and I don't feel anyone was particularly rough with it. We opened up the case and decided there was no way to re-string it. My son really loved it though, so since it's pretty cheap I'll be ordering another one and maybe we'll get a full week out of it."
1,A Dud!,"Years ago, my now-ten year old had a great helicopter toy from Discovery Toys -- you pulled a string and the propellor blades would go 20 feet or more in the air. I know have a three year old and the ten year old wanted to create the same experience for her little sister. This is not the one to do it. The blades would go about 5 feet tops and it was a little hard to pull. I will continue to search for the dream flying toy!"
4,Amazing Flute Player,"Pahud is a joy to listen to no matter what he plays. I was unfamiliar with this piece of music, but after reading the very good reviews on Amazon I bought it. It is different than what I have listened to on other Pahud CD's I own, but I am always amazed to hear the skill at which he plays. I am glad I bought this recording and I think that it is one that I will enjoy more as I listen to it over and over."
3,Fragile!!!!,Very nice teapot - but handle with care! I hit the handle with a cup and the handle broke into three pieces. I was merely moving the cup from one place to another and brushed the teapot. It did make excellent tea for a couple of weeks.
2,Not what I was expecting at all!,"Before you pay $30 for this book I would suggest that you check out an actual copy of it first. I figured that I would like it. I like things that are odd and messed up. I don't care what kind of a mind set you're in, some thing just shouldn't be written (or read). I would not recommend this book."
4,Effete Ear Candy,"Their sound is indeed close to Belle and Sebastian, but perhaps even closer to the Monochrome Set, or Jarvis Cocker fronting some 60s bubblegum band. But these folks are sensitive and earnest whereas the Monochrome Set were often just plain silly. The mix of instruments, trumpet and woodwinds, adds a nice touch to the reverby guitar and effete vocals. Well worth checking out."
1,Dissapointing Teakettle,"I received this teakettle as a wedding gift 8 months ago. When I took it out of the box I thought ""oh, perfect, it matches my new stainless steel appliances, but it felt a little too light to really last and my instinct was right. I use a teakettle everyday and this one just didn't hold up. After a couple of months of use the clapper that closes over the pouring hole melted from the steam. I couldn't believe it, a clapper should be able to withstand very high temperatures. And then just last week the piece that you press down to cause the clapper to open literally broke off of the teakettle. Needless to say, it went out to the garbage and I'm back to using my heavy, reliable, handy-dandy teapot that I bought over 10 years ago."
4,What's with the potato?,"The acting is superb, the singing (especially Catherine Naglestad and Susan Graham) fantastic, but what's with the lady riding what looks for all the world like a baked potato...and why does the chorus have masks on at the end? Another fine example of European regietheater, where the director is more concerned with his own ego than with the intentions of the composer."
2,Perhaps I Just Don't Get It,"I'm a recent convert to classical music, and when a glowing article about for Olivier Messiaen appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, I decided to give it a whirl. I feel I'm out the money I paid. The notes seem randomly thrown together, and the ""exotic birds"" sound like no kind of bird I've heard. The clamor of notes is disconcerting and unharmonious, and the audio effects (some kind of wind machine used to simulate canyon breezes comes to mind) seem contrived and only more distracting. Nor am I alone in this position: my girlfriend Sarah, a classical flutist and pianist, agrees that the ""music"" is unmusical and the supposed birds aren't there to be heard. Perhaps she and I just don't get it. And perhaps it's just not there to be gotten."
5,amazing!,This is an awesome old school grind album. The use of clean guitars is what catches me. This is heavy as heck and pretty calming at times. Only way to find out is to give it a try.
2,Too complicated,"This kit is for more experienced ""beaders"". The patterns are not easy to make and there aren't enough jingles. But my kids liked the concept."
2,Weak but interesting,"This is one of those books you feel you HAVE to enjoy . . . because if you don't, someone will say ""You just don't get it.""Honestly, there's nothing to get. Dan Clowes tells a story that almost makes sense. It feels like he made it up as he went along, so each chapter seems disconnected from the last. The end is contrived and plot threads are left dangling.But it's not all bad. He art is tight, complimenting the claustrohic and static story very well. The book makes you think and wonder --- you'll have fun trying to put it all together, even if you fail.And best of all, it might introduce you to the wild and crazy world of grown-up comic books, the kind of comic books that Fantagraphics publishes. If this one doesn't satisfy you, there's always Love & Rockets, Joe Sacco, and Chris Ware."
4,Like A Bullet in the Head......,"His last name may be Boring, but his story sure isn't.....When his ""Friend"" is mysteriously murdered (The wound that killed him apparently looks like a giant thumb-print in his forehead), David's life takes a turn towards the surreal: His dream girl mysteriously disappears, he is shot in the head for (Seemingly...) no reason, and when he is taken to a deserted island to recuperate, World War III seems to break out, complete with germ-warfare.Writer/Illustrator Dan Clowes continues to deliver books that are impossible to encapsulate, yet impossible to put down. I literally had no idea where the story (And characters) would end up, but I couldn't wait to see them arrive. Murder, infidelity, terrorism....It's all a part of the mix, and Clowes does a wonderful job of making all of the pieces fit. If Clowes is capable of producing work that ISN'T groundbreaking, it'd be news to me. Highly recommended!"
2,His worst,"Just because it's in the title doesn't mean i CAN'T say that this was just boring. It really seemed for the first time that Clowes was TRYING to be hip. The characters were nothing to be liked, there was nothing about the main character that made me care what happened next. The ending wasn't really an ending, so much as the story just stopping.Read Pussey!, Ghost World, Velvet Glove Cast in Iron (masterpiece), Caricature, or even Lloyd Llewellyn (for quick laughs). This one... buy it if you think the late 90's were cool."
2,"Poor sound quality, awkward shape","I bought this phone hoping to replace an old panasonic phone that we've had for seven years (which worked great until about four months ago). First, the sound quality isn't very good. There was a constant static in the background that made it hard to hear the person on the other end. Second, the shape stinks. The flat design makes it difficult to hold for extended periods of time. I would not recommend that anyone else buy this phone."
3,"Good audio quality, Poor feature set",The audio quality of this 5.8 GHz phone is good. The speaker phone feature on each handset it very nice. Now the bad news... each device (base unit/handset) can hold 50 numbers in the phonebook. Each entry (name/number) has to be individually entered on each device. There is no synchronization mechanism. Note that there are two separate phonebooks on the base unit and the first handset!! Would have been a great phone if it had that capability.
2,Don't plan to use as a wall phone!,"I don't have this phone for a long time, but I bought it to replace my existing Uniden phone mounted on the wall. This motorola phone comes with a wall bracket, but does not truly fit a standard wall jack. The holes on the bracket do not line up with the screws on a standard telephone wall jack. Furthermore, the design is lackluster at best since the wall bracket makes the phone tilt at a big angle, which makes the display hard to read unless you are 6'5"" tall or your telephone wall jack is four feet from the floor. Bottom line: Phone may be good as a desk phone, but buy something else for the wall."
1,Miserable Performance,"I purchased one of these phones about a year ago - mostly because our old 2.4ghz phone conflicted with our wi-fi network. I was so pleased with it that I purchased 2 more base stations for our office and 3 more handsets for our home.Recently (about a year later) the signal on the handsets started to degrade rapidly. After doing some research, I found that the phone is not a ""true"" 5.8 ghz - but is actually 2.4 ghz for receiving signals. Thus the signal degraded as more wireless networks were added around our home and around our office. The signal is so bad on 2 handsets that they are completely unusable - and it is noticably bad (and getting worse by the day) on the other handsets.Now I have 3 worthless base stations and 3 worthless extended handsets.If you ever think you might use this near a wireless network (wi-fi) then stay away from this phone."
2,Motorola cordless phone,"A pretty disappointing product. Our sole reason for purchasing the phone was the long range promised by 5.8 GHz phones, but the phone has a usable range of perhaps 150 feet. Although it has many nice features, the short range is a disappointment."
3,Surprisingly lack of useful features,"Cons:1. Surprisingly this model lost many features from its predecessor MD481. I first bought the MD481 model but had to return it twice to Motorola and finally gave me this MD681 ""upgraded"" model. (MD481 has some failures with the answering machine system)2. Answering Machine is totally separate from the system.3. Can't check answering mailboxes through handsets.(MD481 can)4. Handset doesn't show that you have new messages in the answering machine (MD481 shows it)5. Handsets and the Base do not share Phonebooks. (MD481 can)6. While listening to messages, CallerID does not show caller's info (again because answering system is a totally separate unit.7. Ring tones are terrible. (MD481 has better choices)Pros:1. Good voice quality2. Has a battery compartment for the base too for power outages.3. Great microphones and speakerphones on handsets and base."
2,Terrible Sound on the Answering Machine,"After owning the answering machine for about 6 months, the playback was garbled and almost impossible to understand. It sounded like the person who was speaking had a mouthfull of mush. I have actually missed some messages because of this. I have had no problems with the other aspects of the machine."
2,"Worked for 11 months after receipt, then broke","When I got it, I was very pleased with this phone. Ok, the receiver hand-feel wasn't as good as the Panasonic ... but the battery life is much better than Panasonic's.Alas, it stopped working just after 1 year from the date of purchase. The receiver stopped communicating w/ the base, so no calls. More pitifully, it was 11 months from the date of receipt, given Amazon.com left it on back order for 1 month in 2004. Which Motorola decided to count against my warranty time ... even thought the phone wasn't in my possession, nor in use.Anyway, the phone is probably ok for the current $20 - $30 price (post-rebate). But I paid $105 in 2004, and I would have liked it work for me more than 11 months."
2,Not impressed,Currently have a Panasonic 2.4 GHz phone and have been very happy with it but want to upgrade to 5.8 GHz so I don't conflict with WiFi and the buttons on the Panaonic are worn out. Was really looking forward to being impressed with the phone but was disappointed for the following reasons:1) phone feels like a brick2) reception was not any better than the 2.4GHz Panasonic3) buttons are hard to push. Several times I dialed a number only to notice that one of the digits did not take.Going to order the 5.8GHz panasonic. Only concern is that it has a built in answering machine which we do not need. Wish Panasonic made a 5.8GHz phone without built in answering machine.
5,Replaced Siemens with these Motorola phones,"I had to replace my Siemens Gigaset phones, because they were terrible with a wireless network in the house. These Motorolas have been flawless (MD681 & MD61). Yes, you have to add numbers into each phone in each of the handset phonebooks, but it is fairly easy to do, especially if the number you are adding has called into you recently. These are solid, well-designed and well-built phones. My small gripe with the phones is that I would like the time to sync all the handsets from the base, and I wish each handset could be named (i.e. 'Upstairs', 'Kitchen', 'Basement'), instead of just numbered ('Handset 1', 'Handset 2', etc.). That is pretty minor, considering the many, many useful features and functions on these phones. I recommend them strongly to buy."
1,Keep Shopping,"I fought with this phone for over a year.Cons:1. Terrible Battery Life2. Terrible Range3. Terrible Clarity4. Answering machine not integrated in any way with the phone. They are technically part of the same unit, but they might as well be separate boxes.Pros:1. When I was within 10 feet of the base, the speakerphone on the handset worked reasonably well.Motorola should be ashamed to put their once proud brand on such a terrible product."
4,Great Intro,"My wife and I used this resource before getting married. It was a great start for setting the foundation for a Godly marriage. Looking back I know it was helpful for several reasons: 1) communication - sharing our needs/learning each others 2) brought up topics we had not discussed that are vital before you say ""I Do"" 3) confirmed that she was the one....we saw how much in common we had and how much our worldviews were equal. It confirmed we were on the Gods path, in His will. We would recommend it to engaged couples."
2,"Impractical, Imperfect","We decided to use this book based on the recommendations of several friends and confidants. However, we were sorely disappointed. The book is extremely superficial in it's approach to marriage. The book's main point seems to be ""pray about everything and you'll be just fine"" when even the Bible doesn't say that. Unfortunately this seems to be a theme in Christian books: a list of things you shouldn't do, a list of things yo should do, but very little by way of practical advice on accomplishing those things. Additionally, this book leaves little room for disagreement or discussion of different concepts relating to marriage. Finally, the book does very little to actually provide advice on sex, finances, conflict resolution or child rearing, four of the most important components in a marriage. I would keep looking, rather than buy this particular book."
3,Very difficult to read.,"There was quite a bit of interesting information in the book. The book is written as a chronology of Washington's life. This in itself is not a bad thing, but it is done with very little coherency, rendering the book very difficult to read. The only reason I read it was because it was required reading at my school. I give it three stars because, while the writing style was terrible, the quality of the information it contains redeems it to a certain degree."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"Having lived in Osaka, Japan for six years, I am well aware of the extremely high level of artistic and technological talent to be found in that extraordinary country. I first heard this cd a few days ago and cannot get the music out of my head - It is so captivating. Listen to ""Shikisai no Blues"" and you will be blown away. I emphatically recommend this cd. It just might change your life!"
4,Sword and Sorceress IX,"When you find a golden treasure such as Sword and Sorceress IX, and the rest of the series KEEP ON BUYING them. The fact that the anthology series was compiled by such a great writer as was Marion Zimmer Bradley, just makes the series more delicious. By the time Sword and Sorceress IX, came along she had developed a really great stable of writers."
1,Worthless for 90 degree cuts,"The product description is misleading: there IS an attachment for doing 45 degree cuts and that works - not great but does work. The problem is that this tool does nothing to help with perfect 90 degree cuts. The description says you use the flat base for 90 degree cuts, but that doesn't really do anything for you. I can make cuts easier with a regular X-acto knife, or a single edge razor blade which is what I ended up using because I felt it gave me better control than this tool."
2,piece of junk,"It's very hard to use and does not give you what you want the quality is bad and once the blade get dull you will not find replacements, its good for just few inches else it's worthless"
1,"Terrible author, terrible book",Peggy Noonan is a biased commentator and frankly her views are outdated
1,Character Development?,"I can not remember the name of the main character. That isn't a bad memory, that's bad character development. I guess it would be hard to write a book about lawyers if you aren't one. The situations are realistic but thee author hasn't painted any lasting pictures. Even the book description talks more about the author than the book...HELLO!"
5,The People's Tenor,This is an absolutely brilliant CD. I listen to it all the time. Russell Watson has the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.I first heard Russell Watson when I was surfing through channels and I noticed that KTEH had some sort of concert on so I stopped and watched for a while and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. After a short time I found out who the singer was and the next morning I went to a store and bought it. Russell Watson is not only a good singer but also a great performer. He always seems to enjoy being on stage and I recommend this CD to anyone no matter what type of music you listen to. He really is the People's Tenor.
2,Too ambitious,"I tend to agree with those who said that Russell Watson was being too ambitious in tackling this type of program. The songs here require a first rate voice, a first rate technique and a first rate emotional response. Russell Watson can offer little of these here. The best part of the CD is its presentation. But that provides little compensation for the poor musical contents."
1,A jack of all trades,"The singer here is obviously a jack of all trades. But even more obviously, he is the master of none. He is here being over ambitious and want to do everything. Unfortunately, he does nothing in the right style. I don't think he has sung any piece even adequately. Not recommended."
5,A must have CD!,"I love music, I sing music and this CD makes me love it even more. I cry, soar, feel such intensity in his voice that I find I am immobile while listening. The best word I can find is orgasmic. I will buy this CD for anyone I value."
3,great voice but scratched,All the songs are great except for one that skips for some reason. Still worth the cost of .01!
5,Beautiful - moved me to tears,"I love Russell Watson's attitude that ""the music belongs to the people."" How wonderful that someone is finally making classical vocal music accessible to a world of people who would otherwise NEVER consider listening!Perhaps opera experts and purists might quibble with Watson's approach to the material, but he does have a remarkably pliant tenor. He is one of very few vocalists who can successfully sing both classical and popular material convincingly.This CD is well worth buying, for the music as well as for the inspiration. I am equally knocked out by the music and by the fact that Watson chucked in his safe job to go for his dream. Put this CD on whenver you're tempted to give up on your dreams."
4,Great listening,"After reading countless reviews both good and bad I finally went to get the ""controversial"" cd. Haha. Well it isn't as bad as some may think. As I am quite new in the genre of opera well all I can say is The Voice has given me delightful listening. Though there may be songs that seem a litle out of place well it adds colour to the album. Just give Russell some time to sort out his vocals and musical preferences and then you will be able to hear THE voice in the near future. (Wanted to give 4 and a half stars but couldn't!)"
1,A singer without much voice,"The title of this recording is ironical, for the singer has very little voice, as judged from the weak recordings here.I don't think Russell Watson is suitable for the demanding repertoire chosen for him. His defective technique and constricted vocals are incapable for performing the music.Can give this a miss."
1,No match for Bocelli,"I'd urge those who think that Russell Watson is good to listen to the superb Andrea Bocelli. Both singers are doing cross-overs but Bocelli has a much more beautiful voice, a much better technique and he sings with more charm and, above all, a heart. Russell Watson is just no match for Bocelli, who is genuinely great!"
4,Very very good,"""The Voice"" is definately on par with other popular tenors such as Andrea Bocelli and any of the Three Tenors. It was nice to get a sampling of not just operatic material, but also popular songs as well. Can't wait for his next CD!"
5,Simply A Sexy CD,"I am not an opera fan, and I listen on rare occasion to classical music. However, this CD allows anyone to enjoy such genre. After hearing him sing ""Funiculi-funicula"" on the NHL Awards, I purchased the CD the following day and haven't stopped listening to it. One word to describe the whole CD: Sexy. The best example is through ""Someone Like You."" He also throws in an interesting twist with his rendition of songs from the late Freddie Mercury, ""Vienna"" and ""Barcelona."" If you ever were taking a chance on a CD, this is the one."
1,Absolutely horrifying,"This album is so bad that I can't even find a single song on the CD to justify the inflated price. People: just because the fellow has a soft voice and the music is filled with luscious, bright strings, enhanced with a hefty dose of reverb, doesn't mean that there is any quality music here. I am afraid that a lot of the listeners who gave a positive review of this CD have never really heard quality music."
1,The Voice Of What?,I regret that there was no option to give this recording ZERO stars. It certainly earned the rating. I really hope this guy didn't sell his welding gear -- he may need it to make a living.
5,Fabulous voice,"When I first heard Russell Watson sing Caruso on Television, it sent shivers down my spine. When I then heard Watson's operatic voice on the VOICE, I thought what a feast to have his wonderful rendition of Caruso and his fabulous other voices. I cannot understand how anyone can claim Watson has a limited and screeching voice. I believe Russell Watson will become one of the great tenors as he matures. This CD is a most attractive album."
1,Overly produced CD,"After hearing Russell Watson spotlighted on CBS Sunday morning recently, I bought this CD to hear more. Unfortunately, I can't tell what kind of voice he has, the CD is so poorly produced with the arrangement/musicians overshadowing his singing. Sorry I bought it."
1,No match for Safina,"Russell Watson is no match for Safina, who sings much better and has a more macho image. I think Watson will only be a 3-day wonder. His recordings will soon be forgotten once the public becomes bored by his boring performances.I'll give this 1 star."
1,STAR TREK,"This is the person who sings ""Faith of the Heart"", the theme song to the new Star Trek series on UPN, Enterprise.Its going to be included on his next album."
5,An excellent introduction to the subject,"Southern's brief overview of western perceptions of Islam during the Middle Ages is extremely engaging. He has the rare gift of being able to combine good scholarship with flowing, entertaining prose.Southern begins his discussion in the tenth century, when Europe had scarcely heard of Muhammad, and ends with the fifteenth, with the rise of the Ottoman empire. He investigates how medieval theologians perceived the role of Islam in Christian and world history, and outlines the intellectual and theological ramifications of the west's introduction to Islamic philosophy, along the way introducing the reader to some of the major religious and intellectual figures who played roles in the encounter.The entire book is just over a hundred pages - you'll wish it was longer."
4,One for your personal library,"A comprehensive look at Pentecostalism, its roots, and ""3 waves"" of history. Synan is one of the leading scholars in this field. Strong data on the Holiness movement and very early Pentecostals. Moderately good information on the Charismatic Renewal. Not much on the Jesus Movement and new paradigm churches, but overall, this book is great for anyone interested in how Pentecostalism has become so big and popular in just one century. Plenty of details and footnotes for researchers."
5,Henry Mancini Goes Latin,I am presently ordering this CD. I have been searching for this album for many years. I have the original album on LP. The songs are of top quality and relate very much to the Latino culture. Anyone listening to any song within this album will relate and sway with the beat. Your soul can't help but dance to the music.
4,disappointment,"We were disappointed because the hammock came wihout the promised hanging apparatus. It looks like a very nice hammock; but will have to return it...unless you can send separately the hanging ropes. Thank you so much. Grace Payton...also, do you not carry the Eddie Bauer Hammocks anymore?"
3,"hot eros, video a bit lacking","I bought this DVD mostly because I wanted to view the music videos. There are only 3 videos on this DVD, and they are hidden: buried in the extras. It was disappointing, but I can't video elsewhere of the music videos that are on his web site. It's interesting to see Eros live, however, and the video quality is good. Even more interesting to see his interaction with his child, who he has sing a song: when she forgets the words, he gets upset, and overpowers her with his voice. Cher seems to be a kind of freak, but I suppose that's what you've got to be to succeed at that level."
1,Worst Program Ever,I never got this thing running. My computer exceeds all of the specs required to work this thing and it crashed and crashed and crashed. Do not purchase this whatever you do.
2,cannot recommend this software,"I really cannot recommend this software. I don't know why DeLorme refuses to use the simple windows interface. Nothing is where you would expect it to be. There isn't even a simple ""Save As"" dialog box. There is no way to name anything the way YOU want to name it and the print dialog box doesn't allow you to just print a couple of the pages you need from a 30 page document.This really is NOT good software.don't buy it."
5,Markedly great,"Any horror or Udo Kier fans will want to own this movie for their collections. This was the first movie to receive a rating of ""V"" for violence back in the day. Supposedly when you went to see the movie, the ticket came with a barf bag because it was supposed to be so graphic, not so by today's standards. It is a period piece and although it's a little dated, it's kind of camp and a lot of fun. Udo Kier never looked better. It has a decent plot, the scenery is beautiful and the acting is okay."
2,COULD BE BETTER,I thought this CD would be filled with the tracks from the show that touch you the most. Like when the sister finally got rid of Cole that was a good song. They could have had some songs from the first three season too. This ablum COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I just hope when the shows DVD's come out they don't mirror this ablum. ANYHOW CHARMED STILL ROCKS!
4,Songs for the Young,"This is a very uplifting soundtrack. It is very good and very smoothly put together. One point to note is that there songs are very loud and rock-ish, so for people who like the gentle tracks found in Gilmore Girls OST this is not the album for you. Also, if you only buying music from known artists, do not buy this album. The tunes are good but unheard of. Most of the songs are usually from the ending scenes in P3, Piper's club, and some are shown in the starting scenes of the San Franscisco citylights. If you've liked a particular song while watching the show, get its title and match it with the songs on this album. Do not buy the album straight away because most of the songs in the album can go either way based on the buyer's preference of music. Some people might like some songs but some might hate them. Overall, an okay album."
5,music,"this is a great music cd, i listen to it all the time would get another one if i could and I also enjoy the others in the series. the show is great also has alot of great messages for anyone open to learn."
3,"Enjoyable, but utterly inconsequential.","This is a fun book to read while living in or visiting Boston, but as ""escapist"" reading, it doesn't really work -- at least not for me. Make sure you're in a good mood before you start reading; if not, you may be annoyed by the sheer triviality of the proceedings."
5,GOOD BARGAIN...AGAIN?,"Again ASIN: B000CCBCEE and B000C1VBBE seem to be the same only one set is cheaper. Overall the quality of this set is very good. One thing I will mention is that other reviewers on some of the single titles have noticed that the films are edited. That seems to be the case fo The Mad Bomber. The other titles I don't know. One of the main reasons I got this was for Horror Express. When the opening credits rolled I groaned because the colors were initailly dull and blurry, but once the credits were over the image quality improved greatly. Also, for some reason there are no ending credits. The typical credit music plays but there is a blank screen. A short synopsis.The Baby-average story/great image quality.(suprise ending)Crucible of Terror-great(IMHO) story/great image quality.Psychomania-good story/great image quality.The House of Seven Corpses-poor story/great image quality.Horror Express-great story/great image quality.The Mad Bomber-average story/great image quality."
2,IT sux,"No offense to those of you who enjoyed this book, but I personally found it wholly unfulilling. I found the main charactors dessions to be ridicious, unintegligent and downright disgusting. The girl in this book dates my uncle, It's gross."
2,MASTER OF ANIMATION,"PRACTICALLY NONE OF THE U.S. AMERICAN ANIMATION LEGENTS SHOWS IN THIS NICELY PUBLICATION.NONE ON FLEISCHER'S, WALTER LANTZ, PAUL TERRY, GEORGE PAL'S PUPPETOONS AND SO MANY OTHERS...."
2,Hands down the worst Kaiju movie I have ever seen.,"Being a massively obsessed kaiju fan I of course had to buy this one. However I can assure you that this movie is by far the worst Kaiju movie I have ever seen. Unless you count the Korean film APE, that one was pretty bad. Why did I give it a two? Well for kaiju completionists like myself I still consider this an essential. For everyone else, Stay Away..."
1,Design Defect in Make Copy Mode.,"The make copy button on the front of the scanner and in the software does not work properly. In my case it makes copies only in draft mode. After getting the runaround from tech support, and even exchanging the scanner for a new one, tech support admitted to me that ""make copy"" doesn't work. In some cases it prints nothing, in others it just prints in draft. The gave me a ""workaround."" Scan it as a picture, then tell it to go directly to the printer. But then the copies don't look like the originals. What really makes me made is that they must have known this all the time, and they just wasted my time and tried to wear me down. I'm returning mine and buying another brand."
2,Multiple failures,"I have approximately 10,000 slides to scan. I purchased the 4850 and after about 3,000 slides began to get three to four dark blue lines across the image. After reporting it to HP they sent me a replacement TMA. The new TMA worked fine for the first 450 slides and then BINGO, I now am getting two dark blue lines again. I think the machine is not engineered to handle the work load I have."
2,HP Scanjet 4850 Photo Scanner,Scans photos and documents fairly well. Film and slide scanning dificult at best. The instructions are very poor giving only the very basic directions for use with no help in using any of the advanced functions. On line help is not much better. Would not buy another unit.
2,Save your money,"Yes, there are many books out there on using Google. Yes, this is a good book for teaching the new user about using Google. But this information can easily be found anywhere on the Internet. The only chapter I found useful was the advanced searching portion. I read that in less than five minutes, however, and I am far from being a speed reader.Also, it is only a matter of time before the information becomes outdated. It may already be outdated. Google is constantly changing and being updated (Google Labs) and a lot of this book will be useless by next year.Finally, Google is very easy and simple to learn. Anyone can be a ""power searcher"" after learning just a few short lessons. You don't have to spend this much money to get a book that you can read in about five minutes."
5,Quick inspiring read,"John has created an inspiring read, with real world examples of just how important it is to (decide to) be a contagious leader. I especially liked his attention to defining charater. What is Character? How is it defined? You'll have to read the book to find out.It's worth the time and money."
5,Gorgeous!,"AMAZING ring! Looks much better than the picture! Just heed my advice and do not use DHL. They have messed up so many deliveries amongst my family and friends. They even messed up the shipment of this ring; it was shipped 2 day air and I received it about 5 days later. Go with UPS or FedEx, their drivers have more sense. Other than the shipping, I was so thrilled with this purchase!"
4,Another excellent read in the Fables saga,"""Fables: The Mean Seasons"" is the fifth volume in Bill Willingham's 'Fables' series and provides yet another compelling and engaging read for fans of the series. While 2/3'rds of this book is required narrative for the advancement of the storyline, this book includes a few chapters of side stories and flashbacks that I found to be the highlights of this volume. In particular, 2 chapters are devoted to a WW2 flashback of Bigby Wolf's adventures in Nazi occupied Europe. Don't skip this book if you've been following the series up to this point."
3,OCEANSIDE!!!!!,"Growing up in Oceanside is just another reminder of a town and period of my life that was so vastly important as to keep it in ""my mind's eye"" for a very long period."
3,Not OEM,"Don't expect original equipment replacement. It is kind of flimsy. I can't tell if it will last, time will tell. They make most of these shut off valves so that you can't repair them. It was still cheaper than buying a new sprayer."
2,Repetitive and tendentious,"This book contains some useful information about moving to Mexico, but it is a chore to read. That's because the author repeats his strong opinions so often that he becomes very annoying.Yes, you advised us to avoid gated American communities and instead, live in areas that include some local people. Yes, you advised us to learn Spanish. Yes, you told us not to insult the locals. Yes, you told us not to expect everything to be like the USA.Now: We heard ya the first time, buddy!!! STOP the 3X-4X rants on each of those subjects!Useful but flawed. As another reviewer said, this could have been a good, longish magazine article but instead, it was puffed up into a book by repeating much of the material multiple times."
4,Good short scenes,"I have found this book very useful for doing short scene study work. The scenes span much of the career of Lanford Wilson from his earlier experimental short pieces like ""Wanderng"" to his more realism based scenes like ""Eukiah"" Lanford Wilson is one of the great contemporary American playwrights."
5,great value!,"These aviators are a great value. They are a lot of fun, especially if you take the time to read the tags. While I do not think that I would use them as everyday sun glasses they are perfect for prizes and parties! The shipping from this company was lightning fast!"
4,Nice,"Very nice, just what i wanted for a bunch of diskettes that came with my computer when i got it. I really dont have other disks, but this will be nice to store more in when i get them."
2,It doesn't fit!,"Purchased based on user manual indication supplied with Brother typewriter purchased from Amazon. Although the ribbons and lift off tape were fine, the script wheel did not fit the typewriter! I would not recommend this kit if your priority is the script wheel."
5,"A book worthy of ""classic""","I first found this book in the library when I was in the third grade. I read it and loved it. It was my favorite book for years after that. I was so disappointed when I discovered that this book was out of print. It is one of the few books that are truely worthy of the title ""classic"". Once you read this book, you'll remember it forever. I think that is really what a classic is, not a book that controversial or written a long time ago, but a book that stays with you for the rest of your life. And for me, this book is truely is a classic."
5,A wonderful fairy tale.,"This is a time when fairy tales are in the vogue. The tie in with Lavender Blue, the Disney/Burl Ives song, added to the intrigue. I found myself singing the ditty in my head -along with the Prince."
2,Stinky....,"not one of my faves from ntrl bal. im a huge fan of the dry foods but this food (additive) seemed harsh and smelly. first of all it seems weird to me that its not frozen on chilled when you buy it. what i did was open it up, take all the wrapping off, cut it in 1/4"" medallions then freeze it. when i thaw it, i use hot water and mix it in dry food. it makes the kitchen stink. i use paw naturaw or the one with the rainbow label."
3,Does NOT work on Win7 64 bit,"Firstly, a word of warning - this will not work on Windows 7 Pro x64 - I've tried every trick I know and it would not load correctly. I'm now using it on my Win XP netbook instead.So far I've found the software fairly good - I've mainly been using the flashcards so far. The interface is a little old to use, but given what I paid, it's a good start at learning some of the vocab at least!"
4,Great Poet!,"I read and loved the the eponymous titled poem years ago in the New Yorker. My sister made me a calligraphy copy of it for my wall. (This was in 1993 I think...) So when this collection came out I bought it. I have been reading this a little bit at a time, and am pleased with it. I also looked Ornsby up online and read a bit about his background. It added to my interest."
1,"Bought 2, one works","Bought two compasses for my employees to use. They both worked for a few weeks. Now one of them gets stuck and is not accurate at all. The other one is still working mostly, but sticks some of the time. Not a very good compass for when you are depending on accuracy."
1,Failed To do its job,"I double, triple and quadruple checked and every time I try to get an accurate heading, the compass is way off."
4,Gold amidst Rubbish,"I love Barry Long, but like many spiritual teachers, you have to take what you recognize form within and move on. A definite good absorbtion on your spiritual journey but ultimately not the holy grail. Barry was a conscious man, but some of the things he says I just cannot find in my own experience. The energy of this material is enough to feed the spirit in you though. Ingest it."
3,Groove Armada - But I Feel Good,"Groove Armada's foray into good ol' soundboy dub, _But I Feel Good_, provides plenty of finger-snapping fun, even if it's somewhat disposable. The Audio Bullys' ""Dr. Feelgood Mix"" offer up some grimy house, while Murk, unsurprisingly, throw in some deep and dark Miami bass for their ""Miami Downtown Mix."" How dark? Well, even the catchy chorus seems a little ominous. Does it feel good? Sure, but sometimes you ache for something more, too."
1,I love the show but the download is useless,I wanted this to download into the Kindles memory so my kid could play this show in the car while on long drives. Unfortunately it won't play unless you're connected to the net. Neither can I get a refund. I'm not very happy.
4,Better Than A Slap Across The Face,"I heard about this CD from a friend and decided to check it out. I couldn't believe my ears... finally someone who has musical talent and who knows how to rock. No watering down the sound here. Eddie Kramer (Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, etc.) puts an excellent touch on this CD. It's even better hearing the songs performed live. Thank god he lives in SoCal so there are many opportunities to catch Eric. He puts on an awesome show. If you're sick of the same garbage being churned out by the big boys, then this CD is for you. You will not be dissapointed."
2,I tried to like it....,"After hearing so much about this guy I thought I'd check it out. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. First things first, the songwriting is medicore at best. The lyrics really lack any substance. As far as the electric dobro thing, it's a novel idea: thus, making it a novelty. I can't get over the feeling that this is more of a gimmick than a viable artist. His rhythm section is pretty solid. You don't have to do much with a one regular format all day. And last, this guy's voice just isn't very good. I will say he performs well live. He exudes lots of energy and really knows how to entertain. The production quality is very good, thanks to Eddie Kramer. Not sure why he picked up this project, but....Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this CD if you're looking for substance, musicality, or well written songs."
1,Modern dissonant music,"The entire CD is a modern dissonant music played by the Eastman Wind Ensemble. If you like such music, this CD is for you. But if you love classical music by Beethoven, Mozart, Rossini, Strauss, Wagner and other great composers of the classical era, you will be very disappointed, like we are. The entire recording sounds like a high school band playing off key. It is not the fault of the orchestra, still one of the top wind ensembles in the world, but of the conductor who has very unusual taste in music. We personally detest his music selections. We would love it if the Eastman Wind Ensemble made some new recordings of marches by John Philip Sousa, which they perform so well, instead of the dissonant music on this CD."
5,Perfect replacement,This was the perfect replacement part for my Chapin sprayer. It arrived just a few days after I placed the order and only took a few minutes to install.
4,Cute book,"This book is very cute! In a poetic style writing, the author brings imagination to the table. It has a underlying moral to the story. This book has some vocabulary words that may be too advanced for the younger children (below age 7-8). However, it is a very creative book. Who would have thought of people being arrows?"
3,funny cd but scratched,"The cd is awesome .really fast shipping..wrote to seller about the fact that its scratched on track 16 and 17 but no response..other than the 2 tracks that I cant play, the CD is great and I love it.The 2 bad tracks arent that great of songs anyway but still its the fact of the matter."
4,R-rated Puppet Delight,"Avenue Q is like Sesame Street with hormones. Be prepared for lots of racy material and you'll laugh a LOT. Great songs like ""What Do You Do With A BA in English?""!"
5,Touchstone for Humour,"Notwithstanding the puppets, this is a show for adults and the soundtrack reflects that, not just in language, but also in subject matter (masturbation, ennui, schadenfreude and unemployment among others). If you don't find at least one song side splittingly funny, then you probably do not have a sense of humour. This is a funny, funny soundtrack. There are moments of emotion and a little drama, but mostly the message is conveyed through very pointed humour.If you are the sort of person who needs jokes explained, avoid this album. If you value things based upon their social relevance, then you need the attitudes this album would impart, but you would probably hate it. However, if you are relaxed about yourself and can take a joke, then you'll laugh a lot."
5,The Rosetta Stone for Knitters,"I bought some yarn once at the Rekyavik Airport (a beautiful Lopi, of course.) Some elegant patterns for pullovers were included, but they were in Icelandic, German and Norwegian. Lucky for me, I speak German. But not KNITTING German. What is ""umschlag"" and ""abnehmen?"" I can guess, but...I'd like to be sure.There are many wonderful patterns available in French, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish and Italian. This book helps you translate the most common terms used in knitting for most of the European languages and even...Japanese. With a set of charts, you will find that knitting in translation is not all that difficult. This is the Rosetta Stone for knitters and really, if you are a serious knitter and want to explore the delights of foreign patterns, this is a must-have."
2,Fun for the 2 days the batteries last!,"This thing sucks batteries! Which is amazing, because it only has 6 LED's on it.I'm assuming its either a design flaw or poor manufacture, but having to replace the 3 AAA batteries every two days for standard use got old real fast.I'd stay away from this one."
2,Marginal at best,"When I was a kid in the 60s, I recorded the entire soundtrack from ""Horse Feathers"" on a hand-held cassette deck. Quite frankly, the sound quality on this CD is worse, especially in the ""Cocoanuts"" numbers; they're so muddy as to be almost unlistenable. In addition, the collection includes some of the strangest choices; the Brothers singing ""Sweet Adeline"" inside a packing crate from the movie ""Monkey Business""? One can only assume that the producers needed padding. There are some great numbers here, but it's work getting to them."
4,RE: Song Title Help,"You can also try the song by James ""Laid"". I haven't listened to the album yet to hear the version of ""Laid"" by the other artist. The one mentioned above is a old popular one!"
2,what's this called??,"what is the name of the song that is played in the beginning of the movie? it has something like, the neighbors complain about the noises above, in it. please help!!"
2,into the mystic,"the wallflowers pretty much distilled everything that was unique and beautiful about van morrison's into the mystic and eliminated it, thus producing a sacharrined, sadly boring version that could have been done by pretty much anyone."
3,help,"Ive been trying to find the song from the film which is played when michelle is looking for her wedding dress, i havent a clue what it is and it itsnt on the sound track. Can anyone help?!"
2,Only good song is the first,"People call this a rock cd...whoever calls this a rock cd doesn't truly listen to rock, this music is mainstream music it is more pop than it is rock with the HUGE exception of Times Like These by the Foo Fighters that is the only song on this cd that made me give it 2 stars instead of 1. If u are truly a rock fan do not buy this cd instead buy one by one the cd that the foo fighters song is on cuz all the songs are rock like Times Like These. If u like mainstream stuff this whole cd is excellent for u however if u are a real rock fan u should know to stay away from this kinda stuff."
1,still looking for a song,I am looking for a particular song from the movie that I don't see on this album. It is right at the end of the movie but before the sugarcult song. Any ideas?
4,Laid,"Greg,I think the song you are referring to is ""Laid"" by Matt Nathanson. The song appears at the end credits and seems to be the one used for all the promotional stuff and also appears on the dvd menu. The song was originally done by an artist called ""James"" a few years ago. Great song!"
5,This author is a genius!,"I love this book. All of our relationships are started and maintained by good communication, or not! This author gives invaluable insights."
1,Just plain awful,"This software is simply unusable. The routes generated on the PDA bear no relationship to reality, the verbal instructions to turn occur as you are passing the turn, not before, and the tech support just ignores you. Avoid at all costs."
3,Haunted Heart,"My past experience listening to other divas effort to crossover into the pop world has been disappointing. Out of curiosity I purchased Haunted Heart and was pleasantly surprised to hear her smooth and easey ballad style. Though her singing lacks spontaneity, richness of her voice is worth listening."
2,Not for me,"I really wanted to like this. I am not a great fan of Ms Fleming's opera work. I find her pretentious, syrupy, sugary and sentimentalized. Also, I watched her last year sing ""Silent Night"" on TV and it was just awful. I know she has lots of fans, and I am so sorry because I so wanted to love this new style for her. But, yet again it was just impossibly earnest. No lightness of touch and pathos for the material, just a dirge, especially ""Answer Me"".Even ""River"" -- husky and long breathy notes does not a style make. Apart from the great Joni Mitchell, just listen the Sarah MacLachlan's recording and it breaks your heart. Renee Fleming does not convince. Overly rehearsed and too pre-conceived without any spontaneity."
4,Lovely & Soulful,"Call me crazy, but I, having never heard of Renee Fleming, stumbled upon her by sheer accident. Seeing Fred Hersch's name on the cd, I figured I'd try it since I enjoy him. My first thoughts when I heard her voice were: ""low, deep... different"". I now see from reading a little info that she lowered herself an octave for this cd. I am anxious to hear more of her.This cd is lush & dark, and very relaxing. I imagine when fall or winter approaches I will curl up with this one quite often!"
4,One of my favorites,"I keep checking this book out of the library, so I guess I'm just going to have to break down and buy my own copy. It is one of the two vegetable cookbooks I turn to again and again, the other being Deborah Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone"". Several recipes are given for each vegetable, and most are easy to prepare. If you want to include a varied selection of vegetables in your diet, and you want eating them to be a pleasure, then this book will serve you well."
4,The recipes sound yummy!,"I would like to have this book and perhaps in the future I will buy a copy. Some people may not like it because the author doesn't mind using cream, oil, wine and cheese. To me, it gives food flavor and good mouth-feel. That's important to me. I rather enjoy my food than to constantly worry about my health. I don't need to be super slim. And the French eat rich foods, and they are not as fat as us Americans. We eat too much, that's the problem."
4,Great Water Purifier,"I currently own two of these and have used these on many backpacking trips. Keep this in mind... a water filter gets rid of protozoa and parasites, even bacteria, but it does not remove viruses. A water purifier eliminates all of these plus viruses.PROSProduces great water, no need to worry about quality. Pump purifies water on up and down stroke. Comes with carry case to keep hoses and small attachments together. Good lifespan on the cartridges.CONSA little on the heavy and bulky side, weighs about 1 pound. The older models have issues with hoses popping off but I fixed with cable ties. Leaks a little around the seals.OVERALLGood design, quality product.... It works for me.[...]"
5,The GLOBALIST FANTASY EXPOSED!,"A scary must read for those concerned about the country's future. If you feel the uneasy economic chill in the air, this book will explain why! If your city's industrial base is gone this book will explain why! If you are stuck in a minimum wage ""temp"" society this book will explain why! This book exposes the neo-con globalist fantasy for what it is...Free trade is not free! and Cheap labor is not cheap! Unfortunately this book does not explain why no one seems to care!!!!"
5,Setting the Record Straight,"At last, a thorough and balanced account of the life and times of one of the great musicians of the last half of the 20th century, whose personal struggles prevented him from enjoying his fame and cementing his reputation. Most people still think Santana wrote ""Black Magic Woman.""Until now it's been maddeningly difficult to get much solid information on the phases of Green's career; other than Mick Fleetwood's autobiography, which leaves many questions unanswered, there hasn't been a good reference. This fine volume also includes an authoritative discography and sessionography. A must for any Green fan."
5,Excellent!!!,An excellent read! The poetry is phenomenal. The best I've read in a long time. Highly recommended!
2,Not attractive as wall phone,"I bought this to use as a wall phone. The mount that goes on the wall was 4"" deep. This made the phone stand out too far from the wall. It was not aesthetically appealing."
2,Constant hissing sound,"I love the aesthetics of this phone and so I am very very sad that I have to return it. The voice quality of the handset is just fine, the speaker phone is great, I love that it glows blue, but while on the handset, in the background I hear a constant hiss. In order to make the hiss go away I have to turn the handset volume way down, and then I have trouble hearing the person on the other end of the phone. And my hearing is just fine. So back it goes. Why is it that my 900Mz 4+ year old GE phone is much better quality than all these expensive new phones? I am tired of having to buy a new phone every six months."
2,Short-lived quality,"The phone has cool features that worked fine while it lasted...1 year 9 months after purchase, base stopped charging the handset. Simultaneously, additional handset battery died, although it was purchased 5 months after the base! Replacement battery does not charge on the receivers, despite correct specifications. Too expensive a phone for such a short life!"
4,5.8 GHz or 2.4 GHz (buyer beware),"There are probably many reasons why one would purchase a 5.8 GHz phone; promised better clarity, newest features, but many people may be like me who are searching for a cordless phone that does not interfere with their wireless LAN which operates at 2.4 GHz. I previously had a 900 MHz phone which worked fine until the keys failed and I was looking for a replacement. I selected the Motorola phone as it was advertised as a pure 5.8 GHz phone. Some other phones sold by AT&T; and Uniden identified that they use other frequencies like 2.4 GHz in addition to 5.8 GHz and so I eliminated these from consideration.Overall the performance has been good. The signal is very good most of the time, but I have had instances where ghosting appears. The phone is easy to use and well designed."
1,Very upset ...,"I was very upset when I got this phone, specifically upon finding out through Motorola (since as far as I could find, it doesn't say this ANYWHERE in the literature) that the phone receives on the 5.8 GHz frequency, but sends on the 2.4 GHz frequency! That means, for all you wireless network users, that this phone will most likely play havoc with your signal until you play with your network to fix it. You CANNOT modulate the phone's signal to fix it. It's a real bummer.Everyone should know this before buying it -- it's a pity Motorola chooses to hide this fact, because for someone like me, I had to choose between my wireless network or the phone. I chose the wireless network!Hope you have more luck than me!"
1,Poor quality control,"I just returned both my base phone (from Amazon) and two handsets (from Office Depot). The handset that came with the base did not work in the sense that it never picked up a dial tone even though it was fully charged, had ""found"" the base station, and the speaker phone in the base station had a dial tone.One of the two extra handsets had very poor reception; it wasn't the location of the handset, as the third one worked perfectly wherever the second one did not.I'd say that Motorola was (is) lacking some in the quality control department."
3,Better n not the best,I have been using this phone for a month now and It has all the features that a modern telephone should have with simplicity of usage. I see a problem with the battery as it never showed me its fully charged even after its kept charging for 24 hours. The voice is pretty clear. Wish even the base unit had key-pad backlit display. Overall I would say one wouldnt regret buying this phone.
4,"So far, a gem...","Have been using it for at least 3 weeks now...Nice little unknown feature like blinking erie blue light when extension is being used.Doesn't heat up too bad after night of charging like our other wireless phones, and the batteries are AA unlike the special expensive battery in the other one.So far, were digging it."
3,Newfangled Neato,"The phone is surprisingly durable, the sound quality is superb and the battery life seems neverending. Some of the newfangled features (or at least to this late cool-phone adopter) can stand for some improvement: You can't hear the numbers as they're being dialed, so if you're not focused on the screen it's easy to think a number hasn't registered and redial it; the voice message notifier will keep blinking until you clear out your voice-mail, which makes it a little distracting when you'd rather go straigt to sleep than pick up the phone (that flashing blue light is more powerful than it looks!); the caller-id log registers separately on the handset and the base station, so you have to clear out the log separately for both, which is annoyingly duplicitous. All in all, though, it is a fantastic phone for the money."
3,ND671 Motorola phone,"I purchased this 5.8 GHz phone to try and eliminate a problem casued by a 2.4 GHz phone, which was interfering with a wireless computer network link in a study. The new phone did not solve the problem; a call to Motorola indcated that there was a 2.4 connection between the handset and the base; there was nothing in the description of the phone on your website that indicated this fact. I like the phone better thatn the one it replaced, but I am unhappy because my original problem has not yet been resolved."
5,Best speaker phone I have ever used!,"I just purchased this phone, and it is the best speaker phone system I have ever encountered! This 5.8 GHz system is clear as a bell - you can even have 2-way interaction while on the speaker phone (the other voice does NOT cut out! It does get slightly softer, but you can still hear the other person's reactions and responses while you are talking!) It also has a digital cordless handset - which ALSO can be used as a speakerphone! I have always trusted the ""Motorola"" name, and I couldn't be happier with this phone system!"
5,WOW!,"This is an excellent, old, but still accurate explination of Aeronautic Navigation. It explains the subject in very clear terms, and wastes no space or time with filler nonsense, like almost all modern texts. If you can find a copy, get it. (I'm holding on to mine!) :)"
5,One of my favorite young adult books - in 1968,"I'm looking to find a copy for my children; this was one of those magical books I read over and over in the library when I was, say, 10 years old; in the aftermath of a catastrophic event (nuclear war?), survivors' descendants live their lives underground... I can't really remember much more... I hope I can find it some day. (Other masterful magical books: Golden Goblet, Follow My Leader, and Wrinkle In Time!)"
2,Hogwash? The Facts Say Yes!,"This updated version of his earlier book provides nothing that wasn't already nonsense before. Gish continues his long-standing tactic of misquoting out of date books and simply ignoring or even distorting the actual data regarding the fossil record. Even hard-core creationists are unlikely to find much worth saying about this book since it simply repeats the standard creationist dogma (""no transitional fossils....no transitional fossils""...repeat until your audience is bored) without even trying to force more recent evidence to fit into his twisted version of pseudo-science. It seems that he merely removed parts of the original version of the book which were so astoundingly false that even he was unable to defend them with a straight face. I might classify this table leg-leveler as humor if it weren't taken as real science by so many naive and uninformed members of the public. Suffice to say that science isn't the least bit worried. Save your pennies."
1,Sad,"One has to wonder if Mr Gish is truly as ignorant as his ideas and conclusions present him to be, or whether he is deliberately misleading a gullible and traditionally undereducated Creationist audience. I tend to think the latter, since he so cleverly distorts and manipulates the overwhelming evidence for evolution. Unfortunately most Creation fundamentalists believe that if you intone a belief with enough frequency, it eventually becomes 'the truth'.Pretty transparent stuff."
2,Dear Travis,Einstein's Relativity theories have had so many holes poked in them that they're starting to look like Swiss cheese and we have Quantum Physics to thank for it. Please refrain from putting them in the same context.
2,smells like muscle rub,"I got this product in addition to several others from the same company for my daughters hair. I really liked all of the other products, but this one isnt very tingly, doesnt seem like shampoo, and smells like muscle rub. I am not a dreadlock expert, and I dont know exactly what dreadlock shampoo is supposed to be like, but it doesnt seem to take the wax buildup out of her hair, and I am currently in the long and painful process of trying to take the dreads out of her hair. Im not impressed with this but I guess I might have been if I knew more what to expect from a dread shampoo."
1,Disappointing!,"The camera arrived with such poor instructions that I was baffled about all of the specifics. Everything clearly labeled on the camera was identified in the ""User guide"" but the more detailed functions were not described anywhere! I did some research from the Polaroid site, but it did not help either. I thought I was crazy because I could not make the pictures come out right (even though I have used digital cameras before!)-then, I finally realized that the thing was broken and the company refused to take it back because I was past my 30 day return allotment."
2,"Gets your heartrate up, but is complicated","I'm sure this is a great DVD for more coordinated people, but it makes me feel even more clumsy than normal. It gets my heart rate up, but is hard to follow. I always feel like I'm a step behind. Plus, the girls on the video are rather obnoxious (not only because they are skinny and perky). It may be more enjoyable once I did it enough to learn all the moves, but I don't know if I will ever use it often enough for that to happen. Overall, I would not recommend this DVD unless you are a skilled dancer/ athlete."
3,Cute But Cheesy,"This DVD definately keeps you moving, but it is straight out of the 80's. I'm not really in to 80's aerobics and had hoped that this DVD would be sexier."
2,*It only vibrates...,"*I had a Homedics one that I loved, but it gave out after a month, and a half so I wanted to replace it. I can no longer find one anywhere so I bought this assuming it worked the same way. Unlike the other microderm system this doesn't spin. It just vibrates. It didn't do anything my fingertips couldn't do. The exfoliation cream worked well, but the tool wasn't worth the purchase. It would be unsanitary to return an item like this so I'll just take it as a loss."
3,"good, but not the best","I used the product but was not impressed with the speed of the motor. I tried a different one from the beauty supply store and found the cream to have a better, more coarse texture and the motor was more powerful and gave a better ""wake up"" to my skin. If your skin is more sensitive, this is probably a better product, but I was looking for a little more abrasion."
5,StreetWires PSK04Ri,"This product was perfect for the application. The right amount of product all-in-one, at the right price."
4,Good Set of Sheets,"Well, I have been using the sheet set for approx. 45 days now, it's been through 2 or 3 wash cycles and they up pretty well. As mentioned the embroidery is very elegant and extensive giving the sheets a very rich look. There has been no shrinkage to speak off and they fit my 18"" Sealy comfortably. The sheets did have a nice satin sheen to them new, though that has dulled a bit in the wash; they are smooth to sleep on though I do doubt the accuracy of the thread count. Overall a good buy that I would repeat."
2,effective but uncomfortable,"These are extremely effective. I use them for studying in my less than quiet dorm room. They are wonderful, I can't hear a thing my roommate does, but they are pretty tight. They put pressure on my ears and are uncomfortable for long periods of time. Do not buy for studying."
3,pulls,"we are satisfied with this product, however the uniformity of gloss and color could have been quite a bit better..."
4,Small,"This was a lot smaller than I imagined, but my Golden Retriever Loved it. In my opinion, a lot healthier than rawhide or pig hide."
1,Nothing More Than Right-Wing Propaganda,"This book is nothing more than right-wing propaganda. The author blames the 70s for everything he and other right-wingers hate: progress. In my opinion, we won more freedom and rights in this decade. David Frum is just using this book as an excuse to put down the progress, freedom, and rights that we have won over the last 30 years."
4,Interesting slant on a maligned decade.,"David Frum can write, and he takes a subject that usually gets superficial treatment, and comes up with some very good insights. An awful lot of traditions, and social norms, and political, civil, and infrastructural trends were forever broken or altered in the seventies, a lot more than the sixties, the supposed great decade of radical change and revolution.Overall, a good read. The sections on activist judges and the civil rights movement and the school riots in Boston was especially enlightening. A good book, but hard to categorize--not truly a history book, not popular reading, and not especially light reading or fun fare. I think, though, that it can be rewarding.I learned of this book through National Review Online, so I expected it to be very conservative, and I didn't find it that way at all."
2,Obsolete Product,I ordered this product in June and didn't get around to trying it out until it was too late to return it. The built-in WiFi finder works great but I'm not able to use it with my netbook. I went to the ZyXEL website and the product is note even listed!(sigh)
2,Not a Happy Camper,"I bought this product because it was supposed to work with Macs. I was svery disappointed in the results. I was under the impression I could plug it in to a USB outlet and hook up to my local wifi network. First, I had to download the driver and I couldn't get that to work with a Mac. Ended up having to borrow a PC to download the Mac drivers. Then, and still, am having troubles installing the driver such that the product works like it should. Have sent several emails to Zyxel for help and received only a standard automatic reply. To put it bluntly, they were no help. The product finds the wifi network but will not connect to it.Hac"
2,"Slow,, very slow",This product produces a slow flow due to its design. I bought it because a reviewer said it fits a Nalgene water bottle. And it will fit some. But the flow of water from it is very slow. I would not but it again. I would not even use it on a Dromedary water bag. The water bag nozzle is good enough.
4,"Highly melodramatic, but good nonetheless.","I'll admit that I'm biased--I like any book dealing with dragons. That goes double for one by an author who can write on the telepathic dragon/human link subject without sounding like a two-bit parody of Anne McCaffrey. And Shirley Rousseau Murphy has succeeded. My one complaint was the melodramatic nature of the characters-- the villains had no redeeming qualities, the heroes had very few faults. This detracted somewhat from the storyline of all three books in the trilogy."
2,"Mediocre explanations, poorly proofread.","If you're searching for a CCNA study guide, I'd advise looking elsewhere. While reading, I've noticed many typographical errors, poor editing, and in one case, an entire paragraph repeated for no apparent reason... and I'm only up to chapter five.Many of the explanations are difficult to understand at best. I frequently find myself searching other resources while trying to make sense of the incomplete and often confusing material.If you must get this guide, wait for the sixth edition. Hopefully, it will have gone through a more thorough proofing process."
3,Not alone,"Clear book, and good exercises too which help better understand the concepts.In any case to pass the exam you need for some subjects a more detailed guide (such as ICND books), though less well structured.Good to go but not alone."
5,Good Stuff,I was not sure if I could get belts for my sander with this dimension any more. The belts are inexpensive and work great. They were at my house a few days after I ordered them.
2,"ok, but not great","The book was easy to read, but in the profession, I found that it was outdated and sometimes bordering on incorrect. I personally would recommend another mortuary textbook to a student or school."
2,Disappointed,"I am a PA licensed Funeral Director/Embalmer. I studied at NCACC. Most of my embalming training was through hands on experience, the rest through Xerox copies of outdated texts. Also, there was the 1st edition of this book. I only found it useful to study the history section. This new version has not improved at all. This book covers the legal requirements and BORES you to ""death"", but it is not very practicle for embalming techniques. The title is very misleading. The Theory & Practice Sections you can rip out of the book. I reiterate: This book is only good for the History of Embalming (& perhaps some of the federal requirements too). If you want a good embalming text, ask your local funeral director to Xerox his old embalming book for you --just make sure It's not by Mayer!"
5,A real singer singing real songs,"Shortly after buying this album, I saw Mandy at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. The stage was bare, with only an upright piano, a microphone stand, and a wooden chair. He came onstage barefoot, wearing black slacks and a white T-shirt, accompanied by Paul Ford, his pianist. No orchestra, no light show, no set, no distractions. For the next two hours, he raised the roof on the joint. Talk about working on a high wire without a net! In that setting, there is no place to hide; either you have the talent and show it or you don't. Not many of today's ""entertainers"" would have the guts to venture into that arena. It was an astonishing performance, as is this album. This is on my Top Ten list of CDs everyone should own."
1,DON'T BUT THIS!!!,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!! The backing paper rips and does not come off easily. The laminated part wrinkles and puckers. I was ripped off BIG TIME!!!!
1,The backing doesn't come off!,"I have used lots of clear contact paper in the past, but I have never had the paper backing be so difficult to remove! It was difficult to even remove 2-3 inches without the paper ripping and separating into layers--leaving an impossible-to-remove thin layer of paper on the adhesive. I am sooo disappointed! This is acting like a really old roll of masking tape. I spent way too much for a huge roll of useless contact paper!"
2,"I agree with ""The backing doesn't come off!""",The backing is very difficult to remove. The quality of the pouch is not really good. I can't even success one good picture laminate (with a lot of spend time). It's very hard to laminate anything large because it always happen to get rip when you separate the backing.
1,Terrible! And defective!,"This roll arrived back in January so it is past the return time frame. I just now went to use it, and the laminating material will not pull off of the paper backing! It is defective! I highly suggest to not purchase this product! It seems like a great price, but I can't even use this at all. If I could give it 0 stars I would!"
2,"If you like Holmes or Brown, get something different...","Night Watch presents Holmes in a slightly different setting, but unfortunately, it is only looking at how he uses unusual bits of info and the bit of theological interplay that makes the book truly interesting. For fans of Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown, I recommend getting a different book....."
4,Read as a kid and still great as an adult,I read this book back in middle school and had a craving to read it as an adult. I found it here on amazon and loved all the stories in it. A few of course are better than others but the main title story is a great short read that was worth the price of the book itself.
4,Color is weird,"Protects sheets well, and is pretty durable and cheap. However, mine were of a strange dull white/yellow combo color, which was kind of weird. For reference, product made in china."
4,Pretty good for everyday use,"I've purchased 2 of these sheet protector boxes and plan on ordering a 3rd one real soon. They aren't the ""top of the line"" sheet protector, but they work great for everyday use. Sheet protectors can be really pricey so if you need a lot of them, just to keep papers organized for example, then these work really well. I'm keeping a lot of my daughter's school work in these. It's nice to flip through them and quickly glance at her work in an organized way."
4,Worth the price,For $10 you can't go wrong with 100 sheet protectors. My only qualm was that instead of them being that nice clear plastic it was the sort of frosty tinted one. You still see the pages but there is a huge difference when you compare it to the clear ones.
3,Half of the box was damaged,"It does not occur often with amazon.com, but this product was damaged during shipping.The part of it I salvaged works fine."
4,"Great Cord, Little short","As with most things on amazon, they seem to be too good to be true and most products will have their shortcomings which becomes apparent the second you open the package. For the case of this cord, its shortcomings was the fact that it was just a bit short for my taste. The one that came with the GameCube was a good 1-2 feet longer."
4,my review,"I have already read many books from this author, and I have enjoyed each and every one. This was no exception.This book is very entertaining and the plot keeps us hooked until the very end. The characters are alive and well liked or disliked, in Ruth's case."
1,Was a great machine....while it worked,"I got a DVR90VF for christmas, and was eager to transfer many home movies onto DVD. I went through about 40 DVD sessions without error. But then , only 3 weeks into ownership, I tried to record a movie off of TV. When we went to play it back, It was full of pauses, skips, blips and blurps making the movie unwatchable.I have since tried to load store bought DVD's, new blank DVD's, and the blacks I have recorded on and get the same warning 'please eject disc......playback feature may not be available on this disc'. NOTHING will load. I tried resetting the unit, and have done many other things. but the fact is, it went from working to not working instantly and has not worked since. The unit was 3 weeks old, brand new from sears on puchase.Inquirey to sylvania got me an automated response to go to some company calll funai, who has since given me a run around. I fell completely helpless and ripped off."
4,Good for one tight for two,"Material used is so so , i think not upto the mark as i expected from Caselogic. Still better than rest generic seller. For this price it is good value for money"
2,Too small for use,This is reviewing the 2 capacity shuttle...Too small for rubber enclosed drives. Wouldn't have bothered if I'd known how limited the space was for these. Inside storage area is cheaply made as well. Wouldn't expect to hold up well to frequent use even with sufficiently small drives.Don't bother purchasing if you use Corsair or Patriot drives. Can't speak for other drives.
4,Just What I Needed,This case is just what I needed to store my USB drives. I have damaged and misplaced several in the past.
5,Just what I needed,Love the little hook thingy that allows me to hook it onto my purse. Holds 2 thumb drives. Perfect for me.
2,Ok but could be better.,"This shuttle is o.k. at best. The inner sleeve that holds the drive in place is made of very thin plastic that seems to want to tear at any moment. Furthermore, there could be more padding; there isn't much of it and I feel that the drive isn't well protected. I think I will shop around for a replacement.Case Logic JDS-2 USB Drive Shuttle 2-Capacity (Purple)"
3,"Ok product, slight design flaw","Product is what it is. There is plenty of room that the manufacturer could have utilized to add another flap for storage, but they missed that boat. It's a bit large of case for only 6 sticks."
3,confundida,"No recivi lo que crei pedir lo que me enviaron fue la memoria no lo que se ve, crei que era el estuche"
5,excellent quality,order today - you will not be disappointed - order today!!!! I had been looking for a small case for my flash drives and am delighted!
