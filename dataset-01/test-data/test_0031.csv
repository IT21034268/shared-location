2,not happy,"i had seen this movie years ago and loved it, but this cd was terrible. it stopped every few minutes. i feel i'm owed a new one. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,"What the hell, another five stars can't hurt!",The thing I really love about Kate Bush's music is the imagery she creates with her songs. Her singing and musicianship are inventive and brilliant. What else can I say that hasn't been said...buy this CD it's one of her best.
5,Basically flawless and deservedly influential,"I didn't listen to this record when it came out.... but as the 80's recede into the distance the real peaks of the decade rear up, and this is one of them. Tori Amos et al. are of course unthinkable without this record, but I hear traces of this record throughout a lot of rock (especially down the Muse/Radiohead/Nigel Godrich end of the spectrum, but, hello? Antony and the Johnsons - I swear, Kate and this album in particular are everywhere!). Bush just *is* in a very sweet spot here - prog. rock studio and musical virtuosity, singer-songwriter confessional intensity, and a bit of Brian Wilson pop smarts saving it all from being unbearable. Pointless going through all the songs - individually they're all v. good to great, but taken together they're magic. A seriously powerful record."
3,Avoid The Audio Fidelity vinyl,"If you have the original vinyl of Hounds of Love, you are all set. The Audio Fidelity version has a touch and I mean ""just a touch"" of fuller bass at the expense of clarity and definition. The older (colored vinyl)version has more snap and the backing vocals, keyboards and cymbals are more easily heard; creating a much higher resolution effect. This new vinyl remaster tries to soften everything to the point of exclusion of the instruments. The Audio Fidelity pressing is known for its defects on side 2 and I can tell you its is made without sufficient quality control. If you are looking for an ornament than buy it, but if you want the complete Kate Bush experience, buy the old version."
3,beware the red & black!,"These colors work pretty well, although they are not quite as vibrant as another brand gel color that I have. What IS very disappointing is the taste! There shouldn't be any taste, and it's very noticeable in both the red and the black. I'll be buying a different brand from now on."
2,Low quality product,"My nephew really loved, but I was a little surprised with the quality versus the price."
2,"Um, it's a robe","The picture shows a lot more, but in the end, it's a robe. Nothing more. No belt, no pants, no shirt, no light saber, no boots, it's just a robe. For what you get, it's over priced. Easy to miss based on how it's advertised.Joel"
4,enduring band,"a fun-loving and frolicsome journey through the creativity and determination of a truly unique band.If you can get past the silly fashions and very casual format of this video, you can peer into the heart of two women who stuck to their guns and forged ahead into true mastery of an enjoyable and enduring niche within the fickle music industry."
3,Live at the concert,Nice video with semi-amatuer camera shots. Suprise appearance from Michael Stipe (REM) for Kid Fears. Has bits of personal interviews. This video shows The Girls in an intimate light.
3,"Full of talent, empty of inspiration","It is unheard of to pick up any Bowie album and not hear at least one tune that sticks in your head. Except for Heathen. It's as though DB wanted to write an entire album of background dinner music. The first track hints at something greater within, but by the end you wonder how long you were asleep. This is NOT a ""return to traditional Bowie"". This has none of the passion, flair, or life of his past albums. The young DB had a raging fire within him, but Heathen is a smoldering, grey collection of dead songs.***If you have accidentally listened to this album and have lost all hope for the future, I suggest you refresh yourself with ""Five Years"", ""I'm Deranged"", and ""Wild is the Wind"" in that order."
5,bowie has reached new heights,"Heathen is something that needs to be played again and again and again. The music, lyrics, and ""guest"" musicians are perfectly written and chosen. The best is the second cd with the Moby remixes. Get this now."
5,Very Good!!!,"I was at the record store the other day and decided to finally get A bowie cd.I wanted to get ""outside"" but they did not have it, so I got ""Heathen"" instead.And for being my first bowie album i was not let down.Every song is good and well worth the purchase.It won't really matter what genre of music you like,this is some good stuff,and highly recommended!"
4,"The old style, refined","With Heathen, Bowie brings a knowing, polished maturity to his late 60's to mid 70's style. At this point, his subtle sophistication has become quite powerful. Of course, with his maturity, we will find a lack of driving energy or flamboyant risk taking. This is a mature rocker showing why he's a master. This album will get zero airplay on commercial radio. But for dedicated Bowie fans, many of whom are almost as old as Bowie, I think most will feel Bowie has reached his pinnacle with this album."
3,Good latter day Bowie,"This album does not equal the Bowie albums from the 70s but is better than most of his 80's and 90's output. The music displays an energy and enthusiasm that has been missing for quite some time. I particularly like the 3 cover songs on the album - Cactus, I've been waiting for you, and I took a trip on the Gemini Spacecraft. The last is a cover of a song by the Legendary Stardust Cowboy. BTW the lyrics of the last cover are very similar to the Frank Sinatra song ""I Thought About You"".The original songs on the album don't work that much for me except for ""Slow Burn"", ""Sunday"" and ""I Would be Your Slave"".Worth it for people who are more than casual Bowie fans otherwise start with the older Bowie albums."
4,8.5/10 Buy this (if your a bowie fan),"When you first listen to Heathen you might think hey, this isn't too bad but there is a better future after you give it a few listens. When I first bought this one I gave it about five listens in the first few days but when I gave it a two week break I then listened to it again and appreciated it alot more.This album definetly has a great dark, mysterious element to it and it's a very good buy. My favourite tracks are Sunday, Slip Away, Be your slave...... actually I like all the tracks and you will too."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I preordered this book based on its advance publicity. It was a major disappointment. Written in the style of an extended ""People Magazine"" article, it would have been better titled simply ""Bob abd Louis.""It's reasonably well written, albeit in a breezy style, but you'll learn nothing more about Bob Hanssen, his character, or his motivations than you already know if you followed the news coverage of his arrest and conviction. You'll know more about Louis Freeh than you did before but most of it is ""file and forget"" trivia.The author started out I think to write a definitive account of Hanssen's extended espionage but soon found out he didn't have enough material for a full book so he went to his word processor, dragged up his notes for a book about Freeh (a project which I suspect he had abandoned when Freeh's career went in the tank), and merged then together into a one book.I felt I wasted my money buying it and, more importantly, my time reading it."
4,Very well written,"I personally enjoyed this book. Why did I enjoy it? Here's why-1. It provides a very provacative way to look at the inside of an outsider.2. We can all relate to it one way or another (even though we are ashamed to admit it).3. You get to see to men fighting their own battles but it a similar way.The reason I docked it down a star is because the author could have gone into more in depth descriptions on somethings but at the same time not could have been as descriptive on other topics (especially the sexual related areas)In Conclusion, If you enjoy a spy/biographical account of one of the most notorious spies ever recorded, this is the way to go."
2,You would do better to read the newspaper,"I thought the book was pretty poor. Not much in facts of what happened. I think I would have been better off to read newspaper articles written about the ""mole"""
1,X Rated,The dust jacket should carry a XXX rating. The inclusion of Hansen's sex fantasies render this book worthless. They don't contribute to understanding Hansen's motivation to spy. Instead Vise takes pleasure in vilifying Hansen's family and friends who don't deserve this treatment. Robert Hansen is the traitor.The parallel bio of Louis Freeh is a distraction.
1,a rush job,"I heard the author, David Vise, being interviewed on the radio (on the PBS program ""Fresh Air"") and found him very interesting. Unfortunately, the book is a big disappointment. It's a rush job and a pastiche, without much new information. The chapters on Louis Freeh are a complete waste. They were presumably thrown in to give the book some ""structure,"" but really have nothing to do with the Hanssen case and tell you nothing you wouldn't know from any press digest or encyclopedia yearbook. I am hooked on the Hanssen case, so I guess I would have read the book no mater what, but this book is a dud. It tells you little and is not particularly well written or researched. Plus, there's a lot of padding (e.g., chapter on Freeh)."
2,Read a better book,"This book doesn't compare with David Wise's book ""Spy, The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America."" There seems to be a lot of assumptions and conjecture's in the Vise book. Wise has much better sources."
2,Not good,"There are maybe 40 or 50 interesting pages in this book...70 if you like porn. David Vise really didn't have enough material to write a book about the topic, so he filled the rest with an inconsistent bio of former FBI Director Louis Freeh and some weak psychological explanations of why Bob Hanssen did what he did.What is most disappointing is that it reads like a series of newspaper articles and not like a book. Vise really doesn't tie the story together well and he has no point to make.Finally, a minor beef -- the whole 'Because he ratted out KGB moles who were later tried and executed, he committed the equivalent of mass murder...' line is BS. Those guys betrayed their country too. Just because it was a different country doesn't make their treason excusable."
5,Handy map,I am in real estate and I'm always needing a good map to help me find a property. I showed this one to my husband when I received and he wanted it to keep in his truck! It is very handy and definitely easy to put away.
5,First rate.,"This is the one that works best for me.Heppner is fine. Freer of spirit than with Solti. I prefer Studer here. I'm not a huge fan of the lady, but here she does a wonderful job. Weikl has the role well in hand. He's in good voice. The rest of the cast falls into place nicely.The recorded sound is very natural. The orchestra is, well, how many hundreds of times do you suppose they've played this music? They just simply know it.And Sawallisch is joyous. No superstar conductor here. This is a man who clearly understands Wagner is the star. He understands the score.I love this recording.Until someone ""discovers"" the greatest young heldentenor of his generation, Robert Dean Smith, and puts him in front of a microphone with a great conductor and orchestra to immortalize the greatest Walther (and Lohengrin and Parsifal and Siegmund) alive, this will do quite nicely."
2,Unwatchable.,"Despite a sumptuous production (reminiscent of 1930s Hollywood in many ways), I found this ""Boheme"" pretty much DOA from the first note. There is such a profound disconnect between the singers actions and their voices that I found it unwatchable. Did the singers lip-synch to a previously recorded track? Or did they dub the vocals after having shot the film? Either way, it makes for a very odd viewing experience. I can't even comment on the quality of the performances, as the soundtrack sounds as if it were recorded in a barrel, hollow and distant. You'll be far better off watching any of the marvelous Metropolitan Opera productions or the Covent Garden Cotrubas/Shicoff version. Even Baz Lehrman's updated, somewhat funky Australian Opera production is more true to the spirit of the piece than is this. And at least they're all LIVE."
4,Not as basic as I wanted.,"This manual assumes that you have some expertise and experience on diesel engines alresdy. I wanted a book that would give me some basics about this engine that were not clear in the owner's manual, which is quite lame."
1,zzzzzzzz,Enjoy james Franco as an actor but this one is a real turkey.Tries so hard to be an art movie noir but they forgot to have a plot that makes even a little bit of sense.Pretty well completely stupid with charactors who defy logic.Here's hoping the director gets into a line of work more suitable for his talents.
4,Good for the price,"If I were in the dog-food dispenser business I would make mine a bit sturdier, have an option for top opening R or L, a larger translucent or clear bar to see remaining amount of food and a measured amount delivered per handle-lift.But for this price it seems to do the job. Installation was pretty easy but I didn't find the drill template until I was done- it's printed on the box itself."
4,Was Slavery the Cause of the Civil War?,"It is interesting that this question still causes such a high level of bitter disagreement. This question has been argued in a thousand different ways. Cooper's work, in my opinion, provides the answer. He convincingly shows that Southern politics turned on the issue of slavery not just after 1850, but all the way back to 1831. Slavery and Southern safety won and lost the big elections after 1831 in every Southern state. The issues differed (states' rights, western expansion, etc.), but the heart of every issue was what it would do to slavery. It's hard to find, but if you can, read it."
3,Good But Leaves Residue,This product gewets the floor clean but leaves a residue film if not buffed dry. Actually I have tried 5 different wood floor claners and this one leaves the least residue but they all need to be buffed dry with a towel not to leave a residue
5,No Disappointment,"This is one of the best compilation CD's I've seen representing the 80's techno pop genre. There are 3 CD's, each about 70 minutes long. Most of the songs are in their complete 12"" extended form. Included are some of the most danced songs from the clubs of the 80's. Songs like: ""Blue Monday"", ""Smalltown Boy"", ""Relax"" brought techno pop to the forefront of dance music. There are a lot of songs that are difficult to find like the seductive, ""Outside Looking In"", by Dream Sequence and ""The Night"", by Azul Y Negro. Personal bests of the collection are the songs by: B. Movie, Belouis Some, Cabaret Voltaire, and Spandau Ballet (a beautiful, powerful dance ballad!!) If you enjoyed the music of the early to mid 80's with an emphasis on dance then this this the perfect 3 CD compilation. Also in the collection is the ""I Love Disco"" available in Volumes 1,2, and 3. Each volume contains 3 CD's each."
5,I Respect Rosa Parks but this song is tight,I respect Rosa Parks&her Position on this song but this song is a jam no matter how you break it down.i couldn't put it down.very catchy but timely lyrics.i dug the whole break down of it.worth checking into.
2,"DON""T!!","I remember distinctly the day I bought 'The Fragile', taking it home on a Sunday afternoon, closing the curtains & dialling it right up - and getting totally blown away...Today's experience was the exact opposite. The songs don't 'bite' like the ones on PHM/Broken/Spiral/Fragile, there's no sense of menace like the earlier stuff...Seeing the video for 'The Hand that Feeds' I thought, allright, okay song, maybe the rest of the album will be better...Sadly not, don't bother with this, just stay at home, put on the DVD of 'And all that could have been' really loud and remember Nine Inch Nails as we love them... {sob}P.S. If you want something to really rock your world try 'Cale:Drew' by Jakob - now there's an album!!"
5,"A little of the newer, a little of the older: Seminal NIN","This one grows on you... take more than one listen, the last 2 tracks are superb, track one sets a great tone.Great NIN release."
1,Big gigantic let down,"It has been six years since Trent has released a disc, and this it the best he can do?This may be just as dark as Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral, but it lacks spirit, it lacks enthusiasm, it lacks...teeth.The best songs on the disc would make really great Garbage tunes, or material for an awesome Smashing Pumpkins reunion, but for NIN it's just boring.Next time when you take six years off Trent, catch up with modern times. My Chemical Romance, Spalding Rockwell and The Used are putting out much better discs, and you can guarantee they aren't going to wait six ####ing years to put out another one."
4,Great Cd could of been better,"Hey i just bought with teeth and the dual disc at the same time. I have every NIN cd so i do collect I think this cd is a great one but it still will never come close to Trents old work. Also I believe for the time spent on it, it could have been alot better (as in more songs possibly)"
1,What a shame,"Ugh, I don't know what to say other than ""What happened to NIN?"" If you're anything like me, you'll be sorely disappointed by this album. If you're a big fan of pop tracks mixed in with a bunch of ""brutal"" underproduced songs then maybe you'll like it... a bit."
2,i waited 6 years for this?,"First off, I am (was?) a serious NIN fan, owning all the prior haloes. I thought the Fragile was the best album Trent ever did. With Teeth, on the other hand, has no bite. I get the feeling he slapped this together in under a year. The deep full instrumentation from his last release is gone, none of the songs grab you or even wake you up. The last track is probably the only one I liked. I really hope it will grow on me, but after 3 listens I wish I hadn't spent money to hear the downfall of one of the great bands of my youth. Yuck."
2,boring.....,"If you don't care about the fact that there is nothing new on this album then it's ok. OK.There is nothing new on this album at all. He says nothing new at all. There's nothing new to the music.Yes, I got it when I was 15, but come on Trent, grow up. He's going to be 40 this month and he's still writing high school poetry lyrics.We all feel really sorry for you trent."
2,I didn't like it at all,"I'm a big NIN fan, I have all of their albums except this one. Since I listened to the single ""The Hand that Feeds"", I was surprised at how trendy it sounded; still I was hoping the album would offer something interesting. Sometimes musicians should be honest with themselves, after awhile you simply have nothing more to express, and this happens in any kind of art."
5,the return... but hopefully to the prolific persona...,"Another album that took 5 years to become a tumor in my cd player. The sound of this album is totally raw and powerful. The addition of live drums is intense. I will admit that trent hasnt really ascended to any level he wasn't previously at, but at least he didn't sell out into some ballad rock format. The IDIOTS who question an electronic 4/4 based beat as 'disco' need to stop listening to electronic music all together and just stick to AOR and Producer/Label created bands. Industrial music began as a 4/4 throb with layers of any device that would add to the collage of sound... Recreation of society in collapse perhaps... just maybe."
4,"Not Reznors Mona Lisa, but still great!","Downward Spiral is and always will be my favorite NIN album, maybe for reasons of nostalgia or maybe because nothing can top it. That said, With Teeth is an excellently executed and equally disturbing view into the mind of Trent Reznor and his demons. Love it."
2,IT'S ALL IN THE STARS,"good side:finally a new NIN album, Dave Grohl appears on several songs playing drums, Trent's voice sounds its bestbad side:the entire packaging, the line-up change, lyrical contentstandout tracks:all the love in the world; the hand that feeds; every day is exactly the same; right where it belongs"
2,"get back, get back to where you started from","This seems an attempt to regain lost popularity, from ambitious though boring conceptual one man efforts.NIN started out as bouncy gothic disco, and this is the best part of this album.Only fits this bill, the best track. It could have been made by NIN in 1995, or The The in 1985- the lyrics are even straight from Soul Mining.It sounds more like a band than a man in a studio, and this is good. Broken and some other cuts always sounded stagnant from the studio, whereas live versions or studio performances were better (a video Broken is the band in a one take, much better than the album track)."
3,Check out allmusic for further reviews,"As allmusic states (and I agree to some stature), this record is quite good if your a big NIN fan. Other than that, it is just going to seem like dense material that you don't understand. Listening to the record it sounds like a hell bent man making and mixing music alone in his Louisiana home for five years. Which in some cases can be an amazing thing, but not when you rant on about being alone and pushing everything else away and going insane from soclusion. So, as I conclude my rant, this is a good cd. Good, not great, but quite good if you can sit down and listen for long periods of time. As The Fragile was, it takes a lot of indepth listening and breaking down to understand."
4,My 1st NIN album,"This is the first album I've ever purchased by Nine Inch Nails and I am very impressed. I'd downloaded the popular songs a couple of years ago, but after I heard ""The Hand That Feeds"" I was convinced I needed to get this album. I understand most fans compare this to the previous albums, but since I'm new to the band I only look at this as a album and songs I've heard before. There are some great hooks on this record and it's even cooler that Dave Grohl provided his sticks on a couple songs. ""Sunspots"" and ""The Line Begins To Blur"" are among my personal favorites. Overall I really like this album and will be likely to purchase another Nine Inch Nails album. Trent Reznor has a knack for creating some good stuff."
5,Incredible,"Spend the few extra dollars on the dualdisc version that has the album in 5.1 surround. It is definitely worth it. If you don't have a 5.1 surround system, go find someone that does have one because you are missing out listening to this album in stereo. There's nothing like having ""With Teeth"" surround you in five blazing channels."
5,NIN Back With Another Classic,"It's been five years, but the musical genius Trent Reznor returns with another masterpiece. Every song on this album is unbelievable, I can't even really pick a favorite. This is definately in my top 5 favorite cds. Get it. 5/5 stars."
5,a true masterpiece,great... in my view....simply greattracks like all the love in the world give it a new feel then all the other NIN albums i have heard and my fav track is definitely Every day is exactly the same. Just such pure emotion that is more clearly defined then all Trent's other albums
1,Worst NIN Album Imaginable,"Anyone who truly appreciates NIN for its brilliance and innovation will not like this album one bit. The lyrics are detestable, while the music is often lost and unnatractively dissonant. 'With Teeth' plays more like an industrial Staind album that Nine Inch Nails. Some of the songs on the album are so bad they just make me laugh, while the album as a whole is so cluttered it made me vomit on one occasion. 'With Teeth' has potential to be a mildly decent ablum, however, the lyrics read and sound as if they were written by a 16 year old boy, which Trent has regressed to in making the album."
3,Trent was better on drugs,"What can I say, big NIN fan, so hey I can't bash this CD and give it 1 or 2 stars like some other people. I agree with the reviewer who said he dosn't understand where the hatred for this album comes, because it's not a bad effort. However, I also agree with the reviewer that said that great art usually comes from pain, because now that Trent is sober there seems to be some of that old fire lacking from his sound. Some of these songs are a bit tedious are boring and i have to skip them. But don't get me wrong, the other half of the songs are really good... but I used to be able to listen to NIN all the way through. Now having to skip a few tracks made me decide to write this review and give this one 3 stars. Not bad, not great. Unless you're a big NIN fan you might want to think of picking up Pretty Hate Machine or the Downward Spiral instead."
4,another great album from this talented guy,well... NIN is all about Trent talent...still...another great album...that's no lie...another GREAT ALBUM!I don't hear lots of differences between this album and the others...still industrial and still dark....still GREATps: opens with a fantastic song
5,Who the hell writes the album reviews at Amazon............,"I just have to rant. It obvious that whomever listened to this album and then wrote the review has no musical sense nor knowledge, TEEN BEAT???? Overtly commercial rave-ups???? Dude or Dudette, Trent Reznor/NIN is classified only under one genre, and that is Industrial..I N D R U S T R I A L. And here is the ""TRICK"", Techno and any music pertaining to raves did not exist before Industrial music, Industrial had Techno beat by at least ten years. Using hard synth in music is an I N D U S T R I A L concept that techno and its cousins learned from the grand pappy of Synth, Industrial. SO before you critque, know what it is your critiquing, INDUSTRIAL. Got it now? (Or should I spell it out for you?)"
4,Beautiful,"She does some incredible things on this Cd, in spite of some problems with production values. Her song S.O.S. is amazing."
4,the product is good and the instruction is quite detailed,"The product so far works well on walls for small objects and I think if one follows the instruction, the hooks can work for longer. The instruction is detailed and quite user-friendly with two color-labels."
1,sticky but doesn't stick,"Wouldn't hold light weight picture or 1/4"" foamboard to newly painted walls. Maybe scrubbing wall with alcohol would work. Son did not know they were just purchased from Amazon and threw them in trash."
1,"If must use, use with care","If you have NO other choice and must use these, do NOT hang any thing of value. I have tried these hooks for everything from small plates to holiday decorations and have never had them hold. My best suggestion: never use for anything breakable unless you want to lose it."
1,fell right of the wall,"it didnt work for me, followed instructions exactly. I don't know why they didn't hold. Maybe too high humidity where i live. I'm glad I tried them for 80 cents from the clearance rack from Walmart."
4,Good When You Don't Want To Leave Marks,"Replaced my kitchen cabinets recently and did not want to damage them with nails. I bought these hooks at Lowe's. They are sized medium and won't support anything in excess of 3lbs. I needed a hook for my apron and a hook for my calendar. Followed the instruction with one deviation. I didn't hang anything from them until the adhesive cured for a couple of hours. I did this after one hook came down on another occasion and it seems to have resolved that problem. From past experience, uninstalling is simple.The main reason I like the Command system is that it doesn't leave marks or cause any damage. Tried similar items and they caused damage or left a sticky mess.My only gripe is that they are overpriced. I still have failed to find these bargain priced and I am a bargain shopper."
3,Good Hangers; Can Cause Injury,"These hangars work really well if used correctly. Can't find these particular hangars for a better price than on Amazon. Be careful with these hangers though, today I pulled off one of the strips (as directed) and it acted like a rubber band and smashed itself so hard against my finger it actually broke the finger nail. After some swearing and a bandaid for the bleeding I was able to put a new strip back on and move the hanger which works great still.Ultimately they're good hangers but you need to remember to be careful."
3,ok,"Held ok, but the shape makes it hard to use with a lot of things. It also tore off my drywall in my dorm."
1,"The strip does not adhere for more than an hour,","I've bought several of this kind of Command Damage-Free Hanging hooks. The latest one claims to hold up to 3 lb. I tried twice, followed the instructions carefully plus pressed for twice as long and waited for twice as long as well. Still the hook fell off by itself after half an hour, from an 4-oz piece of cloth.I'm through with this line of products and I think they should recall all their products if they run an ethical business."
5,"Armed to the ""Teeth"" with Info!","A great book for dental novices. Great, inspiring stories, lots of very useful information from dealing with sensitivity, to dealing with bad breath. A must buy for anyone prior to making the investment in to a smile makeover. I'm actually looking forward to my next dental visit!"
3,not entirely accurate,"FYI Dorfman owns Discus dental (Zoom whitening) which he repeatedly mentions in his book. He claims that the Zoom laser provides a 26 percent improvement for in office bleaching. This is entirely untrue. Numerous studies have shown that any laser (be it zoom, sapphire etc) does not have a substantial increase in the efficacy of bleaching. It was previously thought that the light would heat up the peroxide and the heated peroxide would have increased bleaching power. However the light has the side effect of heating up your teeth and increasing the likelyhood of sensitivity. In office bleaching is harsh enough and light only increases the sensitivity. Unless someone is strapped for time, I would suggest custom trays over in office. If you choose in office, I would stay away from the laser. Most of the statements in his book are accurate, however some (including this one and more) aren't entirely true. However, the average reader would never know it..."
5,Does the job,"This item was just what I was looking for. I still have the older pin connectors in my shower for alternative placing of the showerhead. This pin was the right size, inexpensive, yet durable. It does the job."
5,DORA ROOM-IN-A BOX,"THE DORA IN A BOX IS REALLY SOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTE AND VERY WELL MADE. HOWEVER, THE PUT TOGETHER DIRECTIONS ARE LESS THAN WONDERFUL -- IT TOOK OVER AN HOUR TO PUT THE BOOK SHELF TOGETHER AND 4 HOURS TO PUT THE BED TOGETHER ---------------WE ARE VERY ADEPT AT PUTTING TOGETHER CHILDREN'S TOYS ---- WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ----------------THE END RESULT IS WONDERFUL, HOWEVER, GETTING THERE IS NO LESS THAN TOTALLY FRUSTRATING!"
3,Book smelled bad,The book smelled of mildew when I received it. I wish I would have known that before buying.
2,Not what I expected,"It looks nice in the picture, however it is more of a ""trucker"" hat style, then a baseball cap style. It sits really tall, instead of form fitting to the head. The fabric was strange too. It wasn't like a normal hat, it was more of a velvet feel to it. So weird.Also, beware, they don't give refunds, only ""store credit""."
2,POOR QUALITY,Less than a year old the white is chipping off on one sneakers upper as if it were paint on plastic. Now the gum rubber is detsching from the side of the toe. Not ripped just coming unglued. Will not buy this brand again.
5,Great Pot!!,"Oh, this pressure cooker is just great. I love it. I recommend it to everyone who wants food cooked fast and just delicious!"
1,The most awful product I have ever purchased,It is so difficult to get the lid on and off it is just not worth the aggravation. I would not recommended this product.
1,It's a fountain!,"Got this cooker reading all the nice reviews, but this was a big disappointment.I did use Hawkins before, but this cooker spits out water(mixed with whatever you are cooking) like a fountain.I tried cooking with less water, less heat etc. only to clean up after every time I used this. That's probably because it doesn't have a traditional whistle."
4,Perfect size for solo cooking.,"It's a perfect size for singles. I can cook brown rice and soaked dried beans in the same time I could cook white rice. I may try the two together. I won't cook acidic foods it it. It's aluminum. Otherwise, I'd give it five stars.Hawkins Pressure Cooker, 1.5 LITER"
2,the lid,"I am only 60 years old and in good health, but I found it impossible to get the lid on correctly. Of my 3 grown sons, 2 could get the lid on and 1 could not. I gave it to one of the sons who could get the lid on and who likes to cook. I am normally pretty dexterious. I just couldn't do it. I guess I will go to BB& Beyond and select one in person and not purchase until I see if I can ""handle"" it. The instructions for the lid were though, but it didn't help."
5,Vivaldi At It`s Best,"The artistry of Parkening has never been better.His interpretation and presentation is what one would expect from this virtuoso.If its relaxation or background music to dining, this recording is a must.Faithfully,Clive Thomas."
5,Awesome!,"Love these pants! I wear a 10/12 in a jean. Ordered a large and they a slightly baggy, just the way I like it. I am only 5' 1"" and the adjustable drawstring ankle works great for me! Subdued colors, lots of pockets and sits below the waist. Nothing negative to say!"
5,Great!,"OMG !!! I love all the pockets and do order a size smaller then what you would normally wear, that is a very good tip that I got from the other comments and they are so right..... I will so order these pants again I love them..."
2,review paratrooper cargo pants,"love the color, arrived promptly, but they are literally swimming on me. Very large fit for a small and I didn't receive any packing materials/paperwork that would allow me to return them. So...stuck with a huge pair of pants I will donate as I cannot wear them."
2,Big and messy,"I bought this for my outdoor semi-feral cat. It is super wide and deep, not good for small dogs or cats. I modified it the best I could for smaller dishes to fit inside, but it is not easy to work with being so deep. The moat is very deep and wide so food gets dropped in it all the time which causes a mess, odor and bacterial issues. I have also noticed that this bowl creates a ""shelter"" of sorts for crickets and other critters to live underneath it. It does keep the ants out, but could be so much better. The open moat design causes a lot of problems. This would be okay for a large pet that doesn't make a mess when eating -- sticks their head in and doesn't come back out until they are done. Shopping for a different design, won't be using this one anymore."
3,"great idea, minor problem","Like many other reviewers, I found this food dish to be alarmingly large even for my 20 lb rag doll cat. He took to it very quickly and after a week, we have no ants in the food. I have already emailed the manufacturer to suggest a smaller size. The feeder comes with approx. 6x6 inch bowls and are great for a dog but for cats could be more like 3x3 or 4x4 and take up less room. After 3 months, the ants have found the weak link in this product-- the injection hole at the center of the product in the middle of the divider between the bowls is open and the ants come under the bowls and up through the hole to FEAST on the cat food. the solution is to seal the hole---tape, silicone sealer, hot glue--a screw, but SEAL the hole. UPDATE Now two months later, the cat food is safe 24/7 outside. I put a small screw in the offending hole and if I keep water in the moat, the ants can only get the kibble the cat or the birds leave outside the bowl."
2,Very Dissapointing,"Disapointing, but does show promise.If this book is anything to go by, Caitlin really should stick to writing 'The Dreaming' for DC."
3,Good imagery / No point,"As I was reading this book I was thinking: this girl can really write great descriptions. Unfortunately, as I kept reading I found that's about all she's good at. The characters are interesting, but ultimately, unconvincing. When Spyder beasts start killing people off, the only rationale I could find is that their sender, is named Spyder, and she has a fascination with spiders. This fascination has something to do with childhood abuse, but why it led to spiders is not clear. Perhaps that's something explained at the end of the book; I never got that far. Life is too short to finish poorly conceived novels, and, if the only reason to finish a book is to find out the reason for a plot device, it's not a good reason."
2,"pretentious, anyone?","The horrible looking cover should have warned me with the dream catcher - but I still thought this would be a great book, I'm a big fan of Poppy Z Brite and everyone said this author would be along the same vein. Well, this book was pretty bad; she can write somewhat, but she tried to jam too many references to random bands and such in. the premise was a little tired, too, why have the goth-y stereotype of spiders? Why not something decidedly un-gothy, like a rabid gerbil? Anyway, besides lack of creativity, clichéd drug use, and pretentious references (PJ Harvey? I'm enlightened, but most people would probably not realize what a complete goddess she is), it's got *some* promise."
4,Superb Uber Goth Counterculture Stuff,"'Silk' is definitely shades of Poppy Z. Brite...but I don't consider that to be a negative trait, and Caitlin obviously has her own uniqueness. This book is a contemporary southern gothic counterculture erotic psychological thriller extraordinare. I know this genre has it's critics, and people think the 'GenX Misfit Kids in Black' theme is overdone,I still love each new spin on it...and 'Silk' is a book that's very easy to relate to."
5,"MOODY, DARK NOVEL WITH THE FINAL HOPE OF REDEMPTION","A winner. I hate to make comparisons, but it's on par with Poppy Brite's best (another one of my fave writers). Surreal yet strong plot line, characters so real they hurt... check this novel out (and check out Caitlin's THE DREAMING Vertigo comics, and her short stories, too)!"
5,Beautiful,"I thought Kiernan's characterization was top notch. Everything was incredibly real, from the peyote to the music. For instance, I dont think there was one band in that book i dont have in my cd collection...it was just so real. Easy to identify with and beautifully written."
4,Wonderful,This is a must see for any CKY fan. (...) I saw this movie in the theater and it was even funnier when the audience is on the same wave length. Buy it and put it in your library.
1,Not Even worth the time it takes to type this.,"I would write a review if this movie had one reason for writing one, Since it doesn't the only thing i can say is your wasting your time even reading reviews about this movie let alone watching it. So Unless your pre-adult and trying to shock your parents and or impress your friends save your cash. This Movie isn't even worth the one star i gave it however i'm not sure you can give a movie no stars. I'd give it 5 stars if they'd take it out of print and burn the master tape :)"
4,"Dated, but quite sexy","Let's face it, this is a gay soft core porn flick. These guys are cute, nude, a great deal of the time, and are fixated on their anuses. Rip Taylor's cameo at the film's end is the clincher."
1,"Great movie, dumb edition","This movie is one of my absolute favorites! If you liked the show, you'll love the movie. Although, this edition of the DVD kinda' sucks. All Paramount did was take the deleted scenes from the original release and add them into the actual for this cut and of course, throw a teaser trailer for Jackass Number Two on there. If you already own the first edition DVD like most of us, skip this one."
1,SUCKED!,"This movie sucks for 98% of it's duration. Party Boy Chris Pontius is the only guy that made me laugh for a second. Everybody else's antics just made me sick, and I did not know if I wanted to kick their ass for it or throw up!"
5,The greatest film of all time,This is a great movie. A movie that shows you everything you wanted to see in a comedy. Dick and Fart jokes rule! See this film because it rocks. Give it a chance and you'll love it. Trust me:) lol
4,Yeah...,"Jackass is the kind of movie that you really shouldn't like. Every time I watch Steve-O jumping headfirst into a rotating ceiling fan, I know I really shouldn't be laughing. But the Jackass stunts (most of them) are just plain hilarious. The movie has no real plot line, just a bunch of insane, sometimes gross, stunts all strung together by the ten or so guys who pull them off. The Jackass bunch walk around Tokyo in panda costumes, hang off trees by their underwear, pole vault into trees and lakes, and give themselves papercuts. Among many, many other things. They are, quite simply, eight-year-old boys. But they're eight-year-old boys you love to laugh at. And the whole movie, they're laughing right along with themselves. If you like a good laugh and don't mind watching people hurl themselves into large objects and the like, I highly recommend Jackass. If you have a weak stomach for that sort of thing, don't go near it.The DVD has tons of great bonus footage, by the way. Check it out."
3,"Crude, but hilarious","Guess where a toy car ends up. (It also turns out to be the launch pad for a bottle rocket).If you are into puerile/scatological humor you won't be able to contain yourself. Yes I nearly collapsed onto the floor laughing, but once I regained my composure I was shaking my head..how could I possibly be laughing at this ?? And then I laughed some more."
2,Is This a War Movie or A Love Story??!,"Disapointing. I was looking forward to a good action movie, but most of the movie is a love story, and the movie only gets to D-Day at the very end. The title is misleading."
2,War movie?,"For the first five minutes I thought that this was going to be one of the best war movies I'd ever see, but then suddenly the movie back tracks to the years preceeding the D-Day invasion to document the love triangle that developed between a gorgeous woman and two of the officers in the commando unit. This lasts for much of the rest of the movie, with only five or ten minutes in the end consisting of a reasonably decent combat sequence. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of infidelity being masked as ""romance,"" which made the movie all the more annoying to watch. This should simply not be considered a ""war movie"" or a ""classic""."
1,An excellent theatre biography,"This summer I have been in an acting workshop. Two of the scenes I worked on were from Three Tall Women and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Working on Martha was an extremely difficult and challenging exercise, but fascinating. I became interested in Albee's background and read Mel Gussow's ""Edward Albee: A Singular Journey."" The book provides an excellent examination of Albee's life and the influences that informed his work. Reading this book helped me to better understand the character of Martha and the underlying themes of his plays. This book is not only a good read but also helps to reveal the playwright's motives, his drive and his creative sensibility."
2,Big Error on Page 379,In discussing Elaine Stritch he says she lost the Tony to Carol Burnett. Wrong! It was Zoe Caldwell who won. One wonders if he makes a mistake like this if there are a lot more errors. Check your facts man.
1,One foot in the grave,"This stilted recreation of a volatile and rich life is at odds with itself from the get-go. Albee, one of our greatest theatrical talents, deserves better. This attempt won't create interest in him for future generations. This is the sort of book that kills off spontaneity and learning."
3,a nice read with a wonderful hero,"This is the first book I've read by Gayle Callen and it won't be the last. I really enjoyed this book. The story starts off with the heroine being kidnapped and taken to a monastery. She has knowledge of a plot against King Richard. She is freed by a monk, the hero. He is actually a novice. He sees her being taken into the monastery and his knights training kicks in and he has to help her. Katherine is very leary of monks. She won't tell him her name and the real reason for her need to get to King Richard, but he helps her anyway. Along the way they discover they are attracted to each other and they end up making love. They know it is a sin but they can't help themselves. There are several twists and turns to this story. We soon find out that Katherine's monk is Reynold her betrothed's brother. I enjoyed this book and would like to see books about Reynold's brother and sister."
4,an odd mix,"music and odd trippy scenes with color makes me think juno, plus the untimely courtship in a screwed up situation thirsten and caroline have is alot like a darker not so bubbley likeness of paulie and juno. the darkness and creepy twists and turns- donnie darko. throw in a little ""lovely bones"" and some pot and you have Daydream Nationi really liked it.kat dennings was awesome, she is in everything, andie mcdowell did a great job as usual. Josh Lucas was perfect for the part but after Undertow that doesnt shock me. hes a great actor.its not a movie id wanta watch every day but i plan on making it part of my dvd collection. just like donnie darko, its perfect for those moods where you just wanta get drink a few brewskies and watch a dark movie. its not totally depressing like donnie darko was though. a few people die throughout it but well, theres a serial killer in it. but like i said, dark but not depressing."
3,ENDLESS MECHANICAL REPITITION,"John Adams' music is so endlessly repetitive I often wonder if something is wrong with my CD. No, it is just lazy, mechanical composition with little development."
4,Why 4 stars?,"First-off, this is a fantastic collection of some of John Adams's catchiest and creative works. But why 4 stars?1) Harmoneliere is great. But I think a more authentic recording could be that of Edo de Waart and San Francisco Symphony, since they premiered the piece, and Adams was composer-in-residence at the time. What this recording has that the other doesn't is the brassiness that the other recording could have.2) Short Ride was sort a let-down for me, but that's maybe because I have a recording that I think is more exciting. Marin Alsop and Bournemouth do a faster, louder, and punchier job, in my opinion.In conclusion, don't let this review stop you from buying it. I have it, and it's still fantastic."
1,Good try but...,It helps many people with motion sickness. It did not help me. Worth a try though.-Susan
4,"Does it work, does it now work? Can't tell if it is the placebo effect, but I did feel better.","I went on a cruise recently and I am subject to sea sickness. I put this on whenever I was feeling a bit sick. However, it was hard to tell if I was feeling better because the boat stopped rocking as much, or because of the Motioneaze. But who cares, I felt better. I would say that the bottle is pretty small, so if you use it a lot it will run out fast."
3,Does it work?,"I have used this on several occasions and honestly i don't know if it works. When i apply it though i feel slightly nauseated but it does not grt any worst than that. So in that regard it may actually be working, at least my nausea does not get too bad."
4,"KoRn is back with ""Untouchables""","KoRn's ""Untouchables"" is 15 tracks of rap/metal mayhem! I think KoRn fans will be able to appreciate this album alot more than their very disappointing last album, ""Issues"".""Here To Stay"" is already a big hit that you'll probably be hearing a lot of this summer. ""Hating"" is a hard-driven track that is sure to get your adrenaline pumping. My favorite song is ""Beat It Upright"", which is a wonderfuly clever joint!With Munkey and Head's guitar mastery, David's drums, Fieldy's brilliant bass playing, and Jon Davis's intense vocals; KoRn has once again put together a remarkable album. ""Untouchables"" is definitely worth buying."
2,Borrrrrrring!!!,"Not much of interest on this disc. Slicker production and vocal layering does not make for a more interesting listen. Past records sounded a lot fresher than this. I will admit though that I like tracks #1, #6, #7, #8, & #14 a lot but the rest can go elsewhere. It sounds like Korn is out of ideas especially Davis. Davis was a lame lyricist to begin with but to be singing about the same stuff 5 albums later is sad. I would have like to have seen a little growth out of these guys but I guess I'll have to be happy with the earlier albums."
4,Different,"I think the new Korn cd is very different from thier other Cd'sIts alot more calm, and its really good.Johnathan Davis expresses himself very deeply to certain issues.If i were you i would purchase this Cd.Wendy"
1,Loss of originality,"Korn use to have reasoning and feeling behind their music but now, after all the fame and fortune, how could they find their inspiration for music about hate and disgust? Untouchables wasn't made with any feeling, it was made because Korn knows that is the kind of music they are famous for. They're making money and having a good time and that's why they made this album yet this album is about hatred and evil, which doesn't make sense. No inspiration, no new material, no originality, the most disappointing album I bought in 2002."
2,Boring!,"This is korn worst album to date, it is simply boring, every song sounds the same.KoRns best album is ""Life is a peachy"", go get that instead if you dont have it yet (their 2nd album).The problem with this cd is, that after listening to it a couple of times, you allready wanna trhow it away, it's worn out really fast.... unlike their 1st and 2nd album... even ""follow the leader"" was better than this!.Buy the ""Ill NiNo - revolution/revolucion"" cd instead, or ""Killswitch engage - Alive Or Just Breathing""... you wont be dissapointed with those!"
3,Thank God its better than Issues.,This album really isnt all that.If It hadnt have been for Issues I probably would have gave this one 1 star.But its almost like you have to like it because of Issues.
2,what sick puppets Korn has become,"With their fifth release Korn moves further away from what made them great...the pure emotion of thier music and lyrics...davis's voice doesnt have the hard edge that he did in Korn and Life Is Peachy, they try to show they are the same band but fall way short, and even worse...they try to show how much theyve grown by having Davis actaully sing songs...something he should not do...i write this review not as someone who dislikes korn at all...in fact they were my favorite band for many years...if you want to hear GOOD Korn listen to Life is Peachy and Korn...and if you crave that emotion i highly recommend Daddy on Korn...if your favorite Korn album is Follow the Leader...go ahead and buy this album...if you arent one of the millions who joined korn after that album and heard them in the beginning...DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM...KORN IS DEAD"
5,The new Korn CD,"This new Korn cd is one of their best Cd's, in my opinion. There isnt a song on there that i dont like. if you have not heard this cd yet then i suggest that you go out and get this cd. there are some songs on there that just rock, wait all of them do. check it out. go get the cd. i promise you that you will not be disappointed."
4,untouchable?,"well, it didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it's still pretty good. ""here to stay"" is an incredible, awesome, massive-sounding song that hasn't budged from the top of my mp3 playlist for three months or however long it was since i first heard it. having only brought the album today, i haven't actually listened to the whole album, only up to track 8 (i don't remember what it's called, sorry!). you could call me stupid for reviewing it without having listened to the whole thing, but what i've heard is pretty good. ""bottled up inside"" sees the band returning to their original sound from the eponymoud debut, which is always a good thing.but in the end, ""untouchables"" isn't quite untouchable, but you'll have a hard time getting to it"
4,New but Old,"As soon as I heard the first single(Here to Stay)from KoRns new album I new it was going to be good, and I wasn't disapointed. This album is harder than both Follow the Leader and Issues, however their self-titled is still the hardest. This album has elements from all of their other albums but is different. The music feels like their first cd but the coruses feel like Issues. The emotion is gone from the songs, but that is no reason to not get this cd."
1,--------------------------------------,There is nothing good to say about this album. This horrible I used to like this band. Now they have sold out. All their new fans a posers trying to be hardcore. If you want to be hardcore listen to impaled. A real band that dosen't care about radio friendly-ness. If you like this [junk] you probaly watch mtv to much....
5,KoRn /Untouchables Album is pure raw emotion.,KoRn's new Album is one of the best i have heard this year from any upcoming and already released Albums.It's a mix of raw emotion and melodic tunes that will captivate you.Anyone who hasn't already gone and bought the cd should do so.It's worth it.Completely worth it.
1,don't touch untouchables,"it makes me sick to think that this album is getting stellar reviews. the singing is absolutly horrible i cant get over it. Jon blew out his voice back in 98 when follow the leader came out and hes been singing like a sissy ever since. If you can ""relate"" to this album because you get beat up or harrassed its because you listen to garbage like this. Wake up Hate is horrible, i really cant even grasp the reason why a decent band would put out garbage like this. This is all comming from an early fan who wants to kick everybody who loves this album...you have no musical taste at all. really, this isnt diverse or melodic, its horse dung.....nuff said."
5,One of their best,"I have been a fan since the first CD came out, and over the years Korn has changed their style quite a few times. The sound stays similar, but the music grows with each new release. The new sound is both heavy and mellow at the same time, and Jon Davis shows incredible range in his voice. A few songs on this CD come out as some of their heaviest stuff yet, while there are others that are easily their most melodious. Kudos to Korn for another great CD... Keep 'em coming!"
3,"Korn delivers what is expected of them, and nothing more","This album is nothing surprising. Korn have delivered a solid album which contains elements of all their previous albums. However, this album promises nothing new and has not made any major progressions such as the leap from Life is peachy to follow the leader(which was a major step forward for them at the time). Some feel that their self-titled debut was their masterpiece, for me that would have to be follow the leader which saw them at their most experimental and innovative. Despite that, this album is still sure to entertain and for some maybe even a little bit more."
5,a new side of KoRn,"This new album is great. It shows you every angle of this band. There are trademark heavy KoRn songs(Here To Stay, Thoughtlessness, Blame) as well as songs that I would say are probably KoRn's heaviest to date(Embrace, Wake Up Hate). But that's not all, this album also features some of the most beautiful, melodic vocals Jonathan has ever shown us on tracks like ""Hollow Life"" and ""I'm Hiding"". The music is amazing as well as the vocals, this shows the band at it's peak. Self titled and Issues fans alike will love this album, quite possibly KoRn's best yet."
4,"nu sound, still Korn!","Now, ive been listening to Korn since theyre debut ""Korn"" album. Ive been hooked ever since. Untouchables has a new sound, nonetheless, it has a hard hitting, Korn-like vibe to it. But, like most Korn fans, I was expecting something like ""Korn"" or ""Follow the Leader"". Yeah, I was surprised when I heard the digital stuff and the lower tones in the guitar/bass combos. But Korn has gotten their fans accustomed to new things throughout their last 4 albums. Either way, this is a great album that has Korn written all over it. Let's face it folks, JD cant scream and yell like the first one forever...and I think its a change leading to EVEN BIGGER and EVEN BETTER things. Fantastic album...without a doubt worth the measly pocket change for a nu, heavy sound from a great familiar band."
4,Korn ~ Untouchables,"I bought this CD about a month ago, this is certainly not Korns best ever CD but it still has a lot of quality to it. The best song on the album is the brilliant Here to stay, and Thoughtless is close behind, If you are new to korn the i wouldnt recommend this CD, the best Korn CD in my opinion is 'Follow the Leader' so I would recommend you buy that instead"
3,The new style for Korn.,"This is the new album by Korn. This band has many good albums, in my opinion this one is not as good as the others. For the most part this band has been most similar to Disturbed and Slipknot until now. Now I can't think of a baand to compare them to. All I know is thet this band changes constantly and not to judge this band by a single album.This album has a completely different style than their previous ones. The others where rock mostly. This one seems to be slightly more industrial. The CD is definately worth buying.One of the things on this CD I did not like was how much distortion was on the lead singers voice. I did like though, the fact that they sang most of their songs. with the new sound of the band the singing gives it a sureal type feeling."
5,Korn returns and rocks hard,"Korn's newest CD ""Untouchables"" is a lot better than their last release. ""Issues"" was a disappointment to me, an old school Korn fan. It was too soft. ""Untouchables"" is much different than any of their other albums, but it's not a bad thing. It still has the Korn edge. The music is as hard as ever. Davis's voice sounds great. There isn't as much growling from him but his singing is still excelent. Although it isn't as good as ""Korn"" or ""Life Is Peachy"" it is still very good. I think that it will appeal to most Korn fans and bring in some new ones."
1,"""Unlistenable"" is more like it","I was once a Korn fan. Their first album was one of the greatest hard rock albums ever. ""Life is Peachy"" and ""Follow the Leader"" were also very good. But something very bad has happened to them lately. The music, which once challeged the boundaries of what defined ""havy"" (yes, even on ""Issues""), has now turned into bad synth-goth, sort of like maybe what Orgy wanted to be. The lyrics, once angry and throaty, have finally delved into unintentional self-parody and are delivered in an annoying whine. This might be the single worst album I've ever spent money on. If you're new to Korn, get one of their first three albums. If you're an old fan, this is going to disappoint you greatly. You're better off downloading this one. I wish I had."
2,FAREWELL KORN...,"The change on the sound of KORN on Untouchables is absurd...The KORN formula is not very varieted, but albuns like LIFE IS PEACHY and KORN'S debut are raw and insane and got many good metal songs like BALL TONGUE, BLIND, DIVINE, SHOOTS AND LADDERS, LOST, ADIDAS and NO PLACE TO HIDE...On Untouchables, Korn puts a lot of eletronic textures and the music became much more depressing and sick, which i don't like at all... Besides the great opening track HERE TO STAY, i don't like any other song..."
1,"Thoughtless, yes indeed","Don't bother buying this rip-off. If you want a good Korn album, buy the only good one: the first one, self-entitled.Johnathan Davis clearly abuses from his winning formula, which made him so famous at the first place. I think Korn has to stop screaming like dogs, and start doing something that makes sense. As I said, please keep your money and buy the first one. It's really good. After that, they suck, except for some of the songs on Follow the Leader."
2,Korny??,"Korn are a band which is all over the music press. Highly respected and with a huge fan base. I though this album would be ok or at least good. But no. It is really not anything at all. There is two genres of song here.1. Very heavy intro, very chunky and difficult to make out.2. Synth intro, adding instruments, not very catchy just dull.All the songs within these genres sound the same. And are not really good at all.The most annoying thing about this album is the lyrics, Every single song Davies (korn singer) is constantly complaining about his ""hurt"". It gets really annoying, just shut up and get over it! It is really korny. (like this pun)"
2,NO,"to rate this album more than 2 stars... you would have to be a foolthe korn we all loved has been asphyxiated by an attempt at ""expensive"" production.If you could over produce an album, i think korn has done it...was that a guitar... or a computer?What the hell did jon davis just say?Where they real drums? they didnt sound like it!hahahahthis album is a joke"
1,Pure crap.,"Oh god, what happened to this band. This is a disaster.If you like some sick hybrid of pop mixed with death metal then you will simply ADORE this album. Don't forget whiny vocals and terrible, childish lyrics.If you like metal (good music), then buy Life is Peachy, Self-Titled, and yes, even Follow the Leader.STAY AWAY FROM ISSUES AND UNTOUCHABLES! ESPECIALLY UNTOUCHABLES!"
5,Masterpiece,"Since the release of the fourth album issues, i have long awaited KoRn's next album. The anticipation and the tension built up between my friends and i while talking about the album. Ever since last year around November time was the first time i heard a rumour of the new album, and got very excited. I searched the net for any info. on wen it was coming out. I finally found a website called Kornweb.com. This site was a big help to find out info. on it. The only annoying thing was was that the date wen it was coming kept on changing and changing. Finally the time came and i was exstatic. i was on the web trying to find a site to pre-order it and before i new it it was on my doorstep. I know all the lyrics of by heart and i think that it was worth the wait and that each of the songs is a masterpiece"
5,Kream of the Krop,"Untouchables is a work of art. The wait was deffinatly well worth it! With amazing tracks ""Here To Stay"", ""Thoughtless"", ""Hating"" and ""Beat It Upright"" just to name a few from this album was just what us Korn Kampers have been waiting for. I reccomend this to anyone who loves the sweet sounds of Korn. ""Hey Jon, Are You Ready To Rock?"""
5,The Best Yet.,"My humble opinion (being a loyal Korn Kid from day 1) is that this album is by far their best yet. It encompasses everything that is Korn. It's hard, edgy, and hauntingly melodic. To me the album feels and sounds like the Korn boys have grown up and matured musically, and it shines through in their most recent album, Untouchable. For all those who doubted Korn.. They're here and they're kicking a$$."
3,What is this stuff?,"I can not believe Korn has put this cd in stores. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Korn fan and love the other four cds, but this one is really, really, bad. There might be maybe four good tracks on it. If you are looking for a sound like there is on the first cd, this is not it. If any other band had put out this cd, I would have thrown it out the car window. Sorry to say it Korn, but you need a album that sounds like the first two to get back many fans that have left."
4,good enough,"this cd is good.it was the second CD i got by Korn.then i started to buy their older s**t.the DVD version of this CD is probably the one that i would reccomend, because it has more things that come with it.alot of good things come with it.i would reccomend this version to people who are thinkin of buyin this CD.The CD itself is very good and has a lot of thought put into it.""Thoughtless"" and ""Here To Stay"" and ""Alone I Break"" are probably the best songs.i like Korn alot.On this CD they have a bonus track. it is a remixed version of ""Here To Stay"".Its cool.and it has a cool a** beat.Korn is a kick a** band, buy every f**kin CD that they have made!!!!!"
4,Finally,"Finally the new album from Korn came... And when I listend to it, I got pretty surprised. Jonathan Davis shows a new way to perform his lyrics. The also call it the heaviest album ever, I would say it's not in the music, but in the lyrics its heavy. Korn shows a softer side of them, which I actually think is a great turn. You can almost say its the softer perspective that makes the whole album heavy.... Love it - and hope they visit Europe soon."
1,not one of there best,this cd sucks no afence 2 korn. i like there other cds like there debut and all of them except for untouchables.
2,The worst korn album!,"I was a huge korn fan until they released this album. Everyone of the songs is a disappointment. ""Here to Stay"" sounds good at first, but the bridge of that song is rediculous, and listening to one song over and over again is sad. This album confirms that even korn is not immune to the seemingly inevitable slow,poppy death that so many good bands have experienced. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,KoRn R Untouchable,"This cd is awsome. The riffs are mind blowing and this has to be the hardest album KoRn have ever done. I love jons lyrics, they tell the fans about his life and how hards its been for him. They also connect with the listener in a way you never thought possible. If your a fan of rock/metal this is definalty the album for you. I would highly recommend this album. KoRn are Here To Stay and so am I as a fan."
3,Alright,"I am not going to bash on the album because I really do like Korn (mainly the older stuff. I just found this album a little lacking in the intensity that made me a Korn fan. It seems a little too polished, not rough enough. A favorite of mine though is Thoughtless but don't think that personifies the rest of the album. Basically I would say that if you liked Issues you would like this."
3,3/5,This album is 3 stars because many of the songs are listenable. I rather enjoy listening to this album.I just recommend this album. Addy.
4,Return to form.,"Untouchables is great and it's their best effort. It's a lot better than their 2 previous albums, Follow the Leader was too mainstream and generic in my opinion. Issues was good but Untouchables, Life is Peachy and Korn are a lot better. The band evolved into something more than just nu-metal. Untouchables is a return to form and one of the best Korn albums to date."
4,Korn Is Back.....Sorta,"Needless to say, Korn invented the ""nu-metal"" sound the younger generation can't get enough of. Most listeners didn't jump on the Korn bandwagon until the days of Follow the Leader, but hopefully those people went back to listen to Korn's earlier stuff which is their best, as usual with most groups. After Issues it seemed Korn was starting to lose a bit of their edge, softening out a bit and making songs more radio-friendly. However, after listening to the new CD it's good to see that they haven't lost their edge, at least on most of the songs. A few tracks like Hollow Life, Hating, Alone I Break are on the softer side but they are still good tracks. Overall this is a very good CD but it's still no self-titled Korn. That's okay though because it shows Korn is not afraid to try other things and change it up once in a while, instead of being the same stagnant band like so many others do. This CD is definitely worth the money ..."
4,Korn 4 EVER,"Do you swear to play the Korn, nothin but the Korn, so help you God? Nah just kiddin peeps, but this is an awesome CD. Play your favorite tracks like Thoughtless, and Here to Stay. Ive been a rock fan since I was 8 years old, and this one is Here to Stay."
5,BRILLIANT!,"I can hardly imagine one running out of words of praise for this book. What a treat! I would read it on the bus to and from work (5-odd years since graduating in pure mathematics I became nostalgic), making my 25-minute ride (one way) pass in no time...To write on any subject, one obviously needs the knowledge of it. However, to write a MASTERPIECE (about masterpieces in the chosen field), I think, requires two more ingredients: passion for the subject, in this case mathematics and its history, and the talent for writing about it in an engaging way. William Dunham undoubtedly demonstrated both.A MUST READ FOR A MATHEMATICIAN!"
5,A fun and easy read,"As someone who is primarily interested in mathematics, I found the way this book begins each chapter with the story of a person to be very engaging. The technical details are very gentle and the historical context that the author puts them in makes this fun little book a quick and easy read."
5,What a book like this should be!,"A very enjoyable reading for those interested in basic math mixed with just enough relevant history to make it interesting.My only quibble is that even though we read about Gauss, the prince of math, in two large sections in different chapters, his work is not showcased as main topic."
4,Wow.,"The Legend of Zelda is the most amazing series ever. Now that you can get The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda II the Adventures of link, OOT, and Majora's mask are games getabl;e frolasjkn"
3,Not as edgy but worth buying...,"The first time I listened to the CD it threw me for a loop. It's not as ""edgy"" sounding as her previos CD's, it's more mellow and easy going. However, after about the third time listening to it, it grew on me. If your a Fiona fan you'll find that it's worth buying!"
3,FA3: Fiona's back w/ 20% more music,"Musically similar to ""When the Pawn"". Not as (beautifully) dark or angry as that album, but still with its fair share of angst (but sadly, no profanity). Twelve songs/tracks, booklet includes lyrics."
3,granny smith songs,"my brother really likes this girl. he asked our mom to buy only apples for a month before this came out so he could free something. i think the girl singing is scary and is having a bad day. i like happy music, not stuff about mean film directors like this one. i hope this lady meets someone who makes her happy so she doesn't stay so angry and then she'll be ok. the music is ok."
2,A Disappointed Fan,"I've been a fan of Fiona Apple ever since I saw her first video on VH1 for ""Shadowboxer"". TIDAL is a terrific album and my personal favorite of hers. All the songs on it are filled with deep emotion and soul. Her voice and lyrics are heartbreaking. I give it 5 stars. 1999's WHEN THE PAWN... is a little more up beat but still has all the same emotion. 4 1/2 stars. I was thrilled after 6 years that she was coming out with a new album. Once I bought EXTRAORDINARY MACHINE and listened to it I have to say I was very disappointed. I just don't know how to describe this record. Five of the songs are the same Fiona Apple I have loved for years but the other seven are just NOT her. The lyrics are great but the music with hip-hop and techno beats DO NOT do her extrordinary voice justice. Overall, EXTRAORINARY MACHINE is just not worth the $15 bucks. Even for the most hard core Apple fan like me."
2,way too overrated,"a friend of mine told me this album is a piece of musical genius and much better than the mainstream music out there so I gave it a ilsten and this is what I have concluded:her voice is pretty and smoky but she is by all means NOT a musical genius! So what if she uses live instruments and broadway influences in her music? It doesn't give her credibility if the lyrics are crap and the music is redundant! For instance one song had a nice beat and then she starts chanting YOU SILLY STUPID BLEHHHH she sounds like my 14 year old having a tantrum when she's supposed to be in her late 20's. Lisa Marie Presley's dirty laundry CD would be a better choice over this, her lyrics are much better than fiona's, she has more emotion, and their voices are very similar so I think her album would be a better choice over this. It's no wonder her record label wanted to save her the embarassment of releasing this album."
3,"I'm with the ""I-prefer-the-leaked-version"" camp ...","...dare I add my opinion in that I much prefer the leaked internet version of EM compared to this official release? A friend of mine bought this and I borrowed it from him, and good thing ... it's ruint! Just like what a lot of other folks say ... the strings are gone from ""Not About Love"" ... that song was awesome in Jon Brion form. Elizondo what's-his-name crapped it up. The most glaring indecency comes with ""Red, Red, Red"" ... that song, in original form, was so great ... haunting and chaotic and ruthless in its approach. Now it's dull and slow.Fiona, baby ... if you ever do a 2-cd re-release and include BOTH versions, I might help you buy another limo or whatever ... but for now, I'll enjoy my FREE 'Jon Brion' copy of ""Extraordinary Machine."" You shouldn't've messed with a good thing."
2,Fiona say it isn't so...,"Maybe I had lofty expectations for this album, but in my laymen's opinion this album did not even come close lyrically or rhythmically to her previous two albums. It is a shame because I really wanted to like this album, or maybe I was looking for more consistency in the songs, but I just did not feel it. Sure there are a few noteworthy songs, but unfortunately this album on the whole was a let down. I just hope I will not have to wait so long for her next one."
4,Plain Records might have learned from their mistakes...,"I don't know what the other reviewer is so upset about, but this reissue really isn't anything to complain about. Plain Records is known for resissuing vinyl and squeezing 70 minutes onto a single record. On Extraordinary Machine, they've spanned the record over 2 LPs, 180 gram weight, with 4 tracks on each side. Another plus is that although this isn't a gatefold album, they've made enough room to slide both LPs together into the cardboard sleeve. Basically, 2 records are in one pocket, but it's not so tight that it will distort the vinyl or the cardboard sleeve. GOOD JOB PLAIN!I can't compare the sound to the first pressing of Extraordinary Machine, but that was a single vinyl, probably 120 gram. This reissue will make a nice addition to your collection."
4,How Jimmy became Conan.,"Gosho Aoyama, Case Closed vol. 1 (ViZ, 1994)Back before I switched cable companies, I got a station called ColoursTV of which I was greatly enamoured. Prime time weekdays was reserved for Funimation, an importer of anime that managed to come up with the some of the coolest shows I've ever seen come out of Japan. One of them, and the one I miss most dearly these days, was Case Closed. So when I found the manga sitting at my local library, I was overjoyed and immediately dove in.Volume 1 gives us the story of Jimmy Kuda, high school super-detective, before he becomes Conan Edogawa. (Because the idea of a high-school super-detective just isn't enough weirdness for a manga, it seems.) We see him solve a few cases, meet some of the main characters, and get himself into the tangle that results in the creation of his alter ego, pint-sized primary-school sleuth Edogawa. Fast-paced and fun, a good start to the series. ***"
2,A puzzle.,"I'm a huge fan of Ms. George's work and I was puzzled by this short book of mystery stories. They seemed like something a person would write for an adult education language arts class - maybe they were, for something she was teaching? She joined her students in the exercise? I don't know the background. They seemed like skeletons of stories. Why release them, then? They didn't even serve as something a fan could use to tide her over until the next novel, because her usual characters don't appear (except for a cameo by Lynley and his wife in the first story). Please Ms. George, write another full length novel that features Barbara Havers heavily. It's what a lot of fans are waiting for."
4,"Just like the novels, only shorter...","The three short stories in this volume contain all of the elements of George's novels; I was pleasantly surprised that the author displayed her talents so handily in these pieces, and have read each of them more than once. I recommend this book for George fans, George beginners, and anyone who appreciates a well-structured short story."
5,Highly recommended for all photographers new and old.,"I just bought a NIKON F3hp camera, and together with the NIKON field guide I am ready to start learning the art of photography. This book is very detail in both the technical aspects of photography and also some basic rules that most photographer may overlook. Every time I read through this book I found something new and interesting to learn. This is the only Photographer handbook you will ever need to buy. This book has become the fixed item in my camera bag, and I will never never leave home without it."
4,Great book for the advanced amateur / Pro,"I own numerous Nikon cameras. This book is great as a quick reference, and for ideas on how to handle exposure for various situations most photographers don't experience. It has great tables and such.I didn't find much in this reference confusing. I read books on photography, plus various magazines.This is one of two small references I carry with me in my bag when I'm shooting. The second, I got at the Nikon School."
3,Disappointed with ending,"While I generally love Karen Kingsbury's books, and believe she is one of the most gifted writers of today, it seems her books are becoming too sad and leave me feeling down instead of uplifted. I know Karen desires to deliver spiritual messages in her books and not just entertain the reader, but feel this could be done without all the ""heaviness"". There is so much sadness and heartache in our lives as Christians. I still read fiction books to find a ""And they lived happily everafter"" ending. Apart from the sadness, the characters are very real and the writing itself is beautiful, as with all of Karen's books."
5,Very good,"While it was a little predictable. I really enjoyed this book. This was the first book I read by Kingsbury, and I really look forward to reading more by here!"
1,A truly Clintonesque picture of Jefferson,"This is truly a book of speculation, fluff and bad biography.Most of the book focuses on Jefferson's sex life and the author's speculations about it. (Did he or didn't he? Could he or couldn't he?) Even if there were a shred of evidence about any of this, I wouldn't care to know, and since it is all just guesswork, it is even less interesting.It would be a terrible shame if this were the only Jefferson ""biography"" that one read. There are so many great Jefferson biographies out there, that your time could certainly be much better spent."
2,Wont buy a Del tv again,"Product was great while it lasted. Tuner went out in 6 months and the repair cost was more than what I paid for the tv, so I told the shop to just keep it."
1,Republicans are funny,"First of all, I can't help noticing that all of the reviews favoring this book are riddled with spelling errors, grammar flaws, or both. I think that's a pretty good commentary on their reliability."
2,Not good - but liberal responses betray hypocricy,"As a Republicrat, I enjoy slams against both parties. Al Franken's book was full of self-absorbtion and shallow thought, but this book was just plain unfunny and simple. However, I notice people making assumptions about conservatives in general based on this book - exposing their hypocricy. I thought we weren't supposed to make broad generalizations about a group of people based on one member of that group. shame on you, liberals..."
1,If you dislike Franken and had your sense of humor surgically removed . . .,This book is a bad response to a well written book by Franken. Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot is a side splitter even if you do not agree with Franken's politics.This is a tired response to Franken's book and an attack on him. I can live with a public person I like being satirized. I am sure that Al Franken would probably agree that no one is above being poked fun at. I was hoping for a good laugh.The problem I have is that this is completely unoriginal and tries to mimic Franken's style too much. Satire requires a subtlety that Mauro fails to deliver. What makes it bad is that it just comes across as an attack and what is worse is that it's just not funny. I think it takes a bit of brilliance to mimic and come across as fresh Mauro just does not have the talent to pull this off. Good effort that falls flat.
4,A solo Pollard album you won't need to skip tracks on.,"Although there are some Pollard solo albums I've not heard (God, there must be some that even HE hasn't heard), this is my favourite, second only to the previous years' 'Waved Out'. Every song is a winner, or a close second, if 'Waved Out' keeps its top position (certainly of his 96-01 albums) its only because all instruments here are overdubbed by Doug Gillard, with Pollard adding vocals. Resultingly it sounds a little dry and atypically clean at times - the recording process is very obvious - but with such a plethora of great songs, it's not hard to forgive this. And I think there were only 1000 of this pressed! Good God. Then again that's about as many as their first five albums put together."
1,Pray there is no sequel.,"If you are a native of Kansas this book may be a delight. One gets a profound sense of the bifurcation of the Kansas Plains to the industrial machinations of city life. However, if one is looking for literature I recommend looking elsewhere. Even though Cattle Drive is a delightful little tale it leaves the reader with a bad taste in his or her mouth. Why? There is an implicit urge present in the story that verges on Egotism of the highest sort where it is obvious the author struggles not with narrative but his own fascination at his ability to type words. Moreover, the novel would work better if the voice were autodiegetic instead of didactic. If you found that last sentence furstrating don't read the book. Incidently I do recommend the movie City Slickers with Billy Crystal, a tour de force of cinematic comedy. Crystal got it right. Day didn't. Sorry, Mr. Day I hope your next novel acheives what this one obviously aspries to but ultimately fails at."
5,Very Good,The quality of the case is excellent and I would expect to have paid much more. Its padded and large enough to fit a tactical rifle with accessories. I was expecting something cheaper. Will see how it holds up in the rear of the pickup and at the range. For the $ its a deal.
5,Excellent Case for the $$,"This case arrived today and I have to say I am more then impressed with it's value for the $$. I ordered the 42"" and it fits my M16 A2 size AR15 like a glove. The pockets are the correct size for the magazines and I like the single flap that covers all 5 pockets. Also, the padding is just as I wanted..... not so thick that it adds excessive bulk in my trunk and not so thin that I don't feel my rifle isn't protected reasonably well. Fantastic deal and the shipping was warp speed."
1,You get what you pay for-ITEM IS JUNK,"I was looking for a gun case to hold my AR-15. I work in law enforcement, so I wanted something functional and budget minded. I am not that rough on it at all. It goes from my car to the trunk of my squad car. It lasted not even two months and one of the magazine pouches came apart at the bottom seam and my magazine fell to the floor. I looked at the other magazine pouches and they are wearing also and ready to give way. It is cheaply made, but I guess what do you expect for 24 bucks. If you are going to use this product a lot, I suggest looking somewhere else. I need original packaging to send back, which I don't have. Will attempt to contact seller. If no luck with seller, consider this consumer not buying anything from this company again. Even for 24 bucks it should last longer than 2 months."
1,Strap broke within a week,"Metal hook on the strap broke and the zipper 'stretched' at the pointed end of the case. There's no reason for the metal hook to break except it's cheap metal from China. I can sort of see why the zipper broke, there is almost no clearance between my rifle and the case. Manufacture recommends the case length to be at least 2 inches longer than the rifle, however, I believe it should be 3 inches of clearance to be safe. There's lots of stress on the zipper at the end corner due to the tight fit, so the teeth are mangled but functional. Lesson learned, make sure to have at least 3 inches of clearance.I can still use this case. I never really planned on using the strap because it turns the rifle upside down (scope on bottom) and I was concerned about damaging the scope when placing the case on the ground.The price is right, however, I would recommend passing on this product."
4,Fits my SA85M perfect,"Ammo pouches a tight fit for 30 round mag, be careful forcing them in, could rip!!! Wish it had a storage pouch for range gear but overall a nice case."
4,Great price for a great product,"I found that this is the perfect carry for my mossberg 715T tactical 22. Fits perfect, even with a red dot scope mounted on a 1 inch riser. I do have to take off my foregrip for it to fit but it is simple, and the magazine pockets provide a perfect store for the forgrip. provides adequate protection and large zipper holes to add a lock. would buy again. I did go a few inches larger than my gun length and it was a good decision because might be too snug if you choose the length that corresponds with your gun length. 42"" is perfect for my use"
4,A Terrific Product,"This is one well-made case. The interior is well-padded, almost lush. It has a thick-padded handle and a perfectly adequate sling. All in all, it is a terrific bargain at the price I paid (~$27).So why only four stars? The five exterior pockets are designed for magazines - one per pocket - and that's about all. Here's my suggestion. Cut the number of magazine pockets to two, but deepen them so they can carry two mags each. Then used the saved real estate to put a wider, longer pocket for general purpose use.But hey, I quibble."
1,works i guess,the other day before receiving this today my friend sold me his new gun bag that he got al walmart for 26 bucks and is bigger better made and thicker padding then this one so i will be using that instead
2,Not the gun case advertised.,"The gun case advertised had 4 pockets to store your clips/magazines in. When I received this one it didn't have any.I'm surprised that anyone does this especially Amazon who has stellar customer service. Some of the other reviews said the same thing, so obviously there's something going on."
5,Great Case,"Purchased the 36"" digital Camo case for my AR. Impressed with the quality, expected less for only $17! Case is well padded, high quality zipper, shoulder strap has metal connectors. Would have paid more if I had come across it in a store and still thought it a deal. Well worth the asking price."
3,Good case.,This is a good case with storage. The zipper is the only thing I'm not satisfied with. Has good pads for protection.
4,Good for the price,"Very good case for the price, but like someone else noted, order a size bigger than what you think you'll need. Very tight fit for my AR."
5,Excellent gun case,"This gun case holds my 9mm carbine with red dot scope,along with four clips. Good handels and carryinbg strap. excellent price"
4,Simple clean lines,"This is just what I wanted for evenings on the deck. Simple clean lines, no fussiness."
1,to good to be true,This product is a piece of junk....the description suggests a much better quality item.The holders are not even bent consistantly.If it wasn't so inconvienient I would return it.
3,Geared towards the advanced programmer,"I've programmed actionscript the standard way with variables and directly manipulating properties for at least a year now. I found this book a tough read, at least for me. I really wanted to grasp the material but found it lacking in code examples in the beginning sections where important concepts and theory are discussed. OOP is definitely the way to go but I'll have to find another resource. It's more suited for the pure programmer and definitely not a designer."
2,Not effective,"I purchased this thermos locally and I agree with the previous reviewer. It does not keep food warm for long. I preheated the thermos with very hot water, added very hot soup. The soup was luke warm, at best, 3 hours later."
4,Nice piece of work,"This is really cool. Very good carving. My wish is that it came painted like the second picture shown. But that was apparently done by the consumer. I sometimes stand in front of a mirror wielding it and yell something like ""I SUMMON DEMONS"" or ""SMITE MY ENEMIES"". I guess I play to many RPGs.I have 2 minor complaints. First there is a definite line showing that the head and shaft where carved from different pieces of wood. Second, if you NEED a cane for walking comfort, the head has rough, kinda sharp edges that can be uncomfortable to the hand if you need to put weight on it. However, the description states that it is not for ""medical use"", so it's really designed to be a set piece."
5,Classic story about rabbit family.,This children's classic tells the adventures of mischievous Peter Rabbit. Entertaining read-aloud stories. Author Beatrix Potter was a teacher and wrote this masterpiece for the purpose of delighting a sick child.
4,"Very pretty, accessible alt-pop-rock","This CD grows on you, dont throw it away after your first listen! I almost made that mistake. On my first two listens, the only songs i liked were tracks 3, 4, 5 and 7. Disappointed with the album (especially after the acclaim my fave radio station gave it), I slipped it into the shelf along with my plethora of crappy Canadian-Rock CD's. Well, I decided to pop it back in after a year and a half of growth in my musical palate, and I was glad I did. I was blown away by many of the songs I did not enjoy at first. My faves now include ""Ma Solituda"", ""Here Comes The Fat Controller"" and ""For Dreaming"", but I still like ""Delicious"" and ""Satellite"". This is a consistently pretty album, and now I can hardly wait until Wishville comes out."
1,Puttin' On the Dawg,"The reason I picked up this book was because there was a picture of a Boxer on the cover. The only thing that kept me reading it was that I was dying to see if Louise ever got poor Libro's bad leg checked out. I could have skipped to the last chapter to find that out but the story does give one an insight on dog ownership in New York. It is a completely different experience than anyplace else. The author is far too self-centered to own a pet. The dog seems more like an accessory that the author values less than her little black book. Maybe Libro can teach her a thing or two about unconditional love and the difference between love and lust. I never got the impression that Louise loved Libro. He was more like a puzzle to figure out and cope with. Even the title tells him to bark if he loves her. Get over yourself, lady!"
5,good product,"came as described before expected delivery date. I'm a size 14 and it fits, can stretch a little bit more in the waist but I'm not quite sure how the arms would look."
4,"I love The Who, but the reviewer before me could be wrong","I love The Who more than anyone. I am the biggest fan, but I have a bone to pick with the first reviewer on here who said this is a ""classic live"" album. It is NOT a live CD, even though many people continue to claim this. Every song on here is a studio version, just like the original 1968 LP and the first CD version released in the 1980s. I wonder if the first reviewer even listended to this CD, or the original LP for that matter.Peace, and long live the mighty WHO!"
3,2.5 stars: For Who Completists Only,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this was a slapped together album of Who singles and tracks from other albums. MCA made the record hastily while the Who was working on ""Tommy."" ""Run, Run, Run"" is on the ""Happy Jack"" album, ""Our Love Was/Is"" is on the ""Who Sell Out."" ""Disguises"" isn't a bad song, but here it sounds as if someone is kicking a sheet of metal while Daltrey is trying to sing. A better, live version of the song exists on the Who at the BBC compilation. The two best songs here--""Magic Bus"" and ""Pictures of Lily""--are avaliable on the much better ""Meaty, Beaty, Big, and Bouncy."" But if you are a Who fanatic, it might be worth getting a used copy of this CD. The more obscure tracks aren't bad, but not worth the $15 new price tag."
2,re: clinical handbook,"no wonder the item was soo cheap, it was an earlier edition; the image or picture they posted was of the latest edition. the item was in good condition, though, and it came quickly. just hoped the seller gave a more accurate description."
1,not one of my favs.,i love most motor albums but this one and snake bite love and are not great albums in my book not even close to most of there other albums.but that is just my opinion.
5,Sex on a CD platter,"This is one sexy album. On good playback equipment she is sitting on your lap singing in your ear. I can hear the intake of each breath as she phrases. The subtlety and shading is magical. Total seduction, I'm hooked."
5,She's as good as Weslia Whitfield!,"Diana Krall is a young Weslia Whitfield. And that, my fellow music lovers, is about as good as one can get!I've had this CD for almost a year now and have not tired of it yet. ""Peel Me a Grape"" is one of my faves, as is ""The Gentle Rain.""Krall has a wonderful future and I look forward to more of her work."
4,She's got the voice!,"I love the selection of songs- Peel me a Grape! Her voice is wonderful. When she matures she will give the ""greats"" a run for their money."
2,"Good lungs and equally as good digits, but certainly not new","I did enjoy this.. however, I couldn't play it again. It's not original (or not enough)... so to me, it doesn't make it back into the ol' cd player. Lets face it, we all have talent, but, it's that extra special twist, jive or groove you put into that talent that make runners constantly return to the starting tape. She just doesn't seem to have that (yet). Course, it doesn't hurt to be beautiful.. =)"
2,Diana where are you?,"In her earlier tribute to Nat King Cole, Diana Krall seemed focused on the music-that is, great jazz tunes made greater by Mr. Cole. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel she simply sang each melody with wonderful timing, a luscious voice, and topped each off with uncomplicated but amazingly interesting piano.With this CD I was immediately struck by the fact that this recording was not about the music at all, but instead was all about Diana Krall. She seemed to be hamming it instead of singing. What happened to the melodies? Where was the piano? Where is the respect for the songwriter?Boozy drawling is OK, but Diana Krall can do much, much better than this."
4,Diana's Tribute to Love,"This is Diana Krall's tribute to love. She is at her most intimate here, as a lover expressing herself through a full range of emotions, with some of the most romantic music ever written. At times, playful and coy, at other times, sad and lonely, her interpretations of these classic songs are always brilliant, leaving the listener wanting more. Her ability and confidence, for example, to take a standard like Gershwin's, ""They Can't Take That Way From Me"" and bring out nuances missing from even Astaire's version puts her in the first tier of song stylists. This is music for the loved and the lovelorn. We all have our personal ""Love Scenes"". These songs speak for to anyone willing to listen. And to love."
5,Inspired vocal & keyboard interpretations of old favorites,"Diana continues souful renditions of old favorites in the same vein of her ""All for You"" release. I can't decide if I enjoy her talents as a jazz pianist or her soulful voice more. Both are amply demonstrated on this release. A must for any jazz collection."
4,lovit,"happy am i to stumble upon a voice on the car radio one day...so familiar, yet so fresh and above all.....warm, lovely, understandable...where have all the singers gone? how could such a talented,sensitive woman have hidden such talented expression of delivery for so long....presentation lives!"
5,I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.,"I first saw this lady on 'Tonight with Jules Holland'. I was instantly taken with the slow, bluesy sound and wanted more. This is sexy music at its best and if you can't make love to this then you never will.Steve Branley"
5,The perfect size!!!,"I have looked and looked, for months, for a three quart cast iron to replace my 3 quart tin roaster. As a recent convert to cast iron, finding the smaller sizes is a challenge, I only cook for three people.this pan is godsend, a small chicken fits perfectly, as does pork ribs for three.I am using the cookbook "" glorious one pot meals"" to inspire me. This pan cooks wonderfully, cleans up in a snap, and is the correct size and shape. Buy one!"
3,"Good, but not worth the 7 year wait","Buy this thing used if you see it. Odds are you will see it used a lot. The album is frankly not that good. It has its moments, the last half is fairly heavy, but the first half is boring. The tribute to 911 (is bad), a real tribute can be found on Impelliterri's System X cd. Sorry Manowar. Karl Logan is no Ross the Boss, there are no themes, no great solos, and the riffs are lacking. Eric Adams is in fine form, but I would expect more from his bandmates. It has been 7 years and we get a half metal, half experimentation album. Perhaps the new tracks on the yet to be single will rock."
5,Really Good!,"Warriors of the World is my first Manowar album, so I can't really look back at the other releases.I reallt enjoyed the musical skill in the music, it creates a great athmosphere! I really like the way these guys play. The lyrics are good but the words ""Fight"" and ""Die"" get repeated all over again. Still every song has it's own style and is enjoyable.This is really good release!"
1,What the hell is that?,"After song number one, I thought this will be a good album... ahah! it's a joke, the worst album ever. From song 2 to 8, it's kind of a joke, is it heavy metal, I don't think so! Don't by this album, unless your never heard this band and you like opera. I can't even think how a true fan can give this album a 5 stars. I gave 1 star and if I had the choice, I had choose 0 star, or 5 tomatoes. NEVER BUY THIS ALBUM, PLEASE!"
5,Good product,"I really enjoy this album, as Call to Arms, Warriors of the World United, and Hands of Doom are perfect for when I'm playing Warhammer Online."
1,Are you kidding?,"Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Manowar fan. I put up with a lot ... from my friends because they don't like the group. I've gone to concerts by myself because no one would go with me. However, this is possibly the worst CD I've ever bought. I wouldn't sell this on ebay because I would feel bad I passed this ... onto someone. Maybe this was an experiment. If it was, it was a bad one. I want the Manowar that wrote Revelations, Kill With Power and Battle Hymns."
4,Eating away,"After looking at various gas powered trimmers all priced over a $100, I was kind of hesitant considering the price, but overall it turned out to be a great product. A bonus is the edger which can be purchased as an attachment saving on the cost of buying a separate edger."
1,Junk,"I didnt buy mine from Amazon but I can say this thing is junk. Bought it brand new last summer. Problems starting it right out of the box. All summer, difficult to start. Took it out this spring, wont stay running. Changed plug, gas and took the carb apart and cleaned it. No good. Never Again with TB!"
5,A Gem - Dont Let the Low Price Fool You!,"This CD is proof that price has no correlation with quality when it comes to music CDs. This CD is full of short guitar pieces by masters such as Villa-Lobos, etc, and every song is beautiful and well crafted. None of the music featured on this CD is cheap - it is top quality latin classical guitar music. Another reason to get this CD is that many of the songs featured on this CD are rare and not easy to find. Lastly, the sound quality is surprisingly good and most audiophiles won't be disappointed.Currently on amazon, this CD is going for 99 cents used. Spend a buck and get one of the best CDs of your guitar music collection."
4,It will definitely grow on you if you're a Wyclef fan,"If you read the review on this site and in Time magazine, you wouldn't even want this cd if it was given to you for free. Well, a friend gave me this cd and warned me that it isn't as good as his previous work. I gave it a chance and the first 2 times I agreed that it wasn't that good. But then since there are some catchy tunes on it, I thought i'd give it a few more listens and then return it if i really couldn't hang. I must say that it's definitely worth buying. The tracks i live best are ""oh what a night"" ""daddy"" ""peace god"" and the reggae track ""war no more"". If you like caribbean songs, you'll love the bonus track ""mvp kompa"". Give it a chance!"
1,"Fine selection, terrible singer","From the samples, i gather that Ian Hobson has an ugly, wobbly voice, with no sense of line. Avoid this one!"
2,im so disappointed,"when i saw this months ago i couldnt wait. i thought, finally on dvd, the kinks story will be told by the band. it is sort of. it would have been better if sound quality was better. come to think of it, the picture quality was very poor as well. most of the music videos were from the One for the Road dvd which you can get here in 5.1. the price was too high as well. it should be a bargain bin dvd. so dont waste your money. im hoping a better quality dvd will be released someday."
4,Cute little Carebear,"This is adorable and can be used with or without the others in the set! I ordered it for Christmas for my Grown Up Son! hes been collecting these since he was 2 and loves them, they are great for any age!"
2,"Dissipointing, But I knew that before I bought this.","This is Raine Maida's Our Lady Peace. I dont like to say bands sell out, but they really did here. There is nothing unique about this record except that there is a few decent songs. Without longtime gutair played Mike Turner and Saul on the cover, there just another EMO band thrown into the mainstreem. ""All For You"", ""Not Enough"" and ""Bring Back The Sun"" are very good different songs but the rest of the cd is poppy. Happiness(thier 3rd cd) was hard with a pop tinge and had alot of different sounds that made it unique but this cd is pop with out the crazyiness of ""Clumsy"" and the pefect of thier best cd ""Naveed"". This dosent destroy OLP's career but certainly wont help. So anyone bring back the SAUL.........."
4,I Miss the old OLP,I'm a really really big olp fan...and as good as Gravity is...Its not the same!Their sound has seriously changed... Gravity is a great rock album but it is missing the our lady peace alternative twang!It has some great songs like made of steel or innocent.... but nothing like starseed or even potato girl!
4,its aiight... it gets better...,"hey the cd's pretty good, itdoes give a couple a good songs like bring back the sun and all, but id have to say spiritual machines was better but thats just it, i like the cd i listen to it so its gotta be doin something good!"
2,OK,"I was expecting a lot more from this. I have been into OLP since Clumsy, and I have seen them live three times.I think, that the Bob Rock production is good, but the songs just don't have that classic OLP feel to them.Hopefully next album they will get it back."
2,WARNING,"The single ""Somewhere out there"" on this album is NOT the version Fievel sings in An American Tail. This one is about some purple haired girl who tastes good, probably like grape."
2,Disappointment,"I am extremely disappointed with Our Lady Peace's new CD. I am a great lover of their music, and anticipated the arrival of their new Cd with excitment. However, as soon as I listened to it I discovered that it was of lesser quality than any of their earlier music. This CD has none of the charateristic voice prominent in their earlier CDs. As much as it pains me to say this, Our Lady Peace now sounds like any generic rock band. None of these songs are up to the level of Clumsy and Superman's Dead."
5,gravity,"this is such an amazing album, i listen to it everyday.heres my rating of the songs.all for you - 10/10do you like it - 10/10somewhere out there - 11/10innocent - 10/10made of steel - 10/10not enough - 10/10sell my soul - 10/10sorry - 10/10bring back the sun - 10/10a story about a girl - 11/10thats 2 11/10 songs, i dont do that often."
1,good idea but....,"The idea of this book is great, but since there is no consistent method of measurement it's impossible to use. It's inconsistent and inaccurate and worst of all a lazy stab at a good idea. Don't waste your time like me."
5,muser must have,"This soundtrack to Muse's dvd Hullabaloo, is a must have. The double disc features b-sides on one disc and a live performance from Le Zenith in Paris on the other.First disc one. This disc contains a helping of b-sides that are worthy enough to see the light of day. They all sound very different from song to song, but seeing as it's a compilation, it really doesn't matter. I personally like all the songs, but I like Muse, so it's a given really.Secondly disc two. For being a compilation of two shows into one disc, there is very seamless transitions from one song to the next. As far as a live cd, the quality it excellent. It's professionally recorded, so it isn't bothered by lots of background noises and overbearing crowds. It's not quite as good as seeing them live, but it does capture the overall sound very nicely.Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to delve deeper into Muse and their music."
2,"Decent design, poor electronics...","I bought this DVD player thinking ""Wow. Brand name player at a really good price."" Then I got home and used it. Some DVD's played with no problem. But it was more likely that I would see 1 second freezes in the video (not the audio) and sometimes you would get horribly distorted images. Definitely would recommend not buying until GE can get their act together and test their products before selling them."
2,Piece of junk.,"This DVD Player is a piece of junk. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because I can get about two hours of good viewing time PER DAY before the thing overheats and skips and freezes to the point where it spits out the disk and says that it cannot read it. This is a very poorly designed machine. There are NO airvents anywhere on the machine. No heat can escape, which leads to overheating, which causes it to skip like crazy. I used to be very fond of GE. Now I'm not so sure. Reading over the reviews has assured me that this is not an isolated incident. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!"
1,"The holy grail of Gross Anatomy, but, I chose another for the Medical School's curriculum","Very comprehesive( course in medical school every course is!).........but, I chose to use another atlas during Gross Anstomy in my first year of Med School.....only bought this one for a friend.......I simply don't like the Gray's selection."
3,Good reference book,"This book is good for reference, but perhaps not so much for specific detail (I would like to see color plates). Bless whoever took the time to make these drawings though!"
3,Printing Not Up to Snuff,"This is a landmark volume in the history of medicine. That said, this printing does not do justice to the famous plates, which were anatomical jewels. The images are dusky, lacking in detail, and don't serve the purpose I purchased the volumes for, which was to educate patients about their conditions.There are better, yet inexpensive versions out there, and I would recommend one of those."
3,wrong edition,"The American Collector's edition has many factual errors (unlike the modern British edition) and suboptimal diagrams. With all editions, it is important to understand that this is a systems based atlas - not a regional atlas. If one wants to trace every branch of an artery, it is very helpful. To understand the relationship between a vessel and nerves in proximity, it is lacking. However, unlike most atlases (Netter, Clemente, Sobatta, Grant's, Thieme, Pernkopf, not to mention the numerous but little helpful photographic atlases), it has considerable text in addition to labels. As a general surgeon (and trauma surgeon for war wounded), I would always pick a regional atlas in preference for clinical work. I've used almost all the atlases at one time or another, and this would be near the bottom of my list for usefulness.LCDR Philo Calhoun MD"
5,Great,"I had never read the book, though I had seen the movie many times. I really enjoyed it and would read it again."
5,A Favorite,"While I haven't read this version yet I seen it for the kindle and knew I had to have it.I love the book, I love the movie (BBC version with Colin Firth), and I love Jane AustinI have to admit that I watched the movie first having avoided the the book for years. I thought it would be to dry and boring. Having seen the movie I had to find out what was left out, so I took the leap.I loved it! I do think that having watched the movie helped. It was pretty well true to the book a few things left out. I did find some parts a bit dry and the speech awkward and don't think if I were younger would have had the patience to move thru it. It is good and definitely worth the push."
3,A romantic classic that everyone must read.,"This was a really good book. I enjoyed the love story and the suspense of how it would end. But it could have been a bit more interesting, at times i found myself skipping many pages to get to a more intereting part. But all-in-all, an excellent book. One of those classics you must read."
4,Good for students,This edition is the best version for high school students to use. Presented in a style easy for school students and still true to the original.
4,Great,An amazing book. After watching the movie more than 20 times I always wanted to read this. It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch.
4,Pretty cover-amazing book!,I got this for my daughter. The pretty cover made it more fun to give this amazing classic love story.
4,Classic,"Tough read, but it's a classic. Half way through and it's hard to put down. I recently read Jane Eyre, so I didn't have to look up as many words : )"
5,Another Jane Austen Fan Here - This is a First Rate Reading Experience,"This is my first experience reading one of Jane Austen's stories. I am only 1/3 of the way through, but am a huge fan already. Cannot wait to get back to the story. I have viewed dramatized versions of the author's stories on PBS and always loved them. I feel like I found a treasure chest full of gold! Thank you Amazon for the free Kindle downloads."
4,Great Classic,"This is a wonderful and timeless classic. But be forewarned that it is not a light read. Because it was written in another era, the dialogue takes some getting used to and I found myself re-reading sections to make sure that I fully understood the conversation. In any event, readers will fall in love with the characters, especially Lizzy and Jane, and delight in the many entertaining scenarios."
2,Pride and Prejudice,"In trying to get books imported to my newly-purchased Kindle, this one made it to the Kindle but was not really a title I wanted."
3,"Classic, but why?","I read the entire thing. I can't even explain why. The characters were flat. The plot was predictable. The writing didn't really stand out. I still read it all the way through, so I guess that counts for something."
3,"Amazing book, not a great version",As always this is an amazing book but this version was a pit disappointing. Certain words were left out which would make it hard for someone who has never read the book. For someone who is familiar with the book this isn't a huge issue especially since its free.
5,Kept my interest,"I wanted to read a classic and with my new Kindle Fire, I did just that. I enjoyed the story and will read more by Jane Austen."
5,"Great storytelling, beautiful characters.","It's a beautiful story and a great title: the first part, our hero, Elizabeth, fights with what she thinks is the pride of Mr. Darcy. Then, when she discovers he's a gentleman with a very strong personality, she has to turn al her prejudices against him on his favor. It's a beautiful story."
4,Re-reading Pride and Prejudice,"I don't know how many times I've read this novel. Lately, I've listened to it on audio books and read along every evening. Sometimes I would jump ahead and then re-read that section. It was so fun...I know it sounds a little odd. I bought a used copy because I have several others, unfound upon quick glance, scattered about the house. Nice, comfortable copy."
5,Everything that has been said and more...,"I can't add anything new to the already glowing reviews for this masterpiece. One needs to have an appreciation for the time period to truly enjoy this comic 19th century irony. Worth any literate and intelligent person's time, and should be on every woman's 'lifetime reading list'. BRAVO!"
4,Great,I loved the story and all of the characters were so relatable. My favorite though was Mr. Bennett. He was hilarious with his sarcasm and dry humor.
4,Good so far,"I am about 75% of the way through this book and can say it is enjoyable, even for a guy."
4,Orgullo y Prejuicio,"Realmente un clásico, que he leído varias veces y puedo seguir leyendo. Digno representante del romanticismo, describe las costumbres de la época en la campiña inglesa"
2,........Yawn.......Yawn.........ZZzzzZzZzZzzzZZZzzz,"I thought this book would be a lot better than what it turned out to be... for my summer reading requirements i came across this book title and went to this site, amazon.com to see what it was like.... all reviews seemed to be saying that it was an excellent book, yet when i picked it up, i had the hardest time getting past the 10th chapter, i didn't really understand it or discover all that others had... if you have this book on your list for high school reading, be sure you have a lot of free time because you need to read it over quite a few times to understand all aspects of the language, trends, and characters of the story, a modernized version would be a much better one to understand.... this book was written a bit too long ago for me!"
1,Book Never Arrived,I purchased this book before Thanksgiving which was supposed to arrive between the 12th and the 21st. I still have not received it. Meanwhile I purchased two other books from other suppliers which arrived within 2 weeks. I will never purchase from this supplier again.Extremely dissatisfied!
3,"Decent, but the Bronte sisters are much better","Pride and Prejudice, what a long book!!! Pride and Prejudice consists of 3 books. In those days, authors were forced to write extremely long novels, if not, chances are, the novel would have not been printed. With sitting by a fire, and reading the favorite means of entertainment, novels had to be long , to take up time. Basically, thats all Pride and Prejudice did for me, take up time. If the novel would have been condensed into one book, it would have been much better, and probably would have received 5 stars from me. Elizabeth, the star character is very likeable and we all seem to look up to her. Her epiphany......""how despicably have i acted......till this moment I never knew myself!"" Is worth reading the novel for."
2,boring!!!,i read this book becuase i heard how great it was. it has so many great reviews. honestly i think the book was just ok... too much of nothing was written. i found myself forcing to finish the book thinking it was going to get better. the best part was the end. now i can read a better book. sorry jane austen but this now makes me think twice about reading your other books. i was disappointed.
2,unrealistic,"Of course, literature does not have to be realistic to be great, but for me, it has to have something that is at least so in a figurative level. I find the main characters in this book to be rather shallow. Most pepole go through life without seeing their pride and prejudice, so how can Elizabeth and Darcy do it with such ease? I fail to see, other than a nice, happy story, what gives this novel its value."
3,Not my cup of tea.,"My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 6. Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up. Not my sort of novel or subject."
5,Amazing!,"Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me."
4,Amazing,What a great love story!Austen did a amazing job I only wish she continued to tell more about Elizabeth's life after the marriage!
4,incomplete version,"I love this book and re-read it nearly every year. I just downloaded the free version to read on my new kindle. There are 4 paragraphs missing in chapter 1, at least one word in chapter 2... And that's as far as I have gotten. So the item loses a star for being incomplete"
3,Movie better than the book,"Ok book. Movie was better and easier to follow on than the books. Liked the characters in the movie better than those in the book,."
3,"I know is a classic, but not my style","The book is slow, takes a lot of time in details that I supposed where very important for the time, but for me they are not. I just think if your are looking for historic novels you can find something better. If you're looking for a love story very romantic and classic, I supposed this is the right one; I have to say that all my girlfriends love it... so I supposed it can be very enjoyable for some kind of people, not for pragmatic people like me."
4,Pride and Prejudice,Long and wordy. Don't read it when you are tired as it does require some concentration. Keep your characters straight!
5,Pride and Prejudice (Penguin Classic),"The story is famous and in no need of review. The Penguin classic has decent size print and makes the effort to come as close to the original manuscript as is reasonably possible. What more is there to want? Also the price is excellent, so that it will not be difficult to replace after I have worn it out."
5,Great classic with funny but interesting sidenotes,"I am a big fan on Jane Austen, so when this book was put out I had to get it. The book its self is written just like the classic; however, it has humorous and interesting side notes through out the book. I find the side notes very fun and interesting to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the classic version."
1,Oh! My!,"I know it's a ""classic"", but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters. Little more than local gossip among the local teens!"
2,Wasn't Happy,"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book. I had never heard of the bed books before and I can't get used to the sideways printing. Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."
2,Unfortunately edited version,"I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text. This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these ""free"" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these."
5,A Beautiful Book for Girls,"Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader. Pride and Prejudice is an excellent book. It tells a story of five young girls to be married and has a very engaging plot. Young girls will not be disappointed with Jane Austen's novels. All her works are very inspiring.Cynthia Marie Rizzo author of ""Angela and the Princess"" and ""Julie and the Unicorn"""
5,A Timeless Classic,"This classic tale of romance in Victorian Britain will have you coming back to read it again and again. If you haven't read it already, you'll want to pick it up."
3,Revisiting a secondary-school bore,"Okay, I'll admit that at 14 y o and interested in modern biographies and war stories, Pride & Prejudice bored me stupid.Re-reading it now (from a sense of obligation) I actually can see the humour in it, the easy development of characters and their relationships and interactions.I can now identify characters to loathe (the girls' mother) and which I can like.But I guess it will never be more than a tedious ""okay"", I guess."
1,Hated It!,"Like others, I really did want to like this book. I tried and tried to read it, but it was all nonsensical jibber-jabber. I may try again, but doubt it. It's torture!"
4,All talk,"I watched the movie and expected the book to be much the same. The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works."
5,Classic Austen,I originally read Pride and Prejudice in a college English class almost 40 years ago and got this copy to reread for a class I am taking now. The book is just as wonderful as I remember it!
5,A must read,"This is one of the best writing of Jane Austen's.The title aptly says in a few words what the wholestory was about. Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa? It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways. They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!"
5,Entertaining! Defintely reading pleasure!,"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"
4,Pride and Prejudice,"I liked this book, because it describes a situation that isn't weird. It could really have happened. I was surprised that I liked this book, because classic books are mainly boring, because of the fact that things happen very slowly. In Pride and Prejudice things didn't happened quickly but the book kept your attention.Melissa Nuis"
2,Maybe not for the Men,"This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout. This story did not have enough action or masculine characters for my taste, but I understand it's a classic. The wahines must love Mr. Darcy."
2,"its like this sappy love story, which goes on and on, and on","should have given it only 1 star, but since it is a well liked classic and i'd actually like to save the flames, i'd make it a two. i've read this book 2 times. the 1st time i got to the 40th page, the 2nd time i finished it. i tried to understand, i really did...fine, i didnt. but this story is just so plain un appealing. you spend the whole book hooked on elizabeth bennett and mr darcys'...love affair. it would actually be better if the two fine main characters did not live their lifes in complete fluffness.the love lifes of a group of...giggling girls and the 'dashing' mr darcy, how much more interesting can it get?"
3,Review,"Difficult at first, but soon after enjoyed the love story. Loved Elizabeth's character and Jane. Darcy was frustrating! Mrs. Bennett was quite comical!"
5,Pride and Prejudice,"Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice is, in my opinion, one of her best works. It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel."
5,Great Read!,"Though it may take some determination to plough through some of the long dialogs and other parts in this book, P and P is definitely a book that readers should try to read. Austen did a fantastic job with the characters, and their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, she did a great job persuading the reader to switch back and forth to Wickham and Darcy's different sides.P and P is a book to not be overlooked! Everyone can get something out of it, whether that be knowledge, or just another wonderful and fun read."
4,Loved it!,"I love this book. I've gone over it again and again, and I still love it. A couple parts may be tedious at times (like Mr. Collins...blech), but over all, a really good book. Not to mention, this book is pratically free! Two thumbs up!"
5,My Favorite Story of All Time,"I first read this book when I was about 15 years old, and I loved it. Even though it took me some time to understand the old english text, the meaning was still there. Just recently (now I am 18) I saw the tv mini series of Pride and Prejudice, and fell in love with it all over again! You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence. A beautiful tale of old English life, and an easy to love character - Elizabeth Bennet. This is by far my favorite story of all time. I recommend to anyone - including younger people."
5,Too Good,One of the best classics written by Jane Austen. The character of Elizabeth and Dracy are brought out beautifully. The vivid range of emotions of all the characters are a pleasure to read they involuntary invoke reponse from the reader
5,P&P,"This is a classic novel everyone should read. Jane Austin is witty and creative, this book is not just for a high school English class."
2,Not to my taste,"The vocals sounded drowned out in several places by the instrumentals, and they often sounded ""farther away"" and muddied. This wasn't a tight performance, with instrumental oddities appearing here and there. Some vocal choruses appeared shrill. I much prefer either the older Robert Shaw, Atlanta Symphony recording or the James Levine, Chicago Symphony."
3,okay story.,Edited sex scenes should desire graphic detail.Typical asian theatre. It is enetertaining if you like that kind of movie. Not terrible.
4,"Sturdy, good quality and a fair price.","I can find these locally for about ~$2 more than I can on amazon, but with free shipping when I'm buying stuff anyway, I might as well save a couple dollars. I didn't find them to be any less quality than the pad that originally came with the toy. Honestly, it even feels a little bit firmer than the original. The only thing that could've made the fifth star is if it came with a tiny bit of catnip, as the original toy did. Not a huge deal, but it helps get the ball rolling. Hah."
1,Beware of misleading product description,"Just received the package and was surprised to find only 2 pads. The product illustration clearly shows FOUR pads, and the written description refers to it being a ""2 pack"" with ""2 pads per package"". A blatant ripoff...I'm surprised at you, Amazon!"
5,My cat's favorite toy,"My cat is 5 years old now, and I've taken this toy with me from coast to coast, as it's the only thing he really and consistently plays with. He tears through pads in a month or two, but better this than the furniture. And it's easy enough (and cheap enough) to replace the cardboard centers. Highly recommended."
5,My cats' favorite toy,"The Turbo Scratcher is the favorite toy/scratcher of all three of my very picky and hard-to-please cats, so needless to say they destroy the cardboard part pretty quickly. I used to be able to get the refills at Wal-Mart, but they no longer carry them, so I was excited to see that I can buy them on Amazon. I always order a few at a time, so my resident felines are never disappointed."
5,worth every penny!!!,"If you value your furniture, these are worth every penny. Rub in a little catnip, place the turbo scratcher somewhere the cat tends to hang out, and watch them go to town on this thing. They love it."
4,Disturbingly Good,"This is not a travel book and should not be judged as such. No superficial talk here of pretty buildings, uncomfortable hotels or quaint wildlife. Robert Kaplan does not attempt to merely travel in geographic space, but ventures to travel in time. And the image he brings of the future is chilling. I will not try to judge what he writes - that would neither be fair nor appropriate, but how he writes it. In that respect, he is very effective. He almost made me feel the sensation (dread!) of being in these lands and very successfully transmitted his message of the future he fears. Actually, it is perhaps that sense of dread that makes me withold that 5th star. This text is an introduction to much food for thought. I would strongly recommend it."
3,Difficult to set up,"It's very cheap, which is great, but expect it to be difficult to set it up. Because there's no electric pump, you have to do it manually, and it can take awhile to do it."
5,Cheap Goa Trance,"If you want a cheap Goa Trance album that's nothing special but still a great listen buy this, it's worth the money."
5,This is an excellent reference book,I found this book to be well written and to the point. I was able to quickly learn the basics. Yet the book is also a valuable reference book covering all facets of the language. I would highly recommend it.
2,Sizing? way off,"the color is nice. I have bought other brands of body stockings and the sizing was always perfect, plus means for a heavy woman, not tall. This is the first disappointing plus size I have gotten. It is for someone over seven feet tall not someone over 150 lbs. It should be labeled as an extra tall not a plus size. What a waste of fabric. If you are extremely tall and thin, this might be nice. If you are over 150 lbs and under six feet, do not waste your money or time."
3,fishing rod,have not used rod/reel yet. she is eager to use it but unable to accurately rate this item at this time.
5,Excellent Product,This review is from: Equinox Golden Healing Salve 1 oz salve (Health and Beauty)It was purchased from SmallflowerThe product stands on its own merit. It works.The seller gets special kudoos.... Order was lost in USPS.Seller got replacement on the way with apologies. No problem.I am spoiled on Amazon prime shipping and hate to use USPS as this is the secondtime I have lost things in the US Mail... going through Chicago. Hmmmmmm. The city does have a reputation to live up to.Once again... Sold by: Smallflower is very good in no hassle replacement .. with an unnecessary apology.Thanks to them!!KenB
2,Electircal wire connectors,"This item appeared to be more items in the box, Should have read closer!!! Not a very good buy for what I received!!!"
5,A thoughtful and intellegent discourse on the Bible.,"Steve Allen is the rarest of treasures-a comic genius and a deeply profound thinker.As Allen says in this book, and in its prequel, many of us have been guilty of reading the Bible for years without truly considering the impact of the moral values it expounds .Written in a ""dictionary topical"" style, most readers will not likely read it cover to cover in one sitting (though I did). Those who take the time to read its contents, however, will be unable to avoid rethinking and reconsidering their long-held assumptions concerning the teachings of scripture and its impact on Western culture's view of morality."
4,Just Wondering,"I was just wondering why many people were expecting big, huge drastic changes to the game. I mean, the game of football hasn't had any big, huge, drastic changes...has it?"
4,xcellent as a gift,I bought this game 4 my cousins birthday... and he loves it.. but the best thing of all... he loves me more! = )
4,Madden 2007,Great game. Some of the plays I like from Madden 2006 are not there or I can not find them.
2,"Bound Manuscript, not really as expected","While this may be truly a copy of Doctor Thorne by Anthony Trollope, it is in the format of typed or wordprocessed pages that have been bound. It is very large, the size of printer paper. Could not just tuck it in my purse for holiday travels as planned at all. I don't like the printed format, and so I ordered a Penguin version to replace it. This goes in the ""donate"" pile."
5,DD,"DD could mean disturbingly delightful, or delightfully disturbing. Both descriptions seem to fit this book equally well. I picked this one up (random choice, I admit) on sale at a bookstore, and it was worth every penny, and more!Ma Jian captures the spirit of post Tiananmen China in this satirical novel, through a dialog between a professional writer and a professional blood donor. This is not the kind of book you judge based on reviews...its the kind of book you simply have to read, because its worth it."
5,Zevon Gets Metaphysical,"I LOVE this album. I've always been a big fan of Warren Zevon and finally got this one. This is where he got very introspective and wrote songs like ""For My Next Trick I'll Need A Volunteer"" and ""Ourselves To Know."" These are very complex songs. I've already listened to it about 50 times and I've only had it a few months."
2,not as expected,"The picture for these screen covers make it seem as those they are cut to fit the phone, but they are not. You have to cut them and that's more trouble then it's worth. I was disappointed in the product."
4,Nice Fit - No Bubbles,"I received my order promptly. Easy to install without getting air bubbles. It includes a lint free cloth to clean your screen with (pre and post cover install). There's a second protective coating on the cover that you remove once you use the included ""squeegee"" to apply the cover. The second cover allows you to apply firm pressure and to ensure a good fit without air bubbles. It comes with 15 individually packaged covers. Good value overall."
4,Evocative,"An evocative collection of poetry from a promising woman. I'm not sure how to review poetry, but I certainly will say that this is one of my favorite poetry books from this past year. Her language and imagery have stayed with me since I read it in September!"
2,Skip 1.01 and get 1.11,"This cut of the Eva series is awesome, but the DVD for 1.01 has production issues that make the overall image much darker than intended. Night scenes lack detail in particular. This was known in the Japanese release, and remains uncorrected in this North American release. I recommend getting 1.11. Not only is that one color corrected, but it has 2 minutes more footage explaining the complex narrative, and is offered in Blu-Ray. Skip the 1.01 release and just get 1.11. Otherwise, it's a great edit/retelling of the original series, with new characters and different events playing out. This is volume 1 of 4 pending releases, and represent a more mature director's master work. Old fans wont be disappointed, and new fans can ingest more of the main series in much less time."
1,Not worth the 2.50 I paid for it,"I was on the search for some new female vocalists, and looking at the critic review and others on here, I gave this cd a try.From samples I had heard that her voice sounded very pretty, and I still don't disagree with that. However, her work as a talent scout apparently didn't teach her what was catchy and what wasn't. There is no hook anywhere at all on this album. I'm not a pop fan in general, but all songs need hooks. Its what gets you to listen to them, to want to sing along, etc. This cd, while varied in musical styles, stays at a slow dreamy pace throughout. I suppose if you wanted something to sleep to, this would be good.Her lyrics are weak and nearly every song follows the same pattern as far as vocal delivery."
2,Is tankless better?,"When they work, they are pretty nice, and there's virtually no limit to the hot water. However!....they are very demanding of the user: a)you must not use hot water at full pressure...they can't really keep up, at least not at full heat. b) you must not use the water at low pressure, either, for they turn themselves off and will not heat the water at all! There is a very small range of water pressure, and that's not always the right range for your application. I like to take a shower at very low pressure (less wasteful) and fill my spaghetti pot at full pressure (less time to fill)...neither of these is satisfactory with this unit."
2,"Great when it works, second bad board in under 3 years","We wanted an energy efficient option when we built our house 2-1/2 years ago. Just under a year old and the circuit board on the water heater died. We live in rural east Texas and finding someone here to service was impossible. Bosch hotline was not very supportive or helpful, and plan on spending a minimum of 45 minutes on hold. Between hotline, the plumber and electrician they finally decided it was a bad control board. Told me they would overnight a whole new water heater, but shipped it 3-day ground instead (which with the weekend meant 5 days). Now 15 months later we have the same problem all over again. I think we will just go back to a standard tank heater. The tankless is fabulous when it works, but not worth the hassle and expense when it doesn't."
2,Cheaply done and inaccurate,"Unfortunately, this book was done on the cheap from someone who apparently doesn't know the cities (or at least Minneapolis) very well.The reason it feels cheap is that all of the Minneapolis ""then"" pictures are available on the website of the Minneapolis Public library. While there's nothing wrong with the library as a source, I suspect that the research for this book took all of an afternoon. I'd hope for something more interesting than what I could easily find myself, some unique -- or at least not easily accessible -- knowledge of the city. This book provides neither.It's also riddled with inaccurate ""now"" pictures; there are at least three instances in Minneapolis where the ""now"" picture was taken at least a block from the original picture -- and from a completely different angle.I'd recommend Larry Millet's ""Twin Cities Then and Now"" as a much better alternative."
2,Inaccuracies Ruin It,"This book is a collection of old photos matched to new photos supposedly taken of the same locations as they appear today.Unfortunately, there are some very blatant errors. Certain photos look, at first glance, like the same location. But quite a few are actually not. And some that do match the location are taken from a different vantage point, making it hard to understand what exactly you are looking at. I do not believe that the authors reside in the Twin Cities, which may explain the sloppiness.The photographs (both old and new) are nice, hence the two stars. But Larry Millett, a local architecture critic, created a far better volume which was impeccably researched and meticulously rephotographed. Skip this one, and seek out Millett's ""Twin Cities: Then and Now"" instead.+"
2,Justin Bieber: Rise To Fame,"Justin Bieber: Rise to Famei was so excited to actually buy this dvd. but when i got to watch this,i was so disappointed.all you pretty much see are about these 5 unknown/unpopular/uninteresting people that you get to listen to and watch. and it's vexing because they have more to say and face to see than the main performer Justin Bieber. if you are a big fan, don't waste your money on this one. just buy something like the actual movie,NEVER SAY NEVER and more to come from the performer.....DON'T BUY THIS!"
5,Purchased a 2nd book for a friend,"Again, I didn't read this book, but it appears that another friend enjoyed reading it, perhaps one day, I too will have time to read it, thank you."
1,Music for Zombies,"More New Age piano. This is the equivalent of mindless drooling, except it extrudes through fingers onto a piano whose keys deserve better.Am I the only one to notice that the musical theme for track two, ""February Sea,"" is simply the ""Dies Irae"" with a note missing?I don't know if this CD is pretentious or merely fatuous,Buy yourself some music by Jonn Serrie, or Michael Stearns, or Steve Roach,"
2,More tedious than fun,"I am a big fan of this type of puzzle; however, the puzzles in this book are put on too large a grid, so that it is a pain to color in the squares. Furthermore, the first half of the puzzles are ridiculously easy that they take more effort to color than to figure out.I imagine that this book is good for beginners, as other reviewers have mentioned. If you are already familiar with these puzzles, though, I'd opt for a different book."
3,Queen Victoria,"This is an okay book. There were moments where I had to restart a paragraph because I ended up getting lost. It was the first book I read on my Kindle, so maybe it was getting use to that. It dragged from when Prince Albert died until the end. I felt like it was cut up quite a bit, as well. The Kindle version was apparently edited by a volunteer and it was free, so maybe it was that. But overall, it is a good book to read if you would like to learn a little on Victoria's life."
3,Book's data,"Pretty good book if you're serious about this family line. I've noticed on a couple of genealogical sites it could've helped some people. However, some of the data is confusing pertaining to which children belong to which family, mostly involving those with multiple marriages. Also, occasional birth and marriage dates are the same with some individuals, so watch what you're reading. Overall, it's to be expected for a book that's over 1,000 pages long."
4,Solid effort that draws you in,"I actually like this CD better than their future efforts. The lyrics aren't too amazing, but the album succeeds in creating a lush, mystical sound. It might be less slick or professional, but I find it kind of catchy in a less pretentious, unusual way. I especially like ""Change Your Mind,"" ""Off and On,"" ""Run"" and ""Scream."" I think there's plenty of music out there in Hebrew, and Jewishly-themed music in English just captures my attention more. This album is definitely worth more than one listen. After a few go-arounds, I found I had several of the songs stuck in my head."
2,Not worth the money!,It didn't provide any more information than the instruction manual that came with the camera did. Only advantage is the size and shape of the book which feels nicer than holding the manual.
4,Expanded Guid to the N90s's features,This book goes a long way to not only explaining the features of this complex insturment but also why you would want to use them and how to get the most out of them.
3,Over acted by Bates,"I have all Alan Bate's movies. Really enjoy his acting EXCEPT in this production. After viewing Ciaran Hinds version of this tragedy, his acting is perfect and not over stated. Bates rushes thru the tale even tho it is longer and more detailed, he doesn't tell the story well. The Hinds shorter version(200 min) is concise without leaving anything or any emotion out. Comparing the two Rent Alan Bates Mayor of Casterbridge, BUY the Hines version.P.S. In both production the supporting characters are well cast."
5,Love this tea maker...,"I came across this Timolino Tea Maker by chance and I'm so glad I did. Makes about 2 cups of tea. Perfect for home or at the office. I like having tea at work but after a few minutes of brewing in my standard mug, the tea is just warm. This Timolino keeps my tea hot while brewing. Both 3 more as gifts since everyone just loved it."
5,Terrific insulated tea pot,"This is an ingenious design, a tea pot that is insulated like a travel coffee mug. It keeps the water very hot and holds several cups. Perfect for those who like to drink tea in the office without it getting cold."
3,I can't understand the genius -_-...,"I'm 19 years old, and have enjoyed listening, but most of all, playing classical and jazz music whether it be on the flute, electric guitar, or drum practice pad, yet i've realized after purchasing this recording that with 7 years of experience I still can't understand Coltrane's genius...I keep listening to this recording and it all sounds like high school concert band level (not even jazz band) -_-...I find it hard to believe that that's the case, so i've come to the conclusion that i'm still young and lack experience...i feel embarrassed to post this as an up-and-coming musician, but i'm hoping someone can clear this up for me."
1,missing products,I'm satisfied with the slippery stuff gel but did not receive the adult sex toy kit so unable to give a positive review.J. Kunze
1,Completely dissatisfied,"I bought the $20 phone card and am dissatisfied. Because only payphones were available, the toll-free access number had to be used. Using the toll-free access to a local land line to leave an answering machine message of less than 2 minutes (probably closer to 1 minute) caused the phone card to drop from 6 hours to 4 hours and 45 minutes. That's ridiculous. It should not cost 1 hour and 15 minutes to leave a message on an answering machine.I would not buy this card again nor would I recommend this card to anyone else. I am very disappointed in this product."
3,Not Zevon's Strongest,"I love Warren Zevon but I have to say that although this is better than most artist's work, it's not Zevon's best. It has a patchy uneven feel to it, athough it does boast a few really fine tunes..most notably ""Splendid Isolation"" and ""Nobody's In Love This Year ""."
5,Wild Trek & Snow Dog,These are two books that I read when I was in school (w-a-a-a-a-y backwhen). Was pleased to find them at Amazon. Good books that brought backold memories.
4,Fun Book,"Overral ""The Prince and the Pauper"" was an interesting, funny book. I enjoyed the Old English style in which Twain wrote it in, but if you are not a fan of that particular style you my not like the book very much."
4,Inspirational classic,"One of the most persistent themes in American pop and literary culture is the switched identity plot. Movies like Garfield 2, Face-Off, Big Business and Double Dragon have been based on this trick. Where did it all start? Probably with this children's classic by Mark Twain. Set in Renaissance England, it tells the story of two boys who look exactly alike, except one is a prince and the other is a poor boy. The two meet each other, exchange places, and have loads of fun. All ends well as they each regain their proper places with more wisdom and friends than before.The text of the book is readable by most elementary school kids, though the length is quite long for a children's work. The dialogue is English, and might make hard reading the first time around, and the comedy might be dry for those not used to it. But the book is enjoyable and totally appropriate. I highly recommend it."
3,A little cheaply made,"It's was easy to install but the arm is not solid at all. I installed it a few days ago, so we will see."
3,Plastic Flag,"It is a decent flag for the price paid, but if you want a high quality flag that will last a while, i'd say spend a little bit more for some better quality."
1,Errata,"What Carroll and Graf Publishers desperately need is 1. a fact checker and 2. a proof reader. Shameful display of factual errors. With sloppiness of this sort, why would I ever dream of believing the basic (and unbelievable) premise.Yvonne Adler"
4,Basically informative...,"The book gives you a pretty good overview of each phase of a job in residential landscape architecture, and also, what is expected of the landscape architect. At times, however, I felt that the author was trying to fill some space with wordy repetition. It does provide a basic roadmap of a job in this field of work, from start to finish. It also covers standard basic design elements. For that, it's worth the read. I'm not sure it's worth the price."
5,Request for Music Fans,The site where you can get lyrics to the Lilo and Stitch songs is called stlyrics.com. I thought the cd was awesome. I just love Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride.
4,The fun!,"With time, Disney-films have become increasingly cheekier, grown-up and well ... groovier. We've had Hercules, The Emperor's New Groove and Toy Story. Now Lilo and Stitch is obviously a next step in this (r)evolution. No sweeping, dramatic songs in this one. Not one. Instead, you're served a whoopin' dish of rock `n roll!You can't go wrong with a soundtrack like this. Some bits of Elvis here, poppy A*Teens there - as well as excerpts from Alan Silvestri's symphonic film-music. And don't forget the traditional Hawaiian music (thank Silvestri for that too).A most unusual soundtrack to a Disney animated film. A bit short, I must agree. And too bad there're no Enhanced CD extras (the disk-space - and Disney's creativity - is there for that sort of stuff, hint hint). But after each listening, do I leave the room a-swinging? Does it improve my mood? Do I like this album?... my God I know I do!This one gets four stars... just for the excitement of it.Bram Janssen,The Netherlands"
2,the quality is bad...,"The screen quality is not so good, not HD, like watching an old TV set :( I think unofficial stuff are bad and do not deserve to charge you anything."
3,Hard to wind up,This is just okay. It's hard to pull out and wind up for a little guy. Kinda wish I would've gotten a different one.
1,play tape measure,"I was disappointed in this tape measure. It is overly bulky and hard to pull out, would be nice for that age if it had a button for self retracting. Would not recommend this product."
2,Too Hard to Wind Back Up,"I wish I would have read the previous reviews before purchasing! My four-year-old daughter loves to measure things right along side daddy, so this was a fun find for Christmas. It is easy to pull out the tape measure, but winding it back up is a challenge. I would suggest looking for another kid friendly option!"
1,Too difficult for little hands,"I tried to use it before givinng to my 4-yr-old grandson. Big, bulky... I returned it. Very easy to return. I'd rate returning on Amazon a 5 STAR."
3,"Fun, but challenging","My little guy enjoys the concept, but gets frustrated when the tape measure runs out. Rewinding often requires parental assistance, but it is a nice toy to help him join big brother."
1,"My 2 y/o says ""dis for a baby""....","This toy is probably good for a kid who doesn't understand what the tool is, what it does, or what it is for. But my 2 y/o knows what a measuring tape is, and just needed one that wasn't metal that wouldn't cut his hands! This thing is HUGE, and you have to ""wind"" it up to roll the tape back up. He hasn't touched it since the day he got it b/c it doesn't roll up like a real one, and b/c it's so big. He literally looked at it and said ""Ma-ma, dis is for a baby""."
3,not impressed,This was on my little guy's wishlist until we bought it for a friend (it was on his wishlist too!) I was not impressed by the quality. It didn't seem like it would hold up to toddler use for long.
1,Don't buy this,"So annoying ever time my kids pull the tape out they want me to wind it back up. Boring toy, stupid not worth the money"
5,Buddhist-like Mystic Fusion Trance with Flowing Native American Accents,"An excellent cd. It sounds more like a Native American band done right with the intrigue of Tibetan Buddhism than a typical new age cd. There is no hokiness. It trances prettily in a masculine-feminine balanced way- perhaps somewhat more masculine though not meant to mean ""manly"". There are not any songs to skip over. I got tired of it over the years at times, but now it sounds special and is favored again. There are some wonderful exotic moments worth the investment-- trance voices and flute-sounds in danceable rhythms, toned like Enigma or B Tribe slightly but faster-paced and I enjoy it better usually, especially with the emphasis on different spiritualities and personal titles yet not getting into the listener's mind, just being there good."
5,Awesome Crib Set,The Animal Antics Crib Set is beautiful and the colors are great. It washed nicely. The different animals are made of a chenille material and they are adorable! I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Only 1 spray,"Misleading advertising by showing 2 sprays in the picture, you only get one. I could have bought this cheaper in the store."
4,Good . But expensive,"I only bought it online for more because I couldn't find this one in stores.Bit over priced,Its the true old spice. Know what your buying.."
1,Doesn't Smell Anything Like Aqua Reef Deodorant or Body Wash,Simple review. The Old Spice Aqua Reef scented body spray doesn't smell anything like the Aqua Reef deodorant nor the Aqua Reef body wash. Really odd since all of the other respective Red Zone scents offered by Old Spice match.
3,The New Harvard Dictionary of Music,This appears to be comprehensive but is written in detailed terms that one must lookup. It's like using a term to describe the same term. In fairness I am only a student but I rather doubt most students and intermediate level musicians will see much benefit from this volume.
1,Might have been cute in 1993,"Wow, I stumbled on this while looking for the original Zeros. How did these guys not get sued for stealing the name? This is cheesy faux punk/glam drivel. If these purple dudes are still around, I hope people don't think they are going to see The Zeros (original 1976 punk) & end up seeing this train wreck. I'm thinking this is supposed to be sort of a funny/comedy kind of schtick, based on the lyrics & the fact that they are driving a Chevy Vega on the cover of their other record. Doesn't work though. Even when the guitar work is pretty solid on a few songs, the lyrics & singing is painful. Avoid at all costs."
5,Review for Java Concurrency in Practice,"In terms of the concurrency pragramming, this book is explaining more comprehensive concept and programming model of the thread programming. Also, it is good for upgrading to Java JDK 1.5 programming skills.To sum, the author introduces the deeper and well understandable thread theory for Intermediate and advanced java programmers."
5,excellent,"This book is a must-read for anyone working in java with the shared-memory concurrency model. Ideas are very clearly exposed & the new java.util.concurrent package is explained perfectly.If you work in java with threaded code, stop whatever you're doing and read this book, now!"
5,awesome book on concurrency,An awesome book on concurrency that all Java programmers ought to read before embarking on anything more complicated than the primordial Hello World application.
3,Just Another Umbrella,"Getting this for free as part of the Invicta Watch purchase is well worth it. I would not pay or feel that the $45 price as advertised is anything but an advertisement for the Invicta watch. It probably has a value of approximately $10. Not bad for free with a watch purchase, but just another umbrella with advertising on it."
1,This was a rip-off,"If I could select ZERO stars for a rating, I would!!!The MERRICK product is excellent -- it is the VENDOR that stinks! -- If you look at the same product sold here on Amazon from other vendors, the 34 count box sells for less than $35.00 and NOT over $100.00. You can even by them one sausage at a time on AZmazon for less than $1.25 each so why buy it from THIS vendor for 3 times the price!!! I did just that by mistake thinking it was for FOUR boxes of the 34 count and not ONE. BTW, You can buy ONE of these little suasages for less than $2,00 RETAIL at most pet stores.The MERRICK product is GREAT! This vendor is ripping us off. Be wise --- still buy Merricck products on Amazon but NOT from this vendor. I now have to be bothered with ""fighting"" and being hassled in order to get my money back because this vendor has no return policy. What a surprise!!I am LIVID!!!"
5,Powerful Testament to Human-Animal Connection,"Wendy Baker's book is an uplifting story of her own recovery from a riding accident and how she overcomes fear and disability to reconnect with the joy and power of the horse. Wendy has shown how the Lakota Indians have rebuilt the spiritual bridge to their own equestrian roots with parallel stories of healing and strength. I enjoyed getting to know the individuals Wendy profiled, and reading about their courage, as well as hers. The book is informative, well-written, and the photographs are worth the price of the book in themselves."
3,The best of the four solo albums,"Of the four members in Kiss, there's no doubt that Paul Stanley has the best ear for melody and hooks. Although Stanley's solo album is the one with most in common with the traditional Kiss approach and because of that not particularly exciting, it has the best songs on it. The quality of the material is rather high and the album is very even. The hit potential is quite high and songs like ""Tonight you belong to me"", ""Move on"", ""Wouldn't you like to know me?"" and ""Ain't quite right"" would make Desmond Child green of envy. This is the most solid effort of the four solo projects, and I would rate this 3.5 stars!"
3,Comes In 2nd Place,"I'm positive that Ace's solo was the best one of the four and Paul's comes in 2nd and as for Gene and Peter,I would have to say they fight it out for last place because those 2 cds are pretty awful.Probably give Gene 3rd and Peter last."
4,"Great Album, Best of the Solo Efforts","Paul's album is by far the best of the four solo efforts (with all due respect to Ace). Well written songs, good lyrical content along with Paul's operatic voice make for an excellent, listenable and memorable album. Good, melodic lead guitar work by Robert Kulick. My only complaint is that Paul should have done a bit more of the lead guitar work; he's a pretty darn good player in his own right. Athough the single, ""Hold Me, Touch Me"" is the weakest song on the album, it's still a pretty good one nonetheless, especially since it's the one cut that Paul plays lead on. Paul, if somehow you ever read this, and if you ever to another solo effort, let's hear lots more lead work from you! Along with all of your other talents, you're a great player, you deserved to be recognized for it and your fans (that's all of us) deserve to hear it!"
1,not worth it,I gave this as an extra gift to a friend who is mad for blue. She went to wash it and all the blue came off and she now has a clear vase. This is not good quality at all and I've won better items at carnival shill games.
5,Great book!,"This book was very helpful for my spiritual Path. I often post a link to it in Christian and Spiritual forums when people are confused about the conflicts of the age of reason and the past doctrines that simply don't make sense. Kim Michaels did a wonderful job explaining the Spiritual with Science.As for the other review, Kim Michael's personal life has nothing to do with this book. Remember there are two sides to every story. The other review sounds like a smear campaign."
1,More attractive than helpful,"I bought the book because I needed help figuring out what color to paint my house, but it really didn't help me. The book looks good, but what I need is help choosing colors. I returned it."
4,Want a road map of Michigan ?,"As an ex-michigander who frequently travels back home, I like this atlas. If you are looking for things to do on vacation in Michigan buy something else. This is basically a road map (note publication date - newer roads won't be there!). I've even found some driveways on it. I like to take alternate or scenic by-ways between points A and B. ""Top"" bike trails, Hiking, canoeing spots etc. are also mentioned. After years of vacationing in one spot we found some new things to explore with this. If you are a park and hike type explorer this is it. If you want to get off the beaten track you need this. If you're looking for a travel guide, look elsewhere."
5,The only facewash that works!,I have very sensitive skin and whenever I stray from Neutrogena extra gentle I'm sure to break out. It feels like lotion on my skin but does the job to remove the makeup at night and leave me with a fresh palette in the morning. I'm so glad amazon has started to carry it at a good price because it has become harder to find in stores.
3,got frozen,"It is unfair to rate this product because I believe it may have been frozen solid as the package waited on my doorstep for a day or two in Minnesota. I know that Neutrogena makes a great line of products, but for facial cleanser I presently prefer Cetaphil."
2,Trying to be deep..,"This book reads like a script for a TV show or bad movie. While entertaining at times, nothing stands out. The characters are paper thin and the plot is unbelievable. A guy goes from being a nice kid to a complete a-hole with a killer instinct over the course of ten years and then reverts back to a nice person again in a matter of days. The maid helping him has a surprising past that is not believable at all. I kept waiting for a bombshell to be dropped about who she really is and instead it was a dud. The whole time I read this story I kept thinking about the tv show, my name is earl. Not really an original idea. If you like a quick read that require little thought, then go for it."
5,Toy Story review,The toys have shown that they are durable. These were purchased for my younger child as her older boys have loved their Woody from 7 years ago and will not let her play with it. They are designed in such a way to make you happy just to hold them.
1,It was awful,Acting was terrible and I thought there was going to be more nudity but it turned out just to be a s***ty waste of my time.
5,I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"honestly, I don't know why. I am a fan of mostly R&B and pop, definatly not oldies! This CD spoke to me! I completly and totally recomend it!"
2,The best song in the movie is missing from this soundtrack!,"Somebody from Florida asked about the missing song. It's ""Them Changes"" by Buddy Miles, one of the all-time great funk-rock artists of the 60's. He played with Hendrix, Pickett, Ruby and the Romantics, etc. ""Them Changes"" is the best song in the movie, and it's missing from this soundtrack! How could they exclude it?!!! Without ""Them Changes,"" this soundtrack is a 2 (same tired old songs we've heard a 1000 times). With ""Them Changes,"" this soundtrack would have been a 5. Here's my advice: forget this soundtrack and order the CD ""Them Changes"" by Buddy Miles."
4,Doctor Feelgood,Piano Red was one of the best piano and blues singers along with Jimmy Reed as ever come down the pipe.
4,A look at how life has changed in with cars,"I receieved this book as a Christmas gift from a fellow Porsche lover and read while I was heading home back home for the holidays. I am in my late 20's, so I have not reached my ""mid-life crisis"" yet, but I still enjoyed following the tales of Morgan and his thoughts about how the car has influenced our society. I enjoyed his talks while he was in Portland, Oregon. Hearing his own tales on how certain cars throughout his life played a major role in certain cross-roads kept me intrigued. I love Porsches, but I also love the idea of just hitting the road and seeing life outside my little world. As soon as I finished this book, I began ""On The Road"" by Jack Kerouac. So far, I see some similarites."
2,sparks don't agnite,"The CD is in good condition and there is no problem with the product excepts that the CD is boring, discoish and boring. Totally forgetable piece of music."
3,It's Mascara...,"Was looking forward to a better experience. Item works just as well as any other mascara I have tried. That is to say, it isn't a 5 star product, it's just mascara."
4,Excellent debut.,"This is one of those few albums that I took a chance on just because it was cheap. What a score. They're a bit of many things, all of which I like. You could toss them into the ""garage rock"" crowd, but I also hear glam, metal, emo, and some of that old shoegazing fuzz. They put it together pretty well. There's a number of catchy rockers like ""California"", ""Rock n' Roll & Teenage Desperation"", and the cool ""Elekt"". But what impresses me is that they also can lay down some nice ballads, like ""Ways to Kill a Superhero"" and the beautiful ""Ash to Ash"". Overall this is a great record, no matter how much you get it for."
3,Slow heater,"This heater is very slow to heat up. I primarly bought it to help de-ice the windshield in the winter quicker than just the car defroster. The car defroster works almost as fast except for extremely cold days. It really depends on what you are planning to use this heater for. If you have no heater in your car, it's better than nothing. But what can I expect for the price and operating on just your cigarrette lighter plug. Do not buy for just the purpose of quickly defrosting your windshield. I do think it is a little overrated for its ability."
5,"Love, above the reach of time","The illistrations, cover and pictures are outstanding and make this book attractive and interesting without knowing the content.The fictional part of the screenplay adds interest as to what is fictional and what is real. The authors factual addition to the book added interest to those of us who injoy non-fictional history. This is a ""no put down"" book, very compelling story."
3,Good Historical Reference for Students of Hitting,"Although an outdated work as a guide for becoming a good hitter, it is a book which affords one a historical perspective on hitting. Williams' ideas on pitch sleection still offer a hitter an excellent idea of what pitches a hitter should look to hit in certain situations. Not recommended for any new student or coach trying to learn to hit or coach hitting. This book is a good reference for experienced students of hitting trying to understand the revolution in hitting theories and mechanics."
5,Still relevant,"Best parts are the discussion of thinking like a hitter based on the count, and the strike zone chart showing the matrix of baseballs and Ted's batting average of each ball. This thinking can help a player with good skills be a better hitter."
2,much too sophisticated for a 10 year old.,I bought this for my 10 year old grandson. way over his head' better for a serious 18yr.old. Live and learn.
5,Best Dancehall album of the year,"This group is amazing. This is the best dancehall album out there, maybe with the exception of Dutty Rock. These guys flow with the best, and add catchy, modern Jamaica lyrics and CRAZY beats, and you have a 5-star endeavor. Regardless of where she is what she's doing, my wife can't help but shake it. More T.O.K!"
4,Excellent!!,"After searching this cd for many years got hold of this cd after owning the ""Throw it up"" 12"" since 1999 which has a different remix than the one on the album. Good album with undergroung cats featured on this album including O.C & A.G(DITC), O.G.C, Imam Thug (Tragedy Khadafi)and Master Fuol (Rawkus)"
3,"Satisfying, but not completely.","Secrest is a fine writer, although I think her very straightforward style seems a bit pedestrian in the face of her fascinating subject; much like with her Frank Lloyd Wright biography. I wish she had been more attentive to Sondheim's personal life, since his work has been dealt with better elsewhere, and the book really works best when it looks at the man who shapes the artist. A good job, but not as monumental as we Sondheim freaks wished for and needed."
2,DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY CLOYINGLY TIES ITS LOOSE ENDS..,"A reviewer here called this movie a 'vanity piece' of the Douglas clan. That's a bit harsh because many parts of the movie are actually quite endearing and could easily have been just about any family in a big city. The first 10 minutes leave you wishing for something to happen, a wish that unfortunately remains ungranted until the credits roll. Acting wise, it's decent but amounts to little. Younger generation, in particular Rory Culkin as a young kid and Cameron Douglas (Michael Douglas' real-life son) as a wannabe casanova tween, display an easy charm and grace that makes them watchable. I recommend getting a complete picture of the movie through its quicktime trailor, because the actual movie adds very little to that."
3,More than just a film about I.B.S.,"I watched ""Spartacus,"" and I thought, if Spartacus were transported to 1960s America, what kind of kid would he have. I figured he'd be like Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street."" So, I watched that film. Then I noticed Martin Sheen's Union rep is a lot like Spartacus -- he even says the only difference between slaves who built the pyramids and the guys who build skyscrapers is the skyscraper builders had unions. Both films end on a sour note. Afterwards, I thought, Michael D. and his father need to make up or something bad is going to happen. So I checked out ""It Runs in the Family"" to see if there was anything I could do. In this context -- watching two generations of Douglases work out their differences so the third generation of Douglases wouldn't be as screwed up -- my interest was held. The film runs a little long, and I wouldn't recommend it to people not actively trying to deal with their own family issues -- they'll probably get bored."
2,Feels gross,"It worked to get make up off, but left me feeling like I rubbed a bottle of vegetable oil all over my face."
2,hardly removes make up,these pads are the worst! they pull out my lashes and don't remove liner or mascara.
1,Disgustingly oily.,"I normally use the oil-free version of this product but I decided to give this one a try. First of all it took over three weeks to arrive, which is unusual for something coming from Amazon. When I opened it the pads were rough and dry but still somehow soaked with oil. After removing my eye makeup with it there was an oil slick under my eyes that was still there when I woke up the next morning. Over the course of the day my mascara transferred under my eyes until I looked like a raccoon because my skin was so oily, which has never happened before. I tried them for about three days and then just gave up and threw the rest of them away because my whole face was oilier than it had ever been before. Just stick with the oil-free ones."
4,Great Album,"If you like The Carpenters, this is a great album. Every song is good, Karen Carpenter had a wonderful voice and this album showcases her talent wonderfully."
4,Memories of a beautiful voice,It is always nice to remember my teens and twenties in love...listening to the Carpenters. Deja vu. All over again.
1,Nice cover but...,"This was a total disappointment. Not only were several hit singles left off (""There's a Kind of Hush,"" ""Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft,"" ""Solitaire"" and ""Sweet, Sweet Smile""), but all except for ""Close to You"" and ""Touch Me When We're Dancing"" were remixed. Also, once again, the original ""Postman"" wasn't included, which was the Carpenters' biggest internatinal hit.Overall, this is another showcase for another rehashing by Richard Carpenter. If you want the original hit singles you grew up with in the Seventies, don't waste your money on this CD."
3,Great for the Price!,"As a child, I remember my parents listening to The Carpenters. So when I stumbled across this album as a cheap MP3 download, I snapped it up. It's taking me back, and I'm enjoying that. The music is more ""pop-ish"" than I generally prefer, but I've been reminded of just what a great voice Karen had. Too bad she left us so soon."
4,My guilty pleasure,"What was that movie with Chris Farley and David Spade, Tommy Boy?, where Spade heavily disses The Carpenters, then is seen in the next frame singing along and crying to one of their songs.That's probably me. The hard rock, jazz, outlaw country, and classical enthusiast in me sneers at soft pop/rock like this, and the sentimental kid from the 70's LOVES it.I listened to this while truckin' through Oklahoma the other day, and was transported to a kinder, gentler world where Vietnam, school shootings, etc., never happened. OK, complete Disneyland, but still lush, beautiful, sensitive and THOROUGHLY enjoyable music. Maybe not the 70's as they were, but as we would have LIKED THEM TO BE."
3,"nice vest, big fit","I ordered a SMALL, and it was very large on me. Very loose, boxy fit. Nice vest, great pockets. Would have ordered an EXTRA SMALL, but, unfortunately, they don't make it. I generally wear a size 4."
3,Best vest,I was searching for a vest that would fit me without my looking to big and cumbersome. This vest fills the bill for what I was looking for. Plus it is waist length and allows me to reach my pant pockets without a lot of digging and searching for my pocket.
1,Lousy!,I really wonder why Faye wong can be so popular... She cannot sing well enough. It's true that some songs of her are well written but she can't deliver them well enough. She shouldn't use her fake voice too often.This album is a lousy follow-up to her previous self-titled release which had many nice songs.
1,overpriced lollipops/drops with no extra benefit,"If you really want a sour lollipop, go with one that doesn't use marketing tricks to sell their product at inflated prices. Preggie pops are essentially the exact same product as YummyEarth lollipops, which are organic and are made in sour flavors as well. The only difference is, they are sold as just lollipops (not a morning sickness cure) and thus are a fraction of the cost. In regards to effectiveness, these drops unfortunately did nothing for me. The only thing they did do was make my mouth so raw it bled, but I was still throwing up and sick all day. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
1,Not that good,I heard about this item from a friend. She personally hadnt tried it but some one she knew had. The Candy dosnt taste good and it didnt help relieve any morning sickness at all. The flavors were wierd. I couldnt even stand the smell. The sour flavors were too sour to stand. The thought behind this product has good intentions but it didnt work for me personally.
4,Does its job!,"My currently pregnant wife, who is suffering quite badly with ""morning sickness"", has received much help from these pops. They actually seem to be effective, though I've no idea how!Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because she is thoroughly displeased with some of the flavors.I just ordered more for her, but with specific flavors."
2,Eh don't really help.,They taste good but don't really help so much with the sickness... sprite works better at settling a queezy stomach. They may help someone with very very mild sickness... but prolly not.
1,Beware - NOT the original artists........,"I purchase this CD because it advertised the ""Original Artists"" ""Original Hits"".........It is not as advertised. None of the songs are by the original artists and nothing on the jewel case advises you of that. The song list on the back has all of the original artists names after the song as if they are singing on the recording. They are not. If you are looking for the original artists........look elsewhere. I did not purchase this from Borders."
3,Doesn't work well on all paper types,I think I might have gotten a defective punch. It works okay on thin paper that you would use in your printer - but give it anything thicker and it will tear rather than cut. If you buy this punch I suggest you test it right away on different types of paper so if it is defective you can return it. The punch I have also has a tendency to jam and remain stuck in the down position.
4,"Lightweight Wagner, musical but not much oomph","As the previous reviewer notes, Julia Varady's voice is fresh and appealing here despite her age, and Seiffert is a musical Wagnerian tenor, though by no means gifted with even half the vocal heft needed for Siegfried or Tristan. As recorded, he sounds even a bit light for Lohengrin and Tannhauser, but his tone is very appealing and blends lyrically with Varady--no artificial beefing up a la Windgassen.Fischer-Dieskau seems to view Wagner as a lightweight composer, also, and he takes pains to avoid any heaviness or pomposity--as a result, everything moves along very pleasantly, if not exactly with any suggestion of heroism. On another day I oculd easily rate this CD three stars."
4,Excelente Chaqueta,"El material esta perfecto, transpirable y completamente impermeable. Excelente producto. solo le falta que le coloquen un bolsillo tipo Napoleón."
4,Great view of nude guys receiving a massage,"I can create my own ""erotic"" value from watching a nude male receive a massage. Great opportunity to see these nude models. Great variety! It's all about the art of the nude male."
3,Another Krunk Review,Was about a boy who is on the oregon trail heading for oregon. His journey has tradgedy and triump. Its a quick read and its very suspensful.
1,Too many inconceivable coincidences.,"The book started off with a bang & Kleenex needed. It then fizzled. There were too many inconceivable coincidences. And how long does it take for 2 people to realize they love each other! Surely their actions could speak louder than words even if they couldn't say them. I mean my gosh how many times did they have to save each other. To me it was ridiculousness & I had difficulty finishing it. Don't waste your time on this. There are too many really good romance novels out there. I have nothing against this author. One of my favorite books was by her, ""Once Upon a Time."""
5,Ooka the Judge,"Ooka the Judge was a real judge who tried cases with fairness and justice long ago in Japan. These timeless stories capitvate children's interest and pique their imaginations. There are at least 10 stories by I.G. Edmonds about this Japanese judge - you should really read them all. The stories are great springboards to lively discussions of fairness and justice, and honor. This book belongs in everyone family's library!!"
3,Disco Hits vol 6 : Various Artists,"Most cuts are reproduced here in their edited 7"" versions. However there are 4 full-length extended mixes..these are: Bob McGilpin ""Superstar"", D.C.La Rue ""Cathedrals"", St Tropez ""One more minute"" and the Ritchie Family ""Life is Music""... Probably worth purchasing for these tracks alone.."
3,This filter kit does not include 17 holes seal (Molded Rubber),"I bought this filter thinking that it includes a 17 holes rubber seal, but It came without it. My ford taurus 97 gl's Transmission pan has AX4N metric name(AX4S) as it is in this url http://www.taurusclub.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=57372Now I had to look for part number FK67800D that is a Molded Rubber which is used together with p/n 67800D (Green Seal filter - AX4S Exc. SHO/95-Up) (F6DZ-7A098A)"
2,From an avid player,"If you're looking for a strategy guide to Legend of Dragoon, look elsewhere. There was little editing. I found many spelling errors and punctuation errors. Not only that but I found some items they put down didn't exist at all. Take ""broad spear"" for example. Now, in that area there is a spear and a broad sword, but no broad spear. To me this was a rushed guide and not worth the buy."
5,Bosch GL2.5,Installed this heater for my wife's vanity sink. Installation is straightforward. Good capacity for bathroom sink use. Water comes out warm in just 2 or 3 seconds. Very satisfied with purchase.
4,Not a full tank of hot water,"I have just intsalled the Bosch 2.5 gallon water heater under my kitchen sink, and it is quite easy to install and has great instructions. I am a little dissapointed that the heater does not give you a full 2.5 gallons of water at the temperature set. I initially left the thermostat at the factory setting, but this gives you only a few seconds of hot water, not more than a quart. I have had to set the temperature almost to the hottest setting to get enough hot water to run the dishwasher or wash dishes in the basin. Has anyone else had this problem?Otherwise, we love the instant hot water and still recommend this unit. We installed it with flexible hoses so we can easily take it out to do the yearly cleaning of the element. Will let you know in a year if that goes well.Richard in North Carolina"
3,Alternate solution for HW at a distance,"Just an FYI - you may want to consider installing a recirculation pump(<$200). My farthest HW tap is 100 feet from my HW tank and I have virtually instant HW. The pump is installed above your HW tank and is easy to install. It constantly circulates the HW through the system so it is always available. I live in FL, so I don't know if that makes a difference, but it may be worth looking into."
2,Incomplete,"Although this work is interesting in that it attempts to flesh out the details of the lives of the Emperor and Empress of Mexico, it's lack of bibliography and any kind of footnotes or end notes makes it very incomplete. Additionally, I was very disappointed to see that the author (perhaps because of his royal connections) failed to even mention the rather horrible manner in which the incapacitated Empress Charlotte's personal fortune was completely looted by her brother King Leopold II to fund his personal posession of the Congo (later taken over by the Belgian State and turned into a Belgian colony)."
4,"Last American Native to ""emerge""","A reissure of an interesting book. (Maybe a tad repetitious.)This chronicles in the USA a type of ""Stone-Age"" Native American who, dying of hunger stumbles into ""modern"" America. How he sees things and what fascinates him, interests us,"
3,"comprehensive, but","..most of the plates are in black and white and not of a very high definition. i also wished for more detail plates of the major works.still, though, a decent value for the price."
5,She sings opera with the clarinet beautifully,"I have had this CD for 3 years, and listened to it many, many times at home or on my long drive in the car. I have never felt tired of enjoying the pieces on this CD, and got more of her recordings on other CDs instead.Sabine Meyer is a true master of the clarinet. In this recording of opera pieces, she demonstrated how well the clarinet could sing opera beautifully. My favorite pieces in this CD include Bassi's ""Fantaisie brillante on Verdi's `Rigoletto'"", Danzi's ""Variations on `Là Ci Darem la Mano'"", and Rossini's ""Theme and Variations"".This is definitely a clarinet CD to have."
3,Love the book,The book describes the differences between siblings. I like it because the twins get into arguments like me and my brother. I am not alone
5,"Great, and NOT JUST for the symphony","I'm not going to try to add anything to the other reviewers on that score.But the ""filler"" is also very good. If you're not familiar with this more playful side of Shostakovich, hear him kick up his heels in the Jazz Suite No. 1. Then hear a haunting waltz from Jazz Suite No. 2, something that sounds like it would have played well just before ""the lights went out"" in August 1914."
4,"Before I started using this foot cream, I ...","Before I started using this foot cream, I was using one with an AHA. But this one is much better. The consistency and texture reminded me of Corn Huskers Lotion. For four nights in a row, I applied it at bedtime and put socks over my feet. I was very surprised at how well it worked. My heels are very dry and cracked and this really helped. I noticed a difference after just one night of use. It also seems to work for a long time, even after I took my socks off in the morning. It takes a while to soak into the skin but once it does, the finish isn't greasy -- it's almost powdery feeling. The package said that I need to use only a dab, but I had to use quite a bit more than that. All in all, I'm very pleased with the product and would buy it in the future--but I wish it came in a bigger tube."
2,its good,"yo this album is great. it is a mix of punk and ska, and it sounds really good. some of the songs suck, but others were really cool. i suggest this album to anyone."
5,Executed to Perfection...,"For those who gave this film a poor review, I suggest you make time and watch it again. It provides a much needed message to both young girls (and boys) and would be pedophiles alike...think your actions through and know the possible consequences prior to moving forward.Yes! The film was a bit drawn out, but that's reality. Sometimes, communication goes on between a victim and the preditor for a long period of time, before opportunity presents itself. Which only adds to the down play of the dangers the youths of today face, when interacting with complete strangers over the internet. Everyone feels as though it could happen to them, when in reality...everyone is at risk!!I would (and have) recommended this film to others."
3,Two wrongs don't equal right,"Read the reviews and know what you are getting into before you watch this movie. I didn't and was surprised at the little gem my wife brought home for family ""entertainment."" The idea for the plot is a little predictable, the outcome not surprising but the acting is very good and the saving point of this film. The main characters are both odious. The supposed heroine was just as dispicable as the pedophile. My sons and I cringed through the scenes involving one sicko do the unthinkable to another sicko.....ouch!My wife was the only one who seemed to enjoy this sadistic payback.If I had to pick the movie, knowing what I know now I think I'd pass. It is creepy and a very disturbing movie all the way around. Not for the faint of heart or real young (preteen)children.The retribution scene is a bit much.I give this three creeps up."
1,Boring!,Not so much disturbing as just plain old boring! Listening to Haley go on an on and on and him panting and breathing heaving for 90 minutes was a bit much. Truly one of the most drab movies I have ever seen.
1,Quick Summary of Hard Candy,">you're a pedophile>no i'm not>yes you are>ok maybe i am>i'm going to cut your genitals off>you are?>lol jk>ok>but seriously, hang yourself>ok*Theater erupts in applause*"
1,worthless hype for a worthless movie,"so yeah, basically when I came into my friend's house and saw that he was putting in a movie, I figured hey, they're gonna watch a movie, how pleasant, but unfortunately it was this movie, while thankfully I was on his comp most of the time and wasn't really listening to it, I would come into the movie for parts and just sit there and think to myself ""so what?"", I was basically just bored through the entire movie that I saw, bored enough to stop watching and get on my friend's comp, ya? It's entriely annoying that even though most, if not all of Lionsgate films are like this and either bore the hell out of you or keep you utterly entertained throughout, but uhh, unfortunately I'd rather watch Hostel than this movie frankly."
4,not as good as i thought,"it was great, i dnt deny it... but it was not CREEPY nor was SCARY... i was waiting for something else... whatever...i enjoyed it anyways... and i was also expecting a good ending for that good movie..."
4,Beautifully Disturbing,"Hard Candy is extremely disturbing on many levels; the premise, the dialogue, the violence, very awkward situations. The acting is brilliant, Ellen Page is perfect at not showing any emotion. The movie is also shot well with extreme close ups, and fantastic use of vivid color. Essentially there are only two actors and mostly dialogue but the movie goes by quickly."
4,"Surprise, Surprise, Surprise",This movie never lost my attention! The way the movie progressed was a surprise. A must see. Worth the time spent to watch it.
4,Fallen Angel meets Extremities meets Swimming with Sharks,"What is basically a very odd little two person diatribe is very well acted and very compelling if you care to get immersed in such subject matter. I sure many would prefer to avoid a story centered on pedophilia. This is not Fallen Angel, though. In fact, it's the antithesis.Ellen Page's facial features lend much credibility to the idea the she is fourteen but her spiel is a bit too mature. It's fun to watch anyway. Patrick Wilson is adequately slimy as the possible perv.It's a squirmy, unpleasant ride but sometimes that's just what the doctor ordered."
3,O.K.,"I small girl, that is strong enough to lift a man not once but twice...? I'm thinking hummmmm, it was O.K.."
5,Great Performance!,"Ellen Page's performance in this movie is the greatest I've ever seen by a person 18 or younger. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Her performance is better than the movie but makes it a five-star film. This is not a horror movie--it's a thriller. Ellen Page is going to be one of the great ones, looks like."
2,Little Information About Mutts,"I was looking for a book that would give detailed information about judging a mutt's pet potential. Only 31 pages in the book discuss how to judge what personality traits the dog may have based on it's appearance. I also wanted information on how to judge how big that puppy will get and this book didn't cover that. Probably because that's a tough job, which is why I was looking for help. This book provided little useful information on choosing your mutt. It left me thinking that maybe we'll have to go with a purebreed after all.On a positive note, if you don't know how to take care of a dog, this book is full of information on basic dog care."
5,One Too Many Chocolat,"I picked up this CD in Utsunomiya, Japan about 3 years ago. It has a variety of tunes - all of which have great instrumentation. A few tunes bring goosebumps to your arms. I now have all of their CDs, and have turned many of my friends on to this group."
3,A little rough,"Although these are small and easy to use, I found the blades to be a bit too rough for my skin. Be sure to soap your face before using & use a lotion afterwards. I don't think I'd buy them again."
5,Hooked,I'm Hooked on this game I played a demo and that was it for me I had to get it. This is one of my favorite games and every one who plays it on my system loves it too so what are you waiting for buy it.
4,Better than expected ...,"I really was surprised by quality of this movie. The acting was outstanding (not surprising considering the very talented cast), and the plot was better than expected - the pace was tight, and though the story was somewhat predictable, there were still some unexpected twists. Well worth buying."
2,Scarecrow costume,"The quality is not the best on this costume... And the head part of the costume that is connected to the shirt, is not flesh color as shown in the picture... It is orange."
4,Ken Burns Explains Complicated Stuff,"A good history and political science overview of the Congress, but pretty out of date by now. I'd love to see someone do an update. This one is PBS, but maybe on of the other educational TV networks may want to take a stab at it. Does PBS ever do updates?In any case, it is informative and easy to follow."
5,Great Filter with Perfect Fit,"I bought this air filter and oil filter for my 2006 Porsche Cayenne and couldn't be happier. I noticed the difference right away! I had the dealer install both when I got my oil changed so can't speak of installing myself but probably wouldn't be too difficult if you're mechanically inclined at all. The quality is high, the warranty is unbeatable, and it does what it says. I'm convinced and wouldn't buy anything else if given the choice. The price is hard to beat on Amazon as well."
2,"Should be called ""CA Bay Area Bride Guide""","This guide has a TON of ideas for weddings in the CA Bay Area/wine country, but VERY slim on any other places in Northern California. Great if you are a SF Bride, but bad if you are above Napa."
3,An old classic,"None of the splendor of The Fragile, but with all of the intensity of The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine is a key part of the collection of any NIN fan. The lyrics are much more coherent and emotional than you'll find in any other NIN tracks, and at times Reznor seems to take his emotions a little too seriously (a couple of the tracks get almost goofy), but this is a great selection from Reznor's formative years.Probably not for mass appeal, although there are some pretty good tracks, but a NIN fan can't help but love it. If you've never bought NIN before, don't start here. But you'll get here in time."
5,"nine inch nails,nine inch nails",i love nine inch nails. there the best band out there right now. any nine inch nails cd is worth buying. but i recomend this one for the first time listener because it will prepare you for the world of Trent Reznors awsome band that is Nine Inch Nails.
5,A wonderful CD from the even more wonderful Trent Reznor!,"Alright, I have a confession to make. I'm an Anne Rice fan. I bought this CD because, and only because, I wanted to hear ""The Only Time,"" aka ""The Armand and Daniel Song."" So, I listened to ""The Only Time."" I loved it! In fact, I liked it so much that I even took the time to listen to the rest of the CD. Guess what? I loved it! (Big shock, huh?) I now own several other NIN recordings, but Pretty Hate Machine is still my favorite NIN recording, and one of my favorite CD's of all time. If you like alternative or industrial music, this CD is perfect for you. Go buy it. Once you listen to it, you'll wonder why you didn't buy it sooner."
3,NINE INCH NO-NO,"It's hard to be impressed by this album if one had been exposed to the pioneers in the industrial field, like Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, Psychic TV and early Chris & Cosey. Pretty Hate Machine is accessible enough to appeal to New Order and Depeche Mode fans but breaks no new ground. You get (almost) heavy metal guitar, pounding rhythms and state-of-the-art samples of snatches of Jane's Addiction, Prince, Public Enemy and This Mortal Coil, among others. The lyrics are all desperation, anger and confusion, as on Head Like A Hole, Something I Can Never Have and Terrible Lie. Every so often Reznor approaches brilliance in a smattering of song over here or in a particularly succulent segment of synth noise over there. But his harshly monotonous voice over ten tracks kinda leaves you with an empty and vaguely uneasy feeling that you've been listening to heavy metal with a disco beat."
1,Desperate attempt for the record company to squeeze whatever they can,"From Trent Reznor's word himself:""I wouldn't buy this one. This has NOT been remastered and has only been released because a clause in a boring contract said they could (so of course they did).""So there you go. You should buy this one instead:Pretty Hate Machine: 2010 Remasteras Trent actually remastered and had Rob Sheridan redesign the cover."
3,ok,"some of the songs are good, (something i can never have, head like a hole, terrible lie, and sin) the rest are ridiculous. it's just sounds and stupid lyrics, i.e. ""i guess i'm not the only boy for you"" ringfinger and sanctified are the worst NIN songs ever. down in it is pretty stupid, this doesn't even sound good when you're drunk"
3,el Inicio de NIN,"Este disco es el inicio de lo que seria la banda ams grande de los 90s: NINTal ves al los nuevos en el planeta NIN, no se les haga un gran disco, pero bueno, era 1989 ! este disco es para los iniciados en el planeta NIN, para los verdaderos FANS, una combinacion de Rock con Dance , muy, muuy efectiva"
1,Staying far away from this.,"Just a ploy from the label to make a quick buck on just a cheap re-release not authorized by Trent Reznor. This morning, Reznor himself, tweeted to avoid this re-release. Buy the remastered copy by Trent or a vintage copy if you collect."
4,.,"great album, you can hear the two influences, skinny puppy and prince, almost a perfect blend of the two, but look up skinny puppy for something amazing"
2,NIN and Skinny Puppy?,"NIN did tour with Skinny Puppy efore PHM was released, but it didn't work out and Skinny Puppy is listed as one of NIN's influences in the allmusic guide. As for PHM itself, I really don't care much for this album. The lyrics get annoying after a few listens(""head like a hole, black as your soul, blah, blah"") and it seems a bit dated IMO compared to other albums released at the time, like Ministry's Land of Rape and Honey and Skinny Puppy's Too Dark Park. I don't even consider it ""industrial"", more like abrasive synthpop. I suppose NIN fans will love it, but I've moved on to other ""industrial"" bands, Front Line Assembly , Pig, and Wumpscut."
4,"An incredible album, emotionally and musically","Well, I can start off by saying that NIN is my favorite band... Oh yes. This is Trent's first album, and it's very incredible. The lyrics are raw and emotional, not very metaphoric, almost like diary entries. The music is 80's synth pop cheese - Not that that's a bad thing. In fact, it's a very good thing! This album rocks me, and it will probably rock you too if you like this type of music."
4,very good listen,"overall NIN, is probably my favorite group, but i feel this is the album with the least ability to envoke a reaction. its very easy to listen to the entire cd (it's catchy), and takes almost no ""getting used to"".....it's almost a bit too ""popish"". but that DOESN'T mean that you shouldn't buy this, as this is a great album to own, and has some of their coolest songs in it. i particularly like ""down in it"", ""head like a hole"", ""kinda i want to"", and ""thats what i get"". what's clear though, (from listening to it), is that he developed his true (lyrical, and musical genius), a little later in his career."
1,not pleasaaant,"I found it painful to the ears, spineless, and a waste of time to listen to. pathetic, boring, and yet just plain bad."
1,Garth brookes,"This is possibly the worst CD i have ev er bought. I am so disappointed that i feel like commiting suicide - it's that pish! Don't buy this, buy Britney Spears!"
2,Ushering in a new age of banality...,"Firstly, Nine inch Pales by comparison have nothing whatsoever to do with 'industrial'. 'industrial' is dark ambient, it nary has choruses, hooks etc. Secondly, this is well arranged synthpop, it give this a 3/3 for music, although some of it is awfully dated. But the trite, awful lyrics. Oh dear. Found a weak spot. These sort of lyrics have inspired mildly depressed 14 year olds to dress silly and swear at attractive, functional people unlike myself. This is a soul-less man baring all, and revealing a void, filled with total stupid sloganeering, affected self-induced depression, mild despair amplified. Mr Reznor was a very popular, functional, artistic, gets dates type of person at high-school, there's some background for you.-1 for the lyrics. So that's 1-2."
3,off to a rough start,Yes this cd is raw and unpolished but it's not the NIN we all have fallen in love with this lacks the creativity of following cds. But it is still an okay album. If you can get it about half the price that it is usually asked for it.
4,This one is a keeper in my cd collection no doutbt,"When I threw those headphones on my head, pressed play immidiately the first track hit me, then the second, and the third, etc... This albulm kind of grows on you and you can't just throw it on your home system, walkman whatever you listen to it on and go on doing chores watching tv reading a book what have you, you kind of need to appreciate the careful arrangement of the instruments that are laid out on the albulm be it guitars, drums, synths, d/m. I think I like this albulm........no.......yes I love this albulm. For the england fan with no email address and is on a mission try U.N.K.L.E. Another star studded albulm that will have you growing goosebumps OVER the goosebumps you currently have from listening to D.I.V. the Contino Sessions."
4,I'm Impressed!,"I just got this tribute album, I have to say overall alot of the bands could have a better sounding recording, I really liked Fury's version of Dog Faced God's...it rocked! The track I would have to say is the best is ""Nightmare"" by Habeas Corpus..I see it was recorded by James Murphy and I have to say it is definitely the Best and heaviest on this cd...but why is it the last track on the disc? Should of been First! Overall - Great Album."
3,A cluttered stragity game,"I am a Jane's fan but this one missed the mark. The interface is sloppy, cluttered and control is confusing. The graphics are not bad but this one is un-fixable no matter how many patches are made. There are problems starting the game and the online patch didn't fix any of my problems. There has to be a better Naval combat sim out there."
4,"Overall, It's pretty good","Having owned several Jane's games. I know that some of them can be pretty overwhelming. Fleet Command is one of the better games that has come from the Jane's series. One, is that there is no big book to read. Two, It combines overall nice graphics of the ships and aircraft. While still adding some complex situations. If you are into ships and aircraft of the Navy. Go get it! (But just make sure that you have a pretty nice system to run it on...)"
5,One thing to say- It works!,"When our new house was being designed, we knew the kitchen would be a long way from the other use points of hot water. Our previous house had a similar situation, and waiting for hot water was always an irritation, as well as a waste of water. We asked the builder what he would suggest. He recommended against a constantly circulating ""hotel hot water"" system, as it was expensive to install, and there would be a lot of energy loss from all that hot water being circulated through loops of pipes. He suggested this instead. It is in the crawl space, hung from the joists directly under the kitchen sink, and fed by the hot water line from the larger hot water heater about 40 feet away. It works perfectly. Hot water in less than two seconds, and we never run out. I now recommend this to everyone. We have been using it for a year, and have had no problems."
4,The Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser Pump is ...,The Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser Pump is really quite a nice product. I also liked the convenience of the pump. It left my skin clean and soft overall. The lather is very different than the bar soap I'm accustomed to. I'll probably purchase it if it isn't overly expensive. A very gentle product.
4,A harrowing tale of human survival and will.,Rowe is the embodiment of the human spirit. His grit and guts pave the way for an outstanding tale of bravery. His thick headed captors strengthen his resolve throughout the book before he finally reaches home.
4,A suprisingly good book,"I truly enjoyed this book. There were lots of twists to it, and I felt there was always something happening. There wasn't a bunch of unnesscessary descriptions. I really like Emily's style of writing. It isn't the victorian style, and it is basically an easy read. I don't like reading a lot of the 19th century books like Pride and Prejudice because the woman are all proper, but this story could have just as well been written today. Some of the characters horrified me, but unlike a lot people I did find a few characters that I could accept. I say give this book a chance."
5,A classic love story,"A Classic. I have read it many times, but I will read it again many times. An enduring love story."
1,I like books written by authors I like,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
2,Disturbing,"I was expecting something in the vein of Jane Eyre when I began to read this book. I was sorely disappointed. True, the violent love between Heathcliff and Catherine is heartwrenching; however, the most difficult part of this novel for me was that there was no character that was lovable, or sympathetic. Just when I started to think that Heathcliff was not so bad after all, he would commit another shocking deed of horrific cruelty. Catherine was just annoying. I also found the plot hard to follow, what with a third person telling the story, and then swinging back to first person narrative. If you want a really powerful, uplifting love story, read Jane Eyre, or The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery."
3,Well-written but depressing and hard to follow,"This was not an enjoyable book for me to read. It was depressing, dark and hard to follow. Yet the mood it creates is full of depth and is told in a mesmerizing way. This is a book that everyone feels they must read and it was really hard for me to finish, but finish it I did. If I could I would have given this book 3.5/5 stars for the excellent use of language and talent for create a setting."
4,Strange; Brilliant,Four stars. The personage of Mr. Lockwood makes a slightly unsatisfactory and unnecessary narrator and is my only qualm. The remainder of the story is staggeringly brilliant; I've encountered nothing like it before.
3,Intrigued,I didn't think I would finish reading it but my curiosity would allow me to quit. The movie version of Wuthering Heights was deceptive in regards characteristics and behavior of the characters. To love someone can be a beautiful experience but to misuse it like Heathcliff did was horrible and mean.
5,"Wuthering Heights, still a delight to read.","Although I read Wuthering Heights years ago, I enjoyed rereading it. When I was younger I thought Heathcliff was just plain mean. Now that I am older, I understand loss, and frustration a little better and the book took on new meaning for me. I think everyone should read this book at least once, and if like me you read it years ago, it is time to reread it."
3,Wuthering Heights - Bed Book,"3 out of 5, only because it's a bed book. The book itself is in good shape, and it arrived quickly. My gripe is that I didn't see it explained anywhere that it is a Bed book, which means the book reads horizontally not vertically. Not a big deal, but irritating none the less."
4,"poignant, good","My friend complained bitterly to me how horrible this book was, and curious, I decided to pick up a copy. I was impressed by Bronte's work.. I like how she illustrates the passion and love evident between Cathy and Heathcliff... it is one of the most moving storylines I've read. It's a good classic, and although it's tragic, there are glimpses of happiness here and there in the novel, and the novel ends on a peaceful, concluding note.However, the Yorkshire accent nearly killed me... it was hard to read--I skipped the Yorkshire dialogues almost completely. Also I felt like strangling Cathy and Heathcliff... it was all perfect, but then she had to go do her thing... Yes, I know this was the whole point of the story--conflict--but still, it could have been happier. The novel was very touching and I was left speechless as I quietly closed the book, because Ms. Bronte knows how to describe two people in fervent (though at times.. rampant?) love and how it will endure the tests of time."
5,Wuthering heights,This book is spell binding. It takes you on a journey of love and passion as well as jealousy and hatred. She writes about human nature.
4,Wuthering Heights,Wuthering Heights was a very good book although there seemed to be some typos that could have been avoided when editing.
3,Definitely not the greatest love story.,Surprised I even bothered to finish this one. Found the characters annoying. Really surprised I finished this on. I kept reading hoping it would get better. This is the book version of the movie THE FOUNTAIN. The only redeeming quality of that movie is the score.
4,Good classic,"This is another book I had to read for Literature by Women. This is another good classic that everyone should read. There's a lot of agression between the characters, but that's what makes it interesting."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,I read this book probably every other year and seem to find something new in it each time. It's a good book but I always wish at some time when I read it the book will have a different ending for the characters.
5,MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE BOOK.,"I read this book when I was 15 or16, I think, out of curiosity, I had heard so much about it. Three years later it is still my favourite book. I lost track of the number of times I had read it. To me it is the greatest love story ever written. At first, I felt it strange that the hero of this story should be an unbelievably evil villian, but I later understtod that Heathcliff was not your conventional love-sick melodramatic hero, and how Emily Bronte could make this character appear deserving of sympathy and even a little admiration, is nothing short of literary genuis. I had come to that conclusion years ago- you had to love a man who could love like that. I felt his character was more rounded than any character I've known. Some people might find the book depressing, gloomy, even a bit morbid-no doubt it is, to a cerain extent.I found it to be the most realistic, passionate and romantic love story I've ever read or will read."
3,I don't find it to be a love story,"I've read this several times. It is a good read, but it's more of a story about how NOT to treat people. It at least makes you appreciate your own life after reading it, but it is very depressing. It all ends well with the characters, but not one of my favorite classic novels."
2,SLOW to receive book!,I bought this book and it took almost 3 weeks to get to me 2 states away. Should not have taken that long.
1,WRONG INFORMATION,I received the incorrect copy. The image presented is not what I received. It was a false advertisement and I am throughly disappointed in this experience.
3,Decent,"Wuthering Heights doesn't have the creativity or vividness as that can be found in Jane Eyre. With just a bit more passion, or shall I say obsession, this book will touch the hearts of teenage females more than Jane Eyre. This book was rather a bit too sappy and it felt like you just HAD to give the characters some sympathy. For poker-faced die hard pessimistic readers, this isn't one you'll want to try."
1,A poor printing,"This printing is rife with errors. It is also a bit disturbing that the cover looks more like Psycho house than any description of Wuthering Heights; clearly the artist who created the cover has never read the book. By all means, read this gothic classic, but pay a bit more and get a decent printing (even the one with the ""Stephenie Meyers cover"" would be preferable to this sorry edition)."
2,I can't like characters I don't believe.,"I am aware that this is not a novel meant to put a smile on your face or make you think of flowers and rainbows etc. But I was unable to get any enjoyment out of this book because the characters are so completely ridiculous in their courses of actions. Granted, the theme of the book is how hatred, jealousy, envy, and the like can overcome a person's soul, but she took it too far. The overblown ""love"" between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."
2,Wuthering Heights,I am still trying to read this book. I have no idea what is going on. Not an interesting book to me.
3,Not that great,"This novel was some what ridiculous. The main characters were childish and I actually ended up liking the neighbors better - which I think was the objective. The ending was the only part that I actually enjoyed - don't worry, I won't give it away. I'll just say that it is a relief from the chaos apparent through out the novel. The mood uf the entire novel is dark and despondent...it was just too gloomy for me. I read it first when I was 17 - after reading so many other well written classics by great authors - I have to say that this one does not compare."
3,Wuthering Heights,"Having never read this very old novel that is often required reading in school, I took the plunge and almost drowned in it before its completion. I found it to be depressing with its tale of abuse and relationship problems coupled with old English wording. Nevertheless, I had to know the ending so persevered to the end. Now ready for something lighter and enjoyable."
1,Very overrated,"I'm actually 17, not 13, but I don't have a credit card so I can't submit normally...Anyways, this is my review:To be perfectly honest, I found this novel to be very overrated. I didn't enjoy this book at all, and to be honest, I don't really understand why it has been referred to as a ""classic"" when it has, at best, a flimsy plot and several of the characters are little more than one-dimensional stereotypes, not unlike characters in a modern-day soap opera.I'll admit, it does have it's strong points at times, such as the profound symbolism used throughout the book and the imaginative descriptions of moments such as Mr. Lockwoods dream about the late Catherine, but personally, I found it to be overly melodramatic, and at times, tedious. I was glad when I finally finished reading it."
4,Half of a Great Book,"I was loathing this book, hating the heroine. Catherine Earnshaw is the most hateful and irritating woman in English Literature. Then, thankfully, around mid-point, Catherine Earnshaw does the reader a favor and dies, leaving the book to Heathcliff. The second half of the book, in which Heathcliff returns to exact his revenge, is one of the most gripping tales I have read."
3,Wuthering Heights is a decent book about confused lovers.,"Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_ is a decent book about a man named Heathcliff who did not get to marry the girl he loved, therefore he dedicated his life to making everyone else as miserable as he was. This book had a few unrealistic parts and was not always practical, but it did have a pretty good plot line. I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other. DWright"
3,It was decent.,"I really don't see what has made Wuthering Heights a ""classic."" I'll admit Cathy and Heathcliff's love was probably the strongest love I've ever read about. However the hate and darkness in the book pretty much drowns out the love story. Most of Heathcliff's hate is derived from Catherine's love but most of his actions are very severe. I believe the reason he acts like he does after Catherine's death is because he is without his ""soul."" Death pretty much occupied the whole book. Almost everyone died and it caused people to act in strange ways. As strong as Cathy and Heathcliff's love was, I believe that Bronte's obsession with death and revenge drowned out this love. Again I pose the question, Why on earth is this book a ""classic""?"
4,Interesting,This book was hard to read. It is just amazing to think that a woman that died at 30 (just 2 years after this book was written) could come up with something like this. It makes you wonder what kind of life she had.I enjoyed the book but it took me several tries and quite a while to get through it.A classic worth reading but not easy.
4,"Much more complex than a ""romance novel...""","and better than any Hollywood production. One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted ""proper behavior"" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator. She is the most likeable character in the story but not very realistic."
1,Hated It,"Seriously hated every page of this book. Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities. It must have read like absolute trash in the time period it was written, and still does today. I fail to see how anybody could find this story romantic. If a man told me that this book epitomizes his idea of romance, I would run for the hills and never look back. I honestly can't waste any more time on this book, even to write a lengthier review."
2,hate story.,i thought this was suppose to be one of the greatest love stories ever told but after finishing the book i was left in shock. I can't believe that their would be such an evil person like Heathcliff. I liked the book but just not what i expected.
5,Wow!,"I just got my shipment. I am loving it! They are great!!! Nice weight, elegant, and comfortable. No sharp edges at all. What a great price! Service for 12, serving pieces and a caddy! Also, they are 18/10 stainless. I can't stop praising this purchase!Buy them now!!"
5,Caddy included!,One does not need to order a caddy for the silverware since it is included in the 65 piece flatware set. Silverware -- great value!
3,Be careful,"I used these to assemble some outdoor furniture made of poplar. I had to be very careful not to sheer head off when using cordless screw gun. I eventully changed to 1/4"" impact to have better control of seating head. Advertised as no PRE-DRILLING required but it definetly required pilot hole in poplar. Some screws had blocked drive holes."
3,Cool bed 2 versus 3,"Last summer I purchased the cool bed 2 for my great dane. It worked beautifully but alas such a big dog, he had it punctured by the end of the hot weather. It was worth the investment, just wish it had been a little more durable.This year I upgraded to the cool bed 3, or so I thought. I even added the linen cover to help protect it from puntures. This bed doesn't seem to cool at all and my dog is not seeking it out this year. It was considerably more expensive than the cool bed 2 and I am pretty disappointed with the new one. If you want to try this product I strongly suggest trying the cool bed 2 first."
3,Pretty good,"The moisturizer is pretty good. I have very tempermental skin: if I don't have enough moisture, my skin dries out, and then I have flare ups. If I over moisturize: my face does the same thing. This was my first time trying this product, and I purchased it based on other's reviews. It didn't make my skin any softer, but it did a good job of moisturizing. It's not a perfect fit for me. I've recently switched to Clean & Clear Dual Moisturizer, and it's a winner. It has the perfect amount of moisture, but also contains acne fighting ingredients that help my skin. The Neutrogena made my face shiny within a few hours, which is also a concern for me because again, depending on the moisturizer--my face creates more oils.If you have tempermental skin, problems with slight breakouts, and want to avoid having oily skin--try the Clean & Clear Dual Moisturizer. I've gotten my sister hooked on it too, and she never breaks out."
5,Acne Prone Skin's Dream,"Let me tell you, my skin is the most acne-prone, sensitive skin there is. Plus around my mouth and on my nose it's pretty dry while my forehead and cheeks are super oily. This stuff absorbs fast, keeps my skin moisturizes ALL DAY and I haven't gotten on pimple from this stuff. I highly recommend it."
2,Jodi,"The movie 17 Again i received in a timely manner which I was very pleased about, but it was a christmas gift for my daughter so we didin't watch the movie until Christmas Day. The seller said it was in good condition but as we were playing the movie it seems to have a place in between commericals that it just stops and I have to hit fast foward for it to go on. I guess I should of watched it before I wrapped it or I would of returned it. Thanks"
4,17 Again DVD review,"First off let me say that I love the movie. Zac Efron does a great job. The DVD is the disappointment. While I has the widescreen and full screen versions on the same disc, it is totally absent of bonus material. No trailer, deleted scenes, making of, nothing. The Bluray has a little but not a lot. So to wrap it up: good movie to watch but don't expect to learn anything about the behind the scenes aspect of it."
2,"get outta here, matthew perry.","Should've casted Jason Bateman as the older Mike O'Donnel. Perry and Efron looking NOTHING alike ruins it for me.And Vanilla Ice didn't break through until 1990. The unfunny comedian playing the coach dropped a reference during a time taking place in 89. And the movie is chalk full of continuity errors. But even still, none of those factors seem to bother me as much as the feeling of Efron stepping off the set just as Perry is stepping on."
1,Disapointing,The movie is fine.....the other's that we tried to cancel have been charged to my credit card. This was a big mess and I don't think I will ever be able to clear it up. Never again....Syl
2,whoa- this is not a kids movie,"I watched this movie on a plane. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDRENOR TEENAGERS. If you have a home where you are trying to educate yourchildren to be decent adults DO NOT LET THEM WATCH THIS MOVIE. (ADULTS,THOUGH, WILL FIND THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS)"
3,Familiar Themes Recycled,"The plot elements are shamelessly stolen from ""Big"", ""Back to the Future"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and any number of other films. But the writers do a fairly good job of making it seem sort of fresh. Zac Efron is significantly too old for the role he plays. (Zac Efron too old? How time flies!). On balance, it's entertaining."
1,THIS SUCKS!,"Some people say it goes far, but I got a monster truck that goes 40 miles per hour, and can go a couple thousand feet in range, this thing goes like 100 feet, maybe!!!"
3,Dune 2000,"Okay...listen up...if you already have Dune 2, don't bother buying this game. It's the SAME game...a little better graphics...but most true strategy gamers don't care too much about the graphics. I'm not saying this game is bad...it's just the exact same game as Dune 2."
4,Awesome,"Beautiful CD, with fantastic Jazz original compilations. Lots of energy at the same time very smooth."
5,Like you've never seen!,Soo many rainbows! I bought 3 of these and hung them all together in my window. I enjoy making them swirl in different directions for rainbows everywhere! Would make a great present
5,pure enjoyment,"There's a reason Mavis and this CD won four W.C. Handy Awards...it is a terrific disc. The songs are uplifting and inspiring. The production is immaculate. The background musicianship is superb. And, of course, there is that strong, angelic voice. No reason to look further...buy this CD."
4,Good Addition to Tivoli Radios,"I bought the Tivoli Top-Firing speaker so that I could enjoy stereo sound from myTivoli Model Satellite Table Radio (Sirius Satellite Radio / AM / FM ). The speaker is housed in a nice wood cabinet that exactly matches the Tivoli radio.The speaker has bass that its a bit on the boxy side. It's not difficult to listen to and some people might prefer the sound. I would have preferred something with a little cleaner bottom--although I did find that the location of the speaker does help a bit. Keeping it a fair distance from walls and shelving helped immensely.Overall, this is a very good product."
4,"The Iranian ""Little Miss Sunshine""","A miraculously entertaining representation of the suffocating nature of modern Iran, Low Heights follows the story of one disillusioned family who is absolutely determined to leave their homeland behind any cost necessary. Although it is at times a tense thriller, the heart of the movie lies in the humorous quirks and loving connections between each family-member.I certainly recommend this movie to anyone who lives for great dialogue and character development."
5,Couldn't be more pleased.,I've been using this product for over 5 years. I work in the entertainment industry and constantly get compliments from makeup artists about my skin tone. This product works great for me.
5,Mariah is simpply the best,"Mariah looks her best on this tour DVD. And she is going from strength to strength. It's just a pity there wasn't more special features and background scenes and interviews, etc...I saw her live in concert on her Charmbracelet Tour and it was amazing. I really hope that all her other videos that are unreleased on DVD will soon be availabel to buy. And I hope she comes out with a new Tour DVD with new songs from her ""Mimi"" album - It's excellent - she's brilliant - what more can I say...Norman"
4,I REALLY LIKED IT!!!,"This was a really good video, and I loved the clothes she wore!! :c) I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU MARIAH, YOU ARE MY INSPIRATION AND THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / Sweden's #1 Mariah fan Lisa."
5,Awesome! When's the next one?,"I wouldn't give the 5-star so easily, but it cannot be denied that this is one of my favorite DVDs. Yes, it was ""cut"" -- not a complete continuous concert -- but that takes nothing from it.I was impressed -- yes impressed -- by Mariah's lack of showmanship. It isolated her talent, which is her incredible voice (along with some great songwriting). It made me appreciate the later CD, The Education of Mimi even more. What a difference between the singsong stuff on this DVD, versus the bold stuff on Mimi. When do we get a more recent concert, Mimi??? I'll buy it!Additionally, for those of you with kids, this is a completely family-friendly DVD, including the ""Camp Mariah"" segment. Mom, Dad and kids can sit in the living room on a Saturday night and enjoy the heck out of this DVD. The part where Mariah enters stage-left during One Sweet Day is an inspiring moment.Buy it. I'm a ""Mimi"" fan for life."
5,Before things went downhill for Mimi.,"Fantasy - Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden was her last great concert. After her Daydream album, Mimi's voice got more strained and her image started to change, she just wasn't the same woman I adored as a youngster. Mariah's concert on this particular DVD is pretty much flawless, great performances include: Fantasy, Open Arms, Dreamlover, Without You, Vison of Love, and Always Be My Baby. I highly recommend this gem of a purchase, enjoy!"
2,Didn't Work for Me,"This product didn't work on my hair. I have fine, blond hair and it looked very oily on my hair. It seemed to lie on top of my hair like an oily coating. I used it only twice and then didn't use it again.Fekkai Advanced Brilliant Glossing Sheer Shine Mist"
5,Auto Parts,"I received the correct part, works perfect, no problems at all. I will purchase my auto-parts here again, good price too."
4,Fine Product so far,"Additional straps, etc. are needed to supplement the supplied Velcro connections, secure the bag, and keep it from sliding off the rack, especially when loaded. The various attachment points make this modification pretty easy. The bag itself is well laid out and a good compromise between a small carrier or basket and some of the larger packs that can get in the way and are meant for multi-day trips. With the fold-out panniers, a fair amount of groceries can be carried. The panniers should be used together, since one alone exerts enough force to pull the bag towards that size. The reflective fabric strips are worthwhile for traffic. This is a very good bag for the price. The illustration appears to be the somewhat smaller Toploader 1."
3,A decent bag...,"This is a decent bag....What I don't like about it is that the bottom won't stay flat and more importantly, it's hard to strap onto my rack on my Greenspeed GT5 Trike. I had to put a bungee cord around it to keep it from rocking side-to-side. It may indeed work better for others than it has for me, so far."
3,CANADA RAP REPRESENTING,"The Rascalz coming straight out of van city, representing for all of canada. This is a pionering album and it showcases the rascalz skills and diversity. If you want something totaly different than gangsta rap, this is definatly a good choice. You will be seeing more and more of the Rascalz as they continue thier invasion of the u.s markets."
4,affordable hot water,"We bought this unit for Dog Grooming. The two weeks that we used it so far it works great, only had one time that we ran out of hot water and not sure why. Like everything you buy, if you think about what your needs are and do your purchases according to that in most cases you will be happy with the item you bought. And we are happy with the Ariston 6+."
1,Never got to use the product,"Received the first product but the round cut outs from the manufacturer were not cut correct to accept the pressure relief valve and the stopper plug. Replaement sent quickly; however, it was damaged in shipping. Returned for refund.Customer very good but manuafacter and shipping damange an issue."
2,Sabona Magnetic Bracelet,"Really not at all worth the price I paid.It's pretty ""cheezy"" looking, and it has a real cheap, and VERY hard to open & close, clasp.Also, I haven't seen (felt) any positive results from the whole magnetic bracelet hoopla."
5,:),"This book is so much fun, if you haven't read it you should. It's full of interesting hands and interesting people, not the least of whom is Zia himself. You may not learn much of direct value to your game, but you'll certainly laugh! ""Bridge My Way"" is a great reminder that there's a lot more to this game than memorizing bids and percentage plays."
4,"Zia Mahmood, the entertainer","This book is a delightful read. Zia is an addict of Bridge. Not just addicted, but obsessed. His book illustrates the familiar experience that we all can relate to of becoming obsessed with a past time.Zia plays with flair, table presence, and takes full advantage of the human element contained in Bridge. He shows us just how much is involved when playing Bridge -- much more than just the cards in front of us. Indeed, there is much to be said about the psychology of card play and Zia is the master card psychologist."
3,Buy it but realize the limitations,"Interesting game but it comes nowhere near in realism to racing legends. I drive road atlanta about 12 times year in a 99 Porsche Carrera and my best a gap, so much for the realism. All in all, you're getting more than you're money's worth. I just wish the tracks were more realistic"
3,"Good for painting, horrible to clean it up","Bought this to stain two small decks. It was on special and I thought it would make the job easier. Wish they would have put the instructions on the outside of the package. It comes with a 2-year warranty, but you almost damage the pad & stick it trying to remove them from the packaging along with the instructions. Is simple enough to use for application. Would be worth the price if the work area was larger than 300 square feet.Was appalled at the steps to clean it. If you're willing to take the time to clean it, all the power to you! That would take longer than my whole staining job and would be messier, too! Since I bought mine on the cheap and wouldn't need it for another 5 years, I tossed it. I'm going back to good old brushes (long handled, if necessary). They're cheaper and easier to clean."
2,This product went on smoothly and had a ...,"This product went on smoothly and had a light, pleasant scent. However, its coverage was so light that I couldn't see any difference after applying it. It's too expensive to use as a moisturizer. Also, I'd prefer a higher SPF than six."
1,Oil Change Over Simplified,"The oil must be removed through the oil drain to properly evacuate the contaminated oil from the crank case. And the oil filter must be replaced to prevent contamination of the new oil.Maybe you'll find this product wonderful and a cost-effective alternative, what do you do with the oil syphoned from the engine? A small but important cost of the oil change at a garage is for disposal of the oil."
4,Remote oil change system,Great system. Clear installation instructions made relocation of the oil filter very easy. A person should not have any problems relocating the filter cartridge as all required installation components are included in the kit. No more crawling around under your vehicle.Trans-Dapt 1122 Oil Filter Relocation Kit
3,Raising Poultry the Modern Way,"It seems to be an imformative book, but it doesn't define the different terms so that a beginner can understand what he's talking about. What is the chicken's vent or shank in plain language? Why does he assume I would know what culling is? What is a waddle? Just a few of the terms not defined and frequently not explained well."
3,"Good movie, I received the movie complete and ok","Good movie, I received the movie complete and ok. has a lot of trailers, I Wished That I had Spanish subtitles. But it is good is like. I wished that I had Spanish subtitles"
1,Lost my Evo due to this case,"First let me say the leather case is excellent quality and exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately the belt clip does not function correctly which caused me to lose a brand new Evo within a week of purchase. The clip has a screw which is supposed to lock in place and be released with finger pressure on a button at the top of the clip. This is the part that was wholly non-functional. Most of the time when I push the button, I could not get the clip to release no matter how hard I pulled on it. Then it appearently just fell out of this same clip (the clip was still attached to my belt) with virtually no pressure while I was walking across a parking lot. If you buy this product make sure your phone is insured."
4,Great for small jobs,"Perfect for tackling the fallen limbs from our last ice storm, and a lot easier than fighting with a balky two-cycle engine. Probably not powerful enough if you want to reenact an episode of ""Ax Men,"" or if you're trying to clear-cut the north 40, but just right for typical home use.The manual doesn't recommend an extension cord longer than 50 feet, which is pretty short. I'm often using a heavy-duty 100-footer with no apparent problems, however. But if the trees you need to get at are more than 100 feet from your house, you need a gas-powered chain saw."
3,performance of chain saw,"i purchased the Poulan Pro chain saw via Amazon.com 3/01/11 and it worked GREAT for a short time,then it stoped working at all,it would not power up.i received a warranty replacement without any problem.they only required the serial # and a portion of the power cord. the replacement failed in the same manner after the first brief use.won't power up/ dead unit ???i really like the saw and how it works WHEN IT WORKS !i've lost faith in this model and would be satisfied with an alternate design moder or even a TESTED TRUE SAME MODEL. serial # 10334D MAYBE THIS IS JUST A PART OF A 'BAD RUN' IN MANUFACTURE"
4,"Poulan 18"" electric chain saw",Good saw with enough power for work at home sawing up branches and trees that have broken or fallen around the property.
2,Chain Saw Broken Upon Receipt,"I was going to buy an electric chain saw at my local Lowe's. But they increased the price on the one I wanted by $10 [to $100]- so I decided to order one from Amazon. I had it shipped via UPS ground. Well, I guess that UPS dropped or threw it like in the Christmas video [on TV]. When I took it out of the box, the chain was real loose. I thought, well, maybe that's the way that they normally send them. Then, the chain would not tighten. I took off the bar clamp, and the ""bar adjusting pin"" fell off into my hand. I called the Poulan help line - and they are going to send me a new pin. But, he didn't apologize. I guess that he thought I was lying. Anyway, the point is that it should work right out of the box [after you add the bar oil of course].I was thinking about buying a 3-D LG TV from Amazon. But after this, I wonder if it would arrive in pieces.As for the chain chaw, I guess it would be a better item to buy from your local store."
1,It's a lemon.,"It's a lemon. Plugged it in right out of the box, and nothing happened. I guess you get what you pay for. Sending ith back for a refund."
3,Power Source,"I was excited about having an electric chainsaw since I have had great success with an electric rototiller, however the 50 foot maximum extension cord use outlined in the instruction book for this saw is a big limitation."
1,I thought new meant new,"Bought this as a present for my husband. Unfortunately, when he opened it we discovered that somebody had already gotten to it first. What was sold to me as a new chainsaw was covered in scratches and scrapes. The previous user hadn't even bothered to clean it off before repackaging it, because it was covered in sawdust!Maybe it was one of the other reviewers' lemon chainsaws resold to me, or maybe it was just somebody who figured they could get ""free"" use of a chainsaw by ordering one and quickly returning it. All I know is that somebody should really check these things before sending them out. This one's going back."
4,Great 4HP chainsaw for $90,"As long as you can use it within extension cord reach, this is a great tool. the chain oiler is very good - the chain is always nice and wet without spraying oil, which is exactly the way I like it. And, of course with electric, there's no gas mixing and start up problems, and the saw is considerably quieter and lighter than a comparable 2-cycle powered tool. But, keep in mind, this is not a toy -- lighter saws can kickback easier, but on the otherhand they are easier to control as well.Regarding the extension cord, I was worried that 4HP (4HP = 2984W = 27A @ 110V) would draw a lot of current. But I've had no problem using my regular old orange 14ga 100' outdoor extension cord. It seems to work just fine, and doesn't get warm even after an extended duty cycle. The saw only draws full power under extreme motor loading situations -- like if the chain is binding or dull or something...."
1,Arrived with defective oil pump,"Saw arrived quickly, and worked well for a couple of 3 - 4"" diameter limbs that came down in the yard during the last snowstorm. I noticed after 15 minutes or so that the oil level had not changed, and that the chain appeared dry. I removed the bar and checked the oil holes (outlets for the oil pump to discharge oil onto the bar/chain) and no oil was present. Will be returning to Amazon shortly, which is unfortunate because for the cost and size it seemed like a fairly competent little saw."
4,Good for my first electric,"I've always used a gas powered Homelite so I was a little wary of an electric, but the convenience factor took over--I never run out of gas, I never have to pull a starter (my Homelite's starter cord kept coming out). Surprisingly the Poulan is heavier than my old Homelite, which is why I only gave 4 stars (plus, I really need to be aware of where my extension cord is so I don't cut it in half). Otherwise it is great--cuts well, acts like a regular chainsaw. I did buy from Amazon rather than a discounter, private party, or refurbisher because some of the other reviewers indicated that their saws just quit working at some point. Amazon has a great return policy. I'm knocking on wood but, so far, it's working great!"
1,Don't buy this saw from Amazon,"I originally bought this saw 11/2006 and they said delivery would be around 12/2006. Then they said it would be another month to deliver it, so I changed the address to deliver. Amazon ended up canceling my order in 1/2007. So I bought it again on 1/2007 and it was supposed to be delivered on 2/2007. Then Amazon wanted to extend again another month which would make it 3/2007, which I approved via email. When my dad didn't receive it 3/2007, I logged in to my account and Amazon extended it another month without notifying me! This was a Christmas present and this is unacceptable.I'm sure it is a great saw. It is a customer reports best buy. Just buy it somewhere else."
5,Really Great!,"We bought this model based on the reviews for it and have been very pleased. We first used it to cut down 3 thick pussy willow trees. It did great. Since our tree guy was there to chip everything up for us we had him take the stumps down to ground level, as it would have taken us quite a while with this saw. Then we used it to cut down 5 young paulownia trees - now these are very lightweight, kind of like bamboo. We were able to cut them right down to the ground and then checker'cut the stumps to take them down further. The chain came off twice on the paulownias, but it was probably due to our trying to use it to pry a little.."
5,"After 5 years, a great chainsaw","After 5 years of service, a great saw. 4hp is plenty of power for the small tree or two that needs to come down on my wooded lot every year. It has handled a couple of larger jobs as well. And all the benefits of an electric -- no gas/oil mix, or wondering if the thing is going to start after a winter on the shelf."
5,Great saw!,"This electric chain saw has worked great for me. It's the only chain saw I've ever owned, so I have nothing to compare it to, but its cuts cleanly, feels balanced, and has good safety features. I'm fully satisfied."
2,Hate to do this to a Smith & Wesson product,"Other reviews are right..The knife is okay, but the scabbard is a little less than useless. Put knife in, turn over, watch your toes....falls right out. Will not do for diving. Need knife and it fell out on entry. Not a great product, there are much better selections on here."
4,Good first exposure to Nigerian highlife music.,"After listening to this CD once or twice, you will find yourself humming several tunes on this excellent compiliation from the late Celestine Ukwu (died in a car accident in 1976). Although not familiar with this type of music, I enjoyed the relaxing, diverse performances. Lots of different instruments and styles represented. Some similarities with ""island"" music (Caribbean, even Fijian). But it's definitely it's own, unique, Nigerian style. Will buy more from this artist if it becomes available in CD format."
1,I HATE this recording!,"This is the WORST recording of Tosca you can buy! I like Maria Callas, but this was not a role for her! She screams the entire part and just sounds UGLY! Gobbi as Scarpia is very boring! Di Stafano is o.k. on this recording. If you want the BEST AND ONLY TOSCA GET THE KARAJAN VERSION WITH PRICE, TADDEI AND DI STAFANO! Price sounds like a proud woman, and Di Stafano sounds incredible. Taddei will sind chills upon you as Scarpia. This is the best version, NOT the Callas one. I don't know why so many people like it. It has nothing. The orchestra you can hardly enjoy. Karajan lets you hear every great note Puccini wrote without over doing it. Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY from this recording of one of my favorite opera's."
5,"Eh, what's the former review about?","Honestly I came here to buy some of Maria Callas' greatest recordings because some of my CDs with her are worn out and reading the reviews, man, the former guy has to be nuts! Titling his review ""Bad"" and then not writing about the recording at all? What's this? A joke? If it is, then it's not a good one. Weird how Callas brings out the best and the worst in some people. Also I wonder about those who hate her so much... Hell, I cannot stand Britney Spears, so I don't bother listening to her, let alone review her ""songs"". My advice to those who hate her is a quote from Callas: ""Those who do not like my voice shouldn't listen to me"". Perfect and simple. And those who do love Callas' voice can listen to her and enjoy it. As I do and as many others do. This Tosca is absolutely superb. I love it, it's my favourite opera-recording."
5,A great cat fantasy!,"Tailchaser's Song is one of the best books I have ever read! It creates an entire world, not just a story. It's full of cat folklore, stories, and even some words (there is a glossary in the back). There is action, too, and plenty of it. The descriptions of the Hearteater's underground realm (he's evil) are a bit haunting. You will find yourself not being able to stop reading-I stayed up until 2am reading it the first day I had it :-). It *is* long, and detailed, but not in a boring way. I'd recommend in for fantasy fans of young adult age or older (younger kids will find it too long). However, people who don't like cats, longer books, or fantasy will probably dislike it. >^..^<"
5,One of the best fantasy novels--up there with Tolkien!,"I just read this wonderful book on the heels of Gabriel King's new novel, ""The Wild Road"", which I really loved. This one was truly special as well, and there are certainly parallels one can draw between the two. The idea of the quest, the journey from innocence to experience, the coming of age of the main character in each novel-- very well done. The characters themselves were quite completely realized, too--although I think that Gabriel King managed to pull this off a bit better, through the use of really interesting , often humorous dialogue which certainly revealed each individual character. I loved the cat language Tad Williams created, and the way he enables the reader to truly see the world through a cat's sensibilities. (e.g. distance always is referred to in ""jumps."") As with ""The Wild Road,"" I felt hungry for a sequel to this remarkable book!"
4,Interesting story,"I enjoyed most of this book, it was well written until the ending, it wasn't satisfying to me, seemed rushed with what happened at the island and kinda left me going why?"
4,the METAL CLIP at the back of it,"I bought it for my husband as a gift coz his part-of-a-wallet wallet was getting old. He doesn't carry a lot of cash, you can fold a few bills inside it, but don't expect to carry cash in it. It's got enough pockets for 8 cards, plus a see through pocket for ID. He was looking for a slim one that wouldn't bother him in the back or front pocket. This one would've been perfect if it hadn't had the clip at the back of it coz if he puts it in the back pocket it's hard to sit on. He's had it for over a year now and he's still using it."
2,Rust on a new wallet??,"Plain and simple, i bought this wallet with money clip brand new. When it arrived, the money clip on the outside of the wallet had rust on it. Rust on it! on a brand new wallet. I'm still using my old wallet."
3,Too many cooks confuse the broth,"In the context of the series, the term con-fusion applies to the addition of one substance to another. At any rate, there is no way to sum up this mixture of calculus and alchemy in less than ten pages without confusing the reader..."
2,How does this book get the reviews it has?,"The characters are pretty much the sames ones in the cyrptonomicon which was an excellent book. This book is not excellent or even good. Boring and offering little story to latch onto. I suggest skipping.I am a Stephenson fan in general. I have read the Diamond Age twice, snow crash and cryptonomicon, and a few of his other titles. This one is a skip in my ranking though."
4,"this ain't about the, ahem, wankery people!","in a word: awesome. in a couple of other words, if you are expecting a rock guitarist's album with a turntableist thrown in as window dressing, you will surely be mistaken.if you are looking for an album that is nearly always interesting, never boring, and is sometimes quite funny, you should pick up ""front end lifter"".this is the surprise of the year for me. the things that these two cats can do with their instruments is amazing."
3,good,"I love both Living Color and DJ Logic. And when Vernon Reid worked on DJ Logic's albums, like Anomly, true magic took place.But where those albums took old school blues and bogaloo and modernized the forms, this is more about the beats. It is like Reid and Logic are trying to make modern dance music, and conceptually, there is nothing wrong with this.It just feels that these two major talents are working beneath their capacity here. There are too many beats and not enough stomp. Too much dance and not enough music. In their attempt to work with a modern form, they dilute their true abilities.It is not that they are not good enough for pure dance music. It is that pure dance music is not good enough for them.Nice idea, but this is boring."
1,Dung,"I understand this book has been around a while and that Rule has gotten considerably better since it first came out years ago. Doesn't matter -- after this one, I won't go near her. If you like your true crime complete with graphically drawn-out scenes of torture and murder that not only should disgust any civilized reader but could easily arouse a child rapist, then by all means, let this book be seen on your coffee table."
5,Fables for Developing Skeptical,"Wow...a text book for Psychology courses that I couldn't put down...as a Clinician at a public Mental Health Centre, I was completely 'pulled in' to the stories. I wish I had this kind of book at Graduate school. This book takes the theoretical and puts it right into the day to day everyday practice of clinicians. It challenged my assumptions, beliefs and made me re-think different cases. What a great addition to psychology courses - I'm surprised we didn't have this kind of book at Graduate school. I really made me think, and when I supervise new clinicans, I'll use this book. Great book...."
5,A complete overview of the question,"The third edition of this book offers an accurate, up-to-date and illustrated analysis of all major aspects of contemporary Australian cities (their evolution, their population, the changing patterns of segregation, etc.). Aimed firstly at students, it may be read by anyone interested in ""Down under"" cities."
5,Wonderful knife,"I have 2 of these knives and a few others from the four star II series. They are all amazing. I have used ceramic knives and those are about as sharp, but they don't have the weight and durability this knife has. Other knives don't compare. Beside ceramic knives all other knives are dull compared to this one. I would happily pay $200 for this knife after having used it for more than a year. I hone them regularly with the honing steel to keep them feeling sharp. After using one knife daily for 1 year I bought a second one. The new one was just as sharp as my year old knife. I expect to have these knives for at least 20 years."
5,The turning point in the thought of Sartre,"The Transcendence of the Ego is Sartre's refutation and response to the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and his idea that a transcendental ego stands behind consciousness. Reading Being and Nothingness is tremendously aided by this short work, and the thought inside is tremendously exciting, because Sartre refutes solipsism and finally brings consciousness outside into the world. This book is highly recommended to those interested in Existentialist Philosophy."
4,Not my first choice...,"I can't get her Tosca out of my head when I listen...In this 1956 recording, Callas's voice has hardened slightly, exhibiting a certain weariness. IMHO, her voice isn't supple enough to embody the frail young girl with the ""delicate white hands."" In the end, that vocal weariness proved to be a big distraction for me, prompting me to preview other recordings.Although Callas slays dramatically in the later acts, I'd rather sacrifice all that glory for a bit of aesthetic purity and realism. And so the Callas becomes my trusty second choice for Boheme. My first choice of course would then be the Bjorling/De Los Angeles because Freni and Gheorghiu also distract me vocally."
3,Mixed emotions,"I once watched this before it was ""edited"" and it was a wonderful series. However they have really butchered it. The ""editing"" job is just awful. It chops it off in the strangest places and leaves you hanging all the time. It is choppy and hard to follow. I am really disappointed because it was a great series and I wanted my children to see it. We are watching it, but even my children are asking why scenes just end abruptly and why they are having a hard time following the story line.Please, it at all possible bring this back in it's entirety. With DVD you won't need a huge package like you did with VHS. This is really worth watching as it originally was."
1,Not what it seems,"This movie has a good title and catches the eye of a believer intersted in seeing the portrayal of the history of the LORD JESUS' church but this movie is not what it seems. It portrays more of history about early Roman conflicts and more time about fictional characters and romantic relationship developements then church. I'd say about a fifth of this movie is church and about a tenth is Scripture. My testimony is ""a waste of money""."
3,"Interesting book, yet could've been better","The book is interesting, especially for the comments that come with each picture. However, I wish there would have been more pictures of the downtown and midtown areas (differents angles, different buildings,...). Still worth the buy for anyone interested in the fascinating city."
3,I Enjoy Her Complete Novels Much More,"Carol Shields is an amazingly talented author and her books amaze me. I am a huge fan of ""The Stone Diaries"" and I personally think it's one of the best novels of our time, but I must confess that I don't enjoy her work in short stories. I think that her talent is better suited for novels and I certainly think she deserves a world of praise for her books. But, again I didn't really like this one as much. I found it fragmented and hard to follow. It was lackluster and I was really hoping for more. Sadly, I can't rave about this book as much I would have liked."
3,A paragon of mediocrity,"I recently finished reading Carol Shields' short story collection, Dressing Up for the Carnival. I'm a big fan of Carol Shields, having enjoyed Larry's Party, The Stone Diaries, even adding Swann to my wicked Top Five list - but this one didn't hit the spot.Although the stories were charming and well-written, they weren't engrossing. I need to be EN-GROSSED! Instead I felt like I was wading through the bad stuff (I use the term ""bad"" for effect only) to get to the good. Some real gems here, but not a stellar collection.Somewhat recommended - that is, to fans, and not just the casual passerby."
3,Could be better,"My son LOVES ""Click, Clack, Moo"" so much that we have it memorized. I thought ""Giggle, Giggle, Quack"" would be a fun change of pace--not so. My son is only 2 1/2 so maybe he'll like it more in time. In Click, Clack, Moo there are phrases that are repeated and he picked up on those immediately. This isn't the case in Giggle, Giggle, Quack. It is a cute kids story, however, my son can't ""help"" me read it because there are no repeating phrases for him to remember, therefore it's not as interesting to him. We'll put this one on the shelf for a while and see what happens in another 6 months or so."
3,"At least rates one 'giggle, quack'","Good. But not as good as its predecessor Click, Clack, Moo(Cows that Type). An enjoyable read, but pickup the tale of the typewriter first and foremost."
3,Doesn't measure up,"Giggle, Giggle Quack is good, but that is a disappointment considering how high Cronin set the bar with Click, Clack, Moo. Lewin's artwork in this sequel is just as fun and interesting, but the story just isn't as clever."
1,No Book No Explanation,"Placed the order in Nov. but never got the book. After one month, I wrote to the seller to check it out, then I got a refund without any explanation. I need the book for my kid's school project and the seller messed it up. How can we trust the seller any more?"
3,Just OK,I had to reference other books- Lonely Planet France had more to add- and funny how the two books have different opinions on some things (like which store has better chocolate?) And don't plan to use the map on this one- its miniscule. The only advantage is- its small and easy to lug around versus other travel books.
5,Short and sweet,"Love the book. Has all the vital information in a small package complete with fold out maps, pictures and to-the-point, succinct descriptions. This book and series is perfect for a cursory overview of Paris.Also, I love the cover image.....which was shot by yours truly. [...]"
5,atmosphere - color and light!,"I received this book as a gift, having never heard of the architects or their work. After reading the book I was amazed by the quality of the work, and the ideas presented. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone thinking about hiring an architect, or building a house. Wonderful! Inspiring!!!"
3,Not as good as his first album,"While the music on this album does distinctly sound like Ferry Corsten's, it doesn't meet the quality that his first album had. The first few tracks, which are my favorite, don't really seem to go anywhere, i.e. you have reached the peak of the song in the first thirty seconds. As the album progresses, the songs get worse and worse. Corsten starts leaning towards more sample based music in the last part of the CD, and many of the samples are ones I have heard before from other musicians such as Chemical Brothers or the Prodigy. Despite all that though, it's still an okay album, and if you really love Ferry Corsten, you will still probably enjoy this album at least a little bit."
5,The greatest cello concerto,"In my view, this concerto is greater than Dvorak's. And this recording is very special. This CD helped break me out of my 'all Mozart' mode several years ago. Now I own a good deal of Elgar's works. I think the orchestration in 'Sea Pictures' is extraordinary. A CD to treasure."
1,Read With Me DVD - too slow to respond,"I purchased this for my 5 and 3 yr old daughters - it took some patience to set up, but finally we were ready to play. Unfortunately, when playing the games on it and you press the buttons to answer the questions, it takes A LONG time for the program to respond - my daughter was very agitated with the controller and the fact that it was just sitting there - then FINALLY after 25 seconds, it responded by saying ""Correct"" - way too much patience expected for a 5 yr old. Fisher Price told me that is just how it works - we are sending it back to them for a voucher for other FP products..."
3,Be prepared for a long set-up process...,Our five year old has enjoyed this toy so far...after it took an hour to complete the remote and DVD set-up. Be prepared if you have a common DVD brand like Sony and you are forced to go through the manual set-up and enter multiple codes. I would recommend this toy for younger children who are just starting to read. Our daughter is already reading in Pre-K and she has found some of the options and questions in the story too easy.
2,Not what I thought it was.,"My four year old loves to read and is getting interested in game systems used on the t.v. I thought this would be an ideal mix but was very disappointed. First I had a lot of trouble getting the system programed to my DVD player. However, I talked with two different people on the Fisher-Price hotline who were very helpful. Also the wait to speak to someone was not very long. My son loved the game but the biggest draw back was the controller HAS to be pointed straight at the DVD for the system to work. For older children this might be ok but it was very hard for my son, I ended up being the one to push the button he wanted pushed. This was not fun. We have now taken the game back and gotten a different system."
5,Homeschoolers LOVE educational toys/gifts!,My daughters (turned 5 & 6) received this toy as a gift for their birthdays from our best friends and they LOVE it. We homeschool and we love educational toys that do not get played with a few times and then put in a pile that clutters the bedroom. This is well worth the money especially [...]. WE ALL LOVE IT!!
1,Karen/Joe,"My sister bought this for our twins at our request for Christmas. We took two back that were defective and after waiting in line and trying to set up with two different DVD players in our house, gave up and would not recommend wasting the money on or trips to anyone! Our children were disappointed as well!"
2,Think twice before buying!,"I had difficulty setting up the system. The directions for the set up were very easy to follow, but either my remote or the Read with Me DVD remote was not picking up the proper signals, and it took about 6 attempts to finally get it all programmed. Once we finally got it working, the Read with Me DVD remote did not work well (had to push buttons several times to get the desired action) and the CD skipped or repeated questions. Very frustrating! However, my three year old son did enjoy watching the story being told on TV. He just couldn't operate the remote very well...not because he didn't understand but because of the poor quality of the product. I think it is a piece of junk and will not buy more videos!"
5,Clasicos Latinos by Leo Marini,It is a compilation of all the favourite and most known latin songs which are hard to find nowadays. Leo Marini is a great favourite in Latin Anerica and delivers an exceptional performance on this CD
3,Good book.,A little difficult to understand having such little knowledge of the events before reading this book. I may have to read again to ge the full benefit. I read this book because JFK had read and recommended it from what I have read.
2,Am I missing something?,"Now, I must admit that I'm not a hard-core history buff. I'm usually knee-deep in novels or biographies. So, when I read all the reviews about how this book flowed like a novel...or that readers just couldn't put the book down, I thought it would be perfect. My knowledge of WWI was limited to everything that I hadn't forgotten from High School History classes (which wasn't much), and I was eager fill this gap in my knowledge-base.Well... I have to warn potential readers that this book definitely doesn't flow with excitement. I fear that many of these reviews are from readers that are simply proud of the fact that they have read an ""intellectual"" book.If any readers have any other suggestions on a history of WWI, I would be grateful. Perhaps a narrative?"
4,An interesting read,"For the history buff, this encapsulates the onset of World War One. One of many books written about this slaughter."
3,"Callas, an over-rated soprano","Nicolai Gedda as B.F Pinkerton is brilliant, a true showman in the role and a brilliant tenor full-stop. Callas on the other was not good at Cio-Cio San, in fact she was terrible.It truly shows the difference between the two lead roles vocal technique and capability, in 'Vogliatemi bene', Gedda was brilliant note perfect and tone perfect, Callas was terrible she shrieked most of her way through the duet and sang a shrill top C at the end which compared with Gedda's masterful top C was a piece of dirt.If you disagree listen the the track over and over again, see how shrill and whiney Callas's top C really is.All over brilliant performance by Gedda, Callas was unworthy of such a great Pinkerton."
5,very tight fit,"These are great outlet covers for low-use outlets. They are very tight, so if you have some outlets that you plug into/unplug often, you should probably consider a sliding or flip-type cover. You definitely have to shove some semi-rigid plastic pry bar behind them to work them loose; fingers (even the adult kind) won't do the trick."
3,"adult-proof, too!","I bought the Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs (36 Pack) for use during children's very occasional visits. These opaque plugs completely block outlets. There's no way a young child can remove them; then again. neither can adults who want to have the outlets available again. You need to pry out the plug partway with a screwdriver, crowbar, or some other tool--fingernails aren't strong enough, and because the ""head"" (not the prongs) is pliable, you can't accomplish much even with a tool--then use the fingers of both hands to pull the plug straight out. These plugs serve their purpose, especially if you don't plan on using the outlets ever again. I wish I could find the outlet plugs I used when my own children were younger: they were hard, clear plastic plugs that worked well and blended in but were easy to remove without tools when necessary (e.g., when I needed to plug in a vacuum). I would not recommend purchasing the Mommy's Helper outlet plugs."
5,They work!,Not much to say about these. They fit very firmly into an outlet and they prevent most kids from getting them out. I find myself even using something like a knife to pry them out as it can be too difficult on some outlets.
2,My 8 month old baby pulls out these outlet plugs so easily!,"I bought these outlet plugs based on the reviews. We live in a 21 year old home, and maybe our outlets are just not as tight as newer homes? I don't know the reason, but these outlet plugs are too easy for my 8 month old to pull out. He actually loves pulling them out! But, this product does give me enough time to get to him before he jams his fingers in the outlet."
3,surprised that baby can pull them out so easily,"We tried other outlet plugs that my 10 month old daughter pulled out easily, so I bought these after reading so many reviews that they are hard to remove. Unfortunately, my daughter can also pull these out very easily. My home's outlets look pretty standard to me, but perhaps there is a design issue that makes it so easy for my daughter? I'm not too upset since these were very inexpensive, but we will be looking for a different product for our outlets."
5,Love Them!,"I really like these covers! They are a clear frosted color so they look nice. Most important though, they are a tight fit so my daughter can not pull them out!"
2,There are better options,"For most situations, these should work fine. However, my 9 month old baby was able to pick at it and remove it in about 15 seconds. Not saying that all babies will do this, but it really should grip the outlet better to prevent certain babies from being able to defeat them."
3,Callas is NOT Lucia!!! That would be Sills!!!,"Callas is a great artist. However, she has a sub-par coloratura technique. Her trill is weak and she often eschews coloratura passages that she cannot sing, as evidenced by her recording of ""I Puritani"". She is overrated as Lucia. She just sounds sad and confused. Sills is so much BETTER as Lucia. Sills is totally hysterical at the beginning of the opera and only grows loonier as the show goes on. Sills is also a much better technician than Callas. You won't get shortchanged when you hear Sills' trills. Skip all of Callas' recordings of ""Luica"" and get a copy of Sills' recording. You won't be disappointed."
4,Pearl Buck delivers as usual,"I have always enjoyed reading Pearl Buck and hunt for books I haven't read yet. This book gives some of her usual perspective on China, but adds Burma to the story which is an area I have read very little about. I would recommend it."
3,Readable but Far-Fetched Potboiler,"I tried this based on my enjoyment of a short story by Mr. Brett in an omnibus of mystery stories. The writing style is quite breezy and readable, a good summer book. But the characters, with only a couple of exceptions, are not particularly likeable and the plot is very unlikely. This is not in the league of a Morse mystery - it's more of a British Columbo, only without giving away the mystery in the frist act.A fun read, but not a great read."
2,Just okay,"Mine came with a small tear on the bottom. Does not seem to be made very well. O well, you get what you pay for."
4,A Condensed Introduction to the Hebrew and Christian Canon,"Julio C. Trebolle Barberra's translation work at hand is currently a condensed material of various disciplines in the study of the Hebrew and Christian bible. Ranging from textual and linguistic discussions, finally setting the last chapter to the study of hermeneutics, the book draws the rich and vast biblical disciplines that is often underestimated by an uninitiated readers.Despite the dated work itself, the book in review provides sufficient foundational studies for any readers whose interest to pursue Biblical studies, references and materials related to both the Hebrew and the Christian scriptures and interpretation. I recommend any readers, despite a Muslim myself, to learn the knowledge based on a pure academic scholarship, not simply on speculative or polemic discourse, a trap hole often fell to not just co-religion or non-religionists, but in fact for any academic disciplines."
2,Dracula in the Deep South,"""Son of Dracula"" (1943) has everything going for it, except the presence of Bela Lugosi. Instead, Universal Studios rejected the horror icon in favor of Lon Chaney Jr. - a major blunder that seriously damages a potentially fine film. Except for the Wolf Man, Chaney's limited talents were evident in his ineffectual portrayals of the Mummy and Frankenstein's monster. As Count Alucard/Dracula, Chaney lacks the charismatic evil and strong presence that Lugosi brought to the role. Director Robert Siodmak has created a moody, atmospheric chiller set in the Deep South, yet his admirable efforts are all but ruined by Chaney's miscasting. It's a shame, because ""Son of Dracula"" was intended to be a cut above most of Universal's horror programmers. Nevertheless, the film is worth a look for its effective supporting cast and production design."
2,Meh,"The plot (vampire comes to American South), while unusual, does not make up for the mediocrity of the rest of the film. Lon Chaney phones in his performance in a bland, vanilla tone and frankly didn't scare me a bit. I was more interested in Dr. Brewster (Frank Craven) as a character, because at least he seemed to care about what was going on. Robert Paige's ""am I crazy?"" histrionics (as Kay's jilted fiancee, Frank) also brought some interest to what was otherwise a ho-hum kind of movie."
2,not a happy camper,We just took this cooler on a three day camping trip on Memorial da weekend. I packed the cooler with ice from our fridge and by the morning we needed to get more ice. So we filled it with two bags of ice from the store and by that evening we needed to add another two bags of ice to it. The top of the cooler is kind of flat so you can't have anything sticking over the top of the cooler or when you go to close it the lid will pop off. This cooler is good for a backyard bbq to keep drinks cold but that's about it. It's not a good cooler to keep things cold for a couple days.
1,The duplicate 5 star reviews are from the author's business partner,"Please be aware that Jeff Schlageter is a business partner of the book's author, Orion Kopelman, in a business called Global Brains. His review (3 duplicates!) cannot be considered objective."
1,A thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters...,"...could labor for a thousand years and never produce such a trivial, ill-informed recipe for running your organization into the ground."
1,Maximum Style offers minimum rewards for readers,"This book is next to useless. The writing is full of adolescent puns, and relies mainly on one or two style advisors for quotes on how to dress. There are plenty of other better books on the subject out there. Don't buy this one."
5,"Matt knows his stuff - REALy,","Having taken handgun and tactical rifle training from others, I can tell you that Matt's REAL system is the real deal - no pun intended. Matt's techniques are field researched, easy to learn, and automatic (which means when it comes time to use them, you'll remember what you learned).I highly recommend anything coming from Canovi and Associates. The people there really to care about your personal safety so you can ""stay safe out there."" They also want you to have the best training and equipment for the lowest possible cost. You won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"You would think they would have something to draw attention of the toddlers, but it is crazy. Don't know how anyone could watch it!!!!"
2,UFO,"this movie is kind a UFO... never seen in France (or very briefly), though Chevalier was French... the quality of the dvd is poor, but it's watchable. in fact, the movie suffers from a very bad cutting, directing.... suffers from everything: a good story spoiled. But Jayne is not overacting, which is an opportunity to see her ""au naturel"", not too bad an actresse at all! a few moments on the beach, in bikini, romancing with co star: she looks stunning! a pity the studios dropped her for so bad films."
4,Angela Hewitt her inspiration and soul,She gives us thru this particular masterpice a good idea how the clasic music has to be play.
1,The seller didn't refund my money,"I returned the CD because it didn't play. The seller ImportCDs gave me instructions for returning the CD, which I followed. When I questioned them as to why they didn't return my money, they demanded a confirmation number which I didn't have because they didn't tell me I needed to return the CD registered mail. They never refunded my money."
5,A Fine Soundtrack of a Fine Movie,"I basically love the movie, because it's poetic along with Montana wilderness and I am a fly-fisherman. I have just bought this CD as my background music while I am tying flies. And it works very very well. Each track reminds me of each moment of the movie, especially, tracks from Track 25 ""Yes, Quite a Day"" to Track 31 ""Hauted by Waters"" just make me poignant. An exclusive interview with the composer is also very unique and worth to hear about the background of the movie. ""The Moment That Could Not Last"" last only 1:24, how about in our real life? Is it gonna be like Paul's? I am hautend by this soundtrack."
2,Street Corner Robbery,"It's an O.K. action story about gangs in L.A. and a priest who tries to help. There are some familiar character actors who make the movie worth seeing when you have nothing better to do. This movie was produced for distribution in theaters overseas but only for the rental market in the U.S. In 1995, I appeared as an extra in this movie, but I've never seen the final production because the price is a joke, and I've never been able to find it in any video store..."
4,"Sparky, WA, USA","Easy to use and gives good results. Nice long cord to connect the Xitel to your amp. Software is easy to set up and the directions are clear. The sound quality with my Ipod and Bose speaker is very good. Since small and compact, easy to put away when not using. The price was right making it cost effective to convery my vinyl versus buying CD's or buying on-line. Good product and highly recommend."
5,Impressive product!,"I have wanted for years to convert my old LPs and reel-to-reel tapes to digital format, but always thought the process sounded too cumbersome. The Xitel INport Deluxe is as easy as it claims to be. Just run the included cables from the receiver line out jacks to the computer USB port and start the source. There are some initial settings (regarding sound level and distortion, etc.) to make, but the enclosed short manual walks you through those in 5-7 minutes. I am extremely pleased with this product, and am glad to have my music easily available again."
5,Advice for Vista users,"If you have Vista, you'll need to request the latest version of LP Recorder and LP Ripper from the manufacturer (look in the help files for the address for technical support). You don't want the trial versions on the website - those versions won't accept your licence key. Fortunately, CFB was very prompt with their response (I e-mailed Sunday night and had a link to the files by Monday morning).Once I had the right versions, everything worked without a hitch. I used the setup to digitise music I'd taped from radio ten years ago, and while there isn't much any program can do to improve the quality, the file I recorded was as good as the original.In addition, LP Ripper is a rather handy piece of software - if you used CoolEdit back when it was free and not owned by Adobe to split sound files, you'll find a lot of uses for this program."
1,something wrong,"I hooked it up like the directions said and even tried a few other tricks. Nothing got it to work. Not sure if it was defective or not, just returned it. On the brighter side it was solidly built and had an excellent cable with it. Unknown why I couldn't get it to work"
1,No Customer Service,"I have Windows XP. 3 people in my family tried to get this to work. All are computer smart. No luck. Xitel does not have customer support. You either get it to work or you return it. When you return it, you will get way less than what you bought it for."
4,Able to move tapes and vinyl to CDs,Although the instructions were initially long and somewhat convoluted I was able to move music and voices from both cassette tapes and vinyl to my computer and subsequently to CDs. There is still an issue of converting the WAV files to MP3.
3,Actually Old Convention Card,"This book was written in 1994 to help players fill out the new convention card but the ACBL came out with a even newer card around 1999. If you have a current convention card and this book it won't work since they don't match. Plus there is very little meat in thos book. Bergen has so many better books available like Better Bidding With Bergen and Points Schmoints. Both are 5 star books. If you bought Better Bidding With Bergen volumes I and II, Points Schmoints, More Points Schmoints, and The Law of Total Tricks by Larry Cohen a partner of Bergen's you'd have a great duplicate bridge library."
4,Technoclub v.6 - definitely worth the buy,"This a great trance mix. Taucher and Talla are two of my favorite dj's, and them together on the same album is a god send. Buy it now!"
4,Your new favorite band - Electro Meets Rock Meets Power Punk,"CLOR comes out of nowhere to produce one of the freshest, challenging, and just plain FUN albums of the year. Melding NYC no-wave rock with New Wave pop songcraft with Electro sonics with crunchy power-punk punch and signature UK nasal vocals, CLOR delivers a potent brew, recalling a wide range of past influences and references while managing to sound like no one else today. Key cuts LOVE & PAIN, MAGIC TOUCH, OUTLINES, and more tell the story. Try it, you'll like it. *Also hunt down the KRAFTWERK meets HERBERT remix by JOAKIM of MAGIC TOUCH on import CD single - absolute dancefloor mayhem!"
2,Nothing but typos,"The publisher should be ashamed of the shoddy proofreading. I've found fifty two typos in the first four chapters alone! Which is a pity, because I love the character Richard Sharpe, and every typo pulls me right out of the story. As far as I'm concerned we should all get our money back!"
5,Excellent addition to the series,"I began reading the Sharpe series after seeing the programs onPBS, and I am very hapy that I did. The writing is crisp, and thebooks are consistently entertaining. I see the author is now going into Richard Sharpe's past (before the Peninsula Campaign), and I am pleased that there will be more of these works coming in the future."
2,What am I missing?,"Wow -- everyone loves this but me! I don't get it -- I read Cornwell's Agincourt right before this book, and they're almost identical books. Pretty much the same characters in the same situtation -- just 300 years apart. The same lead character, the same female companion, the same strong leader, the same completely evil villian.....it really lacks creativity for me. The good are completely good, and the evil are completely evil -- I've seen more balanced characters in a Steven King novel. On top of that, the coincidences in this book are outrageous. How many times can the hero and the villian happen to accidently run into each other all over India?I enjoy learning about the British army and their battles in India, but the writing seems very lazy and schlocky to me."
5,Erik the Viking,"I can't believe this is finally out on dvd version 1!!! yeah! I have been waiting so long for this. What a fantastically silly movie with a great cast. Please get this if you are a Monty Python fan, well worth it!I like the song that goes tum tum tum ti tum tum.yeah! I say to you a second time."
2,HackJob,"I have to wonder if those that love this flick ""as is"" (director's sons' cut) have ever watched the original theatrical release???? I love Tim Robbins and the Monty Python group, and this flick was great in it's original 101 minute movie release. In this Director's Sons' Cut, it's now 79 minutes and most of the best one liners and running gags are gone. If you've never seen the original then you probably wouldn't mind all the cutting because it's still funny but if you've seen the full length version recently, you would know why so many are complaining. I think Terry Jones is genius but letting his son cut it for a U.S. audience was a mistake. What a hack job!"
1,Absolutely Horrendous Version,"I agree 100% with another reviewer's comments...If you love this film, do not buy this DVD. This version is terrible. I watched it one time and wanted to take the disc outside, lay it on my driveway, and run over it with my car - repeatedly. Go back to editing school, Bill Jones. Truly insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie. I'd give it negative stars if I could."
2,Not What I Expected,"A great adventure in the Monty Python style. Always difficult to find on DVD, it was a pleasant surprise to see it re-released. Unfortunately, this version is designed for television, and a full twenty-five minutes shorter than my original VHS version. In spots, the editing done to shorten the film is amateurish, and the tacked on generic water sounds used to fatten up the original audio for surround sound is more a distraction than an augmentation to the movie. I will be keeping my VHS tape while awaiting a true DVD release."
4,Great Movie,"My brother and I really love this film but when he asked for it for Christmas one year, it was not yet available on dvd in the USA so I purchased this version. He had to watch it on his computer but I think he was happy to have it. Now it's out in the US and he has another copy but this is great to have for collectors."
3,A succint presentation of a new view of the Gospels.,"Jesus' purpose in his Sermons and Parables seems far clearer now as relating to the instructions Paul gave. Seeming conflict appears resolved in the perspective Weaver presents. Even if a reader does not agree with the thesis, the study and meditation this book provokes will be very productive, I believe, and should affect one's thinking on the subject to one's benefit. I hope to see some reviews of the book by some creditable theologians soon. I expect that they will bring up aspects of the relationship between the Epistles and the Gospels that eluded me."
4,Excellent Primer - Basics but lacks detail,"This is an excellent basics book and would rate it 5 stars if that is what you are looking for. I give it 4 stars because it gives one enough information to be dangerous but not enough to certain . Example: Using fungicides and pesticides. Certain trees Maples for instance, are very sensitive and be harmed using chemicals they recommend are safe for most trees. Define most!! An excellent starter basics book just not the only book one should use in my view."
2,Bonsai Plants,This book was boring but it's not something i am interested in. i think if someone who was interested in bonsai read it they would find it really good and it would probably help them with their bonsai if they kept them. But as i only used the book for a project in english i didnt enjoy it. maybe if i was interested in them i'd like it. i'm not saying it was rubbish but then it wasnt the most exciting book to read
3,Sparse,No real indepth information. It does have a lot of different trees listed but don't rely on this to be your only book on the subject.
3,Sophisticated backdrops,"There is some interesting guitar texture work to be found on the progressive-light album, although a majority of tracks here are better enjoyed as sophisticated background music rather then in depth research."
2,Four Seasons,My son is 10 months and has been listening/watching Baby Genius since he was 2 months. He loves Mozart and Friends and Sleepytime so we were shocked when he cried when we put in Four Seasons. He will have nothing to do with it; maybe Vivaldi is a little intense for him right now.
3,Dubstar - Stars,"STARS rightly made Dubstar famous, and here, on its original release, the Rapino Brothers offer up two spacey dance mixes that are passable on the floor. Mother gives birth to a completely dubby, tripped out version, slowing the track down to a lazy, head-nodding pace. Steve Hillier puts his own dance moves on the track, adding some synth patches that seem more shrill than they need to be. Good, but the track would get better mixes in a later release."
1,The Complete Guide to Full Body Chair Massage,"I sent it back. I did not find this DVD set worth the money I paid for it and when returned only got 1/2 of my money back because it was opened. I understand the company's thinking, but how else would you find out if the video is a stinker or not???? Way to much talking about info I did not need. Might be good if you had never done, see or heard of massage ever in your life. Not for the experienced CMT."
4,Love it!,"Love this video. I love the way Meade Steadman demonstrates massage techniques. He actually does a full body massage in the chair & uses his knees, too."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought these shears for light duty hedge cutting when I didn't want to get out my gas powered hedge cutters. They are junk. They rusted easily, although I never left them out in the rain or exposed to the elements. The blade seemed dull from the first time I used them. The rust has also increased the amount of effort required to operate the shears. Also, the handles are too close together so every time you go to cut something you land up smashing your knuckles together in as the handles close. Not a pleasant experience. Based on this experience I would not buy another Fiskar's product."
3,Harder than you would think it would be,"I bought this for my 5 year old son to play. It is too hard for him to even complete 1 race on the easy setting. The cars crash so easily. My husband, who plays games all of the time, even said it was difficult to maneuver the cars to stay on the track. My son ened up getting frustrated after 10 minutes and hasn't played it since. I wish some of these games would come equipped with a handicap or something that you can set to allow a child to play without crashing constantly. The graphics are extra cool in this game though."
3,Callas in bad form,"This has got to be one of the worst records with Maria Callas. There is an intrusive wobble in the whole register which makes listening a pain. Gedda who made 3 studio recordings with her later recalled that at this stage she sang as if she had a potato in her mouth. He was right and I cannot think of any other singer who would have been allowed recording in such bad voice. But Callas will always sell...Pretre's conducting is sluggish - not at all a match for Beecham, Cluytens, Karajan or Abbado. He is simply not able to hold the ensemble together with the required firm hand.Are there any redeeming features? Yes, indeed, Gedda himself is stylish as always and Guiot is a vulnerable and very moving Micaela. This just doesn't make a Carmen. Gedda is even heard to greater advantage with Beecham and that in a very atmospheric recording."
5,What a great convenience,"I don't know how impenetrable this device is, but it sure makes life easier. I've got a bunch of different passwords & user names, so not having to remember all of them or type them in is fantastic."
4,Works great,The scanner works well with both Windows XP and later 7. Have to redownload Windows 7 driver from their site.
1,The thing is just useless for Apple Users and the AD with the package should be changed,"The statement on the package and on their website says: ""free yourself from passwords"" and everyone reads also the ""it works with MAC"", so what to expect?OK it doesn't work with passwords.Only with the login.This is enough.Apple users beware.I am also wondering why no one even at Macworld - see their ad about this - didn't care to say a word.Now back at asking my money back."
5,Simply the best self-help book I've ever read so far,"I also recommend Tolle's The Power of Now, which also helped me a lot, but I guess Tolle's book is well-known.I followed what this book says, and within days, it started to work. Just as the book said it would. Brilliant. I was so impressed with the result that I purchased everything this author has to offer."
5,Wonderful Book!,"The poetry in this book is sensitive, thoughtful and heartwarming .... a good read!!"
2,Weak writing about Matthew 18:15-17 (Biblical Church Discipline),"I read John MacArthur's book The Freedom and Power of Forgivness and R.T. Kendall's book Total Forgiveness a week apart from each other. I found the MacArthur book a stronger book, its biblical insights, and the important coverage given to Matthew 18:15-17, Biblical Church Discipline.Mr. Kendall's book, while sincere and hopeful, doesn't properly articulate Matthew 18:15-17 for dealing with peoples' strongholds of sin. Either Mr. Kendall wasn't taught it, doesn't know how to carry it out, or doesn't know how to carry it out effectively and Biblically. Some of his suggestions about why we shouldn't confront people are contrary to Jesus' express commands that we are required to confront people in their sins (Matt:18:15-17). I found Jay Adams book Handbook of Church Discipline helpful in explaining Matthew 18:15-17, along with John MacArthur's book on Forgiveness, and Ken Sande's book The Peacemaker."
2,some truth but mostly opinion,"This book has truth in it, but it's hard to find it b/c the author so overstates his opinion without scriptural support and then in the next chapter he will just as strongly contradict his earlier opinion. The focus is always on what the individual needs to do, with little mention of God's part in changing our hearts and helping us to forgive others. God has used this book in my life, but it has been inspite of the author not because of him."
1,Useless - DO NOT BUY,"I bought because I have a toddler and because this was only $3.00. This cord windup did not work. I put cord inside and put the cover on. When I tried to spin it to wind up the cord, it kept on getting stuck. To add insult to injury, the ridges on the cover kept on scratching my hand up. I haven't bothered returning yet because it was only 3.00"
4,Great for the cost,"Considering the price, these are great. I had no trouble with the 4 I bought. Only one clicked open while attaching it and it was easy to snap back together without having to redo it. Once attached they won't move, so these aren't going to be convenient for a window shade that is adjusted constantly, but they are exactly what we needed. I plan on buying more."
3,"Does it's job, not easy to install","I don't like the fact that if you try and pull on the cord to raise or lower your shades, it just pops off and you have to re-attach it and wind it up every time. It does it's job but like any baby proofing item it's annoying and not easy to install."
1,Junk: a total waste of money.,"Wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing 5 packs of these. Flimsy, cheap plastic with razor sharp edges. They serve to store the cords but there's no way to wind them. Misleading, indeed. I'm going to return these."
4,Great books,This is not our fave Priddy book but the images in most of the series are clear and tons of fun to poke through with my daughter who recieved a few of these for her first b-day. I highly recommend these books.
4,Good Little Book,This book is great for pre-school and younger children. I would recommend it for learning first words.
2,Not what I expected.,"I expected the old testament, not a discussion of the old testament. Be more clear what this is and is not."
4,Good information,Have not had time to read much of this but what I have read is great. Hope the rest is as good as what I have read.
4,yes and no,"This book has a lot to recommend it, and the reviewers enthusing below are not altogether off the mark. It is well-written,the story is interesting, the characters are lively (particularly the alien admiral), the battle scenes are vivid, and the ending is clever. However, characters change rank from chapter to chapter, the math is frequently wrong, and the Star Trek continuity errors are glaring enough for a reader with a fairly low-intensity interest in the series (e.g. me) to notice them. It is an enjoyable book, with more cerebral and philosophical awareness than most mass-market novels, but it's not quite a masterpiece. END"
3,Better than the Movie,While the movie had a clever premise I was bored by the MTV look. But this book is witty and introduces the characters that have now become legendary. I am glad I read this. The author does an excellent job of setting the atmosphere and presenting the action. If I had read this instead of seeing the movie I might have started watching the first year.
5,Don't miss this one,"This 1954 performance of Norma captures Maria Callas when her voice was in its prime. Callas makes this exceedingly difficult role seem easy. Several major divas (Joan Sutherland among them) have distinguished themselves with Norma, but so far no one matches Callas."
1,Down For The Count,"I didn't like this book. The art is ugly, the story is stupid, and after I read it once, I donated it to our local thrift store, so they could throw it away."
2,Makes you scared,"This book just basically tells you whats coming up in your future as a teen. That you gonna be confronted with drugs, sex, and other things, but it makes you sort of scared to be a teenager. Like it says you shouldn't hold hands because it leads to sex. Taking everything just out of proportion. Makes it sound like your going to burn in hell for doing the littlest things. I wouldn't recommend giving this to your child, or they might fear growing up."
4,"explains ""how chemistry developed as a discipline.""","The usual approach to explaining Chemistry as a discipline or branch of learning is to launch into the current ""state of knowledge"" presentation; i.e. the known physical laws, the mathematical reltionships, etc. Some of us think more along historical lines and the development of patterns. This book, by concenctrating on the historical development of the thought allows those of us who think this way to ""ooze into"" the subject, gain some understanding of the problems that were solved, understanding of the experiments that solved them and thus gives us a better understanding of the problems to be solved today."
5,"Wonderful Opera, Great Performances","I believe this is Puccinis' greatest opera. Every act is filled with beautiful melodies and arias. Even the recitatives are very melodious. Now add to the above a once in a lifetime performance, that makes you feel as if you are watching the opera play out before your eyes, in all its dramatic, romantic intensity, and you have a five star must have cd."
2,2nd best HP album? WTF!,"If you are a casual fan, ignore these reviews: buy Smokin', Fillmore and Biscuit.I read these reviews and I want to hurl. 2nd best HP release? Let's see: what's first? In my list, it's the 3 above. Then Safe and Rock On, that's 5. Eat it has Say No More. I like cuts on Town and HP. How can this be number 2 on anyone's list? I love Marriott but get a grip! When the band toured in 73-75 how many cuts from this did they play? One: Thunderbox. And can any really who hasn't taken too much dope listen to Rally with Ali?Here's a voting of HP releases from a poll of fans in 2009:1. Rocking the Fillmore 1032. King Biscuit Flower Hour 1003. Eat It 964. Smokin 955. Rock On 826. As Safe as yesterday 767. Town & Country 728. Humble Pie 649. Scrubbers 509. Thunderbox 5011. Street Rats 2812. Running With the Pack 22As Stan Lee always ended: 'Nuff said!"
4,Unknown No Longer,"In Response to H...I have not heard of this album until today, but I wanted to let you know that you ""should"" or DO already know who Mario Vasquez is. He has been in the news lately, creating a lot of buzz, as the American Idol contestant who suddenly left... A news release revealed today that he was featured in this album and may be the reason for him unfortunately having to leave the show, though no one wants to reveal what the reason really is."
5,Great 80s metal,This is a great CD with awesome songs and guitar solos. This CD has so much Hair Metal and 80s metal feel to it and I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of those genres. Overall this is an awesome CD and I love it!
1,item misrepreesnted as NEW...it had been used,"I paid for an unused puzzle book. If the book had been carefully perused prior to shipment, it would have been OBVIOUS that the very first puzzle in the book had been partially filled in. It will make me reluctant to order in the future."
2,Haphazard Walkthrough of the Movie,"This was an interesting game, maybe the first couple of times. It is about trying to play out the movie as close as possible. You learn the ""walk-through"" a little better each time you play. After a couple of times, it is pretty boring.Unless you are an all-out LOTR nut, pass this one up unless you just don't mind spending the buck knowing you will only play it a couple times and may not like it at all anyway.Like I said, it's a walk-through of the movie and unless you own all three, you move charactors to a space and all of a sudden you just remove them from the game.I cannot see this being a ""hit"" for anyone. It will either be a complete ""miss"" or a ""miss"" that keeps your attention for a short period of time."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I grew up in the WCG, and like most former members, have quite a few scars and just as many questions.This book has helped so much with understand not just the error of our old ways but why we believed them, what Herbert Armstrong's vision originally was, and the complete timeline of the doctrinal changes and split of the church after he passed.It's written by someone who was right in the midst of the caos and who has a complete understanding of the hurt and confusion that was caused. Let's be honest, only those who were a part of the WCG can fully understand what kind of damage and confusion was left behind.I've already recommended this book to other previous members of the WCG in hopes it can bring as much clarity and comfort as it has brought me."
4,Gave me new hope,"I found this book quite enlightening and informative. It's filled with up-to-date information this is presented in a well-organized manner. As someone who suffers from bipolar disorder, I found it uplifting to learn more about what's wrong with me and see that progress is being made toward better treatments. This book should be read by bipolar patients, as well as their families and friends. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,Book reviewer correction,"A very helpful source for information on this book and depressive disorders was noted by a reader from Bethesda. However the organization name is ""DRADA"" not ""DRAGA"". Depression and related affective disorders association."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I am a GED/ESL teacher and I was hoping to find that perfect supplement to the regular Steck-Vaughn GED Mathematics book. The GED Mathematics book is intense and often needs elaboration so I find myself looking at various websites for math drills to really solidify the topic. I was hoping I could avoid wasting my time by buying this book and boy, was I wrong. It doesn't provide much drill for skill and just skims over the most important topics.Go to www.math-drills.com to find quality FREE material! This book is junk."
1,Deception,"There is no warm-up in this DVD. The first session Burn and Firm presents uninteresting exercises to a rhythm very struck without progress in the effort. The second session Cardio Blast proposes a combination of movements about a fast rhythm with or without weight. The movements with weight are difficult to master. Be careful in wounds. The instructors are talkative without being of quite rewarding. They have no interaction with the other persons. The music is reduced to a very boring beatbox. Grey clothings, grey environment, depressing atmosphere."
1,this movie was awful and reeked of a horrible plot,"ok, i love freddie and jamie, but this movie blew. the plot was terrible, the acting was second rate. and, the filming was weird. the accents were fake. it was COMPLETELY unrealistic. for those of you who hate wasting your time, you'll hate this movie. but, for those of you who like movies simply because of their stars, you'll like it."
4,So Quick With New Bisquick,"This cook book came to me very quickly. It is in better condition than described, which was an unusual and happy result. I would recommend River City Books with confidence."
5,An excellent documentary : Easton is superb,"In general, I much prefer the Ken Burns approach to documentaries : vintage portraits or pictures with voice-overs. This is one of the best biographical PBS films I know of that features live actors. Easton is very believable as Benjamin Franklin : the quotes are very well chosen and I thoroughly enjoyed watching Easton act them out."
2,Great game!!,"This is a great game.The only way I play it is on an old demo disc.me,my brother,and my freind think this is a great game.I suggest this game to anyone who likes to crush heads and have other players flattened."
5,Best game I have played in a while,"The graphics are great and so is the fighting. If you buy this game I think, no garuntee that you will love it. Everyone I know who has this game loves it and wouldn't trade it for anything. Buy this game and have a great time!!!"
4,Tear down a city after a hard day at work...,"Up front I will admit that I am not a gamer - at least not like my friends are. I only own half a dozen games and I pick them based on their uniqueness, and being single they tend to be games that don't require others to enjoy. That said I love War of the Monsters for allowing me to the ability to mindlessly destroy and entire city (raze it to the ground) and blow off steam in a socially acceptable way. The graphics are of a high enough quality that I don't spend my time nit picking the look of it and allow myself to become immersed in the mayhem. Now that I am thinking of it I will probably pop it in for a while tonight before I go to bed. The down side for me is that I have unlocked everything and really have nothing else to look forward to, unless of course I start again from scratch..."
5,Nigel Kennedy: There Really IS a Musician Beneath the Hype,"Even if he had not written a great deal of other brilliant music, Elgar's concerti for violin and violoncello assure him a place among music's immortals. Nigel Kennedy does a great job here; he and Simon Rattle work so well together here, it is a shame that Kennedy's famous temperament doesn't permit him to work with Rattle more (but maybe Rattle is temperamental too, who knows?)The one time I heard Kennedy live, my shoulder was tapped to turn pages for his accompanist in the Elgar violin sonata. Before that afternoon, I hadn't realized Elgar ever wrote a violin sonata. The brilliance of that piece, and the brilliance of Nigel's performance that day (he also played his heart out in the Bartók solo sonata) are captured unfailingly in all this disc, for all its being a different occasion and different music.Had never heard the Vaughan Williams before; marvelous, gossamer, magical."
4,Wish I'd read Noah's Garden first,"At a native gardening workshop I attended recently, the presenter said that she loved Noah's Garden, but that this book - Planting Noah's Garden - was an even better book. I hadn't read either, and so I decided to go with the one that she said was best. It's a bit hard to fully understand the context without having read the first book. However, I like Sara's practical approach to gardening, and the way she questions some advice from traditional landscapers, instead looking at how plants grow in the wild, and using that as her guide."
5,How about a real review?,"The past few ""reviews"" are more bickering than helpful. Esp. the last one. Not musical and not one word on the other singers. Thank God Callas recorded Leonora when her voice was still in luscious, fine shape. There are no wobbles and Callas sounds serene, esp. in Vergine degli angeli and the finale. Her Pace, Pace is haunting, lovely and beautiful. This is an angelic, yet human Leonora, suffering, loving and incredibly beautiful. Tucker is in top form except for some over the top sobs and sighs. His duet with Tagliabue is an AMAZING example of dramatic singing. Listen to the phrase ""Deh! Non lasciarmi! Leonora!"" (In the finale) where he sings with Caruso-like drama! Brilliant! Tagliabue's career was near the end when this recording was made but he still sounds great, esp. in his big aria. This isn't the best Forza, there are MANY good ones. Forza is an opera where I couldn't name the ""best"" recording. But this one is VERY good!"
5,A user friendly guide to teaching values to young children,"The book consists of ten chapters, one devoted to each value: cooperation, courage, friendship, honesty, kindness, loyalty, respect, self-control, sharing, and tolerance. Each chapter includes an introduction to the values, a list of suggestions for families to help them reinforce the value at home, a ""script"" to explain the value to children, a fingerplay, a story with thought-provoking questions, three activities or games, community connections, and a reading list. The approach is based on parents, teachers, and communities working together to help children become value-able people!I am the author and would love to hear your feedback."
4,Helpful and easy to read,"It is a very nice book for foreigners. I speak portuguese and found a lot of good material in the book. It helped me a lot on writing papers, reports and other related material for computer science."
2,Doesn't work well with XP,"Initially it works well with XP until about the 3rd consecutive scan. After that is jams the scan cue and eventually will hang.My advice is to save your money if you have XP. Get a Hewlett Packard printer, which has a decent driver and an excellent user interface to merge files together into a single document. Then drag the files it into Adobe Acrobat. I have a lexmark X125, which has a very poorly designed user interface with very few options for scanning."
1,It doesn't work,"First of all, let me make it clear that I am a HUGE fan of Timi Yuro, and have been waiting 19 years (since I bought my first cd player) for her albums to appear on CD. She didn't come close to getting the credit she deserved as an artist. I was really looking forward to this CD, it even included one of my favorite songs, CRAZY, and was an album I was not familiar with. I regret to say that this album does not even come close to working. The combination of her voice, interpretation, orchestration, arrangements, and mostly songs that are not very good, simply don't work together.Now that she has passed away, I hear that RPM Records is finally going to issue her albums on CD. It appears my 19 year wait may be over."
2,Disturbing and Difficult Read...,"I was a dedicated fan of Celine Dion before I read this book. Although I will always remain a fan of her music, I no longer respect Celine and her husband Rene. Celine portrays herself as a lovesick, immature and all around helpless woman who cannot survive one minute without her ailing, 26 year older husband. This book really is a homage to her husband more than a book about her career. I am aghast that Celine's family practically sold her out to Rene when she was barely a teenager and did nothing to stop his seduction of her. Don't waste your time and money on this book."
1,Perhaps she should stick to singing...,"I really like Celine Dion as a singer, but reading this autobiography was a bit much. It was somewhat disturbing to read of her ""courtship"" of Rene Angelil. She seduced him--a married man over 20 years older than herself--and does not even mention the repercussions this had on his shaky marriage (it led to divorce, of course). Her fantasies of seducing and being with him when she was only 14 years old were disturbing, as is her almost total dependence on him. I really didn't need to know all of those details--it's almost like reading a tabloid magazine.I think she should stick to what she does best, and leave the book writing to someone else!"
2,BUZZ LIGHTYEAR WATCH,"This is a cute watch, and the shooting frisbee feature is good for a few minutes of fun. The watch never told the right time and the shooter bent and broke after a few uses. For the money, it wasnt a horrible purchase, but of course it was a disappointment to the kids when we kept having to re-set the time. Our 4 year old is just getting interested in telling time and kept proudly announcing ""It's 4:30!"" just to have us constantly telling him that his watch was incorrect and needed to be re-set! Having said that, it was cheaper than going to a movie and the fun lasted just slightly longer."
1,The Almost Perfect MP3 Player,Why Almost Perfect MP3 Player? Because it doesn't plays wma songs.i looked at every flash memory mp3 player on amazon.com. the iaudio had the best reviews.i went to the jet audio website and saw that they had a 256 mb player. this is not readily apparent on amazon.com. i went back to amazon.com; looked again and found the 256....converting cds to mp3 format is so simple.downloading to the iaudio using the jet shell software is a breeze. i audio has already set it up so you can compartmentalize your music into 4 folders and one for voice recordings.cannot emphasize enough how small it is. easy to hold and control the functions with one hand.i have never been compelled to rate an item before but i want people to know what a great product this is.
2,not worthy the money and unsatisfied customer service,"Assuming I received a correct item, it is actually a pair of 22'' long gloves with no maker label and mainly made of nylon. Wearable but cheap looking. No responses after calls and emails to the seller."
3,"worked for my purpose, definitely costume gloves","These gloves are good quality for costume gloves, but not for a very dressy occation. Reasonably prices for what you get."
1,XBR KDL-32XBR4 broke,"I bought this TV(Sony Bravia XBR KDL-32XBR4 32"" LCD HDTV ) less than 2 years ago, it is broken like the other people, veritical color strips. It was working well even yesterday. After found some many people has the same issue as me, I called the Sony support and then they transfer me to the 'customer relationship support', the first guy was very rude and asked me to spend several hundred dollars to get it evaluate and said that is not a known issue. Definitely I will not buy a Sony anyway. At least my friend's Vuzio bought at the same time but only half price is still working.Sony Bravia XBR KDL-32XBR4 32"" LCD HDTV"
1,Very disappointed,"I owned this TV for a little more than 3 years, before the LCD panel burned out, rendering it useless (since the repair would have cost a lot more than a new TV.) On average, LCD TVs are supposed to last about 100,000 hours. I watched mine maybe 2 hours a day on average, so I'd estimate that the TV lasted about 2200 hours. Not what I expected from Sony. The faulty LCD panel is a known issue: there was even a recall on the 46 inch model. I called Sony, but they wouldn't do anything for me except offer me another TV - a 40 inch, which I didn't want - at a bit of a discount. I bought a new Samsung instead.Sony used to make quality products. No more, it seems, judging by the number of one-star reviews I see for their TVs.Yes, the picture was great while it lasted. But it didn't last long."
1,"Don't Buy, Vertical Lines Show Up After 18 Months of Use","Started out to be a great set (nice color, great viewing angle, decent picture). Then after 18 months it developed vertical stripes and is now unwatchable. Sony warranty expired and they will not recall even though there are many other similar complaints on the web and Amazon. Possibly a series of bad panels. Bad public relations for Sony. My other 32 XBR2 Sony is holding up beautifully. Probably a bad set of panels from mid to late 2007. Please call Sony and complain if you are getting similar problem."
1,Multi-colored lines,"About 30 months of use, i have finally been plagued with the multi-colored stripes. The picture quality of the TV is great, but what's the point if its only going to work for less than 3 years? Probably not buying a SONY again."
1,Couldn't finish it.,"Had great expectations for this work, but found too many stumbling blocks to make it past the halfway point. For example, the lack of quotation marks. Who's speaking? When is the writing descriptive vs. dialogue? It became too much of a struggle to keep going over paragraphs to figure it out. While the author's intent may have been a breakthrough style, the ultimate effect was affectation. There were some fine moments of characterization, but it was finally too much work to get through it all."
2,"Save your money for ""Reborn""","Let me just start off by saying that Living Sacrifice has to be one of the best Hardcore bands ever! Their music, and Christian message is just plain awesome! However, before their newest CD ""Reborn"", they weren't quite as good. While the instrumental part of this CD is just awesome, the vocals are a candidate for the worst I've ever heard. I think they fired the lead singer after this album, because they have a different one on Reborn. The lead singer on this album doesn't even sing, he just pretty much talks in an extremely deep voice. It almost sounds like he's trying to hack up a hairball or something. It's that bad! Save your money."
4,Warmth and coolness simultaneously,"Giulini manages to be coolheaded about this wrenching and massive score while allowing some northern Italian/southern Austrian warmth to infiltrate it. It is in fact less of a heart-on-sleeve performance than Barbirolli's, let alone any of Bernstein's, but the performance's architectural splendor is thoroughly convincing--overcoming slight reservations that may creep in when looking at the total timing on the first movement (31.5 minutes, or two minutes slower than the already leisurely Bernstein/Concertgebouw on the same label). In this approach he is actually aided by the Chicago Symphony, a great orchestra whose sound is normally inappropriate for Mahler. By the way, both the original LPs and the first CD release were marred by a weird, unnatural vibrato effect in some string passages, but the remastering for DG's ""The Originals"" series fixes this. Fortunately."
5,Keeps me coming back for more,I bought this book sometime after hearing Kenn Kington at a youth conference a few years back. His advice is practical and quite entertaining. I have read this amazing book several times in full and when I just need some encouragement I can always pick it up and read the chapters that I may need at any given moment. Kenn does a good job of using biblical applications whenever possible. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.
4,Works Great,"Works great and looks good, mine came in black. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because where you can plug a cord into is already loose. This is great because it has a cord coming straight out of it and a place to plug another so I use it for a backup to my dish and also to my reciever for FM radio, I get every station in my area clear as ever."
2,Average,"I hoped for the sound one but it didn't really specify when ther are or not... It is not of a very good material, when little kids try several time t insert it, it gets kind of ruined..."
1,looks like a generic,"I just installed 4 kyb shocks on my 4runner, so thought this might be ok.Unlike the shocks I installed, KYB is not stamped on this steering damper.Only the box says KYB. The instructions do not say KYB. I ran the numbers stampedon this steering damper through google, and didn't come up with anything to make me believe thisdamper is made by KYB. If it was made by KYB, they're cetainly not too proud of it.Price was ok so I'll eventually try it, not worth the hassle of sending it back. I would not have bought this if I could have seen it first."
1,cheap,My worn out stabilizer felt better. The pushrod that goes in and out the cylinder doesn't even have any boot or protection for dirt. It started to rust 1 month after installation.
5,SUPER,"Please show us listing of the songs, because we're not sure if its the same ""SAVAGE"" we think it is."
2,Disappointing storyline,"The concept of this book is excellent (a duel French-English picture book with a French pronunciation guide at the back), however as parents, we were really disappointed by the disinteresting story the book presents. Our bilingual story-loving toddler seems to agree - this is one of the only books I have seen him refuse for a bedtime story. A great idea, but sadly lacking in its delivery."
1,Be careful,"I ordered this book at this website, but received totally different one, a volume of 1972 year book, 5 cents from a public library. Until now I have not get my money back yet. I wish someone could help me and improve the service in the future!"
2,not up to par,I usually enjoy reading these authors but with this book I stopped reading with about 30 pgs left. I just didn't care anymore.
5,Great for price,"We use the microwave every day and have not had a single problem. Does not do Popcorn well but, very quick on all other foods."
3,Dumb Things Sharp Does,The unit comes with an advertising blurb glued to the front which is extermely difficult and time consuming ( 1 Hour plus and its not all off) to remove without scratching the surface. It's frustrating that a stupid thing like this mars what otherwise might be an adequate product. I will hesitate before buying another Sharp product.
2,poor power level selection,"The microwave worked well, but who designs a microwave where you have to press the power level button SEVEN times in order to get a power setting of 30%????? I just wanted to defrost a chicken breast. Since that wasn't one of the pre-programmed foods for defrosting, I tried to set the microwave to defrost for a few minutes. But who has the patience to punch that power level button all those times to reduce the power level to 30% for defrosting????"
1,"850 watts, not 1200","This microwave was purchased to replace a similar 1200 watt Sharp microwave that I had had so many years that I don't remember when I got it. The display no longer worked so we purchased this one as it had most of the same features and was the same wattage. I noticed immediately that it takes nearly twice as long to cook or reheat as the older one. Checked the watts used and found it was only drawing 850 watts. Did not get any satisfaction from repair services. They put me through the test described in the manual (heating water) and since the water heated in the given amount of time, they said it was working ok. It's not. It works but slowly. I did not get what I paid for."
2,Unengaging,"Despite its great title and some good lines, this book remains a bit unengaging. Potential buyers should be aware that it is an extremely thin and relatively flimsy paperback with no color illustrations, only workman-like black and white sketches. Also, while the protagonist's complaints against the day are humorous and sometimes resonate, there is no real theme, much less moral. The book is adequate for light reading, but its unappealing appearance means that it is not for everyone. We were disappointed by this book, whose actual appearance we were not able correctly to envision online."
3,A significant book in history,"Erskine Childers' The Riddle of the Sands is an unusual book: one that deserves to be read, not for the entertainment value it carries now (which is only mediocre, at best) but for the historical import it carries with it. It was written at the turn of the century, and the author meant to convey a real situation and what he concieved of as an emergency to the British public. It worked: the premise of the book led to significant changes in British Naval policy within a few years.The book itself is well-written from the style point of view, but the plot is sort of tame, and the suspense is rather shallow by modern standards. For all intents, from that point of view, it compares most favorably with some of Hammond Innes' Novels, which are good sea-adventure stuff also."
2,A powerful flop!,"The title (Riddle of the Sands) is exotic but beyond that - it is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw one"
3,No limit,"I thought I knew most recipes for cookies - this book has shown me that I was nowhere as knowledgeable as I thought. Great, easy to follow instructions."
1,disappointed!,"I'm so glad I only got this book out of the library. I would want my money back if I had paid for it! Granted I am only trying my first recipe from it now (Linzer Roll Cookies), but the directions are contradictory and full of errors. For instance, the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough. So we go from one square to some rectangles. So Nick, which one is it supposed to be? I guess I'll just have to wing it! Hello, isn't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff? I'll stick with the King Arthur Flour, their new cookie book is fabulous as is their Complete Baking book."
1,Lets just say it's not good.,"I hadn't even realized this book was still in print. Leaving any content issues aside, this is an extremely poorly written book. The characters are stilted, the perspective changes for no apparant reason and the prose is somewhat less than enthralling. In fact, to me it is one of those books that you keep reading just to see how bad it can get."
1,"piece of junk, don't buy","i bought this gun thinking it would be a very cool gun. i enjoyed shooting it at things in my house. . . at first. . . the light and laser are very cool and work well, but, on the same day i bought the gun, it broke. the slide came right off and the trigger literally broke off and fell out of the guard. it always got jammed with BBs and the magazine broke after 5 times shooting all of its ammo. very cheap, crappy gun. i hope this review will be a help to any future people that get scammed into buying a ""cool gun"" (not true at all) by this cheap company."
2,Too narrow!,"I really wanted to buy a bunch of these, but they are just too narrow.They are substantially more narrow than all the outlet plates in our house, which is a 3-year old home in Texas. I figured wall plates were a pretty standard size, but apparently not. There's no way that anyone would be happy with how these fit in our house."
5,fantastic solution for a 1 year old,"My 1 year old, as I'm sure yours is as well, is very good a problem solving (puzzles). The crazy outlet plugs worked for about 30 seconds. This system requires about 2 min and a screwdriver to create outlets that cover themselves. No wandering covers to keep track of. I'm a huge fan, and have used them for all my outlet needs."
3,Good idea but doesn't work for all outlets,"This is a great idea, but you may have a problem using these.1) If the sockets don't stick out past the drywall, there is a much longer distance from the plug and the plate.2) If the plug doesn't fit tight, it will more likely fall out.3) Additionally, if you try and tighten the cover to bring the sockets closer to the plate, the moving windows no longer work."
1,"Great idea, but...","it didn't work in our outlets at all and I don't think there is anything so unusual about our outlets. The plate held the plug too far away to make contact so that it could draw current. Very safe, but not very useful. We gave up and went back to the little inserts. Oh well."
5,Works great,Nothing to say - works perfectly. Works as described in product review. Would buy again. nice product. thanks thanks thanks
3,Hard to keep things plugged in,"These install really easy and do a good job of covering the outlet so the kiddies don't get their fingers shocked. However, certain plugs have a hard time staying in. Our vacuum and breast pump now have to be plugged in around the corner because they won't stay in with these covers on the outlet. So if you plan on frequently using whatever outlet you're covering then you probably want to look elsewhere."
4,Fine portrait of the immigrant experience,"Henry Roth was a truly talented writer and I feel frustrated as a reader that there are only a few books of his to read. However, ""Call it Sleep,"" is a wonderfully full and vibrant novel about a poor Eastern European Jewish family that settles in the Lower East Side slums of New York. David is the protagonist, a small, fearful, and imaginative boy who must contend with the fast moving intensity and danger as a foreigner in New York. He is surrounded by moving characters, such as his brutish and impatient father, who struggles to support his family or Aunt Bertha, the sanguine flirt who represents the peace and comfort of the old world. I don't ordinarily enjoy these kinds of sociological novels, but Roth is able to conjure up breathtaking images, and he paints his canvas with fascinating dialects with encompass the multi-culturism of American life. ""Call it Sleep,"" is truly a neglected piece of depression-era literature."
2,Unlikeable characters,"Bought this book for book club. Excellent portrayal of life in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side of Manhattan for poor immigrants. Although the accents are realistic, sometimes they are a bit difficult to translate. Don't recommend because I don't like any of the characters."
4,The Immigrant Experience,"In Call It Sleep, David Schearl, the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, straddles between his Yiddish background and the American culture. The dialogues in the novel--Yiddish written in prose and English in dialect--highlight the clash and synthesis of the two worlds. It is the essential immigrant experience, to straddle between two cultures, to struggle with identity, and ultimately to reconcile and integrate the two into a new creation.Manhattan's Lower East Side has been a microcosm of the ""melting pot"" where Jews, Irish, Italians, Greeks, Chinese, Puerto Ricans and Russians mingle and yet retain their unique identities. Often, second and third generations move to more affluent neighborhoods, but this place remains ""ground zero"" for the dynamics of cultural synthesis. Henry Roth in Call It Sleep gives a glimpse of that cultural dynamics for the Jewish community. An essential novel for the immigrant experience."
3,"Interesting, but only superficially connected to House M.D.","This book is more of a treatise on modern medical practice, rather than a book specifically about the medicine depicted on the TV show.It is interesting on it's own terms, and well written. But if you are hoping -- as I was -- for a sort of episode-by-episode critique of the medicine as depicted on House, you will be disappointed."
2,Not what i expected.,It's a great book for people who are interested in medicine.It 's not for medical doctors...
1,"The Medical Science of House, M.D.","The Medical Science of House, M.D.In attempt to ride off the Fame of The ""House, M.D.,"" series this book tries and fails to draw parrallels between actual medical conditions and vague references to the series. The author probably felt that the book and its contetents did not have sufficient merit to go it alone. It may make a good read, but it does not truly establish a bond with the series that author had hope to capture and nurture."
1,I bought this not as a toy,"I used this product for 20 minutes, and it jammed.I did not want to force the frame, as it is plastic. I called the seller and returned the product the next day. It worked very well for 20 minutes. I did not realize the product was considered a toy."
1,Wouldn't Buy It,"First of all I don't know why you classify this as a toy. Most of all, I wouldn't waste my money on this again. It miscounts the coins and does not snap back into place properly after removing the coin wrappers. It takes a few times to get it lined up again. I had a cheaper one for many years and wish I still had it. Worked much better that this one."
2,good when it works,this is not a bad product for what I wanted it for. That said it did stop working for no apparent reason. I have returned it to the manufacture as it is still covered under a 90 day warranty. Only problem was that it cost half the product price just to ship it back. I would be very careful in purchasing this item.
3,CARL heavy duty 3-hole punch,"We had purchased this same item a few months ago and are very pleased with it overall. I wanted to know durability and functionality.The analysts just love it because they can punch more papers at a time, that is why we purchased 2 more of the same product. Has cut down on shoulder strain.Would like information on replacement parts -- have worn out template and punch head on one side for product purchased last year."
4,Super easy to set up!,"Very easy to set up and roomier than you would think. You do have to stake this tent down, it won't standup without it so it can be difficult if you are on sand, rock or other places where staking is difficult but I have slept in it in all of those circumstances and always figured a way to tie it down or something. Very light, it's about 2.5 feet long when all packed up and it is sometimes a little tricky to roll tight enough for the sleeve. I have only been in light rain in this tent (live in Arizona) but never felt a drop. I would definitely recommend this to the single person or couple who are hobby campers."
3,Good for the Price,"I bought this tent as a temperary one sleeper. It is good for the price you pay for it. The bottom of the tent is made of the same mesh that the tent is made out of so it is not waterproof. You need soft enough ground for your pegs, otherwise the tent will not function properly. This would be great for one person and okey for two smaller people (one person would sleep the best.) This is not bad considering the price. I would also only use it if I knew there was going to be good weather and if it was not going to be too cold. Other than that, I would say this is an overall good purchase for the price."
5,One of a kind,I read way too many murder mysteries and procedurals. This is the only one I've ever read three times just because I love reading it.
4,Couldn't put it down,"If you like compelling thrillers, Thomas Perry is your man- at least with this book and the sequel- Sleeping Dogs. I discovered this book when it was first pulished, and spent a number of years trying to find it after it went out of print. Now it is back, and I no longer have my copy because I loaned it to a thriller loving friend. Shouldn't really like the book- the ""hero"" is a hit man who is truly amoral, and yet somehow you still get engaged with him. The writing is lean and moves the story at a perfect pace. I love deep books about complex charcters, but for relaxation give me a well written page turner anytime. And this book is just that. I recommend reading both books, as I think the story becomes fully fleshed only in Sleeping Dogs. Then move on to the Jane Whitfield novels- great plotting and writing and the heroine is truly that."
1,The Butcher's Boy,"To call it trite would be to give it too much credit. Ridiculously contrived ending. The main charecter added nothing to the story. I cannot think of a more poorly written book. Perhaps the author is waiting for some action from Hollywood. Do not waste your money on this, and if you get it free, do not waste your time."
1,Couldnt finish it,"Virgin seemed like an interesting movie, but half way through I couldnt finish it. Even with its tough topic and Moss' great performance, the movie failed to catch me attention."
4,nice rigoletto,"Callas sings an excellent Gilda here. She does sound a little old to me however, to sing a teenager. But the technique and stage presence is wondrous. I would get this set before it gets out of print."
5,one of the best..,"Yes, the Duke's cabaletta 'Possente amor mi chiama' is missing, which leaves a palpable gap to listeners brought up on the complete version. Yes, Gobbi misses out the unwritten high A for his final 'maledizione'. But that's just quibbling; everything in between is wonderful.Callas sings like the girl Gilda is supposed to be, imho it's between her and Cotrubas for the best Gilda on record. And Gobbi must be heard to be believed. He trumps Milnes, Capuccili, Bruson and all the other modern recordings. Only di Stefano is a bit of a let down, he is obviously not quite on the level of his co-stars, but he adds the optional high notes that Domingo eschews.A first Rigoletto would probably be the lovely Domingo/Cotrubas version, if only for the better sound, but this is, despite the age, a very very close second."
3,Needs Updating,I got this book sometime last year. It was a good book to read but it seems like it needs to be updated. The priciples are the same put techniques and products often change or are upgraded.
5,We really are tribal at work and in life...eye opening,"As a 20+ year student of management and leading people in the workplace, I believe Rays work has significant value for anyone that is looking to build a better world for the people they lead. I am no expert but I am filled with desire to cultivate a significant experience for those that I work with and around. Rays work is written in the style of ""The Goal"" and does a magnificent job describing the theories and providing examples of real life application. We all exhibit tribal behavior in our lives and Ray has given us a guide to leverage this to build a better life experience for those we work with and lead. If you are passionate about leadership and quality of life at work, study and apply this guide. Go deeper than a casual read. It may change your life. A great guide for anyone working with a TOC implementation. Any comments are welcome."
1,Using Tupac and Biggie's names to sell books!,"This was an interesting book about what was going on in the LAPD, but it does not discuss the topics that is titled to. The amount of information on Tupac is probably one page at most and Biggie maybe four or five. I felt that Det. Poole and R. Sullivan were more about getting back at the LAPD (not that his information is not valid) than discussing the details about Tupac and Biggie's murders. This books title should be LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the L.A.P.D. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for answers or information about Tupac, cause you won't find it. If you want to know more about the L.A.P.D., this is a great book."
5,ascot anyone,"silk on one side patterned cashmere on the other,off white pure style. I shall wear it as an ascot tucked in a shirt, sweater, vest. Chicks dig it or not It's still style."
5,Film noir lives,Great film noir. follows the story and Mitchun does a fantastic job. It being in color does not distract. Super.
4,Mitchum at his best,"Compared to Dick Powell's Philip Marlowe (""Murder, My Sweet""), Robert Mitchum hits most of the right notes with Raymond Chandler's classic noir character. The plot was adjusted, as was a lot of the language, but all the basics of noir were there: dark shadows, seamy characters and scenes, and characters, especially Marlowe, caught up in a series of events they don't quite understand and cannot control. Charlotte Rampling is terrific as the bored wife of an elderly, wealthy man."
5,The One You Really Want,"It is so nice to read a book that is good all the way through and not just building up to a point where the last ten pages only are good.The last ten pages ARE good, but so are the 2 or 3 hundred before it!Her real to life situations are realistic, not outrageoulsly silly. Even when her main character is not being laugh-out-loud funny(which she is-alot!)its still consistently entertaining. I've found each of her books to be better than the last. As an American, I just wish I understood British English slang a lttle better! 5 stars"
2,Very Disappointed,"So we needed a new phone for the house and another for my home office...We purchased a 2431 with one extra handset and a 2461 with two extra handsets. Neither phone had sufficient range to go from one side of our house to a room on the other side and deliver static free, stutter free voice. We found that, no matter where we placed the base unit, you had to be within 15-20 feet of the base in order to get decent reception.Oh, and the speaker phone??? Let's just say that you are going to want to be in a very quiet room in order to hear the people on the other end, even at full volume, but wow, hit a key and the tone from the phone nearly basts you away. Yet another engineering defect.Summary: Exceedingly poor range, bad voice, bad handsfree, poor display visibility, attention to detail lacking. Avoid these units. We are on our way to the return line."
2,It's ok -- handset menu is clunky,"We have been using this model as our main phone for almost a year and I'm here shopping for another, we will move this one to a bedroom. Main gripe -- we can't quite get use to the menu system -- get lost easily and it beeps at you. For example, finding a number in memory requires unintutitive keystrokes. I don't like fighting with my phone! Also -- when cradling the phone against my shoulder, I have inadvertantly muted the phone several times from my cheekbone pushing the menu button. Since the UI is clunky, I frantically try to unmute it and of course the caller thinks we have lost our connection. Lastly, you never want to lose the owners manual, because you'll never figure out how to program the phone without it. On the good side: Reception is fine, the speakerphone in the handset is really good."
5,works great,"I've had this phone for about a year now, and the only thing I can complain about is that it doesn't have an answering machine in it. After reading other reviews on this phone I've noticed many people complaining about the range of it. For me the range is great. I'm able to go anywhere in the house and outside with it. Yes after some distane I start getting static, but that's going through concrete and a few walls. If you need something that goes beyond 100 feet, why don't you just use a cell phone?"
2,Problem handsets,"I was attracted to the VTech because you could add additional handsets and use the intercom feature from handset to handset, which was convenient. The accessory handset failed after less than 2 weeks and the keypad wouldn't respond - couldn't dial or answer the phone. I exchanged the handset. The base handset then stopped ringing, not too convenient when you're in the yard, expecting a call, and the phone doesn't ring. I returned the phone. Two malfunctions in less than 4 weeks. On the plus side, I thought programming was very intuitive."
2,Problematic at the least,"I may have had this phone for more than most people... It worked GREAT the first few months. Then by month 10 it no longer rang. This would be and continues to be my only problem. I returned it to vtech, they sent me a brand new phone and receiver. Took about a month unfortunately. This phone [didn't work either] and now im trying to consider buying something else or keeping this phone. I really like it but who wants a phone which doesnt ring?"
2,Sound Quality is not as Good as Expected,I've been pretty much hooked on V-techs until I bought this phone. The sound quality is poor. It always has a constant hum in your ear. You almost feel like your listening to the inside of a box. I was very disappointed.
4,Pretty good phone...,"At first I was a little hesitant to buy this phone because it only had an average of three stars, but it had the features I wanted at a reasonable cost so I took a chance...I like the phone. The sound quality is good (not great), and the range is very good. I can wander all through the house without breaking up or losing quality. There is a little background ""hum"" (some others have also reported this), but that may be because it sits on my desk next to my computer, scanner, lamp, etc. The noise isn't distracting though...The speakerphone on the base is very good (not great) and is clear both ways. The coolest feature has to be the speakerphone on the handset. The handset is pretty small (cell phone size) so you could easily get a cramp in your neck if you had to hold it there for too long. You can put the handset down on the counter (or desk, or whatever) and still carry on your conversation without risking neck injury..."
3,Nice features but no range,"After reading reviews of the vtech and other similar 2.4Ghz products I had many concerns. At the store, the sales person was very negative about Siemens(sp?) and suggested vtech. As others have pointed out, the vtech is very good looking and has many features. It does not have the range of a 900 mhz DSS. In side by side comparison and with the vtech plugged into various locations, the vtech would reach about 100 ft outside the house while the 900 would reach over 200 ft. If range is your primary cocern this is not the phone for you. Otherwise, the phone performs well around the house. There is a very minor back-ground hiss regardless of location. Despite the warnings I ended up putting the base close to my computer - same circuit and phone jack. It seems to work as well there as other locations."
2,not so hot,i bought this phone because it looked pretty cool and it's features. the full duplex speaker phone is great...and so is the 2.5mm jack on the phone so that you can connect a headphone. and the base has a very small profile.but... the range on this phone isn't so hot. my older sony 900mhz spread spectrum phone has a better range than this 2.4ghz phone...which i was a bit surprised at. and the sound quality on the handset is poor.if i had to do it all over again...i'd probably try another brand.
1,Looks better then it is,"was very anxious to get this phone & its features...however once we set it up the phone ""hums"" & has a slight echo...we exchanged it for another & moved it in different places around the house....i would pass on this one"
4,Great Toddler Reading!,"This book is wonderful. The younger children love the lilting meter of the poetry and the repetitive phrasing. Aside from the somewhat creepy and androgenous main character, the illustrations are beautiful. The pictures show the animals hiding, allowing older children to guess the animal before it is revealed on the following pages. Older children are also able to recite along with the repetitive phrasing, allowing them to feel like real ""readers."""
1,Returned the book,"If what you're looking for is a book full of repeating stats, then this may be your book. As it is, several of the guns have errors in the history section (i.e. Colt is still making the 1911) and they even duplicate some guns in whole (i.e. Beretta M9 and 92 are seperate entries). The book adds nothing to the game besides an unreliability mechanic, which is a seperate roll before you roll to hit, as opposed to building it into the to hit roll.(by this system, the gun jams just before you shoot it, as opposed to when you do.)The book was $20 discounted, and I'll probably lose money for sending it back, but it's not worth me keeping it."
3,"Comprehensive, but Necessary?. . .",I own this book only because someone had bought it for me as a gift because I'm a huge fan of the d20 Modern line. Now I'm a more story geared GM meaning I have the players try to find solutions instead of fighting all the time. So obviously when my players saw this all this went out the window... I can admire all the guns and in fact being a gun nut irl I found alot of favorites. Considering all the games I like running or X-files/Conspiracy games.
4,great watch for the price,"I needed an inexpensive watch for a trip I was taking and snatched this up in a hurry. So far so good. Seems to keep good time, looks classy without being over the top. Only problem for me: I have small wrists and I can slip the watch on over my hand without unbuckling. It swims around my wrist so it's good that the crystal is a good material. I would buy Invicta again anytime."
1,This edition does not match product description in any way,"The Product Description promises ""these beautiful books feature a ribbon bookmark, a specially designed jacket with metallic ink and a peep-through window to the fullcolor case, and full-color artwork on cream-colored stock"". What you get is NO bookmark, a regular dust jacket with no die-cut and no metallic ink, and white paper stock, not cream.Also, if you spend any length of time actually reading this edition, you will quickly notice that the text appears to be very slightly blurred, as if this was printed on an old laser-printer."
2,Not so helpful,"If you know your way around most toolbars, this book won't teach you much. It has been written for people who haven't used any complex software before. I had to buy the book for a course on Flash, but was disappointed when we covered most of the book in the first day. Easy to understand for a complete beginner. May be useful then."
3,"Interesting, if sometimes dull, biography","Let's face it - most Americans, even history fans like myself, have trouble keeping our attention every page of a 700+-pg book. Credit Remini with making the life of Webster as interesting as to keep you hooked and reading till the end, wanting to find out more. Credit him as well with fine research - he seems to have read basically everything written by Webster that remains in one collection or another. This was all impressive, but keeping the material interesting and keeping the strength of the orations on paper are too much of a task even for him. I am not sure what non-history fans would think of this but I think it would definitely interest any others with even a passing interest in the heritage of our nation."
5,Easy reading mystery novel,I have enjoyed all of the books written by this author. It is easy reading and very relaxing.
3,Harness Review,"I've tried several harnesses for our 40+ pound bully breed mix. She has very short hair and most of the harnesses really chafe her armpits. I was hoping that the anti-pull harness would be a good alternative. She still pulled and was harder to control with this harness. I ended up buying the gentle leader harness that goes around her head similar to a horse bridle. This has been the only harness that has not chafed her, and I still have great control during the walk. The harness did not work for our dog, but hopefully it will for others' dogs."
1,I have taped them from tv - with better quality!,"Five stars for the films, no doubt about that. But even if I consider the age of these flicks, the DVD-quality is the WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!At times you can hardly make out what is happening on screen. I think they have used an old video taped version, cut out the commercials and transferred the film to DVD.Shame on the makers of these DVD's! My advice is not to buy them: they are too expensive for what they offer."
1,Fell apart within two years,"You will see this remote for sale on various sites on the internet. It is cheaply made and does not stand up under normal use. The one I purchased was chrome plated plastic like the one pictured. It is made from very thin plastic and within one year the entire chrome plating was worn off under normal use. Just after one year the plastic loop that the key ring attaches too wore off completely hence no way to attach keys. The soft button area that has all the controls, press this a little to hard and the entire button area caves in, as mine did. So in less than two years this remote is completely unusable whereas the original remote lasted over 10 years and was stolen but still worked well. I plan to replace this with a good used Infiniti remote or a new OEM remote."
2,Mono mix adds much sorrow to this CD reissue.,"Why!? Why did they have to remaster this brilliant album in ear-bludgeoning MONO!?!? This extremely stupid decision defeats the whole purpose of digital remastering, which provides a more expansive, almost 3-D effect to a stale stereophonic mix - giving each instrument and voice a separate, clearly defined space and enhancing the overall sound immensely. I experienced a similar disappointment with a remastered Colloseum CD (Valentyne Suite) that sounds absolutely horrible in mono. At least give the consumer a choice between mono or stereo. Better yet, include BOTH mixes on one CD. The music on this classic album deserves 5 stars. This particular reissue, however, gets a measly 2 stars for its ""purist"" insanity. Grrrrrrrr!!!"
3,Its Seams are Showing,"""S.F. Sorrow"" does rightly deserve credit for being the first rock opera. However, the Who got it right one year after this release with ""Tommy"".The album was recorded on four tracks and it shows. Plus why was it remastered in mono?! It has some interesting experimentation with the sitar and mellotron plus some great guitar distortions typical of psychedelic music. Nevertheless...Producer/Engineer Norman Smith did better work with ""Srgt Pepper"" and ""Pide Piper"". Though The Beatles and Pink Floyd also worked with limited resources, as the technology of the time was primitive, the music and sound quality on both albums were infinitely better.""S.F. Sorrow"" is worth a listen, though. It serves as a memento of psychedelic rock of the 60's."
2,"as others have said, WHEN it worked, it was neat","we were pleased with it for the first couple of months but then it started sporadically not being able to communicate with the outside unit. we would move it, it would work, then it would quit. the outside unit has not stopped showing the correct temp but the inside unit has not shown the correct temp, time, humidity etc. for nearly 9 months. why did it take me so long to write a review? one, because i forgot.... and two because i kept thinking it was in a temporary mode of not communicating. but when i passed by it this morning on my way to the computer, i had to log in and write this real quick.i am disappointed because it was so neat those first couple of months to be able to tell the humidity before ever opening the back door. oh well, guess we can always do it the old fashioned way."
2,Disappointing and not recommended,"I was disappointed by this Oregon Scientific product. I've listed the reasons below.The outdoor sensor doesn't measure humidity. Perhaps the packaging said something to this effect, but it certainly wasn't obvious (I don't have the packaging anymore to check).The plastic packaging was VERY hard to open. I had to use a pocket knife, and I came close to cutting myself.The instructions are very poorly written. Yeah, I got the thing working eventually, but only after cursing the people who wrote the instructions. You'd think that the company would expend at least SOME effort to make sure that the directions were clear and unambiguous.The directions say that the remote (outdoor) sensor doesn't work well in very cold weather (because the batteries don't function well). Well, since I live in the northeast, very cold weather is common here. If I knew this in advance, I wouldn't have bought the unit.I can't recommend this product. There must be something better available."
2,"Same old, same old...","I was excited to hear this mix from the reviews I had read. If you're tired of the same old mixes from GU and are craving something different, you don't need this one- you already have it. It starts out interesting enough and then goes in to the standby sound of every other DJ on the label. Kinda boring. I was ready for something more funky- more ""hip-hop and acid jazz"" influenced. This is not it. It's definitely not a bad mix, but it's nothing different than what you've already heard. I would suggest buying Thievery Corporation's ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" or Boom Bip's ""Seed To Sun."" They're not DJ mixes, but they're fantastic."
1,Simply Dreadful,"Just terrible! Although her voice has mellowed and is quite beautiful, Ms Te Kanawa has absolutely no instinct or feel for this distinctly American music. She's just lost in her own peculiar Kiwi wonderland. She is not aided but what have to be some of the worst arrangements of this music ever recorded.Her version of ""What'll I do"" alone earns her a place on the top ten list of abominable recordings of American music."
5,Brilliant service,The product came quicker than was recommended in the email and the book was in excellent condition. Great price also
2,not what I expected,"I thought I ordered this from Wilderness Family Naturals. When it arrived it was from a different supplier, unlabeled, in 2 half gallons instead of one gallon, and it has the coconut taste and smell so it is clearly not the grade I ordered, and I have no idea what I actually received. In the future I will only order directy from Wilderness Family Naturals website, where I have always gotten exactly what I ordered. I will not order this product from amazon again."
3,Not Sure?,I just got this oil today and tried it out. It's not white like my Aloha Nu. It's more of a creamy color. No taste at all. I'll be using this oil just for cooking. The jury is still out on this oil?!
3,This text is the first edition,"The original format or first edition of this text was atrocious. It was peppered with triumphalist 'Catholic' comments. However, the revised and expanded edition in Two Volumes (1. China, 2. Japan)- about to be reprinted and expanded yet again, was a brilliant and sensitive work, written with a much humbled outlook, full of useful references and summaries. Don't waste money on the old text (some s/hand copies sell for up to $50 dollars. In a matter of months, the new edition will be available - and, well worth buying."
2,Good until page 86,"I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class. I found it interesting, but hard to read. Mill tends to be repetative and wordy. He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway. I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster. At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization."
5,Almost the best,"Only the live recording with Callas, del Monaco and Taddei is better!!! (Also available on Amazon)"
4,wood block chipped,"I got mine the other say. I tried to cancel my order but it was too late. I was going to get the (cheaper) older model before this one (Henckel Four Star) since one of the reviewers claims that they're just about the same except for the fancy metal. I couldn't tell the difference but this one looked more appealing and classic to me. And since I already have the 8"" breadknife l accepted the order and l love the set. However, the wood block has a small chip right in front. I thought about returning it but it's too much hassle and I wanted to use it right away. Overall the woodblock looked nice than I thought as it's not a typical wood rather a bamboo wood block."
5,cool looking product,got this product for my dad for this holiday season.he liked it...a lot.. its totally value for money. looks more expensive than it is..
3,I like it,"When I was looking for some new music, I was searching bands like The Penetrators, the Ghastly Ones etc. Then these guys popped up and I bought it based on it's reviews. It has a pretty cool sound and I do not find myself skipping through the songs. I never spend my money on things that I am not sure if I'll like it, I took a chance and I am not disappointed. I hope this is a good example, a few songs reminds me of that Spanish guitar style music, but Russian. It's cool. I like it!! Just buy it."
5,OVS review,This was a gift to my 11 year old granddaughter. She is really enjoying this guide. Highly recommend this as a good source of information on the saints.Wish it had more pictures of the saints.
1,very disappointing,"I was terribly disappointed by this movie. I mean: Laurence Olivier! Gregory Peck! Nazis! Hitler clones! This should be great!Oh well. The script is a predictable stinker. Peck and Olivier seem slightly embarrassed. And Boy Hitler, sheesh. Evil Movie Children should be quietly ominous. This one is just a vulgar, annoying brat.If you're still thinking about seeing this movie, I have two words for you: Steve Guttenberg. He's in it. Excruciating."
2,Blu-ray transfer is great,"Other reviewers are right about ordering this blu-ray from the amazon.co.uk website if amazon.com sellers are charging over 20 dollars for it. the transfer is great. I hadn't seen the film since it came out, and though I remember it not being too good when I saw it then, I had not realized how bad it is until i watched it again. It's cool to see Laurence Olivier play a Nazi hunter in this film after seeing him as an escaped Nazi dentist in Marathon Man. But just watch Marathon Man again. I wish it were out on blu-ray1"
3,Interesting....for the wrong reasons.,"This film is an interesting and amusing one...but not in the way it tries so hard to be. Far from being a riveting and terrifying plot, the idea of a cloned evil person (replicated 64 times) is amusing--particularly when the 'evil person' is a self centered adolescent, spoiled by doting parents. I was, instead of being terrified by this idea, struck by how much the 14-year-old reminded me of the kids at the local shopping mall. And by how much the final scene show-down between the Aryan and the Jews resembles a meeting of our local planning commission. Intended to be a threatening glance into hell-on-earth, this film is a trivial performance by great actors and the enlightment of its message is reduced to the banal when compared to the conflicts and social trends of the world in which we live in the year 2001."
1,Is this someone's idea of a joke?,"I am a big fan of Peck and Olivier, and I was eager to see this movie so I ordered it as soon as it came out on DVD. What a disappointment. The plot is so ridiculous and the screenplay is terrible. Maybe the book was better but I don't feel like reading it anymore. What a waste of a great cast. Olivier's performance is believable but that's it. And I mean IT. Nothing else is enjoyable in this waste of time and space on my DVD shelf. Poor Peck tries but sometimes I laugh when he recites some of his lines ""kill za boy"" and he is such a cliché taken out of a comic book. Avoid at any cost. Bad bad bad.One Good thing though. Steve Guttenberg gets killed early in the movie. The pain was reduced."
4,A Fine Document Of Their Tribute Tour,"This CD is pretty good. The Lynyrd Sknyrd Band does their best to deliver the goods. Guitarist Ed King sounds incredible and the songs featuring guests like Steve Morse and Toy Caldwell are stellar. Freebird is truly moving with the audience singing for the late Ronnie Van Zant and Ed King does an incredible job peforming Allen's solo on it.However, if there is only one thing that keeps this CD from getting 5 stars is Johnny Van Zant's lack of his big brother's vocal muscle."
2,cute but not well made,"The set is as cute as it looks in the picture but did not fare the test of time very well. I got it for my daughter, who was not particularly tough on it at all, and it fell apart after about a year. The bumper ties ripped, the sheets got thin from washing, etc."
3,Not for everybody,I am sure the exercises on this DVD are effective but I just did not see myself doing them consistently. Ended up giving this to a friend
3,Nice looking shoes but a bit narrow,"I liked these shoes they looked good. However, I have many other pairs of Allen Edmonds and for the same width these were not as wide which made them uncomfortable."
5,Strange Language Songs,"Imagine a jam with Adam Clayton from U2 in the Bass, Price in the guitar, Moby in the keyboard, the guys from The Crystal Method making some crazy effects with old synthesizers, Dr.Dre and the The Chemical Brothers programming the drum beats, people around the world making strange voices in different styles and languages! Recorded, mixed and mastered by a creative electronic music producer! Sounds crazy but this is what really comes to my mind about this album!"
3,"The Raft Barely Stays Afloat, If You Get My Drift","Mr. Trumbull did an adequate job of documenting Chief Petty Officer Dixon's narration of their 34-day raft ordeal. The writing is very straight forward with little in the way of colorful prose. It reads almost like a military dissertation. Mr. Trumbull's writing style certainly wouldn't have been mistaken for John Updike's work. The retelling is also indicative of 1940's sensibilities and presentations. For example, the author and Officer Dixon avoided any use of profanity in the book. They alluded to it, but dodged actual usage of ""colorful adjectives"" as if they were monks in a monastry. Without question, the three men survived by a mixture of luck and moxie. Their odyssey is so compelling, it was easy to finish this novella. However, the writing is so bland, I would not have stuck with the story if the book had been twice its actual length. The Raft is a fine example of human endurance."
1,no good!!!!,I went to a store close by and I got a better one at 1/2 price and it didn't take a week to get here...... it wasn't worth the money or the time spent waiting ...
2,$32.95 for A Poorly Designed Book With No Javelin Coverage?,"I'm completely amazed the author failed to provide any Javelin coverage! I can see the justification for leaving out Hammer coverage, but the javelin?! While I found the Certificates & Forms material to be a bonus, this book isn't worth $32.95. There are far better books out there for half the price."
1,"Unfortunately, this video was a dissappointment","These scenes are not truly 'banned from tv.' In fact I've seen many of these scenes on tv. The violence is not very graphic at all. There are maybe one or two deaths that occur, but you don't really see them. The most graphic thing is the nudity, which is nothing compared to the pornos you can rent at a local video store."
5,Marvellous!,"This is the definitive prog-rock album, with all it's keyfeatures such as odd time signatures, great melodies and fantastic keyboard solos, along with themes that returns at different places in different songs."
2,Attention: The DVD only for Region 1,Attention! The buyer who belongs to a place that is not inside the Region 1 will not be able to visualize the DVD.In our global world serious desirable to end once and for all with these disadvantages.
3,Not for DVD-A players,"This review pertains to the DVD-A, not the music. Despite being a ""DVD"", you can't play this on a DVD-A or DTS 5.1 player in a car. I have an 2008 Acura with this system, and the DVD disk could not be played. I was very disappointed, and felt a bit ripped off. The DVD portion is for the video that comes on the same disk. That sort of made-up for it. You get an audio disk as well and the remix is better than the orginal CD release that I have from 1990. So if you have a DVD audio player in your car, don't bother with this release."
3,I know that it's famous,"I know that this book is famous and everything, but it's not an easy read, and i remain unconvinced. Having said that, i'm just a first year so what do i know~!"
5,An Important Book,"For anyone who is worried about money, which means pretty much everyone, this is the book to buy and to live by. Whether you are single or married, with children or without, the book teaches you how to get control over your finances and get ahead, not by counting pennies, but by giving you a whole new way of thinking about your money and where it goes. The book is written for real people. It is clear, lively, compassionate, often funny, and wise."
5,Simple,"Elizabeth Warren presents a very simple, matter of fact way to approach your finances. I agree with the other reviewers... If you want to change your situation than this book is for you. This book helped me identify the motivation behind a lot of my spending habits and helped me find a lot of areas that could be improved."
3,A few good ideas,"This book has a couple of really good ideas, but overall I was disappointed. The 50/30/20 rule was the most useful idea in the book. Some things I absolutely do not agree with - like keeping a $1000.00 emergency fund in your regular ""Must-Haves"" checking account. That's a disaster waiting to happen. Let's face it -- if you're reading the book, financial discipline is probably not your finest quality. If that money is that available, it's TOO available.The basic premise of the book is good, however, and bit more nitty-gritty than most books on the same subject. Many such books are written for those who already have some funds to play with - this one is to help you get to where you have those funds. With the exception of a few ideas that seem out of step with the overall concepts, the book is worth a read."
4,Humor for the Computer Age,"Having grown up in the computer age, I found this book a funny but realistic look at the way people today keep relationships alive. Most of us use e-mail to keep in touch with people near and far, but these two do it with humor and light-heartedness. I really enjoyed reading this book and have been inspired to be more creative with my own e-mails!"
4,"Information Rich, Image Modest","Jane Blocker has done an exquisite job of her research and documentation of not only Ana Mendieta, but other realted artists pertaining to related areas of interest. I found this text to be deeply insightful. As one who has recently become interested in the work and life of Ana Mendieta, I found this book to be much more than an introduction to the ""earth/body""-oriented artist, but a document helpful enough for in depth study. The photos, however, are black and white, and scarce. If it's a full color collection of Ana Mendieta's work you are in search of, this is not the text you want. However, if you are looking for a deeply fascinating, clearly well educated and researched text documenting this fine artist, you've found your match."
5,sweet,"A very sweet story of a poor girl who somehow falls in love with perhaps the biggest bully in school.A sweet, addictive plot that will keep you entranced."
5,One of the Best films I've ever seen!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I noticed that many people were praising James Woods, and I admit that he is phenomanal in this film. But the person that stood out to me was Vincient Keithweiser (I don't think I spelled that right). He deserved just as much prise as James Woods got if not more. All of the actors did a excellent job in this film and it comes highly recommended from me and all my friends. But don't think this movie is a feel good romantic comedy, it's a very strong action\drama filled with drugs (mainly heroin), sex, violence, and all the drama you can fit into a 2 hour film. I even cried at a few parts (mainly becuse of Mr. Keithweiser's excellent acting during a few sections). Recommended for people 14 and up (if you're used to that kind of stuff in movies)"
3,Well-acted drama,"This ironically-titled movie is almost too intense to bear. The story about drug-addict criminals is realistic, but all the characters are foul-mouthed and repugnant. If a film could be rated X for profanity alone, this would receive the ""honor,"" since almost every sentence in the dialogue is laced with profanity of the worst sort."
4,"IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY, GO SEE IT","Definitely an excellent movie. James Woods did a great portrayal of Mel, the man who shows the kids the ropes. Melanie Griffith played the character of Sid so wonderfully that it almost made me wish she was my mother. I would have given this movie five stars if it hadn't been for Natasha Gregson Wagner's, although very well acted, extremely annoying version of Rosie. The real surprise was the backbone of the film, Bobbie, played brilliantly by Vincent Kartheiser."
2,Oppressor - 'Solstice Of Oppression' (Red Light),"'Solstice...' is the Chicago death metal band's first out of four CD's.The vocals here are nearly incomprehensible.Some decent riffs on this disc,I'll give them that much.Line-up:Tim King-bass&vocals,Adam Zadel-guitar,Jim Stopper-guitar and Tom Schofield-drums.Sorry,not for me.Might possibly appeal to some fans,of say Cannibal Corpse,Obituary,Coven and Rigor Mortis."
1,Disappointed,"I picked up this book because of the glowing reviews, and was very disappointed. While the plot moved quickly and it was an easy read, the characters were flat and unbelievable. I couldn't even buy the bad guy, who wasn't anything more complex than a cartoon character."
5,Good for beginning readers,"""Purple Is Part of a Rainbow"" is a good book for children with developing vocabularies. In this book, the simple rhymes of Carolyn Kowalczyk are well complemented by the lovely artwork of Gene Sharp.The rhymes follow a standard format: ""A petal is part of a flower. / A rainbow is part of a shower. / A feather is part of a bird. / A letter is part of a word."" Each sentence is accompanied by an illustration. The colorful illustrations have a soft, gentle quality to them. Another nice touch is the fact that the artwork depicts people of various racial/ethnic characteristics.The educational value of the book is enhanced by a word list at the end. Overall, a well done collaboration, with a wonderfully poetic title."
3,Preview review,"Just ordered this because my daughter has to write a paper for Spanish class about a famous Latino/a. She was given Raquel Welch as her subject, and there is almost NOTHING to be found about her that doesn't stress her sex symbol status to an extent inappropriate for a school assignment! Even if another reviewer states there are errors in that portion of this book, we apparently have few choices. I am also very disappointed to see--by a quick ""look inside"" at the index--that the late, groundbreaking comedian Freddie Prinze and his show ""Chico and the Man"" are nowhere mentioned. But there do seem to be a lot of other people I will be interested in reading about, as I have been fascinated with the culture since living in California as a child, right up to minoring in Spanish in college. So maybe this purchase will be worth it. I will probably amend my review to comment on that later."
2,mirror face,"I was looking for a inexpensive and easy fix to the side mirror on my 1999 buick regal. Researched and found on Anazon just an mirror face and ordered it. I would not recommend this fix for a heated mirror as mine was. A heated mirror has a liquid inside of it to conduct the current for heating and can be damaging to the paint and is almost impossible to remove the old mirror face without splashing the car,it will make ugly spots on a light colored car. If the mirror is unheated it works much betted. Heated mirrorshave a layer of clear glass on the outside and a hard plastic band around to seal in the liquid for heating and are very hard to disassemble for repair. Recommend for unheatedbut not for heated. Hope this helps."
4,Catchy pop,"I'm sure I'll lose people by throwing around the name 'the Mommyheads.' That was Adam Cohen (aka Adam Elk)'s previous band. This CD is very similar to their last, self-titled CD. I would recommend this CD to you if you liked the Mommyheads. But since most of you haven't even heard of the Mommyheads, I'll write a review.This is pop. Not radio pop, but pure pop. This has all the hooks you could ever want. Adam has an awesome tenor voice. It works well with the pop that he plays on this album. Most of the album doesn't feature guitar very much. Just chords on the guitar while the non-vocal melodies come from mostly the bass or keyboards of some sorts. There are a few songs that tend to be a little bit unlike the others. ""Big wheel"" is a hard-grooving funk song, but still with pop elements. ""Too Much of nothing"" is similar to ""Big Wheel"" in the funkiness.The only band besides the Mommyheads I could compare this to would be Fountains of Wayne, but with more soul and more hooks."
1,Boring,I expected better quality tracks from a producer. The tracks on this cd lack musicianship and creativity. They sound like the guy just discovered DnB. Simple samples thrown together that just don't sound good. Second time listening to the cd I skipped thru most of it. BORING!! Now I question Grooverider as an artist.
4,many stars in lucky stars,Thank Your Lucky Stars is a fun filled movie with many of the Warner Brothers stars of the 40^s. Lot of fun with Eddie Cantor and a host of stars singing and dancing including Errol Flynn and Bette Davis. If you enjoy good films I highly recommend this DVD.
4,A fun movie...,"I love the 40's movies.. especially musicals. So I really enjoyed ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"".. A lot of stars one will always remember. It is a very nice movie. It is a collection of stars that sing and dance and a wonderful dance number by Alexis Smith.. Someone I didn't remember did musicals. One will be surprised by routines done by great actors."
5,Rapid Rise,"Brandon Lee was well on his way to being the next huge action star..He had model good looks, an impeccable martial arts pedigree and talent to match, he could zing out sardonic one-liners with the best of them, and he was a fine actor, as well. This film features Brandon as an art student who witnesses a murder and is then caught between the Chinese and Italian mafias, the FBI, and the Chicago police department. Lee's martial arts style is unique and fun to watch--sort of a cross between Jackie Chan's acrobatics and Jason Statham's fisticuffs."
5,Brandon Lee In Explosive Martial Arts Action!!!,"Brandon Lee, an exceptional martial artist in his own right, stars in this Hong Kong style action movie. Full of flying feet, guns blasting, and bombs blowing up. Lee shows us his skills in kung fu and Muay Thai as he goes up against the Italian mafia and the Chinese triads. His physical abilities are incredible, with his body sculpted to near perfection, like his father, Bruce Lee. Lee keeps up the legend using his father's style but he also takes it a step further when he combines it with Jackie Chan's style when he engages in battle. Also full of amazing stunts this movie is a must watch if you are an action fan, martial arts fan, or a fan of the legendary Lees. It is sad that Brandon Lee is gone, but in ""Rapid Fire"" and his other movies, he will live forever."
2,not what I expected,"These light bulbs came quickly and I was happy to put them in, but we have had problems with flickering (even after warmed up sometimes)and they DO NOT work on a dimmer switch."
4,Baz Luhrmann's Rock n Roll Shakespeare really Rocks!!!,"This is the Leo DiCaprio / Claire Danes ""RnJ"" - a zippy, clever, & brutal rendition of Shakespeare's most popular play! There's much to appreciate in this tour de force; everyone's firing on all cylinders, thanks to Baz's scintillating, effervescent direction. Keep your sunglasses handy; things can get blinding from time to time..."
2,"I don't think Shakespeare's rolling in his grave, but...","Maybe my viewing experience of this film was tainted when, while seeing it in the theatre, one of the 13 year old girls sitting in the row in front of me turned to the other and said, ""is Leo going to talk link this THE WHOLE TIME?"".For a Shakespeare purist (as I am myself), the problem is not the modernization of the setting and the use of the language in that setting (I personally love it), but it's the absolutle murder of the language by the majority of the cast that makes my skin crawl. This movie, in terms of the execution of the script, does a disservice in getting kids hooked on the poetry of Shakespeare's writing.However, I will admit that visually it's great. The setting is apt. Mercutio is amazing. But, teachers, I would think twice about showing this version to your class."
4,This is a Movie for the people who are made of passion,"This is a Movie for the people who are made of passion. Not only is the movie great, but the sound track is equally as heart throbbing. when I first saw this movie, it impressed me and stuck with me for along time. I use to think about how wonderful Sheakspear worked his words and how great it was for the director to mold it into a mega hit movie....."
3,REMEMBER! ROMEO IS THE BAD GUY!,"'house unfortunate they'd not 'derstand Romeo villanious lecher 't to destroy Capulet House 'owever. wimpish and unlikeable, cowardly, treasoness, anorectic...he seduces Juliet Capu...hey!, this is the wrong movie! Claire Danes only bright spot here...'ow bright she be, that shadow spark a man, aroma so pleasing....her supple not ending...'er e'er'thin'. Juliet......."
3,electrfying and nicely done,"a good version of the classic tradegy of Shakespeares work. Leo and Claire are cool as the two love birds who fall in love for one another. John Leguizamo snaps and sparks as Tybalt and Harold Perrineau Jr is simply wonderful as Mercutio, but did he have to do drag. some down falls along the way but it picks up with its grand acting. others will note that Jamie Kennedy, Paul Rudd, Diane Venora, Paul sorvino, Brian Dennehy, Dash Mihok, Christian Pickles and Miriam Margoyles also star as well. directed by Baz Luhrman(Moulin Rouge and Strictly Ballroom)"
1,I spent more money to see this film then they did to film it,"William Shakespeare must have been turning over in his grave after what they did to his popular tale. I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one. Leonardo and Claire are good actors, and in this peice of trash they play a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version."
1,Not William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,"I agree with Robert. The vast majority of the actors in this production quite obviously did not understand the words they were saying. This was an extremely poor adaptation of a great work. There are many, many good productions of Shakespeare's work, why did they feel the need to try to ""modernize"" such a great story?I found it to be absolutely pathetic. It would have been ""OK"" if the actors had actually understood the work."
1,way to kill a classic.,So many things were off from the play that is was pretty embarassing to watch.1)Romeo is supposed to be DEAD when Juliet awakens.2)the BALCONY scene is intended for the balcony not in the pool.3)And way to respect the Catholic religion with huge statues of Madonna.4)If you're going to do a modern version atleast not stuff tranvestites into people's faces or homosexuals (nothing wrong with them.)
2,disappointing in the long run,"around the time I was studying shakespeare in my high school days I enjoyed this movie cause I was biased toward leonardo dicaprio, but it's like a kitsch parody of the classic and I would recommend reading the book instead or watching a shakespearian play."
1,no justice to shakespeare,this movie simply does no justice to shakespeare. for those who have spent time studing him they know that his words are ULTRA important. in this movie they yell constantly. never between the feuding families do they speak to one another without yelling. it is possible to act angry and not yell. this movie was a great dissapointment to me. they skipped over all the little witty lines that make the play wonderful and just took out the guns to shoot people. skip it.
4,Very good modern re-telling of a classic story! Especially in Blu-Ray!,"Baz has done a great job on this modern re-telling of Shakespeare's classic story! My ex and I enjoyed the movie a lot when it first came out and now that I got this Blu-Ray, the quality is outstanding! Also, I recommend the soundtrack... it's a keeper.To buy or not to buy, that is your question!"
1,Very Bad.,"This 1990's version of the great play is very, very bad. I did not like DiCaprio as Romeo and the Shakespearean language seems so out of place for a 1990s setting. Avoid it."
1,Leonardo SUCKS!,"the whole film is absolutely ruined by the actors who can't act at all. It's a nice try of Luhrmann to combine the postmodern scenario with the Elizabethan language, and uses the images to replace the poetic sense, but the actors, almost none of them trained for a Shakespearean text, ruin the whole feeling of poetry within a world of violence thing. Esp Leonardo Dicaprio--he's like THE worst actor I have ever seen. I thought he looked stupid enough in Titanic,but his acting skill is just beyond imagination..."
1,"Sorry, but its a crappy movie","The acting:good, but..the movie is just horrible. I can't believe my english teacher from last year would show this when we were doing Romeo and Juliet. anyway, it is a bad movie in my opinion.thats all i got to say.END-"
1,Very bad indeed!,"this movie is not a good movie! Lifetime may, possibly, have less bathetic movies than this one! There is no genuine care displayed between the characters, it's a movie that comes off way too much as only that, just a movie, and a sappy one at that! It's like, I continue to watch the movie because you feel sympathy for Mira's and Val's characters but you constantly wonder why you're feeling sympathy because there is no depth to their characters, they're paper cut and far too Hollywoodish! I read one review that was commenting on Val's weird grin that he displayed through the whole movie, I concur, and it was very annoying! I thought to myself: just because this guy is blind why then, therefore, does he have to have a speech impediment? Is that really necessary? Was his weird speaking pattern and bizzare smirk really necessary? Indeed, both of these actors have played in much better movies than this! Yikes, stay away, this movie gives me a nauseating feeling!"
3,"Decent enough romance, but drags on","Love at first sight is a feel good romance that makes you wonder what sparks true love .But on the whole, I thought it dragged on just a little too long, cutting it down to about an hour and half would have been just as emotional and dramatic as the two and half hour version.Not bad if your looking for a decent chick flick with some intelligence. Otherwise....."
1,Terrible acting,"I saw this DVD with the hopes of it being an excellent drama film that would capture me, and help me relate to the characters. It didn't.This movie almost seemed like an episode of ""Friends"" if Ross was blind.. The acting isn't believable. When Val Kilmer is mad about getting surgery on his eyes, it seems as though he's just talking - no emotion involved.I suppose I can understand how the easily entertained can like this movie, but if you truly want an excellent drama film about someone overcoming a handicap, buy Forrest Gump."
1,Buyer beware!!,I bought this tv from a box store 2 years ago and have had nothing but problems! Within the first month the tube started going out. It was replaced twice and the entire system has been replaced once by Samsung. Also the remote went out and needed to be replaced. All in all the last samsung product i will purchase.
3,It helps to have the summary from the back cover :),"Sure as she was a lightning pilot on the mighty Mississippi, Serena Caswell knew she could trust Nathan Trent as far as she could throw him. No matter that he was handsome as sin. She'd never surrender her heart-or her beloved steamboat- into the artful hands of a gamblin' man!Taking a chance was second nature to Nathan Trent, riverboat gambler and adventurer extraordinaire, but betting on his ability to survive in close quarters with flame haired river sprite 'Rena Caswell might prove the biggest gamble of his life...."
5,Great deal!,"These slides were exactly what I wanted, and much cheaper than the ones at my school's bookstore. They also shipped very quickly."
4,The Keepers of the House by Shirley Ann Grau,I get these books for my mom. She is in a book club. I go by what she says and she liked it.
3,Intense but Boring,"I can't deny this is an effective, intense work-out. I could hardly lift my arms by the time I was done. However, I was very bored during the work-out...88 lunges and 106 bicep curls will give you a work-out but will also make you watch the clock wishing it was over. Jari only varies each motion by changing the tempo. Otherwise, you're doing the same motion over and over and over. So if you're looking for an intense workout and will do anything to get it, this video is for you. But if you like variety, try a different video. I like Shape Bikini Boot Camp."
2,"Ripped arms maybe, but forget about the abs!","How can you call it ripped and chiseled, and leave out the abs?! This workout was not what I expected. I thought because of all the positive reviews that I would have a complete workout for strength training! Not so. This workout is heavy on the upper body and arms, and gives only a mild workout for the legs. Even Jari's grammar leaves something to be desired. Although who cares if it is a good workout right?! But, I found it just one more thing to be frustrated about. Another wasted DVD."
4,Poor Man's Soul Asylum,"I think I bought this album for about a buck and a half and for a very long time I never listened to it. I remember the day I realized that it was truly great. I must have had it in a shuffle and I was listening to the song 'Incestuous' while a very traumatic family crisis was going on. The pain that was heard in the vocalists voice just connected with me. I began to listen to the album quite a bit and it became a regular in my rotation. Well that was about twelve or so years ago, but every so often I like to break it out and it still makes me smile to listen. . ."
1,BAD!,"I wanted to save money and the reviews were so positive, I sprang for this -- and managed to live with the burden of using these awkward, dull things for a long time before I decided that life was too short and went back to paying for Friskars."
2,"Heavy Metal may not be dead, but it could be dying.","The lead vocals are the weakest link in this band; the drums are good, but sometimes a little overdone. The bass lines are very ordinary. The lyrics are vague, or unclear, which usually doesn't matter - if your music has a hook. The best heavy metal bands in history all had this one thing in common - from Korn to Black Sabbath, no matter how ""hard"" the music is, it has a hook. Broken Thoughts does have its moments, where they slow down to an easier, more melodic groove. Word to the band: you need a stronger vocalist to carry your music (no offense), and concentrate on what you're good at. Originality doesn't mean a thing if a song doesn't stick in your audience's head. Good luck."
5,dream a bear's nostrils and wake up at home,to find our way back from complete devastation will require that we listen to those who have known the way home a long time - gary snyder introduces us to that knowledge in these essays - this book will be read as long as there are people who read books as we know them - may that be a very long time.
2,Good Coffee table book,Its a good book if you want to leave it on your coffee table for friends to look it . Talks a lot about business aspects of Photography but lacks on tech tips and how tos . I will keep it cause it looks good but I did not learn anything from it . I would say skip it for a much better book in the PRO LIGHTING series .
5,Even works on zombies!,"Okay well maybe not, but you never know. My primary reason for buying this brand is that it is ""EPA tested"" which means it can be shipped to California. This doesn't mean it is any less powerful than regular pepper spray or bear spray (my research is that most of this stuff is more or less the same, some people with swear by pepper spray vs mace but when it comes down to it, it still burns!). This hasn't been tested on a bear or any other creatures yet, but the container itself is large but compact enough to easily carry. The safety switch comes out easily and shouldn't be a problem to use, even under pressure. Pair this with the mace brand bear spray holder/belt clip and you will be perfectly set and hopefully protected!"
2,I've had better,"Like the previous reviewer, I keep reading Robards because when she's on, it's fantastic. <u>Nobody's Angel</u> is my favorite. In this book, well, it just isn't believable. I hardly think a mobster would marry a girl just to get her into bed. Silly. THe cross dressing bit gets old too. Unless this girl is dumber than most, she would have guessed that he was under cover rather than gay a lot sooner. There is one little thing that has been nagging me both in this book and in <u>Paradise County</u>. She keeps switching styles. It can be and is hot to use more modern language in modern stories. But she can't make up her mind, and keeps slipping into regency verbiage. No modern man suckles a woman's breast ""like a babe"" there are other examples as well. This would be strike two, as far as I'm concerned. Hope the next Robards is a home run, or she may just strike out."
2,"Boring Text About ""Aesthetics""","It should be noted that I had to purchase this book (along with one other) for a class I took a few years ago that was the ICAP (Keystone) equivalent for my degree (respectively, illustration). Thankfully, instead of purchasing this from the bookstore on campus (at an outrageous price), I was able to find a copy via Amazon that was much less expensive.Yes, I was required by the guidelines of the class to read this and while it was more interesting than the other text, it was still a far cry from being entertaining or 'good'. Again, I realize that this is a textbook of sorts that many art classes utilize, but that is no excuse for it to be written in such a boring format and make art and the world of aesthetics seem 'boring' to most.I personally would say not to buy this unless you are really dedicated to wanting to learn about aesthetics or because you have to."
3,The Must Say A Well Made Movie But.....,This movie just like a lot of other movies surely had its moments. The one thing I liked about this movie was the BRILLIANT acting by Catherin Zeta Jones and Sean Connery. I think that these two go good together. I also have to tell you that it was a good story line only it had the wrong writers.
2,Just Silly,"I'm sure men will enjoy this movie more than women, if for no other reason than they get to see Catherine Zeta Jones doing some intricate acrobats, meant to display her perfect body. But other than the fact that Jones and Connery are two very attractive people, who have great chemistry together (despite the age difference), Entrapment has very little to offer. It's a caper that ridiculously turns into a bad romantic comedy, and in the end it is as unsatisfactory as it is silly."
4,Zeta Jones in Entrapment on D-VHS: the only way to go,"The D-VHS version of this film is lusciously filled with the subtleties of light that will test the best of big screens--and this D-VHS version of Entrapment is a near perfect print. With HDTV quality images, the viewer can experience just what the lighting director had in mind--how shall I light Zeta Jones this evening on the board walk? Scotland to Asia (was it Singapore or Hong Kong), are ""spot on."" Beautifully shot film on our newest most detailed medium--D-VHS. Clearly, undoubtedly better than DVD quality images. Big screen owners will love it's detail, but a word of warning: you need to have a D-VHS machine that plays ""D-Theatre."" Unfortunately, there's still some disagreement amongst the movie houses regarding d vhs formats, thus, not all d vhs machines are ""d theatre"" certified. Can't wait for more films to be released of this quality on d vhs--it's truly like getting a director's print for your own home big screen."
3,GREAT ACTION. However....,"Entrapment is one of the greatest action movies I have seen in a long while. It's really too bad that that's really all that it is. The countless suspenseful scenes, and pulse-quickening action is so plentiful, that this movie has very little actual plot. The plot that is there is shaky, and difficult to comprehend. Personally, it sounds like any other ""world domination"" story that is so oft repeated in Hollywood, but maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, the romantic subplot is far from romantic, and is very disjointed from the rest of the story. With the plot depth of an episode of The Flintstones, and the romance of an infomercial, this film is not really worth seeing unless you're craving a lot of action. (I must admit I WAS on the edge of my seat a few times.)"
3,A good B movie!,"It is never quite clear who is entrapping and/or conning and/or double-crossing whom. The general impression of the plot is fuzzy - it should have been cleared up. Miss Zeta Jones is very beautiful and attractive young lady who it is pleasure to watch. In Zorro she was a convincing fencer, in Entrapment she is not convincing as a contortionist or an acrobat. Sean Connery is old, OLD! I do not write this from youthful hubris, I'm over seventy myself."
3,Mild Diversion,"Connery co-produced this late career art thief potboiler. Zeta-Jones is lovely to look at and she uses her dancing skills well, but the plot is predictable, including the twists at the end."
5,"After The Matrix, The Best Film Of 1999!","This is a great film! Sean Connery turns in some of his best work here as a crook named Mac who attempts to pull off one last, multi billion dollar heist! The Extremely Beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones plays a respected agent who teams up with Mac in order to try to catch him. Don't miss the last 30 minutes of sheer action as they attempt to rob one of the biggest banks, not to mention the biggest building, in the world! Then again, Don't miss any of it.Don't get trapped into not seeing Entrapment!"
5,Dr Blockbuster's view on Entrapment,"Well .. .what a great film!Dr Blockbuster was lucky. Sir Sean brought the UK premiere of this film to The Odeon in Edinburgh in 1999 and he was accompanied by Catherine Zeta Jones. The Odeon in Edinburgh shares the same date of birth as ""Lord Connery"" and you can read more about the campaign for the Sir Sean Connery Film Centre, and why not lend YOUR support, [...]A great post-Bond movie for Sean Connery!"
2,Watch It Only For Connery,"Entrapment is too mediocre to be enjoyed. Connery is it's only saving grace. The plot is weak, the action is subdued, and Zeta Jones has no acting ability. Ving Rhames makes a few scenes good, but Will Patton is miscast. This film has nothing that makes other caper films good. No suspense, no style, and no plot seriously hurt this film. If you want a better heist film, watch The Hot Rock."
4,Light Romance with a little Mystery,"This is guilty pleasure reading for me. My two favorite genres are romance and mystery, so it's great to find them together.This is not great literature, but it's good escapism. I was sure of a happy ending, there's some sexual tension but no graphic sex, and the mystery kept my interest.I'll be looking for more Barbara Freethy novels when I need to escape for a while."
2,What was I thinking??,"I picked this up because it was suggested to me from Amazon. I do not know why. This is not at all my type of book. I like a romance the caliber of Nicholas Sparks ok, but this was just way too ""simple"". Some of the actions by the characters were, well, very out of character. Shallow characters and an expected plot. I have forced myself to finish it, but will think twice before ordering a book, simply because ""others have read""..."
2,sad i wasted $4.99 on this,"I've been buying books for no more then 99 cents, and found the reviews to this pretty good and decided to venture out and spend a whoping $5 on this. Too bad I did, because now Im making myself read this just bc I spent more then I wanted to. I keep watching the percentage go up bc Im looking forward to the end."
4,Summer Secrets,I really enjoyed this book. It made me both smile and cry and kept my attention. I am looking forward to reading more of her books!
3,A Familiar Coastline,"""Summer Secrets"" doesn't break any new ground, but it does shove a lot of that ground into its pages. The dominating element is the standard stranger/secret investigator romance plot, but the chemistry between the two main characters is a little flat and a little forced. There is also a separate romance sub-plot of lost love, which probably deserved a little more time, along with the standard dysfunctional family story that sees to be obligatory if you're writing about a group of sisters and their dad. The best of the plotlines, however, is the mystery of what really happened eight years before the current story time. While it could have been a little more explosive -- Freethy shows her cards on one element midway through the book -- it keeps you reading through the more predictable fare."
3,My first experience with this author,I read this book based upon reviews and have to say I was disappointed. I thought the plot was very predictable with little to no intrigue. By the end I didn't like the sisters at all for the way they protected their father who didn't know how to be a father to them. Will be hard pressed to read any of her other books.
3,Not as amazing as I expected,"I was expecting to be fully engrossed and in love with this story from all of the raving reviews. However, it just didn't blow me away. I liked it, didn't love, and it took me longer than I planned to finish. A fine summer read, I am no better or worse for having read it."
3,Shut Up Gloria,"On-court scenes are entertaining, even though the Director used an excessive amount of slow-motion. Snipes and Harrelson are entertaining and believable as basketball hustlers. However, Rosie Perez pretty much killed this movie for me. I can't stand her - the way she lounges around the apartment doing nothing expecting her boyfried to support her stupid ""destiny"" to be on a game show, the alcoholism, the three-foot thick fake Brooklyn meets Puero Rican accent, or how she always seems to get her way by taking a seat on her boyfriend's lap. The scene where whe asks Snipes' wife for a refund is a joke. Just shoot hopes and talk trash, fellas - leave all of the ""Movin' On Up"" stuff for the Jeffersons."
1,cartoons and etc....,This book is a bunch of cartoons with no answers to the questions. To understand the book you have to have a sense of imagination. The author gets too personal with his pictures instead of teaching about phyical science.
3,"Glad it's on blu-Ray, but quality isn't great.","After YEARS of waiting for this to be released in anamorphc widescreen, it finally arrives on Blu-Ray. Quick review: The picture quality was disappointing to say the least. Not necessarily the Bluray transfer, but there is an INSANE amount of film grain in several of the scenes. Very annoying if you care at all about picture quality. My step-children who are 12, 11, and 8 asked me if something was wrong with the disc, that's how bad it was. Buy at your own risk. It was good just to watch the movie again after not seeing it for several years."
4,"Hilarious, but repetitive","Home Alone 2 has almost the exact storyline plot of the first movie. The differences are that he is left behind at a different location and goes even further from his family. Other then that, the plot is the same (even the fear of having to sleep with cola-guzzling, bed-wetting Fuller!), but at least Kevin knows what do do in certain situations. Nevertheless, the film keeps you laughing, especially Criminal War II! By the way, the injuries suffered by Harry and Marv this time around would no doubt be fatal."
4,OKay Movie,I bought this movie as one of many movies for my Dad's birthday.And he loves the movie.My dad loves all the home Alone mvoes with Kevin. (Not the others that followed after 2)It has a few laugh Out loud scenes.Many people will consider this a re-hashing of the first movie but it's trying to use the formula that made the first movie so popular.My dad and I love it but if you dislike sequels that has the basic same plot as the first movie then you might not like it.
3,"Post 9/11, this movie is haunting","I would agree with most of the reviews already posted. However, one must realize this movie was released in 1999. It is very haunting because the World Trade Center encompasses an entire scene, where Macauley Culkin's character goes up to the viewing platform and looks down on the city. Very, very sad. Makes 9/11 seem so surreal.Also, for young children, this movie can be scary for another reason: they are afraid that they too might be abandonded by their parents. Our youngest son was about five at the time and we had to reassure him that he would never, ever be forgotten or abandoned.For older kids, they see the slapstick comedy of the bad guys and don't realize that this brand of humor can hurt. Our older boy who was about eight at the time went through a few days of pummeling his little brother in one way or another.Other than these issues, it was a typical kid movie that was fun and predictable."
2,"Pretty Good, But Could Have Been Better","This was pretty good for elementary school kids, but didn't have much for the adults. It was a bit dumbed-down with a formula too easy to read. Did they use some of the same props for this this movie from the first movie? I thought I detected that. I found this review had some good points....""They tried the same formula but it did not have the charm, warmth, or laughs of the first film. This time they even threw in a homeless woman to try and capitalize on America's fascination and empathy for homeless people. It didn't work. The homeless woman character seemed to be full of all sorts of wisdom and brilliance. She was also some kind of ""bird lady"" who fed pigeons in the park and was almost entirely covered by bird feces. Too bad she didn't use her profound sense of wisdom to understand that being covered in bird poop is unhealthy and disgusting.""Caulkin is beguiling and quite a pest...but he is not as good the second time."
2,"If you think seeing people get hurt is funny, this movie's for you","Pure uninspired slapstick. The ""bad guys"" get hurt over and over again. If you want to teach your kid to have no compassion for other people, this movie will help you do it."
2,Not like the first one...,"I really enjoyed Home Alone 1. It was very creative and a fun, family holiday movie, with a lot of laughs. The second one had such potential, but they ruined it in so many ways. First of all, he isn't Home Alone, so the title alone is ridiculously incorrect. He is accidently in NY while his family is searching for him. Everything is so repetitive-from eating ice cream while watching movies, to the pranks he plays on the villains. What I noticed most was the furniture in his hotel room. It is from the house set of the first movie! Look at the 4 poster bed, the tv, the tables, even the lamp and the decorations around the fireplace. After all the money they made on the first movie, they couldn't even purchase new props? Stick with the first movie-this one is just a remake with a lot of bad choices. No charm, whatsover. I gave it 2 stars for keeping the same cast and the lovely scene of the toy store. But those 2 things are not worth the movie, itself."
4,Funny flick,"My six year old loves this movie and watches it over and over. He memorizes quotes from the movie and blurts them out at the funniest moments. A good family movie, though I did have to mention to my son that he is not to speak to us the way ""Kevin"" speaks to his parents!"
5,"Excellent cross between power pop, graage, and Miami Gun Club","Ward Dotson and thew rest of the Pontiac Brothers are under appreciated in this criminally neglected album. The song ""Be Married Song"" is a brilliant creation of nested hooks, Paul Westerberg vocals, and ironic lyrics straight from a country-western song. ""Brown Eyed Woman"" is a torch song written from the guys perspective and Robert Hunter's lyrics finaly make sense in this context and with this line-up, because the Dead's version was never right.Get.This.Album."
5,Fun,This book was a lot of fun to read. You can tell a lot of thought went into the characters and the plot. It was hard to put down; the type of book one thinks about reading on the drive home from work.We got a lot of use out of this book as my 10 year old son and wife also completely enjoyed it.
3,I am going to read the rest in the series.,"I don't think this is the greatest book I have ever read by James Patterson. It wasn't all bad. It was a little hard for me to get into it, it's just not my type of story. But I did read it and now I want to know what happens so I'm going to be reading the rest in the series."
3,Addicting Reads!,"Great Series for 6 graders to get them reading. Misfit experimental children ban together to survive against the scientists that want them back. Strong, imperfect female lead."
5,Excellent book,"I'm usually not a person who reads for fun but this book had me glued to the couch reading it. It combines humor, action, and suspense. This combination along with it being an easy read makes this book a winner. I recommend this book for anyone. Patterson is a wonderful writer and his genius shows in his work. He's got a way with words that makes the characters that more fun to learn about and the whole book that much more fun to read. Two thumbs way up!"
2,Not a complete story - INCREDIBLY annoying lack of ending,"OK. I actually FOUND a copy of this book in a vacation house. I started reading and got into the story. And then the freaking book just ENDS without resolving anything. Whoever thought this was a good idea is a PUTZ. Yes, I know there are sequels, but I feel misled and SUPER ANNOYED!"
4,good read,"Bought the book for my daughter (required reading). Read through the book so as to see what the storyline entailed. It is a good read, interesting story and moved along at a good pace."
3,Angel Experiment,I liked Max and her story. Her story is engaging and Patterson does a great job of making the science sound realistic. I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's definitely for young readers but it was ok for a one time read.
5,Awesome Series,"This is an awesome series. I found myself falling in love with the characters from the very first chapter. I have devoured these books in no time flat. I'm a little disappointed that I will be starting the last book in the series soon because the characters are so wonderful that I hate to lose them. I honestly feel like I know them. Patterson did an awesome job. In my opinion, this set is one of his better works."
3,Missing an ending...,"Endings are important. Endings have meaning. Meaning is why we read books rather than watch shiny videos all day on tv, right? If Patterson wants to write a sequel, that's fine, but he owes his young readers a sense of closure, at the least, and the beauty of transformation, at the best.Of course, everyone loves pretty girls with wings, so I give the book 3 stars. But this is not really a novel in any traditional sense. It's a series of episodes."
3,It was FREE on Kindle!,"This is by far the best of the five or six free Kindle books that I've read. Yes, it's kind of silly and hokey in parts, and the sudden reappearance of the bad-guy Erasers from nowhere got tiresome, but all in all, it was an entertaining, quick read. It wasn't engaging enough to make me want to rush out and buy the other books in the series, but it did supply a few hours of diversion."
2,Lots of unanswered questions!,I bought this thinking it was #3 in the Lake House series. WRONG!! I had no idea it was geared toward pre-teens. No wonder it was so basic. Aside from that I want to know WHY Jeb left and what is the flock going to do now? I feel a bit cheated...I waded thru this book to be left with tons of questions. I am passing it my 13 year old to see what he thinks of it.
3,Patterson's Attempt at Being J. K. Rowling,"It makes sense to put the bird series into a children's format. I just wish he had done it instead of writing ""When the Wind Blows"" and the ""Lake House."" This was a great idea, but as a previous reviewer stated the book is open ended. I love the characters and the premise, but there is a lot of missing information. You are left in the dark. Even in a series, each book should stand on its own."
4,Maximum Ride,"MAXIMUM RIDEWOLF MANIn the book Maximum Ride is told in Max's point of view. Maximum Ride, 14 year old girl leader of a band kids who have escaped the lab where they were bred as 98% human and 2% and developed a variety of other worldly talents. Some of the main characters are iggy, nudge, fang and gassy. In Patterson's unusual universe, Max and her young partners have the ability to fly, but are soon forced to rescue one of her own -a girl named angle - from a pack of mutant wolf humans called erasers. The erasers are armed with bare claws and assault rifles. I could not put this book down .you never know what's going to happen next. I loved this bookThis is a must read book It's full with action and adventure. I think the theme could be adventure because max and her partners are on a big adventure also think the genre of this book is action . I recommend this book to 12 year old's and up. I'd give this book 5 stars."
4,Fast delivery and great condition,I was pleased when I received this book in just a few days and it was in great condition
3,The Angel Experiment Maximum Ride book 1,I would recommend this book to tweens and teens. It kept me interested and wanting more. Oh the possibilities that are in the world today...and tomorrow.
3,there is no ending to this book,"this was a good book, but when i got to the end there really wasnt anything like a climax. it was the same feeling throughout the whole book and then it just ended. not even a good ending.nothing happened"
4,Fantastic,This book was amazing it ran on a little bit at times. I thought it could have been a little bit shorter but even when it ran it was great. I know that you can't trust things on the internet but this is my honest opinion. IT WAS GREAT!!! This book is one of the biggest page turner' s I know in fact I read this in one day. This book is very descriptive in fight scenes and adds an element that helps how intense it Is and once again you can never put it down. You really see the book in your mind. And the words the author uses makes the book very emotional. With twists and turns James Paterson has really out done himself. I recommend this book to all Percy Jackson fans.
2,"Strictly for Pre-Teens, not a good ""cross-over"" novel","Some young adult novels are good ""cross-over"" novels and have the ability to entertain and engross all ages (i.e. Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, Earthsea, etc.). This, unfortunately, isn't one of those novels. I can't even say that the writing would be a good ""teen read."" In fact, I would place it in the ""pre-teen"" caetegory.The writing, per se, is not bad, but for an adult reader, not terribly engrossing. I liked the concept, but did not find it to be much of a page turner, perhaps because the characters were not depicted in depth enough early on to draw me in. A mediocre read."
4,Good--continuity problems keep it from being great,"This is a very good read, and Mr. Patterson definitely keeps the reader engaged in the story from the first page. You quickly come to care about the human/avian children, and their fates. My only quibble with the book (keeping it from a five-star rating) is the lack of continuity between it and 'Lake House'. Going under the assumption that 'Max' here is the same young lady as in the previous two bird books, there is no explanation of what went on during the intervening four or so years, nor what happened to some major characters. On top of that, some of her backstory has changed. Please don't get me wrong--it's a good book and I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel. However, a cleaner tie-in to the previous works would have made it even better."
3,A good read but not amazing.,This book was recommended to me by a family member. I found it fairly interesting with cool concepts. However it tends to repeat the same the over and over again. It did leave me wanting to read the next in the series. I was disappointed in how the books turned out as a series. Not my Dave writing style.
3,okay book,Weak characterization - lots of repetition and stock characters. Uninspired dialogue.Has a strong plot line with good action - got that part right.Didn't think it was a good enough book to add to my classroom library - will just give it away.
4,i thought it was good. i liked the action.,"I thought the book was good. I liked the short chapter because it made me want to read more. I enjoyed reading the book. I will read the next two books when I can get my hands on them. I liked Angel a lot. I thought she was so cute. I guess the book really tapped into my maternal instincts because it made me love her and want to take care of her.I liked Max. I thought she was a strong leader and I liked that she narrated the book through her thoughts. This book has a lot of action in it, which makes it exciting to keep reading. I hope you go out and read it.thank you for your time,Loran"
3,Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment,Easy reading. Corny plot but overall enjoyable as long as one accepts it for the fiction it is. Left me looking forward to another along the same lines.
3,easy read with a message,"This seris is good. The first book tells an excellant story in the style for which James Patteson is so famous. The characters capture your imagination and make you want to know them better. My only objection to the books is the underlying message: Humans have so messed up our world that they must be eliminated and let the smart folks start over to make a perfect world. Be warned, these books are a teaching tool for the global warming hoax."
1,Max (Dark Angel ripoff),"This is a poorly done ripoff of the TV series, Dark Angel. Fortunately I didn't spend any money on this book. Someone gave it to me. The book is not complete by itself and is obviously an attempt to start a series."
2,Terrible Book,"What started off as a clear, concise text that fully explained basic concepts quickly degraded into a confusing and unhelpful text that seemed to assume you already knew the topics and treated it as a review. Example problems are completely worthless as Rao often skips dozens of steps at once, assuming the reader is already a pro at modeling complex physical systems. To make matters worse, there seems to be a distinct lack of explanations and plain definitions for many terms that are randomly introduced into the topic. Modal shapes, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, etc. are all introduced with little to no background information.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I could potentially see the book's value as a review text or reference, but as the main text for an introductory course on vibrations... Well, let's just say you better have a much better teacher than Rao is a writer."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE,This movie is so awful that it deserves to be on Mystery Science Theater 3000.The special effects were very cheap and storyline was stupid.Try watching the first film(which is wonderful)and pretend this sequel doesn t exist.
2,"A bit scary for younger kids, beware if you are used to modern Samurai-era Power Rangers","My exposure to Power Rangers stuff has been the typically corny battle scenes and dialogue, but otherwise harmless characters. And in the case of Power Rangers Samurai, the characters are actually pretty thoughtful and try to teach a lesson. So when I saw the positive reviews for this movie, I thought it was a slam-dunk. But about a quarter through, my 5 year old was scared and wanted to turn it off. We persevered a bit, but some of the bad guys in this are really gross and creepy. Probably fine for older kids, but just be aware that this is a different vibe from the modern stuff."
5,Love it,"I enjoyed this movie it was amazing I love all power rangers I would recommand this dvd to any and all Power Rangers fans,"
5,Best plug for 13B-MSP/Renesis engine,"Stock Trailing Plug for Mazda RX-8 Rotary Engine ONLY.If you want to try them on say, 13B-REW, you better make sure you know what you're doing.Make sure you Rev your engine every week or so, or else the plugs might foul quickly.Change them out no later than 25K miles. Dont believe me? You can try to go longer and see.Oh by the way, this is probably the BEST plug for Renesis/13B-MSP engine. Unless you're going FI, nothing works better than this plug for this engine."
2,A missed opportunity,"What strikes me about this recording is that two different interpretations are going on at the same time. Maestro Sawallisch gives an intimate parlor reading of the cycle (much in keeping with Schubert's own milieu) while Thomas Hampson leads a full-blown operatic assault. This is disappointing because I prefer Hampson's work when he sings on a smaller scale. Just listen to his Scene from Faust in the Hyperion Schubert Edition, where he practically whispers into Marie McLauglin's ear. It is some of the most compelling drama I have ever heard.I much prefer the recording of Winterreise by Thomas Allen and Roger Vignoles, where there is a strong sense that the performers are on the same page."
5,A perfect winter journey,"I love this interpretation of Winterreise. Thomas Hampson's singing is so profound, so heartfelt here. He brings out the pain, the loss, he brings colour into the music. I don't claim to have heard hundreds of versions of this cycle, but I had heard more than one when I bought this CD, and for me it is the best of all. I highly recommend it!"
2,Long time fan finds only disappointment,"This geezer, who owns vinyl going back to My Generation, was disappointed. You can read all the glowing reviews here (I sure did) and be swayed. Or you can save your dough and go back to the Live at Leeds 14 track version, which includes many of the same songs, just in a more stirring performance. And, as a bonus, you get to skip the perfunctory Tommy stuff completely. It just ain't worth it. From the sadly missing horns in the overture to the strained vocals throughout, this Tommy is a hobbled version of the original.I read here The Who was the finest live act ever. Maybe they were, though I sure did not see every big band in those days. I saw many, including the Moon-drumming Who twice, and was richly rewarded both times. Those were fun nights, with an energy and vibrancy I enjoyed. This CD just does not measure up.No need for more comment. I didn't much like it. Leeds is still a winner, this, a remote runner-up."
3,Nowhere near as good as LEEDS,"Sorry fellow Who fans, but giving this five stars is nuts. The Who had plenty of off nights, and this was surely one of them. A few key selections from TOMMY are excluded, and the band sounds tired of playing it already. As for the other songs, the ones that are also on LIVE AT LEEDS are MUCH stronger on that set, and WATER, I DON'T EVEN KNOW MYSELF, and NAKED EYE are alot better on the remastered WHO'S NEXT."
4,Wonderful world influences!,"Destiny marks the return to English music for Gloria Estefan, but the African, Carribbean, and Latin influences of her last few years can easily be heard here. From the very African You'll Be Mine (Party Time) to the beautifully rich Spanish guitar on Steal Your Heart, the world rhythms permeate this album. Reach, which is probably most familiar from radio play, is unsurprisingly the most mainstream song here. While I don't care for a couple of the songs, many of the others spontaneously pop into my head frequently. Highly recommended."
4,Pure glory from Gloria Estefan,"Quality in every department on this album. As an artist she always gives the best to the listner. You know what you get, but it`s nothing wrong with that. From the opening track Destiny to Track 11 Reach there is just small musical letdowns to not give the CD a five star. But the glorious ""Estefan touch"" shines trough the weaker things anyway. Personally I prefer here when she sings in spanish, because it`s more real in a way. You get anyway a good mix of slow songsand songs with more ""up tempo"" beat. Track 5 You`ll be mine is a good example of that. Track 9 Along came you is an another example wich realy make you ""cha cha cha"" all trough. The acoustic Track 11 Reach is a classical Estefansongs as we like it. A fine end to a good musical journey."
5,Great Chair Cover,I really like these chair covers. I bought two of them through Amazon. They cover the chairs completely and protect them for rain and sunshine.
3,DeVito (Mis)Direction Sends Potential Classic Off-Track,"Yes, Nicholson gives another good (I would hesitate to say great) performance, but DeVito miscasts himself and shows a complete lack of knowledge when it comes to the direction of action sequences. I didn't believe any of the big set piece action sequences for a minute. Much of the early movie is dark and gloomy, and that's exactly the mood established in me. Hoffa was a gangster, pure and simple, and not a subject for glorification, but if you're gonna do it, at least have the style and wit of a Scorsese or Coppola. Not recommended."
5,Hoffa: One of my heroes! Great Film!,This movie rocks! Hoffa and the movie Casino with Robert De Niro are the two greatest movies of all time! Hoffa tells the story of a labor matyr with such precision that it could make a heartless man cry! I have always been a fan of drama movies and this one really kicks @$$! This movie is tied with Casino for my favorite movies of all time! See it now!

5,Excellent fast guitar rock!,"I downloaded the MP3 sample track from Amazon and liked it enough to immediately buy the album. It's even better than I had hoped, melding a variety of styles from near-punk to near-country with sharp lyrics and punchy playing. Barbara Keith's voice is stunning. Definitely a keeper."
1,"The Shame of Amazon.com - Horrific, Loathsome Music","WARNING WARNING WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM - Imagine, if you can, Sheryl Crow recovering from a headcold and a 3 day cocaine, booze, laxative and Draino binge yodelling some seriously hideous, contrived country lyrics so shallow and insincere that even Garth Brooks would puke uncontrollably. Still with me? Cause they don't stop there, noooo. This album is like a black hole. I'm sure that if it were played over a loudspeaker it would quickly end even the worst European soccer riot. Thoroughly wretched playing by all the band members (thank god there are only 3 of them)cannot hope to elevate this utter affront to the human race. Once again shame on Amazon.com. You know better but chose to bring this to your customers anyway."
2,I'm the odd man out,"I'm an avid home work out-er. I heard about Jari and figured I should give her a try since everyone is raving about her. I found this work out BORING. Don't get me wrong, it's hard, but the amount of the same set over and over I found very dull. I didn't think it was as hard as it was made out to be either. The main point is if it's a hard work out, I like to be distracted, and feel like the time flies so I'm not focusing on how terrible I feel. I felt like this work out dragged on and on. I did it twice, and decided that was enough for me. I also found all their bodies disgusting. Over tanned, zero body fat, nastiness. Her body doesn't motivate me at all. Also, what's with her asking ""Are you smiling?"" It made me want to punch her in the face! I was so annoyed at her saying that. She said it like three times, and always at moments when I really wouldn't be smiling. All in all, I like Tracie Long better."
1,"Not well done, not worth it","I was very excited to get this dvd, I had heard great things and who is going to argue with burning 1000 calories in a hour? I was really upset when I started my first workout and you couldn't see the trainer's whole body. They would start sets of her working out showing her from the waist up, I had no idea what she was doing with her feet! I think it would have been a great workout, but they did a bad job filming it."
2,Was this a bootleg version?,"The quality of the video was not very good. The music was awful too. The concept is good, but I would not recommend this DVD."
5,My unique experience,"I love all the Jari Love DVD's. Back when I started doing them, I had a question about something, and e-mailed Jari through her website. She did not e-mail me back, SHE CALLED ME!!!! When has that ever happened before! She has a customer for life, so it is a good thing her products are awesome. My only problem after getting Ripped 1000 is that I don't want to do any of my other workouts including the other Ripped series. That is because when I complete the 1000 I know I have gotten the most thorough workout I could possibly get.I would suggest, if you are a beginner, either start with another Ripped DVD and work up through that or be prepared to do the cardio modifications and use lighter weights than you usually would. Jari promises the ""best shape ever"", and if you build up to doing Ripped 1000 started to finish 3 times a week, you will be! I feel like at 43 I am in better shape than ever, and my 15 year old daughter just commented on how ""buff"" my arms are!"
4,very intense,"I've been working out for the past 14yrs, off and on, 3-6 days a week. This is probably the most challenging video I have ever done. I like it b/c its so intense. jari isnt annoying however she is very very dry. all she can say is ""up up, down down, up up, down down..."" and ""great on you"". She is not overly inspiring so you really need to be in themood to committ to the workout. Its an hour long, but the intervals make it go by a little faster. When I'm feeling sluggish I just take breaks b/w intervals.Its a lot of squats and lounges and combo moves. Very good work out. I hi-ly recomend it."
2,the Circle Jerks suck 16 minutes of crap,dont buy this it sucks. Beverly hills is a good song the rest of them are crap. Buy mainliner by social distortion
2,A little irritating,I liked the convienece of these pads with the lanolin built in but the pads irritated my skin a little. The edges of the pads were not soft. I wouldn't purchase these again. I'm going back to the Johnson and Johnson pads.
2,Good Concept But Okay Product,"The concept of the pads are great. However, product execution was not done very well. While it varies from pad to pad, the amount of lanolin seemed decent. Even the main material of the pad, the portion that contains the lanolin, feels comfortable. The problem for me was that the size of the pads and/or the material around the outer edges. The material around the edges of the pads was very uncomfortable in that it's too scratchy. It feels like paper and would have been better if it was the same as the material of the pad. The size of the pads also seem small (I'm ~42DD) because of the scratchiness. Perhaps if the pads were larger it wouldn't be as much of a problem of it a different material was used all together. I stopped using them and instead use another disposable brand all together & just add lanolin myself as needed."
5,WONDERFUL,"I believe that after you have watched this,you will have a great idea who is Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). We are ignorant of him and I strongly recommand you to learn about his life because Michael H. Hart, ""The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History."" He states that the most influential person in all history was Muhammad, peace be upon him, with Jesus second. Examine his actual words:""My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level."" Michael H. Hart, THE 100: A RANKING OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PERSONS IN HISTORY, New York: Hart Publishing Company, Inc., 1978, page. 33."
2,Fair at best,"Just as I expected, I knew that there would be rabid fans labeling this affair with overwrought accolades. Ms. Thorn has produced much better work than this with EBTG and various guest appearances. But without the club beat-backed tracks too add some ""oomph"", this album would be one big snooze. And even the club tracks don't sizzle. There was nothing here that made me want to know what she was singing about. I just didn't care.Brilliant? Umm, I don't think so."
1,Doesn't even sound like...,"I listened to the CD with long awaited hopes of hearing Tracey's voice. But I have to say it sounds absolutely nothing like her! I gave it a fair chance, I listened to the CD 3 times through. I'll keep waiting for the next CD in hopes of hearing her amazing EBTG voice singing ballads."
4,Very nice electronic return,"Well, after many years waiting for new music of EVBG, the alone return of Tracy Thorn to the electronic music is a very nice sorprise. Good lyrics and a fresh and modern music are a good CD to play again and again. Enjoy it!"
5,"Delightful, touching, fun, halloweeny movie","This movie is in my top 5 all-time movies. I'm sure it wasn't a block buster. It has no stunning special fx. It has a great cast and is wonderfully acted and it hits me in my heart every time I see it. I don't watch many movies more than once, but I watch this movie regularly. It's about loss, love and sticking together when the going gets tough, along with many other things."
4,Fun! Pulled all my strings! Excellent Sunday afternoon video,"If you like to see stars doing slightly different roles than how you usually see them, then check out Devito and Sinise. If you like to see stellar performances by unknowns, check out this new kid Steinmiller as Devito's older son. This movie works for me!"
5,One of David Byrne's best works.,"I've always loved the Talking Heads and while I've been intrigued by much of David Byrne's solo work and loved individual songs off of Rei Momo and Uh-Oh, this album is his best. I love every song on it. ""Angels"" ranks among my Top 25 Songs of all time which is quite an accomplishment considering how much I love music and how varied my tastes are. If you like inventive and passionate singers like David Byrne, this album is a must-have."
3,dated,"Back in the 1980s Talking Heads were considered hippest of the hip, and David Byrne was most celebrated of musical celebrities. This ain't the 1980s.What was most hip yesterday often sounds most dated today.I have had all the Talking Heads albums. Used to like 'em a lot.I bought this album when it came out & played it a lot for about a week -- and haven't wanted to play it at all since.Now that we're (way) beyond the 1980s, David Byrne sounds just too affected, too pretentious, too self-consciously striving for hipness."
5,The Blueprint of Death Rock,"""Only Theatre of Pain"" was first released in 1982, and it really helped kick off the death rock/goth movement in America. It is truly a classic, and I highly recommend it to all fans of goth, and even open minded punk fans. This is a record that everyone should find something to like about. Well, maybe not the deeply religious. Every song is good, but my favorites are ""Romeo's Distress"" (the album is worth buyig for this track alone!), ""Spiritual Cramp"", an more punky sounding song with cool blasphemous lyrics, and ""Figurative Theatre."" I can't quite figure that one out, but it is fun to dance to. As a final note, this is the REAL Christian Death, with Rozz Williams on vocals. Take my advice, avoid any Christian Death release that features Valor as the lead singer, unless you like bad heavy metal. Rest in peace, Rozz."
4,Jen Dominique Bauby is a model for everyone to follow,"This book was inspiring and stimulating. The strength and willpower this man had is amazing and mesmerizing. He never lost faith and held on. A very moving read, I hope whoever reads this finds it as wonderful as I did. I recommend this to anyone who likes intellectual and thought- provoking books."
4,Diving Bell,This is an informative and eye opening book into the thoughts of a person with 'locked in' syndrome. It was light reading. Is a short book as one could expect considering the conditins it had to be written under.
5,It's the little things,"Short but really poignant memoir by a French journalist (Jean-Dominique Bauby) who falls into a coma and then is the victim of 'locked-in' syndrome, a condition that occurs when the brain stem becomes inactive. The only things he can move are his neck (about 90 degrees) and his left eyelid. Using his eyelid, a computer device and an assistant, he dictates this entire memoir, that talks about how he misses simple things, like being able to stroke his son's hair, or the taste of a meal that he's cooked for himself. He has to mentally go to the various places he travelled to before the syndrome, in order to keep from going crazy, a working brain locked in an inactive body. While the book is depressing, it's surprising how uplifting it is, in a way. Makes you realize how much about life you take for granted."
4,Destiny,"This man surely lived his destiny, be it a sad one. Without Jeremy Leggatt's accident and subsequent experiences we would not have the insight of living the life he did and be poorer for it. With humour and candor he takes us on his journey with all its struggles and poignant moments. Everyone needs to read this book to get an insight into how treasured life needs to be and how, until something like this happens to us, we take life for granted.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,The audio version is outstanding!,"Rene Auberjonois reads the text with impleccable pronunciation and exquisite pacing, bringing both the essays and the author alive. The tapes transformed my usually tedious commute into a too-brief visit with a remarkable man"
5,It makes me wish..,".the book makes me almost hurt to have known him. This man gives me hope as I, and we all, face the human condition. I value life much more now that I have read Bauby's book. Give it as a gift to those you know who suffer, and perhaps to those who race too fast through life."
4,Great stuff a pity the master wasn't still here...,"Normally with tribute albums you are not exactly sure what to expect but on this tribute to Suba I am very impressed. There are some reworkings of what are now classic songs from Sao Paolo Confessions as well as a few Suba tracks that would probably have been released soon after Sao Paolo confessions.Some of the tracks are posthumous collaborations and some are live collaborations between Suba and variuos artists. Some of the remakes have actually, dare I say improved on the originals and overall it is a great album to have in your collection."
4,"Overdone, but very,very, funny & entertaining.","The opening scene and climax of this film are melodramatic, but what happens in between is hilarious. The entire production design is dazzling."
2,"Good sets, dumb story","After the owner of a toy company dies his militant brother tuns it into a war-toy factory, and it's up to Robin Williams to stop him. This film deserves recognition for its set pieces, while the rest of the movie sinks under its own weight. Some hokey performances (especially from LL Cool J and that girl with the bad southern accent), banal dialogue, and annoying, not to mention noisy, gadgets make this quite an ordeal to sit through."
4,This Can Be A Real Experience For SOME People,"General Leland Zevo takes over Zevo Toys and wants to secretly make weapons disguised as toys for the good of military, but that is not what Leslie Zevo wants. He only wants to carry on with his father's business who left it to Leland instead of Leslie and the general seems like he is mentally ill after a while in being convinced that he makes weapons and not toys and Leslie soon doesn't like it anymore, so the only thing left he has to do is to have his sister, his girlfriend and the general's son Patrick join him and go against the general and try to undo everything he has done with the factory. This has to be one of my favorite films. It either people love it or hate it according to every other review on this movie."
4,Very Good CD,Bill Epps keeps getting better. I liked this CD a lot more than the other Vara-tones release.
5,great book,This book is a must read for anyone wants to understand the history of independent living and the Disability Rights Movement! Well worth the read.
4,Good Condition,The book came in good condition the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it had highlighter/pen writing inside and that was not in the description. I did buy Used. Other than that I can not complain.
2,"durable outside, cheap inside","My father-in-law has this phone. While it has physically withstood being lost and dropped, the voice quality is horrible. The moment you make or receive a call involving it, you can hear your voice echoing loudly. It is impossible to have a conversation for more than a few minutes because the echo is so distracting. It does not matter how close or far you are to the base or what channel you are on. When I stay at his house, I use the phone as little as possible, and yesterday he said he was going to throw it out."
1,Very Disappointed,"Thought this book had music and the words to many songs. NO, none, not one song in this book. Not words, not chords, not notes, nothing!!! If you want some facts about the songs (without music or words) that's all you will get. Otherwise, absolutely worthless.Regis"
1,Heartaches by the number...,I was VERY disapointed with this book. Although it is interesting and informative it IS NOT SHEET MUSIC.
5,Best Carol O'Connell book yet,I have read all her books and have enjoyed each of them. This one is the best yet. She actually makes Mallory human and the story hummed right along with each character an individual with a story of their own.Would highly recommend this book.
2,Find Me,"I recently gave this book to a good friend for Christmas. After she had finished the book I ask how she enjoyed the book Find Me? Please understand that she and I have similar taste so, that even thought I did not read the book myself I probably would have felt the same way she did. She said the author was all over the place with her story and neglected to give some important details until the very end of the story. This made it made it very difficult to follow the plot. I should have read the book myself, before giving it as a gift. A lesson learned!"
2,Slow going,"I read 200 pages of this, and nothing much happened. Maybe the story starts to go somewhere in the second half; I didn't get that far.Mallory is a psychopath who is always on the verge of shooting people for minor indiscretions or for no reason at all. At one point she beats up an FBI agent without provocation and then walks away, while neither her victim nor his colleagues make any attempt to arrest her. The author really lost me with this scene; not only was it unrealistic, but it made Mallory seem like the quintessential bad cop - a violent nutjob who should not be carrying a gun or a badge.On the plus side, the prose is crisp and clean. There is some amusing interaction between Mallory and a state trooper at one point. And the paperback is nicely packaged in a ""venti"" (tall) edition. But since I didn't like the heroine and found the plot aimless and draggy, I can't recommend Find Me."
3,Not recieved yet,"Waiting for my phones, have 2 observations: A. Amazon.com was BY FAR the least expensive, easiest to work with on the net, other's prices don't come near. B. After sweating this decision, and researching for a week, I discovered on the brother home site, that more than 2 wirless units need an extra ""black box"" to work 3 or more phones/lines at the same time. I spent the extra $130, just wish I'd known when I made the first order."
3,Neither great nor bad,"When this came out, the classical reviewers were unkind. It is little wonder that very little worthwhile new classical music is written these days when you find out how closed minded and cold this crowd is. If it wasn't composed in the 18th century, the classical music crowd doesn't want to hear it or know about it. Heck, they roasted Gershwin when he was alive and now he is part of the standard repertoire! Hooray for Paul for trying something different even if it isn't the greatest. The finale is beautiful. I think the album is worth buying just for that. The rest of it is uneven, though quite melodic in places."
4,Fun and useful,"I've had a lot of fun playing with color and these patterns, figuring out how the pattern itself could drive color changes and how few colors are needed to not abut each other (the map problem, in mazes). Good history and overview.Good how-to section, as well as an fairly deep collection of maze patterns to use as starting points for your own design / art work."
2,Trying to Impress the Reader,"This text is written for an audience with a solid grasp of economic theory and finance. The chapters build on the vocabulary of the one preceeding it but also assumes the reader is fluent in the terminology and it's use. While answers are supplied to self test problems how to arrive at those answers is not provided. The test bank exams require absolute grasp of all variations of the problems and multiple choice answers includ likely results wich are wrong, so selecting between the correct answer and other answers which would result from common error such as a mis-set financial calculator, are provided."
1,No no no,"Maybe this was a good film in 1987, but by today's standards it is god awful. The only entertainment value comes from watching Michael Douglas talk on a cell phone the size of a shoe, then later he's amazed by a handheld television set. Other than that small amount of nostalgia, this is a horribly acted, poorly written, cliche filled mess. I cannot understand the positive reviews this gets, even by late 1980s standards. If you really want to hear some terrible dialogue, just watch the part when the union boss walks into Douglas' office. I thought I was watching a cheesy John Wayne impression. Boiler Room is the one to watch, at least that has some decent acting."
1,"Boring, confusing, lacking in character depth...","I didn't like this movie. It was VERY dull and confusing, and it was nearly impossible to relate to, sympathize with or understand any of the characters. The acting was pretty good, but overall I just couldn't wait for the movie to be over!"
4,Greed is Good?,"The SEC in this 1980's film is far more effective than the SEC of 2008, but this is a film and the SEC was pretty much worthless back then too. Trust is the basis for business, not greed. When you can't trust financial statements, CEO and executives consistently lie, and you reward incompetence then the system fails.You look at a movie like WallStreet and realize not much is different from the 80's. The cycles repeat, there is no limit to human greed, it is far easier for a good person to go bad than a bad person to ever go good and it is a bit depressing.It's funny looking at Wall Street with the green text monitors, brick cell phones, 80's style excess, and everything is dated, but you also realize the movie's story and warnings are the same today in 2009."
5,The best movie ever!!!,"I had to choose five stars because there was not an higher rating!! This is definitely an Oliver Stone's masterpiece. The movie simply does a great job is setting up the different characters and in developing a breathtaking story. Michael Douglas in the role of Gordon Ghekko is simply astonishing, and it is no wonder that by interpreting this role he became a mith.I also found the special features very interesting, with some very insightful clues on how the movie was actually made and the message that it should have conveyed (i.e. Behaving like Gordon Ghekko is BAD, Buddy is a model of integrity)."
2,Great Movie - Poor Transfer to Bluray,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wall Street"" when it first came out 25-odd years ago.I was looking forward to the BD version, thinking it would look spectacular compared to the DVD copy - was I wrong! The transfer to BD looks herendous - in fact, it looks like you are watching a DVD copy of the movie, not some digital remastering at 1080p.Save your money - buy the DVD copy and enjoy."
1,Infuriated,Watching this movie made me cringe. It was the most offensive film I have ever seen in my life! I cannot believe that some people actually enjoy this movie. Poor Westly Snipes. He was only cast in it to make it seem like it wasn't a RACIST movie. And the representation of the Japanese culture was so inacurate. Most of the Asian cast coudn't even speak Japanese! Also ALL of the female characters were blatantly degrading! I wish that Hollywood will open up their minds and portray people of color and women as PEOPLE and not just sex objects and villains.
3,Be comfortable but needed inflat frequently,"Before I buy a wood bed and mattress, I got this one and used several days.It feels comfortable, soft. But the gas flees very quickly. After two to three days, we need to inflate it once.In a word, it is more suitable to be a comfortable several-day staff, rather than for long time use."
3,ingredient sources,I bought this too quickly... this xylitol is made from corn (GMO) - those who do better on a corn-free diet or who want to avoid GMOs in their food should consider another brand.
3,Folks! VHS tape purchase,"The tape was received in a timely manner, but I was very disappointed in that the tape was advertised as being from part of a private collection and not a rental tape, yet when opened it was obvious that it was a former rental tape. I paid more for this 'private collection'tape as rental tapes of the same movie were available at a lower cost. However, when we received the tape the 'BE KIND, REWIND' sticker typically found on rental tapes was secured to the tape. It played OK, but again, I was frustrated with the false advertising."
5,This is a HOOT,"It is a bit slap stick comedy but it is great in that it is somewhat self-imposed. As a child he neglects to be in contact with his parents and when he does resond to an emergency with his Mom he gets paid back, so to speak, for the years of neglect to his parents. His troubles are due to his lack of interest in them and time has marched on leaving his knowledge of thier condition a bit dusty. Never believe that people who are lost to old age are entirely lost. They are there, somewhere!"
4,Great effort by the immortal Gil Evans,"This is a great recording by Gil Evans and his orchestra. This is a fine example that even an orchestra can do fusion. Each section in the orchestra makes a valuable contribution to the recording. ""Thoroughbread"" is an excellent introduction to the mood Evans was trying to emphasize on this session. Every song afterwards is great from a swing type to fusion/funk. Its all here! The only thing missing on this recording is Miles Davis. If Miles was in on this session this would of been a 5 Star Plus recording! However, this is an excellent CD to acquire for all Gil Evans enthusiasts."
1,Ugh.,"The biggest rip off! No wonder it was on sale, but still don't spend a penny. The girl is not a teacher in anyway!"
4,Good game,"This is a fun game with a lot of funny gags - like characters slapping each other and chewbacca ripping arms off of people. If your kids want ""violent video games"" but you are hesitant to get them, this might be a good comproise. Its a shootem' up game but when they shoot a character, they break into a million lego pieces. The game is very long and some screens can take you almost an hour."
