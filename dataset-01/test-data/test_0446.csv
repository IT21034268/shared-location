2,Posture bra strap,"Works great if u don't move. Other than that rubs your armpits, slides down, crap. It is cheap though and it hurts so you remember to stand straight."
2,Painful!,"Very uncomfortable. The straps roll up and rub the armpit which is very painful. It does improve the posture, but I wish it didn't hurt so much."
5,Still the best,"Over twenty years ago, before returning to the US from two years in Norway, I bought the LP recording of this performance of the Grieg Piano Concerto. It immediately became a favorite, a summation for me of the beauty and wonder of the land and people. Since then, I have wondered if there were better recordings available. After all, this was a recording with no well known names and little hype. I can say,now,after twenty years of listening and looking, it is still the best."
3,Great in moderation...,"I was very excited to get my hands on Aqueduct's 'I Sold Gold' because the songs I had heard I absolutely loved. The first spin of the CD had me very pleased, but after successive plays I found myself quite irratable and skipping over many of the songs.While I think 'Hardcore Days, Softcore Nights', 'Heart Design' & 'Growing Up With GNR' are fantastic songs, and are my clear favourites on the album, putting them together on an album with other only mediocre tracks makes for a tiresome listen.As stand alone tracks, the songs all have something, but listening to the entire album in one sitting makes the songs sound repetitive and the lead singer's voice whiny and grating.I do suggest purchasing the album, but in doing so I also recommend sporadic listens on maybe a mixed playlist in order to fully appreciate the separate, isolated songs, because as an album, it makes for a tedious listen, and that's a shame."
2,Biology Coloring Workbook - a disappointment,"As an AP Biology student, I expected a coloring book that would have less misinformation and typos than this book did. Although coloring did help reinforce my memory of various topics, this book hardly covered any topic to the depth sufficient for a high schooler, much less for a first-year college student. Many pictures were pointless and had little to do with the concepts covered. I was especially disappointed with the basic organic chemistry in the first chapter. Griffith and Elson have a much better biology coloring book."
5,Some of the Best,"I love this DVD, I am glad it was recommended or I probably never would have seen it."
4,Step into a world,"In his impressive body of work, Baudrillard seems to take an infinite amount of paths leading to a small set of concepts, or vectors upon which he observes society. One of those essential concepts dominating Baudrillard's work is that we can no longer make representations of the world we live in, because by now representation precedes reality, and as such is no longer a representation, but a model. Hence the end of the principle of reality, and the birth of the hyperreal, reality as nothing more than the simulation of a model.With this book, Baudrillard allows those concepts to come forward, very much like nerve cells, connecting and connected to his previous works, clarifying many of his obscure observations.Each word/theme works as a model throught which the world is, for lack of better word, simulated.In many ways, those are the models upon which Baudrillard's work is generated, but I doubt it will be of much use to those who are not familiar with his work."
2,Not what I expected,Although I am a beginner I have learned very little from this course. For a total beginner I would reccomend the Canon Digital Photography Workshop interactive CD-Rom. The most comprehensive course in the market is the 15 DVD set by Vince Wallace. It is everything one will ever need to become a professional photographer (it costs $100 but it is worth it).
2,Less than what I expected,"The DVD came with a lot of hype, ""The complete SLR Digital...."". If you have no experience with a DSLR, you will come away with little more than you went in with.Very basic, lessons too short, waste your money else where."
3,Attention before Purchasing,"To call this DVD ""The Complete SLR Digital Photography Camera Course"" is a bit too strong. It refers to basic operations, far away from a sophisticated media guide, good for those who are initiating on the SLR world."
1,Lacking in quality and content,"It was with great disappointment that I read in 15 minutes a book whose title had promised so much. A small, thin book to begin with, ""Wit and Wisdom"" is heavy on white space between too few quotes. The quotes that are collected herein appear to have been collected carelessly with little concern for their merit. The truly memorable sayings contained in this book can be counted on one hand and can be had for free with a good search engine on the internet. This is one of the few books that ever saddedned this Librarian."
2,Behind the JAPANOLOGY bow,"Interesting tidbits, like any book, but I thought this book was stereotypical japanologist..., and this is the exact type of book japanophiles should steer far, far away from. I didn't find his explanations for ""kata"" a reason why japanese culture is the ""superior society"". Nor he does he explain ""kata"" in dilligent detail. This book really wasn't about japanese bows anyway. While I don't doubt De Mente has written some good books, I think this book was his attempt at flattering and complimenting japan for cash."
5,Older Model,"This is not a review for the current Wusthof 10' chef's, but for an older model. I have a wood handled 10"" chef's knife. The wood is a black wood with deep red grain, and has no cracks. The tang is of a different shape then the current model, less curved along the heal of the blade. It looks more akin to the Henckels. The metal is the same percentages as the current, so this review should still be helpful. This knife is from the 60's and is still being used. They last forever. A 10"" knife may seem big at first, but after a couple of days using it, the weight and length actually speed things up in the kitchen. I dont use my 8"" much anymore. The steel sharpens up with a bit of effort, but does not noticably dull for several weeks. i have stopped using a steele and now just use an extra fine diamond hone every once in a while."
5,really useful,"For me, the best is studying the basics with JAPANESE IN MANGALAND, practicing writing and so with some good workbook, and learning kanji with REMEMBERING THE KANJI.This book is not for learning japanese, as other have said in their reviews, but fot learning japanese kanji only, so it is normal not being able to read japanese only by studying this book. And it is true that constance is needed. But it is impossible to read japanese without knowing kanji, and it is very difficult to learn kanji with a normal textbook. I kept forgetting strokes and stroke orders, and the reason for it was that I didn't see kanji like a logic system, but more like a more or less difficult drawing. There are many kanji that look nearly the same, but once you study this book, these small differences become impossible to mistake.I am studying this book in spanish, but I've seen in english it's just the same, that's why I am reviewing this kanji study book. :) it has helped me so much..."
5,"A great book, but you have to know how to use it!","To begin, this is not a book to learn how to pronounce kanji. This book teaches you how to recognize & remember each kanji, and it does an incredible job of it.I first learned Japanese in college, and was taught the traditional romanji -> hiragana -> some kanji method. It stunk. I wish I had this book in school (and strangely enough, we used Hielsig's other wonderful books (in two books at that time) for learning Hiragana/Katakana in the class)You will learn the kanji with this book, and in such an easy way! I split the kanji into percentages, with about 100 kanji representing 5% of the total, and I had 5% of the total kanji under my belt in the first 2 weeks.As a final note, the review before this mentioned using flash cards. I know Heilsig had a method in his learning katakana book for a ""learning box"" using flash cards. I used it & I would highly recommend you look in the book for that technique.Buy this book, you will not be disappointed!"
3,Mistranslated Kanji????,"I find Heisig's book to be extremely helpful in memorizing the Kanji, its stroke order, but not its meaning. For example, there is a Kanji in his book listed as being ""Word,"" when in fact it is used as ""language"" Japanese. Other Kanji which he defines turn out to be slightly different from their actual meaning. I believe he did this in order to make memorization easier, but I find it odd to come across a Kanji, remember that it means ""X,"" but later find out that it also means ""Y,"" or is some slight variation on ""X."""
5,The Divine Ms M Live,"I have the VHS edition of this show and it is very good although a little tamer than some of her other live recordings. The ""1"" rating below is deceptive (especially since it is written in French). Their problem was the DVD wasn't compatible with their region, nothing to do with the actual content."
5,A Must have for amateur and veteran classical fans!,"Perfect for getting acquainted to classical music for the first time! All the best pieces on one cd which makes it a stand-out selection in anyone's collection. Once you've heard this one, you will want more and the RCA Victor classical music series is highly recommended and affordable. For the die-hard classical fan, this is the perfect one to take along with you in the car or the office."
5,This is my favorite knife!,I have one of these wusthof santoku knives for a few years and love it. I bought this one as a gift to my dad. I really think a good knife can make a life easier.
2,POOR QUALITY WUSTHOF,"After owning this knife for only several months the handle broke right near the hilt.The reason it did was because they use cheapo aluminum rivets instead of stainless and the aluminum corroded and expanded cracking the handle.They is the main reason they tell us not to put it in the dishwasher to clean, the detergent is corrosive to aluminum.I will never buy another Wusthof product, maybe made in China.Update: Just as I thought I found this site in China selling these knives:Prized possessions of professional chefs, Wusthof knives are an invaluable asset of any kitchen. Every element of this renowned cutlery contributesCategories: breakfast nook set canteen of cutleryEverdaily Houseware Co., Ltd. (China)"
3,Nice knife - but . .,". . the $39 Henckles 6 1/2"" Santoku that you can get here or at Target is about 90% as good as this knife, at 1/2 the price. These are really a ""show"" knife .. and are not the most practical choice.And note: I'm really turned off by all the supposed ""reviews"" for this knife and everything else on here that are obviously just planted and badly written marketing blurbs . . . kinda' insulting to one's intelligence . . .I feel like I'm shopping for a *bleepin'* Popiel Pocket-Fisherman or something . . ."
5,Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?,"Fierce. This is by FAR the best werewolf movie of all of them. I've seen most of them, I remember 80 when the big three came out...The Howling, Wolfen, and Bad Moon. I like all three, but this one takes the big trophy!! I also really liked American Werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps, Dog Soldiers and couple others are ok (""The Feeding"" was just really bad though)...but Bad Moon? Takes place in a modern middle class suburban neighborhood...not in the city gutters or just deep in the forest or whatever. I love the originality and modern feel of this one, and ohhh those special fx! The family German Shepard in this even deserved an award, what an actor!!"
3,"Thor, the leading man.. opps dog!",The best actor nomination goes to..... Thor!! The German Shepherd. I liked this movie pretty well. There are some large holes in the story line but one can get over them.( Having to do with hand cuffing oneself to a tree in the forest!) But it moves along in good order. I really did love the dog. Well trained and into his role. ( A little tongue in cheek here). I am happy that I bought it and the average viewer will probably enjoy it.
2,UH......THE WEREWOLF LOOKS COOL!!,"this movie had the right balance....A wicked wolf. Quite possibly the best looking Werewolf in the genre. Only a few things could have helped this movie. A GOOD STORY (every movie needs a plot) felt like this movie was a sequel. GOOD ACTORS AND ACTING, the movie lacked both. Dont get me wrong, I just liked the werewolf. I guess I really dont care for movies that have wicked effects and NO story to back it up. But the wolf does not disappoint. An overall less then mediocre horror movie."
2,"Bad director, bad!","God, this movie was....lame. I mean, it was lame. It limped; it struggled, it staggered. I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes. The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed? Check. The sleazeball guy getting killed? Check. The sleazeball guy practically begging for death? ""Here, doggie...""? That's eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back."
4,Air King 9230 review,"Would recommend the fan. Good air movement, easy to move, noise level is acceptable. Does not have a GFCI protection."
5,Fits the bill...,"This is the perfect knife for those in-between jobs. Larger than the paring knife, but smaller than the larger chef's knife. Fits perfectly in my knife block as well."
2,I Could Have Written This,"I love Angelina but this book was nothing I didn't already know. There was too much information about the other actors in the movies with her and no actual communication with her. I also noted several mis-prints that clearly should not have gotten past an editor. Like the fact that it was written that ""Playing God"" was released in 1977? Wasn't she like two? Great pictures and if I didn't know who she was or David Ducovany it might have been more interesting."
4,My Faithful Assistant,"Every week I am looking for ""just the right"" quote to include in the weekly bulletin I publish for my Adult Sunday School class. Every week I reach for ""The Speaker's Quote Book."" There is a nice variety of humorous and serious quotations and they are logically arranged. My only suggestion: a cross-reference by source name."
1,Misleading title,"This is NOT the ""Bad Attitude"" album; it's missing several of the songs from that album, including my favorite, ""Surf's Up."" Anyone wanting the real ""Bad Attitude"" album should visit the British Amazon store, amazon.co.uk, where it can be had for about $12 U.S."
3,So glad to see the Isley Bros on DVD,"I have many of their CD's and saw them in concert, back in the day and in this decade. Needed something on video and this is all I could find. For those who downed Ron's vocals, don't forget he had a stroke in 2004. He is doing good after that and just to be still in the biz after 50 years. Give up the props to my fave group. Also mad luv for Ernie who doesn't get the credit he deserves for his talent. He is one of the best. The rockers aren't the only ones that can whip that guitar."
2,FiestyTee,"Sorry for your troubles Roni, but your voice is dead on this concert. However, your band is fabulous. I must keep it real!"
5,beautiful watch,was a gift for wife....she loves it and wears it everyday... looks great on...can be worn for casual or dress.
3,Supplier cancelled my order,"I ordered the Wusthof Classic 7 piece knife block set for a Christmas gift. I paid for it with a credit card and received confirmation. I was then contacted with a phone call that the knives shouldn't have been listed on Amazon. A recall was issued for them as soon as they reached my destination. I never saw the Wusthof knives and block and was issued a credit. I feel this is a poor way to do business, but it was to my advantage because I found a better set for just a little bit more money."
2,It was not as good as the other two,"This book was not as good as the other two. It felt like it would never end, it had some good parts Vachon was in most of those. Compared to the others it was a disapointment."
5,"best of the ""best of Beethoven"" compilations","A great investment to get your classical music library going. Hits all the big ones - the ubiquitous first movement of the 5th symphony, the Vivace and ""Ode to Joy"" Choral from the 9th, the ""Moonlight"" Sonata and Fur Elise, Eroica, and, just for fun, the Turkish March from Ruin of Athens. Everyone's heard snippets, but for those looking to get a bit more in-depth, this CD's a great way to go. Good performances by the Boston and New York Philharmonics and talented individuals such as Emmanuel Ax. Sound quality is respectable as well.It's hard to imagine how someone could not be inspired by Beethoven's art. Listening to the Ninth is a transcendent experience if ever there was one. The music carries emotions that we try to give labels to such as joy, grief, and wonder, but the music defines them so much better than words. In any case, I was asked to review the CD not Beethoven - so, in short, this is a very good CD!"
3,It could have been 5 stars,"I was given one of these forks as a gift. It is a fabulous fork. The reason I gave it only three stars is that I recently bought a Calphalon knife set, and it came with a fork that is in every way the equal to this fork, yet even as an open stock item, costs a fraction of the price. If you must have the name, buy it. On the other hand if you want the best quality, and value your money.... there are alternatives."
3,Okay,"I'd read Hungry Spirits and Tempestuous before purchasing this book, hoping it would be as intriguing, well developed, and as lengthy as the prior two tales. Unfortunately it was much, much shorter. The book itself was slightly more than the same cost and nearly as many pages as Tempestuous, but about half the size page and much, much larger print than warranted. I liked the story, the plot was nice, the scenes were well developed... but I still felt cheated in that I paid more for this short story or small novella than I had for either of the other titles I'd purchased (which were developed, longer, twice as intriguing, and overall better). If you have the opportunity to pay less and get an e-book, DO. Torrid is nice. It wasn't worth $13 for the printed volume, though."
4,TORRID by Morgan Hawke,"A straight dance instructor is asked to play the part of a stripper at a bachelorette party. While shopping for his ""costume"", he meets a sexy and mysterious man who flirts with him. Though the dance instructor has never been attracted to men before, he can't help being intrigued by the sexy stranger, and they begin a sweet and steamy affair.This one is very cute and very sexy. ""But I'm not gay!"" is one of my favorite M/M themes (besides the ""best friends"" theme), so I really enjoyed this one. It's fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just hot men, spicy sex, a budding relationship, and a whole lot of fun."
2,Generic.,"There's nothing really special about this book at all. It was kind of a disappointment considering how good some of Elizabeth Chandler's other ""Love Stories"" books were. Instead, try another one by her: ""Hot Summer Nights."" It's more interesting."
5,Viaje todo pagado!,"Deberia de ser un titulo alterno para esta novela, no cabe duda que la autora se sabe de pies a cabeza nuestro Mexico, desde la situacion geografica, clima, comida, artesania, costumbres, razas indigenas, autores literarios, pintores, escrultores, TODO!Mas aparte narrado por medio de una mujer enamorada que recorre estos preciosos lugares en compañia de el hombre que la hace sentir diferente desde el primer momento que se vieron. Y por si fuera poco, la doble vida que lleva la protagonista con el firme proposito de juntar dinero para llevar a cabo un sueno junto con su hermano,fabulosa!"
1,review,"we did not get this game, we had it on the computer before and loved it.but we did not this game."
4,Windows XP compatible: ),"I was a little skeptic when I ordered it, not sure whether it is compatible with Windows XP. To my surprise, it did include a driver CD for Windows XP. Unfortunately, it seesm to be the basic driver, I still need to download the newest TWAIN drivers from their website.Once setup, this scanner is pretty easy to use and the scan quality is pretty good. The software package that came with it is just so so, but adaquet. Once you installed the TWAIN driver, you can just use your own softwares like Photoshop for more advanced graphics editing.The whole unit is very thin, looks pretty nice from the outside. The connection between the lid and the flatbed is weak, so probably need to be careful with it. And it makes strange sound when you turn on the computer."
5,A great invention...,"I absolutely love this appliance. I recently had my hair cut short and had to use a curling iron every day. This works great, I blow dry and curl at once and the curl lasts until the next time I wash. Saves me loads of time.I purchased this in 6/07 for $9.97 here on Amazon. A wise buy since it has since doubled in price.I would certainly purchase this again, and wouldn't even pause at the price increase."
3,Cards,"I thought I was going to get a package of SIx Handed playing cards, but instead I got a regular deck of cards with the 11's, 12's and 13's on the outside of the package in a plastic package. I know it is the same thing, but not exactly as advertised."
3,Love the energy hate the mixing,What a great great concert but the sound quality is poor to fair. I love OTIS but the concert from Monterray POP is much better. Only for true OTIS lovers!!
3,"Great performance, lousy mix","This is a good album. Otis gives a fine performance, and the crowd is way into it. Personally though, I feel the mixing of this recording borders on terrible. Otis' vocals take a back seat to the horn section, which is up far too loud. The drums are also a bummer, as they are practically inaudible. This is an album worth having, but not one worthy of being in the top 25 albums of all-time as Rolling Stone billed it."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED,"The Unit has cheap parts and if you are asking for a fllod in the bathroom, go ahead and install it. However the seller promptly refunded the price and I purchased another one ... I selected Luxe Bidet Neo 320 (Elite Series) .. it is better oprion and have flexible metal hoses for connecting cold and hot water. Plastic parts will leak due to water pressure and lack of compression fiting at end of connections."
4,A great little camera with some quality issues,"I've owned one of these cameras for about four years now, and I have been very pleased with it. It is light, small and easy to carry. It takes beautiful pictures--very sharp, and with good colors. The pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you can see the individual pixels.It was actually my second camera like this. The first had a problem with the USB port on the side of the camera, and I took it back to the store and traded it for a new one. This camera also had a problem too, after about two years, the button on the back that is needed for making settings stopped working properly.But still, considering the cost of the camera and the quality of the pictures, I will be buying another one. It's worth it."
4,Nice Scenery... Music Ok.,"This is beautiful south-western scenery. The colors are vivid, and relaxing. This was a good demo for a 50"" Plasma I bought for my parents. In many ways, the quality of the footage looks clearer than ""Blue Planet"" does. Most of the scenes are well composed. Most look professional, but a few minutes seem semi-pro. If you can get it at a good price, It's a great bit of footage to doze to."
2,WHERE's the heart !,"Petrucci and his pals really can play. Oh, how they can ! The production is amazing, the musicians stupendous, the songs fulll of rhythm changes and complex harmonies. But this is not rock. It really lacks emotion."
3,"Not Dream Theater's best, but there's a few good tunes","Awake was the first Dream Theater CD I bought after the incredible Images and Words release, and while it's not exactly a bad album, it doesn't hold a candle to the magic that happened with Images and Words. There are a few great songs in which the Images and Words magic does come through a bit, but for the most part I felt the album was uninspired and labored. What I mean by labored is sometimes Dream Theater puts so much emphasis on lyrics and trying to get a message through that the music part of the equation suffers and just becomes mechanical. High points of the CD include Hell's Kitchen, Space Dye Vest, and Lifting Shadows off a Dream. Low points include songs like Voices, which just make me want to kill myself, they're so empty. If you're looking to pick up some Dream Theater stuff, go with Images, Change of Seasons, or Scenes from a Memory. You won't be sorry.l"
5,dear MTV ROCKS....,"well,the album is reallyreally good,it was my first theather's one and i think i'll get others about DT soon!!I beg your pardon to all of you guys for what I'm going to write but I'd like to say sth to mr. Mtv Rocks..actually I think that mtvsucks,(and so did kurt cobain, your idol didn't you know it?),how can you say that avril lavigne is one of the best guitarist?a guitarist????avril lavigne??ahahahhh!!!I can play her songs better than her,and my cousin that is 6 does it too!punk??do you know what punk is??oh no, no, you don't man,there's some kind of problem..why do you keep writing meaningless reviews about metal bands(I saw the ones about ozzy ,acdc, maiden..) if you aren't able to understand their music??korn and linking park is metal??eheheeh!!you suck man!!"
5,one of the best albums of all time,"Forget Scenes from a Memory. Forget Images and Words. Awake is Dream Theater's best album and one the best albums of all time, period. As a concept it is seamless. The production is excellent. The lyrics and vocals are beautiful. The musicianship is top notch, as opposed to the shredding Dream Theater have been prone to in their later releases.The balance between the heavy and the soft stuff is perfect. Each track is a masterpiece in its own right. This is Dream Theater at their artistic peak. I've seen them live twice, but unfortunately they haven't played any cuts from Awake. ""Voices,"" ""The Mirror,"" and ""Lifting Shadows off a Dream"" are all favorites of mine, but honestly the band could play the whole album live and receive no complaint from me."
2,Technique without heart. Is this rock?,"Call what you want, but in this CD Dream Theater cannot be called a ""rock band"". It's a group of gifted players doing complex music for their own egos. But I enjoy listening to it, although I shouldconseul you to listen to classic music by Beethoven, Bach and others, if you want to hear real virtuosity!"
2,I can't stand it....,"I bought the Tidy Cats Litter Box Deodorizer the other day. Today I used it and I have to say that I won't keep using it. It has a really strong perfume like smell (almost like those things you hang in a toilet bowl to make is smell better). To me it smells disgusting. It might work, but I'm going to throw it out."
4,good for boring afternoons,I bought this for my 22 year old daughter. She loves it! Came quickly and in good condition. I love shopping Amazon!
1,Disc is Scratched more than a Cat with Flea's!,"I am a Huge Fan of Nip Tuck and was Highly dissapointed when I got my DVD's for Nip Tuck Season 4, the disc were all scattered in the case and looked like a Dj was Mixin them on a turntable!, everytime I started getting into the show it started skipping like a girl doing Hopscotch!, I want to return this just waiting on the seller to contact me!, Any Advice!P.S.Note to Seller....I dont want my money back I want Nip Tuck in My lIFE!thanks ,Aaron"
2,Nowhere near as good as previous seasons!,"An extremely disappointing season! I was a die hard Nip/Tuck fan until I watched Season 4. I kept watching hoping it would get better, but it seems the writers were really digging for material to keep us interested, and ended up with a bunch of ridiculous happenings that bounced from place to place. Nip/Tuck 'jumped the shark' this year with their look into the future, turning a present day suave and debonair Christian into a Liberace look alike. We could feel nothing but pity for Sean acting like a 90lb weakling throughout the season. The only thing that kept the interest was Joely Richardson's outstanding acting ability and the host of guest stars - Rosie O'Donnell was fantastic!"
1,Aburridísima,"There was a very entertaining campy insanity that made the first two seasons a delight to watch (the end of the second season, with that lovable ham Alec Baldwin, was very very clever and fun). The quality, however, began to go down in the third season, with the whole ""castrado"" thing, but the fourth season is just awful. Very very boring, or as we say in spanish, aburridísima: no ideas, no narrative logic, no risks, no fun. Even the sex in this one looks pretty tame. I mean, when I was a kid, I remember that I knew when a comic book was running out of ideas when Batman went to the future to meet with the martians or something. I had the same feling when I saw the ""Nip Tuck from the future episode"". Maybe things will get better in LA, who knows?."
5,One of the best,"One of the best animated animal tales I have seen in a while. Strong characters and plot and well placed songs. Im at a loss why others have given this movie such a low undeserved rating this is very much a five star movie if you love animated talking animal videos. Maybe it could be scary for five year olds not every animated video is ment for those under five. There are humans in this movie, the main character is Jock the dog. Standard animals can talk to each other but not humans type movie. Talking animals in this movie are as follows Jock a dog, his mother and litter mates, a rooster, and a few monkeys. This is very much a dog lovers movie however."
2,Pretty Painful to Watch,"The animation is okay but man this movie is just missing ""it"". It's tough to watch. You have zero attachment to the characters, and it's just overall really ""weird"". Maybe I'm spoiled by Disney, Pixar and Dreamworks or something but this was pretty rough to watch. I have no knowledge about the story and how accurate it is to the real story, but regardless of that this just was not very entertaining. It was also a little too dark and scary for my 5 year old as well, and the scary parts just seemed pointless and out of place."
3,"Disappointing, Don't read if you want to learn about Ireland","If you read the Irish Times regularly Rosita Borland is one of its writers who seems to have a relatively free rein to do the mildly eccentric, and as such is often enjoyable. However, this book tells you more about Rosita Borland and her life, what's in her display cabinet, what her family members have or have - than Ireland. I bought it because I am in a relationship with an Irishman and wanted to know more about the country ahead of my first visit, I gamely trudged through the pages, desperate for glimpses of Ireland. They were there, but not enough, Ms Borland billowed through the pages. Too self indulgent for my taste."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the first time I have ever felt ripped off on an Amazon purchase. I have never given a book 1 star and frankly it doesn't deserve that.The ""book"" consists of 20 pages of actual material which for the most part is useless since he doesn't explain any of his ""techniques"" except to refer you to one of his many books from "" The Ultimate Greyhound Betting System"" to ""Investing in En Primeur Wine"".The rest of the ""book"" consists of 82 pages of appendices and another 12 pages of the authors books along with summaries for additional filler.I'm glad I only got ripped off for 20 bucks. Don't be the next victim."
3,Love my body?,"Made in CAN in 1989, Serial# ACD-1257, Playing Time 55:08This is album #5 from the canadian ""metal queen"", and is filled with catchier tracks than her previous efforts. The energy is still there, but with perhaps more polish and commercial appeal than before.Some tracks seem to stand out more than others, possibly because there appears to be more passion in them. Good rock with strong vocals: the musicianship won't impress, but I think it's the most constant after ""Metal Queen""."
2,Two Lives - really such a good read?,"The book was recommended to me and after reading a review about it, I was really keen to finally read it. The first two parts of the book were coming up to my expectations, but I found it difficult to follow the events and persons of part III. Reading all those letters is exhausting and finally boring. All those introductions and ends of letters carry so much unnecessary information, it fills the pages of this book, but in fact interrupts the flow of the story. Even if the rest of the book makes up for some of the draw-backs of the letter-dominated part, all in all I was rather disappointed."
1,Terrible,"If I could rate this 0 stars, I would.The first few CDs were fine, but about 1/3 down through the stack, they were all scratched beyond belief. I had to separate those which were 'usable' and those which were shot. I would NOT purchase this again and would NOT recommend this product."
5,CD blanks,"what is there to say, work as advertised, came on time, and since I am using them to store all my old LP albums, write once was all that was needed."
4,"Reliable Discs, Great Price","I burn on both a standard Windows Media player (PC) and iTunes (on my home Mac), and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. In both frameworks, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended."
2,"maybe its my brand-new macbook, but...",about 15% of the cds in each pack (we bought 2) would not burn.
1,low quality,"I copied simple cds and used the entire 100 disks, and had a failure rate of 30%. You get what you pay for."
1,do not work,"I bought these around Thanksgiving, 2011.I have purchased a lot of different cd-r's over the years, including this exact product. I have the same problem as the other people. It doesn't burn music correctly. I have never had this problem before. It must be a bad batch of cd-r's. I am going to switch brands."
5,Lots of discs are a very good thing...,As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well...
3,Good for certain speed writers but no the faster...,"I've bought several packs of the Memorex CD-R's and they all worked great until I got a new computer with a faster CD-RW (48X). The CDs worked great with the slower writer on my older computer, but with the faster writer there is either some user error...or in the off chance that it actually burns it sounds like there is a strong wind in the background...very annoying. For someone with a 16x CD-RW I would recommend these...but not someone one with a higher write speed."
3,memorex CD-R,"It is OK,about 25 CD out of the 300 has defect.they did not burn completely.otherwise it is fine...with that price."
1,Compatibility issues -- disappointed,"I wish I hadn't bought 100 of them! I ran out of the TDK ones I had been using with no problem. I should have stuck with TDK, but instead went with Memorex since that is the brand of the burner and the price was so good. Anyway, now my burned cds won't play on my cd player (the same cd player that has no problem with the TDK CD-Rs)."
2,Southerlan - Pavarotti at their best,"This DVD has given me the opportunity to listen,see and enjoy, many times, these two great performers at their best. All the songs are the strongest of their repertoire and the presentation is great. I recommend this to all opera lovers."
2,not worth it a review from kevin f,fefe is a new singer in the year 2003 her debut alubm wasen't all that good her image is just to boring she is just like avirl lavigne a nother rock girl
1,"No soul, just hype","I would like to make it my personal mission to stop this hideous non-talent's career immediately. This ""artist"" has no redeeming qualities whatsoever...ridiculously oversung songs with no soul. this is music for eight year olds, whose tastes are transitioning from teletubbies to avril. in the middle, there is fefe."
1,oh boy,I want to like fe fe but her voice is so annoying and she can't write and her band is horrible. But not as horrible as her voice. She makes me want to get all those pop albums I regret buying and get hers and burn them together to a crisp.
5,FeFe Dobson,"FeFe Dobson is a very talented young artist. From what I have seen and heard of her on TV and seems to be a very down to earth type of person.I also read about she story about growing up without her father around, and being rather poor as a result. She also also grew up in an all white family. Her younger brothers and older sister have blond hair blue eyes like their mother, while FeFe is different from her family becasue her dad is black.She got teased because she is biracial in an all white family.She is a very strong person who would through a lot of trials and tribulations to get to where she is. She has a lot of room for growth and alot to learn, however the potential is there. She just has to work hard at it.I will continue is suppor artists like FeFe Dobson."
3,"Poser, anyone?","I think that Fefe Dobson is a poser, just like Avril Lavigne. Their music is the same. They're both like: ""I'm just a skater chick!"" They think they're punk. But for all of you Fefe Dobson fans, do you know what punk rock is? Well, it isn't Fefe and Avril.I think that for a pop artist though, Fefe is good. I bought the CD having higher expectations. Even though I don't like her poser image, the CD is alright. She has a decent voice, much better than Britney and Jessica.I would give this album 3 and a half stars, but that isn't an option. If you're expecting a pop artist from Fefe, go ahed and buy it. But if you're expecting a different genre from her (especially punk rock), don't buy it."
1,Music Fans Beware,"I personally am an avid fan of music. I enjoy all different types, rock, broadway, 60s, 70s, jazz, you name it, I've probably been into it at one time or another. My point is that, while trying to unbiased-this is album is definately one of the worst albums of a new artist. ""Stupid Little Love Song"" is undoubtedly one of, if not the most utterly unbearable songs I've ever heard. I'm not against pop/punk stuff, I do find some of it entertaining, but these songs are really the worst. ""Stupid"" truly characterizes this album, I view this as a real setback for new artists. The sound, frankly, is terrible. If you do not believe me, give a few songs a try and see for yourself. (it is IMPERATIVE you listen to ""Stupid Little Love Song"" to understand my reasoning)"
4,Move over avril!!,"this debut cd is so good! rock it, julia, everything, and take me away are probably the best! this is one of the best cds everbuy it!"
5,My Favorite CD,"I can't get enough of this album! It is ultra addictive. I can't bring myself to remove it from my CD player. Critics have compared her to Avril Lavigne but she's beat Avril at her own game. I have her CD also and I love it. But Let Go doesn't begin to compare to this. I hope Fefe matches or surpasses the success of Avril because she is more talented in every way. For someone who is only eighteen, she is a great songwriter - she penned every song. Half of the songs are great, the other half are good or really good. The greats ones are: Stupid Little Love Song, Bye Bye Boyfriend, Take Me Away, Everything, Rock It Till You Drop It, Unforgiven and Give It Up. My least favorite song is We Went For A Ride. It has that Tracy Chapman Fast Car vibe. Fefe Dobson's debut is a must have!"
4,Great to film outside,"This is a great rain cover, I use it for the DVX-100. I would prefer if t had a filter adapter in front to attach a filter, but besides that it's a great cover, pretty flexible and you can control everything with your hand inside, or on a tripod."
4,The MARIO LANZA Collection,extract from most important LPs. Brilliant sound quality from RCA. Also included are soundtrack recordings from some of his movies. The are several reissues from Mario Lanza but this one is a collection you should have.
4,Good Musical Memories,Mario Lanza's voice was among the best and it holds up against any singer now.
2,Disturbing.,"NOT a heartwarming account of travels with Daddy, this book is more like an inside view of life with a chronically unemployed, alcoholic drifter, in which the boy is neglected, filthy, near starved, and on several occasions sexually abused. From the cover notes, I had thought it would be something my family could listen to in the car, but definitely not. Well written, it held my interest, but I could only digest it in small pieces."
4,Great album - much better than their latter years!,"Any TRUE INXS fan should not be without this album...It is by far one of their best. On a Bus and Learn to Smile are excellent songs, and Roller Skating is another good one. While this album may not have the big production sounds of the bands later albums, it has the rawness of a new band that has not sold out."
3,Book was in great shape. Was close to being new and arrived in a very timely manner,"The book was in the condition it stated on-line. I was very pleased with the turn around time in receiving the book.The cookbook, itself, is less than I had anticipated. I have used a few recipes but some are not things my family would eat as well.Again, I can not compliment the seller on the condition and speedy delivery.For someone who would use ""out of the norm foods"", this would be a good buy.D. Smith"
1,So glad that's over,"I was so glad when this book was OVER. It promised so much more than it delivered. I kept Waiting and Waiting to find it worthwhile, but never did."
3,Not fully agreeing with most of the other reviewers,"I really don't understand the great reviews. I just don't see what those reviewers see. There were no horror or supernatural aspects in this book to me. I thought it was on the boring side...I thought it was way too long...I thought the ending was forced......I did however think the author had a great premise for this book...and finally the author kept me reading to the end (I've shelved other books half way through before for being boring - so the fact I finished the book in ""un-record"" time is amazing!).Most of the book was predictable, while other parts seemed to be made up after the first draft of this novel and simply thrown in (like Bessy's mom towards the end of the novel).Overall I was very disappointed as I lugged this hard back book around in my purse for over a month."
4,I raced through this book,"because of its intriguing plot and lively first-person narrative. At the end, I was wishing the author would write a sequel and tell us that Bessy had turned her talent (musical one, that is) into a career and a new life for herself. Combining to make for a roller coaster of a read were the earthy, mischievous, forever loyal and loving, and highly simpatica Irish Bessy; characters and scenes that often made me laugh out loud as I visualized them; an intriguing mystery; and an interesting look at mental illness and the servant-mistress relationship in Victorian times. I'm looking forward to more like this from the author."
4,"Jesus Murphy, this is a good one!","I am not really a fan of historical fiction but someone recommended ""The Observations"" to me because I like Barbara Vine (aka Ruth Rendell) and this book does indeed have a Vine-ish tone. I was totally enamored with the young Irish girl protagonist, Bessy, whose sense of humor and acute observations keep the book moving. Part mystery, part supernatural, and part social manners, the book moves to a suspenseful conclusion that I must confess, is quite moving if not altogether satisfying. Still, despite that and it being a tad overlong and a few characters who speak in heavy dialect (fortunately, their parts are small), this one is a page-turner."
2,I AM Diana Cooper,"Diana Cooper's ""Angel inspiration"" is not my kind of spirituality. However, the book is probably a very mixed bag even for those who do believe in angels. The first part of Cooper's book contains the usual, uplifting anecdotes and miracle stories about angelic inspiration. Later, the work gets progressively more cultic.Cooper claims to have information about a long list of Ascended Masters identical to those revered by Guy Ballard or Elizabeth Clare Prophet: St. Germain, Kuthumi, Mother Mary, the Goddess of Liberty, etc. Even the terminology is similar: Violet Flame, transmutation, I AM, decree, etc. Apparently, there is also a Silver Violet Flame. Various meditation exercises are included.I don't know who Diana Cooper might be, but she has clearly been studying the material of the I AM Activity and the Church Universal and Triumphant."
4,Great music! Not so great vocals.,"This CD contains some wonderful work. The music itself is very atmospheric and is comprised of flowing melodic goodness. The well composed. The one thing I dislike about the album is the vocals. They are DRENTCHEDDD in reverb and the singers dynamic NEVER changes. I really feel that the vocals pull down hard on the other instruments. All in all, it's a good listen. Still worth the purchance. I just wish they would have listened back after recording :P"
4,Why is their vocalist screaming all the time?,"Seriously, this band is amazing! But why does their singer suck so much? We already have a mess of screamers and growlers and such, why can't he just sing? Sure, he may be angry or sad or whatever, but there are plenty of other ways to express that emotion instead of repeated and boring screams. They just plain suck. Rosetta doesn't even need a singer, they would sound a whole lot better without one.The instrumentation on this album is sick! Drumming is stunning, the guitar and bass lines are epic and creative, but their vocalist is horrible. Another screamer screaming to be ""heavy"", I guess."
4,solid for building muscle,"I purchased this system over 2 years ago and am very impressed for the price. I am a personal trainer with access to a full gym, but still prefer to work out at home so I don't have to fight for machines/weights.I have had 500 lbs on this system and it took it like a pro. With the attachments, this is almost a complete gym right in your home! You get all the advantages of a smith machine for heavy solo lifting, or a power cage/rack for free weight work. this system is worth every penny. The reason I didn't give it a 5? The FID bench with it is good, but not great...one, its a little higher than gym benches (I have short limbs) so sometimes it can feel akward.if you don't like the gym, and like to lift, this system is a top pick!"
2,Not an actual S&W knife,This is an okay knife. The blade is a cheap quality steel and rusts quickly. The blade is a Taylor company model used by S&W for over load products. Not really worth the 20 you would spend
1,Don't buy anything from GoVideo!,"I don't have this TV but the company itself is horrible. A DVD recorder that is only 2 years old broke (disk tray won't open) and I emailed Go Video for help since it was impossible to get them by phone. Here is the response email I got and I quote: ""Go Video no longer offers tech support or customer service."" Need I say more?"
2,a brief diversion,"A while back on rec.arts.books, someone asked for any recommendations of authors like P.G. Wodehouse. In the ensuing responses, this thin little volume by Durrell was mentioned. I recognized Durrell's name from my research into travel literature, and thought I'd give his humor a try. These are short stories, told to an unseen chronicler (and fellow diplomat) by an older collegue named Antrobus. The service is foreign, in a generic country name Vulgaria (a cute little dig at snobbish English diplomats). While the language is quite pleasant, and some of the situations quite amusing, what Durrell is missing is that sense of plot known as the conclusion (or, as a character says here, ""the pay off""). Durrell tries, but never seems to get it right. I enjoyed it as a brief diversion (the book is less than 90 pages), but doubt I'll be looking for more."
5,Great pads,"Standard pads on my 2006 Dodge Charger, after using Duralast Gold disc pads and about 1 year later having damaged rotors, I decided to use these pads on my Grand AM GT. Just what I needed - high temperature, ceramic, low dust pads"
1,Batteries didn't last 6 months.,"Bought three batteries at a good price, but none of the batteries can keep a charge after 6 months. Find another vendor."
3,Short Life Battery,The life of the battery did not last as long as I thought. The charge was good but this is the second time we ordered one for the phone in less than 18 months. I have had other phones for years and not had to change out the rechargeable battery. I think I would try a different kind next go round.
2,Short Battery Life,"I purchased 4 of these batteries in April, 2009 from ebatteries. I used the batteries to replace the original 2420 batteries in my AT&T; E5634B cordless phone. The initial performance of the batteries was good, but unfortunately this only lasted a few months. After 6 months of use I was only getting about 15-20 minutes of talk time on two of the batteries, and about 30-35 minutes of talk time on the other two.The cost for shipping and handling was more than the cost of the batteries. The total cost of the order, including shipping and handling, was $29.40, which works out to be $7.35 per battery."
5,fit replacement,I have an older out dated set of cordless AT&T phones and the stores no longer carried this type of battery. These replacements worked perfectly..
5,A book to be re-read over and over,"I've re-read this book so many times over that I've lost count. It's such a fun read. I'm nearly 18 years old and I enjoy this book so much I HAD to buy it. If you like the Spiderwick Chronicles BOOKS (Not the movie, and if you've seen the movie and haven't read the books, shame on you. The books are much better) and strange stories such as Coraline, you'll enjoy this book as well.I've finally ordered this book because I've read it tons of times from the local library. Imogene, Maxine, and Adrian are three wonderfully real characters in my opinion.I really do think that if you like strange, slightly dark, comical, and intriguing stories, I think you'll enjoy this book as well. This book has led me other De Lint books as well, I have yet to find any to read at the library yet, but I will continue searching."
5,great kit for first tattoo goo first timers,"this kit is amazing. Not only did it come with everything I needed, but everything worked so well. The sizes are perfect for travel so I can take the soap and lotion to work with me whenever I needed to. It helps ensure you give your tatt's the cleanliness/love they need so that they can turn out great. Also, many more things were included in the box then the site listed. But I'm not complaining. Great product, GREAT price."
4,Effective Business Writing,"I find this book very helpful. I feel it is very important to stay abreast of the ""latest"" information about effective writing in the business world as it does change frequently."
3,The good days,Johnny gill back in the day i love good r&b;new artist like Jeremih and Tiec Toccbring me back to that a little
3,"Cool knife, but emblem fell off","We bought this very expensive knife to be a premium kitchen accessory to last a lifetime. It is solid, sharp, and looks great.HOWEVER, after only 1 year of use, the emblem fell off. It is just attached with glue on the handle. Although we used the knife daily, we kept good care of it. It was quite disappointing for it to come apart like this, especially after believing it was forged from the same piece of steel and that $140 would result in a knife that would last a lifetime. It does not look good without the emblem. I contacted Wusthof USA, and they said I could mail it to them (at our expense) and they would repair it. In that case, we'll probably just buy superglue and do it ourselves. We are not the first reviewer to mention this emblem problem with their products, and this should have been fixed by now, especially when selling ""premium"" expensive products such as this."
3,"Older book, but fun to read","I thought this book would be more of a trivia style book, but instead it reads like a collection of interesting facts about the actors and actresses on Y&R.; This book is not associated with the show so some of the facts really aren't that interesting as they have nothing to do with the soap. However, I did enjoy reading through it.Update: I noticed that used copies of this book are now available on amazon for over $100, and in light of this I have to say that it is NOT a collectors item by any means and certainly is not worth the hefty price tag. Yes I enjoyed reading it, but I purchased it for under $5. I would have been horrified if I had spent more money than that because it really isn't associated with the show, and many of the actors that are used in the book only had a short stint on the soap."
3,A Dog Year,"It was a very cute story, great action with the dog, but whatever happened to to the second Rectriever who was left behind? Never any mention of him.Jeff Bridges was outdone by the border Collie!Maybe fun for children."
1,I'd rather watch paint dry or grass grow,"I hate to join the choir, as it were, but I have to agree-this book is a humungous letdown, especially seeing that it comes from the Moxley expert and such a big publishing house. Can any semi-celebrity just publish tripe these days? I started this book convinced that more than one assassin did in JFK and I ended the book still believing---knowing---the very same thing. Publisher's Weekly got it right (for a change): use this book as a doorstop...as long is it is a single door, not a double door (ouch). What's next---""THE EARTH IS REALLY FLAT"" BY O.J. SIMPSON????????????????????????????Brian Craig"
1,A quick buck,"anything to make a easy dollar. This book and I use the term losely is a total joke. If you really want to know about the JFK muder conspiracy just watch the Zapruder film and turst your own eyes. The only place the fatal shot could've come from was the picket fence on the grassy knoll. And folks, the film validates, it was an entrance wound. Ferhman is a fool"
5,"""What is Truth?""","The book brought into focus and clarified many details of the Kennedy killing that were obscured in every handling of the case with the exception of ""Case Closed.' Furhman's theory fits. I read the book with skepticism wondering how he could solve a crime hundreds have tried to solve without success. The book was a genuine surprise. The author did his homework and presented evidence to support his theory. Good job."
1,Never received,Never received this item. Never received message that they did not have this item or that it was on backorder. Do not order from these people.
2,Don't expect quality recordings,I am a huge Christy Moore fan but was left with a hollow feeling after listening to these recordings. The majority are B sides for a reason. The sound quality is terrible in many places and Christy's voice unrecognizable - though he was very young in some of the recordings. I would recommend for the fanatic who owns all of Christy's recordings and wants to get his/her hands one something new.Slan abhaile
4,"Not her best, but it's kool!!!","""Beauty and the Beast"" as well as ""Stand Back"", make the record good. The songs are good, but I wanted more. SN is a the queen of Rock and Roll,and 4-ever staying that way!!!!"
3,"Nice, but...","The video Quality is great. However, you'll realize you're not missing much if you turn it off after just a few minutes. Endless waves on various beaches and shores, over and over and over again."
5,Great music,"Totally agree with previous reviews. They did release another album called One Man's Poison, very hard to find but just as good if not better than Hands of Faith."
4,Great Album,"This band is incredible and breaks the stereotype of ""European"" music. This CD is very original, poppy, and eclectic. The music is, as others have said, universal. It helps to know a little French, however. The first track is excellent as well as ""Immobile"" and ""L'eau qu'il Dort."""
5,TCM deals with natural laws.,"Very easy to understand. Learned a lot about how TCM views the body/mind/spirit. Makes total sense. Loved the 10 simple movements, & learning about foods that help to heal the body."
4,Great book,We ordered Great Leaders of the Christian Church for a class our son was taking. We enjoyed reading it too. Amazon gave us great service.
4,Family Fun,I remember reading about this when it first came out and have kept it in the back of my mind ever since. Finally picked it up and saved it for a spring break road trip with the family.My five year old loves classical and the whole family enjoyed the music and the story. Mr. Bowie does a wonderful job with the narration. I would love to hear something else along these same lines from him.
3,As an AI fanatic...,"I found this book good, but I expected there to be more about his AI expirence I really like the ""I dont mean to be rude but..."" segments and I just with there was more elaborations and on the show and maybe he could have gone over his feelings of more of the ""now"" stars. And I would have liked to see a where they will be on season one."
3,You're going to...like it!,"Simon delievers plenty of backstage gossip to sate 'Idol' fans' curiosity and more importantly, a reality check for the thousands of aspiring musicians hoping to make it in the music biz."
4,Interesting read,"This book has some interesting views of the contestants, the show and the people behind the show. For those of you who loved Simon on American Idol, you'll enjoy this book. He also explains why he is deliberately blunt on the show. The folks who give it a bad rating are probably fans of someone on the show who got bad reviews by Simon and are trying to sabotage the book. Notice the ones that give bad ratings do not give any reasons- they have no clue what the book is about. I give it 4 stars because it is a little overpriced."
4,The Real Simon Cowell,"My wife bought this book at Wal-Mart two days ago. I was quite surprised.She informed me that it was the last copy available and she thought we might enjoy it what with our enjoyment of American Idol. She was right. It is very insightfull starting with Simons background from the beginning to the current day. This coupled with an interesting take on the contestants and the judges makes this a must have book for those interested in the ""American Idol"" show. Fascinating to say the least and realy explains how Simon thinks."
2,It is for US use only,"People who did this atlas wanted to cut their job and limited the Eastern Europe by deviding it by two parts. One and very big part of the Eastern Europe is not in the Historical Atlas. The biggest European countries such as Ukraine and Russia as well as other countries - Baltic states, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, etc. are not concidered to be Europe in so called Historical Atlas of the Eastern Europe. I would reccomend the authors to get some geography lessons before making any other job..."
1,Watch Silly Salad Bowl Man Kill and Kill!,"Once upon a time, there was Silent Night, Deadly Night. It was alright. Me and my friends get together and watch bad horror movies frequently. Part One met the bill well. It was silly and gruesome and all around funny to us. Then we watched Part Two. It wasn't so hot. The first half of it was showing clips of the first movie. Yuck. Then tonight we viewed Part Three, or the one I'm writing the review for. It was bad. Real bad. Ricky is revived, and walks around with a salad bowl on his head instead of a skull. Great. Out of nowhere, they dropped the nun theme and went with a blind clairvoyant. Ok....as if that makes sense. It was predictable, and just not fun. If I wasn't insensitive to enjoy making blind person jokes the whole movie, I probably would have gone insane from boredom. (You know us teenagers. It's like we all have ADD). Anyway, the movie sucked. Don't see it. I would have given it 0 stars if they would have let me."
1,Totally waste of time,"At the time Monte Hellman did ""Silent Night, Deadly Night 3"" he was at the lowest point of his career. It seems to me that he was in desperately need of money I have no other explanation why the director of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" or ""The Shooting"" would have accepted to do this brainless and uninspired horrorflick. Although I haven't seen the first two ""Silent Nights"" (to be honest, I only watched this film because of Mr. Hellman being the director !) this Santa Claus thing is for the pits !"
4,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"I bought this to film inside of a club. The battery was a bit hard to find, but Frys had it finally.The actual light was too bright so I ended up not even using it. Definitely recommend it for those needing more focused light."
3,The bulb does not last long,"I use it for shoot wedding and the was lights is perfect..I love it, but the bulb only last for 4 weddings. if u have extra money to keep buying for spare bulb, no problem. But once again the light is perfect for wedding, not to bright, and enough to shoot in dark reception rooms."
1,Camcorder light,This product works very well but I was cheated because it was supposed to come with a battery but the battery had been removed from the package. I contacted Amazon and they gave me a $16.00 refund. I had to spend $42.00 to get a replacement battery. I did not have time to send the item back because I needed the light to record Christmas home movies. When I wrote a second email to Amazon I got no response. I guess Amazon thinks it is okay to get cheated out of $26.00. I know they are not legally obligated to help more than this but it is ethically wrong.
5,Looks good on my Canon XL1s,The light works great and looks good on my Canon XL1s. Just what I needed for those shots I wanted but could not get before. I would recommend this item and thanks to [...] for helping me find it.
3,it's good,"the maid is a good horror japanese horror movie. not great, but good. the story follows the lines of a maid not following the rituals to keep ghosts away during the 7th month. there are a couple of good scares. the acting is okay. i found the dialogue frustrating though as some of it was in english and some of it was subtitled. i have never liked that presentation. either make it one way or another. there has already been a ton of j-horror ghost dvds flooding the market. this is a good movie to rent or borrow, as you'll probably watch it once or twice, but i would not add it to your horror collection. that's just my opinion though...."
2,"This would be a great product, if it stayed in place . . .","When this product arrived, I was excited to finally have a sunscreen that would protect my face, which is extremely oily. A few minutes after application, I was surprised to find that the product began to roll off like dead skin. Now, if I'm feeling patient enough to use it, I mix it with my oil controller (which for non-oily people would be moisturizer) and that seems to keep it from rolling away. A fantastic product, however, should not need to be mixed with anything."
4,Good Workout,I bought this DVD based on the reviews stating it was a good intro to pilates. It really is a good workout. I also bought at the same time the Giam Beginning Mat Workout. I should have started with the Beginning Mat Workout DVD as it has modifications to some of the exercises I had difficulty with on the Pilates for Weight Loss. Still it's a great workout and I will continue to do it.
4,Love it!,"This is my second Ana Caban pilates video and I think she's great. Excellent cues in regards to breathing, neck positioning (just when she says to pull my shoulders away from my ears, I realize that they were there) etc. I wish she explained or showed a bit more modification for some of the harder moves, but I've been able to make it work and love this video! 30 minutes goes by in a flash....and I feel like I've really worked my body after this video."
3,Good for beginners...,"This video has many of the same moves repeated in Ana Caban's other workout videos.This video is ideal for beginners who know a little already about the Pilates method.Breathing is not gone over, but the exercises consist of basic, traditional pilates moves, simplified for those who are not quite ready for intermediate mat work."
3,"Good for streching, bad for weight loss","I am new to pilates, but not new to working out. After packing on a few too many holiday pounds, I thought I'd give this DVD a try. For the most part I enjoyed the ""workout"", though I can't really call it that. I did not break a sweat at all and certainly didn't feel as though I got a full body toning exercise. It provided a fun way to stretch, and worked the abs a bit, but I didn't feel like I got a good workout at the end.I didn't really like the way Ana Coban seemed to talk to you as though you were a child either, but it wasn't unbearable.I would recommend this DVD for someone who likes movement, stretches, and wants to increase balance and flexibility, but not for someone serious about weight loss, as there's a lack of anything cardio or strength training related."
3,Did what I needed,More like mice than rats. Easy to work with and made excellent Jello mice. Just expected bigger end product due to the name.
2,Disappointing Version of a Very INteresting Life,"THIS VERSION IS DISAPPOINTING. TEDIOUSLY DULL. LUDWIG II WAS ONE OTHE THE MOST COMPLEX AND INTERESTING KINGS OF HIS DAY. THIS BOOK TELLS VERY LITTLE OF THE PERSONAL OR PUBLIC LIFE OF THE KING. YES, HE WAS MAD AS A HATTER, OR SHOULD IT BE CRAZY LIKE A FOX. HE WAS A HARMLESS HOMOSEXUAL THAT LOVED BEAUTY. HE WAS AN ADEQUATE, IF UNINSPIRED KING TO HIS PEOPLE UNTIL THE LAST. IN EARLIER HISTORY, HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED SO BADLY. THIS RENDITION IS MISSING SO MUCH OF THE MAN. IT ISN'T EVEN HALF THE STORY."
1,Amazon Info entirely wrong for this piece of CRAP,"The cast listed for this title is wrong!!!!! No Judy Davis etc,,are there two movies with the same title? Anyway,,,,the summary given about SF and painter/killer plot is correct to my sorrow,,,I bought this because of the favorable reception at the SF festival,,this is junk,,junk of a high order I will grant you but a total waste of viewing time,,so many flashbacks many of which are just a few seconds long,,,an attempt to be overly-arty I presume,,the director is one I will watch (out) for and do my best to avoid,,I was one of the minority who hated Memento and I think this falls in the same ""nothing to say"" genre,,the added DVD feature on making the film is one of the most boring and ineffectual pieces of self indulgence I have witnessed in a long time. Rent if you must but dont expect anything of the view."
5,Works well,"These are well packaged, and shaped nicely. They plug in solidly and appear to be well made. Using these is way better than straining some cable in a tight place. I'm happy with the AudioQuest right angle adapters I've used in general (I also use an IEC plug adapter on my projector which is close to a wall), and this is no exception."
5,It's like Candy,"The actor singing Cameo's ""Candy"" is worth the price of admission. There are some hella funny scenes in this movie-- and Garrett Morris should have won an Academy Award for this character."
1,This dollhouse one is just plain stupid....watch the 1st one,"Dollhouse is not worth watching and i regret watching it. Concept is interesting but the screenplay and acting is bad and because of that, it wasn't scary. Just like alot of bad acted and script movies on a good concept, it can destroy the movie entirely and this one takes the cake. If you don't believe me, watch it for yourself. The special affects team should be fired for doing such a terrible job at it, if one can call that special affects. I call it a joke. I recommend watching the first one of the series and stop at that. No. 8 must be the worst along with 'the new generation' amityville episode."
3,Aunt and Uncle take the cake...,"Funny in places and disgusting in others, but the occultist aunt and uncle are the best. The biker uncle seems to me to be the real hero!"
1,paperback instead of book,I RECEIVED A SMALL PRINT/ SMALL FONT PAPERBACKINSTEAD OF THE BOOK I ORDERED.I PAID BOOK PRICE.
5,The coolest album in the universe,"I LOVE this album! It makes the music of your parents seem really cool (in fact, I first encountered it thanks to a friend who swiped it from her mom). Bobby and Johnny are absolutely unrepentant square white guys in suits, having a swell time hamming their way through magnificently orchestrated numbers like ""My Cutie's Due at Two-Two-Two Today"", and they even do a JELLY ROLL tune. Mark my words, Quentin Tarrintino is gonna use this album in one of his soundtracks someday, and it will be hip all over again."
3,Run for your life here comes the dust mites,"I must say I expected a lot more than this book delivered. This book was very scientific to the point to where if you haven't study genetics for the past 4 years you could go completely brain dead trying to figure out what they are trying to explain. It focused on the scientific to the point to where it doesn't really develop any of the characters in the book. It is a very scary what if scenario, but it never really explains some things for example (WHERE DID ALL THE INSECTS GO). They just disappeared.The action at the end of the book is intense but it is over before it really even develops. It had the potential to be a great science fiction novel but just didn't really deliver to me.However I do recommend this book. It is a good novel of how humanity can be destroyed without a bomb going off. uhhhhh wait there are bombs also for you actions fans lol. All in all a good book, but only 3 stars here."
3,"Quite Commerical, But Not Bad","This album was much more in the commerical direction than Robert Plant's previous three efforts. This album has it's moments here and there, but it's disappointing a little because there's not much of a progressive feel like the other albums: especially Shaken 'n' Stirred. The musicianship and production are good though. Best songs would have to be ""Heaven Knows,"" Dance On My Own,"" and ""Walking Towards Paradise."" The keyboards don't play such an integral role as in the last album. The songs on Now and Zen are very pop-oriented. All in all, an okay release."
4,Robert Plant's Now and Zen in 5 Sentences or Fewer,"Now and Zen found Robert Plant swinging his musical pendulum back to a more guitar-based sound which was a welcome change after 1985's awful Shaken `N' Stirred (""Little By Little"" being the one good track on that album). Jimmy Page joined his old bandmate to contribute on the two biggest hits of Now and Zen (""Tall Cool One"" and ""Heaven Knows"") but Plant also incorporated keyboards and other sounds of the time. In doing so, he gave credence to his rock roots without making it sound like an almost-Zeppelin classic rock recording. While some of the instrumentation certainly ties Now and Zen to his 1988 release year, it's still a fun listen and a good one for an afternoon drive on the freeway with the windows (and the pedal) down. You should give it a listen and enjoy the memories."
1,the decline of the ciupciup,why some people doesn't accept the natural course of age and don't retire at the right moment?mr. plant used to be a nightingale but now he has a scratchy throat. buy the led zeppelin records instead.
4,"Look neat, but melted some.","These are neat looking. They melted some in the icing, which didn't look pretty. Shipping price was a little high. I got 2 bags but only used half a bag for 2 dozen cupcakes."
3,What you expect for Haynes,"This book is adequate to help me work on my ""new to me"", 30 year old Yamaha. Good basic information, but it leaves me wanting more pictures and diagrams. This book covers many models, so the detail for my particular bike is sometimes lacking or hard to find. Note that this book is English, so you get spanners instead of wrenches and tyres instead of tires. There is an English to American translation guide though. I got a kick out of that!"
2,Not as good as the original!,"The thing that made the first Monster at the End of This Book so good was the interaction between Grover and the child. This book lacks that. The interaction is between Grover and Elmo. It's an OK book, but a real let down after the first one."
3,As promised,THis was a gift to help my husband pass the time. It arrived as promised and he enjoys playing some of the games.
5,I loved it!,This is the second book of the series and like the first I loved it. The characters are so strong and I never got bored throughout the book. I am looking forward to the third book now. MJP is a great story teller and I enjoy all her books.
4,"A MUST For Any Network Marketer, Experienced or New!","This book is a MUST for any Network Marketer. Whether you are a 'newbie', a 'big-hitter', or just contemplating the fact of whether or not to join the Network Marketing industry, you should get your hands on a copy of this book.This book is instructional AND motivational. Basically it is a compilation of case studies of big hitters in the MLM industry. All the individuals featured have had endeavors with MLM in the 'wave-two' days and have failed. Each chapter describes a different individual who went from just Average Joe (or worse off), all the way to the top of the ranks AND how they did it!!Hopefully, this book will help YOU TOO build a successful GIANT organization as I am using it to build now.Dave"
4,Headlamp,"Pros: Nice headlamp, bright with adjustable tilt.Cons: Works with 2x3V batteries included, not rechargeable and no focus adjustment.Good for night hiking and odd job handiwork, not too good for reading."
3,It's okay,"If you're used to Dolphina or Neena and Veena and looking for the same type of workout, this isn't it. It is too instructional and doesn't provide a seamless flow from one segment to another so there is no way to keep the heart rate up. On the other hand it is very very basic instruction and you don't learn anything knew if you have experience with Dolphina and the like. the production quality seemed grainy and not up to snuff with other tapes.Now for the good points. I have always had trouble with a belly roll, but this tape explained the technique of the move extremely well. Secondly, there are quite a few preformances of top belly dancers, So it's partly a preformance tape. The belly demonstration by Fatimin (?) is worth the price of the tape in my opinion. If I can ever control my belly like that I could cause accidents!:) I do think that it is a good tape for basic instruction but as a workout soley, save your money."
5,Classic Chieftains on stage!,"My first exposure to the Chieftains, Ireland's ""Musical Ambassadors,"" many years ago. For those wishing to expose their musical tastes to Irish music, this is a great album to start with. This particular album reveals the Chieftains' true stage presence. A must buy for any Chieftains fan!"
4,Re-packaged King Biscuit performance,"This is an import album that is the same as the 1995 King Biscuit America In Concert album although the songs are in a different order. The songs come from a performance at the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, on September 4, 1982. Playing with Gerry and Dewey were Willie Leacox (drums and percussion), Brad Palmer (bass guitar), and Michael Woods (lead guitar). It is a solid performance. Here is the song listing:SandmanVentura HighwayCalifornia Dreamin'Old Man TookTin ManDaisy JaneHereLove On the VineI Need YouSister Golden HairInspector MillsYou Can Do MagicHorse With No NameNever Be Lonely"
5,Hidden gem,"Great,obscure group, a cross between the STOOGES and the GROUNDHOGS,eventually available on cd,unlike the elusive original lp,when you have this black diamond in yours hands,then play on and on."
5,Excellent concert,"This is a must to have for your Jazz collection. Selection of performers, sound and video quality is GREAT. Highly recommend this concert. If you like jazz you can not go wrong with this disk."
2,Stevie needed to rock some more,"""Rock a Little"" contains a couple of decent singles in ""Talk to Me"" and ""I Can't Wait"" and a bunch of fairly bland filler material. There is little hint on this record of just what a first rate songwriter Nicks was during the late 1970s and even through her far superior first solo album, ""Bella Donna."" By this point, stardom had apparently robbed Stevie of her ambitions, and she was content to merely release mediocre albums to fulfill her recording contract."
2,for serious Stevie Fans only,"The two hit singles, Talk to Me and I Can't Wait, are mid-80s synthesizer pop-rock. She sings energetically but the stuff sounds very dated now. The only song I really liked on this one was ""Imperial Hotel"" - a spirited rocker with full band (several of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers), sounds great, including Stevie's voice. They should have done five more like that!!! ""I Sing For the Things"" is very tender and acoustic-romantic - her soft voice sounds damaged, like it's about to collapse, and yet this adds to the vulnerable feel of the song. But elsewhere, yeah, synthesizers take over, she's lost in a haze on the title track, and in general her songwriting is not strong here. 'The Nightmare' is bad, a half-incoherent train of recycled Stevie lyrics and loud chug-chug synth rock to back it up. Exception: the lovely ""Has Anyone Ever..."" but you can get that on TimeSpace and on the Box set."
3,MP3 version does not live up to the original,"I bought the MP3 version of this recording mostly due to nostalgia. I owned the tape in college and played it half to death. As others have pointed out, the songs are dated, but I knew that going into it. There are still a few really good tracks on here even if they do sound almost cliche-80s.The reason I'm giving this only three stars instead of four is that the MP3 version is just plain awful in terms of sound quality. It's tinny, unbalanced, and just plain bad. It's a shame because I know the vinyl and tape versions were not like this. And, of course, I can't return it because it's an MP3 file, and Amazon doesn't do refunds on those unless the files are corrupt or otherwise won't play. It plays fine; it just sounds bad."
5,Must have,"This is a wonderful addition to any avid fan's collection of DragonLance. I, found myself actually making the recipes, trying out the music and just having a great read over all. I found it gave additional insight into the characters and the world of Krynn. This is my second second time buying this book, lost the first one a while ago and I had to get it again."
2,Not their best,"While their singing is as precise as ever, the King's Singers probably shouldn't have chosen this group of songs. I've seen them do non-classical songs in concert and they're fabulous, but this album just doesn't really work in their style."
2,upset,paid 30+ dollars for a BENT stethoscope. the rubber tube connecting to the metal part was all bent n outta wack to the point where it dosnt sit well on the shoulders. plus it came in SLIVER and blue NOT all blue like the picture
3,Good but not great,"I bought the MDF Sprague Rappaport after the tubing of my Littmann started to disintegrate. The MDF is an acceptable stethoscope which works well. I am still getting use to some of the differences from the older Littmann. The respiratory and cardiac sounds do appear to be clearer and crisper using this stethoscope. However the volume appears to be a little decreased. I am not sure if this is due to the different ear buds than the Littmann. I used the hard/dense ear pieces in the littmann and the MDF does not have an equivalent set. However, with increasing use I have been able to get used to the decreased volume and it is only in very early pulmonary fibrosis or other diseases with subtle auscultation findings have I experienced any difficulty. I would recommend the stethoscope but not to a student. Subtle findings may be more difficult to hear."
2,IBM shouldn't have put their name on this shoddy product,"A good idea, but beyond looks, gadgets, and the ""coolness"" factor, you need to have a good basic phone. This phone does not meet that basic requirement. It's all dressed up but performance is less than expected.GOOD: - It's a cool looking phone, I admit it. The vertical cradle charger, which can be placed quite some distance from the base unit is chic and stylish.BAD: - Neither keypad nor display are backlit - Annoying echo when speaking - More static than my 900MHz PanasonicWhen it boils down to it, it's just not a good phone. I'm back to the tried and true Panasonic."
5,"Grand Prix 8"" Cooks Knife ""GREAT""!","I looked at virtually all the reviews before buying as well as checking out knife at a store in town.This is a fantastic knife but this review may be moot soon as the Grand Prix line has been replaced by the Grand Prix II line. I own a 10"" Cooks knife from the Classic Wusthof line that is roughly 20 years old and this 8"" Grand Prix knife has more weight, is better balanced and perhaps even a bit easier to keep razor sharp.I am very thrilled with the purchase and share a fantastic review for those of you who do not own this knife and have the chance to own it at $50 plus freight. A Great knife and a great deal at $85-$115 from my experience and shopping. Bon Appetit and Keep It Sharp while keeping it safe from young ones and rookies..."
5,Cook's Knife,"The knife arrived in good shape, and it is a joy to use. Pleasing to look at, well balanced, sharp. Because of a sale, I could have bought it for $5 less directly from the dealer if I had known who the dealer was. Nonetheless, I'm glad to have it and use it."
4,Product review,"A fleeting appearance of Angelina Joile, not my typical pick, bit boring well a lot boring but good quality couldn't get this DVD anywhere else"
1,PhytoMist Instant Hydrating Conditioner,"Horrible, makes you hair feel like hay. I have dyed hair, so mayb it would work better on non-dyed. Way too much money for one time use."
1,"Dead pixels, bad tuner","The tuner on my LCD is awful. White stripes going across the screen all the time. It delivers the same result using the Composite signal (A/V). Using the component (Cr, Cb, Y) gives a decent image only, but it is not HDTV, so forget about the Progressive scan DVD players. It will work as a computer monitor only if your video card detects it right, otherwise you will end up with black lateral regions without image. Not a good buy. Moreover, the company will only exchange the monitor for you if you have more than 3 dead pixels. Mine came with 4 to 6 bad pixels - lucky me! Absurd!"
2,"Sharp, but not handy","These were highly rated in Cooks Illustrated, so I bought them. Yes, they are sharp, but I really do not like the grip. They are supposed to be able to be used by right- or left-handed people, but that means that they don't work really well for either. I do not find that I can get a good grip on them and wish I had bought a traditional model of scissors."
5,Cuts almost everything,"I am enjoying these Wuesthof Kitchen Shears since a long time. They are easy to hold while I am able to cut securely almost everything. A friend once told me that she would cut the cooked spaghettis for her kids with these shears. I tried it too and found it to be fast, convenient and clean. And one afternoon I caught my husband cutting a cooked lobster shell! The shears survived well, but I bought him the Poultry Shears from Wuesthof for further lobster cutting tasks. Lobster Cayman Style, I am getting hungry!Wusthof Stainless Poultry Shears"
3,Shortchanged by 2 ounces,"I ordered the 16 oz. Tellicherry peppercorns and received 14 oz of the peppercorns. Not too big a deal, but where are the other two ounces? False advertising, shortchanged - Is this how they make their profit? Will think twice before ordering anything more from this company."
3,"Factual, not organized well or interesting.",Not near as good as the American Horticultural Society Plant Propagation Book. Lacks focus and organization. I was really hoping for something which I could use more as a resource. Very disappointed.
4,"Good book, but cover was torn","I love this book. Very useful book. However, when I received the book, I notice the cover was torn."
5,"Great for kids, students and adults","If you are a visual learner, the book is a gold mine. The illustrations, timelines are of highest quality, will help with retention and teaching. A must have in your resource collection."
4,Great resource.,"I love that this book has so much information in it. It has timelines, charts, lists, brief explanations of some Bible- time traditions. The publishers even give you permission to make a limited number of copies for your church or Bible study group. It is larger than I thought so it is awkward to carry. Also, some of the information about certain ""denominations"" is not accurate, but that is common when written by people who are not members of those groups. Overall, it is a great resource to have."
5,Lodge Crushes Le Creuset,"Just as good as Le Creuset at 1/3 the price! Why pay those rediculous high prices for a hunk of iron with a porcelain coating. Performs great - cook-top or in the oven. Even, slow braising. Perfect."
5,Great small Dutch oven,We use this oven all the time. It works very well in the oven and on top of the stove.
2,sad...,Got my dutch oven and used it twice and it already has a hairline crack on the inside. Bought it in December and cannot return now in February....... such a shame because it is so pretty.
5,well loved gift,"I bought this 6qt for my brother as a holiday gift...they got it in late dec. and have used it a few times already..they love the way it cooks/looks[color is outstanding as all the colors that I've seen of lodges cast iron]solid tool/the taste of the cooked food...I myself have 2 of the 6qt dutch ovens[red,blue] and use them some times both at the same time they are well made and very handy...things cook /taste better in cast iron..and enameling helps in so many ways in the process of cooking[types of food that you can cook] cleaning up and preserving the product..."
5,Super dutch oven,Cooked chicken to perfection - love the large size of this dutch oven. I also just made soup in it and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the soup was ready. Just bought a pot roast and am confident it will be perfect. Everyone needs this in their kitchen!
3,Made in China (and not by Lodge Mfg),"When asked where the enameled cookware is made, the company sent this:""Our enamel cookware is imported from China. We do not make the enamel cookware. We do have it 3rd party tested.""Anything made in France, even a cheaper version of Le Creuset, has to be better than relying on China's safety standards."
5,"Wonderful pot, but Lodge is no longer American Made :-(","This is a really nice pot, very heavy, nice enamel coating, beautiful shade of green. Very disappointed though to find that Lodge is now making their products in China. Thought I was ordering American made. Bummer.Update: After using this pot for a few months, I am VERY satisfied with it. It's become my first pot of choice for soups, stews and roasts. No chipping, in spite of frequent use. It looks as nice as the day I took it out of the box and cleanup is a breeze. You won't go wrong with this pot, in spite of it being made in China!"
5,"Not sure what I can add to the other ""5 Stars"", but it really is that good!","The color (I bought red) is gorgeous. (I think it even makes a nice accent piece left out on the stove.) And you simply cannot beat it for stews and soups--and it looks great for serving, as well!I also bought the casserole and am thoroughly enjoying my first foray into cast iron cooking."
4,Knob is good up to 500 degrees F,"Turns out the 3Qt Lodge Dutch Oven comes with a steel knob that is good up to 500 degrees F according to the manual that came with it. I had purchased the Le Creuset replacement steel knob thinking I needed it for high temp cooking - now I have to return the extra knob (and pay return shipping). So I hope this saves someone else from buying and returning the extra knob! I have not used the oven yet, so can't yet comment on its quality (So the 4 star rating is just for the knob working at high temps per the manual - not yet tested in real life)."
5,keeping Gene in the kitchen,I bought this Lodge enamel cast-iron 6 qt dutch oven caribbean blue along with the 3qt Island Spice for my husband. He only uses cast iron cookware. He is thrilled with the quality of these enameled pots. He looks for something to cook. He said this was a very good deal on these. pots. Thanks so much for helping me stay out of the kitchen. Betty
4,going dutch,nice heavy pot. Did lamb shanks and london broil the slow cook way and the family gave the thumbs up. came real quick just in timke for the holidays. good value I recommend it. doesn't have a metal knob is the only drawback.
1,Disappointment after a year,"I was very excited to get this pot to add to my kitchen. We eat a lot of soups and stews in the winter. It did a wonderful job and I kept it as per the directions. I always washed it by hand and used nylon utensils in it to preserve the enamel. Last week, the enamel started coming off the the sides and bottom of the pot. I was very disappointed as it was a prized kitchen item. It is back to the older pots and pans that I have. I would not recommend the purchase as it will not last very long. I guess there is a reason the other more expensive brand is so very expensive."
3,Knob on lid melted,"This is a great dutch oven, BUT if you're planning on using the lid in the oven you MUST be sure that you don't go above 400 degrees. The knob is made of a cheap plastic that cracked upon my first use (425). I'm going to have to replace this knob with something else that can withstand a hotter oven."
5,Just what I expected,"I bought this product and had it shipped to my sister's house before I took it to Thailand when I visited her (very difficult to find cast iron products here and the ones that are available are very, very expensive). The shipping was very fast, thanks to Amazon. After a long trip, it still came in perfect shape with everything in tact. I've been using it about 5 times now and so far it still performs as I had hoped. What's more, I think this enameled pot is easier to clean and to keep in this humid weather. (I bought a small skillet cast iron at the same time with this one with a lid. And although I like how the pan cooks food, I find it difficult to keep in good shape.) Anyway, I like this Lodge enameled cast iron very much and highly recommend it. You don't need to buy a very expensive enameled cast iron pot unless you want to show off. If you are just serious about cooking and want a good performance pot, this one will do a nice job !"
5,"so far, so good","I've used this only about a dozen times so far. So far, I couldn't be happier with it. It's a good looking pot with a nice fitting lid. It cooks great and clean-up is pretty easy. You can't beat it for the money. You can't help banging a pot this heavy around some even when trying to be careful, but so far no chips. The lid fits their skillet too."
4,Lodge Color Dutch Oven,"I like the nice even heat. I wish the ceramic inside did not stain so easily and after several uses will not come back to the original color. I bought three, one for me, one for each of two daughters."
1,So disappointed,"I was so happy to find these and bought two sizes. They arrived quickly and were beautiful to look at . Unfortunately, when I used one of them for the second time, it started to make a strange noise and I found that the enamel on the inside was coming off and splattered all over my stove top. I was left with ruined meat and a pot with a large piece of the enamel missing. Needless to say, I returned them. I then went out and bought a ""Chasseur""pot which was so much more expensive but in this case -you get what you pay for. By the way, Amazon were very good about my returning the pots as I had thrown out the original packaging. That is why I will continue to shop with them -great customer service."
4,Very Nice,"I purchased this dutch oven a few months ago and it's really nice. I am able to make dinner and then stick it in the oven, while I take my kids to baseball practices. I did notice recently that the enamel is starting to chip at the top near the lid, but you get what you pay for. I could not afford a 400.00 French dutch oven, so I settled for this. In all, it's really nice and a pretty blue color. I will probably buy another one in emerald (if I don't win the lotto)."
2,Not quite what I was hoping for,This is my first dutch oven. The enamel didn't hold up very well. After about 3 uses food started to stick to the bottom. And I'm not talking about the nice brown bits you look for to deglaze. Food just sticks and in turn burns while you are cooking. I was careful about cleaning and followed instructions as to not damage the enamel while washing so I don't think that is it.
5,Great Pot,"I got this pot for 2 reasons, to make fried chicken and for great big batches of chili. This pot is great, it holds the temperature of the frying oil at a steady temperature and its so big you can fry a 4.5 pound chicken all at once. I noticed some reviewers complained about the weight, curious, you expect cast iron to be light? I've only had the pot for about 3 weeks so I can't comment on the durability of the enamel coating. One other reviewer complained about the lid not fitting, perhaps he got a lemon, my lid fits perfectly."
5,"Good quality, very good value","We've used this for all sorts of cooking for about a year- from browning and searing to stews and sauces. The finish seems very high quality. We did read the instructions on care and cleaning (no metal utensils scraping the surface), and so far, so good."
5,6 QUART DUTCH OVEN,I LOVE this dutch oven! I can't believe I waited so long to buy one. It takes less to bring it up to temperature and maintains the heat level perfectly. I cook a lot and use thermometers.
4,nice,"Holy smokes, it's heavy! I only use this about once a month. I've been pleased with all that's been cooked in it. Though I don't notice much of an advantage over what I typically use to cook with."
4,Lovely,"I've only owned this pot for a few months, and use it on a weekly basis. I've only used it on stovetop so far, and everything I have cooked in it has turned out beautiful and tasteful. The pot gets up to high heat quickly, and often I just cover and simmer on low or no heat. Meats are tender and juicy and vegetables taste magnificent. Very pleased with this purchase."
5,Dutch oven,Love it!! Made a lamb stew and this product was so easy to use and held lots of food - works great in the oven too.
4,Great buy,Delivery was quick. It's very beautiful actually. The slight curved bottom hasn't been a issue. The lid handle is metal. It's cleaned up well. Terrific bargain.
5,The best cast iron cookware,We have tried other cast iron and enameled cast iron dutch ovens But Lodge is the best quality and the best buy of any. We won't buy any brand but Lodge from now on.
4,Great product,"Love this dutch oven, just wish I knew the handle was only safe to 400* when I bought it. Nothing hard to fix - just buy a new handle."
3,Sadly Disappointed,"Prior to purchasing this item I went to the Lodge website to research the product as the Amazon information on it is quite sparse. The Lodge site is very informative on the construction of their cast-iron product line. They even proffered that the paint used on their enameled products was imported from France, begging a comparison with Le Crueset, of course. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the Dutch Oven had actually been manufactured in CHINA. I feel that Lodge is somewhat disingenuous in their promotion of the enameled product line by not stating that they do not make these products here in the U.S. (Amazon shares some blame here also) The Dutch Oven is an attractive piece of cookware, but concerns about what additives the Chinese may use in the painting process exist. I would like to see an independent labratory analysis of this cookware to prove that the enameling process is lead-free."
1,Disappointing,"I was pleased to receive my Lodge Dutch Oven yesterday.....until I opened the box and found that it was made in China! Lodge Manufacturing, on their masthead, claims to have made ""America's Original Cookware"". I guess that is in the past!I am a proud American; I believe China is our enemy. I have already returned the Dutch Oven and will search for one not made in China.I do believe that the country or origin should be clearly indicated in the Amazon ads."
5,"Loodge Color Dutch Oven Spice Red, 6-quart","It is a convenient size, vary good looking, heavy duty (not flimsy). I did think it was pretty expensive but it was a gift for my daughter and hopefully will serve her well for years to come."
5,a great choice,"I had been wanting a Le Creuset cast iron dutch oven for a long time, but the price just kept stopping me. When I saw this Lodge Cast-Iron dutch oven, in a lovely blue that would complement my new kitchen, I decided to give up my dreams of a Le Creuset and buy this. Guess what--I don't think that the Le Creuset could be any better than this. It is beautiful, it does everything I wanted it to do, and at this price I was able to buy a cookbook that I've been wanting, as well! I've been very happy with my purchase."
1,Cracked enamel,"I recently purchased a Lodge Dutch Oven with a gift certificate for my wedding. I expected it to last for years but, within 5 months, it was cracked on the food surface and had to be thrown in the trash."
1,"Mine Chipped badly, and I returned it (unfortunately!)","Sorry, I had to return this item as it chipped quite badly, and the flakes broke into the food that was cooking..."
5,Lodge Dutch Oven,"I really love my new dutch oven, it's nice to look at and it does such a fantastic job of distributing the heat evenly. This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
4,Love it!,I love this pot. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is b/c it's soooo heavy and the knob gets hot even on the stove top. It's a beautiful red color. I cook everything in this pot. I bought Lodge b/c it was the same as the more expensive ones and was less than half the price. For this price I was able to get a bigger one.
5,Worked great,"Browns well, easy clean up, very even heat. This thing is a tank though, so not for the weak armed. It is Chinese made (what isn't these days) but the workmanship seems very good. Nice color. That is a plastic handle on the lid, although they say it is oven safe to 400 degrees. The lid also fits the matching skillet.Lodge Enamel on Cast Iron 11 Inch Skillet, Caribbean BlueOverall I'd rate this a bargain, especially stacked up against other enamel on cast iron cookware. Use the ""supersaver shipping"". Slow but it will save you $15."
4,Mature and Good,"I fell in love with NFG when they still had an ""A"" at the start of their name. Sticks and Stones and Catalyst were two albums that basically had the band stuck in stand by me. I was skeptical to buy Coming Home, but i'm glad I did. NFG are a more mature sounding band in terms of lyrics and they way they play. I wouldn't call these songs ballads at all. This album is step in the right direction for a great band. I tip my hat to NFG for moving forward and not regergitating another album that sounds exactly like the last two. Buy it and you will relate and love it!"
2,Maybe it will grow on me... but I doubt it,"There's nothing here but a departure to a crappy emo/pop sound including handclaps and other various misplaced garbage. A few catchy riffs don't make up for the lack of quality or energy of previous NFG releases. I guess a lot of great bands put out a turd of a CD once or twice and on this one, NFG dropped a stinker."
2,Sell Outs???,"I was a big NFG fan. I couldn't wait for their new album. Now that I've listened to it, I was very dissapoited that their new songs are very pop-like. Musically it's slow. The lyrics are just okay. I wouldn't recomend ""Coming Home"" for the real NFG fan. If you think that this one of their best albums, then you have really never listened to Nothing Gold Can Stay, Catalyst, Sticks and Stones, and the self-titled Cd.Dissapointed New Found Glory fan.I hope that the next cd will be the type of music that THEY want to play."
4,Bayco SL-800 cord reel,"Good heavy duty construction, easy to install, strong return spring, good appearance. The only negative (in my opinion), is the red LED that indicates power is on, uses energy constantly."
5,A new fan from Australia,"Linda Back McKay's wildly beautiful poems address not only the lyrical moments in life, but also the soul searing life events that leave one forever changed. Her fearless and honest appraisal of a deeply textured life, produces profound insights, beautifully crafted by this skilled wordsmith. Her prose expresses vivid emotions, along with gentle, loving observations to make this collection, ""Ride the Full Tilt Boogie"" a wonderful ride indeed."
2,Pen or writing implement?,"Why does he use all these unnecessary, fancy, confusing, mind bending words? The author loses and confuses the reader."
2,No Color,"If I had realized the pictures in the softcover book were black and white, I would never have purchased it."
3,Could Not Hold My Daughter's Interest,"My daughter (17 months) really loves Elmo's World. So we bought more Seasame Street Dvds hoping she would enjoy them. Unfortunely, this one didn't capture her interest. This might be better for an older child who is interested in learning about other cultures."
4,They're great - he loved them,"They are wonderful - he said it just takes a while to break them in to your own specific feet. They hurt the first few days, but loves them now. They were a gift to my son."
5,Want some comfort,"once you break them in they're super comfortable. really great sandal! I have a size 12 foot, and that's what I ordered but I should have gotten a 12.5 or 13. So that's the only thing I would do differently. So order a little larger then you normally get."
3,Rainbow,Loved my old pair of Rainbows. No brainer buying these. Not the best pair I've ever warn. Leather is stiff out of the box. Designed fairly narrow for me. My wide feet took a bit longer to get that perfect fit.
1,Absolutely do not fit a wide foot,"HEre's the thing....everyone says these sandals need a ""break-in"" period --- a) that's ridiculous, and b) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot (E, EEE, or EEEEE). These are soft leather, nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable. I wear a 7.5 EEE. I ordered one size larger (8.5 - 9.5 MEdium) and they absolutely DO NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap, they cut into the skin between the toes, and there is absolutely no way to ""break in"" the sandle....I wore them for about an hour and found that a) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot and created bloody welts. These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn, and they have dirt on them, and they have blood on the straps.$50.00 worth of garbage within one hour. DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say ""just break them in""....they do not fit a wide foot, period. Save your money."
1,For skinny feet,I have wide feet and they Rainbow does not make a single size that my size 12 feet can slip into.
1,Fake sandals,"Beside from being the wrong color, the sandals I got were fake... not real Rainbow flip-flops... couldnt ask for an exchange because Im currently outside the US, and it would take too much time and effort (and of course, money) to send them back. Be aware, looks can be deceiving (specially with the pictures they show you)."
4,Green Rainbow Sandal Review,"they're high quality, just a little bigger than i was expecting. obviously rainbows are great and the warranty is unbelievable. they always look good"
1,Think twice before buying Wusthof over Henckels & Forschner,I have owned Henckels knives for years and when they get dull they are very easy to sharpen to a razor sharp edge by one's self. But with Wusthof knives I never seem to be able to get them as sharp like a Henckels Knife(and plus the factory edge on Henckels is much sharper than Wusthof). I would definite think twice about about how easy it is to sharpen a knife before buying it and Wusthof is very difficult while Henckels and Forschner are very very easy.
5,Great UK mix,All the great stuff from 99 - combine it with V.1 and you've got all the hot stuff for 99.
5,Non stick wonder,"Since going completely vegan and using no free fats, my bread wasn't coming out of my regular bread pans. It really was messy and I was very frustrated until I remembered seeing silicone baking pans at Costco. I looked and found them at Amazon and ordered six pans. The first time I tried them I had them separately placed in the oven as normal but because they aren't as sturdy, the sides bulged out. Now I place them with sides touching each other for support and they work great. The bread comes out easily and I'm happy again! And the whole wheat bread is just delicious!"
2,"noisy, had to return it",bought this because my old filter was too loud and this new one was louder. I called and got a replacement empeller under warranty and installed the new part and that did not help. Was able to return and get a full refund which was good.
2,EMPEROR 400,NOISY - Apparently a faulty impeller. Customer Service for this product offered a new impeller it never arrived.The seller offered an excellent service but the product is of low quality.
3,Emperor 400,I read many reviews before buying this filter and decided to get it because others were too expensive for my budget. This filter does it's job cleaning and you have to clean the water filter tubes at least 1 a month for best operation.Now the cons of this filter: The two flat water tubes that bring the filtered water back into the tank are too short causing an annoying loud water noise only after an inch of water is gone. I still like the filter but something to consider between water chnages of your tank.
5,Love them!,I use these in all my aquariums. They run great. They aren't super pricy. They last a long time. Worth your money!
5,Great filter,This is a great filter. I have a 55gal. aquarium and it does the job beautifully with minimal cleaning. It primes quickly and the filters can be washed and reused.
3,Not terribly bad but not all that great,"Pros-has a biowheel, not just a filter cartridge, so something extraCons-very time you remove a filtere cartridge you lose alot of bacteria, even thought there are some on the wheel-very very terribly loud, I can here it a criss the house and it is installed properly-biowheels may stop and you lose bacteria-overpricedIf you get this filter, stuff it with polyfiber/sponges and biomax or seachem matrixI recommend aqua clears. But they are overrated. An Aquaclear 20 is good for up to 10 gallons, an aqua clear 30 for up to 15g an aqua clear 50 for up to a 25g, and an aqua clear 70 for up to 35 gallons, and so on. However some cases are different. You are filtering up after your fish's bioload, NOT the tank. 1 neon tetra in a 1,000g tank may not need a filter, just the surface agitated. But in a 1 gallon tank(I suggest against this) they need extreme filtration"
1,Noisy,Well I can't say much about performance so far. What I know out of the box it is noise. Nope it is not splashing water as I filled that up. Problem is the actual pump is noise. We see what happens after a return if the second one will be the same. Reading other reviews I am skeptical if I should get the same one again.
3,Good filter - too noisy,"Bought the filter, it meets it lives up to it's billing HOWEVER it's TOO NOISY. I have an Eheim ProII under my tank and thought I'd add some biowheel action to off-set the closed system I was running. Filter introduced something into my room that I had not had before, noise. Marineland kindly sent me a new propeller unit but it didn't matter. Housing has no sound proofing and makes more noise than I had wanted or hoped for."
5,The Best Filter System,"After my last filter system stopped working I looked around to see what was available. I have a small tank (50 gallon) but wanted a filter system that will keep the water nice and clean. I purchased thePenguin Power Filter, 350 GPHand I'm so glad I did. With just the 2 size C filters it cleared up the water in just 1 hr and you can add 2 more size C filters (total of 4 filters) if you need to. I read several reviews about how loud it is but the one I have is very quiet (I do have a canopy covering it so that might be the reason why it's not very loud). Also I received a $10 mail in rebate with the system so with that in mind this is one of the cheapest 350 GPH filter systems on the market. I highly recommend this system."
2,200B penguin biowheel filter,"I've only had this a few weeks and it is making a terrible noise. I am going to contact the company, but am not happy it is doing this after such a short time using it."
4,Not for use in Turtle Tanks w/o Cut Away Sides,"So, everyone has been raving about this filter, and it's really a breeze to set up, the customer service is great (5 min or less on hold to speak with a real human even during business hours) and I love the extra baskets for media. The only problem is that it cannot pump water more than 2 inches above the water line. I recently inheretied a RES turtle and got a second hand fish tank with full height sides. The water flow is just a trickle since it has to pump over 4 inches to get to the filter. I've got to switch to a canister, so turtle lovers beware.FYI, don't buy the replacement filters; when you get the system, order two more of the media baskets through replacement parts and make your own. The filters that come with it are just floss and activated carbon."
1,NOISY - is this thing diesel-powered?,"I have never heard a more noisy filter. In the roughly one year since I bought it new, I've observed that it has basically has 2 impeller modes - noisy and more noisy. For no apparent reason it just kicks up the volume at random times, often during my favorite TV shows. I'll never buy another filter made by these folks."
4,Horror 24/7,"This double feature was a treat to find. The original feature (The Curse) was directed by a popular actor which was interesting, but the story was really good. Special effects were not the greatest, but that would be the only weakness of the film. ""The Curse 2 (The Bite)"" had an interesting plot, but the acting suffered. It is still worth watching as it is a good film. The cost for the double feature is unbeatable."
5,Everyone needs this book,"Mr. Exley shows us the importance of living a balanced life. So often we feel guilty if we are not pushing ourselves beyond our limits. He points out that being a driven person has become a badge of honor in our society. But the end results are devistating. This book helped me to see that it is okay to relax and enjoy life, that God wants us to. If you really want to be free, read this book."
5,Complete and Detailed,"This book is a must have in addition with the Chadabe's Electric Sound, and Holmes's Electronic and Experimental Music. Manning gets more specific about the qualities and characteristics of electronic music. A must have for those actively involved in the production, recording, technical, compositional, or performance aspects of computer music."
5,Memories,This book has brought back memories of long ago. It reminds me that the time of our youth is never forgotten and to be able to feel it again like that is a gift from the author. Thanks for the memories.Left high shool long ago.
3,Cinderella and other stories,"I found this book a bit boring at time but overall I found it was a good read, and well written"
5,Fantastic Fantasy,"Fantastic plot. Really gets you into the scheming of the characters. I found myself figuring out different angles of the plot even when I wasn't reading. The ending was great, but could've used an epilogue.I would highly suggest this to anyone who likes fantasy. Even to those who don't."
3,Unsure,"I wasn't sure what to rate this book. I absolutely loved the first half of the series but I could have done without the second part. I found the first 5 books to be a light read that moved fairly quickly, and I would recommend it to anyone! The last 5 books felt unfinished and just not as well thought out with too many things left unanswered. It almost seemed like he was tired of writing and just decided to wrap it up.The first half gets 5 out of 5. The second only gets a 2. So since I can't give 3.5 stars, I'm going with 3. I would still recommend buying the book, because it's a great deal! You'll love the first half and rush right into the second but by the end, will probably be left wishing for something better.I'll continue to reread the first 5 books as often as I can!"
3,Can be heavy going,"First, my positives: the ideas are very creative, the voice is interesting, and the plot can be suspenseful.That said, I usually read about a thousand pages a week, and this edition of about 1200 pages has taken weeks. This read often becomes like trying to penetrate the ""Third Veil"". Zelazny relates the tales from the first person perspective of two characters (Corwin in books 1-5, and Merlin in 6-10). This can explain the thinness of the portrayal of the other characters but doesn't really excuse it. Some of the writing devices are downright tedious. You may also note numerous editing failures throughout.Nevertheless, this is a classic (albeit dated) and would read better piecemeal, one novella of about one hundred pages followed by another author and work, returning later for the next installment."
4,A must for all Sci Fi fans,"This is one of the all time classic sci fi series! The Corwin books absolutely rock! He's an interesting charachter, and the plot twists are great. These books were written in the 70's and much of the slang is very dated, but that adds to the charm of it. If you have trouble keeping all of the siblings straight (I did) pick up the Amber Castel guide as a referance tool.The Merlin books are good, but could have been a few hundred pages shorter. The Corwin saga built towards the finale in Courts of Chaos, but the next 5 books just kind of myandered along. Merlin was a cool charachter, and the stories were decent, but they paled in comparrison to the Corwin books.This was ground breaking stuff and it's had tremendous impact on the sci fi world."
4,The GREAT Book of Amber is...GREAT!,"I had read the first five books in the series as a teenager about 10 years ago...I was happy to find that I enjoyed it even more as a 'grown up'! Roger Zelazny's style is exciting and fast paced and this series is some of the best fantasy fiction I have read. Reading the second half of the series for the first time, you can notice the transition from Roger Zelazny to the new authors ('The Amber Corporation') but they try to capture his style and they do a pretty good job. Overall, the whole story is so complex, exciting and well written it's hard to stop reading! Also, buying it in this large volume with all 10 books makes it so much easier reading, as in the single editions it's not very clear which order the books are in. Also very good value!"
1,It doesn't end,I apparently have to disagree with most of the folks here. I just had to finish it to prove something to myself.. and I proved I was an idiot. I found the concept somewhat interesting.. but never felt like the main character was really in any danger.. whenever he was.. poof.. magic.. he was free and on his way. The stories.. 1-10.. were the same concept done again and again. In the end.. I didn't care about much.. just how many pages I had left before I could put it away.
5,Perhaps the most stunningly original story ever written,This story begins in our world and moves in and out of it smoothly. The characters are wholly believable and while the overall plotline may seem familiar the execution of that plot is spectacular and the premise is like nothing you've ever conceived.
3,It's okay...,"It's not as informative as it could be. In fact, you're probably better off doing a couple of Google searches for 'reiki' than you would be buying this book, unless you were looking for an outline of the discipline. For what it is, it's not bad."
4,very good healing book,"I had bought this book and I really enjoyed it, it points out where you are suffering and having a area where you are held back.. It healed me and every time I had my sad, down moment I would go to my book and just read a little and pray. It helped and I would say its a nice book."
5,Great product!!,"I have never had problems with blisters using regular socks when running 5 miles. When I decided to train to run my first 1/2 marathon, I started getting blisters on my 8th mile. I purchased my first pair of these at a running shoe store and no longer get blisters on my feet. I have since purchased more through amazon."
5,Write Socks Kick Butt!!,"Double layered Wright socks are the only socks I wear for sports anymore.Running, sailing, basketball whatever...Comfy, never stretch out, double layer prevents blisters...Only complaint is the dirt on the Kalalau trail in Hawaii stained them orangish.... but I still wear them.BTW I have many pairs and they get soaked in the ocean, run in long distances etc... NEVER has a hole or tear in any pair!I have blown through many other socks in the same time."
2,Disappointed,"First of all the movie was great! I would recommend buying it (the movie that is). It brought back a lot of memories on how hanging out use to be.You would think that ""Movie Soundtrack"" would actually include what you heard from the movie. Well, I was totally disappointed because they only had 6 out of 12 songs as original songs played and the rest remakes.Hopefully they will put out another collection for the ""Movie Soundtrack"" with all original songs. If they every listen to music reviews."
2,CAN THE REAL ARTIST PLEASE STAND UP,Man I am still an avid skater and love the old skate music. I mean I can get down with The Elements new joint I am loving that Pure Gold and always been a fan of Kool and the Gang even Jamriquo and Le Chic other than that this is GARBINO' aka GARBAGE!Not saying they are not good artists in their own write just not classic stuff. I am tired of Beyonce messing up classical songs she needs to stick to her teeny bopper music or come again with a mature angle!Sorry!
2,Roll Bounce,"Did not like it, was not what I expected, I thought they were going to be the orginal artist on this soundtrack."
3,He's got the whole world... upside down!,"Dear Frank Tipler. In case you don't know, it was God who created the Universe, and not the other way around.He is the Alpha and Omega points. He is not a creation of nature. He is the Creator of nature. Nature is the Beta point. Are you intelligent and wise enough to get that?Once you understand this simple truth, everything will start to fit in and feel right, and it will help a lot to clear up your helplessly confused and senseless thoughts and speculations. Right now you have it upside down. You have to change your assumptions and renew your mind, as the Apostle Paul has put it.You see, once your starting assumptions are wrong, the brighter you are the worse is the trouble your reasoning gets you in.By the way, the thousands of anthropic coincidences that can be found in the macro and micro spheres of the Universe are exactly what biblical creationism would predict."
5,One of the best live albums you've never heard,"Probably not many people outside of Australia have even heard of this band, much less gone to the trouble of tracking the LP version (formerly the only version) down (in Australia). But, if you have, as I did, it's worth the trouble. BOW RIVER is flat out one of the best live rock songs you'll ever hear. And BARKING SPIDERS is one of the hardest rocking, tightest-sounding sets you'll ever come across. Stop reading this and buy this now."
4,"maybe 3.6 stars, maybe 3.8 stars","I'm a big fan of power/melodic metal bands like Accept, Iron Maiden, In Flames, Dio, Loudness, Raven, Saxon, etc., and I bought this because I had heard much praise of Manowar. However, I was disappointed by this album. Apart from the solos, the guitar playing on this album is fairly simplistic compared to those bands. This album sounds similar to Saxon, but IMO lacks the utter forcefulness of that band's music. The production on this album wasn't very good either, it's very clear-sounding, but it lacks the intensity of the best power/melodic metal albums such as Raven's ""All For One"", Accept's ""Restless & Wild"", Krokus' ""One Vice at a Time"", & In Flames' ""Clayman"". I would bet that Manowar's early albums are much better than this though, and probably the newer albums also, so I haven't given up on the band yet. The best song on this album is probably either ""Violence & Bloodshed"" or ""Defender""."
3,"A Toned Down Version of ""Manowar""","This is a lighter, more mainstream sound than all theirother albums and also one of my least favorites. Was this anattempt at commercialism? I really don't think so! With asong like ""Blow Your Speakers"" one might think so, which bythe way I think is the poorest song they have recorded to date.This album does have a lot of great songs on it though! Songslike ""Fighting the World"", ""Carry On"", and ""Defender"" reallyhave a lot of emotion behind them. Erics' voice sounds superbon this one! But this album just doesn't have that raw feel toit, that is so typical of the ""Manowar"" sound. It's funny howpeople judge ""Manowars"" music on the basis of image! What doesthe image have to do with the music? Nothing, they are not relative to eachother! They're not trying to sell you theirclothes, just true heartfelt, spiritual music! Take it or Leaveit!!"
3,Manowar - The Best Band In The World !,"We are who refuse to take part in modern mediocrity, will forever stand alone an outcast..."
3,An unfortunate product of the times,"""Fighting the World"" was released when the music world was infested with the big hair/ glam rockers and unfortunately, Manowar was not immune to the phenomena. While this is hands-down Manowar's worst album, it also proves something else: Even at their worst, the Kings of Metal are greater than many other bands at their best!This album contains a lot of downers, like Manowar's worst-ever song, ""Blow Your Speakers,"" and ""Fighting the World"" which isn't too much better. Both are gilded glam rock songs.Other songs like ""Violence and Bloodshed"" and ""Defender,"" featuring Olson Welles, weren't as good as they could have been, but weren't too bad.However, even then, Manowar can produce good songs to save themselves, like ""Black Wind, Fire and Steel"" and ""Holy War,"" both which personify the spirit of Manowar.Yes, even Manowar can make mistakes, but then again, a screw-up by Manowar exceeds victories of others!"
2,too bulky for my son,Bought these gloves as a gift for my son. Ended up returning them because he found they were too thick to grasp anything properly. Note that I own a different model of Schiek gloves and have been very happy with them.
2,Too bulky and tight,"I bought these because the fins gave me the impression that they were well designed. Unfortunately they arrived too small and too bulky. I'm sure my hands would have sweat in these, and they would have negatively affected the grip and feel of the bar."
1,Not as good as the hype,"After a friend of mine recommended these gloves to me I went ahead and bought them after wearing Harbinger gloves ever since I started working out. As the review stated below these are very bulky, stiff (took about 2-3 weeks to break these gloves in lifting 5 days a week), developed a bad odor after just a month of using them, and now need to be washed every couple weeks to prevent the odor from getting out of hand, along with the stitching on one of the thumbs coming apart after a few months. Look's like I will be taking advantage of the warranty and probably selling the new pair. That's how awful I think these gloves are and definitely do NOT understand all the stellar reviews."
2,Bubbles and glare,"I bought this to replace my scratched Lexerd TrueVue Anti-Glare cover on my Garmin Zumo 660 GPS in the hopes that it would truly be ""anti-glare"", but it's the same as the Lexerd in that respect. It has exactly the same glare as the OEM screen on the GPS. Unfortunately it is not a bubble free product like the Lexerd and no matter how many times I try I can not get all the bubbles out. Yes I followed the directions to the letter. Next time I need a new screen protector I'll go back to the Lexerd TrueVue Anti-Glare."
2,Not so quite...catchy?,"Im kinda surprised of the excellent review this CD got. Im my opinion this is not the gipsy kings i know. I found it average at best. I did not find the songs as interesting as many of their other CDs. I can only recommend this to hardcore fans only. For the more timid or newcomer to this music I have to recommend the Gipsy kings CD ""ALLEGRIA"" which has to be one of the best CDs ever made anywhere. But I have to advise most to stay away from this one..."
3,Naughty and Nice,"Interesting movies from almost a century ago. But be warned. The muscial score leaves much to be desired. I prefer to turn off the sound and watch this DVD without sound, or I choose to play my own Christmas music selections in the background.Nice movies. Naughty score!"
1,I'm not going to tell you wrong.,"If you listen to one review on here, listen to this one. What is one of the major reasons you like X-Men? (Besides the characters)You like the action. This book is a X-Men book alright, minus the action. Nobody fights. I think Storm made a little cloud because she was angry, and that's IT!! Maybe it's me, but I thought this was Prisoner X, a X-Men novel, not the Daily Prison Review. Anyway it goes, do not get this one if you're looking for a real X-Men book. It was just to' up."
1,They do not work!,"After returning the first set, the second set arrived and they too do not work. This product is terrible. Don't waste your time!"
2,Earth Girls aint easy ....,"The story lacks sophisticated humor. Ofcourse, it makes you laugh but then you feel, Gosh !!! why are today's comedy films more of bathroom humor and not an intellectual entertainment. The musical goof is bound to make some feel embarressed. The DVD is well made, lots of extras."
3,antiquated,"This is a nice book. It presents all the things you would need to make a conservative investment in the 1980's. If you are interested in looking at what securities are paying out in interest in today's economy, five minutes on the U.S. treasuries website will tell you why you will not be interested in reading this book today."
4,Its pretty good!!,"Very good solid story, plot is good, acting is solid, Nick does a great job as usual. The film itself is not a huge budget movie, otherwise this should have went to theaters. Some scenes slightly predictable but thats ok, its a great story, plenty of action. Not Nicks best but certainly not his worst."
3,Average & Predictable,"I wasn't expecting too much, but occasionally Nic Cage surprises me like in The Weather Man - not this time. The movie was okay though, good enough for me to get to the end credits. If you like Nic Cage than it's probably worth watching, otherwise you probably won't like it. The plot and the cast just don't mend well, there's definitely something missing in this movie."
4,One of Cages best in a long time,"One of Cages best in a long time.Should have done better since it is an interesting ""what would you do in this situation"" type movie."
3,You should have a software developer,I have a same problem with VDR D220. I contacted Panasonic support and they said that I must have a software Ulead to develope its file in order to play on a computer. Then you can burn files or clip to DVD disc to play as normal. Ulead software does not come with the package. You have to buy seperately.
4,It's the Real Thing,"If you just got back from your cousin's wedding and you want to remember the whole experience, complete with music, dancing, noshing, drinking, Aunt Simi's wig slipping to one side and Uncle Moishe talking too loud and too long -- this is the album to get. Two CDs pack in a lot of music! This isn't the Hollywood version of Jewish wedding music. This is the real thing, with 'Od Yeshama', 'Yasis Alayich', and other traditional songs. Also the haunting melodies of 'Yadid Nefesh' and 'Erev Shel Shoshanim'. (OK, so they did include ""Sunrise, Sunset"" but I can forgive them that, considering everything else that is in there.)There is some repetition of songs, as it's set up to follow the progress of the wedding, from Bedekin to Chupah to the dinner and dancing. But this helps the sense of reliving the event. On a few songs the vocals and sound quality are weak ('Ketzad Merakdim' is one), but most of the music comes through with energy and passion."
3,"Not so ""complete"" not so ""science"".","Basically he's just talking about what his life was during this phase. It's a short book that just goes on and on like that. The title is all wrong. There is no ""complete science of wrestling"". The only real moves he talks about is1) When you've got the guy in the clinch spread your legs as far as possible so he won't shoot for your legs.2)Some move called the ""double chancery"" or something (I think it's on youtube) he says it really tires a guy out.There's no real advice on how to wrestle a guy who's bigger or stronger than you.The best advice in here is **** Look into Greco Roman wrestling, look into Jiu Jitsu.The book really was written about 100 years ago. This isn't like a Wrestling Encyclopedia or something. The hype was fun though, I'd recomend finding it at a library or something."
3,OK,"Not a great recording but it was the only recording I could find of Marais' ""The Bells of St. Genevieve"" that at least passed muster."
4,A talking dictionary for Russian/English that's Super!,"It's too bad that Transparent Language discontinued the WordAce series; especially, the Russian. It was compatible with their other Russian language learning programs and provided a good simulation of what Russian words sound like."
2,Disappointment,"A pain to get these on the ear, and then a pain to wear. After about ten minutes of use, I was sore. The sound quality is not much better. When indoors, they sound great, but when outside, ambient noise overwhelms them.Previous to these I owned a pair of Sony ear-clip headphones that are just as inexpensive, but of much better quality. I bought these because I lost the Sony pair and wanted to try something new. After less than a week, I promptly returned these and just bought a replacement pair of the Sony earphones. I was happy to have them back."
1,Small watchband,I was surprised to find out how small the watchband was when it arrived in the mail. I don't have a large wrist at all and it just fits.
5,ESSENTIAL 80'S MUST HAVE MUSIC,"This album is a must have for the 80's child. Every song on this album is pure magic. Granted there are only 8 tracks on this album, the quality makes up for it.Listening to this album brings me back to my early years. It's still relevant with todays dance music.I'd have to say my favorite song is Hooked On You. I just loved the synthasized beat to it. When I listen to this album, I can not sit still!It may be from the 80's, but it's deffinately worth having it in your music collection."
4,A Readable Explanation of Multiple Universes!,"The author explains what multiple universes and reality are--the author uses conversational language! He tells us lay folk what it all means and how inexplicable things like magic and miracles may happen. The author gives you a balanced view of the theory, how it began, and why--all in less than 50 pages! This book does not deny the presence of God--in fact does the opposite. You need a basic knowledge of physics and quantum mechanics to read."
1,"The Universe and Multiple Reality, by M R Franks","It deseves one star, at the most, compared to other books published on the same subject."
4,About the music,"This cd is awesome. When I'm upset or just trying to forget about the day, I get in my car and put the cd in. Instantly I smile. This is great therapy, and cheap too. Thanks!"
1,Truth in advertising,"I received the parts as advertised. Powersport Superstore and Amazon . com have not let me down. Always prompt, always get exactly what I order.Vance & Hines. They offer some of the finest LOOKING exhaust systems. And they have been in buisness for quite a few years.This is what brings me to my point, V&H; have been in the game long enough to know the difference between QUIET and LOUD, UNLESS they have all gone deaf from the error of their ways.TO CALL THESE BAFFLES QUIET or even use the word QUIET in the description has to be in violation of some Fedral Law. Times must be bad and sad for a Co. to have to resort to deception to get sales.If you live and ride somewhere that is enforcing noise Ordinance, DON'T BUY THESE, they are LOUD!!!. They will get you cited. And they make a HARLEY SOUND LIKE a Metric bike at 60, BLAT BLAT BLAT, idle sound, Deep but LOUD."
3,Too big for lady fingers,"This might be good for a large man fingers or toes but not for smaller, lady fingers. The diameter of the ring hole is 13mm. it just did not provide enough pressure. Otherwise good quality."
3,it's okay,"For the price one can't beat it, but I wouldn't say it works well... it's okay and distracts more or less. I've had numb fingers for 4 months now and I thought it would give me some relief, but it doesn't."
5,Best Rock Album in years,"Im a fan of the good old rock like acdc led zepplin motley crue and guns and roses. There have been 2 good rock albums in the last few years thornleys come again and nickelbacks the long road. they are both great albums. The album come again is the first of Ian Thornleys new project it is an awesome debut with steller songs like so far so good come again falling to pieces and clever, there is not 1 poor song on this album and i would reccomend it to everyone who finds todays music boring and lacking passion."
5,highly recommended,"I highly recommend everyone buy this CD! I can't express enough how good it is! The lyrics, singer Ian Thornley's voice and guitar playing, along with the drumming, bass, and back up vocals, are all excellent! I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it and I won't stop until they put out something new either! Anyone who was/is a fan of Big Wreck will not be disappointed with Ian's new effort! He is still a multi- talented artist joined by, although different, equally talented musicians who, together, make unforgettable music! They are truly in a class of their own! Buy their CD-you won't regret it!"
2,A couple good songs but overall disappointing,"I bought this cd with the hopes of satisfying my desire for some good, fresh rock tunes that could tide me over until the 12 Stones album ""Potter's Field"" comes out in late August.While there are a couple good songs on here; ""Falling to Pieces"", ""So Far So Good"", and ""Easy Comes"" being them. The rest of the songs are rather uneventful and mundane. However, those three good songs aren't amazing enough to pick the rest of the album up to a higher level.This band is just missing something. They don't have their own sound or style to their music and it unfortunately makes them just ordinary.Ironically, buying this cd had the opposite effect that I was looking for, in that it increased my anticipation of the release of ""Potter's Field"" instead of dulling it."
3,A heart broken Big Wreck fan.,Ian Thornley is the former lead singer of the most underrated band of all time Big Wreck. I've been waitng a long time for this CD. It's nothing special. He's gone from being underrated to overrated. If you were a fan of Big Wreck you might end up picking it up out of nostalgia just as I did. You'll listen to it for a week or so and then get bored of it. It's a Chad Kroeger produced waste of time and talent. Most of the songs are eithor very simular to each other or very simular to the Nickleback sound.I give it three stars cause it has about three quality songs on it.
5,Love It!!!!!!,They are so handy when cooking or baking! So glad I ordered. This would make a great gift. Thank you
1,"TERRIBLE-- Thin, cheap and does not stick to wall","I bought two 4-packs of these at Walmart to line a wall. By the following morning, ALL BUT ONE panel was ON THE GROUND. The adhesive tabs that come in these packages do stick to the wall, but not the crumbly cork board surface, so you are left with fallen panels (broken or cracked from hitting the ground) and adhesive squares stuck to the walls... and I mean STUCK. If I was going to rehang the cork (which I can't because all but two boards are now broken), I'd use some other type of adhesive to adhere to the wall. Oh, and note that these are quite thin, so you can't use regular push pins or you will go right into the wall. While these were relatively expensive, they are still a complete waste of $$."
5,Blue,It is blue. It rolls up well. It is silicone. It is a good size.It does all I need it to do.Is it great?I haven't any other to compare it to.Does it do what I want it to?Yep.Would I buy another if this one died?Yep.
5,Must Have Item for Bakers,"I worked several food service jobs and got used to using Silipat silicone cookie sheet mats. This Wilton Easy Flex mat is cheaper and wonderful as both a cookie sheet liner and a dough mat for those pie crusts/cut-out-cookies. I haven't needed to use any cooking spray on these mats. I did notice some dark spots on the one mat after I burned a batch of cookies, but that hasn't effected the performance any. I purchased this specific Wilton mat for a bridal gift."
2,Eh.,"I was intrigued by the title. Who doesn't want to learn the secrets of how to appear as sleek and sophisticated as a Parisian? Unfortunately, reading this book, I've developed disdain for French culture. According to the author, French women only care about looking good and getting sex from anybody anytime. This book is not worth your time; watch an Audrey Hepburn movie instead."
2,Impossibly French takes a Turn,"""All You Need To Be Impossibly French,"" takes a sharp turn and slips into a diatribe of the author's personal opinions. These opinions have nothing to do with the packaging and marketing, seemingly aimed at the concept of being ""Impossibly French."" In short, it starts out with a bang, then the dear reader gets pummeled with the author's personal views on unrelated, unexpected topics. Not only did it leave me crying, ""False advertising!"" I questioned the credentials of a regular contrubutor to the London Sunday Times, who provides statistics, then immediately disregards them in favor of her personal assessment, facts be damned! Buyer be cautious."
5,What a great book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading and re-reading this book. It's inspirational and interesting to read. I like the style, the humor of the author. I'm purchasing extra copies as gifts to other people."
1,Price,You can get this magazine on the magazines website for 18.95 for one year or 24.00 for two years. I was amazed to see that amazon.com was more expensive!
3,Alright,"The product was alright...its cool how you can change the needles and stuff, but the needles aren't very sharp and the blackhead removers dont work too well..."
4,So glad I ordered,"Never having owned tools of this type I wasn't sure of what to expect. I am so glad that I ordered these. It has made a number of unpleasant tasks much easier. If you have blackheads, whiteheads of other skin blemishes, these tools make dealing with them much easier."
4,science,"My 8 year old son is fascinated with this book. We got stuck on the first experiment, but that didn't stop him."
2,MEDICORE AT BEST,"This is certainly not the best Original Cast album ever produced. After listening to it, we can all be glad that Kander and Ebb went on to bigger and better things. It is nice to hear a young Michael Rupert bounce his way through ""Without Me"". In fact this song is one of the highlights of the score. There are some nice tunes, such as ""I Don't Remember You"", but unfortunately most are warbled by Robert Goulet in the most Las Vegas-y style imaginable. If you are a big show buff, you may enjoy this album or at least find it valuable as a reference."
1,Wrong hardware,This is the correct watchband for my men's Wenger watch but it is shipped with pins that are too small and too short to secure it to the watch. So until I can find a watchmaker with the correct connecting pins it is useless to me.
2,its straight,this disc aint even on the level of the other cds. the dvd side got juicy j and dj paul talkin about they come up a trip to the mall with Young Buck and a ride to see where 8ball and MJG get they whips cleaned. it got the stay fly video and the side 2 side uncut video too. the live performance of stay fly was some bunk though. its some good stuff on this music side too. It aight though. get that real deal Triple 6 murda music from they other cds though.
2,Victory at Sea Volumes 1 and 2,"What an utter disappointment. I've got the originals on vinyl, and this sad excuse for a reissue was not worth the money I spent. Most of the sound effects from the original have been left out, and the final 10-minute-plus piece, ""Symphonic Scenario"", bears not even a passing resemblance to the original. Don't waste your time and money."
5,Daily devotions with real content!,"Contrary to the modern trend of self-focused, feel-good, biblically weak devotional material, in Learning to Reflect, Bryce Morgan delivers solid content while addressing the deep, personal needs and struggles that so many followers of Jesus face in their daily lives. I highly recommend this book to all who desire to more faithfully love the Master with all their minds and all their hearts!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZ,"Wow I think I have found the cause for narcolepsy, Its Digweed on this CD, This has to be the most do nothing, go Nowhere CD I owne or maybe a close 2nd to that Danny T. Back to mine CD... what ever the case may be it Badddd! I wish I could have heard more then just the 15 second clips provided by amazon...But thats another story.... Digweed has in the past graced us with great music to listen to but unfortunately this project is lacking in both originality and energy...for my money I would get something else...good luck"
4,A great compilation...,"The opening song ""Cups"" by the Salt Lake City Orchestra was one of the first songs I downloaded on my ipod. It is such a great mix! I just love it!Oh yeah... and the rest of the CDs aren't bad either... ;-)"
3,Leadership and Change,"Buy this book if you are seriously into leading or coaching change in organizations. Borrow this book if you want to briefly observe another person's system for change management, and particularly if you want to see more details shared about the role of the CEO.For me a key point made by the authors is that ""this is not a book about leaders of change; this is a book about leadership and change. There's a huge difference."" [page 7]One of the things I learned from the book is that CEO's are called upon to be initiating leaders who provide appropriate and decisive leadership to their organizations during times of stability, change and transition, transformation, and crisis. However, their leadership is a key and not the key. Long-term successful CEO's know how to create and nurture a culture of leadership throughout their organizations."
4,Nice for the Price,"This stock was for my Marlin .22cal Model60sb with a stainless steel gun barel and brown wooden stock (the tube-fed model). PROS: The synthetic replacement stock was made of durable and scratch resistent material, stock was molded several thousandths of an inch smaller than your gun parts (this allows a very acurate and snug fit), and only cost approx 41.00 including shipping. CONS:the 8-10"" upper part that snaps down onto the top of the gun stock needed thicker molded 'snap-tabs'...the first gun stock I ordered already had 2 of these tabs broken off before I even got it out of the package, and other places aren't staying firmly snapped together and keeps sepating even where there are still tabs on it.The second stock they sent had all ytabs their but still didn't fully keep the the upper part from sepating from the lower part."
2,Bad materials and new Marlin management let Model 60 down,"Took this little beauty (stainless version) out to shoot a few times with my grandson. Both he and I loved it, except for how finicky it was cycling different types of ammo. Turns out this one likes Remington Gold. Yours may not. Then comes time to clean this thing. No real issues there. Put it back together, tighten down the trigger guard and we're done. Except the trigger doesn't work. A quick look at the trigger guard and it's broken. And I took particular care when I tightened it because it's plastic. No real crack - the plastic just sort of ""mushed"" apart. Very poor choice of plastic on this model. Called Marlin for a replacement and have been waiting over a month for my part. And the gun will not shoot without the new guard. Nice looking gun infected with a terrible trigger/guard design and horrible customer service. Go buy a Ruger. Or order up a metal trigger and guard from one of the aftermarket suppliers when you order this gun."
3,There aren't many other choices.....,"Picked up for a marlin 795. I knew I would have to modify, so I'm not too disappointed in that one. However, the top part that snaps in over the barrel does not fit tight, but it does stay on. The mounting screw in front of the triggerguard was perfect placement. The rear screw was a pain. Its not so much that the hole was off, but the angle of the hole was completely off. Luckily I caught it before I stripped out the hole. I had to dremel out a ton of material in order to allow the screw to be straight up and down and the screw was able to catch the threads. Bad thing is if you have a Marlin 795, you can either buy this or a $100 stock from Boyd's in order to add a pistol grip. Now that its on, it looks good, I just wonder how well the top piece will hang on there."
4,Fun stock,I like this stock. Fit well although it may feel a little cheesy. Also the sling mounts do not accept the bi pod I put on it because of the raised mounting point. I still give it 4 stars though because it makes the old marlin model 60 look cooler than I would have hoped.
3,hard to hear,"I bought it, when it was a must have to drive day, I used it couple of times and was always repeating what I said once, hearing piece is fine, configuring this to my cell phone was v easy, but I dont use this often anymore.I would not recommend this to new buyers."
1,Didn't work for me.,"From the first time I tried this with my Sprint KRZR it did not work. On my end it worked pretty well and was easy to setup but every caller hated it so after a few days I had to return. Currently, I don't use anything but will probably look at a Jawbone later."
3,decent purchase -- decent headset,"As far as blutooth headsets go, it's decent. I have yet to find one that is spectacular, so I'll keep looking (EDITED: but I gave this one to my teenage son and got a Motorola motorola H680 and it's much better). It connects fast enough for me to avoid missing phone calls that come when it is closed. I can check the caller ID on my ATT/HTC 8525 and if I choose to take the call, I have time to hit the slide-open button, stick the headset on my ear, and get the call without doing anything more (I don't lose the call to voicemail)."
1,sent it back,"Was really excited about this headset. It paired nicely with my Helio Ocean and actually sounded fine on my end. Callers, however, said that I sounded like I was really far away, distorted and unclear. I tried every way I could to make it sound better, to no avail. I sent it back - not sure what to try next."
5,SINGING WITHOUT EQUAL!,"This two CD set actually takes in three LP recitals Caballe' made in the very late 1960's, titled respectively, ""Verdi Rarities"", ""Rossini Rarities"", and ""Donizetti Rarities"". Each was critically acclaimed upon original release, and the verdict is the same: great singing from a great soprano. RCA deserves nothing but praise for putting all three together in a 2 CD packaging. This recording is a gem, and anyone who cares to know what great opera singing is all about should waste no time in acquiring this recording, which, I believe, is available at mid-price."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"This book is so bad! This book jumps around, doesnt explain thoroughly and has errors! If the teacher is teaching with this book then the teacher will be bad too. If you have a course with a teacher who teaches with this book, take an e permit to take chem somewhere else! I know what im talking about!!! Check out ratemyprofessors.com to see how people rated professors who used this book. Horrible!"
1,Poorly written,"This book is very poorly written and has a excessive typos and errors, especially in the answer section in the back - it's come to the point where if I get a different answer from the back of the book I usually assume it is the author who is wrong. It explains the concepts poorly, often over complicating them or leaving out vital pieces of information, or telling you about them a page after you really needed the information. It is not organized logically - we've ended up jumping around to different chapters to make it flow logically. Overall I'm not satisfied with this book on any level - I would have fired the person giving the go-ahead to print and distribute it if I'd been the publisher."
4,Interesting!,"i learned a lot with this read. i only wish the author would've thrown in some stones, made it a complete beginners kit! i enjoyed the description of each chakra- how it is at it's best and how you can align it back to it's best state. i will say that you may instantly identify and learn how to mentally and physically balance your chakras from this book. example 1st chakra: your divine environment. when your basically out of whack and feel insecure which directly threatens your thoughts to survival, you may need to channel or recreate your divine environment to feel secure or content. this i especially understood and still use this effectively. did i mention that it works!"
3,It works...,"This stuff works in defining your curls and reducing frizz. However, you have to use a LOT of it, making sure every inch of your hair is covered. It also makes your hair crunchy. To avoid this, use the BLACK bottle of mousse instead which also has a better smell. The only thing with that alternative is that it doesn't hold as well."
5,soft lovely music,When you are sick of bad t.v. news and want a fresh breeze of music this is wonderful!! it is already in my mac music list
3,silly fun movie for kids,"HI film friends! I recently viewed this movie despite how bad reviews were, hey you cant trust anyone! I really feel that kids would like this movie alot. It is an adventure movie, sprinkled with special effects and some badly edited kung fu. Kids would enjoy this movie , with their imagination they could make the bad kung fu seem awesome ! Really just a goofy movie to watch when you are completely bored, and it is only good for one viewing, barf! I gave it three stars cause the story was strong plus it had kung fu hustle stars in it ! woo hoo!"
1,H550 BT,This is the worst piece of equipment that I have ever purchased from the web. This product would not charge up at all. It appeared to be used and I return it and I didn't care if I got my money back or not.
3,Not a total loss,"I used the Microsoft Press books for the 70-305 and 70-315 tests with success, but the Microsoft book for the 70-310 test wasn't out yet so I picked up this one. After taking a Transcender test I've decided that this book just doesn't do the job and I ordered the Microsoft book since it has now been released. However, I do think that this book has excellent step-by-step instructions on dealing with Web Services. It will come in handy when I'm actually developing and setting up Web Services. Where it lacks is in the conceptual information that is necessary to pass the test."
3,Ponzu? Do you Ponzu?,"I have used many, if not all of Amazon's available ponzu, and this product is ok, but I much prefer Marukin Nama Ponzu 11.3 fl oz for $4.79. Not readily available, except online from AsianFoodGrocer.com: [...]It is really worth the difficulty of finding it.The Kikkoman is a product that I will use when I'm out of Marukin, but I take care not to be out! It is a little bland, but saltier than I really like. Amazon has many ponzu choices, and possibly one is almost as good as the Marukin, but probably not."
5,Great for Beginners!,"Sarah's dollmaking DVD is a great video for beginning dollmakers. I have very little sewing and no dollmaking experience, and her instructions are clear and to the point. The fact that she's Australian adds charm to the video, because Sarah is really fun to listen to, as well! I'm very happy with this DVD, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to make Waldorf dolls."
3,didn't like,"didn't like, no useful information, was trying to learn the Waldorf doll making process, didn't help, sorry I ordered it."
4,Stone Cold Busted,"Cyberspace's Most Wanted ~ Chauncey Cockfield.He is wanted by women all over, but for two very different reason. Some want him because he's the ideal man. Others want him because they know he's not. Who will get to him first?Busted began slow but picked up the pace as Chauncey upped the anti with his lies and antics. I enjoyed Busted and will definitely read Rhonda's next book."
3,Aliens Season Four,Most of the episodes are outdated. The best one is about the ruins in Puma Punku. Some of the episodes are a figmentof somebody imagination.
5,ancient gods,Ok i will just say it was more than i expected the moon and the grey theory was awesome especially the moon theory cause i something like that on the net anyway could write about it all day but i wont thank you and will the be a fifth series if so can you guys contact me thanks guys merry christmas and happy new year
5,Great show!,"This show opens is very interesting and has really made me think about things in a different way. My favorite quote is ""....as ancient alien theorists believe..."" which is said about 20-30 times show...LOL!!"
5,ancient aliens,"The dvd quality was excellent. I was amazed at the photography and the very excellent narration for this dvd. I highly recommend it to all school age kids, and all right wing conservative religious minded individuals."
3,Still going,Not bad and still interesting. I just think I was expecting to be mesmerized like I was with the first two seasons. They've gotten away from the 'alien' thing a bit and gone more to bigfoot and odd things like that.
5,Beginners Guide to Embroidered Boxes,This is a great book for those wanting to expand their horizons. Very clear instructions that anyone who has basic sewing skills can follow to make 3 different projects as well as lots of variations.
2,Difficult to read,"I thought that the authors syntax and use of colloquialisms (I guess),plus his style that left thoughts and situations unfinished, made for difficult reading.Jack Bryan"
1,Absolutely AWFUL printing - Not worth the money,"I was excited about getting a copy of this book, even willing to have a few sentences or words lost, but this book is the worst product I have ever purchased of any kind. Over 520 pages long, only the first 140 pages are readable. For the remaining 380 pages, only an occasional sentence or word is legible. Most pages have only dots and pieces of letters PER PAGE. There are only four or five pages in the remainder of the book that are completely legible. I have never given a one star rating. This is my first. I would give it a minus rating if I could. Don't waste your money. If someone has a printing that is complete or reasonably complete, I would welcome knowing about it. I still would like a copy."
4,So cute! Looks just like what big mommies use!!!,"This stroller or buggy is what my daughter received from Santa this year and she absolutely loves it. It is a bit big though and she doesn't like to use it as the stroller yet, as it is a little too tall for her. She is 3 1/2 though, so we have several years of use to look forward to. It is made very sturdy and should hold up well to wear and tear. Hot chocolate was spilled on it in the first half hour of having it (she was taking her baby to the ""beach"") and it cleaned up nicely with just water."
5,SLM Solutions,Great resource for anyone trying to implement SLM. A must havethat lists (what seems like) every vendor's product with an honestevaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of each. Every IT professional should have a copy on his/her bookshelf.
2,No anthems or good hooks,"I hotly anticipated this album. Being a Saxon fan from the early 80's (Denim & Leather rules!), I was pleasantly surprised that ""Unleash the Beast"" kept things rocking: Good crisp guitar hooks and tunes that stuck in your head. As I listened to Metalhead, I kept waiting for something to latch onto. Alas, all I heard were stale guitar riffs and Biff whining about evil doings."
2,A lot of frames for cheap,It worked well for our college apartment but I thought the frames up close looked kind of cheap. After college I donated them all.
2,Works good until clamp breaks,"Saw worked well for the first couple of years, then the pole extension clamp broke rendering it useless as a pole saw. Unfortunately, the clamp cannot be replaced."
4,chain saw on a stick,It was my first experience with any kind of chainsaw and I have survived it so far. Be sure to read the instructions. Assembly was easy enough. The adjustable pole is a good feature. You will need some 30 or 40 weight oil before using it and also a good outdoor extension cord. I found the instructions on adjusting the chain confusing.
3,You get what you pay for,"The hexagonal shape in the extension shaft gives more positive control of saw position. The plastic extension shaft lock lever broke on second use (flimsy construction), but it can still be locked with more pressure on the stub or with a hex wrench. Chain oil reservoir does not dispense oil but does leak. Otherwise, it performed as advertised."
2,pole saw,"poor choice for aging and shorter than 6ft tall folks. it was too difficult to handle weight and control for higher branches. without pole, saw was not as effective as other chain saw. messy, leaky oil."
4,electric chain saw,works very well. A little on the heavy side with pole extended. Abit difficult to add pole to unit. Over all satisfied
3,not that good,I have used the rem once on 4 palm trees. I noticed a few days later that the oil had leeked out on my work top. It did a good job on the trees and was easy for me to use.
3,Good enough,"Works fine for anything up to six inches or so; just don't be standing under the branch when it comes down! A little top-heavy, of course, but if you are not holding it out close to horizontal it's manageable."
4,Rem Pole Saw,Appears to be very helpful for use.Have not had enough time for actual useJames Swygert
2,Don't like chain lube design,"Overall my Remington pole saw is fine -- does the trick, though I'd opt for another next time. Worst is the design of the lubrication system. First, I've used other chain saws that automatically lubricate the bar and chain; this unit requires you to do so manually. Also, the small 'window' provided to check the oil level is, well, useless. I note too that the pole extender is awkward -- as you extend it, it actually 'pushes back'. Again, it works fine, but could be better."
2,"This ""Hot Stuff"" is lukewarm.","Having written an excellent book about AIDS (Victory Deferred), I expected more from John-Manuel Andriote. Instead, Andriote's history of disco is too brief and incomplete. I wanted to read more about the culture of disco, especially as it relates to those of us, like Andriote, grew up gay in the 1970's. Still, any history of disco is better than nothing to this dyed-in-the-wool disco fan and, within its limitations, Hot Stuff is OK."
1,"was nice, but doesn't work anymore","was a good scale while it lasted (about 6 months). Specifically, the LCD display isn't displaying anything. The unit still turns on and makes the appropriate beeping noises, there is just nothing to look at."
2,It's not what you hope for,"If you like reggae this album is not much reggae and if you like dub and electronics, the sounds are pretty dated (mostly echo and a few misplaced space sounds). Lots of filler with 1 or 2 cuts I might move to another CD."
2,Lacked Heart,"The characters in ""Heaven Can Wait (The Criterion Collection)"" were just about as dry as toast can be. I couldn't care less about lead character, Henry Van Cleve. His life, like this movie, was really pretty boring for someone who thought he should go to Hell. The only person who had some appeal was Henry's grandfather. Don't waste your money on it."
4,Window Regulator,"I chose 4 stars because it was easy to install, and it still works great. Would buy another one from here if I ever had to."
2,Depressing,"Thought I'd enjoy this movie, but honestly it just made me sad. Not as funny as I would have hoped."
3,Decent Watch,"I ordered this movie to watch with my boyfriend. From the previews I expected a little bit more of a comedy, and a bit less of a romance. This is a decent chick flick but I found it to be a bit boring and drawn out. I expected a lot more from the actors. Dont recommend this for guys per say (unless you are into romance movies, of course). But I would recommend this for a good girly watch, and for 1.99, its worth a watch. It is a bit slow, so dont be tired or you will be snoozing fast!"
5,"Wow! Much, much better than I expected","This was a surprisingly realistic story of love found, lost and re-found. But it doesn't follow the typical Hollywood formula at all. It goes to places I couldn't predict which was crazy and hilarious. Great characters. Really, really good. The thing is, it's not likely for everyone. Married people will like it a lot, but it may be over the heads of a younger audience."
1,"Plodding, painfully slow, no chemistry","This movie is plodding, painfully slow, and the main people have no personalities and no chemistry. I don't think a good director could have given the story any charm. It is neither a comedy nor a drama. They try to surround the main couple with outlandish couples and character actors to make the story more quirky or charming but it doesn't work and it a total waste of time. Somewhere under the boring is probably a story they tried to make about what it takes to make a relationship work but it isn't work anyone's time. So not work the money I paid to rent it."
2,Long and weird,This movie was supposed funny and while it had it's moments it really wasn't. It was just really long and awkward relationship between these two people yeah I would watch it at your own risk and maybe only if it's free. Oh and if you have nothing else better to do with your self.
1,An Annoying O.D. Of Segel n Blunt.,"Not only will you wish they never get together.....you will want to commit each of them to separate institutions for whiny losers (him), and selfish hags (her). Over long. Awful. Avoid."
3,Cute Movie .. very long and very slow but cute and a good rainy day watch.,The movie is really cute. It's a little slow and a little long and ALOT unbelievable but a cute rainy day watch.
3,Would not watch this movie again,Everything worth watching in this movie was in the movie trailer. I would not buy it or watch it again.
2,just boring,"This had the potential to be a good movie, but the reliance on quite a bit sophomoric, bathroom humor really brought it down. There were long stretches that were just utterly boring. Combine this with a predictable script, it was a big disappointment. I had higher hopes from a movie with Jason Segel and Emily Blunt."
3,Take a tip...please,"Don't write a movie and then produce and star in it. At least Segel didn't direct. A lot of this movie was meaningful and semi-deep, but got so bogged down along the way. The funniest scene is dinner in Michigan with all the deer stuff. Too many other unfunny gags including the toe bit because it was just thrown in without a follow-thru. Segel seems to be obsessed with nudity - his own, which we could all live without. I gave it 3*** because I just love romance movies, but 5-Years is seriously flawed. Watch it anyway."
1,Disappointment,"I was looking forward to watching this movie, but it was so boring. I am normally a big fan of romantic comedies, but I fell asleep on the couch halfway through, mainly because I didn't want to watch it anymore. (Oh, come on. We've all done it at least once.) It was dry and just meh. Waste of money."
4,Most realistic romantic comedy of all time,"I really enjoyed this film. I was surprised at how the film balanced slapstick comedy and a convincing and realistic development of the characters. I won't give it 5 stars because it's not something I will watch over and over again, but it was very sweet and thoughtful."
2,Okay I guess,It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. I expected to be rolling on the floor in tears laughing but it's just a few laughs here and there. Not a movie I would buy but might watch if it came on TV and nothing else was on.
3,Good rent movie... But not as much comedy than I expected,This movie has a really good plot.. But I expected the movie to be funnier. I think that with the way the story was in the end it just did not have room for too much funny scenes without seeming like it was trying too hard. Overall it's a good movie to rent for either date night or girls night.
2,Pass on this one,This movie started off funny and then d r a g g e d. I didn't even finish it! Pass.
2,Depressing,"Despite it being a ""romantic comedy,"" this movie was really quite depressing (I would estimate that about 75% of it was way depressing, and 20% of it was just okay, perhaps only 5% was enjoyable). Not quite up to snuff in my opinion."
1,A snooze,I felt like I was living through their five year engagement in real time. The pacing of this film is glacial.
1,Never got to watch it,"I tried watching this through the Amazon Instant Video app on my TiVo, but the movie never downloaded. I can't find the rental in my recent transactions either. I'd like to watch what I paid for."
4,Funny & Cute,"It was just a great movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon. I wanted something easy to watch and not take a lot of thinking. I don't think it was as good a ""Knocked Up"" but came close. If you like romance and some comedy, then this is a movie for you. Silly, but entertaining."
3,so-so,The movie took a little too long to develop and was pretty boring in my opinion. Not enough laughs and/or not enough intensity. You need one of the two.
3,Made me fall asleep,"I tried watching this show with my wife. While there were some funny parts in it, I was not very impressed and feel asleep about 25 minutes in."
2,Just OK,Typical chick flick. The acting was mediocre and the story line was average at best. Don't waste your money on this one. There are better movies out there.
3,Jason Segel is his funny self,"In the universe of ""chick flicks"", this one is on the funny side of the spectrum. Good for a date night rental."
2,eh...,"I thought this movie was okay. It could have been a lot better, but the acting was a little stiff and failed to draw me into the storyline. There were a few scenes that did make me giggle though. All in all, I give it 2 stars. While it wasn't the best and most entertaining movie that I've watched recently, it was okay for a night with nothing to do."
2,Charm can't save this drag of celluloid,I love Emiliy Blunt and really like Jason Segal but their combined likeablity can't save a film that loses its way in the middle. 5 years isn't just how long their engagment was its how long this film was . It just draaaaaaaags and shoe horns break ups and other relationships before the eventual reconciliation. A paint by numbers rom com but add being forced to watch the paint dry.
1,How does this garbage get made?,"Oh yeah, Judd Apatow is associated with it. This movie is awful. Don't waste your time, or anyone else's. No good."
2,Funny but Raunchy,"Had it's funny parts, but overall, not a very good movie.Maybe for a younger generation? Not sure, but this movie would have been better with a glass of wine, a drink or two, or a few beers. Okay, more than a few..."
4,Great and Funny Movie,This is a great and funny movie to enjoy with your wife. We had a great time watching this movie.
5,great!,great movie.. funny pretty much beginning to end...no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!
2,"""Has a Few Belly Laughs""","This film is much too cutesy, improbable and slow to develope. The characters themselves are continuously smiling or laughing and they are basically stereotyped cutouts. Although there are a few pretty good belly laughs to be had, you might want to skip this one if you are expecting a modern day comedy that is at least somewhat believable."
5,Favorite seasons,This is one of my favorite seasons of The Simpsons! The product was in excellent shape when it arrived and we have had hours of enjoyment from it!
5,Thank God it's Now in Print!,"This author was Lousia May Alcott's mentor. The story about Little Women came from this book! It is by far, much better with stronger morals and values that anything Alcott has written. I strongly suggest this book for all parents with children, especially daughters. It is one of those books you cannot put down until you are finished. Please read the review and more info about C. Yonge at hstreasures.com"
5,Chaise Lounger,I really love this chaise and the storage is pretty good size for the size of the chair itself. It is a bit hard so you don't want to sit too hard or it may be a jolt. The build is good and the quality is more than worth the price. Fits perfectly where I was looking to replace two armless chairs.
4,This is an OK tool,"Yes the oiling system is a bit messy. And yes you do need to tighten the chain periodically. But I found I can cut branches for an hour before needing to make any adjustments. The back half of my lot is wooded, and find this saw is very handy for cutting up limbs and even cutting dead 4"" caliper trees."
4,A well-pleasing disc,"De Larrocha's Mozart is one treat of the digital age that must not be missed, especially her interpretations with Sir Colin of the concerti. The final movement of the 23rd is light and bubbly, while retaining Mozart's effortless grace. The aria-like poetry in the slow movement of the 24th -- and the dancing contrasts in the finale -- are also memorable."
3,"Mystery's new cliche: ""The bum did it, not the butler""","That seems to be a recurring theme in today's crime fiction--the evidence isn't really obvious, but somebody saw a homeless person nearby. This one's definitely the tail-end charlie of the three ""Homicide"" books, in more than just chronology. Plus, I think Preisler didn't take enough care here with the cops on the case. He has Munch as pretentious and condescending here as he is in the new ""Law & Order: Special Crimes Unit"" series, when he isn't really quite that bad in the ""Homicide"" series overall. Plus, he continues to depict Giardello as a looming, thunderous presence--I've always read the guy as avuncular. And in this book, he tends to exaggerate street slang by black characters to the extent to where it might alienate a balck reader. He even has Lewis saying ""hey, yo, whassup?"" to Kellerman in one scene, when the guy is several years too old for that vintage of slang."
5,Easier to clean than muffin pans,Easy to clean. Just turn them inside-out and scrub with a soft brush such as you would use for a non-stick surface.
5,Great for a soap mold! Size of a standard paper cup.,"My daughter wanted me to make soap in the shape of cupcakes, so I bought these to use as a mold for the cupcake bottom.As far as size, they aren't quite 3"". At the widest point, they measure 2.75"".(See my attached photo on the product photos). But side by side to a standard grocery store paper cup, it is almost identical. (Another photo attached). When filled to the rim, it held exactly 2 liquid ounces. So I would estimate that if you fill to the fill line, it would be about 1.5oz.For soap, it was a breeze to remove the 'cake' from the mold. You just kind of peel it back and it pops right out. Also, these seem pretty durable, and I didn't see any bowing or distortion even when filled to the rim. However, you do get a little ridge if you fill past the 'fill' line, but it doesn't seem to bother me. (See photo).For soap, this works beautifully! Next, I'll try the real cupcakes."
2,Didn't work for me,They are cute and I like the idea that they are reuseable. But I ended up with muffins that were still raw on the inside. Will need to do more test batches to figure out how much longer they need to stay in the oven if I'm using these rather than paper cups or none at all
4,Fun but limited program,"The game is lots of fun but it doesn't take long until you've done all it can do. I am glad we bought it, overall."
3,Handy item,"Handy item to have for spoons, spatulas etc. Keeps drips off the countertop. I can even place a small pan lid on it"
4,The album is good but more N.W.A needed on it.,The d.o.c is goo being the silent membed from n.w.a so the album deservses a thums up!
3,"""SOMEONE COULD'VE DONE BETTER""","Although the D.O.C. was a new sound the delivery was a little suspect!, on funky enough towards the end put it on the needle and drop it one the one boyyyyyyyyyyyyy! sounded like a rasta turned rapper. the beats in my honest opinion is some of the tightest by dre yet, but the lyrics are not at all catchy. I think that we expected something new and this is what was thrown out at the time, im not at all hating on this album i do own a copy but, i still feel it could have been alot better if you think along the lines of gangsta rap this is by no means is this gangsta, gangsta. Be real and ask your self this? would dre attempt to try this in this day in age ""HELL NO"" he'd get laughed out of the industry for sure. Again the beats are tight but the lyrics are garbage true fans of lyrical talent would know this."
3,Does not support Windows 95 or NT,"Unable to install this product. It is misrepresented as operable on Windows NT. I have spoken to tech support McAfee.com and they have confirmed that this program operates only on 98, ME, 2000 Professional, and XP."
3,Okay,"Well this was a disappoint for me but it wouldn't be for everyone. I mistakenly thought this was one of the speaking dictionaries and bought it for my blind grandson. It is not, so I will give it to his seeing sister. Seems to work fine. The price was right, in comparison with other products."
1,Defective Electric Chain Saw,I purchase these item thinking it will do the work to remove an small tree; the unit don't event last one hour running when the bearing get damages (when I open the box I did add oil in to the reservoir to lubricate the chain saw)...However I was able to return it for an exchange; the new unit is being storage till next job.If want to consider this chain saw is not for constant use! That is my experience with this tool.
1,Horrible Product,They give you the little heat up stick to put on an iron. It just doesn't do the job. I ended up using a small curler iron. It worked but I ended up burning the couch too. Sucks!
1,Dont buy this!!!,"This product worked for the repair only to have it peel off 3 weeks later, i would not recommend buying this product!!!"
2,WASTE OF MONEY...I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS,"Got the stuff and the leather solution was switched with the fabric solution and caused a bigger tear. Seller wouldn't even give me a full refund for my loss. My suggestion, don't waste your time and money on this stuff...IT SUCKS!"
2,Stay away from the heat disk.,It gets the patch to hot or not hot enough. I burnt my spot. It shouldn't even be offered as an option.If you just apply the 300 degrees with an iron on the bad area only// you have good chance of success. This stuff does work.
4,Not so bad,"Packaging is not as pictured, it comes in a generic cardboard box. I used it to repair a small rip in a raincoat. The texture and sheen won't match but it is relatively unnoticeable. A large tear would be hard to disguise. For the money it's a handy product to have around. If your item to mend is outside the basic color chart, it can be a little difficult to match. All in all I recommend the product to make minor repairs. If you're looking for ""new"" then it would be better to buy it new."
1,liquid leather kit repair fiasco,We purchased the liquid leather repair kit to fix a tear in our ottoman. It comes with a metal stick - that is supposted to be heated to 300+ degrees - which is next to impossible. It made a large square of melted leather in our ottoman. It's basically ruined.DON'T PURCHASE THIS STUFF. ASK A PROFESSIONAL WHAT TO USE!
1,Terrible Results,"My vinyl office chair looks worse after using this product than it did before. I specifically followed the directions, but it looked better with a tear on it than with this gunk.I recommend looking for an alternative solution."
3,good but short,This is really an excellent book but be aware it is very short.. almost more of a booklet than a full book. Still well worth reading. Were it not for my disappointment with the length (or lack thereof) I would rate this at least four stars.
4,American Heavy Frigates 1794-1826,A good account of a topic that has warrented a good deal of historic conversation
1,Holy Crap! What A Totally Boring Waste Of Time!!,It is beyond my comprehension that these musicians with such great histories could produce such a weak album as this.to me it just sounds like bits and pieces of previously successful alt-rock bands from the 80's 90's. i detect no origionality whatsoever.compare this piece of uninspired dog-turd to something like MASTODON-Blood Mountain!...goodbye Panic Channel. i firmly believe you will be forgetten about in the very near future.
1,Utter Crap!,"What the Hell happened to these guys?Go listen to Janes' Addiction, Deconstruction, Trust NoOne, or One Hot Minute to hear how great Dave Navarro (and Stephen Perkins) can be.The Panic Channel needs to quickly be forgotten."
4,#ONE,"The first time I listened to the CD One, ""Teahouse"", ""Bloody Mary"", ""She Won't Last"", ""Blue Bruises""( possibly reminiscing of Dave and Carmen's break-up) and the acappella ""Lie Next To Me"" caught my attention. From subsequent listening I have appreciated ""Left To Lose"", ""Why Cry"" and ""Awake"" with mixed feelings on ""Night One"". To those who disliked it I say different strokes for different folks. I enjoyed this CD as much as the Velvet Revolver CD I purchased last year from Amazon."
5,WHAT U DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT STEELY DAN,this is an awesome documentry about steely dan. it showed why aja was so great & what went in to making it. a must for any steely dan fan.
2,Talking about making music,If you would like to hear how did they made this album - behind the scene stuff purchase this DVD. If you are looking for the music/preformace part of it - look for other DVD's.
2,This is not a concert DVD,"This is a documentary. People talk over the music.If you are looking for the ultimate Steely Dan concert DVD, order ""Two Against Nature."""
5,Nice...!,I look the most like that brunette model. I bought this so that I could look real sexy and it worked..
2,Rockport sizes not normal,"I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven""t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past."
4,Rockports,These boots are pretty sweet. The only problem is they run a little big. Too lazy to return them though. Great price!
3,Looks at bigger issues,"This book is about the crusades which involved the Holy Lands, not those of Spain, the Baltic or France. With that said, the book concentrates on the establishment of the Crusader states and where those states fell within the context of Christian and Islamic states in the eastern mediterranean. With that said, the thesis seems a little ambitious for a book of this size. I admire the author David Nicholle, although I disagree with some of his points, as he is clearly an excellent scholar of this topic. Well illustrated with maps and photos."
1,Late for Christnas,This was ordered on December 7th with the full expectation I would receive the book in time for a Christmas present. The book did not arrive before Christmas and my 86 tear old mother did not receive this gift as a result. I was issued an immediate refund but then to make this an even worse event the book showed up on December 28 and I had to reinstate the charge to my credit card because I had received the book.
1,Uh...,I had no idea what they were singing about the entire time. Its was depressing and not good. Do not buy.
4,Nice product,"Good value by ordering 2pack. Almost like getting 2 for the price of one compared to some vendors, so good deal."
2,Dull,"Christian Slater plays a crazed DEA agent, trying to get some money back that he stole from the evidence locker. Plot doesn't make much sense and action is dull."
3,travel charger,"product works fine. takes awhile longer than expected to charge, and the cord is shorter than my liking, but it is an okay product"
1,This is the product I ordered. It is NOT the product I received.,"This is the product I ordered. It is NOT the product I received. Instead, I received a flimsy, obsolete version that does NOT work with current iPods. What I received was e-waste."
5,Perfect,"I bought this wall charger for my brother's iPod Touch 8GB, since he would turn on his Xbox 360 every time he needed a battery charge. This is convenient; it's small and great for travel. The price is great! Wasn't expensive at all and it shipped pretty fast. I'm not sure if this charger works with any other models. We've only tried it with the 8GB, which is 3rd generation. My brother loves this charger and if I were to buy another, I would buy this one."
4,iPod charger,This item works good. I would buy from you again. Looking forward in working with you in the near future.
1,get what you pay for,"This is totally useless. I bought four of them so I would have one at home, one at work, one in my bag and one for a friend. I am not convinced they actually work at all. The LED turns on when plugged in but none of them charge my ipod 5.5 or iphone 3G. They seem to work with my friends ipod mini second gen. The prongs are poorly designed and fall out of whatever electrical outlet you plug them into, the cord is too short for my liking (I know that is personal preference, but I thought it worth mentioning)."
5,Unbaleeevable!,"I own about 25 concert dvd's- blues, historical, guitar players, rock and metal and this is by far the best dvd I have ever watched. The light show alone is worth the cost 2 times over. The song list is great and the quality of sound and video is exceptional. The only one close to this would be Rush in Rio. I practically had an out of body experience watching this, levitated, and was taken to infinity. Amazing!"
5,`MESMERISING,SPEECHLESS IS HOW I FELT AFTER WATCHING THE MOST SPECTACULAR CONCERT THAT MY EYES HAVE EVER SEEN! EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ON VIDEOIT WAS LIKE I WAS REALLY THERE. I REALLY DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THE FEELING I GOT WHEN WATCHING IT BUT IT TOOK ME INTO ANOTHER WORLD! DAVID'S LYRICAL GUITAR PLAYING WAS LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE THAT WASN'T HUMAN PERFORM!!! ALSO THE AMAZING LASER AND PICTURE SHOW WAS UNREAL!!! I THINK I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER A ZILLION TIMES!!!AS MUCH I LOVE PINK FLOYD I CANT BELIEVE IT HAS TAKEN ME THIS LONG TO WATCH THS VIDEO! I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES FLOYD AS I DO! I FELL IN LOVE WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
4,Holy Moley!! Disc 2 is unbelievable,"Great preformance. Outstanding visual effects. Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety??? Fire up a fatty, sit back, and enjoy!"
2,If you want Pink Floyd...go and buy Roger Waters In the Flesh,"Good music, but In the Flesh has a better selection of the real Pink Floyd music including Animals, The Wall (including mother)and many others (Includes almost all the songs of Dark Side of the Moon). Also better quality and better sound. You need to have this one if you are a Pink Floyd fan, but I enjoy 300 times more, In the Flesh."
1,Stop waiting.....,"The beauty of life is that there is so much to enjoy, and that beauty is not diminished one iota by the absence of this DVD. Stop waiting for it, don't allow the EMI clowns the power to continue teasing you. This DVD has already caused more anxiety than any enjoyment it may some day bring. Forget about it and you will be a happier person."
5,One Of The Best Concerts Ever Filmed!,"Pink Floyd's historic reunion tour in 1994(minus Roger Waters)is captured with a show that includes The Dark Side of the Moon album performed in it's entirety along with classic cuts from their whole catalog of albums. Pulse is everything a concert should be with songs that provoke deep thought and music to subduce any mood in the mesmeric form only Pink Floyd can accomplish, and all enhanced by backing vocalists, psychedelic images, and amazing light displays. Pink Floyd's Pulse is a show above all others. Magnificent. Electrifying. Tranquilizing. Spectacular."
4,Now let us all appreciate the greatness of Pink Floyd,"Since these reviews are best kept short and specific, meant to let others know if they should buy a title or not, I will simply state, that this is the best Music DVD of the year in my opinion and you should buy it right now!I have been only a casual Pink Floyd fan up until seeing this DVD. Although a concert DVD without Roger Waters in the band is not as good as any performance with him would be, David Gilmour is a genius, and he is well worth the focus of your attention. The actual quality of the production of the film itself is what makes this performance so incredible. It sounds and feels like you are inside the concert hall when viewing the DVD and I find myself wanting to watch it over and over again. This DVD has inspired me to go back and complete my Pink Floyd CD collection as each era of the band is special, and while I hope for a reunion with Roger and David soon, I will more than enjoy this 1994 performance for a long time to come."
3,Delicate Sound of Thunder Better Than Pulse,"Someone else in their review correctly opines: DSOT is a far better production than Pulse. I just finished watching all of my late 1980s VHS of DSOT (after not having watched it for years), shortly after watching Pulse on DVD; I was blown away at how great DSOT is and the 1987-88 tour that it documented. First and foremost, DSOT is shot on film, not video (like Pulse was). Even David Gilmour has admitted that in hindsight Pulse should have been shot on film. Second, the sound quality on DSOT is better (even without the digital enhancement). Third, Pulse has too many wide angle shots of the stage; not that many close ups like DSOT. Last, if you have a copy of DSOT on VHS, go back and watch the ""Great Gig in the Sky."" Unbelievable."
3,They Phoned This One IN..,"This video may have been longer than Delicate Sound Of Thunder but the musicians flat out stunk, including the only 2 girls back up singers, on Pulse the sax player, where did they get that mediocar musician, on DSOT the sax player was 5 times better and made a difference with his passionate playing, David Gilmour didn't even seem to be enjoying himself, as if he knew the band had no support from the others outside of the band it self.. DSOT is a lot more enjoyable to watch and the band actually seems to be having fun, several smiles from Gilmour, the band and the girls and the band and Gilmour nailed the songs with perfection!!.. This video PUlSE is far too overated.."
4,I wish it were in HD,This is one of the greatest concert DVDs of all time. It's too bad that it's not in Widescreen format or even better HD.
3,What a Mistake Not Using Film,This could have been a great piece of work if the production company would have spent the extra money to use film instead of video tape. The quality is slightly above that on YouTube.The performance is outstanding. David Gilmore's guitar work is outstanding and you can tell they really loved performing. God bless Rick Wright. RIP
5,Music Review,Incredible! So glad I bought it. As I remember them. Sound and accoustics are incredible on digital suround.
1,Bad product,Was excited when my CD arrived - shortlived. Wouldn't play. Tried two seperate players.Returned it to Amazon for an exchange for a new one. Same problem - it wouldn't play. Sent back to Amazon for a refund. Gave up. I don't know where Amazon got it but clearly it's a defective product.
1,why would you?,"Firstly, I have been a Pink Floyd fan since 1978. I love the band. Secondly, I have no interest in ""stuff"" that was produced by PF without Waters. I honestly tried to love it and miserably failed.Now I thought I'd give it another go...I have hired this dvd and I am very happy that I did because I saved myself 40.. I will never bother buying this stuff let alone re watching it.Completely fridgid production and performance having no energy, soul or mistery. If you enjoy Pink Floyd without energy, soul or mistery go for it, you will see a lot of lasers and even a bonus movie on the screen.Why would anyone bother with this lot?"
5,THIS CONCERT IS PRICELESS,"When I first got into Pink Floyd all I had ever listened to was the wall, this concert made me see other great works of this legendary band. Pink floyd is in fact one of the best bands of all time, this video proves it. I would do anything to see the pulse concert after watching this video, too bad the tour is over."
5,WOW!,"WOW! I don't need to saying anything else but, this is the best live music program I have ever seen!"
1,Enough of the reviews where can I buy it?,"Lots of conflicting reviews in here chaps, some of you appear to have it yet its not out... why are Amazon letting reviews go on for something you cannot buy from them yet? Or am I missing something like everyone else is selling it apart from Amazon?arrrghhh help me....!"
5,Pink Floyd - Pulse,"Riveting, incredible Floyd at their best. David Gilmour astounded me with his intensity. A total treat for the senses."
5,WORTH THE WAIT !,"THIS IS LIVING PROOF THAT NO BAND HAS BEEN ABLE SINCE THE MID SIXTIES TO COME EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT PINK FLOYD WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN THE DAYS WHEN TECHNOLOGY WAS LIMITED. THE LIGHTING, THE SOUND, EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST ONE HELLUVA SPECTACLE FROM START TO FINISH. THE MOST VALUABLE DVD IN MY COLLECTION. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!"
4,The Hebrew Bible Today: An Introduction to Critical Issues (Paperback),Great resource for understanding critical issue in biblical iterpretation for the Old Testament. I highly recommend it to any who are seriouse about bible study and wanting to understand both the context and content of the scripture.
4,A Trippy Love Story,"I picked up a used copy of Veronica based solely on the praise found on its cover, knowing nothing about the novel or the author. I was pleasantly surprised by the book, and can honestly say that it was like nothing I've ever read before. I do read a bit of fantasy, but Veronica is different in that the plot is grounded very firmly in New York City. It's what happens in the city to Leo, an innocent bystander who gets caught up in a whirlwind of magic and time-travel, that's the fantastic part. Though I found the novel to be innovative and the plot intriguing, I found Mr. Christopher's writing style a bit repetitive and forced. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who might be wanting to read it, but the ending leaves one wondering what exactly happened to Veronica and Leo -- it's one of those endings I'm dying to discuss with someone else who's read the book. A fun, yet thoughtful, escape from reality."
2,Disappointing,"This book was highly rated and got great reviews. Why? Although it had some sparkle in the descriptions, I found the plot and the characters to be one cliche after another, with an overabundance of meaningless symbolism and a very lightweight attitude toward Tibetan mysticism. The angel truck stop that serves angel food cake? The polka dot/black holes? Other writers have touched on similar themes with far more originality. This book, in fact, reminded me of a Cliff Notes version of ""The Magus"" by John Fowles."
5,Great Snowbroading pants,I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY!
4,The defiant one,Fast paced romance with lots of intriguing characters. Love . The story containing all family members to think as bout and catch up on in the previous novels!
4,MUSIC FOR THE SENSES,"I first heard this recording on the radio, a few years back, then decided to buy the CD. The overall offect is quite pleasing - hypnotic at times - and Bernstein's orchestra, the NY Philharmonic, is captured in great form under Temirkanov. The playing is also first rate, the violin solo by Glenn Dicterow is well executed. I found the orchestral contrasts between soft and loud passages to be exaggerated and in general, the various sections lacking in continuity of purpose. Music for the senses, but also music that has to make sense, I mean musically. Phrasing is the key - as in the New World Symphony or the Symphonie fantastique. This is lovely, but the whole thing seems to lack in perspective. The RUSSIAN EASTER OVERTURE is very well done, great sound, à la Russe."
4,tea pods,It's about time there were tea pods for the Senseo machine. I ordered the tea pod holder but it was back ordered so tried the pod in my regular coffee pod and it worked fine. It just means a little extra work to be sure all the coffee is rinsed out.I usually don't like mint flavor but wanted the green tea so decided to try them. Actually they have just the right amount of mint.
2,Don't buy this for the WiFi!,"There's a lot to like about this device, but it falls way short on one of its most advertised features, WiFi, and PalmOne is pretty poor on tech and warranty support. In short:Pros-- Nice design & features (when they work!)-- Fast processor/fast performance-- Integrated keyboard has great tactile feel and response-- Well built, sturdy feelCons-- WiFi is very unreliable (I'm only infrequently successful in getting it to connect to my home wireless network, and I've tried every fix in the book)-- Screen is unevenly backlit, so it appears blotchy, especially at the bottom (my T2 had a much better screen)-- PalmOne product support is all but non-existent.-- If you have a problem with a Palm, even within days of purchasing it, expect Palm to handle the problem by sending you a ""refurb"", in other words a used machine that may cosmetically fall anywhere between new and beat-up."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR WI-FI!!!,"As stated by other reviewers before me, after the Firmware update the Wi-Fi is completely useless. It seldom works with my home network. It can be working fine one minute and no connection the next. It frequently says there is no signal and no available network even though it is in the same room as my Netgear wireless router. The customer support from Palm leaves MUCH to be desired. Their people can barely speak English (apparently a Call Center in India) and do not acknowledge that the connectivity issue is very common. They had me send in my Tungsten C that was less than 90 days old and they sent me a refurbished one. It had the EXACT same problem right out of the package. They are now sending me another one that will undoubtedly have the same trouble. It is a great pda as long as you don't want to use it for wireless. DONT BUY A TUNGSTEN C FOR THE WIRELESS!!!"
2,Seems great..WiFi did not work..returning product,"I will have to revisit and post another review when I get my new Tungsten C...because this one is being returned. The WiFi would not connect to my home network or any hotspots.I sent an email to Palm tech support which made some suggestions (like hardcoding SSID and IP address) which I had already tried, and then called tech support. They basically read from the manual to troubleshoot it. Then said I better return it.Other than the WiFi no working, the T|C seems great. Colors are excellent, it is fast, and I like the keyboard. I had purchased some add-on SD cards with software and they all worked just fine.I am looking forward to getting a replacement, and will write again once I can try the WiFi."
2,Disappointing wifi,"I bought the Palm Tungsten C purely for its built-in wifi. I also have the excellent Toshiba e750 PPC also with built-in wifi, and it works pretty well, but the TC's wi-fi is a totall disappointment in comparison. Recently Verizon implemented a lot of public hotspots for their DSL customers in Manhatan, and I can get on easily with e750, but also have tons of trouble with TC. Most of the time it just sorta ""hungs"" when trying to connect. A call to Palm's busy tech support line did not resolve it. I also tried the hotspot in Bryant Park, it worked, but got dropped once, where as e750 was able maintain signal well. I suspect this product was not tested completely, and recommend you wait till bugs are worked out by Palm. Mine is going back tomrrow"
1,What coulda been,"The first album was very good. 2nd album ripped my heart out. One of the best bands of the last couple of decades. Drops of Jupiter got me thru some rough times. 3rd album was pretty good also but I could tell some changes were coming. In the meantime some very key and important members left the band and with them some of the things that defined the Train I had grown to love...left with them. This fourth album is a sore dissappointment. Pat's ego clearly isn't enough to carry this formation of Train. He is very talented but IMHO he was only one piece of the puzzle. Now , thanks to him..the other pieces are gone. They should form a new band and leave the name Train to live on in our memories of what it used to be."
5,"a new Train, a great Train","first off I am a big Train fan. For all of you who think this is a downfall from their rocker roots, that may be true, but there are still some good rock songs on this one, like ""Shelter Me"", ""Am I Reaching You Now"", ""For Me Its You"", and a few others. The reason for a more diverse Train, is because they are trying to appeal to more than just the rocker crowd, they want to be a more well rounded band and show people that they know more than just the rocker style, and I for one have really grown to like them more for that. This album has been a solid hit, and I sure hope that it will keep Train on the map and going platinum for years to come, because they are a great band, and I totally respect what they are trying to do here. I highly recommend this cd to all Train fans, and casual fans, and just everyone who wants to listen to good music.Rob Wilson"
1,A big disappointment,"I was surprised to see the blatant sexism, racism, and homophobia in this novel. On top of that, the central character drinks when she's pregnant, even though she knows it's not good for the baby. To make matters worse, the jacket copy reveals the fate of one of the main characters which makes it impossible for you to feel anything for him when disaster strikes -- he's almost superfluous from page one. I didn't even bother to finish this book."
2,"""Bridges of Madison County"" Danielle Steel style","You have to hand it to Danielle Steel--if bandwagon jumping was an Olympic event, she'd be Marion Jones. This novel was so obviously influenced by ""The Bridges Of Madison County"" I'm surprised she didn't dedicate it to Robert James Waller. Of course, since Ms. Steel cannot abide poverty (or even middle class), the book takes place in the swanky Paris Ritz instead of an Iowa farmhouse. I gave it two stars because it's been a very long time since I laughed this hard reading a book. Totally ludicrous and predictable--but, then again, what Danielle Steel book isn't?"
3,5 Days In Paris-5 Wasted Hours,"I really really like Danielle Steel. Or, rather I used to. She is to the romance genre what John Grisham is becoming to the legal-beagle world. The title , ""Five Days In Paris"" was provocative. However the content is just too similar to every other Steel sing songy recent book. The plot could have been so much more developed. A bomb scare, two people from America in Paris and they meet. And most know the rest. I must admit, I should have spent the 5 hours NOT reading this mundane novel. Shopping for lug nuts would have been better time management!Hopefully Ms. Steele will get some--steel & attempt to put a little more grit in her books. Right now she reminds me of a guy dating mother goose!other reading suggestions: ""The Ghost"" by Danielle Steel, ""Exclusive"" by Sandra Brown, and ""Ashes To Ashes"" by Tami HoagI appreciate your interest & comment votes--CDS"
1,"Cliche ridden, boring, plot holes...should I go on?","A friend recommended this book to me, so, respecting her opinion, I read it. What a waste of time. It's written in passive voice, totally boring, and filled with cliched characters who have mixed message motivations. Ms Steele drops plot lines like the proverbial hot potato, and her foreshadowing is poor. Though, maybe she doesn't need it, there's hardly an event you can't see coming. After reading this, and Jewels (I'll give anyone a second chance) I have to wonder why Ms. Steele is still being published. There are too many good books and too little time to waste said time on Ms. Steele. Spare yourself the anguish and read something else instead.Oh yes, there was one good thing about it. Victor Garber did the narration and that's the only thing that kept me going til the end. He could make a telephone listing sound interesting."
3,Not as juicy as the old ones,Flairs are great and they make writing more fun but these are not nearly as juicy as they used to be. Flair changed their formula and look of the pen. Kinda sad!
2,Not a one size fits most..........,"This choker can be slightly bent / adjusted, but it didn't lay right on my neck. I tried adjusting it to different widths, but it didn't curve around my neck no matter what, just kinda dug into the sides of my neck near the back. It also fell off quite often. Maybe b/c my neck is on the larger side, around 15 inches, but I'm not sure. The ends don't really curve around the back of the neck as pictured."
3,Plot and romance too unrealistic,"I'm all for escapist, not too heavy fiction, but I couldn't buy into the hero or his romance. Also, the biological warfare subject was very dated and not at all credible. Plot came across more like comic book from the 60's...."
5,Ice Reich,"THE BOOK WAS GREAT! Fiction mixed with non-fiction! The beginning of the book was slow, but when it progressed, I was unable to put it down! The book was SO good, that I lent it to my school-mates for them to read! I like how the book goes into detail...that is always a + in my mind!"
4,Admiration and Warning,"This is certainly an enlightening book, bringing up many points to consider. The writers are experienced, and though this results in an overly authoratative tone at times, their work is sound. The problem I have with the book is not actually the book itself. If a project manager can be so opened-minded as to step back and look at the problem with an accurate perspective, having a clear idea of all the facts of the case, they should be able to use this book to accurately diagnose and fix the problems they face. If they can't do that this book may be less useful.On the other hand, reading this book adds perspective, which may be enough to help one step back from the situation and reevaluate.In addition, since the authors reference their earlier works frequently, it might be best to read the other books first."
1,Terrible product...buyers beware!,"This has to be the absolute worst software I've ever purchased, no kidding. I wish i could give it a negative star rating, one star is way to much for this piece of junk. The firewall is a joke, even when you tell it to allow an action and remember, it keeps asking over and over until you just have to turn the stupid thing off. It doesn't block any pop-ups, can't update virus definitions. Actually, it doesn't seem to do anything except add frustration and irritation to computing. Thanks Mcafee, from another customer you cheated out of $69.95 plus tax. If you want a good firewall, download ZoneAlarm...it's free. Also, PC-cillin is a good antivirus program and and is reasonably priced. I wish I'd know these things before I wasted my money on this one."
1,Extremely difficult to configure,"I've used Zone Alarm, Norton Internet Security and now [regretfully] McAfee Internet Security. McAfee Internet Security is cripled by its lack of information and capabilities. Norton's product is by far superior.The alert boxes nor activity log tell you the full details of the remote IP address or ports not anything about the local communication. This becomes important, because, you might be perfectly comfortable having Internet Explorer access a web site on port 80, but freak out if Internet Explorer was allowed to share you files with ""web folders"" on a different TCP/UDP port.In addition, data is displayed in hexadecimal format with no interpretation. Even as network professional, I don't have the binary format of IP packets memorized.My advice is to skip this product and go directly for Norton Internet Security."
1,avoid this one,Extremely complicated...... Ineffective..... Made my XP system very unstable......Some pop-ups still get through.....System choked to a crawl while stopping other pop-ups.......Just plain awful. GARBAGE.
1,Lid won't seal properly.,After I received two of these containers I washed them according to the instructions. After allowing them to dry thoroughly I was unable to get the lids pushed down all the way. It seemed like the inside pressure couldn't be released. They are useless this way. I welcome any suggestions.
1,Do not purchase,"This product is horrible! Here is why""1) It is much smaller than I thought it was going to be. The decsription says "" cut to fit the bottom of your oven and never clean again. It is about the sixe of piece of computer paper .2) The bottom of it turned white and brittle and almost caught on fire."
4,Works OK,The power caluking gun is fine and will work with Poly caulk but it is best to warm it up first then it flows easily.
4,Decent value,"I live in a very old, drafty house. Every winter, I need to caulk the windows with ""seal+peel"". After a few windows, my hands start hurting from pumping the old-fashioned manual caulk gun. I knew there were power-assist caulk guns on the market, but never really considered them... until this year. The choice came down to a pneumatic assist (didn't like the idea of lugging a compressor around the house), a $300 rechargeable battery model (that did not ""fit"" my other cordless tools), or this one.For the money, it's fine. Certainly rugged enough for the occasional use I had planned for it, but surprisingly little power. I suspect it would be much easier to use with regular viscosity caulk; the removable caulk (s+p) is not free-flowing in the best of cases. Also surprised at how the batteries have lasted. I thought, with the amount of force being applied, that'd they would be dead by now - not so. Really, at the price, it's worth it if you even suspect it will help!"
2,Too little power to handle polyurethane sealant,"Due to its limited power (6 volts), it is excruciating slow in applying polyurethane sealant which is very viscous. Knowing what I know now, I would have purchased Pro-Quality 12 Volt Cordless Caulking Gun, a 12-volt cordless gun at comparable price."
5,Excellent Product,"I have never caulked anything. My husband does a horrible job caulking. I decided that I would have to take over this task. I researched and found this item and decided to try it based on previous reviews. It was fabulous!!! I just did my first caulking job and I am IMPRESSED!!! Maybe, just maybe, my husband could even do a good job with this tool!! I did invest in rechargeable batteries and would like a piece that extends the end for tight corners. I'm not sure they make such a thing, but I will look after I finish this review."
2,Minimal help to throwing instructor,"I purchased this book because I was preparing to teach young teens how to throw on the wheel. Based on Amazon reviews, I was expecting something special. I was very disappointed. There are at best one or two suggestions that are useful but they do not justify buying this book. Anybody with wheel experience and some teaching experience will do fine without it."
5,Tamari forever,"I bought this soy sauce because it was on sale, but it's now my preference! This is the best tasting soy sauce by far, and it's more healthy. Yay![tlr]"
5,Why isn't Kindred selling Millons!!!!!!!!!!,"In this life together is a stunning 2nd release from this duo, I just want to know why isn't Hidden Beach doing more to promote this great cd. Not one bad song this is one cd you can play over and over I will continue to buy what I call underground soul...Can't wait for the next release from this duo that I love soooooooooooo much you go Kindred & The Family Soul....Thumbs up on a first rate cd."
4,Kindred Returns,Kindred makes their sophomore release which is a nice tribute to their union and the obstacles they and we all face. I think this is much more like a live CD than their first which was a studio piece. I think their first effort was a little more polished but this CD still has some moving selections. Much love to Philly & Kindred keep us in the spirit of good soulful music.
3,I like it...,"First of all, it should be called, Some of... or A Few Names of... but not, The Names of.... The title implies that the book is an exhaustive study.This book does have a great deal of information in it. And all of this information is written for a ministerial student and in an old style. (The book was written a while back.) It is very difficult to read.I was also disturbed to receive a book that was marked up with notes written in ink and PINK highlighter. I know it was used but that would be something to mention in the description. What if pink made by left ear rotate backwards and caused me to break out in warts? A buyer has to be careful! Besides, I like to mark my own books.I would not recommend this book to a lay-person. BUT, if you can plow through it--it has wonderful gems about the whys and wherefores of the meaning of some names of God. Unfortunatly, the author chose only nine to explore. Best read in small increments."
3,"Was a great feeder, but they keep changing it for the worse.","We have been using this feeder for years and the birds love it. Unfortunately we have some problems with bear and they keep breaking it. Every time we have bought a replacement there have been design changes. The last change was to the mounting sleeve for placing it on top of the pole. The new method of an l-bracket combined with a v-bracket is clumsy make the feeder incompatible with the original pole. It would be much better if they went back to the original design. It still is a good hanging feeder, but the pole mounting options may the feeder too difficult to deal with."
2,Built sturdy but seed empties out,"Waste of a lot of good seed, ends up on the ground, but it is perfect for popcorn"
1,Won't Work,I couldn't get this remote to work with my Westinghouse LTV-30W2. I bought it when my dog chewed up the original remote. This is a common TV with codes listed in the remote's instructions. But the codes listed don't work with the remote. I never should have bought this remote. This remote represents a $30 loss to me. I do not recommend Universal products.
5,AWESOME BOOK ! ! !,This is a perfect book for all the beanie infomation you need. I would recomend this book to everyone!
3,Good but not the best.,"This album may be disappointment for fans who loves albums like Otis Blue or Complete & Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul Buy Now!Redding has credit in 3 songs, but no his best.His covers doesn't as great as on Otis Blue album.But in comparison with contemporary stars (Mariah Carey, Destiny's child) this is great album."
4,Good insight into the backstory,"Interesting look inside and behind Phil Collins: Face Value. Added depth to some of my favorite songs. Overall, pleased with this purchase."
1,This movie was a waste of time,"First of all, for all the movie critics out there, this had barely any real correlation to the book it was based on. I always thought Crusoe was English not Scottish, and when did he ever kill some one in Scotland? And bodies never washed up on the shore in the book. Friday was not African American in the book either, as he was portrayed in the movie. Even if you want to watch the movie for the sake of it's action quality, there is no action, so move along and pick another movie."
1,Bad Story,"Was trying to find a chinese story book as a gift to someone., And i thought this would be the good one with pictures.Endup, this is not the right story, and the title of this story book is really misleading. It is totally not telling the story of Moon Lady, and also the name of the Moon Lday they stated is wrong too. It should be Chang-E.So, whoever really want to know about the Moon Lady story, please DO NOT buy this book."
5,Speak like a Pro,"This book is valuable not only for those who have a fear of public speaking, but also for those who wish to come across in a way that is professional and interesting. In the world of continuing professional education in my own field, dentistry, I often find speakers that know their material, but are boring in terms of their delivery or in the way organize their material. Also as a speaker myself, I have experienced the challenges of putting together a well crafted presentation. Speak Without Fear addresses the issues of stage presence and performance in terms of how they apply to making presentations. I highly recommend it for professionals who are interested in taking their skills up several notches."
2,No good.,Overly cheery and annoyingly trite examples. Few lasting messages and really stretches to make the 200pg mark. Buy another book.
5,Excellent Surprise,"I'm an advanced exerciser and have lots of experience with workout DVDs. I like to try new ones to add variety to my collection and I only keep the ones that are perfect. Well, this one is one of those. I had tried a couple of older videos with Tracy and didn't like them at all. So, I was hesitant with this one, but couldn't ignore all of the 5-star reviews. I'm glad I didn't. This workout (playing all) is pretty intense, and I admit I used much heavier weights than Tracy and her team, but it was a blast. I felt completely worked out in a good way. What I also really liked is that she always did a group of 3 exercises and then repeated them 3 times. So, if you didn't get it right, or the weight was too light the first time you could then adjust it in the next 2 sets. Awesome workout!!!"
4,missing button,"This product is great if you have a creative zen media center, all the navigation buttons are there except for the on/off buton which should be there since it would help if you are far away from the zen. Except for that, it is a great product"
5,Very Cool Fun Tape,I got this tape as a birthday gift and my friends and I listened to it at my party. it was very cool because we could read the cards for each other right away. I always wanted to be able to read cards like my mom and now I can do my own readings. thanks
5,The Hobo Philosopher,This book is a basic primer on the liver and possible problems. It is not an in depth study on any particular aspect of liver disease. I knew very little about my liver and I wanted to know the basics before I did any further reading. This book was perfect for that purpose. It contains lots of general information on the liver and how it works. It gives a brief outline of most common diseases affecting the liver and their treatment in general. I was not disappointed. Now I will buy books that get more specific.
2,Worked until I had to install on XP,"I had a copy of this running in WIN 2000 & it worked fine. I changed machines & installed it with XP & it never worked. I kept getting error messages when I booted up my Outlook. My husband's computer (on a Dell installed version) kept catching viruses on the same messages (luckily I did not open any of the suspicious attachments). After uninstalling & reinstalling several times to no avail, I contacted McAfee support (by instant messaging). The first tech support took 30 minutes & no sucess - basically telling me to uninstall by hand about 15 files & then reboot. The second time on tech support, I spent 45 minutes trying to convince some idiot that the program was NOT working - finally forwarded one of the virus messages to him & his ""LAB"". Wow, I was right!!!! His fix that took another 30 minutes included a reboot (so I lost touch with him) & did not work. I am giving up & buying something else, my time is more valuable that this!"
2,tcp/ip challenges W2000NT/Active Sync,After downoading and installing the software for both the Firewall and the Virus Scan I was unable to use my sync software (Active Sync 3.5)for my IPAQ. After spending an hour with the online chat-support at McAfee the only resolution was to disable the firewall to get a a partial sync on my IPAQ. I still kept getting the message: tcp/ip network transport not installed? I was then directed to MS. No solutions from MS. At this point I uninstalled the entire program and requested a refund. I use my PDA as much as my PC and need a Firewall- Virus Scan program that works within this mini network.
1,Much worse then previous versions,"Virusscan 7 is big disappointment over the previous versions. The interface is clunkier, the background scanner often experiences a massive memory leak, which will eat up 700MB of Ram/Swap space before crashing, and it's a pain to get to the advanced options.But my biggest problem was that if you EXPLICITELY opt to not install the firewall, Mcafee still puts a rudimentary filter in (just no GUI) that has a tenacious ability to hose your internet settings. Windows will complain that it is unable to create sockets, and as a result many server applications will not work (Apache, Telnet)."
3,Calculus Only Please,I was looking for a more general book that would expand my understanding of my TI 83. This book is not that book. It seems like it would be a useful book for the calculus student. Don't buy this book unless you are involved with calculus.
3,"Eighth good, Ninth not so good","Flourish for Glorious John, and the Eighth Symphony are both high enjoyable - I think the Eighth is consistently under-rated.But I have a problem with the interpretation of the Ninth. It's just one of those symphonies which are extremely elusive, and to me, Slatkin fundamentally doesn't 'get it'. One has to entertain the dreadful possibility that the Ninth isn't RVW at his best. I'd hate to reach that conclusion, but on the evidence of this CD, you can't rule it out."
4,Good Book overall,"when compared to books in general this would be a ten, like all of Ann Rinaldi's work, but when compared to her other books (such as Hang a Thousand Trees With Ribbons) I give it an Eight."
3,An okay book,"Although this book was decent, I don't agree with many readers praising Ann Rinaldi. All of her books have a certain 'sameness'- a young poor girl whose father has died working in someone else's house. The fact that the main character had no real historical involvement limits the amount of action that can occur in the book."
3,This book does not exist.,"Hi. As the author of the material, I'd like to point out that this edition was never published by Marvel Comics. The material claimed to be reprinted in this volume has yet to be reprinted beyond its original comicbook format. Since Marvel has collected the first six issues of Inhumans in digest format (see ISBN 0785117555) there is a chance that this, the remainder, will one day be reprinted."
5,Very Good Album,"I keep seeing reviews on this album about how it didnt sound like AC/DC... and they didnt like Bruce Fairbairns producing sound... CRAP! this album rocks! the backing vocals sounded awsome! This album has many great hits, and not just the well known by everyone ""Thunderstruck""....this album is great if you ask me. A terrific album that launched AC/DC into the 1990's with great force!Tho, beeing a re-issue it should have had some extra tracks put in, but it doesnt matter."
5,The cutting edge,"The best effort since For those about to rock.This album has some classics like Thunderstruck and Moneytalks.All the songs are played very technically, proving the virtuosism of the Young brothers.Very Good!"
2,"Unfortunately, not good.","THE RAZOR'S EDGE just doesn't measure up to the classic AC/DC albums of the late 70's and early 80's. Although Brian Johnson's vocals are not bad, the guitar is unmistakably Angus Young, the songs are just not memorable. After listening to this for awhile you will want to dig out your Back In Black CD. Not terrible, but not very good."
1,un-riveting,"The first thing that annoyed me about this book was that I kept having to reread sections to follow where Moody was going. I think the story would have been better at 1/3 the pages, but then I guess it couldn't have been packaged as a novel though. The characters were disagreeable to say the least, I really didn't care what happened to any of them, and the plot is pointless. But what really annoyed me the most was the way all these nonexistant locations kept popping up (the Garden State Thruway???), aren't there enough real places in Jersey interesting enough for this story? If you want to read a good story about working class New Jersey, do yourself a favor and pick up Tom Perottas ""The Wishbones"" instead."
1,"There's ""Style"" and then there's Rick Moody.","Rick Moody's writing isn't of a ""style"" as so many would praise. It's pure redundancy mixed with instances of information that is meaningless to a story. I had to FORCE myself to read through the first story of this book. And that was only in an attempt to be fair.His interjections of special detail (i.e., the kind and color of rug Ms. Rondale purchased in the first story) are not at all ""genius"" or ""challenging"". They are distracting and pointless. If they do anything to what might have been a good story, they dismember it one organ at a time.I won't call it all bad writing - but it certainly isn't the kind of writing that I'd call good. Or recommend to anyone."
2,Couldn't Finish This One,"Let me be real as real as can be: this book was not that great I'm almost shocked at how many people rated this book so high. I had this book for a minute finally got around to reading it, I tried my damnist to finish it but I couldn't.The plot to me was not as creative and lacked serious conflict between the two main characters--particularly the primary character, Rio. I felt that character never really paid too much of an enough price for being a player. The rest of supporting characters were forgettable or annoying. The dialogue and humor was a tad boring and was lacking an imagination.I will be readingSins of a Siren (Strebor on the Streetz)soon cause I do want to give Curtis Alcutt another chance to impressive me with his writing. All in all I'm not going to pretend I was feeling this book, but hey, it happens."
4,A. P. Hill's Third Army Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia,"Although a love story runs through the background of this novel, it's true focus is on the Civil War as seen through the eyes of a staff officer of A. P. Hill's Third Army Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. From June of 1864 in Petersburg, VA to April of 1965 at Appomattox Court House, we see the every day life of the Confederate military and civilians in the Petersburg-Richomond area and end up hoping for the survival of individuals as we see the details of the failing war.Where My Love Sleeps"
1,My experience in buying products from verbaladvantage,"I ordered CD from verbaladvantage on 04/26/2005. After 5 weeks' waiting, I receivednothing. So I decided to cancel the order at the end of May. In the past month,I called verbaladvantage 4 times to get my money back($208.90) . Each time the people at the customer service told me I need to wait for 10 days. However, after 3 ten days, I haven't get even 1 cent back. I was furious and I called them again. This time they finally admitted that they can't handle the problem and they don't know where my money is. They asked me to call the customer service manager Lisa. I called Lisa three times I got nothing but answering machine. The fact is now that the verbaladvantage company charged me $208.90 and I got nothing but lies.So I shared my experience with others and hope someone could give me some suggestions how I can get my money back.Thank you.Jelly"
4,"Not the best, but close","I've been reading Sweet Valley books forever. I think the best is yet to come. But this was a good book. I just wish Jessica had friends in the series who would stand by her. Every time someone new enters the picture Lila and Amy desert her for the new person. Sometimes Lila smartens up, but Amy always runs straight to Jessica's enemy. I think Jeremy and Jessica would be good for each other, but they don't exactly have the passion Jessica and Will do. If Will would just get a backbone! I'm glad Conner and Liz got together or whatever, but I think she did it in the wrong way and hurt a very good friend in the process.I'm waiting for the one where Melissa, Amy, Lila, Cheri, and Gina get theirs to call one the BEST."
3,Welcomed addition to my Collection,"I received this video as a gift not too long ago (by request), and I enjoy watching it very much. Though the band has aged (set in 2000), I find it's the crowd going insane that helps light up the stage. If you're a true fan of AC/DC you'll love them and appreciate the music without overly comparing it to earlier hits of the 90's, as they are frankly not comparable. Their music lineup is different and refreshing, the video picture is great, and as stated by several reviews, the sound is not terrific. Might as well play it in Stereo.As a fan, watching them is always great, while angus runs off on Solos playing with the crowd, his brother Malcolm hammers out the power chords. You can tell Johnson's vocals are starting to strain, and don't come out as strong as other concerts.Live at Donington still stands out as the better concert to currently watch, while this remains to me, a refreshing change."
2,the truth from an AC/DC fan...and it hurts,well they are showing their age....to bad to..I was not impressed...Brian Johnson if you watch closely enough is straining A LOT to sing in many pan shots..you have to watch closely..I dare say it -- time to get a new singer.. namely the lead singer from Rhinobucket..truth hurts..sorry guys.
2,Detective cliches taken too far...,"I do bet Jen Bradbury would make a great caricature artist. In this book she managed to create characters that were very extreme examples of how they might actually be.Could a story like this happen in reality? Probably not, but if it happened the way life usually works it wouldn't be interesting enough to write a book about it. In this case, the author created an entertaining, unbelievable story with entertaining, unbelievable characters, and made it...well...entertaining but unbelievable."
2,Started w/promise but ended disappointingly,"I really liked the way this book began, smart characters, funny, quick dialogue, interesting plot. But by the end of the book, I was so disappointed: It's almost like the author tried too hard for the bizarre, the surreal, and put in needless violence for shock value. It just lacked somehow, lacked depth, lacked integrity. I kept on thinking this was a book that was based on a movie. It has that feel to it. Very Hollywood, but the stale, entertainment without a soul side of Hollywood. Better luck next time..."
2,Professional grade,This is not for the average comsumer. This product is designed for the professional web designer. Not for the end consumer as advertised. Many areas required knowledge of codes. I am going back to Frontpage 2003 til support stops. Expressions is much to difficult for my needs.
2,Too difficult for newbies with no working training features,I bought this because I had a website in frontpage that is being discontinued by Microsoft. I watched the tutorial which was just an overview...but when I have tried to watch it again to study it....it is frozen up. It is not my computer because it is new and top of the line. I called the company that produced it (a microsoft vendor) and they have yet to get back with me with the resolution.This program is extremely more complicated than frontpage and does not have a simple way to learn exactly how and when to use all of the many features. It seem like 3 programs in one overlayed on top of each other.
2,Too Professional!,"I have used Microsoft Frontpage for a number of years. Basically to produce simple websites for local Schools or Societies that felt they needed a web presence. The major convienience of FrontPage was its simplicity and usefull design templates, essentially using FrontPage was like using a wordprocessor. When this came out as an upgrade to FrontPage I bought it. The problem is this is too professional, essentially it functions like Dreamweaver. If you want to make professional websites for a living fine. However, if all you want to do is produce a simple information providing website, without all the Javascript bits and bobs, then stick with FrontPage."
3,Just the Facts,"As a travel guide, this book succeeds on a superficial level but fails to deliver the ""real"" knowledge that a traveler to Ibiza seeks. I'd like to insert a caveat here and say that much of the info that an Ibiza traveler is looking for is probably not something that any author in their right mind would put in a book. this book is mostly filled with info on how to book a flight, find a hotel, commute to the clubs or beaches, and where to eat. Great, if you are traveling to the Grand Canyon, or Great Wall of China but I doubt people go Ibiza to do the ""tourist"" thing. The book did touch on some wild incidents that were reputed to have occurred in the past causing my imagination to run wild. But overall, the book is very basic. I wish the ""Let's Go"" series would publish a book on Ibiza. They always put in what you want to know."
2,made in China,"I try not to purchase items made in China and this product reinforces my policy. I've only had these spoons a month or two and they immediately discolored in the dishwasher, which makes the numbers difficult to read. They also show every scratch and water mark they can pick up. I may as well have purchased them at my local discount store."
4,No Paul Rodgers But Still Awesome,"Bad Company was awesome in the 70s and even after Paul Rodgers and others left, they still managed to make another great one. This album is way better than one might think. It's nothing like the old Bad Company but it is just as good in it's own way. If you like BC give this a chance and you will be pleased."
4,There Will Be Trouble Only If You Don't Buy This CD!!!,"Bad Company's Here Comes Trouble is an excellent cd with great music. It has it all..from cruising songs ""here comes trouble"" and ""were going to take this town"" to romantic songs such as ""this could be the one"" and ""Little Angel"". Though my favorite song on the cd is ""Stranger than fiction"". If your looking for an excellent bad company cd then you definately need go no farther than this. This is the cd you want."
5,"This book was excellent, I couldn't put it down.","As for the other half negative reviews, like it being for a young reader, don't pay any attention to that. Obviously those reviews are written by people that can't look or think beyond their own egos nor actually try to imagine what it must have been like, what the permanent affects were after such an altering event, and obvious emotional scars that must have continued on and on... After I finished the book, I re-read the preface and understood why there seemed to be pieces ""I"" wanted answers to, but understood why they weren't there.I recommend this book to anyone of all ages. It's absolutely an amazing account of someone accomplishing a journey home with EVERYTHING against him and the beckoning door of death at every turn. How he survived? It's beyond me....Now, I will hunt for the DVD....if anyone knows where I can find the DVD, please find a way of letting me know. Thanks!"
2,Quite a bit of misinformation in he book,"I know this book is rather msinformative. To give just one example of my own :when the author describes Charlton Heston's 1980's tv series ""The Colbys"" he says it ran from 1985 to 1986. Wrong! The Colbys ran until 1987!And I thought there was a problem with the date Brent lands back on earth. Doesn't he land on our future world (around) 30 years earlier than Taylor does! And Taylor has already metZira and Cornelius in the story about Brent. Did Taylor go back into orbit and crash land on earth again (31 years earlier) and meet Zira, Cornelius, and Nova's parents. I know huh? Well the book seemingly doesn't mention this inconsistency (if I am remembering the film dates right, haven't seen either film in four years). But it is certainly wrong about the series ""The Colbys"". And I always thought Franciscus was superb as Brent myself. And I stil do!"
1,I think someone tampered with this item,I've purchased this before and I think a gel should be thicker. Looks like someone added watered it down. Would not purchase again from this vendor
3,Invaluable but DRY,"A unique analysis of the top 100 Cubs player seasons of all time up to 1997 (the year of publication). There is a lot good interesting, valuable information here that baseball fans will appreciate. There is real treasure here!But like most treasure you must move aside mountains of dry sand to get to the gems.Especially niggling is the lack of a good index or listing of the players alphabetically. For example, to locate Cap Anson, or Bruce Sutter, Ernie Banks, or Ron Santo you have page through the book a section at a time to find them. How the authors and the publisher overlooked this simple courtesy is baffling!Members of the Society of American Baseball Research (of which the authors are both members) will want to add this amazing resource to their library for the wealth of stats and the clever use of sabermetrics. The rest of us will most likely pass on this dry book./fwa"
3,best blade selection,"Has the blade you need to do the job; straight or serrated, and pretty, too! However, to big and heavy for pocket knife."
5,WOK review,"When Opportunity Knocks is a funny, quirky story with a sexy hero and lovable heroine. It's one of those books that you open the cover and can't put it down until you're done. Kudos to the author!"
1,Not a philosophy I endorse,"I read this when I was pregnant, and found it mildly amusing. HOWEVER, I found it of little use when I had the baby. It is glib, and patronising, I thought.As for the 'controlled crying' technique advocated here, I find it cruel and heartless. I couldn't listen to my baby cry for up to 10 or 15 minutes without offering comfort and presence. As for tying a door shut when a child has been sent to their room, again, I couldn't do it.I would recommend T Berry Brazelton's 'Touchpoints' as a better book for parents of young children."
1,where was the editor?,"I ordered this book to help me review for the tech exam. I am disturbed by the number of errors in the book. While speaking with a co-worker today, I found that the book says that 1 kg = 1000 mg. I'm glad I could correct the mistake before she takes the exam this saturday. I also found an error in one of the allegation problems. I ask again, where was the editor? Yes,there is some good basis information, but you cannot count everything as gospel."
1,what i thought,"I'm sorry I spent 35 dollars on this book. Not only is it filled with grammatical errors such as ""To take permit to destroy the Controlled drugs, one should be filled it out DEA form"" it also has many mathmatical errors as well. I only give it one star because it has a useful list of drugs in the beginning sorted by class. Overall, I was disappointed"

5,clean!,So good not to have to drink bleaching chemicals with my morning cup of coffee. Improves the taste.Not expensive.
3,Mr. Coffee Unbleached Coffee filters,"I love the unbleached filters, but they shipped me the bleached ones which I cannot use for my coffee prep."
2,Poorly Made,"I bought this oven for baking artisan breads, as it has been recommended in several books. Mine is defective. The lid is poorly formed and does not seal, thus letting the steam out of the pot as the bread rises. By the time I had discovered the problem I had used it 2-3 times so could not return it. Total waste of money. A $35 cast iron oven form Lodge does a better job and saves a lot of money."
4,Genealogy and well done.,"This book was recommended by my genealogy teacher, who is absolutely the most competent person in the field that I've ever heard of, and I'm a teacher myself. So I knew it was the best choice. It covers everything. I only left off one star because, since I have some poor illiterate relatives who never registered births or deaths and lived in isolated areas, sometimes the book seems to assume that one can find treasures in the attic and that there are records if you just look. But this is very minor--it is an excellent and thorough book."
1,don't know about box set,But I think the title is pretty much in bad taste considering the Vince Neil incident that killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Razzle.
1,Sales plug for other products,I was reading this before I gave it to my daughter since we are going on a trip to WDW. I couldn't even get through the first chapter. There are a lot of plugs for items the writer sells I guess. I told my daughter she could read it if she wanted. She started reading it and after the first chapter she asked me if she had to keep reading because she was bored. There is educational stuff in the book from what I read but I is not worth purchasing. There are other books I would rather purchase that are more educational for my daughter. This was a total waste.
5,Great Illustrations for a classic book,"We bought this book for our Granddaughter. We loved the illustrations so much we've decided to take the book home with us and bring it back every Christmas until our girl is old enough to take good care of the book, it's so beautiful."
5,A classic to marvel at,"I loved this book! Its content is timeless. The magic of Christmas will never die with this book in the house, held where it can be brought out each year and read again and again to celebrate the joy of the season it commemorates."
5,Fantastic songwriter and performer,I was so happy to find this on Amazon after looking for so long. Lisa is awesome!
2,Problem with the leather/rubber seam,"Length:: 2:35 MinsHi Folks, I did this review to show the failure of where the leather meets the rubber sole. I was really happy with them up to this point. I would recommend them if you aren't concerned about this happening eventually. Up until the seem broke apart I adored these boots! bummer."
4,these are the bomb,"Received my new boots just in time for my annual winter hunting trip in the Great Divide.. Australia...the weather has been very cold and wet with a light dusting of snow.The ground is like slush... muddy and wet...but my feet remained warm and dry right through it all...Our winters may not get as cold as it does up there in the northern hemisphere but hey cold feet are cold feet no matter where you maybe hiking or hunting.I must say how impressed i am with these boots, the soles provide positive grip over any terrain, the thickness gives ample support and comfort while providing a great cushion to the feet as you tromp along on rocky or muddy tracks. The insulation(400g) keeps your feet toasty warm whether you are walking or standing still..and the water proofing is with out fault... I highly recommend these boots ...for work ( I'm an interstate truckie), hunting, trekking or any thing else..Amazon delivered my boots on time and with no fuss...once again"
1,poor workmanship,"the left boot has completely fallen apart. throughout the entire circumference where the leather meets rubber, a complete separation has occurred. although I've owned the boots for over four years, i didn't regularly wear them. in fact, i exclusively wore the boots while i was camping or while up in the mountains. in all, i probably wore them a total of 30 times (that's being generous) and i never did anything more strenuous than walk or sit. my wife owns a pair of canadian made caribous, which she has worn for 15 years and they still look brand new! when not wearing the boots, they stayed in a cool, dry closet. to say I was disappointed to see the seam break apart while shoveling three feet of snow is an understatement. i also found the lacing system to be ineffectual and the heel strap equally ineffective. i would not recommend this boot."
3,"Decent kit, will not last forever","This is a very decent kit with a good bit of hardware, I've used it quite a bit around the house without any issues. Some of the bits are showing signs of wear but I think the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind here. It's a nice little kit if you are just getting started, if you want something that will last you the next 20 years you should probably look elsewhere."
3,"Good starter set, but won't hold up to heavy use.","I bought this set in a store a few years back when I purchased my first cordless drill. It's (sort of) lasted this long. The driver bits have a tendancy to become stripped after mild to moderate use- I think I've gone through almost all the included phillips head drivers- and the thinnest drill bits (useful for pilot holes) snapped in half fairly quickly and had to be replaced. Still, there's enough spare pieces that the set's lasted me over three years- so it's a good deal for the money."
3,"Good, but not great, buy","Lots of stuff. Metal not top quality. Over abundance of some items; none of others. Twelve identical flat screwdriver tips, but no metric socket or hex nut sizes. Would be better if selection of items was more thought out."
3,good for the money,"I have owned this set for several years. I bought it on a whim since it had so many sizes and kinds of bits and accessories I figured it would come in handy and save me a few trips to the store later on. It has paid for itself in both those regards. When I'm going into a DIY project and don't know what I'll need this is a good set to through in ""just in case."" Also, it has most of the odd-ball items (torx, spline, square, etc.) that have become very common, even in the home. The down side is that the quality deserves a one-star rating. I've had numerous bits snap off or shatter doing relatively light work. This set is certainly not for any serious job, but no surprises there. Overall, good set to have around and worth the money. That said, I'd be willing to pay a pretty health ransom for a higher quality set with the same diversity.Irwin, Milwaukee, Dewalt, are you listening???"
3,It's just tool pieces,"It could have been better if the black and decker drill pieces fit into the black and decker 6V pivot screwdriver. That's the only drawback about using that, so the screwdriver is basically no use at all!"
5,handy tool set,"This is best affordable compact tool set for the cordless drills.I was very excited to have this product, it has been the most handy set for every need around the house."
2,I didn't like it.,"i bought this because few of my friends said it is nice and handy.but, the soap part was gone really quick and fell a part in a week.it was too quick. my friend said she doesn't shave every day and the razor stays good for decent time. i like the idea of this razor that we don't need to use shaving cream. it is so easy. I guess this is good for people who don't shave everyday."
4,Remastered version....,"The ""remaster"" seems to be nothing more than a tiny bit of compression and extra bass. Sounds better than the CFH remaster... but nothing drastic ala the Megadeth remasters. I sort of wish they would have gone that route, but oh well, the record always sounded good. The liner notes are neat with band members talking about the album, similar to what they did with the CFH remaster. The DVD is ""meh"". Only 5 live songs? This performance doesn't capture the impact of the band, being that it was not a ""Pantera"" concert, (Pantera were openers, and the crowd response was perhaps the lamest ever with people just standing around) Highlight of the show was ""this love"" which was perhaps the best performance of this song in their career. The DVD must be 10% filled up.... add some other vulgar display shows! I hope Pantera releases more and longer shows for the far beyond driven rerelease.... but again, can't really complain for $15."
2,no good...better we need!,this album could have been better. there's no great classics except from this love and hostile. if you need better albums: cowboys from hell is just made for you!
1,By Demons be Driven song is not correct on this album,"Love Pantera. Love the album. But be aware this download does not contain the original song ""By Demons be Driven."" Instead, there is some sort of bad remix of the song which doesn't even compare to the original. Amazon, this needs to be corrected or at least noted somewhere so buyers are forewarned. If you want the real original album and one of the best songs, download this from somewhere else."
3,and.............,and Stop complaining about Pantera's album album covors. They are made for men. And Fred Durst my ass. He is a horrible singer. Phil anselmo's singing acually souds real unlike durst. Durst is the one trying to sound tough. What an idiot.
5,Metal in your face,This CD is metal in your face. By Demons be Driven is something you just HAVE to listen to. This CD is full of music that'll make you think and tear stuff up.
1,Garbage,"It's unbelievable how this was trotted out to the public as a high-quality repress/remaster. The LP 2 plays way off center, to the point of being unlistenable. I don't just mean my copy; I mean ALL of them, as I've tried several copies shipped from multiple locations, all returned. Stay away from ""Far Beyond Driven"", too; Every single copy skips. Shame on whoever works in quality control at the sham of a record plant that pressed these. They better get things straight for the other Pantera releases in fall 2010."
2,Pathedic and tired.,"This is a band that says it has talent simply because it can make a lot of noise. A monkey can learn to pull strings on a piece of plastic, or hit cans with two sticks. This band just throws together the same old vocals with a little different variation everytime.Just because they have been playing for a long time does not make them good. Emotion is where true talent lies, this band is just a shadow consisting of men who cant do anything beyond their pathedic band so they capitalize on people who liked their previous work. They have no emotion and are poor because of it.I would give them one star, but there is one nice riff on the album, nothing special but its a nice ten seconds compared to the rest of the cd."
1,Worst Metal Album of ALL-TIME!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this album listened to it once and gave it to a friend of mine. Unfortunately, we work together so I am repeatedly exposed to this trash. As someone who grew up with GREAT metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest to name a couple, in my opinion this is NOT Heavy Metal any more than Lawrence Welk is. Heavy metal music is not just fast riffs, there is actually some melodic flow to TRUE Metal music something almost completely missing from this CD. ""Walk"" and ""F***ing Hostile"" are the only cuts that are not utter agony to listen to. And even those are somewhat ruined by a lead ""singer"" who does not sing ONE note the entire album, just screams at the top of his lungs. The thing that aggrivates me most of all is that Testament, at one time one of the greatest Metal bands ever, has decided they want to sound like Pantera II, and that, along with the departure of Alex Skolnick, has COMPLETELY destroyed the band."
1,2 disc edition,"I am sick of these companies re-releasing and re-mastering already fine works. Most re-masters I've heard from heavy metal bands crank up the treble and low-end, effectively de-composing the bands' original sound. The only metal that needs to be re-mastered were our old Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath albums. Read the horrible reviews of the re-mastering of albums like Kill 'Em All vinyl edition, Cowboys From Hell, Cannibal Corpse The Bleeding, Deicide, etc. and you'll find this trend needs to be killed.As far as this new edition of Vulgar, it seems this was not remastered. Here is my gripe; Ever heard the ""newly discovered"" piss yet? It smells like it. Hollow is a strong track to end the album and (to companies listening) putting piss at the end of albums as ""bonus"" tracks sucks."
4,Every creed and every kind to give us depth for strength!,"So what if they used to play Hair Metal? So what if they changed their image and their music. This is a flat-out Kick A$$ metal album. It doesn't even matter if they are putting on airs, because they have some talent in writing music (unlike Limp Bizkit), and the music is what matters, not the image of the musicians. These are killer metal songs. This is a must-have for Pantera fans. You snotty little know-it-all Linkin-Park-and-Limp Bisquick-listening generation Y brainwashed bratty b@stards don't know from metal!"
5,This Album is Really Good,Everyone is entitled to their own opinion so here goes mine. Pantera is a really good band but I do not know any of the band members but that does not matter because their music is awesome. If you like metal or rock for that matter then pick up this album you will like it.
2,WHY .... WHY .... WHY,"Can someone tell me why an artist re-records their own songs when there was NOTHING wrong with the originals. Like most 80's albums, this one suffers from the 'let's do a remix' thing. Chris Rea has redone most of the songs on this set including a single which had only been released the year before. I refer to 'Let's dance' which was redone to a disappointing outcome. The difference is annoying. The most notable reworking is 'Fool if you think it's Over' which I cannot understand. The original was just beautiful ... why destroy it? The original is difficult to locate on CD, so thanks for being inconsiderate record company! 'On the Beach' is also redone. Once again, WHY?Note that the Australian hit 'Diamonds' is missing, and one wonders why that was never released overseas as clearly it is better than several tracks on this set. This compilation could have been so much more if they had left the originals intact. Please release a Greatest Original Hits!"
2,New Light Through Old Windows,"I am a hugh Chris Rea fan, in my opinion this cd is an overview of the the best of all his music.I would recomand this.Steve"
2,incomplete CD,"The version of this CD that was sent to me was incomplete: it did not contain all the tracks that were on the original recording. It is missing ""Driving Home for Christmas"" and ""Shamrock Diaries"". It also came with a different cover than the one shown on Amazon.com. This was most frustrating. I returned the CD and will order another one from a different vendor."
1,amateurish,"Kind of fun to read (and not without one or two moments of genuine value), this book lays out a plan to win money at home poker games on a regular basis. The theme of this plan: Surround yourself with losers -- the bigger the losers they are, the more time you should spend playing with them. Wallace's ""moral"" is that it's a good thing to deceive and manipulate people who are of weak constitution, because they can be controlled and you can get in their wallets. This is rather pathetic, but it's the thrust of all Wallace's work: If you find yourself losing, bully the winners out of the game and fleece the losers yourself. You may win a few bucks, but your poker will suffer. And if you adopt a general ""Wallacian"" mindset, expect your non-poker life to suffer the same deterioration from avioding anything challenging."
5,Cassie's a controller no way?,Cassie's tired of it . Tired of being an Animorph. She quits and gets lost in the woods around her house. Things couldn't get worse right? Wrong because she's in the woods with a controller named Karen. If Cassies infestede it's all over.
5,Haven't read it yet,"Hello! The book sounds okay, but the reason that Cassie is quitting? That ridiculous! She has no reason to quit! I mean, look at Tobias! He's been turned into a hawk. His life is twice as hard as the others. And he is the most willing to survive, and fight. His life would be hard enough as it was as a hawk, trying to survive. And Marco? His father almost cracked when his wife died. And Rachel? Her father moved away. And Rachel hardly ever gets to see him. They all have reasons to quit, but Cassie has the least. But the book sounds exciting. I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Rip-Off,An interesting concept but a lousy design. It broke on the very first attempted flight. I would not recommend the Air Kite to anyone.
3,Not all I thought it would be.,"Like the description says, for the money, it is a fairly good futon mattress. However, I personally can't sleep on it. It is very lumpy and HARD. I've had it over a month and it hasn't fluffed up to anywhere near 9"". It's more like 5 or 6 inches. I'm going to try to get a mattress pad/cover and see if it helps. Better than the floor, though."
3,damaged on arrival,"Although the box appeared undamaged, the bike arrived dented on the main frame. There was also a screw missing so we ended up just skipping putting on the plastic decorative pieces on the handlebars. There were no tools included to put the bike together, so make sure you have access to your own. The brake system is tricky to adjust so that the brake pads don't rub the tire on one side. Overall, the bike is a sturdy construction and my son loves it. We were just a bit disappointed in the condition it arrived in."
1,I wish it would have word out,"I really loved the look of this bike. I knew my son would love it. Problem is, when we tried to assemble it, the nut on the front wheel was completely jammed and we were unable to mount the front wheel because of it. Also the bearings on the front wheel were damaged. I tried to salvage it for Christmas but it was too messed up. Should have known because the box was torn up when it came in. I wish I would have read all these comments before I purchased."
2,Front wheel bent,"Front wheel was bent and misaligned out of the box. The ""mag"" wheel is just plastic and unlike spoke wheels of a regular bike is non-adjustable. Called the company who said they would replace in a couple of weeks. One month later I'm still waiting. My son likes his bike, although his wheel drags on the front brake calipers due to the bent wheel. Luckily his speed is low and not critical as he wobbles down the road. Rear wheel is fine and true, so I'm a little hopeful as I continue to wait for replacement."
4,my son loves it!,"First, our 4 year absolutely loved it - perfect for any child who loves transformers. Second - shipped within two days, received it a week before xmas and was easy to assemble. We were missing the reflectors and the back fender was broken but hopefully this will be resolved very quickly. Suggestion - WD-40 the heck out of the wheels, chain and pedals or it does not move very well. After that it was a very smooth ride and he has already mastered juping on and taking off! Next - taking the training wheels off eventually."
1,Can get a better deal,The product is satisfactory. however i think one can get a better deal than this. I returned the product and took the cowboy studio tent which is cheaper and works well.Got it along with the backdrops. Didnot want to spend $90 for a similar product at a lower price. However i must say that the photography tips on their website are Excellent.
5,great for bulk cooking and freezing,I am bulk cooking and freezing food so when My baby is born in 6 weeks my freezer will be stocked. These containers are working out really well.
3,A Mildly Interesting Read!!!,"I've read all four books in this series about the de Monteforte brothers, and I have to say that I was mildly pleased with the out come of this final installment. I waited with abated breath for this novel to debut, but alas, the book was not all it was cracked up to be. While the story sheds much light on the type of man Lucien was, it failed to hold my interest. I think that more of an intriguing story could've been established between Lucien and Eva. While it's nice to know that Lucien and Eva had a great attraction for each other, I felt that the author spent way too much time beating this particular subject to death. It would've been more enlightening to see the story about the aphrodisiac and the relationship between the queen and king developed more. Ms. Harmon's other novels in the series are far more entertaining."
3,Decent Effort but....,"I like Collective Soul. They are one of the few bands you can count on to deliver your $$$ worth on an album. the problem with this one is With each new step they take they took one back. the tracks are solid. but i found myself singing their other tunes to some of them. AND is it me Or does Counting the Days sound ALOT like Gel? morphed with Metallica's ""King Nothing"" I can Sing 'Wish I may Wish I might...' right along to it. It's Got a solid Solo which i find is missing in todays music. Teir second self titled CD is still thier best. I'd like to see em live some time, but they were here this past summer playing at six Flags Great Adventure! they are capable of so much more!"
4,Collective Souls Phase II,"Collective Soul has taken their personal trials and tribulations and used it to take their music to another level. I highly recommend this CD to new Collective Soul fans, as well as the ones that have enjoyed watching them progress over the years."
3,Collective Soul's Youth,"I have been a Collective Soul fan for awhile. I do not think this is as good as their previous work, but it is better than their last album (Dosage is my favorite cd of Collective Soul), but it is still good. There is only one song that i do not like on the CD and that is Home. I am fond of all of the other songs on the CD. There's A Way, How Do You Love?, and General Attitude are the songs i like the most. I would recomend buying this album if your a Collective Soul fan or random listener."
2,Collective Disappointment,"After listening to this wonderful band progress over the years, it appears they have taken several steps back. The music is all over the place and sounds like it's geared more towards.....Youth. I'll consider this one their ""Van Halen 3"" effort and pretend it never happened."
4,Youth pleases,"I've been a huge Collective Soul fan for years, my brother and I have all their albums. The new album ""Youth"" is another great musical journey from those rockin' Stockbridge boys. A few of the songs ""HIM"" and ""General Attitiude"" hinted back to previous albums with a more hymn-like feel at times, while ""Counting the Days"" and ""There's a Way"" get back to those great riff-rock tunes we've all come to expect from C-Soul. However, I have to say, since the departure of Ross the glory days of searing white-knuckle solos and perfectly fitting arpeggios and licks are gone, don't misunderstand me, the catchy multi-layered quality is still there but not as emphasized and imaginative as in days back when. All in all another awesome catchy batch of songs from one of the most underrated groups today."
2,"Generic, wishy-washy pop-rock.","Collective Soul has really lost their soul. The departure of guitarist Ross Childress may or may not have something to do with this, as Blender was as much a commercialized venture into radio-friendly pop-rock as Youth is. I must say I'm very disappointed in Collective Soul. While I do enjoy this type of music sometimes, it is not what made me a Collective Soul fan. I did not start listening to them to get this kind of music. It's interesting how many reviews this album has, though. Perhaps in their worst musical moment, Collective Soul is finding their best commercial success. Which is a depressing comment on the state of the music industry today."
1,No so funny...,"This one isn't as funny as the other ones. It didn't make me laugh. Junie B. is spoiled and a bad influence to little kids (it's not the grammmer) she just gets her own way. And my little brother's and I, don't like it. Junie B. is loosing her spunk, especially in 1st grade!"
5,dynamic duo,Sony and Cher were the perfect blend of talent their songs and shows will live on in my mind forever.the day Sony died so did the music...God bless his soul and thanks Sony for the fun...
1,"upset, no sound unless I buy your real audio","In reviewing your website, I think I might have purchased music from your site if I could here a little of what I'm buying. However, it's impossible without your real audio installation.Guess I won't return to your site..."
3,&#51339;&#50500; &#48372;&#50668;&#49436;,&#44396;&#47588;&#54664;&#45716;&#45936; &#46385;&#55176; &#50424; &#51068;&#51060; &#50630;&#45348;&#50836;.&#44032;&#44201;&#46020; &#52265;&#54616;&#44172; &#44396;&#47588;&#54616;&#51648;&#45716; &#50506;&#50500;&#49436; &#51116;&#54032;&#47588; &#54841;&#51008; &#48169;&#52636;&#54644;&#50556;&#54616;&#45716; &#51228;&#54408;&#51060;&#45348;&#50836;.&#52992;&#51060;&#49828;&#50640; &#46308;&#50612; &#51080;&#50612;&#49436; &#48372;&#44288;&#54616;&#44592;&#50640;&#45716; &#50857;&#51060; &#54633;&#45768;&#45796;.&#51473;&#44397;&#51228;&#54408;&#51060;&#46972; &#47560;&#44048;&#51060; &#50500;&#49789;&#45348;&#50836;
3,Again with SCAR..good but could be better,"It seems Scar can't put as much detail in the entire album as they did in 4 of their songs that i love. ""Deviate From the Norm"" is my favorite song on this album. It has substance, as does ""The Illusionist"", and ""Dreaming 24/7"". There is another song that i like but mentioning will not help other listeners. It just seems to me that they can't keep consistant with GREAT ideas. I have created a mixed cd from Symetric and Pitch Black and gathered my favorite 10 songs and I will leave it that."
2,Too general,"This is the book you find on the wire rack at Petsmart. The ones that are all pretty much the same, just that they've inserted the appropriate breed name as necessary. In other words, a general dog care manual. If you're looking for something a little more in depth, this isn't it."
4,Very nice set,"These seem just fine to me . I love that the metal runs through the handle and is riveted there (had some mishaps with the other sort!) The block, well, it'll do. I guess if you are a pro you'll have a different opinion but if you are a day to day cook, these are just great."
1,Dreadful,"These are the same caliber as the knives sold in my local grocery store (in what I call the panic aisle). They fail to meet even department-store standards. Compared to some of the some of the glowing reviews from other people, the knives I received must be cast-offs or seconds. As I got them at a bargain price through the Gold Box feature, I can't really complain -- but they should have been labeled as such. I can't recommend them ... unless you desperately need a set of knives. But if that's the case, to to the grocery store and buy the Ecko brand. At least you won't have to wait for shipping."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This is an OK set for the under thirty price point. It is not to be compared to High end knifes or even sub hundred dollar sets you can get in a dept store. The knife block is junk, the first one I got was split and had to be replaced. Very cheaply made, of pieces of plywood. I have a closeout store set I got for under ten and the block is soild wood. I was not impressed with this set.After two years with this set, it is gone. Even after handwashing all the knifes were rusted and dull. Stay far away from this set."
2,Misleading though correctly described,"I am rating it a 2 due to the use of Sabatier(and the $300 retail value) to market the knives. They are, however, as advertised. I would rate the value as 4 stars. Block is not high quality and walnut is rough(though could be sanded/polished."
2,Stainless steel rusts?,"The quality of the knives (sharpness et. al.) is decent. What disappoints me is that there are rust stains if I leave the knives in water too long (overnight) or put it in the dishwasher!I thought the idea of stainless steel is that it does not rust!Also, there is an extra groove in our set. We did get all the knives as advertised on the box."
1,There are many Sabatier brands,"Henckels is Henckels and Wusthof is Wusthof, but there are many different Sabatier brands. Lion Sabatier is not Elephant Sabatier is not Cuisine de France. The mark goes way back and has been broadly licensed to a number of cutlery manufacturers."
5,Excellent Knife Set for the money!,"I found these knives to be of excellent quality for the money. They are sharp, and have a general well balanced feel to them. I'm glad I bought them for $ 29.95 with free shipping."
2,Now I know why I never buy product I can't touch first,"Actually my husband thought these would be a very good value. I did not want to order but he convinced me. I ordered a black block (it was an option)..received natural (which wasn't an option). Found the blades to be rough and light. Thank goodness the shipping was free..I had thought of using as a wedding gift (with the appropriate pennies included), but am embarrassed to do so..the bride and groom deserve better!"
3,"Good, but...","These knives are a great deal for the price, but I thought that they would be better. I prefer the Henckel knives."
2,Not worth it!,My husband bought these knives for me since I am an avid cook but they cut horribly. Definitely not sharp enough and I often find myself using my other knives that I bought instead. This was not a good deal at all...I can't believe their original price......
1,"Dull, rusty piece of junk",These are the worst knives I have ever used. They even came dull from the factory. They rust in the dishwasher. Don't buy them and ...
3,Name brand but made in 3rd world!,"I love this make Sabatier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but guess what it arrives and yup it was made where!YUP not in France............................Sorry when you look to buy items they should state where they are made!Steel is not just steel especialy when it come to knives....The blade edge will vary so much and teh keeping a good blade edge is so important to suing a knive in the kitchen let alone anywhere else....ALWAYS check where a product is made.....1st clue sometimes is of course the price!I now live in the USA and do try to but US made products and inplore anyone else to do the same.....sure for some items when they are specialised ones for sure buy from that company!Otherwsie do the right thing support your local economy!So endeth the first lesson!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"Thought I'd get a deal on good knives, I got what I paid for and was not impressed."
3,Been Using Them for Years,"I 've had these knives for years... and although not the highest quality, the price was right and they usually get the job done...only problem is I do find rust on steak knives sometimes, which I have to use soap pad to remove."
1,not sure,Read the label it says made in china! If it was a real sabatier knife then if would be forged in france. It says so on sabatiers site. The name is not protected so people and companies can make fake sabatiers and sell them under that name. I would never buy a knife off the internet! Goto germany or france and pick up a real forged set
3,Decent value for casual cook,"Here is a set of knives that have the potential to be a good value for the casual cook. The knives feel good and have a full tang. However, they arrived very dull and needed quite a bit of sharpening and honing to get a nice edge. I use these for everyday cooking. These would make a good set for someone starting out or in college. Serious chefs would definitely prefer something better."
4,pleased,This knife set was an excellent value. The knives are very sharp and cut cleanly. They are comfortable in your hand. The wood block is attractive. I liked my set so much I bought two more to give as gifts.
1,They Have Started to Rust,"By the reviews, I'd say this was a great purchase. However, after owning these knives for two months now, spots of rust are developing on all of the blades. As one reviewer said earlier, there is a reason why these knives are so cheap. A friend of mind got the same set of knives a few months before me and she is totally happy with them (they have not developed rust and they are much sharper than mine). So, good luck if you have already decided to purchase them."
4,Good Knives,For the price these are GREAT knives. I bought another set as a gift and they were LOVED. I use mine all the time. I can't say anything about how they stand up in a dishwasher as I don't have one. They're sharp and have remained so and I am very happy with them.
1,poorly designed,"extremely hard to reach behind the mount and attach it to the jeep. The mirrors dont sit flush against it, and you will not be able to use the passenger side one if you ever put your door back on, its simply too far forward. They do what theyre supposed to do, but thats about it. They will also rattle a *lot*. I understand that the farther away from the body of a vehicle something is, the more vibrations will affect them, but thicker materials and more reinforcement would negate some of this. you will only have useful mirrors when at a complete stop. Additionally, they mount so close to the hinges, that you have to be *very* careful when removing/replacing doors to not scrape the paint off. If you love your jeep and dont want to scratch it or ding it or anything, but want these to look cool with no doors, take your doors off first, then put the brackets and mirrors on."
3,William Jennings Bryan,"Kazin does a good job at showing William Jennings Bryan's importance throughout history. Although he lost the presidential elections three times, he had a huge effect on the transformation of the Democratic Party. He emphasized the importance of religion and dedicated his life to the protection of the majority of the people. I'm not sure if he deserves the title ""A Godly Hero""; however, he did seem to have a positive influence on many of the average Americans during this time. I would have liked to hear more about his personal life in the book. Overall, a good resource for information about that time period and the events occuring then."
2,A little drawn out,Honestly while the book has good points and introduces a great outlook on William Jennings Bryan parts of it may be wordy and harder to get through. Not something to sit and rush through but worth it for the valuable information it provides.
1,it sheds,"As another reviewer mentioned, it sheds. After only a few uses, it began to crumble on me and the studio floor. Each time I finish I have to lint brush myself to get the green bits off. I now leave it at a studio I use once a week, and use it upside down so I don't go through the class with eco mat stuck to my forehead. Try another brand. I'm sure there's a great eco mat out there."
3,More like Medi-awesome Socialism,"You think you know a guy, then he goes and whips THIS out on ya. Well-written, super-formatted, and every letter is recognizable as part of our everyday alphabet (unless you're a Russian; your alphabet doesn't apply). The medieval part is pretty impressive, but the socialism part? FUGGETABOUTIT -- excellent with a capital X! And the price? Also insightful and well-meaning."
4,"Starting to lose some steam, but still good.","I've been a a big Simpsons fan for as long as I can remember. Currently I own seasons 3-10. The first disc of Season 10 disapointed me. I was really excited to see some of what I remember were my favorite episodes (specifically the hippie episode) But to my suprise, the episode was no where near as good as I remember it.Besides the first disc, I feel this is a strong season and a good purchase for any other Simpson fans or fanatics out there."
5,They Saved Lisa's Brain,"I'm still laughing about ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"". When I saw it for the first time I thought to myself ""Boy, they really got the sound of Stephen Hawking's vocoder right - only to read in the voice credits that the ""The World's Smartest Man"" had made a guest appearance. Classic!"
4,I love my copy of TROPICA,"On a recent visit to Culebra, PR, I came upon this wonderful reference work when a local landscaper pulled it off the front seat of his truck to show a dear friend of mine visuals on some of the plant material he planned for her garden. I spent just 20 minutes with the book and ordered it immediately upon my arrival home. I live now (and grew up in) South Florida, and I keep this wonderful volume in the living room for quick reference or simple browsing. Highly recommended!"
4,Erie Lackawanna,"This is a very well researched book and informative. However, not from the standpoint of what the railroad was like in terms of its rolling stock, customers, engine history, etc. It is more or less about the financial side of the railroad. Again, it is informative and researched in depth though at times it is a little boring, not much, but enough. I would recommend it as an introduction to this railroad and if you are interested in the financial collapse of eastern railroads during the fifties, sixties and seventies then this might be the book you are seeking."
5,Pretty Hamper,"Goes w/ my ladybug theme, fits lots of clothes and I can wash the outer bag when it gets dirty. Would be nice if it was a little cheaper though."
4,"Episode 3: ""Heroes"" Adaptation","Although entitled ""NASCAR Racers Road Thunder,"" this children's book is an adaptation of ""Heroes,"" the third episode in the NASCAR Racers animated series (a.k.a. Part 3 of ""NASCAR Racers: The Movie""). Obviously the story had to be simplified for its intended 4-8 year old reading level -- hence the references to the characters only by their nicknames -- but overall it is a faithful adaptation. The only two complaints I have involve the illustrations: (1) that the Rexcor cars do not have their numbers depicted, and (2) in the section where Zorina attempts to wreck Stunts, Flyer's car is shown instead."
5,Setting the Spoon Standard,Amco's measuring spoons set the spoon standard in every way. They are professional quality that no serious chef can be without.
4,Nicks revisits her solo hits,"Stevie Nicks had a rather successful career as solo singer and band member. At this point, five band and four solo albums should have accounted for a rather large number of hits to fill a two disc set but this set actually only revisits her solo hits.The mastering on this set is superb, especially on 'Stand Back' and 'Edge of Seventeen,' where it sounds as if the backing tracks were re-recorded. Still, there are some minor singles not present on this collection: 'Nightbird,' 'Two Kinds of Love,' 'Long Way To Go,' and 'After The Glitter Fades.' In addition, none of her outside collaborations are pushed on this collection. In place of those, you get two mediocre offerings of 'Sometimes It's A Bitch' and 'Love's A Hard Game To Play,' which aren't even written by Nicks. A definite must if you haven't purchased the solo records, and hardcore fans will want the new songs."
5,"Honest, introverted, and hard to put down","David Fiore's first (and hopefully far from last) masterpiece, is one of those little treasures like Ella Fitzgerald softly playing in your house on a Sunday morning. It just makes you feel good. The concept of finding true love is examined in a series of real life experiences. The stories and characters are sometimes so hard to beleive that they have to be real. Dave's facination with 40's film is equally interesting. The book should be on you must read list!"
3,Pretty helpful at first,"This is one of those typical, generic, several-thousand-page-long listings of every single college or university in the states. As such, it is both a blessing and a curse. For the very start of your college search, this will be a handy guide, with colleges categorically grouped at the beginning, and all the statistics and averages. Unfortunately, you'll need another book and visits as well as this one, because there is nothing about each school, just the dry numbers. This has been a consistently helpful book, it's just too overwhelmingly huge to be helpful after a little while."
4,Great Snack!,"We originally found these at a coffee shop and our kids loved them. The company is two mothers that were sick of only seeing junk food snacks available on the road, so they came up with a positive alternative. While purchasing 12-6oz boxes can be result in a surplus, just make sure the exp date is far enough into the future that you will be able to get through them all. We have shared them with neighbors and their kids love them too! All around a great product. Amazon had the best price and with free shipping it was a no brainer."
5,great Stevie cd,Great cd of Stevie's and got it fast. Thanks for the great service and quality of the product. I would recommend to my friends.
2,Too young of a rating,"This item has the potential to be a great learning tool, but when my daughter received this for her first birthday the age rating was 6-36 months, being 12 months the person giving this gift to her thought it was perfect, the book asked her to point out the house.....a 6-12 month old cant do this, the gift is practially useless until shes older."
1,Doesn't hold attention for yound kids,"I found this pretty useless, esp. for younger kids..My daughter is 22 months old and she just likes to press the icons on the book and not interested in listening. For sure doesn't hold her attention. Even if i try to hold the leap pad in my hands, and show her how it works, she doesn't like it..she just wants to take the book out of the leap pad and play with the book.."
3,Why do they make the cartridges so easy to lose!,"I liked that my daughter could touch and play and learn with the pad, and could repeat whatever lesson she wanted to. However I don't think that the age range should be for 6 mo.-2 years. I got the pad when my daughter was 3. It was almost too advanced, and she is one smart cookie. She soon got bored, and started to play roughly with it. The books weren't very sturdy, the spiral bound idea was a bad one, she colored all over them, and we promptly lost all the cartridges. I am pretty organized, and we tried to put them away each time, but I think it would be better if there was a way that only a parent could pull them out, or put them in the pad. They are also pretty expensive. I was also disappointed that there was only one book included with the pad. So for her to get anything out of it, I had to buy more and more books. After it was all said and done, I think I would have rather spent the $150.00 on regular books."
2,Not age appropriate,"Well, we just got this toy for our 11 month old - who is borderline obsessive about books. On the surface, this looked to be an ideal toy for her, but so far we are disappointed.While she will spend up to a half hour quietly flipping through board books, this toy held no interest for her. As other reviewers point out, the concept of pushing objects on a flat page (and pushing HARD) is lost on my little one. I won't even go into the GO button function. Since she knows how to make board books ""work"" on her own, she is less than enthusiastic about sitting on my lap and going through it with me.I spoke with a friend of mine who's baby is a bit older (20 months) and she is just now getting to the point of handling this toy.All and all, I'm planning on putting this away and hoping to bring it out to a better reception in about a year."
2,new copier cartridge light on ink,"From the get-go this supposedly new toner cartridge [[ASIN:B000AYMPT0 Canon E 20 - Toner Cartridge - 1 X Black - 2000 Pages] was different from those used in the last 17 years in this extremely nice, durable Cannon photo copier. It copies everything way lighter than ever before. Plus, it's a waste of paper figuring where to set the darkness level. I'm betting it doesn't last long and I'll have purchase a new cartridge..."
1,not the sender's fault,The movie came in a reasonable amount of time and was in good condition. It was just not what I wanted. I have been looking for a decent movie on the 6 major belief systems for quite some time and have yet to find one. This move will not hold the attention of 10th graders.
1,Why do kids need to know that baseball players cheated ?,"I am very disappointed with this book. I was really hoping for a children's book that I could use to introduce my 8 year son to Babe Ruth. But, instead, I read a book that refers to baseball players and cheating. In the end, I will never read this book to my son. In my opinion, young children do not need to be introduced to the concept of baseball players cheating. My suggestion, publish a book that highlights Babe Ruth's accomplishments as a world series pitcher that becomes baseball's home run legend. I do not recommend this book."
1,Not for me,"I am going to sum this movie up in one word: TERRIBLE. I was highly disappointed especially since it had so many good actors/actresses.The most interesting part of the movie was the first ten minutes; actually that was the only part of the movie that made much sense. The movie had no story line whatsoever. It's just random pieces of several characters lives, crappy ones from the looks of it. The only person I really liked was Dakota Fanning but then at the end she did a 180. Very confused. It ended weird and you are just as confused as when the movie begins. Not a single thing made sense to me. Just awful."
2,Terrible but Kate beckinsales sooo hot!,Terrible but Kate beckinsales soo hot! ... But they did manage to make me sick about what a terrible person she was in the movie and all that
2,very fragile,These glasses are made of very thin glass and break very easily. I have even had glasses break when dispensing ice from the refrigerator. Three of the glasses have broken and I have only had them for a few months. I have had other sets of glasses for years and never broken one. The double wall seems to work well but these are definitely not worth the money when they break so easily.
3,Drining glasses,"I loved these glasses however, when I purchased them I was under the impression that they were acrylic when in fact they are glass. The lines are beautiful and they are just what I wanted...classy looking drinking glasses BUT because we live in Florida, entertain outside a great deal AND have stone floors I was looking for something (in both sizes) to use everyday. Two of the four large ones are broken - one happened in the dishwasher. Really disappointed that they weren't acrylic...would have ordered two more sets to replace my horrible plastic glasses. Anyone wanting insulated glasses that are real glass will love these."
4,Works great!,After reading some mixed reviews on this site and others I decided to buy anyway. It works great! Connects easily and software installs quickly. Very sleek design compared to Zips of the past. The reviews that cited conflicts which resulted in system lock-ups are real. The Zip needs it's own USB port (don't use a Hub) and you need to be running Windows 98 SE or you will experience difficulties.It's a great drive for storing files that may be too large and will possibly clutter your disk.
1,this game is not that great,This game does not bring any fun whatsoever to a normal gamer. I cannot think of one good thing about this game. I am just posting this review to tell you all to not waste your money on this game...So listen to my words of wisdom.
2,I actually liked this game--not much to it though,"Everybody seems to really hate this game, but it was the first one I got for the XBox and I actually had fun playing it. Maybe its because I'm such a Samurai junkie. True, its not very involved and probably only worth [less]. Gameplay is pretty simple...there are a couple of maneuvers but it mostly boils down to button-mashing. The graphics are neat in an offbeat kind-of-way, but definitely not what the XBox was designed for. I'm not very familiar with gaming systems, the XBox is my first since the Atari 2600 I had when I was 12...but I think this game is probably compatible to something from 5-6 years ago. Absolutely NOT worth buying if you don't have some obsession with Samurai dueling it out...its cool to a point, but nothing to write home about."
4,3D's on methodone,"I like this the best of the 3Ds albums, much more organic thru the centre of the album but with all the guitar attack intact. Accessible for the most part, this is the best place to start if you wish to expand your Flying Nun obcession(sp) into the 3Ds, the most alternative of the FN bands and least championed. Contains classic ""Dust"" and Devil Red and Big Red Heart are classics too."
3,Lousy video/color quality.,"These really should've been remastered before selling them. It's hard to even tell what color Hazel's hair is because it changes constantly, even within the same episode."
3,I Fantasize About Hazel,"This is a great TV show starring the scrumptious and sexy Shirley Booth. Me and Mikey McCluskey (aka as O U) would watch this show as kids and fantasize about Hazel. We loved how she wore those sexy maid outfits and strutted around dusting and whatnot. Mikey loved how she used to bend over to clean the toilets and show a little undergarment knicker in the process. We all know that Hazel sure packed that maid's outfit tightly, with curves in all the right places. Yep, this show got Mikey and I through our puberty years, didn't it Mikey? It sure beats watching Leave it to Beaver reruns, especially if you are erotically obsessed with Eddie Haskell and are from Michigan.In fact, when you think about it, I am amazed that network TV showed something this racy and provocative in the 60s. This is cutting edge stuff folks, and all those modern porn movies that have maid fantasies in them can be directly traced back to Hazel for their inspiration."
3,Dangerous indeed...,"This book is fun to read , mainly for little tidbits and stories about the man and his many bands. But if you are looking for a literary or critical evaluation of his work, look elsewhere. There are no annotations ;you have to take the author as the authority for much of what is presented. Some of the analysis is wanting and has a psychedelic gleam. For example there's very little examination of how feminists view Zappa.Their objections to some of his ""nasty"" songs ( eg. Harry you're a beast) are glossed over by appeal to some ""superior"" position FZ supposedly had- as if he were poking fun at the males in the situations. I can't claim to know where he stood , can you ? There's surprisingly little analysis of his family life; I think that's where the answer to questions about the man would be found . That is if anyone cares to ask them."
1,vtech 9122 is a terrible phone,i have had this phone for only two months. it is already not working. real junk. very unsatisfied with this product. will never buy from this company again.
2,Full of cliche anecdotal generalizations,"In my opinion the author uses anecdotal information to support sweeping, and oten stunningly cliche, generalizations. Too poorly supported to be considered a scientific text, and two scattered to be a good overview of creativity, this book is largely a stew of factoids. If I had not read a few texts on creativity prior to this one, I would have had a hard time picking out the germain points in the book. A much better overview of creativity can be found in R. Keith Sawyer's 'Explaining Creativity.'"
3,Another Tom Sawyer Movie,I've titled this another Sawyer Movie because for me that's all it is. I have tried to collect movies based on Twain's characters and this is simply another of those. It's OK. Some are much worse and some immensely better.
4,Time to Remember Red Foley,"Red Foley has faded abit in our memory of country greats and this collection shows why that's too bad. This very inexpensive Four CD set is chocked full of great tunes. Foley had a very pleasant Baritone voice and he used in many great novelty tunes, ballads, sacred songs and love songs that are in the package. This collection is a must for Country music fans and as noted the price is right. I give this CD set only 4 stars because about 1/4 of the songs are not memorable or of high quality. There are certainly 75 gems here among my favorites are ""Hang your head in shame"", ""smoke on the water"" and ""peace in the valley""."
2,A few hits and a lot of misses...,"I bought this album years ago because I liked the song ""Love is on the Way."" There are definitely a few positive moments besides that song. At several high points, Saigon Kick sounds somewhat like Guns N' Roses. There are a few short instrumental tracks that are interesting. The last song, ""Chanel,"" is a lot of fun, if almost out of place on this album. And ""Love is on the Way"" is a great song from an era of power ballads and hair that was way too long.Unfortunately, the majority of this album is just noise, full of screaming, anger, and profanity. I'm not any huge fan of this genre of music, but there are bands of this type that I do appreciate. Frankly, I think this is a rather mediocre offering. I'm probably not alone in wishing that I could select out the few songs that I enjoy from this album and discard the rest."
4,A supercalifragilistic tic-tac-toe,"Das EFX style is pretty different from anything else I've heard. The closest comparison I can think of is Busta Rhymes back in his Tribe Called Quest days. Overall this is a very up-and-down album, but Mic Checka and They Want Efx are two of my favorite hip-hop tracks of all time, and are well worth the purchase price. Both songs have outstanding lyrics that somehow still manage to get stuck in my head to this very day. Jussummen and Straight From Da Sewer are also solid tracks, though by no means great. The rest of the songs on the CD are pretty irrelevant, although there are a few catchy lines here and there."
3,Too basic,"I picked this up hoping it would help out in learning VB. The book does a good job at teaching the material it does, but that doesn't go very far. It could probably be summed up as an intro in a well-written book. Not to say I did not learn anything, and the fact that I have had a C programming background has an impact, but it was not worth the 24 hours to read the book (yes I did time myself - 24 hours and a lot of dinky notes!!!) ..."
2,Poorly written.,"I have had good luck with this book, ONLY because I have had other programming languages. It does get into actual coding, but does little to explain how it works.The authors experiments in the CD are quite lame. The ones that DO work off the CD offer no usefulness.If you are good with programming already, this book will be useful if you are new to VB, cause you can figure out how to make bigger better projects. But most of what you do in VB will be of your own experimentation. Don't count on this book offering any real programs. It merely gives you the puzzle pieces, and it is up to you what you do with them."
5,Quick Start on Visual Basic! Definitely for beginner's only.,"I had been working for my company as an administrative assistant for about 6 months. I am now transitioning into becoming a visual basic programmer.This book got me on my feet quickly! This is the best book I purchased for this endeavor. I came in with no knowledge of the Visual Basic environment. The only experience I had was with BASIC as a kid and with PASCAL in high school. Now, I find it rather easy and can whip out a program in very little time.This book definitely helped me to get where I am and I now make much more money than I did before. And is spending this amount for this book worth it? DEFINITELY! I went from making just over $20k to making almost $36k. This is worth that investment!I hope this has been helpful. Have a great day!"
2,Not what it says and not for the novice!,"This book will not have you cranking out VB apps in 24hrs. I expected a series of hands on exersizes walking you through creating applications. THIS BOOK WILL NOT DO THAT FOR YOU! If you know nothing about VB stay away from this book. What it is a long-winded explanation of VB and how different aspects of it work. This is not for the novice and will not teach you to build apps. There are no projects that will produce running VB apps in this book.If you want hands on practice and step-by-step instructions for building apps then get SAMS ""Teach Yourself Visual Basic is 21 days"". ""VB in 21 days"" is 21 hands on lessons in building VB apps and writing code and is excellent for beginners. The lessons start out easy and get progessively more difficult as the lessons progress until at the end you are writing fairly complex apps."
2,Rather dull..,"I actually learned more VB stuff in Access 97 than I did in this book. Fortunately, I did not buy the book, but when I was reading through it I couldn't help but wonder ""Why include Visual Basic 5 CCE when you are attempting to teach Visual Basic 6?"""
4,""" THIS IS CUTE ""","WHO WOULDA THOUGHT I'D LIKE A XMAS STORY WITH TONY DANZA ? WELL, IT'S CUTE AND A LOT BETTER THEN SOME OF THE STUFF SHOWING ON T.V. THIS SEASON . I GOT IT DISCOUNTED ON AMAZON AND I'LL TELL YOU , IT WILL REMAIN WITH THE FEW OTHER HOLIDAY DVD'S I OWN . VERY CUTE AND FOR ALL FAMILY MEMBERS EVEN THE HUM-BUG MEMBERS, AS IT HAS DANZA IN THE BEGINNING AS AN INEPT WANNA BE BANK ROBBING SANTA . ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL ."
3,Not sweat proof,Glasses are not sweat proof as advertised. There is condensation on bottom of glasswhen used for cold drinks marking the surface that they are placed on.I have had other manufacturers of this type glass that were free ofany condensation so these do not meet my expectations.
3,Good Bag but lacking handle,"This is a good looking bag for the money but has a big drawback. No lift handle under the carry sling so there really is no good way to lift the bag out of car trunks, etc. Too bad. A bad oversight."
5,Really Detailed Instructions,"This breaks each technique (verdigris, liming, stippling, etc.) down into 5 to 7 steps. Each step is shown in a photos. The book is compact, but covers a lot in 224 pages. Some effects I hadn't seen before in books or in the brochures at paint stores. There is one showing painting faux sandstone blocks.I can hardly wait to get the paint and try one of these effects. They are shown for a variety of surfaces (walls, floors, furniture, accessories).Highly recommended if you want something besides plain ol' paint."
1,I was looking for an unscented soap,"There are many different Nubian soaps on Amazon. I thought that what I had ordered was unscented, but I received Lavender and Wildflowers. Due to my allergies, I will not be able to try this soap out and will have to give to a friend. If you like Lavender than you will probably like this scent, unfortunately anything with a scent causes me to get a migraine. I was hoping to be able to purchase a shea butter that was unscented... guess I will have to continue my search."
4,Good enough for home user,"It works great so far since I purchased this scanner two weeks ago from local Staples even though my computer is 3 years old NEC Ready 340T AMD300MHz running Windows 98. It is connected through usb hub with self-powered mode. I scanned a 4x6 color photo at 300dpi. It took only 25 seconds. Scanned image was good enough for home casual user. If you really want to get professional quality scanned color photo image, you should get real photo scanner ... . I scanned some art work, poster, pictures from art magazine. Scanned images were really sharp. If you are not satisfied with color, you can easily adjust with using photo editing software. I use Corel Photo-Paint 9. My friend who is professional graphic designer was impressed by the result. I guess that you have to know how to use it before complaining. ... I definitely recommend it."
3,Not bad for 60 bucks,"...have to admit I was a little frustrated when I first started using it. It does not come with a detailed user guide, just a quick-start pamphlet that helps you install the software and hook up the hardware. I wish there was a user guide that showed how to use the software, I'm a dummy and need the step by step instructions! I figured out how to do a basic scan but that's about it, I have no idea how the other software works. I also have to warn you (I think another reviewer mentioned this)--the scanner has a hard time when it comes to photos with a matte finish. I keep getting white specks in the photos..."
2,Great scanner until it died,"Bought one at CompUSA. It worked great. Last weekend (12/15) I figured out how to make the scanning software work perfectly for me (in a way not described in the light-weight instructions--outline subject, hit preview, and preview will resize window so you don't have to use pre-set paper sizes). However, that may have been the signal to the machine. It simply stopped working on 12/16. Nothing I did got it going again. Unplug it, plug it back in, reload drivers, press any of the 3 buttons on the scanner, etc., nothing. It became a too-big paperweight and I only had it for about 2 months (and didn't have the invoice any more, drat). I guess it was too light weight to keep scanning comic books. Fortunately, the Omnipro9 that comes with it works with my ancient Vivitar scanner :)"
2,Alabama Girl,"I am from Alabam so when we ordered this we did not have any idea about warmth comparison. I think if you live in the north this would be great because you are use to the weather, but I am very cold natured so the pants did not keep me as warm as I thought. I also got to close to a heater and they got burned so I found a storeup where we were at and bought a pair and felt a very big difference in the warmth factor. I think if you are skiing and walking these would be fine. But if you are standing around watching stuff you need warmer pants. Fit fine and was comfortable. If you are a cold natured persond I would recommend lots of layers and spend a little more money."
4,We Wonder Of Love,"For Phil Collins, the 90's seemed to give in some mixed blessings to his life, and career. That also went the exact same way for his songs too. The songs that he was making were still absolutely strong, but had new sides to every story, everyday. That was meant to be with Everyday. The song was the signature ballad behind his 1993 album, Both Sides. The song is very mellow and simple, a constant to several of Phil's biggest songs in the 1980's. Although the single isn't sold anymore, the music spoke very elegantly. It is just a shame that people don't really appreciate this song of Phil's anymore. It is truly one of his best."
4,sound good,"Im using these in the my shop as aux TV speakers, powered by a 15 watt amp, they are plenty loud and clear. Not what you want for a high end sound system but work great for my shop."
3,"A great value for the price, but you may run into a little trouble.","I was very pleased for the first six months or so of owning these speakers. After that, however, one of the speakers' speaker wire connectors broke while I was trying to plug it in. If I want to use that speaker, I need to tape it onto the speaker. It sometimes comes off and I have to do it again.Other than that, they're great quality speakers. Be sure you aren't fooled by the size. They are not as big as you may imagine. They come down to about the size of an iPhone 5 and a half of one stacked on top of each other."
4,"for $22, can't really complain","these speakers work fine. not much bass, but i can't really complain since it's only $22..."
5,Sounds great,These sound great I have had these on my boat for year now. And they last and still sound great.
3,"Good function, bad form","I was initially disappointed when removing these from the box: both grills were dented. They were smashed in slightly in different places. It would cost more to send them back... so I just decided to live with it. I'm pleased to say though that they sound great. Crisp highs, adequate lows. I compared them directly against energy take speakers, and they held up quite well. Needless to say, they won't reach the lows the bassy lows, and a sub-woofer, or larger speaker would compliment these well, but they sound very good alone. I would rate these a 5 if it were not for the cosmetic damage. I've heard that this is expected from these. Also, on one speaker, the back junction (where you connect the wires) was crooked. My guess is that these are engineered very well, but some poor kid in China was a little sleep deprived when putting them together. I say buy them :)"
5,Speakers,They sound good and look and feel of good quality. I will mount them on the outside of my shed so when I'm in the yard I can listen to music. Thanks for a great product.
5,Exceptional sound for the money,"I HAVE HAD THESE SPEAKERS OUTSIDE ON MY DECK FOR OVER 4 WEEKS. I LISTEN TO CDS, AND SATELLITE RADIO THROUGH MY STEREO AMPLIFIER. I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THE SOUND AND QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT."
4,Dual Speakers,"Came on time in good shape. Speakers were easy to install, all hardware except speaker wire. Sound good. Installed on boat."
4,Get the job done,"For the price, cant really complain..got these about 6 months ago and installed them in my backyard, worked great for the gatherings i had from spring-fall. thought i could leave them up year round but recently i noticed that the grill screens were beginning to rust. Should be expected since i live in a shore town with salt air. The screens are almost impossible to take off the speaker, making repainting difficult"
4,Good outdoor speakers,"These are cheap, sound pretty good, and so far have held up quite nicely mounted under my eaves. I have three pairs of them to get tunes to various places around the outside of my house. They are not as good as a nice pair of inside speakers, but you're listening to tunes outside in a noisy environment, and you can't blast out the neighbors, so with that in mind, these work fine and look good doing it. The black easily hides in the shadows and you don't notice them after a bit.My only gripe is that it's a spring clip to attach the speaker wires, and I'm pretty sure that after some time it will let the wire loose contact with corrsosion. I'd prefer a more positive attaching mthos, such as a screw-on terminal, or something that took a bananna plug. Minor issue, but that's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Outdoor speakers,"These speakers look and sound great.The price is resonable.I just hope they look this good in a couple of years.My last pair lasted about 9 years, not bad.I would recomend this product to my friends."
5,Stunningly beautiful.,"For those of you who have been to Yosemite, this book will make you long to go back. For those who haven't, you'll want to experience the park for the first time. The priniciple feature of this NG Park Profile is the photography, and as usual, NG doesn't disappoint. I feel the author does a good job in the text of dealing with many of the features, and issues, of Yosemite, but the pictures are the core of this book."
3,Just ok,"They were really cute in the box, but they fit weird. They slouched/bunched at the ankle. So that took away from the cuteness factor once they were on. They also ran rather large in foot size."
1,Terrible,Doesn't show my dogs urine spots at all on our rugs.On the other hand my dog loves/hates the light and tries to attack it.
1,"Poor quality, flimsy, and brittle - waste of money!!!","Don't waste your money and make the same mistake I did. The first red flag was when I had installed the batteries and the unit failed to turn on. A good palm slap on the side fixed that problem. A big problem with the unit is the lack of ergonomics. It is very awkward to hold without touching the lamp itself.The worst happened when the time actually came to cleaning out the actual stains on a linoleum floor, which unsurprisingly, requires both hands! This unit has NO good base to set it down on the floor and maintain the light on the spot being cleaned. Did i mention that the light beam is rather narrow and total darkness is needed to even see the stains to begin with? Long story short, after I'd set down the light on its edge while wiping down one of the walls, the unit fell over and shattered the light.Don't waste your money on this garbage."
2,Dim Light and Cheap Flimsy Design.,"It is as if this were designed so it would be broken. Flimsy design awkward to hold and use without a grip or handle or even a safety tether to hang on to. You have to be very careful not to drop the unit as there is no comfortable place to place your hands as you do not want to touch the long bulb. My bulb was not very bright perhaps it was engineered that way :). It takes 8AA batteries and although you can use an AC adapter, no AC adapter was supplied. This product is overpriced, I would expect to pay about $9 for something like this. I did see stains, so it does seem to work."
4,Works pretty well,"This little blacklight does its job pretty well. You have to hold it at most 2 feet away from the floor, to be effective so you have to either bend over or crawl around. It highlights things pretty well on every surface we tried (carpet, counter top, laminate hardwood, porcelain). Whatever you do, do not take this thing into the bathroom. Unless you clean every nook and cranny daily, you will be disturbed by what you see!"
4,Great Lightweight Thermals,The fit is great and these keep you fairly warm in cold weather. My only complaint is that the thermals often peek out from under my shirt cuffs. For this reason they are better for casual wear than work.
4,"warm, comfy, but shrinks too much!","This thermal top is a good, comfortable material, and very warm as well. However, I would suggest that anyone buying this, either order one or even two sizes larger if possible - that's how much it shrank! After just one wash, the bottom hem of the shirt was at least 4 inches shorter than when it came, and the sleeves also shrank by a good 2-3 inches. Since this is a good product for the price, I might buy again, but I will definitely be ordering 2 sizes larger, so it can be worn and washed more than once."
5,Long Johns,"Comfortable for the price, quick shipment. Like them very much to lounge in around the house."
3,poor overall quality,these are very basic quality and sizing runs super small so order your items larger than normal im a big man
4,Good book but cheaply made,"This was a great book if you want to learn about Pokemon in more detail, but the colours in it kinda...clash, and after about a month the pages started to fall out..."
5,Official Pokemon Handbook,Got this for my daughter who is 6..She loves all that is Pokemon..Book is very detailed and oriented towards geeks like my kids. I love it!
3,"Good, but too basic","This book is a must for beginning trainers. However, if you've mastered Pokémon as I and many others have, you will be paying money for information you already know. However, there's some interesting bits of trivia in here and the full colour art and pages make it a great book, nevertheless."
1,SUCKS!!!!!,2 words dude...IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!...its soooooo bad it deserves a -1 rating...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
4,In The Shadow of Suribachi,"The individual stories of these 7 young men are compelling in their own right. But when Ms Faulkner weaves their lives together through their training as Marines in Hawaii and into the battle at Iwo Jima, I felt I was with them every step of the way. A must read for anyone who has experienced war first hand; for all those who love and support them. and want to understand what it's really like."
3,Not really a novel about war,"This is definitely a different breed of cat. Ostensibly it is about Marines at war, specifically on Iwo Jima. But it is really about the aftereffects of being in such a hellhole and surviving, burdened with the memories from youth. For some unknown reason (I must not get the symbollism) the author spends the first half of the book showing a vignette from each Marine's past which in my small mind has no connection with the combat scenes. For example, one boy is at a circus fire. Another, steals a car. There is no character development once the Marine half of the book starts. Written by the daughter of a Marine haunted with memories of the horrors of Iwo, I can see the point she is trying to make but if you are looking for great firefights and lots of action, this is not the book for you."
4,Sweet book.,"This is a sweet book that has Barney share the difference between the crib and the ""big bed"". It serves its purpose to encourage the child to see that going to the big bed is a good thing. Not the best book on the subject but if they like Barney (and what child doesn't?)they will like this."
3,Peculiar Song Selection,"No Siberian Khatru, And You and I, but has Ritual from Topographic Oceans? Sound is well done but the song selection is sure weird."
1,Waste of money,"Bought the product for a 2000 Tracker. Says to test fit. Looked close so I started cutting only to find out that it is about 1/4"" too long to actually fit in the window. Not to mention the tape is on the WRONG SIDE !!!!! They have their little fine print that you cannot return them once it has been modified. Package said for 1999- 2004 tracker. I could not tell it would not fit prior to modifying because it has such a big lip on it. It looked as if it would fit. I did not even notice the tape was on the wrong side until I was working at trying to get the thing to fit. What a waste of money. Not to mention that I was led to believe I was ordering a ""Vent Shade"" brand product, which I have had great experience with, and got a Auto Ventshade instead....sort of like buying a Rolexx....."
2,Too Cheesy,"I love Dream Theater, but this just disappoints me. As someone said before me, this is way too 80s for me. Some highpoints of the album are Take the Time, Pull me Under, and Metropolis Part 1. The rest is basically cheesy filler. I hate Wait for Sleep, I can't stand Surrounded, and there's not much else on the album I can stand.For a proper introduction, try something like Train of Thought of you're a metalhead."
3,Some classic songs,"This release contains just too much keyboards. Many times they drown out the rest of the music, that's the only reason for the low rating. At times, they can get just down-right annoying! Other than that, this cd holds some absolutely fantastic songs. Dream Theater, even on their debut album, show some great melodies, heaviness and constant time shifts. The singer, LaBrie seems like a good combination of three singers: Freddie Mercury, Roy Khan(Kamelot), and maybe even a bit of Timo Kotipelto(Stratovarius). Interesting! Classic cuts on this album feature: ""Pull Me Under"" with its great choruses, ""Metropolis-Part I"" with its time shifts, ""Under a Glass Moon"" and ""Learning to Live."" Some good music."
3,GReat but...,"The general complain of those who don't like Dream Theater verym uch is that their music, altough viruoso and majestic and technically perfect, does not have bal...s, they are not rock.Unfortunately, I must agree with those critics.Petrucci's playing is soulless, but at least it's clear the guy can play anything. But greatest trouble is this singer, James LaBrie. God, he's utterly bad, a kind of Gary Cherone meets Elton John, something that awful!!! His voice is annoying, it's a shame to see four magic musicians having their work damaged by such an obnoxious voice. I know, he's in Dream Theater until today, but that not makes him any better, in my opinion.Get another singer, and IMAGES AND WORDS would have four stars from me."
5,My first DT album!,"This is the best album of 1992. This is my second DT album with SFAM my fvaorite. Songs like Metropolis Part 1, Learning to Live, Under A Glass Moon, and Pull Me Under are classics. Buy this along with SFAM and Awake for the best DT albums and best albums you'll ever hear. This album is very very recomended.My name is Ripper and I approve of this review."
2,Someone hire another singer!!!!,"James Labrie is a very lucky guy. Owner of a utterly bad, screaming, pop metal voice, he got a job working with some of the more talented, skilled and professional musicians around: Dream Theater.Labrie's voice alone makes the rating for this album drops drastically. To say h e has an ""operratic voice"" must be a bad joke... If you wanna hear ""operatic"", then go for Michael Kiske or Bruce Dickinson. If you wanna hear a metal singer knowing how and when to scream and use falsettos, go for Rob Halford. In short, go anywhere, except for James Labrie. The best parts of this album is when he keeps his mouth shut.The music is strong and complex as always is the case for Dream Theater. No matter how good it is, it's definitely not for any taste"
3,Dream Theater is a mixed bag.,"You can draw a line through this band - it's obvious what makes this band great, and also obvious what holds them back. On one side there is vast instrumental sections, highly developed understanding of music and theory, and a virtuoso's developed chops. On the other there is high whiny vocals that don't fit this band's style, pessimistic and uninspired lyrical content, and sometimes pretentious and unneeded solo sections. I suggest LIQUID TENSION EXPIRIMENT for all who like Dream Theater but, like me, had problems getting past these setbacks. The need to be heavy doesn't seem to be there, and the songs are shorter, and thought out well, no vocals to worry about, + ex Crimson bassist Tony Levin. You can bet it's good. I am not trying to downplay Dream Theater in any way; They are a great band. I have seen them live and witnessed firsthand their virtuosity, and I am only pointing out their disadvantages and what they need to work on."
4,A useful tool,Childrens Talking Dictionary is a useful tool to keep children learning in a fun way. Some kids don't want to learn because it seems like too much work. The talking dictionary makes it fun because it is a game. As a parent I even get stumped on some of the hangman solutions. The kids just love to see mom stumped. They need to know that even I don't always know everything.
1,Unsatisfactory,"It was almost impossible to install the batteries, the voice was not clear enough and the batteries went out way too quickly"
2,THIS ISNOT A DICTIONARY,"I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD FOR CHRISTMAS. IT TELLS YOU HOW TO SPELL A WORD, IT TELLS YOU HOW TO PRONOUCE IT IN SPANISH IF IT'S MALE/FEMALE ETC. BUT IT CANNOT BE USED AS A DICTIONARY TO TELL YOU THE MEANING OF A WORD. IT ONLY TOLD US THE DEFINATION OF 1 WORD OUT OF ALL THE WORDS WE ENTERED. WE HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER ITEM TO GET US WHAT WE WANT.PS-WE ALREADY OWN SEVERAL DICTIONARIES WE JUST WANTED SOMETHNG THAT WOULD HELP QUICKEN THE PACE WHILE DOING HOMEWORK."
4,great spelling and vocabulary tool,"Easy tool to use. My 7, 10, and 12 year old use it to check spelling and vocabulary. It has been very helpful and they were able to use it without reading the instructions!"
5,great tool for school,I bought this speller for my 5th grade son for Christmas and it is terrific. Not only does it help with spelling but it also gives my son definitions of the words. Even my 2nd grader loves it. Totally worth the money. Sorry I didn't get it earlier!
1,Im still a dummy,"Was not what I needed. This is one ""for dummies"" book that doesn't fit the bill. Apparently I an too much of a dummy for this book to even help."
4,Good review book,"This book is a great baseline to start your studies in preparation for the DAT. By no means does it do enough to prepare you using this alone. Coupled with practice tests and questions, it makes a great guide for studying."
4,Good trolling motor,"I bought mine used off craigslist, and had it for a couple years. The only issue I had was the tilt lever broke. It is a $2-3 part and fairly easy to replace though."
4,Works good...,Wanted a spare card drive for click! discs .... have 8-10 of these discs and lay with them from time to time... like old stuff ..... what can I say ... ???
5,Coming home after WWII,"I delayed seeing this film for years thinking it would be cloyingly sentimental. Was I wrong! This is a beautiful film. It tells the story of 3 servicemen coming home after the war and the adjustments they faced as they tried to resume life with their family, friends and employment. The pacing of the film is relaxing, allowing for ample character development. The viewer is willingly drawn into the film by such methods as real town street scenes taken from the taxi window as the men share their first ride home after years of being away and also by the use of a non-professional actor as one of the main characters. I am surprised the dvd didn't have any supplemental features regarding the making-of, etc. as this is a major American classic but maybe in the future. Highly recommended."
1,Booo!,Did not work right out of the box.No response from tech support by email.Tried to phone tech support 10 times on hold and never got through.Have been trying to obtain return authorization for two weeks without result.Could not be more dissatisfied with the product and with customer service.Booo!
2,Great design but firmware doesn't meet expectations,The latest firmware isn't working well with Rhapsody V.4.0. The issues all relate to Rhapsody's Digital Rights Management (DRM). The Rhapsody player updates the subscription tracks but the player doesn't recognize the update. There is no good fix for the issue. This has been a big dissapontment.
3,nice blades!,"lol, i bought this blades for my boyfriend's black and decker circular saw! until today they worked perfectly! he said "" this blades make a nice cut"" !"
5,Wow! Vocal excellence on a variety of styles.,"I love the diversity on this album - funky, rock, sultry, big band. The voices blend beautifully on all songs. My only complaint is that the video isn't included for Giving Him Something He Can Feel! That video was what made me buy the album - talk about sexy!!! Although I also enjoy the other songs/videos this song remains my favorite."
1,Poor timing,I have yet to receive this DVD. I ordered it on 9/2/05. It has now been a month and I have still not received this DVD. When can I expect to receive Lord Jim DVD?
4,pretty cool,"well my kids got them for christmas and they love it. dont even really think of this as book light as its primary function. it has an excellent dictionary, games, word scrambles and more. For the person who wants nothing to do w/ a game boy. my 12 year old daughter and 14 year old son love this..they can read and get definitions immediatly. Keeps my daughter occupied all over the place. I enjoy using it to waste time while in airports, road trips. Great find, bought one for sis in law. book lite function is okay other functions are great"
5,exceeded our expectations!,"Our 7th grader had his heart set on this, so despite the bad reviews we bought it.He loves it and uses it all the time during his reading.We haven't had any problems with it.Very pleased!"
2,Did not work,Did not work . The display was garbage and unreadable.10 or more words required is stupid.3 more words required
1,All keys didn't work on Pagemark Dictionary,"This product did not work. The dictionary's batteries were bad, leading and corroded. I replaced the old batteries and put in new AAA batteries. Afterwards the dictionary did turn on, but only 3 keys worked the letters w & e and space bar. For my experience this is a bad bookmark dictionary. I originally purchased it for my 6 year old who wanted a book mark with a dictionary. So I didn't want to invest that much money into this product, although now it looks like I will be paying a lot more money for a better working one. Perhaps it has worked for others, but I will not purchase another one from a different company."
5,The 2nd Best TNG episode (because part 2 is the best!),"Now how to explain the greatness of this episode without ruining the suspense for those who haven't seen it. Let's say this much - the borg are in it, which makes it good there. Now if you've seen episodes of Voyager or First Contact, these borg don't seem as rough looking or dangerous, but it's the same guys. This episode is filled with suspense and you'll love the ending. You'll want to see part 2 for sure and I'm not saying that just because it's only natural to watch a part 2."
5,As expected.,This battery did and does exactly what I expected it to do. It works great. What more can I say?
1,Save Your Money,Horrible. It died faster than the original that came with the drill.Save your money and go buy a new drill.
4,Olympus C-4040 Zoom,"Olympus has a winner on their hands (or in my hands). This camera takes crystal clear pictures in auto mode. Perfect for the intermediate digital photographer. Everything can be adjusted (with menus) and shots can be taken as close as 3 inches. For me, this was a great second camera on my journey to Digital SLR Heaven."
1,unfriendly for windows 98,"I bought the Camedia 4040zoom and was very excited about the features. The big problem was downloading the photos onto the computer. I read the manual - not enough information. I called customer service and was on hold for 47 minutes - no kidding! The rep was very helpful but had a hard time with this operation. We finally were successful in downloading the photos, but I lost them before I could save it and couldn't get it back. I went onto the on-line support and kept getting into a loop. Not successful. I am returning the camera and buying a Nikon that I borrowed from a friend and had no problem downloading the pictures."
2,Not good quality,"Bought this for my son's bed more as a decorative throw, rather than one to use as a blanket. It seems to more decorative anyway as it is not made for warmth. Within a few months the strings started unraveling and I was afraid to even touch it to fix it because everytime I did, it would unravel more. I threw it away. If you want to hang this on a wall, it may work. But not made for a bed."
4,Almost perfect book for beginner,"This is a wonderful book that is the first in the ""Build a Metal Working Shop From Scrap"" series. It goes over basic foundry processes and materials and finally the building and operation of a Charcoal fired furnace for melting aluminum. I built a furnace out of a garbage can from this book, but I haven't fired it yet. Unfortunately, the charcoal burns with a lot of smoke and there are a lot of ashes left over when you are done. Even with the disadvantages of the dirtyness, it is easier to work with than gas."
5,Great Household Helper,"Very powerful and helful around the house. The attachments are large and you will need the smaller set of tools for cleaning in small areas like your car etc.The tool holder is pretty much useless to me, because the tools don't fit properly and honestly if it didn't have to be on the vacuum for the wheels I wouldn't have it on mine."
4,"Lots of likes, but it is HUGE!","We were really in need of a shop vac. I saw this had great ratings and it was a blower too. So I figured it was worth a shot. I love it! The only thing I don't like is how big it is, so it is hard to move around and carry. It does the job!"
3,Good.... Not great but good,"I liked the way this book flowed for the most part, it is an easy read. I thought it might be hard to get into this book but it really wasn't hard at all. I would say this book is good not great but good."
2,Quite overrated,"I am a fan of most of Kallmaker's earlier work, but it seems like her more recent books are getting thicker and thicker... with details I don't really care for. I think it's great that the author is doing her homework and researching the careers that she is writing about, but I really don't think that the majority of the book should be about it! To give you an idea of how much of this extra boring detail there is, the two main characters don't even meet until halfway into the book! I like a story where the focus is on the two main characters, their feelings and reactions to each other. There is very little of that here and I was rather disappointed. If I went through the book fast it was because I was speeding through the mundane day-to-day anguish that both characters are going through. I enjoy character interaction, not prolonged pain and suffering."
5,My First Lesbian Read,"I loved watching Holly grow into herself, leaving her controlling relationship with a man and realizing her attraction to women, experiencing her first kiss and the awakening of real passion for the first time. I couldn't wait for Holly and Reyna to finally come together. I too am realizing my growing attraction exclusively to women, and this was my first Lesbian read. I recommend this book to anyone going through similar internal struggles; Holly realizing an attraction for women and Reyna's struggles with her parents, to please one in order to protect another, while sublimating her own desires. I look forward to more Kallmaker and more stories of growth and love."
4,Useful,"About half of this book seems devoted to astrological uses and methods of prediction and the I Ching. The first half is a good review of alternative means of divination, including the plum blossom oracle. A very useful book for those interested in the many alternatives to the coin and yarrow stick methods of divination."
3,Quite upset...,"Be careful who you order this from (oc_media)! Great classic game, I was really looking forward to getting it. It would have help to pass the time here in Afghanistan...HOWEVER!! I never got my order, and had to threaten to file a claim with Amazon to get a response/refund! They said it had shipped, and then later (after ""refunding"", still haven't seen it) said that it was ""out of stock"". Sounds fishy to me...Out of stock is a HUGE difference from ""it shipped on the June 5th""...Regardless of some of the incompetent store fronts on this site, this game truly is a must have! If I find it somewhere else that isn't going to try to rip me off, I'll definitely pick it up."
5,"First Review was James Levine Gala, not 25th Anniversary Met","My first/former review applies to the James Levine Gala, not the Met's 25th anniversary Gala, which was not missing anything. The Met 1983 Centennial and 25th Anniversary are absolutely required if you love opera even a little. This is a truly great evening featuring Freni and Domingo in one act of Zeffirelli's Otello, Pavarotti and Studer in one act of Rigoletto and too many international stars in concert to mention. This is very highly recommended!!! You'll watch it many, many times!"
2,I LOVE THIS CD but the mp3 version does not allow me to burn a CD,"I cannot play this in my stereo CD player or car. I was trying to replace a CD we lost in a fire, and i am disappointed. :-/"
4,My boy asks for it; what better recommendation than that?,"My son loves to pick his own book to read. He does this by saying ""no"" alot until I pick up the book he wants. The Magic Hat tends to be the book he wants.He likes the rhyme, and so do I. It's fun and repetitive, which helps him to learn what to say next (if he's going to help me read it...).The illustrations are wild and messy and fun. All the girls are in dresses and the old men are fat and colorfully attired.It's a fun story with a whole lot of magic in it.This is a loved book in this house."
5,More Mem Magic,"One in a long line of irresistible Mem Fox titles, The Magic Hat is a delightfully simple book, which my kids love already (after just two days)."
5,Long time use of Greenplug with old fridge,"I started using the Greenplug with an old fridge back when it first came out, both the plug and the old fridge have run quietly together for many many years (10+?). I put it on another old fridge and metered it and it draws less volts and watts but runs a longer cycle - but thats what it is supposed to do - like driving a steady 50 rather than 75 and then braking!"
5,Genius design for affordable housing,"I first read a library copy in the early 80's and used some of the author's excellent ideas to design a tiny owner-built (16' square) cube cabin, which I love.The book details such a clean and efficient design, many more people should know about it. I was reminded of it (noticing that it has other enthusiastic supporters) again recently in a newsgroup thread about affordable and modular housing.I'm currently re-reading is the same library copy, now badly worn, its useful life near the end. I have no idea where Leslie Armstrong is these days, or why the book is out of print, but here's another call to republish her important work."
4,Numerical Recipes in C,"It thought the book contained a lot of useful subroutines that belong in any programmer's bag of tricks. It was somewhat dense to read, some of the subroutines need to be debugged; but, all-in-all, a very useful and educational book."
3,The essentials,"I ordered this product after the frustration of working with more touristy language learning systems. Russian is hard to learn and right now I need to focus on learning to communicate with our child. This is a great product because it gives you the basics necessary for communicating with your child. The only downfall is that it goes by fast. Each word or phrase is only said two times and then moves on to the next word. I enjoy the phrase book that came with the CD, and think it will be very useful during our travels."
1,damn wrong investition !!!,"What can I say, the worst way to spent money for something that have to look nice and natural, this eyelashes are something 100% oposite of that !!! Like it's told in the product's name: FALSE FAKE - that's the only truth about this...!!!"
3,thanks,I been trying to find the ones of real human hair !!! this ones are ok but a bit hard or stiff !! but any way they do a good job
5,Great video for elementary kids.,"I am a former school resource officer. This video is great for showing in classrooms of elementary-aged students. Retro Bill keeps things moving at a fast pace and it is edited like a live-action cartoon with fun music, so it keeps the students' attention. My daughter has watched this video many times at home on her own. One of the best videos for different safety tips for kids."
4,Paramours and internal politics.,"Engrossing inside stuff. Strong on all JFK's paramours and sturdy history of the big events; ex, Bay of Pigs, Missile Crisis. The sections about Jackie, particularly redecorating the White House might more likely be skimmed over by the boys."
5,good deal,Shipped in fast to me. Very Good CD. Good condition. Very funny. Exactly what I expected it to be.George when George was still very funny and very clever. Brought back memories of my youth.
2,A little *too* insider.,"Warning: this is not a book for someone who just wants to put up a new set of blinds in the kitchen, or needs someone to paint their guest room. A lot of the service providers listed work with the trade only (practically all the upholsterers, for example), which I think limits the book's usefulness to anyone who doesn't have a professional decorator (who will have contacts of their own, surely?). I'm not sure who this book is supposed to be for, but it's definitely not for the average apartment dweller or small homeowner."
5,Great set of bits ana a great price.,I've used this set for a couple of years now. All the bits seem to hold up just fine for the way I use them. Just bought the exact same set for my son who recently purchased a home and now needs his own set. Especially nice is the quick-connect adapter.
3,"Like the case, bits are only okay","I had a case like this that I used for years, until I left it on the back of the truck and lost it on the road somewhere. Couldn't find an exact replacement, so I ordered this. I like having a variety of bits in a soft case, but the primary wood bits are on the cheap side. One of the larger ones broke the first time I used it. Quick connect attachment is nice, but not very helpful since most drills don't require chuck keys anymore anyway. But it adds some length when I need it. Spade bits, concrete bits, and screwdriver tips are standard quality.Wish I still had my old set. That was a 5 star loss."
2,not worth the money,i broke almost everyone of these drill bits they do not work very well at all. for the same price you can get a better set dont waste your time with these. the only reason i bought these was because i liked the case they came in other then that theyre garbage.
4,Nice set,I got this for my husband for Christmas as an addition to a beginning tool collection. Has come in good use a few times we have needed.
3,"Cheapest 64 MB out there, but not great","It's cheap and it works, but the display seems rather dark compared to even my older card, and gameplaying can be somewhat choppy, even for games which require only 32MB. It's probably worth paying a little more for a better card."
2,Poor customer service,"I recently ordered a DVD from Overman2000 and although there was nothing wrong with the package, I needed to return the item because I chose the wrong shipping method. I wrote the vendor a couple times asking for the return address policy and information and nobody ever wrote me back.....I am extremely disappointed at the poor customer service from this vendor. Be careful if you buy from this Overman2000...they won't let you send anything back."
2,One great song is not enough.,"Clutch's _Transnational Speedway League_ starts out with a considerable bang. ""A Shogun Named Marcus"" is one of the greatest heavy rock songs of the 1990s, and is probably the best song that this admittedly talented band will ever write. One of the great sing-along choruses in the history of the heavy rock and a driving musical force that will not be denied. _TSL_ is probably worth picking up used just for this song alone, IMHO.The problem is that the rest of this album just does not measure up. It's as uneven as the numbers 7 and 15. While ""Marcus"" is a stronger song than any of the tunes on their later album _Clutch_, that album, as a complete work of art, absolutely destroys _TSL_. Get that one first.2 stars only for the formidable ""Marcus""."
1,This album Stinks,The lead singer of this band sounds like he has 20 cigarettes in his mouth. I think the music is okay but I cannot stand the lead singer.
1,Not A Good Buy.,"When i recived it in the mail (1-2 days) i opened it and as soon as i turned the V pod on, the screen lit up, but it showed no menu or song selecting screen. i tried everything but it didint work.I also followed the directions to raise the volume, but i still can barely hear it in the car. I suggest you buy a differint mp3 or mp4 player. If i'm doing something wrong or if theres a way to e-mail the merchant of this item, please tell me."
4,V-POD REVIEW,"I disagree with the only other review for the V-Pod. The Volume range is quiet to very loud and the controls are easy to use.The video screen is clear.The appearance is very nice and it has some pretty cool features like radio, video and mic.The weight is nice also.There are two features I don't like.One is that the headphones ""in"" jack is smaller than normal jacks preventing use of other headphones at least with out an adapter and the jack is on the side rather than the top or bottom which makes armband mounting ackward. Second, while in ""music"" mode, scanning through music files doesn't appear to be as user friendly as the IPOD but I have only owned the VPOD for one day and have more investigating to do. Over all I think this is a good buy."
1,Very Bad Quality Product,This product has no brand at all. The menu did not work after 3 weeks of use. I do not recommend this product at all.
2,"Works, But...","This product had so many corners cut in its production that its longevity should be measured in months, not years. When a company like Apple gets a product down to what seems a reasonable price, watch out. Many of these devices develop problems; others don't. Treat them with care and you should get your money out of them. Investing in a Sandisk Sansa is probably a better way to go.This device also relies on playlist file transfer. It's a pain to load up with your own music. I'd rather be able to use it as a drag and drop player. It's a matter of forcing the stupid masses into doing what's best for them."
1,This is bad,these are made as bootlegs in hong kong and are sold to the sellers for 22 dollars each I bought these there hoping to get a good deal for gifts for all my friends but none of them work properly. useless dont get them
1,Vidio Player,I purchased 3 units. had to send one back for replacement and now 2 months later 3 out of the total of 4 are bad and not working.
2,You get what you pay for,"I thought perhaps all MP3 players were the same. This thing has lots of menu functionality that does not work. It plays music, but there arent many playability options. Next time I'll get an iPod."
4,Pretty good,"I liked this book a lot. I liked the characters and how the plot developed. The reason for four stars instead of five, towards the end it did get a little slow. I hope these characters show up in another book."
2,"Flimsy, breakable, but cute","I've been using this coffee maker for less than a week. It's cute, shiny, and looks very nice on the counter. It makes good coffee. It's simple to use. BUT....This morning, I made coffee as usual, flipped the switch and after a few seconds, the carafe went *pop*, cracked and coffee went all over the counter. I can't find a replacement carafe that fits, because of the awkward shape. I was using plain tap water, not cold water, so there was no rapid temperature change that would explain the cracking. Just crappy construction.I spent $40 for a week of coffee and now I have to buy another pot. What a waste."
1,"Looks nice, poor quality","When I opened the box up and looked carefully I could see this was a very cheap machine. The glass was so very thin. The plastic was thin, too. The coffee it made was okay, no problem there. It worked for about a month and it went dead. This item should cost about ten dollars, certainly not the 40 plus I paid for it. One should be able to get a fairly well made coffee maker for forty to fifty dollars. Buy something else."
2,Weaksauce,"I wanted my first thermometer to be my last, meaning that I wanted one that would last. I never set this one in the dishwasher, nor did I ever get the top (digital) part of the thermometer very wet--in fact I tried to keep it dry. However, it crapped out on me after less than 20 uses.Based on other reviews, I'm not going to waste my time trying to return it. I'm getting a new one from another company, and you should too."
1,Failed after first use; warranty service nonexistent.,"This thermometer's numerical display failed after its first use when I hand-washed it. The package stated ""dishwasher safe"" so I have no idea what happened. Mailed it to the Polder address printed on the package with a letter of explanation and the original receipt but received no response. Waited about 8 weeks to give them time to respond then emailed an inquiry. Again no response. Polder clearly couldn't care less about customer service or the quality of their products. I'm out the price of the thermometer plus time and cost to return it. You have nothing to lose by buying another brand."
1,you wrong for this diddy,cassie sucks really she does we all know who she slept with to get a recod deal don't we diddy.
4,"""Super hot""",it's now wonder why superstar singer and model Mario wanted 2 star Cassie in his new single! meet Bad Boy co.'s newest creation with her summer smash Me & U Cassie is destined 4 greatness!
3,"A soft singer for a younger audience, or for those not in the mood for belting","Ok, I am not in disagreement with any of you who are not thrilled with Cassie's undeveloped vocal skills, or her extremely soft style over whatalmost seems like overwhelming music tracks. She is another singer who can thank Janet Jackson for making soft, unchallenging singing a style all its own. It is good when you are in the mood for low key, gentle music. It also appeals greatly to a younger audience who is not turned on to mature voices like Mary J. Blige, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and other heavily gospel influenced r & b singers. I like this album whenI am too burned out to listen to powerhouse divas. ""About time"",""Just OneNight"", and ""Not With You"" especially sound like they might have beenJanet Jackson songs when she was close to Cassie's age. Anyway, being that the vocals and the music is very light and spare, save it for whenyou are in the mood, and you'll find it pleasant."
2,it's ok.....,"overall it's oki only bought this cd b/c of the songs ""me&u;"" and ""long way to go"" which are the best songs on this cd. the lyrics are immature and all the other songs are pretty much the same......maybe she'll grow up with time and bring something better to the table but for now, if i were u, i wouldn't waste my money on this cd"
3,She is okay...,"This is definitely a easy listening album. What I mean is that you can't take her seriously. She has a candy coated voice that is cute. I like Me and U because it is a head bobbng song...it is also kind of dark. I like Long way to go...simply for the beat...it is like a trance hip hop song. I love just one night. Those are the only songs I like on this album. The other songs don't even fit her weak voice. Oh and for the record...the girl cannot perform live at all...period!! Just from that performance on 106 and park you know that she is a studio singer. What makes me mad the most is that Diddy put Danity Kane through the mill...totaly dissing them and working them out to a pulp. Why did someone like Cassie slip through and she is not polished at all? She can't dance, has weak vocals, and is a weak presence on stage. So sad..."
5,Good Quality!,Fax/Copier is in excellent condition! It has to be brand new but was advertised as being a used model! Just my good fortune! Am Happy!
1,Never worked!,I set this machine up exactly how it said but it NEVER WORKED. All it kept saying was that it was trying to connect. I let my dad take it apart (since he's always curious about machines) and then i threw it out. Not even worth the trouble to return it.
2,communication error,"This machine needs improving. Most of the time, I get communication errors or poor line condition if the receiving side has a bit of noise on the line. Then, it auto prints a report stating the problem which is a waste of paper because you see the error on the display screen. Very confusing to use. I would not recommend it."
3,Stevie Nicks is always #1,"I know Street Angel is not the best. There were alot of problems in producing this album.Stevie had to let go her original producer and get a new one.The original producer had this laid out for the Album : No Waddy Watchel,no percussion,and country like vocals.When Stevie let him go she did put perscussion on it,but was ready to just get the album and didn't fool with the vocals,she regrets this now.My fav. song on this album is ""Blue Denim"" I also like ""Destiny"" and ""Rose Garden"",I know Stevie has a new album planned for release sometime in 1999,called ""Trouble in Shangri-La"",it's not going to be like Street Angel.I could only give this 3 stars because simply It's a good album,but the worst she's ever made.We will always love Stevie and her music,even if you messes up with an album. GO STEVIE!!~Chris~"
3,Mixed Feelings about Street Angel,"This album was so-so. I got this in a Boston record store, and paid, like, $3.50, for it, and that is probably all it's worth. This takes away from the strong hard rock of Stevie's records, and gives an unorganized country feel. If you're a Stevie fan, you may like this, if you're a Fleetwood fan, you probably will not care for this, and if you like country music, this may appeal to you, but it's a little poorly written, so maybe not."
3,Good Translation... Okay Story,"I have read many versions of this book, and this has got to be the best translation by far. However, I find the story lacking in several points. One, there is no concrete story line, Don Quioxte and his ""squire"" Sancho, seem to wander about the countryside aimlessly. I know many people that have really loved this book, however I was happy to see the end. The best part of the story is the many short stories within the main story told by traveler the wandering knight meets during his journey. Overall, I thought that this book was worth reading only to add to your bank of knowledge to works of Miguel de Cervantes. If you do wish to do that, then this the best translation I have seen."
5,This is Such a wonderful Translation!,"This is the only one that brings the story TO LIFE! I played Aldonza in the musical , and this book helped me so much! Michelle Grossman is owed a great deal of praise for her work here! She has done all these characters proud!"
5,For Heaven and Dulcinea,"I must commend Grossman on her excellent translation of Cervantes classic, ""Don Quixote"". By far, her work is superior to other renditions of this novel including Starkie's because the literature flows better and her words/translation only adds to the story instead of cluttering the pages with small unimportant details.If your going to read one of the greatest novels ever written, read the Grossman translation and you will enjoy it much more."
3,Important Literature...,"I must apologize in advance for giving such an important work of literature 3 stars. This book is unquestionably one of the greatest works of literature. I have no criticism for the book in that regard.This book was entertaining at times and very innovative. It was full of humor, drama, and bits of wisdom. However, it left me bored after the first few hundred pages. I kept with the book to the end, but it was hard to keep trucking since it seemed to be much of the same thing over and over again. Also, I ended up enjoying Don Quixote's sidekick, Sancho Panza more that Don Quixote himself. This is definitely one case where I'd recommend an abridged version over the full version. For this book, there is no need to read the full 940 pages as half that much would do the trick."
4,Muy Bien!,"I really enjoyed reading the book Don Quixote. The plot seemed to move along nicely and there weren't too many dull moments. At times, Miguel de Cervantes would detail certain events a little bit too much and they got a bit lengthy, but the book itself was great. Each quest that Don Quixote embarks on is origional and entertaining, and Sancho, his trusty sidekick, is there to fish Don Quixote out of any predicament he may have gotten himself into. This book is for those with a good imagination and sense of humor. I highly reccommend it!"
1,Mildewed Don Quixote,The book looks lovely and new but it was stored prior to shipping in a humid environment and smells strongly of mildew. Makes it tough to read and I certainly won't keep it around even if I manage to finish reading it. Not happy that I was sent a mildewed book.
3,"Beginnings, Middles & Ends","As a writer to be and looking for light at the end of a dark tunnel this book gave me some good food for thought. However it was too wordy and no illustrations. Also the examples chosen to illustrate important points were repeated time and time again to the point where I lost interest in reading the very text that is meant to be a helper in my writing challenges.More illustrations, more examples from top writers would have helped. Short stories cannot ignore writers like Edgar Allan Poe etc."
5,How to turn an okay manuscript into a winner,"I read this book when I was revising a manuscript. Nancy Kress shows how to make all the parts of a novel connect to provide a satisfactory reading experience. Her section on endings was particularly strong, and helped to transform my last page from merely so-so to five paragraphs that sum up the message of the story in a powerful and readable piece of exposition and dialogue. This book is ideal if your unruly story is escaping from your control, or if it doesn't deliver its message with the power you know it could. Helpful for the beginning novelist who needs assistance shaping a story as well as for the experienced novelist who wants to increase his or her mastery in the craft of writing."
4,Big help,This book I read in christmas and it has been a very good help for me to write the end of a book I am working with. In fact if you write a beginning you have the end. That's what the books says. Now I have given the book to two in my writing group and they also think it is excellent. I never saw any other book on this subject.
2,Moving the handle is almost impossible!,"For our second child we bought this car seat (previously had a Graco) to fit into the matching Sit N Stand double stroller. Wish I found another seat that also fits, even if it won't be the same color. Great safety ratings, the triangle handle looks weird but I thought was comfortable, and easy to clean. However, it is very difficult to move the handle back (which you're supposed to do for safety) once you put the baby in the car. It takes a few tries to get it to move and is a real hassle. The strap length isn't very long either and my baby only weighs 13 pounds.I agree with other reviewers and would not buy this again despite the convenience of fitting well with my new carriage by the same brand (which I love and highly recommend)."
2,Bottom rusts and it doesn't allow roll to rotate,"Overall, not something I'd buy again.Pros:- inexpensive- looks niceCons:- the bottom has gotten what appears to be rust on it, and seems to have left stains on the countertop- because of the diameter of the holding rods, the paper towel rolls I buy don't rotate"
4,base is not very sturdy,very nice looking but the base is not very sturdy. you have to hold tightly onto it at the top when tearing off a sheet.
5,"Looks great, works well, matches my banana holder","Bought this once I received my Euro Chrome banana holder. Had to upgrade! Looks great together. Sturdy, simple design, looks great on my counter, gives me good access to my paper towels."
4,compact and reliable,"I work internationally and decided to take a Spanish class at the local college. I needed a dictionary, verb book .... so I wanted something that I could fit in my briefcase. This does the job and then some. It has a plastic cover to protect the face/screen, more words they I need (some complain that these portable devices don't have a large enough vocabulary), conjugates verbs, word list, spelling games and more. A very very important feature is the AAA battery. I have another one that takes the CR type (not common) and needed to replace in Argentina and could not find them in the stores near the hotel. Lastly, for those that say the vocabulary is limited, they are clearly beyond the 4-5 million words covered. It does not cover slang or profane language, but then again, how many dictionaries cover that (not the pocket type)?"
2,Disappointing,"A neat package that suffers from diminutive size. This dictionary is small. Buttons are too small; screen font is too small, even with adjustable font some on screen displays are unaffected. Navigation arrows are not intuitively placed, and a nuisance to use. Older machine that this replaced was far better; had a nice big screen font, easy to read; nice big buttons, intuitively placed navigation arrows. Device now sits in a drawer; got a nice Spanish-English dictionary from the dollar store!"
1,I returned this item,"Screen was very hard to read. I returned this item. Be careful when ordering it. Returns to this company, which isn't Amazon, are only allowed on defective items. I returned the item a month ago and still haven't received a refund."
3,not sure yet,"I really like the content of this thing so far, but the problem is that I usually use it outdoors, and you can barely read it there, for some reason. I thought the battery was low after I tried to use it in my car, which is where I listen to my Spanish lessons. However, when I took it indoors and turned it on before replacing the battery, it was nice and bright there and easy to read again. Then back out in the car, later that day, I can't read the screen AT ALL. Not sure what the problem is, but so far I don't see a button or option to alter the screen to make it more visible."
5,Outstanding Movie,"I believe we got the last set of DVDs available of this movie and we're glad we did. This was a replacement for the VHS tapes we made when the mini-series first aired on TV in 1982. The tapes are still okay, but the DVD is much better plus we don't have all the commercials. They said it was used once, but it's the same as brand new. It was hard to find in NTSC (U.S.) format, so we were lucky. There are several of this same version available in the European PAL format, but you can't play them on American equipment. Hopefully, this same provider (Table 42) will be able to get some more DVDs of this movie because it's well worth having. They said it had Chinese subtitles which can be turned off. Whoever played it first apparently turned them off because we never saw them, so that was not a problem. The movie covers the life of Marco Polo in fascinating and entertaining detail with an excellent cast of characters. At almost 8 hours long, it keeps you glued to the TV throughout."
3,Marco Polo Mixed Bag,"I loved Marco Polo when it came out on television in 1982. When I found this on Amazon I was thrilled and I watched it as soon as it arrived. I am very happy to at last have my own copy at a very reasonable price but am throughly disappointed with the video quality or better said, the lack of video quality. The sound and music are fine as far as I can tell. But the picture is dark without proper contrast. Across my screen I can see what appears to be, for lack of a better term, a ""dirty screen"" with black ""debris"" that obscures the film and darkens it. If I did not want to have my own copy so badly I would have returned it. I wonder if this is a bad DVD or if all are the same. I would love to have a first class DVD, which is what I expected, instead of what I received. If I could swap it out with the supplier for a good copy I would do it in an instant. What should I do? Tman"
4,Purchased for bird house building,"I bought this drill bit set so I could work on building a small bird house for my yard. I have not used all of the bits but I was satisfied with the quality of the hole the bit put in the wood. The variety of bit sizes is nice, too."
4,Very funny.,"This movie is very funny. Shirly Brener is hillarious as the lead. Very creative and original storyline, you wont be able to predict what happens next."
3,Get A More Thorough Dictionary,"I had to get this dictionary for my Hindi class, but I would definitely get a more thorough one if you can. This has basic words, but after you get past what you ate for lunch and how many shirts you own, you're going to need more complex words. This is a great tool for beginners, so you might want to buy it along with a more intense dictionary or something."
2,Beware of this edition,Beware of this edition of the DVD. There is another edition with a much fancier cover that has exactly the same disc inside but it sells for $6.99 which is a fair price for a documentary that adds some previously unseen footage but is definitely not worth the price of $29.95.Wings Over Water
3,I really expected......,".....a bit more from Mr. Bella than a ""B"" grade type movie. The only thing this has in common with Mr. Poe is the title and Mr. Dupin."
4,creative no-bake ideas for things made out of cookies,"This is a guidebook to projects using store bought cookies and other items. There are projects such as ""gingerbread"" houses made from graham crackers and other store bought items. No baking is required for these projects, making them suitable for schools or preschools that can't or don't want to do everything from scratch. For anyone who wants to do things from scratch, you can use these plans and substitute homemade gingerbread forms.There are projects of houses and castles, and vehicles such as trains and fire trucks, and covered wagons. There are whimsical creations such as spectacles, luggage, Irish hat, parasol and baseball cap. There are 44 projects in all. Some projects are related to holidays such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.This is a great idea-stimulator. The directions are clear and easy to follow. Since it is out of print, you may want to check your local library to see if they have a copy (mine does)."
4,Don't walk into a dealership unprepared.,"I keep this book as a reference in my personal library. The invoice formulas are very helpful.I walked into the Mercedes-Benz dealership knowing the maximum amount I was going to spend for a C230 Kompressor in July 2000, that's empowerment.I want to sell this car and get a 2003, E320 or E500. I checked the Kelly's Blue Book and my car's valuation is $1800 higher (before taxes) than what I paid for it 2 years ago! I expect to just about break even when I sell my current car in August.A negative note: The author is very repetative and (in every chapter) he constantly reminds you that all car salesmen are the lowest form of theives. I can put up with that, though, because the book worked for me. It's better than walking into a showroom nave and unprepared."
3,Interesting...,"I like 'Joy of Moly' better, probably because I find the lyrics on this album weak and distracting. But the guitar work, synthetic sounds and biting bass make the instrumentals come alive, and the lyricless vocals are interesting. The freewheeling melody lines - you never quite know which way the guitar line is going to weave, but it always makes perfect sense - make the album a keeper. I usually cut tracks 2 & 3 from the playlist.I wish ""Into the Wood"" had been recorded in 5.1 sound - that could have been fascinating."
1,Study of Star Trek Autographs,"There is so much more to know and write on this subject. The author barely scratches the surface of what can and should be told. Because of the lack of information, the author uses full pages to illustrate a single item, apparently just to take up space. Much more can be leared by just attending a few Star Trek events and talk to reputable dealers. Some of the illustration are simply a self promotion."
2,Tasteless,...Organic does not have to mean tasteless. Even vegans deserve a heartier stew that this bit of gibberish. Better take some trouble and cook black bean stew proper.
5,"Pretty,pretty, pretty good!","Larry David, co-creator of SEINFELD, now stars in his own series. The humor is so good , it hurts! Also, the language has no censorship, which adds to the hysterics. Like Seinfeld, if you're a fan like I am, you can watch the episodes again and again without getting tired of them. Another star offering from Amazon!"
3,Coby CT-P8600,Not a bad phone with the exception of no mute button for either the speaker phone or handheld. For me that was an important feature which I unfortunately overlooked when I purchased it
2,Drops incoming calls,"The design and features of this phone aren't bad. It seemed like a good value at the time. But having had it for a while now I've become dissappointed. The sound quality is not very good. Sound is not clear with a constant background hissing static. And the volume is low even at max volume. But the most significant problem with this phone is that it drops about 30-40% of the incoming calls when you answer them. You press the button to answer and the handset starts searching for the base unit, dropping the call. Problem exists on all my handsets. Will not buy VTech again, as I've heard others complain of same problem."
2,Who's Zooming Who?,"Anyone who has read or has any experience with incest knows that this type of behavior repeats itself from one generation to the next. Dr. West points out early in his book that this was what in fact happened to him, i.e., grandmother, mother, him. And according to this book his wife has 14+ years working with sexually-abused children. So what I can't figure out is why these two adults find no problem with the fact that after mommy goes to work, daddy jumps in his son's bed for a half hour to read(?) And when daddy's taking a bath in Mr. Bubble or (probably a much more expensive bath additive that mommy has bought in order to coddle one of daddy's child alters) mommy has no problem plunking the kid in there with him. And yet-------she won't let daddy play Monopoly with their son because she's afraid one of daddy's child alters will come out to play mid-game. This just doesn't make any sense to me. Am I the only reader who was troubled by this dangerous inconsistency?"
4,a story of an ordinary man living an extraordinary life,Dr. West makes it possible to feel the day to day struggles of a multiple...not appearing as an aborration but as a fellow human with an extaordinary personality....
5,SPELLBINDING--I CAN PUT ANY BOOK DOWN--BUT NOT THIS ONE,"I haven't even finished this book yet and I am so excited about it that I have to tell everyone. This is a remarkable story that is wonderfully written in an honest, straightforward and endearing manner. You get pulled right into this family's life. The first few chapters have enough fast paced material to fill an entire book on its own. The most incredible part is that it is TRUE. Thank you, Cameron, for sharing your story and helping to educate us about your illness."
2,Not a Must-Read,"I found this book a difficult read. The writing was very choppy, which caused me to wonder if perhaps if the various personalities were constantly interrupting each other as the paragraphs were written. I'm sure in other hands, this book would make an excellent story."
1,Worst book ever read on Multiple Personality disorder,I'm not going to waste much time on this book review except to say that of all the books I've read on this disorder this one is the worst.This guy comes across as a total jerk and I think this book is a fake. I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan.
1,Frustrated,Wanted to surprise my husband for Christmas. Good thing I tried it first. While loading it flashes back to desktop.My celeron 533 should have played it.
5,Handwriting analysis book,"Absolutly marvelous! It's a complete very well explained book for beginners, I loved it andI'm not a beginner."
4,lot of haters bumpin their gums,"this album is pretty good dispite the haters leaving feedback.when i was in school in 92 this was a dope album. i still have it and it gets play from time to time. i'm not a huge reggae fan (just like shaggy, maxi preist & snow)."
3,Thats a start,"He's like the Canadian version of brad from sublime. He cant sing as nice and instead of a punk influence, he has r&b.Instead of KRS1 he has MC Shan( KRS1s old rival.) He should stop trying to be Jamaican though.He can rap fast and has cool beats though. But then again, the fact that his ""dancehall"" beats aren't really dancehall doesnt help. I do reccommend this cd, though, 'cause it was great for its time."
4,Really worth what you pay,The tuner works great for how cheap it is. The only problem i ever had was it sometimes thought the string i was tuneing was the string above or below it but for under 10$ when some tuners can cost 30 it is worth a few kinks i lost this tuner asnd i am going to buy the same one again i reccomend it to anyone
5,great item,"well, this is going to be the third time im buying one of these. i broke and i lost my second one. there is a reason why im buying this item a third time, and thats because it is great. it has helped me write dozens of papers and essays. the thesaurus is great and it has contains extensive vocabulary. in addition the games keep me fairly entertained during never ending classes and lectures. another great plus to this dictionary thing is that, whenever a professor or teacher asks you a question, you dont have to look stupid to them because you can quickly look it up in this thingy. a great idea would be to install the brittania encyclopedia chip into the dictionary thingy. its a great addition to it. i am purchasing another one of those chip thingies too, because they are a great help."
5,Profound,"This book presents a fascinating point of view of the human psyche, a view that is totally unlike anything else I have ever encountered. Samael Aun Weor sees the human mind from a perspective that is but fresh and disturbing, and he helps the reader to see that we are not what we think we are. This book is for serious students of the Science to Awaken the Consciousness."
1,Planetary? Yes. Romance? No.,"This novel was very disappointing. The author showed some creativity with respect to the world of Paragaea, but in most other respects the work was unsatisfactory. The characters were wooden, the prose uninspired. I see that the publisher compares this work to that of Burroughs and Brackett, but those authors (in addition to creating exotic planetary scenery) could TELL A GOOD STORY. Here, I guarantee most readers will lose interest in these characters about halfway through the story. That's just as well because ultimately the author leaves most of these largely unsympathetic characters into dead ends, and unresolved or unconvincing conclusions."
3,"Good, but maybe not best for dogs with sensitivites","We fed our English bulldog this food for the first month after we got him (at 7 months old). While he didn't have any serious problems, we noticed his stool was consistently soft. We did a lot of reading about how bulldogs are often sensitive to chicken, grains, etc and switched him to Nature's Variety Instinct salmon formula. His stool/digestion has been very solid on the new food, and his yeast/skin issues seem to have improved somewhat. The ingredients seem to be high quality, but may not be the best choice for dogs with digestive sensitivities."
1,A windblown exposition of a trivial concept.,"It's well known in computer design that a NOR gate is all that's necessary to implement all other logic functions. Brown develops a simple notation to express NOR and the logic states 0 and 1. Complicated logic expressions converted to their NOR equivalent and expressed in this simplified notation become very malleable. You only have to remember a few simplification rules and frequently the answer is available through simple substitution. I can't draw his notation, but the idea is: Let ""(A B)"" represent NOR(A,B), """" = 0 and ""()"" = 1. The cute part is letting empty space represent 0 and the application of NOR to empty space as 1."
5,Clean humor,"This book is really funny. Some of the puns are a little silly, but some of the jokes, which can be conveniently read to others, made me laugh until I cried.Since the publisher is Scholastic, Inc., you can assume the book is targeted for school children, a group in which I cannot now claim membership. As an adult, with my mate and I reading the jokes to each other, I had a real good time laughing. Of course, teachers could read them to their classes or have class members read them.The one about the travel company, Smith, Smith, Smith & Smith, was the funniest of all, I thought.Try it. You'll like it. Diximus."
4,A Great Idea!!,"The idea behind this unit is great and should have been made available a long time ago. The vacuum part is so powerful that it is almost dangerous. It will suck up anything in its path with lightning speed (be careful if you have laundry hanging in the basement). The pump also works well, once you get it primed. That is the only major problem with this unit. Once there is water in the tank it can be somewhat frustrating trying to get the pump started. It takes a few trys, but the end result is well worth it. Just be careful, the vacuum works faster than the pump can discharge, so you have to stop picking up the fluid occasionally to give the pump a chance to catch up."
4,Great tanks,"I like this ww2 tank arcade, and it's a good game for that price. I hear people complain about bugs, but I only have found some little problems in physics or IA. Anyway, I have found free technical support at the developers site. Bye!"
1,Not good if you still eat meat.,"Amy, I served chicken noodle soup. I knew chicken noodle soup. Chicken noodle soup was a friend of mine. Amy, you're no chicken noodle soup.If you haven't had meat in awhile, I suspect this would satisfy your chicken noodle soup craving. But if you've had real, homemade chicken noodle soup (or heck, even something else from a can) in the past year, this soup is probably not for you. The faux chicken's texture is not bad, but it tastes like onion-y cardboard. The noodles are fine, but the overall taste is salty and onion-y, and not at all chicken-noodle-soup-y.If this soup dropped the faux chicken and called itself ""onion noodle soup"", I'd probably give it 2 stars. However, as a ""chicken noodle soup"", it's just not very good (unless you love onions, salt and/or haven't had chicken in awhile)."
4,Great record,"Found this CD to be very tight, good vocals and playing. The only negitive is they are a little reserved , could of loosed up a bit and had more guitar . This recording will grow on you the more you listen to it"
2,Didn't Work in my D90,"I recently purchased the Nikon D90 and then since these batteries were so well priced, I bought two of them to have as back up batteries.I charged them up but they didn't work in my new Nikon. First, there is a notch in the top of the battery that isn't quite large enough when compared to the Nikon battery so this battery fits too snugly and must be pried out with tool like a small screw driver.Also the camera reported the battery as lacking any charge and wouldn't power up. The battery that came with my Nikon had three terminals, whereas this battery only had two terminals which I suspect probably has something to do with why the battery didn't work."
3,The Book Was Better,"This movie had a great cast and great potential but just missed its mark and, missed the more interesting flavor and storyline of Ken Bruen's book. It (the movie) is English film noir and an interesting looking gangster flick BUT the screenplay took too many twists and WTF turns in the plot from the original book and left me shaking my head, wondering why whoever okayed the script thought it would work. It was good to see Colin Ferrel offering up yet another convincing role. It's just a shame he didn't have a better vehicle to roll with it.Do yourself a favor. Pick up Bruen's book, London Boulevard or anyone of his other novels and have a good read and you'll see what I mean. Ken Bruen's a writer of note while the adaptation of his book just didn't do him justice."
3,Surprise Ending,The movie was very slow in getting to the point. The one thing it did was surprise me at the ending.
3,If only it stayed with the book,Great start. And then they changed the original in major ways. Some great bad guys. Strong and gritty performances. Colin's character is a gem. If only they stayed with the story.
1,hated it,with such a wonderful cast i expected much more. it went nowhere and ended nowhere. what a disappointment and complete waste of time!
4,Comprehensive...,"HOW TO PUBLISH YOUR NOVEL is a must-read for newbie novelists - even those of us published multiple times can still learn a thing or two from this book! Providing a comprehensive checklist of steps for those on their way to a published product, author Ken Atchity covers every angle. From editor preferences, to submission gaffes, Atchity outlines the pitfalls and proven practices along the road to published bliss.Not only does the author provide samples of the ""must-haves"" in a submission package, he also gives good advice on finding a literary agent, self-publishing your work, and how to decide what's right for YOUR novel.For those looking for the ""right"" way to get their book noticed, I'd highly recommend reading HOW TO PUBLISH YOUR NOVEL."
1,total junk JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First off, you need to be an engineer to put this together. It looks OK from the outside. There is nothing ""NATURAL"" or ""MAPLE"" about it. The Item is misleading and made from heavy, chemical laden engineered wood. I put it together over a month ago and my clothes STILL smell like chemicals. Tiny storage and plastic gliding shelves that are difficult to open or close....a HUGE waste of time and money."
3,Not great as an MP3 player.,"This Clie handles the usual fuctions of a PDA about as well as the average Palm OS machine, I supose. I have not used any other PDA's, so I can't compair it. I have used other portable MP3 players and they have been easy to use, easy to load with music and generaly easy to use the fuction buttons and keys. This NR70 Sony Clie will only play music encoded at 112 bits or higher. This makes the music files take up a lot of room. I am normally able to encode at a bit rate of 32 and get very acceptable sound quality. With the NR70 and a 128 meg Memory Stick you can load a little over 40 songs. If you want to use this Clie as a MP3 player, give the above some ""serious thinken"" before you plunk down [money]. Memory Stick cost is over and above the [money]"
2,"At some point the ""photo"" in Photoshop got lost",This book is fine if you're a budding graphic artist but disappointing if you're a photographer who wants to know how to use Photoshop to enhance digital photographs.
5,Worth Every Dollar...,"This book is one of the best books I have used for PhotoShop, because it has one of the best hands-on lesson plans out there. After 3 lessons, a novice can not only navigate PhotoShop (which can be intimidating, if you have no clue what the palette tools do/are), but IN 3 LESSONS, a new user can learn to make color corrections, repairs and make/move item selections. This book isn't necessarily the best choice for seasoned users (though it does have an excellent introduction to Adobe Bridge), but it is ideal for beginners.If you know nothing about PhotoShop (and your co-worker is holding out for ""job security"" or your boss won't pay for training), this book will cover the same things that a $369 class can, and best of all, at your own pace."
3,One Might Say,"Billy Lawrence has an interesting voice (sings soprano) and this album is an interesting mix of beautiful ballads & mid-tempo grooves. The sound of a few tracks could fall into the ""neo-soul"" sounding category which, considering that the album was released in 1994 was ahead of its time!Honestly after listening to it again, there really aren't any standout singles on the disc but each track features excellent music & vocal production and coupled with the fact that Billy wrote or co-wrote a majority of the songs prompted me to give the album 3 stars as a solid ""B"" effort.My standout tracks are:ONE MIGHT SAY - very funky upbeat trackHAPPINESS - although it sounds dated, the lyrics are sweetYOUR GOOD LUV - uptempo track with catchy music productioOverall, I'd recommend this disc to the curious about a different kind of ""r&b; chick"" from the early '90's."
5,Easy install,I installed in my 2003 Chevy Trailblazer (SWB) LT. Install went smoothly and it included all the hardware I needed.
3,Cute fit,"I like this on my 9 year old daughter. It is fitting and long but looks too cute with an undershirt, long songs and dress shoes. She was not too thrilled about it and has only worn it once."
1,Broke Quickly - Sony Didn't Honor Warranty!!!,"I loved my Clie until it broke only 2 1/2 months after I paid $599 for it. I sent it in for warranty repair - they promised 10 day turn around. A MONTH later they finally told me what was wrong with it, said it wasn't covered under warranty, and asked for MORE THAN $400 to fix it. I escalated within Sony and got the price down to $170, but they still won't fix it under warranty. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in SONY. I thought this unit was last for years, like my Palm IIIc that it replaced. I was wrong. Sony caused me to lose my employer's trust for decisions like this. I wish I had chosen another brand in the first place. Don't choose gadgets over reliability like I did!"
2,Poor support and no address labels,"Very nice package but the Sony Clie Palm OS package is very ""lite"" as they put it. It no longer has the drag and drop feature for address labels and cannot be upgraded to the OS upgrades on the Palm website. The email support is abysmal. I could not be more disappointed with the overall product and support."
2,What happened?,"I agree with the other reviewers, the first Sea Hunters was much better, even though there were problems with that book. This one is jarring in places - you can clearly see where Clive Cussler left off and Craig Dirgo picked up. Dirgo is not a good writer. I found some inaccuracies, which I know Cussler didn't make, because his research is meticulous. It's too bad, this could have been a better book with the right writer.The only reason I am keeping this book is because I'm in the last chapter (which I helped write, which means it was written well). It's fun to pull the book out and show people the photo and part I wrote. Then it goes right back on the shelf."
3,Too much unsubstantiated fiction,"When writing a work of fiction interwoven with historical fact, the author(s) really should provide an appendix clearly separating the two.I mention only two examples from this book. The White Bird was a plane that has never been found, yet Cussler writes authoritatively on exactly how the two men died, from one man getting the top of his head cut off to the other having his back broken and sinking beneath the waves.Second is the Marie Celeste, where he has the crew get into a boat to escape what they believe to be a sinking ship, how they become separated from the ship, and a chronology of how each one of the crew dies.Now, reading his attempts to discover the wrecks is interesting, but I wish he'd not tried the fiction parts of it which really do invalidate this book as a serious source."
2,This book is a sunken ship!,"I absolutely love Clive Cusslers books but I don't love this book. In fact, I don't even like it. Usually, his books grip me from beginning to end. This one didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I tried to read it 3 times but had to put it down each time. It was completely unsatisfying...I was expecting a great Clive read but ended up with THIS???!!!"
3,Clive should stick to novels,"First and foremost, let me say I have read EVERYTHING Mr. Cussler has ever published. He is my favorite author and his novels are top notch. His characters are humanistic and his stories are absolutely plausable which is what makes him so good at what he does. He takes a bit of historical fact and then sits down and says ""What if"".... Then writes it down with that amazing imagination of his.I am sure there is a readership for his non-fiction, but I am not a fan. I just wonder why someone who is so good at technical novels would write anything else."
4,Update Needed,"Robert Putnam's ""Bowling Alone"" is an exhaustive meta-study of the deflation of social capital in the 20th century. But as a reflective piece, it gives few tools with which to interpret major cultural movements in the decade since its publication. What would Putnam write about Facebook, Twitter, the Great Recession, the Tea Party, or the Occupy Movement? But what Putnam does not give readers in tools for reflection he makes up for in voluminous data. ""Bowling Alone"" makes some strong suggestions toward answering the question on many 21st century minds: ""What's wrong with America?"""
3,Reads like it was written by a professor (it was).,"The author has accumulated an astounding range of statistics supporting his discovery that people in America are not as connected to each other as they used to be. (Example: people still bowl but now are less willing to join organized bowling leagues). And he uses those statistics, which makes this book slogging through repeated evidence for the same thing.The finding, based on this exhaustive statistical evidence, appears significant. But whether recognizing the problem can lead to an improvement is another question."
1,another economistic view on social life,"booo! booo! this book, while well written and accessible, is ultimately just another book that enforces the commodification of everything, all the way to our personal interactions. the essential elements of modern society that he diagnoses are on point, but then his analysis is way off point and unreflective of our actual conditions. it is purely a reactionary piece that doesn't look at root causes of why our social and civil lives are disintegrating, but only enforces the alienation that already exists by blanketing the social with the economic. a superficial view that should only be used as a supplemental text."
4,Helpful Company to deal with,"The first one I received was defective--it rusted terribly. It actually rotted through the screen in little spots. I called the number on the box and they acknowledged it was a defective one and IMMEDIATELY sent a new one. The new one works perfectly- no rust, so easy to use and drains well.(cheese cloth works,but is such a mess) I appreciated the fact that the Cuisipro folks were so prompt to replace."
4,Great for homemade yogurt,"I make homemade yogurt and it tends to be thinner than store bought products because it has no thickeners. Since I like my yogurt the consistency of ""greek"" yogurt, I decided to purchase this product. It does a great job separating the whey and makes a nice thick product. The consistency is that of softened cream cheese. It makes a great breakfast spread especially when mixed with some peanut butter and jelly. It is also much easier to clean than a cheese bag.My only wish was that this product held more than a cup or so of yogurt to begin with. Makes it 4 cups and it would be perfect (I typically make 4 cups at a time).Overall it is a great product."
3,A kitchen towel works better,Most of the yogurt passe throu !Cheese making from yogurt works much wetter with a simple kitchen towel !
5,Goodbye paper towels,"i used to take paper towels cover a strainer and drain plain yogurt. This product works easily. Just put your yogurt in the strainer, put the lid on and in a few hours or the next day you have a healthy sour cream. I like putting dill and hot sauce in it as a nice dip for artichokes. You can replace sour cream with plain yogurt."
5,The most important Cthulhu fiction since Lovecraft himself.,"Cthulhu comes of age. Ignore the fact that this book is linked to an RPG - it doesn't matter. It contains some of the best Lovecraftian short stories of the last fifty years. The mythos is brought up to date with punchy, well-crafted modern short stories and all the tension and atmosphere you could hope for. The stories by John Tynes, Bob Kruger and Greg Stolze are a particular pleasure. I cannot recommend this book highly enough - it's up there with Thomas Ligotti's Songs of a Dead Dreamer as a vital read for any fan of wierd horror."
5,All you could want to know and more.,"This book is a treasure chest of information about major and minor musicians in ""contemporary Christian music."" The author also includes ""cross-over"" artists, such as Sixpence None the Richer, and mainstream artists who often explores spiritual themes in their music, such as U-2.If you've ever listened to any of this music, you'll enjoy reading this; I started flipping through, intending to just check out a few groups I liked, and I ended up completely engrossed for hours!The author does throw in his two cents about various artists, but I thought his opinions were a hoot!"
3,A Must-Have for Christian Libraries,"The strengths of Mark Allan Powell's Encyclopedia of Christian Contemporary Music are its humorous opinions (bad music about God by white people) and is thoroughness (Eric Clapton). These are also its weaknesses. Those who want a scholarly resource to use in this area of church history will be somewhat disappointed by the flippant opinionated approach. Those who want to understand the field and not be put to sleep while doing so will be appreciative of the author's witty style. While far from perfect, Powell has found a way to launch an important work despite skeptical publishers. Let's hope subsequent iterations turn it into a more serious multi-volume hardback series that is the definitive resource for Christian contemporary Music."
4,Fantastico,"It is the healthy blue corn chip meets the unsalted diet crowd. Great for HTN, Diabetes and an number of low-salt diets without the sacrifice of taste. Can you say que rico?"
1,disappointed,The shipment arrived timely but the chips were all in crumbs. A new shipment was sent out by Amazon and that arrived in a box that was already ripped open and I was advised by the post office to refuse delivery which I did. I'm now waiting for the refund Amazon promised me.
2,TOO SMALL!,In no way is this a Medium sized Pillow... It's more like a little kids pillow. I was so disappointed I might just throw the pillow away!or I could give it to my dog to use!
3,Thank GOD....finally,I have waited and thought NEVER to see this on CD.....LEAN ME ON....what I say.
1,Not Worth The Re-Issue,"I'm a Big Fan Of Maxine Nightingale And Was Pleased To See That They Had Released The Lead Me On LP on CD. But To Tell You The Truth, It's Not Worth It... Even At A Low Cost. The Sound Is Very Bad, Alot Of Hiss and The Sound Is Muffled (Sounds Like It Came From A Cassette That That I Might Have Recorded Years Back)Not From The Original Masters. The Track Lead Me Os Is On Several Compilations, And They Sound Pristine As Aposed To This CD. There Is A Bonus Track 9,Not Listed On The CD, But The Track 8 Is Really The Bonus Track, Thery Messed Up On The Pressing.I Really Don't Recommend It! Unless You Don't Care About The Audio Quality."
5,The book is exactly what I have been looking for.,"The volume is an excellent aid in transcribing various family documents into German. Because of the nature of my work, it would be enormously helpful to put it all on CD for instant access and retrieval."
5,Works as advertised,"Bought this unit for powering a few items during a recent road trip. Has a sleek look and functions properly. I particularly like the fact that it has both USB ports and the car charging ports, that is definitely useful."
3,"Great charger, better if wired in however",The unit works as expected. We use a Griffin low profile dual usb adapter in one of the 2 12v outlets to give us 4 usb ports. The only trouble we had with the unit was that the 12v plug on our unit wouldn't stay plugged into any 12v outlet we tried unless held in place. Tried 3 on the boat and in both our cars. Not an issue since we'll be hardwiring it into a fuse panel anyway.Nice that it is a 20A unit! The cord is quite rugged and a decent length so that splicing wouldn't usually be required.
5,Full 5V USB ports is a nice surprise.,"I originally bought this just to add an additional 12 socket to a car that woefully needs more of them.Yes, I noticed the USB ports and figured they were a value add that wouldn't work with my demanding devices: a blackberry and a zune that both DEMAND 5V usb ports. Often times items such as this Vehicle Charger supply something short of USB 2.0 specified 5v, as many devices are willing to accept 4.5.Surprise! Full 5V! At least when one usb port is used at a time. I haven't tried two devices plugged in at the same time.Most importantly, the charger doesn't get noticeably hot, and the cable is of a decent gauge. You can mount the unit either with velcro with adhesive backing, or direcly screw it to a surface. The fuse is easy to get to if you ever have to replace it.Very very pleased with this purchase. I've been using it for a couple of months now with no complaints."
4,Very nice,This is a very good tool for cars with less power sockets. Two power socket and two usb port is enough for gps and multile phones.
4,Good documentary,"Although it is a bit short in length, this is a good documentary on subs, including some discussion of strategy."
4,This Was A Good Buy,"I am always interested in the history and the workings of mililary operations. The DVD movie is a good representation of submarine history. Many often forget that after Pearl Harbor, the 'Silent Service' was the main means of defense in the Pacific until the fleet could be rebuilt. Or that Rickover was the father of our present nuclear navy. A navy that kept this world safe during the Cold War.The music CD is a pleasant surprise. My wife enjoys that. We both enjoy Mozart."
5,I love this Ice Cream Maker,"Believe it or not, I've had mine for 10 years and I still think it's the greatest. All we ever want is a small amount of ice cream and I've been making 2 cups; we like it after it has set in the maker for about 20 minutes after stirring up, not frozen hard the next day. Right now I'm shopping for one for relatives."
3,Ice Cream maker,The Donvier 1 qt ice cream came defective as shipped. I couldn't find any evidence of damage during shipping but the paddle that stirs the ice cream mixture didn't fit the container when the lid was screwed tight. It would bind and then the handle couldn't be turned. It is such a hassle to return items like this I spent 30 minutes modifing the spatula with O.K. results. Other than that it gives good results. The recipe book it comes with is very skimpy but then that's why we have imaginations.
2,tools are cheap ones....not very sturdy.,"I like it to keep in my house for small task. The tools are cheap ones, not very sturdy. The bag does not open wide enough to see what is in it. I have to take everything out when looking for something. But for the price it is ok."
2,Ok,"The tools are below average quality, the tape measure was broken to begin with, but still useful to have around. Not so great for the money."
1,Inferior product,When I received the product I immediately recognized that it was porly made and unfit for regular use. The tools were thin and would not stand up to pressure.
3,So-so,"It's a very quick read, but I didn't get into it like I should have. I did feel something for the characters obviously because I was sad at the end. Maybe it's for a different demographic, but it's not for me."
3,Q.Rose fan,"Just like the other reviewers, I am looking for info or other music by Q.Rose. Her voice is magnificent. Please place any info or other music or albums she has made here- thanks"
3,Still ISO,"Q. Rose, with that sultry blue voice, still seems to be a mystery. Margo Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies possesses many similar vocal qualities.... Anyone have any other leads?"
2,Incompatibility with Panasonic miniDV camcorder PV-GS200,"Unfortunately, I did not have very good experience with this brand the first time I bought it. I purchased an ATP 256MB SD card for my new Panasonic MiniDV 3CCD camcorder (PV-GS200) and it didn't work. My PV-GS200 can either read from or write to it. It simply says ""NO DATA."" I tried two new ATP SD cards and none of them worked. The ATP card did, however, work with PV-GS120 model. So I returned them and bought a Sandisk brand and it worked perfectly. I think ATP needs to test their product compatibility more thoroughly before putting out the claim that it works with all Panasonic camcorders. I think it was really a waste of my time and energy on cheaper but also poorer quality product."
5,This is the best rural cult movie of all time!,"Have you ever wondered what a gobbler with an eleven-inch beard looks like. You will.Vernon, Florida is a documentary masterpiece of backwoods weirdness. This is Errol Morris' first feature film and by far his best. Others include: ""The Gates of Heaven,"" ""Thin Blue Line"" and ""A Brief History of Time.""Unfortunately, this video is out of print, but don't let it discourage you. Find a copy any way you can and watch this movie -- if only to see the eleven-inch beard of a Florida gobbler.""You hear that flap flap sound? Them's breaking. Ooh wee, that gives me the turkey fever!"""
2,Could be better,"This movie is okay, but does not feel complete. The people in this one are not expressed enough in the movie, and I felt at the end that this played out more like a long trailer for a movie instead of a completed one. Morris had a good idea here, but it seemed too brief and desultory throughout. It's worth watching, but it leaves you wanting more depth and length. Possibly Morris at the time this was made had not totally developed his documentary style, it does play like a sort of practice film compared to other works such as Gates of Heaven and the First Person series."
2,Not nearly as good as his other movies,"Being a big Errol Morris fan I was excited to find this in the local video store. Like other reviewers, however, I found it tedious and repetitive. Worse still was the plotless nature of it. I couldn't figure out the point of the movie (Disclaimer : I only watched half of it. Perhaps it all came together at the end.)If you want to see a good Errol Morris movie get ""The Thin Blue Line "" or ""Fog of War"". If you see this first it will put you off his other excellent work."
1,worked ok for the first 6 months...,"I bought the ""grape"" version for my daughters, and it seemed fine for a few months. Then the first thing that happened is the door to the CD player on top broke so it remained opened all the time. It still worked if we put a book on it to weigh it down. Then the CD player went out all together - started playing all CDs at double their speed. Well, I figured I could at least use the tape player, but surprise, surprise, the tape player went out next. We've had it about a year and the only thing that works now is the radio, and even that doesn't work so well (reception is pretty lousy.) I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Junk,"We purchased 2 for these for our grandchildren for Christmas gifts, one blue and one grape. The CD player on the grape on worked about 5 minutes and has not worked since. We did our shopping early in the season and on-line and due to the strict return policies we are stuck with a CD player that does not work. We wish we had spent a little more for a better quality product."
3,Whatever!,"If you're an original BadCo fan....yeah....then this is probably not for you, but please......Brain Howe made his own mark and if you can't appreciate that.....you're NO rock fan in anyway.....shape or form!! PERIOD! ......while this doesn't feature Paul Rodgers the rest of the lineup IS BadCO......and they do an excellent job of taking fans on the ride that they were on at that particulart time in thier career! Mick Ralphs sounds great and shows that he can change and stay afloat at a time when there really wasn't much by way of Classic Rockers out there! Simon Kirke is steady as well......so if you like live concerts and classic rock......then sip a few gin and tonics and appreciate this for what it is...classic rockers trying to give their fans some music and still make a living enjoying what God let them do the best while they go through life! Spread the music!"
3,Got it.,"I purchased this book years ago, and heard Prophetess Juanita teach on the threshing floor and that's what lead me to purchase her book.Obedience Is Better Than Sacrifice"
3,Deeper in Prayer,This book challenged me to take a deeper look at my prayer life and to be more consistent. I thought that the symbolism regarding the tabernacle was good.
1,"$200,000","Now that she on her way to divorce she states on her site an emergence, she wants you to send her $200,000 bucks to build a new threshing floor. Too bad she spent Millions on a wedding that didn't take or she could have paid cash for her little emergence. hay wait how much was that wedding ring ??? pawn shop time !"
3,Interesting old-time approach to building stuff,"This one of six books by the author, each building upon the previous one. The text details how to build your own metal lathe with a minimum of ready-made parts, based primarily on aluminum castings you make yourself (as shown in Book #1 of the series).I did not build the lathe, but I did read this and his ""How to Build A Milling Machine"" book. The author takes the approach of using 19th century techniques and designs, showing how to emulate them with today's hardware store components. Sadly, the books lack any color photos. There are tons of drawings, and a couple of moderately clear black and white photos.While interesting, the machines seem to appear VERY home-made when complete. It is also clear that many, many hours are required in the construction.Although I did find the author's ""can do"" approach encouraging, I think you'd be better off saving your money for a ready-made lathe..."
4,An Excellent Spiritual Handbook for Seekers of Truth,"The Mystic Path to Cosmic Power is en excellent starting point if you are ready to begin your own, personal spiritual journey. Vernon Howard avoids an ego-pleasing, erudite, overly philosophical approach, instead offering an extremely practical guide: the beginning steps to self-enlightenment. Taking as a basis that we are all living in a kind of psychic sleep, he offers practical techniques to 'wake up'.For those who have already done a significant amount of spiritual reading, Howard's approach may seem 'populistic', but his dichotomy between the 'true self' and the 'false self' is misleadingly simple. In fact, he has distilled a very powerful thought system that is easy to understand for those who have little experience in spiritual matters but are looking for a better way of life, but that is also very much worth considering for those already well on their way."
3,Cool shape but poor quality,"These are cool looking glasses and with decent strength (none has broken so far). But the quality of these are average. The reason I say that is at the curves, you can see and feel a glass joint line. It varies from piece to piece and is very prominent in few. Overall they are okay glasses for everyday. I was expecting more based on other reviews but you get what you paid for."
5,"Really nice glasses, and even better customer service","Hi... I purchased a set of these glasses, and they arrived quickly, but broken. After using amazon.com's return procedure, the vendor notified me that they would send me another set, no charge. I got the second set, all intact, just as fast. I got exactly what I wanted, and I'm glad to give the vendor a really good review. Thanks!"
1,"Disappointing quality, so-so design","The glasses all have very distinct, unsightly seams on opposite sides, where two halves were apparently joined in the manufacturing process. The thickness of the base varies from one side of the glass to the other, and on some glasses is very thin.The assymetrical profile of the glasses, which is striking and clever in the photos, is not so great after all, as the interesting shape gradually disappears as you rotate the glass 90 degrees. At that point you just see a slightly odd glass with ugly seams.There are so many interesting examples of glassware out there these days, I would not bother with this cheaply executed concept from Libby."
4,Great MP3 Player & Flash Drive,"I just love it!!! It is AWESOME!!!...i swear. It's VERY SMALL...u can fit it ANYWHERE! The sound is great, the earbuds are ok! I bet if u get better ones, the sound would be even better. I agree with others about the NO CARRYING CASE provided issue. It gets a little bit scratched very easily..but who cares if the main function is accomplished?? Right?GREAT SOUND, very PORTABLE, Good capacity, FAST!THE PRODUCT is 5 stars...the software SONIC STAGE not so good. It's a little bit hard to figure it out at first, but once u get the hang of it's ok. WHAT TO DO? Someone told me to download an MP3 File manager...it's supposed to install this software in the player, and then u can transfer files from any computer. Otherwise u need the stupid sonic stage!!! that's the BIGGEST CON!I RECCOMEND U BUY THIS!!! Totally SATISFIED!!! ;)"
2,Not recommended,"I've had the product one month. It does play the music that I put on it, but I would not buy again.First, it only works with the special software that comes with it, which limits it to connecting to one computer. You cannot simply copy MP3 files to the unit, so it is really false advertising to call it an MP3 player.Another thing: in daylight, I cannot read the display at all. It is very dim."
1,"Good design, Bad implimentation","I was initially impressed with small cool design and digital display of the Sony NW-E005 until I received mine. Unlike every other USB hard drive with the Sony drive you can't simply drag and drop your existing MP3 and WMA music files to it. You must first load the Sony software, and then it goes through and converts all of you music files to Sony proprietary format. Now every time you want to add more music you need to download it then convert it. The software is not user friendly and converting file formats is simply a waste of time. I guess the Sony Music people got their hands a hold of this and wanted add protection for themselves and avoid losing licensing fees. Very annoying!!"
2,not what I expected,"I got these so that I could throw them into the back seat of my car and not have them leak. They failed. Firstly, it is difficult to screw the top on correctly I think because the threads are not deep enough. Then, when it is screwd on tight, if tipped, it leaks. Lastly, the mug is too large for small to medium hands to grasp and press the lever to open. If you are driving it is near impoaaible. They are pretty."
3,Great auto tumbler but terrible at keeping coffee warm,"I read the recommendations in an automobile magazine (I think Road and Track) that ranks this tumbler the best for driving so I purchased it from Amazon.com. Boy was I disappointed. Yes, it does keep the spills to a minimum no matter what you do. But coffee gets cold within an hour at best. There seems to be no insulation at all which defeats the whole purpose of purchasing a tumbler. It's like just carrying a paper cup with a lip. I would highly recommend going with the Starbucks tumblers. Those usually keep the coffee warm for a long time but I keep on losing the gosh darn lids."
3,Better to get the stainless steel,"I love my Contigo stainless steel mug and recently bought a TON for Christmas gifts, to give ppl ""MY FAVORITE THINGS"". I must say these plastic ones DO NOT COMPARE to the stainless steel. Don't waste your $ on this one, go directly for the stainless steel one! This is not as dishwasher safe nor does it have the capability to keep liquids as hot/cold for the length of the stainless one."
4,Beautiful color but teeny teeny bit of spill potential.,"After destroying a purse because my old travel mug was not spill-proof, I came on Amazon to find something that was.I love the deep red color of this mug and really like the shape. However, I've learned that after pouring in your coffee, hold down the button as you screw the top on. Then swirl it around a bit, and press the button to release any extra air pressure. You might actually hear a ""poof"" sound as the pressure escapes. Sometimes I do this twice. After that, it's good to go and I simply toss it in my bag with no worries of spillage.As some have mentioned, after drinking, sometimes there's a teeny teeny bit left in the space between the lip and the seal which could spill out. Important to know!"
3,"Made for the quick drinker, on the go!","If you're looking for something to pour the rest of your coffee into for the morning commute, then this is perfect. You get what you pay for. The release button will start to stick over time, and it doesn't hold a lot. There was no leaking, which is perfect! But if you like to sip and enjoy your coffee... look elsewhere."
1,Disappointed in THIS model. Stainless Steel model works great,"I originally purchased the Stainless Steel 2-Pack and lost one of them. I bought this one for my wife because she likes the smaller size (16 vs 14oz) and I am cheap and didn't want to buy two more. The price for this one was great and I have been very happy with the first one. So I purchased this. It stinks! It won't keep the coffee warm for 20 minutes. Works as 'well' as the old, random coffee mugs that I was trying to replace in the first place. I suggest getting the stainless steel version. Keeps the coffee very warm for a long time. Very happy with that one. Won't buy the plastic one again"
3,"May Be A Decent Mug, But It's NOT Stainless Steel...","Since this mug came up on my Amazon search for ""stainless steel travel mugs,"" and since at least one version seems to be stainless steel (the silver-colored one), I bought this believing the inside would be stainless steel. Well, it's not; it's plastic. Since the whole point of buying a new travel mug was that I was trying to replace plastic with stainless steel, this was a waste of money, for me. I know this mug is billed as BPA-free, but I've grown increasingly wary of drinking hot liquids out of plastic, period, so I'll be returning this, as it wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Not what I thought it was,"I thought this was another stainless steel Contigo cup like others I've bought. I wanted another color. However, this one is plastic and not really insulated like the others are. I was very disappointed."
1,Leaks like a siev,"This mug is a joke. Not only do you have to hold the button in while you drink but it leaks when it is overturned. I returned mine and bought the OXO liquiseal mug (5 stars). It worked far better, no spill, and it's vaccum sealed stainless body kept my Joe warm for several hours. It clicks open and closed so you control when you want to close and seal it. Lid is a bit tough to clean but for the security of no spill in your car or bag it is worth the effort."
2,False advertising,"You are advertising for 3 discs but actually are only sending one. Why list all discs! Very misleading!I could have chosen other CD's. Thought it was a deal and all the songs I was missing were listed on this CD, but too good to be true!"
4,Norah Jones Comparison? hmmmmmmmmm,"Mozella has a great voice and lyrical style. If I were to compare her to anyone (vocally speaking), (sorry Mozella...most artists hate to be compared), I'd say a mash-up between Esthero, Corrine Bailey Rae and Macy Gray. LOVE the tunes and wish her ALL the success she deserves!!!"
2,Not bad but mis-titled,"Where is the synthesis? I didn't see it. The material is too dense for beginners, too scattered for the non-beginner.There are several places where the author states something absolutely intriguing and moves on in the next sentence. For example, after much discussion of handling probability, he states that Bayesian networks are probably the way to go. And that's all that was said, ""Wait, wait"" I wanted to shout. ""Tell me more about why you believe that!"" But alas that's all there is.Also, this book is probably too detailed for non-programmers, not detailed enough for programmers."
3,"Terse, Compact and Fast","This is generally a good book with an effective unifying theme. However, each chapter is very dense, terse and presents complex material very quickly. This would not be my recommendation for a first book on AI. Author assumes the reader has a lot of preliminary informatin."
4,"AI from the ""intelligent agent"" perspective","Nilsson's book presents all major areas of artificial intelligence from the unifying perspective of the problem of constructing an intelligent agent. Many of the important subfields of AI are introduced, including machine learning. The book is clearly written and can be understood if you have a good knowledge of computer science. (Yon certainly don't need a doctorate degree in mathematics, as claimed by anothe reviewer)."
5,The Ultimate Care Guide,"This is the most complete and accurate guide to caring for pets rats that I have ever read. It is a terrible shame that it has been allowed to go out of print. It is an indispensible reference for new and experienced rat owners. Nutrition, training, history, health...it's all here, along with some really cute photos."
5,great,"We have had horses all of our lives. think you know so much, but, there is always more that you need to know. found the book to be very informative and usefull."
4,When Your Rope Breaks,"""When Your Rope Breaks"" is an encouraging read for the person who is experiencing tough challenges. The author uses the Book of Job as one of his main references for his title.Among the points covered include:1. Suffering is inevitable in this world - many times we do something the right way only to have it fall apart.2. The world revolves around God, not us.3. Wonderful things to remember when our rope breaks (God is working things out for His glory, we will make it through, etc.).4. Through God's grace we can persevere.5. Do not let bitterness have a place in your life.6. Sometimes our rope breaks because of what we have done. Other times our rope breaks because of the way the world works.7. What Job's friends did right and wrong.8. Discouragement is one of the greatest challenges when our rope breaks.Read and be encouraged to persevere in the Lord when life gets tough.Recommended."
5,From Someone Who Knows It All,"Michael Levine is like no other in his field. This book is a great way to dive into the mind of a person who has been in the entertainment industry for decades. If you're curious about PR and you are ready to learn about this field, I recommend this book."
2,A book for the inexperienced or unenlightened,"If you have NO experience, NO education or NO background in marketing, running a small business or promoting a web site, you MIGHT get something out of this book. To illustrate, here are a few of ""Levine's 10 Commandments for Internet PR"" listed in this book (paraphrased to save space): 1. Know your audience, 2. Know your product 3. Don't send spam ... 5. Don't overspend, 7. Send email to interested parties, 9. Seek out and provide links to your site. Some real ground-breaking revelations here, as you can see. I also found the writing style to be a bit condescending and wordy, as if the author was trying to stretch very slim information into a decent sized book. That pretty much is what this book is about - a few commonsense basics that anyone but a complete novice already knows, stretched into a book."
2,Not a good book,"In this book, the author just describes most of the components of ATL applications. That's a very different thing from explaining the ""whys"". This means : if you don't have previous knowledge of COM, you will get a plain static picture of every component of COM, but you won't learn what the role of that component is inside your application, and what is the relation among these components. For example, the author describes the example programs line by line, but he fails to explain in detail the purpose of this lines and their implications for the rest of the program. Finally, the book is too superfitial, and it seems that the sole purpose of it is to generate profits not to teach the reader. I guess the other five-start-givers-readers had previous knowledge of COM or they just wanted to have an superfitial idea of ATL and COM. Of course, not my case."
5,lines west,It is a wonderful book.It is essential for anyone who is a Great Northern Rail-Fan to read and have in his collection!Thank-you Jeff H.
2,dvd low quality,don't know who actually produced these dvd's. I thought I was buying original copies. these are very bad duplicates. seems to give a lot of formatting errors to the dvd reader.would not buy again.could not get disc 4 of season 2 to play at all... another wash out.love the series though.
4,if you liked walking with dinosaurs ( allosaurus ) you will love prehistoric park,"this was a gift purchased for my son, for christmas he loves dinosaurs and has the entire collection of walking with dinosaurs. his favorite disc has nigel marven in it and also has the allosaurus speacial in it. the day before i went online to look for this my son had asked for another nigel marven video. i wasnt' sure where to look but found this on amazonthe animation is good enough for any kid to love and resembles more jurasic park style animals as well as some new animals. it is well done and offers a lot of documentary style glimpses into the dinosaurs and other extinct animals lives. if you enjoyed walking with dinosaurs you will love this one. plus the funny interaction with the british zoologist nigel marven is fantastic, he really makes it seem like he is actualy interacting with these creatures."
5,You will no regret this book,"In general, I approach most of the ""self-help"" literature with a heavy dose of skepticism. Dear Dinah requires no such remedy. It is a very well reasoned manual for dual working couples living in the new millennium. My wife and I are both professionals and typically let household chores get done on a desultory basis -- more often than not (I can admit) my better half picks up the slack. Finally, we agreed that it was ludicrous not to have a more organized household. The detailed, yet straight forward, quizzes provided in the book were extremely useful in dividing up responsibilities. Given the amount of time we spending planning our workdays, it is amazing how little time we devote to planning our homework. Dear Dinah helped us alleviate that problem."
4,Old Skool & a Babe,"I love this movie. I have not seen it for a long time. I am glad that sexy Maria Menounos who is now on ""Extra"" with Mario Lopez played in it. However, that is the only movie she acted. I love the front DVD cover with Jamie Kennedy, his pals, and the babe (Maria Menounos) wearing nice coat and shorts plus showing nice legs."
2,Disappointing,"I love the Hetty Wainthropp series, but this DVD was disappointing. There wasn't much mystery, and it was missing Geoffrey, and a different actor played Robert; I agree with another reviewer, there was no chemistry between the characters such as what you find in the series. I was very excited when I received it, I wanted to introduce a couple of my friends to Hetty, but they were unimpressed. I wished afterwards that I had shown them the first DVD of Series 1 instead."
2,A little odd and a bit off from what the series became.,"It has been a while since we watched this movie short. We thought it would be a good way to start watching the entire 4 Seasons of the Hetty Wainthropp TV series, which I had also purchased at Christmas time. So, we watched the show and when it was over we kind of looked at each other and agreed, that was kind of weird. The story was a bit depressing and just not very satisfying. That being said we started into the Wainthropp Series (2 seasons so far) and it is developing into an interesting show. It is obvious that story telling in the UK differs from Hollywood in surprising ways. The typical MO of a Hollywood plot line are pleasantly avoided with this series. Each show is unique in its own way.Anyway, the price for Missing Persons was so good, it doesn't really matter that it is not that enjoyable. At least we have seen everything that is a available. Who knows maybe you will like it?"
2,Weirdest purchasing experience ever. Code has 0 credits.,"It took about 4 or 5 hours to get a code, just like the other reviewers mentioned.The code, still - 16 hours later, continues to give me ""0 credits"" when I try to purchase apps from the MS phone store.I'm still waiting for Amazon support. I needed the app yesterday. Now there's no point, but still would like my credit to function."
4,"Easy and fast, expensier though","Very fast and easy way to get points, live gold memberships and video games' downloads. I strongly recommend this way of getting the mentioned if you're OK with paying some extra bucks. Most of the times Amazon has cards on discount, but you need to wait to get them or go to a store to find one. I give this product 4 stars. Once they cost the same (as cards) I'll change to 5."
1,No tax? What flavor kool aid have ya'll been drinking?!,NYS applied tax for this purchase. One star because I was (mistakenly) led here by the reviews stating savings due to no tax.
5,Live 1600 Points Code,"This won't take more than a paragraph to write about. Microsoft Points are used to purchase content for games, or games themselves(XBLA). This was purchased to give to someone else and it was quite nice to have it get here quickly without any delay. So it got here fast, and the code worked fine.That's really all there is to it, and they did it successfully."
3,Confused,"Not for sure what I did wrong, but I purchased 800 points thinking this would buy my son some time on xbox live and thought it would alleviate me from having to enter my credit card onto his xbox live. Well, I received the online code, my son entered it on his xbox and it still asked for a credit card # to verify. I have no clue what I just did. I feel like I've been charged for the 800 points and now I'm thinking Xbox has just charged me for something."
1,HORRIBLE,"GAME CODE DID NOT WORK, AMAZON CODE MESSED UP. ENDED UP CALLING MICROSOFT AND BEING ON THE PHONE FOR HALF AN HOUR TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK. LOUSY."
1,Stolen,These points along with others were stolen from me.No way to find out who used them...I don't know if I can ever get those points...
1,DO NOT BUY,"Today is January 27th 2013, review time is 8:57amI just bought 4000 points and guess what??????INVALID CODE!!!!! Tried on my XBOX and Xbox.comIt's fake.....tomorrow I will go to the bank and cancel the credit card payment.....this is BS!!!!"
1,Code was invalid.....,"My son gave me the money to buy him an 800 point code for his X-Box. He tried to enter it several times with no luck, so I entered it, and a message came up on the screen that it had already been completely used. We had just gotten it, so that could not be the case. He is very disappointed that he spent his hard earned money, and cannot enjoy what he bought for it.."
5,Cheaper and Safer,"With all of the different console hacking stories on the news, I would recommend buying a Microsoft Points card on Amazon instead of storing your card info online. Not only is the game card cheaper (no tax) but you can get it just as fast with the online game code option."
5,Great timely delivery,My son enjoys the convenience of this purchase and it's use. I will definitely make this purchase again in the future.
5,Cheaper then through the console,"Buying M$ points through Amazon is easier and cheaper then through the console. You don't have tax which is a big thing when you buy enough points over time. You get an instant code you can plug in and spend them right away. You also don't have to put a credit card on file on your Xbox, which decreases possible security issues.This is the only way I get my points anymore."
4,It's 1600 points,What's to review. This is Microsoft money. If you need it you must buy it and you can't seem to get a deal on it. It is what it is I guess.
5,More points,I was thinking what to buy with my $20 gift card so i bought this sincei wanted more microsoft points.
3,What Happened,How Will I Get My Redeem Codes....I have placed my order and got a message that its taking too long and that I would be contacted.
3,Well,I decided to order this way in order to keep my credit card off of X-box live. The message I got after ordering was that processing could take up to four hours and that they would send me a link to my redeem code. Really? I would be better off to get a Visa gift card to put on X-Box live. I could recharge it when needed and would not have processing problems. Not happy.
1,takes to long,takes for ever to process order i've bought this item 4 times now and it just takes to long to get the code i could have walked to my nearest gamestop by now
1,The code already used,The code was already used when I tried using it. I wasted over $18 on nothing. Very upset. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO LOOSE MONEY
2,Speed of receiving the CODE is Wrong,"Ordered the 4000 point Card, Amazon said would have code in 90 sec. Well still waiting, and it's been over 2 hours. Could have ran to Walmart and back by now."
5,What else can I say?,"I don't quite know how and why to review this product, but here goes...I enjoy adding points to my xBox live account and spending them on neat games and add-ons, and I could never have done this without the product."
5,AWESOME SELLER!!!!,The product was top notch and their quick response to the questions I had were quick and very helpful! I would definitely purchase from them again! :-) Thanx!
5,so easy to use,"will definitely purchase points this way again! don't have to get out and go to the store lol. Found out about this product from xbox, and now wont ever go back to the stores to buy again"
5,Awesome,Really cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Got the code right when i Bought it :) I loved it!! i will be buying from these people again
5,Great and Speedy,"Great and Speedy Download, I am very pleased! I couldn't ask for any faster or better of service. It was a simple as pay and then download the code. Nothing is easier than that !! woooooo"
4,g0od,works good no problem every thoing workdwel wvery happy customer thnk again and will b uy again thnk you sir
1,Code did not work.,"I ordered two of these on the same day, one of the codes did not even work. Wasted $20 on it."
1,2 - 4 Hours for processing? Really? Thought this was a convenience.,"Instant Xbox points! NOT. I should have gotten in the car and drove to wallmart.Upon buying the downloadable xbox points, amazon indicated that I needed to wait 2-4 hours for verification. It would have been extremely cool of them to provide that little piece of information up front.Pretty Grumpy."
5,Easy Peasy,"What else can you say? Easier than going to the store,you can give it as a gift and it works great!"
5,Hubby loves these points,"My husband is a gamer, hardcore! Every once in a while I buy him some points towards his purchases. He loves them"
4,Awesome,"I love buying these. Convienient, easy, I don't have to waste gas to go to gamestop, and I don't waste plastic buying the ones there. Just wish I didn't have to put in my card every single time. The only reason it loses a star."
3,hey guys,does this work let me know asap i wanna know before i buy this item so please comment so i can know
5,"Mega Man 9.... Nuff said..... (okay, Bionic Commando!)","Great product, great price!Buy Mega Man 9 and Bionic Commando today!!Easy to use, and these games are great!"
2,1600 M$ Points,"It's 1600 M$ points. You to add these points to your xbox live account and spend them in the Xbox Live marketplace. For their price they should buy more, but unfortunately they are from Micro$oft so they are overpriced and don't get you much."
1,cant use a gift card,"I am only 14 so I don""t have a credit card and my parents wont use theirs to buy this but i got a $100 gift card from my grandmother for hanukkah and now I cant buy this because I can't afford to buy the actual card because i only have $23 left so I can't pay for shipping. Amazon should really allow you to use gift cards for this."
1,DO NOT USE,"When I placed my order I saw that a couple of people had given the buying experience bad reviews. I don't like putting my credit card on the Xbox because unlike the PS3 I can't figure out how to get the information off of it once it is put on it. So I figured this would be a good way to buy points and not have to give my info to Microsoft. However, as others have stated, it does not work. I placed my order, it said processing for about 5 minutes then said it is taking longer than expected and I should make sure my order was placed. When I look in my orders it shows as being placed, but I have no code of any kind. So my credit card is charged $50 and I don't have any points. Now I will have to make calls to customer service to find out how to get my code. For some reason I am missing how this is suppose to be more convenient."
5,Simple Enough,"I paid for the product. I entered the code on Live. I got exactly what I paid for, and for a dollar less than in any store. Sounds pretty good to me."
4,A Must have,A must have to use for online gaming addons.1600 points is more than sufficient to download many of the map packs and gaming add ons in most shooters.
3,i dont get it,why cant you just email us the code??? like wouldn't that be easier for you and the customer?? i probably wouldnt do this again
5,Quick and easy Way to Get Points,"Nothing much to say but i got my points code via email quickly, didn't have a single problem."
5,Great option for purchase,This was a quick way to get something for my grandson which he wanted and could use instantly!I was very pleased.
4,easy to access and use,"You can purchase these live points on Amazon, and you will immediately be shown your code which you can use for yourself or gift to someone else if you want to. The process of purchasing on line from Amazon is easy and the price is competitive. It's just the whole concept of paying for this in general that gripes me."
5,better than using a credit card,I like this method because it keeps my credit cards off my xbox live account which could end up being used by microsoft to auto-renew. Most don't realize whenever they release an update it resets it to auto-renew and keeping a credit card off it prevents them from doing so.
5,just what i needed,Needed this for some skyrim dlc and got it fast .faster than some other sites to be sure . now off to play skyrim
5,xbox 360 Live points,Bought this as a gift for my nephews....the love it! Makes me the favorite aunt so I too love it!
5,Great value!!!!,I was really pleased with being able to instantly download the points and will being going this route for future purchases.
5,Fast and amazing,I was amazed by Amazon's digital service. It was really fast and helpful since its hard to get a microsoft points card at where i live. The code came on right after the purchase as well as it was sen to my email! Loved it thank you amazon!
5,They are what they are,This is the best price for Microsoft points. The code is easy to use and it gets the job done. It is what it is.
2,Not User Friendly,Shame on me this time to purchase this organizer. It's not user friendly and the touch pad is difficult at times. I do not recommend it.
4,"Pretty Good, But Not The Best Wiggles Video","We have all the Wiggles videos and each one is a little different, but this one (the latest available in the U.S.) is maybe too different for our taste. There's more talking, less dancing and singing. Also, the ""weird"" songs are even weirder on this video. However, I don't think you can ever go wrong with the Wiggles, so I would still recommend this video. If you are just getting into Wiggles, the best videos are Wiggle Time, Toot Toot and Yummy Yummy. Wake Up Jeff and Dance Party are older, but still very good. I'm sure with time, this video will grow on us too."
5,Wiggles teaching harmony in the world,"This is a very unique Wiggles video. It is quite different from the others released previous but it is still a great video. As the title hints, ""Wiggly, Wiggly World"" this video contains many ""different"" songs, songs from around the world. Graphics and imagery on this video is more high tech than those videos preceeding it. Most of the songs are not as jump up & down, wiggle your hips, move around songs as we're used to in the videos Toot Toot, Wiggle Time, Yummy, Yummy and the rest but they're just as great. They're beautiful, harmonic and very well sung. Special guests are throughout this video assisting the great pre-school educators/singers/Wiggles inform and perform these wonderful songs. I would recommend this video to anyone, Wiggle fan or not. But I would warn the Disney Playhouse watching Wiggle fan that this video teaches of world harmony and not what has been shown on Disney to date. It's well worth the money but not what you'd expect."
5,Pandora Tomorrow,"This game is a really really good game. It has awesome graphics, the controls are great once you get used to them. The only thing is that it is really dark, but then it has to be. I thought it was really easy but it had some hard parts to it especially the last level. Probably the best game I have ever gotten, worth the money."
