1,One Star,I didn't really like Red Lily. Even less then I disliked Blue Dahlia. I don't know what it was about this book but I just didn't find myself connecting with charactors Hayley and Harper were okay but not very memerable. The ghost story wasn't very exciting and I didn't care for the conclusion. I guess this just wasn't my cup of tea.
1,Save your mixer!,"As another reviewer noted, this is dangerous to the health of your Kitchen Aid mixer. In fact,I burned out the motor with my mixer, a gift of only two months. Even the literature that accompanies the kit insists that you let the machine cool off between uses, which suggests Kitchen Aid knows there's a problem."
2,Product not up to par,"The book that was ordered did come in a timely manner however it came damaged, As a collecter of Sylvia Browne Books I keep my collection in prosteen condition and this one sticks out like a sore thumb."
3,"MEDIUM, and SUPERSIZE IT!","PHENOMENON is packed with new,stories and perspectives from Miss Browne, though many seem strangely familiar. One wonders how she can ""read"" people on the spot, and even after this effort, the question lingers -- who or what is the source for predictions, for instance? Still, this is one of Miss Brown's better books."
3,"Good, but could be better","Sylvia Brown has done a respectable presentation of the psychic arts, however, as a professional myself, I would have enjoyed more developement of each category. Nice introduction book for the first timer. If I may be so bold as to toot my own horn, I wrote the first ""layman's guide"" about ""Selecting Your Psychic"". It was published in 1989, but you can buy a copy for a bargain, $1 from Amazon. The book introduces a ""brief history of the prophetic arts"" along with usual information about psychics and their specialties. Enjoy your psychic journey!"
3,Mag Warriors are OK,"I have purchased 2 Mag Warriors. They are very hard to put together. But once you do, there pretty cool. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together. I actually had to use a hammer! I wouldn't suggest this toy for younger children. It's more for the ages for 9-13. Overall, there an OK toy."
2,It sort-of works,"This is the second one I recieved. The first one did not work at all. In order to allow the cutting wheel to cut the can lid, you must push the can into the can opener while it is spinning around. It works well enough to keep using, but just barely."
5,My Kitchen Aid Can Opener,"I purchased a kitchen aid can opener I have bought many regular can openers and since I have the Mixer I thought, it's been good so when my regular can opener played out I purchase it new only a good cook would enjoy the synificate of it. Its easy to use and I leave my can opener on the front of my mixer I use it alot wouldn't go back to a regular one at all. Thanks Kitchen Aid for your invention very pleased with the can opener attachment. Waiting to purchase more attachments."
2,Not a clean cutter,"After you finally get the can attached, you must push it up and let it complete about 3-4 complete turns before the can is completely opened"
1,Poor design / quality,"Worst Kitchenaid attachment ever, we are on number 3, all covered by warranty and now have asked for our money back, for almost $40.00 I can find a lot better can opener without the headaches."
1,Over rated- over priced- under performing,I bought this thing for my mother because of limited counter space. I thought it would be a really heavy duty and long lasting kitchen tool. Sadly it lasted for about 2 months of daily used before it failed. The failing was related to tolerances between the wheel and cutter depth. I was very disappointed when she had me look at it for possible repair. It is a riveted together and stamped steel piece of crap. Surely not worth what was paid for it by half. Save your money.
5,Good condition,Book is in good condition and my baby loves it!!! It is well worth the money spent on it and I would recommend it to anyone with small children.
5,The Foot Book by Dr. Suess,This book is one of a kind! It's colorful and creative! It goes to show that opposites do attract! I would recommend it for any young first beginners in reading!
1,Terrible adaptation of original,"The original book is NOT about opposites. It a clever funny, rhythmical book about ... feet. But when adapting it for a board book they decided to make it useful, and so changed the wording to fit an imposed theme. This is not Dr. Suess. This is a publishers way to make a few extra bucks from unsupecting customers. But the original."
5,Foot Book,"When I first gave birth, the hospital gave me the FOOT BOOK as a complimentary gift to take home. I began reading it when my daughter was real little, still too young to speak, and when she started speaking, she would say, ""Left foot, left foot, right foot right, feet in the morning, feet at night."" Too cute. So, as a learning aid, read this book."
3,The Foot Book,The reason I liked this book was because of how Dr. Seuss used rhyming words throughout the book. Dr. Seuss wrote his books as a fun way of learning. I recommend this book to anyone who has children.
4,Good warm-up for young toddlers,"For a while my daughter (22 months at the time of this review) had no interest in Dr Seuss, but slowly she is warming up to it. This book's board book format that she can carry around works for her better in this case. She is still indifferent to a big hardcover collection that we have, probably because she is not allowed to handle it by herself. It's still not something that she brings me to read often, that's why she completely takes me by surprise by randomly quoting parts of it. Her favorite page is about quick feet and slow feet. Again, I expect this book to have a long lasting life in her library"
5,the foot book,A great classic for the children and it just wouldn't be the same if a child did not have books like this to grow up with.
3,great when you can get it,"Amazon took forever to finish my shipment. They took so long that they eventually emailed me to ask if I wanted to approve the delay. I was busy that week and as it turns out, the default answer for approving a delay is ""no."" They cancelled my order leaving me with an incomplete set. Luckily the color was still available but I had now missed the sale price which customer service didn't seem willing to extend to me.The ones that arrived were nice, however. They're quite soft and have held together well. I'd recommend them if you're patient and watch your email carefully.... or if you find them elsewhere."
4,Thank God for The Promised Land!,Here is a book that has many pegs on which to hang Biblical principles. Not only is it an exciting read but it is a great teaching tool. I like the way one character finds his way into all three books written by Randall Arthur. Well done!
5,geat show,liked all the action and if people like myself like serials they will like this too so thanks so much
1,Waste of money,"Not clicking to the bowl, jumping of the bowl while mixing, creates more mess. NO use, after trying few times!"
3,Pouring Shield,"I was disappointed with the small opening to be used for adding ingredients, as well as the large opening which still allows for splashes. It is, however, better than no shield being used."
4,Handy to have for the family that cooks together,The pouring shield is the #1 accessory you want if you're cooking with kids! It leaves a much smaller gap between the bowl in the mixer almost eliminating the temptation to stick their hands in. Not to mention the reduction of the stuff missing the bowl when they add it.
1,don't waste your money,Don't waste your money. The pour shield is engineered with openings along the edge which allow the flour or liquids to still gush all over. (I got one for my 4 1/2 qt. Kitchen Aid stand mixer)
4,update the picture,"I read all the reviews before ordering this and before the person commented that it is now a 1-pc item. The picture shows a 2 pc. and a lot of the reviewers seem to be reviewing the 2 pc. I was disappointed because I expected what was in the picture and description. I credit the seller for saying I could return it but: 1. Why hassle with the return if the seller had nothing to replace it with and 2. this is apparently the only one Kitchen Aid is shipping.I might luck up and find a seller that has the older, 2 pc. shield. If so, I'll buy it as I think this one will get scratched and ratty with the regular use.The 1 pc. has a HUGE opening at the back. So while it might keep flour and other stuff from getting on you or the cabinet, it can still escape through that HUGE opening and get the mixer dirty/dusty.I have used it and right now, I'm undecided. It's not bad but I really want the one in the picture.Really, Amazon, update the photo!"
3,Lefties beware...,"I have used the pouring shield several times and it is very useful. If I don't use it the flour in the recipe comes flying back out as I'm mixing. However, the newer version of it (I bought mine in Sept. 09) is right-handed. It is a one piece pouring shield that only fits on the mixer with the spout facing to the right, so I have to add all ingredients right-handed, which is not so easy when pouring a boiling sugar mixture into the mixer."
3,Never got to use it,"I can't actually say how well this product works, because I didn't get to use it. The information above states that it fits all 4 1/2 and 5 quart KitchenAid stand mixers, but in fact it does not, and this is Amazon's mistake, not KitchenAid's When I recieved it, I found that it is much too small for my KV25GOX model mixer. When I looked at the box to see if I had made a mistake, I found that it clearly states that this accessory fits all 4 1/2 and 5 quart stand mixers *except* model KV. So if you're still interested in this product, make sure it's compatible before you spend your money."
2,BEWARE RESTOCKING FEE,"I ordered this item as a gift, but ended up needing to return it, unopened. The item actually comes from DiscountJungle, and they charge a 15% restocking fee!! So be sure you want this before you order it!"
1,Pasta my foot!,"This item sounds like it will work but BUYER BEWARE!As the noodles come out they run back together.I am a professional in the business and have tried everything, including letting the noodles fall into a bowl of flour to keep them separated but nothing seems to work. Definitely a BAD idea by Kitchen Aid."
3,Pasta Maker,Great product...except it did not come with the stomper. You need the stomper to make the pasta...so make sure that you get the pasta maker with the stomper.
1,So sorry I bought this attachment!,"There is a reason most pasta machines have the noodles come out horizontally - so they don't get all stuck together. I was up almost all night trying to get the noodles separated, by hand, one-by-one and on to the drying rack without breaking. This attachment was a huge disappointment and I couldn't care less about the meat grinder. Another problem was black grease all over my hands and I never did find the source. What a mess!"
3,pasta noodles stick together - A LOT!,"For the price, this attachment isn't horrible, BUT the holes it shoots the pasta out are very close together and it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to keep the noodles from touching each other and sticking together. I ended up cooking mostly clumps of noodles. Honestly? If you are really serious about buying an attachment to make pasta, spend the money and get thisKitchenAid KPRA Pasta Roller Attachment for Stand MixersIt's worth every penny, in my humble opinion."
2,PASTA MAKER,"I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M COMPLETLEY SASTIFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.THE KITCHENAID FELT EXTREMELY WARM AFTER MAKING A 1/2 BATCH OFPASTA, I THOUGHT THE MOTOR MIGHT FIZZLE OUT IF THE WHOLE BATCH WAS MADE AT ONCE! WITH THE TIME/PREP/CLEAN UP INVOLVED, BUY THE NOODLES IN THE STORE!"
1,waste of money,"Stop Be For You Buy!!!! Should have saved my money. Making pasta with this machine is disappointing. The recipe given with the instructions is way to sticky to run through the extruder. I redid the dough 3 times before I was able to extrude it, and still it stuck together. I should have listened to the rest of the reviews, but having owned a pasta maker/extruder before I thought it would be a piece of cake. If I were you I would invest in the roller pasta maker for you mixer. On the bright side though...The food grinder is wonderful."
4,a space saving spare bowl,"This smaller bowl nests inside the original mixer bowl that comes with the 4.5 quart pivot-head kitchenaid mixer, so you can store all of your bowls, and the basic attachments (barely) on the mixer stand without taking up valuable cupboard space.Unlike the 4.5 quart bowl, this bowl doesn't have a handle, which may matter more than you think when you're twisting the bowl out of the mixer socket. Recipes that tend to ""creep up"" the mixer bowl sides will also creep right out of this one, so it may not be the best choice for all cooks."
1,They Don't Fit!,I even checked with KitchenAid about which ones were correct for our mixer and they apparently gave us the wrong code. I join everyone here - why can't they make standard bowl covers? This is crazy!
4,Type of mixers,Just of FYI for those planning to buy these. There are 2 types of 5 qt mixers one have a pivot head and the other the bowl lifts . These are for the 5 qt professional mixer with the bowl lift.
2,Lacks battery longetivity and blades don't penetrate dogs thicker fur,"I purchased this unit through a dog catalog. I loved the idea of having the option of both cordless or corded, but mainly wanted the freedom for cordless trimming, so I could make the mess outdoors. The trimmer fits nicely in the hand. Although I am able to trim my Affenpinscher's face and ear area to some extent, it doesn't quite get through some of her thick fur. I also attempted to trim my Norfolk Terrier's coat as well, but it wound up VERY uneven. I wound up resorting to scissors, which defeats the purpose of why I bought the trimmer in the first place.If you want a trimmer that basically is for a quick touch-up, this would be for you. The battery died quickly on me. I would say I didn't get more than 15 minutes of trimming time. I guess I'll have to revert back to my old corded trimmer.I highly recommend the Oster name. The brand has always been a reliable one."
3,Pretty basic but OK,"A prior review said ""coils"" - yep, lots of those. The projects are basic and can be accomplished by a beginner. Experienced metal-workers will likely find this too basic, but there are some ideas that could be incorporated into other designs.I find myself wishing that the author had waited a bit longer than her proclaimed 18 months before setting out to write the book on wire-working. More experience might yield a greater diversity of techniques and more developed design aesthetics.Don't get me wrong - this is a good starting place. But there are lots of starting places in the wire-working ouvre and this might not be the best out there."
1,Creative Wiire Jewelry,"I read through this book and was so dissatisfied with the quality of the designs and the cheap materials suggested that I relisted my copy on Amazon the next day. Not worth the trouble. I wish the author had taken the time to learn more before writing the book. The techniques taught were not always the standard process, and would produce a lower quality end result. A shame she got published in an discipline where more creative projects would be appreciated."
5,Desert Island book...,"If I had to choose 10 books that I would bring with me to a desert island, this would be one of them."
5,I have loved this book for over thirty years.,"I encountered this book in 1969, and have reread it many times. I recently quoted from it in a report to the school board in an attempt to encourage continuation of an outdoor classroom that has been established in the district. I recently loaned it to a colleague, and am sad that it is out of print. Perhaps it is time for Sierra Club to reprint this inspiring book."
3,A Mediocre Movie Grows From a Great Book,"The cast in this movie is exceptional, and the book is among the author's (W. Somerset Maugham) best, but somehow something got very, very lost in the translation and the movie is merely okay. I don't know why, exactly. It's been said that Maugham is extremely difficult to translate onto the screen, and this movie is Exhibit A. My advice: buy the book and sit back for a great, luxurious read. Skip the movie."
1,Check Your Mixer!,"My bowl just arrived and despite the item description, it does not fit my 5 quart Professional. I had no idea there are multiple bowl sizes for my mixer type. It would be helpful to include this information in the item description.The rating given is not for the bowl itself- it's lovely- but for the product description."
5,K5ASBP Bowl,"As I do a lot of baking during the Christmas season, my KitchenAid 5 quart mixer really cuts the time and energy it takes to make a lot of cookies, and other such Christmas treats. The only thing that would be better, I thought, was an extra bowl, so I could expidite the process. My husband bought me this bowl as an early Christmas present, and I love it!!! I got through the Christmas season of baking in no time at all. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to bake, and does a lot of it."
3,"Good part, but wrong size.","Listed to work with 1991 Mercury Grand Marquis. However, the diameter of the larger gear was much smaller then what came off the car."
1,Kodak = Garbage,"Purchased 5500 in May 2008. Have always experienced the ""phantom ink"" issue which seems to be a common issue. In it's entire life it has probably printed out 20 pictures. The pictures were of decent quality but since CVS and other places allow you to upload pictures, print, and pick up from store for so cheap it hasn't been used in a while. I have a HP Deskjet that is probably 10-15 years old that prints all my black and white documents just fine. I pulled the 5500 out to scan a document recently. That's all I need it for, so why in the world does the ""all-in-one"" demand that I refill the ink. It literally does not function without ink cartridges full of ink. I want to scan the document and save it as a .pdf file. Can't do it with ink. Ink that I don't want to waste my money on. Kodak is right about one thing, their ink is cheap. Cheap little containers of crap."
2,"Good features, but can't get it to work with Time Capsule","This all in one printer, has all the good stuff(scan, print, fax, copy), but I can't get this to work with Apple's Time Capsule. And, what I learnt searching on the net, is that Kodak does not support wireless printing. I can print, if I have my macbook connected directly to the printer.So, if you are looking at using a printer, in conjunction with Time capusule, this is not it."
1,Just a waste of money and time.,"Set the printer up. Copied one document 40 times, and got an error message that the head was not installed correctly. Checked it and re installed it as instructed, still same problem. Called and spent an hour with Kodak on the phone, when they finally said needed a new print head. A week later the new head arrived, same problem. Today have spent an hour and a half with them, repeating everything three times to people whose primary language is NOT English. Now I have to prove that I purchased it within the past year to see if the printer is under warranty. My next step is to put it in the garbage can and go on with my life."
1,total disappointment,"i purchased this printer and it was dead out of the box, it infuriated me to start by having to modify everything on the printer, is this just a update to an older model? who ever heard of having to install a keyboard cover , printhead and two side adapter? then the customer service, WHAT A JOKE! after sitting on hold for 45 minutes never getting thru, a email reply of ""we are very busy and will get in touch with you as soon as possible"" (still waiting) then after waiting on hold for 20 more minutes the tech told me "" its a bad unit return it to where you bought it"" what? ""can you send me a new unit instead? "" nope a refurbished unit only was offered. IT NEVER WORKED OUT OF THE BOX! and the store I bought it at, doesn't carry it any more , won't be restocking it. so Kodak will never see another cent of my money DON""T BUY IT!"
3,Dont Buy Refurb,"I bought this printer from amazon warehouse deals. When I recieved the printer, it was missing parts. It would not feed one sheet of paper. It sounded like a bomb going off. I returned it and bought another one from Circut City. In the end everything worked out fine. Overall, It is a great printer."
1,tobacco cards,It was not what we were looking for. We wanted sports cards and this was mainly girly cards. We put it in the trash.
2,Too many inaccuracies to be believable,"I was unable to complete this book because the author's credibility approached zero by about page fifty due to numerous factual errors. I cannot be ""transported to Stalingrad"" if most every time a historical fact is stated, it is incorrect.I found the characters overly romantic and idealized. They are not real people, they're characters invented by the author to manipulate the reader down an emotional path.I'm very disappointed that I purchased this book."
2,Not what I expected,"I wanted to read this book beacause of the title. I thought it would present an account of the war from the ordinary soldier's experiences, not just a focus on the sniper's part in the battle. You can read a summary of the hell that was Stalingrad in Alan Clark's ""Barbarossa"" in the conclusion of the chapter ""Verdun on the Volga"".The comments of the German lieutenant in two paragraphs says it all."
2,Disappointed,"I have heard of this book over the years and thought it would be a good read. Having read a lot about Stalingrad and the monumental struggle for the city, I thought this would be great. I am sure the story is fine but it did not fit in with what I believe to be true about the battle. I recommend some sniper biographys instead.Doug, Virginia"
1,A very disappointing book!,"I was looking forward to reading an interesting book on how the German and Russian Sniper hunted each other in Stalingrad. Instead this book has focused on how evil and stupid the Germans are and how intelligent and smart the Russians are during crucial battles in Stalingrad. Overall, this book was very disappointig and I am so glad that I borrowed this book from my local library!"
4,good value,"Good value for the money. Haven't used the strainer yet, but the other products work as advertised and clean up easily."
3,Overseas buyers do your homework,"Advice that not all KA products fit all KA mixers would have been great. I bought these attachments and luckily, these sort of....fit, There should be information that US attachments may not always fit o'seas mixers, they don't fit perfectly but so far I am able to use most of them, fingers crossed.As for the product, ofcourse it's great and no probs with delivery / condition etc."
3,The Jury is Still Out...,"These attachments seem less sturdy than I expected, I won't say cheap - as I haven't had any of them break. I will say that my everyday use of these attachments seem to approach the limits of what they are capable of handling. I expected more from KitchenAid, yet another sign of the times."
5,Great product !,"The motor provides plenty of power to grind and shred through just about anything, and the shredding/grinding blades seem to keep their edge quite nicely."
2,Not what was advertised,"These attachments are great. However, the package i recieved did not come with the wooden plunger that is pictured. You need to have this to use the food grinder, and the food strainer. Nothing else (like wooden spoons, etc.) work for this purpose. Make sure you ask about that wooden plunger if you decide to purchase.Other than that, the product would have been great and a great deal."
4,Kitchen Aid quality - cheapened slightly by the new plastic pusher,"The items seem solid and well designed as expected, although the new plastic plunger seems to cheapen the package. It is marketed as being more convenient and sanitary, but the wood gave it a quality touch. Another courseness screen for the strainer attachment would be welcome, and its recommended limitations in the literature seem a little offputting (niagara grapeskins (yes) versus concord (no)!?."
4,Excellent Addition to the Mixer,"We purchased the 3 pack of accessories which included the meat grinder, vegetable shredder and strainer. I have only used the grinder and shredder and it is really awesome. I shredded cheese on one instance and potato's for hashbrowns on another. Clean up was very easy. Looking forward to using the strainer for Tomato Sauce and Applesauce in the upcoming seasons. Also this was an excellent price for all 3 as they typically run $50+ excluding tax and time in the local stores... Do the math you get all 3 for $35 a piece.. To me, great buy for an excellent product !"
4,KitchenAid Attachments,Great price on the product from Amazon. Have only used the food grinder so far and it works fairly well. Had the course grinding plate missing but I contacted KitchenAid and they sent me one free of charge.Have used it to make my own burger mix and it does a good job if you follow the directions. Have to clean the grinder plate and blade when they get gunked up for muscle tissue but that is easy to do. After grinding my own burger mix I will not be buying it from the store anymore. Taste so much more like steak and no ground up bone to bite into and crack your teeth.
2,"get the food grinder if you have to and forget the extras, not worth the $$","Okay, I listened to the positive reviews on here, and ended up returning this accessory set. The attachments are virtually worthless if you have a food processor, and I could recommend several under the cost of this package that could do a MUCH better job. Also, the design is awkward, and prevents you from using these attachments easily or quickly. The time it took to attach the stuff wasn't worth it, if you have any alternative (even a knife!). Plus you still have to cut things in order to feed them through the opening.I give it two stars only because it has the food grinder. The food grinder was well constructed and I would consider that as a sole purchase if I was an avid meat eater! This set is simply not worth the money and is not highly-functional in design. I returned it."
2,not a useable tool,i bought this kit to make sausage and grind meat. it's not practial for this use. the meat grinder could not cut thru 5 lbs of pork. the sreader was ok. I returned this kit becouse I could not grind the meat to make sausage
2,Not a good accessory for this excellent mixer,"I purchased this set about 2 years ago. The shredders work OK, but it is easier and less mess to chop them by hand. Much of the produce gets caught between the housing and the shredder. It's difficult getting uniform cuts. The piece that is poorly designed is the meat grinder. I'm on my second grinder. Both the feeder shaft and the housing are constructed of a plastic molding on metal. Over a relatively short amount of use, they both began to crack apart at the unions. This of course is not good, being they are used on meat and it makes it almost impossible to clean. I would recommend going for a good sharp knife and a seperate all metal meat grinder (which I am now looking for)."
5,KitchenAid FPPA Mixer Attachment Pack for Stand Mixers,"I'm newly retired and learning how to cook main dishes and I'm spending time experimenting in the kitchen. My use of the pack components would be classified as lite useage and I've been more than satisfied. These kitchen utensiles would be worth their ""weight in gold"" if I had to prepare for a large group of guest. This will come later after I hone my cooking skills."
2,Not as good as what I thought,"I purchased these because in Australia this is very expensive compared to the States, but I made a mistake because the slicer, shredder is not very sharp and has also started rusting which is not normal for stainless steel food quality, Im not sure if this is a defective product or not but it was too late for me to return it as I only used it passed the return date. Im going to buy the Australian version because its 100% better Ive seen it in action and is very sharp and a lighter 18/10 stainless steel."
4,Hasn't changed much.,"I'm replacing a set given to me as a wedding gift 22 years ago. Some of the parts have been updated in design somewhat from the original product, however, the same problem is going to eventually occur. The plastic housing around the metal which inserts into the mixer is a stress area and will eventually crack. Owners of this unit who use it much will know what/where I mean. KitchenAid really needs to consider updating this design. My husband and I have a large garden and we also make our own sausage, burger, etc, so our unit gets used fairly often. I guess I got my original $99 worth, and the replacement was $118 so averaged over many years of use, the cost is not too bad."
1,defective product,"The meat grinder leaks. The shredder/ slicer is not effective. It cannot even thred the mini carrots. No comment on the strainer since I have not used it yet. Overall, a very dissapointing buy."
4,Great watch,"I rarely place reviews, unless something is very bad and people need to be warned or very good. This series is very good and if you have an interest in human survival, well worth watching. The show was made in 1973 to 1975 so is dated inasmuch as cloths, attitudes, etc., but the stories that make up each episode are engaging.I am still only one-third of the way through, having just watched series one, but I am really pleased that I have the box set with another two series. All up, there is something like 40 hours, so good value for money. Excellent and the only reason it is not a five star is because of the shows age."
1,LAME,"Says it's for 5 qt bowls but doesn't specify that it's for the lift stand KA bowls only, somewhat deceiving to me! Plus they made me pay to ship the item back and only refunded me the price of the lids. Very unhappy with purchase ;("
1,mixed bag,"I really wanted a cover for my bowl -for raising dough, covering things to be used later, etc. The dip in the lid makes storage hard and takes up a lot of space - bad design. I understand why it's there, but how many people store the lid and bowl together?"
4,Works well,I wanted covers for my kitchenaid because it is just easier than using foil or plastic wrap. I love this product. I have a 4 1/2 qt bowl and it fits perfectly. I wish the hole in the middle wasn't so deep (it pops out downward). Not sure what it is for. But the lids works for what I need.
4,The Down Syndrome Nutrition Handbook,"The book was very informative for families starting out with a young down syndrome child. The information was easy to follow and ""do-able"". I would recommend it highly to these families. Unfortunately, the information we needed was for an overweight adult with down syndrome. I have not found any books that deal with nutrition issues in adults with down syndrome. As with most books, we will use the information and try to adapt it to our situation."
5,Superb reading,"This is a great sequel to the excellent ""Game Keeper's Night Dog"", and the second in a ""must read"" trilogy for science fiction and alternate history enthusiasts. The author makes vivid and imaginative use of historical/industrial characters such as Winston Churchill, Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, the German hero-General Hindenburg, Rudolph Diesel, and Henry Ford - not to mention the emergence of the Zulu race as the world's preeminent aviators. Especially creative - building on the key role of the English Bulldog species of canines in ""Gamekeepers"" - is the evolution of intelligent birds, mammals, and anachronids and their mobillization as very new and different weapons of war. This volume concludes with an intriguing ""new technology"" battle, staged in the Hawaiian islands."
2,Transfer problems on disc 1,"Hello,I too have had the picure problems on Disc 1. It seems to be a digital transfer issue. I have emailed Universalstudios.com to complain and recommed all others that have this problem do so as well."
2,Hmm...should've checked the recent reviews,"I will be receiving my copy of the Special Edition DVD of The Meaning of Life, but I do wish I had read the reviews...I have found multiple places on the internet complaining of the same problem, notably severe interlacing-type lines, which I have seen for myself with a friend's copy. He returned his to the store. The defect is pretty bad, and is completely unacceptable by ANY standards. Universal has to recall these discs, as they are useless mini-frisbees at this point in time. Disc 2 is fine, it is the feature film disc that is the problem.Universal recalled discs from the Back to the Future boxed set because of mis-framing, so they should definitely recall this error. To see the problem, go to: http://www.shortfatguy.com/weblog.phpscroll down to the header ""Warning of Life"" and click ""expand"". There he has a screenshot of the problem.The movie itself is hilarious. This rating is based on the defect problem. I rate the film itself *****."
2,Possibly their worst,"I am a huge Monty Python fan, and believe that Holy Grail and Life of Brian are examples of true comic genius. Meaning of Life, however, is hardly funny. The long ""corporate raiders"" sequence in the beginning has great comic potential, but drags on far too long to be funny. Most of the jokes do have potential, and you know that the gags should be entertaining, but they didn't spark much amusement in me. It doesn't have the wonderful zany spontaneity of their other movies. I would not reccommend this movie to Monty Python fans, because it's quite disappointing."
1,Someone please take it out of my hands!,"I grew up watching ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" so when I saw this VHS for sale at the low cost of $1 I thought I was in for a treat. Unfortunately it was awful. I know their reputation is built on pushing the limits and nothing is too sacred, but this was disgusting and stupid. I have to be honest in admitting there were a couple of funny parts (when the Yorkshire father says he will sell his children for scientific experiments) but it was not worth the $1 I paid for it and I want it out of my house before my kids find it!"
1,Worst mastering I've ever seen,"I concur with all of the reviews below. There are major flaws with the mastering of this DVD. Any significant motion on the screen results in lines and bluriness on the moving object. This DVD is nearly unwatchable. I can't believe it was released in this state, and it should be recalled. I recommend staying away from this issue at all costs until this is fixed."
5,"An excellent collection of prayers and speeches by the late, great Pope John Paul II set to music","This CD seems to be out of print now, which is a real shame. I was able to pick up a copy at my local used bookstore for just under six dollars. This work can be described as a collection of the Holy Father's prayers and excerpts from speeches in several different languages, set to many different types of music. Gregorian chant, rhythms, Celtic, soft rock, and ""New Age"" style music are all used. A very relaxing album to listen to while in mental prayer or meditiation.I look forward to hearing a similar work using the voice of H.H. Benedict XVI, though I do not know if one is in the works."
1,Great Music this isn't. . . .,"Religion can clearly have a place in great music....Rock and Roll owes more than a little to it's Gospel roots. But this CD from the Pope is little more than background church music. It may be inspiring in a religious way to certain people, but listened to critically, it is little more than New Age at it's absolute worst."
3,Sharp edged handle is not for LARGE hands,"I wanted an extra 4.5 quart bowl for my antique KitchenAid mixer. The bowl is ok, but the handle is useless for people with large hands. Trying to squeeze my big hands into the small sharp edged handle is a painful exercise. This handle just gets in my way. I wish Whirlpool/KitchenAid still made the old bowl without the handle or made a replacement bowl with a softer and larger ergonomic handle. I find this handle very uncomfortable. This is not the bowl with an ergonomic handle.I maybe better off using regular mixing bowls with a hand mixer when needing additional whipping capacity."
3,handle with discomfort,"i like having an extra bowl, but the handle really is a pain, as other reviewers have mentioned. i'm not even bothered that it's a 1/2 qt smaller."
4,Very Pleased!,I purchased this used and was very pleased when I received it. The bowl was almost like new and heavier than the bowl I got with my KitchenAid mixer eleven years ago. I would order from the same company again if the need arises.
5,Glad I bought this,"Put together well, fits well, I dont know why I never bought a bowl with a handle beforeWith the handle I can rotate it off the machine with ease."
5,wait no longer,"I kept looking at this seat and thinking can it really be worth the money. Finally found it here at a great price and decided to purchase. I'm so glad I did. Not only is the passager seat a lot wider than the stock seat on my vulcan 900, the drivers seat is way more comfortable too. Don't wait an longer. It's worth it!"
3,Blah,"This book is ok... I really wish that it was spiral bound. I also really wish that the radiograph they are referencing to was on the same page; it's difficult and confusing to have to flip back and forth. Really, each radiograph should have had it's own page with the description, even if it meant adding more pages. Also, the book is too small and flimsy."
3,A basic dental radiography book that works,"Required for my OSU dental classes and is quite competant. It does, however, seem to just restate everything in the other books by these authors"
5,Great grinder,Be careful - don't start wheat grinding with full pressure - it will hurt you and the machine. Crack the wheat first and then put in back through at least twice more adding more pressure each time until fine flour.
4,Worth the price ?,"Generally I've been satisfied with all Kitchen Aid attachments, but this one is a little different. For the price I could buy myself a stand alone grain mill with more features and save the load on my beloved workhorse."
4,Nice overview,"This text is a nice, clear introduction to the various methods for time frequency analysis for engineers. The proofs are more detailed than in some other texts, though there were some errors or typos. I liked this book better than the other one that I have, Time Frequency Analysis by Leon Cohen, which is somewhat out of date (wavelets are referred to as scale here) and also has minor errors in the proofs."
3,Killzone's Way Better!!!!!!!!!!!,"jungle storm is too tactical. one shot and ur dead. I really like UT2k4, Call of Duty, bf:vietnam, etc so I cant say I loved this one. ( u cant even see ur gun!) But, it isn't much worse than those t rated 3rd person shooters (Jak 2, Rachet & Clank, etc.) so id give it credit."
4,Expensive Heavy Duty Chain,"I was short some chain for haning a light fixture (I had to ""swag"" it), so, after some searching, I found this one. The color matched perfectly, and the chain is very good quality - I could probably use it to drag a small car... That being said, I think I spent almost as much for the additional chain as I did for the light fixture."
2,Very hard book to understand and read-aloud,This book is difficult to understand and read-aloud unless if you're from the South. The slang and dialect can get to you after a while and it can be quite annoying. The story line is okay. I was rather disappointed overall. My children weren't crazy about this either. The illustrations are nice. Definitely not our favorite book. We're now loving Gooseberry Park instead.
4,Think you would like Strawberry Girl.,"I think Strawberry Girl was a really good book. The Boyers just moved in next door to neighbors that think the Boyers are boasting because they have more than their neighbors. After a little bit into the story they start feuding. Birdie Boyer wants to become friends witht her neighbors but does she? That's for me to know, and you to find out. ..."
4,works great,i had to fab some mounts on it to match up to my heater. the only thing i wish i would have known before i got this was measurements of the bolts and mounts. also a picture of the back would have been nice.
1,excerpt indeed !,i couldnt wait to hear this because i love the mans voice hiscadence the power of his speech and the beauty of his message-- my fave speech was always the one he so prophetically made the day b4 his untimely and devastating murder--the one where he says i may not be there with ya --i have been to the mountaintop--etc---- i was devastated and appalled at the snippet of this speech which left out the best parts ! we do not hear him say i may not be there with ya-- we basically hear two sentences ! which totally leaves out the miraculous part- who put this thing together ? or who took it apart ? -- shame on you whoever you are ---very very strange indeed --not to mention outrageously disappointing --
2,Don't do it,"Very little substance. You can't get ""into"" the speeches because the excerpts are more like sound bites. Look for a better deal."
1,Time Lost Forever,"There's no doubting Bondi's credentials or the potentiality of his thesis on the common-sense derivation of special relativity from Newtonian physics, but Bondi fails on two basic fronts:1) The bulk of his presentation relies on a cumbersome supposition (graphical and otherwise) involving several characters moving through space and time to prove that time is a route-dependent quantity. If the reader wants to truly understand Bondi's theory, he or she should plan to sit down with a chalk board or a paper and pen in order to keep the character's names and their travels straight.2) The basis for the presentation is so tedious that eventually one reaches the point of sensory overload and, as a result, ends up accepting the conceptual foundation of Bondi's theory as is -- which is no different than taking Einstein's special theory of relativity at face value. In other words, for this reader, Bondi fails to convincingly derive special relativity from Newtonian physics."
4,Some Top Quality Polka Music,"While I would agree, Yankovic's ""Songs of the Polka King, Volume 1"" is probably the best I've heard, this is quite a good album. It contains excellent versions of Tic Toc Polka, Baby Doll Polka, and Cafe Polka. An added bonus is the addition of Joey Miskulin as second accordian and some vocals. At this price, you're crazy not to buy if you like polkas at all! It's a great mix. The only reason I give it four stars is because some of the recording quality is less than perfect, otherwise, this is a great album."
5,yogourmet extra batch jar,"made of very good material. cover fits very well on the jar as well as the jar fitting very well in the yogourt maker.a fine product, to be recommended to friends."
2,love the maker but..,"We have used our yogourmet yogurt maker 1-2 times every week for 14 years. We recently purchased two extra batch jars to replace the original. Unfortunately, the new jars are lighter weight and the lids fit VERY poorly. This makes it very tricky to lift the batch jar out of the maker and can easily result in your wonderful yogurt landing all over the kitchen floor. One of the two new batch jars is out of round, so the lid really does not fit at all - it just rests on top. But the yogurt is still good - we just have to be really, really careful how we lift the jar up."
3,"A classic, for better or worse","PROS:- Treatment of just about everything, from rules of inference to foundations of mathematical logic.- A ""concise"" handbook excellently laid out and organized.CONS:- Poorly written: unnecessarily convoluted grammar and sentence structure make some relatively simple issues tough to understand at first. It is NOT a cliche that philosophers are some of the worst writers in academia.- Some sections have ridiculously long exercises (validity proofs well into the 50 steps); others have practically none."
3,"Looks nice, but....","This ring looks nice, but in person it is a bit big and masculine looking for a woman. Quality appears to be pretty good and sizing seems right as well. The image makes it look more delicate than it is. I still like it though and have worn it almost every day since I bought it. (I had no problems with the seller and it arrived a day before expected delivery)."
5,Perfect fit,I bought this for my 1994 Jeep Cherokee Sport because the original rear window arm broke off. The price is reasonable and much less than the OEM part from a dealer. It fits and works perfectly.
5,No pulp and easy to clean!,This is my first juicer and I love it! It leaves no pulp. It's easy to disassemble/reassemble. It cleans easily with a quick rinse. Even the basket cleans easily with my vegetable brush. And the tip on soaking the components in a bleach solution to remove stains was wonderful. This is a good buy.
4,Not bad... not mind blowing...,"Easy to attach to a cymbal stand, and the nut stays tight instead of slowly loosening like some wingnuts. It's fine with a loud china if your only using it for crashing. I have a vintage Zildjian Pang china-type cymbal that I tried with this recently, and while it's fine for crashing, there is some vibration noise when using mallets or using the cymbal as a ride (this Pang sounds great as a ride!) It's probably not detectable to someone ten feet away, but it's annoying. Maybe Aquarian should consider adding a felt core to help dampen the noise...Overall, these are great for china cymbals and/or rides that get hit hard. Probably helps prevent damage...Note: If you're playing new Zildjian cymbals, you're probably going to crack them no matter what. They're pretty, but even if they don't sound like crap, they will fall apart. They don't make them like they used to. Buy used, vintage gear for half the price!"
3,Jamie and Claire = Soulmates,Amazing twists and turns in the storyline - keeps me engaged. The books in this series are large 900+ pages but they draw you in and before you know it you have completed one and can't wait to crack the next one. 20 years since Jaime and Claire married and their love is stronger than ever.
2,Even Babe Ruth struck out from time to time,"Much as I love this series, this is far and away the weakest book in the saga. Had this been the first book of Ms. G's that I read, it would have been the last.For whatever reasons, (rush to publication, too many cooks spoiling the broth, aliens replacing the author with a duplicate) DOA is a more apt acronym than you might think. My exact complaints are outlined by earlier customer reviews of Allchans and Reedwstle, so I won't belabor the point. I found the book tedious, dramatically different in style than the first 3 and if it weren't the 4th of 6 books, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. If DOA is your first taste of the series, I beseech you to give the others a try before writing Jaime/Claire/etc off.----Now, on to casting the film, what about Liam Nielson for Jaime? And what about his wife, Natasha Richardson, as Claire?"
4,Drums of Autumn by Diana Gabaldon,"I'm enjoying this series of books on CD one by one. This book is the first used one of the series I've purchased. There was some skipping on one of the CD's. Otherwise, I have no complaints"
3,I was so enthralled with,the first set of books and then when I got to this one I was bored and didn't really want to finish. Its like the air went out of the balloon.
2,Claire's Story Gets Lost,"This book is just not as good. I loved Claire's story with Jamie. And for that reason, Outlander is still my absolute favorite in this series, and one of my all-time favorite books. Unfortunately, as the series has progressed, Claire's story has become lost.This book was primarily about Brianna and Roger, who are flat characters and not that interesting. The manner in which the perspectives switched from Claire's first person narration to third person with everyone else interrupted the flow of the book and was annoying.Furthermore, the plot was not as exciting as the other three books I have read thus far. I think I would recommend stopping at Voyager (with the caveat that I haven't read Fiery Cross or Breath of Snow and Ashes)."
5,Another winner,"Diana Gabaldon's Scots romances are unparalleled. In this 4th book, she shows her ability to keep aging characters strong and interesting and introduces new blood to the plot lines. The character studies remain the strength of her book, although Clare's daughter comes off a little stupid in this one. Diana trades the Highlands for Colonial America giving a fresh glimpse into pre-revolutionary war pioneer life."
5,the outlander series is just a great reading,these book are prefect for summer reading nothing like taking your best friends to the beach or just to sit in the back yard. this entire series is just great I am already planning on rereading the whole set of books
3,getting a bit formulaic,"Still enjoying the yarns, but not as gripping as the earlier novels in the series. Jamie has become a predicatable cutout; the female characters less so, the history still interesting. Hey - but I read it all and bought the next one!"
3,RAPE....AGAIN????,This was turning out to be the best of Diana Gabaldon's storytelling so far until well into the book she pulled the old rape card and turned it into a very bad soap opera. What a shame.
5,It is a fantastic book,"I cant believe she has not finished it yet. A colleague of mine couldnt put it down and sat up late and finished it at 2:15 AM. Dont miss this book, read it NOW"
1,pretty darn dumb,This book is SOOOOOOOOO dumb! No plot. No depth to the characters. Not easy to understand (and I read lots and lots of books!) There. That's why I don't like it.Believe me: this ain't the best book.
4,Drums of Autumn,"this is a great series. it has it all love, history, sex, and sadness. They are long but worth the read."
2,Nothing special,"I think I'm still a little burned out on the romance novels, but I wanted a light, fluffy read. And I definitely got it. Light, fluffy, predictable, shallow. Your typical mid-quality romance novel. Not the worst I've ever read, but nowhere near the best, either."
5,My special bread making purchase,"I purchased the 41/2 quart Kitchen Aide just to make home made bread. I have never regreted the money spent. ....I still knead my dough after using the mixer, just to keep my hands in the dough."
5,My wife loves me !,"Until I bought the Almond Cream Kitchen Aid KSM90PS Stand mixer for her, I was clearly in the dog house. This did it ! She absolutely loves the darn thing. I now get mashed potatoes, and baked cakes, and the cooking is dramatically better.Thanks Kitchen Aid !"
2,Disappointed with KitchenAid 4 1/2 Quart Mixer,Started using mixer in 2002...in Dec. 2004 had to take it in for service...all the oil had leaked out. Was told I didn't use it enough! Nearest authorized service center is 35 miles away. I threw away a 30 year old GE mixer when I purchased this one...wish I had it back. (I must now order a new cover since the old one is stained on four sides by oil.)
2,Lasting Quality? Not Quite...,"I bought one of these about 7 years ago because a friend of mine told me hers had lasted more than 20 years. I was happy to have it because it started me down the road to making my own bread, which I love to do. I generally use the mixer about 20 times a year, almost exclusively for making breads.Well, after 7 years, the motor died. I'd like to replace the mixer I have, but now I'm looking for something a bit more reliable than Kitchen Aid. If I have no other choice, I'd rather not spend $200+ on a mixer which won't last more than 150 uses.I probably just got a lemon, but I'm not inclined to take another chance."
3,Not as sturdy as it looks,Flimsy...and expensive. I wouldn't recomment it. The rest of the Rubbermaid garage org system is great though...
4,just buy it!!,"well this is just what it says essential. these guys make you turn up your car radio and bang your head, even if you got rid of your mullet years ago. it's kind of funny to listen to some of the songs and hear a lot of gay over tones and think about all the heavy metal rockers that freaked out when we found out rob was one of the gays. personally i couldn't care what he likes as long as JP keeps rockin out even if they have to roll onto stage with walkers. just buy the cd already. get ready to rock out with your c*ck out"
4,This is vintage Ray Stevens!,"Like Weird Al, Ray Stevens was in the 60s & 70s the musical commentator on various cultural oddities-- his parody ""Butch Barbarian"" was a hilarious take-off on a popular beer ad campaign. And he achieves several hilarious take-offs on teen angst songs. You just have to be sure you are up-to-date on some of the cultural references. Ray Stevens did for entertainment what Spike Jones and others did before him-- and if that type of humor is your particular cup of tea, this is some of the best. In later years, Ray Stevens achieved even greater comedic heights with The Streak-- but don't EVER forget that this artist has a whole stack of wonderful SERIOUS music, including a gospel album that is the best anywhere. But laugh along with him on the selections contained in this CD. Love ya Ray!"
4,Good product and good price!,"I was confused by the pictures that showed on the product page. So I did some researches to make sure the picture with the little girl is matched the descriptions. My 3-year-old daughter lovers it very much. She pretends teacher and student at home. It would be perfect if this set includes all holidays and special events cards. Because of that, I only gave this product 4 stars."
3,Peach Flavored Lollies From Linda's Lollies,"THE lollie pop had an unplesent taste it was like tasting a surgary bitter peach. It hit me by surprize because i usually like the lollie pops from LInda's lollies like the pinapple and coconut, perfectly sweet!!! Also as advice to Linda make your peach Lollies sweeter, and less bitter!!!!!! THanks for all your hard work at Linda's LOllies!!!!"
5,Jedi Knight from Brazil reviewing the Sith weapon,"I must say that the detail on this saber is amazing. however, there are quite a few problems, being the blades being good, but not excellent in terms of resistance. Other one is that there are two functional buttons, one that toggles on/off and other that only turns the toy off, and both are in the way of the hands, so the saber turns off very often. Mine has broke in the middle of the handle, and I think that it was a plastic problem, but in all, it is a great toy. I am looking forward to buying a new one to replace mine."
5,excellent shoulder rest,after going through numerous types of shoulder rests searching for the perfect design i finally found this company. their claims that it may be the most comfortable shoulder rest design are not totally unfounded... ! highly recommended.
3,Flashlight bulbs,Item received did not match Web site picture as shown. This is a regular Krypton flash light bulb (not SCREW in type as shown) to be used in a regular flash light.
1,Hardcover not what I received,I have not read the book yet since I just got it minutes ago.I merely want other buyers to know I got a softbound/paper copy only and not the hardcover advertised.
1,patience is not passion,"Patience by Lisa Valdez is disappointing and lacking in a true romance between the major characters of Patience and Matthew. Her previous novel, Passion was romantic, suspenseful, entertaining and at the end of story we cheered for Mark and Passion. Not so with Patience. I still don't know why Matthew and Patience are ""in love"". The cringe worthy spanking and crying scenes are inserted without rhyme or reason. Matthew is ""fighting for his life"" after he was revealed as a bastard in Passion, however, that part of the story is never really developed and the resolution at the end of the story was weak and manufactured( I could have done without another senseless ""letter""). Did the author lose her way? The story was disjointed and jarring. Who are Matthew's allies and why? Enemies and why? To her credit the scenes between Patience and Passion were the most well-written in the book, in fact, the author's ""voice"" was most real there.This book was not worth the four year wait."
1,VERY BADLY DONE!!!!!!!,"I am sorry I cannot recommend this book. Patience's constant crying and Matthew constantly spanking her, where very disturbing to me. Their was something very dysfunctional in their relationship. I don't find being spanked and being given commands such as sit and stay very romantic. This has no place in romance novels. Very Badly Done!!!!"
3,I do enjoy Lisa's writing,"Lisa Valdez can write a story. What is lacking in this story compared to ""Passion"" is more of a balance between the sex and romance. I am not at all into this extremely graphic and erotic type of story, but in ""Passion"" the beautiful romance and story captured me. That is what this story needed, more story and romance and less graphic sex. Lisa's writing in this story again captured me and I have enjoyed reading it. I just find myself wanting more of the story and romance that you find in between the sex scenes. I liked both characters better in those parts of the story. I do look forward to ""Primrose"", I just hope there is a better balance and we get more romance and story and less shock factor and detail to the sex. I believe Lisa's writing is strong enough that she could back way off on the sex and tell a great story."
1,Lacking,"After waiting so long for this novel to make an appearance, it was an extreme let down. While sex scenes are hot and contribute to the novel overall, it should not be the main focus of any novel. I feel as if this book was 90% sex and 10% story. Nothing of substance was ever really developed here. But, if you are looking for 50 different ways to perform fellatio - this may be the novel for you."
1,Not even close to Passion......,"I won't give away the contents of the story but I find it ironic that the names of each book speak for themselves. ""Passion"" was not just a clever name. That book was literally filled with such emotion and passion that I have read it at least 7 times. Patience is another story altogether and the name of the book is very fitting. I found myself attempting to have patience as I struggled to read through the boring, loveless, repetitive, emotionless sex scenes. I would say love scenes but there weren't any. You don't feel the love in this book. It's devoid of emotion and extremely cold. I didn't even finish it... and I waited a very, very long time for this book."
3,Patience,"After LOVING Passion, I anxiously awaited Patience. I was disappointed. I found it lacking romance and was put off by the BDSM. Now, I am an open-minded person and believe in ""to each his own"". I also read plenty of erotica and enjoy it. I felt this was bordering on abuse with not enough tenderness to balance things out. I still read the whole book and will read Primrose as well. Just a fair warning to all."
2,I waited all this time for this??????????????,"OMG... I expected so more more in this story. Passion was so much better than Patience. I have longed for this book to be released. It took so long I really thought this story was going to be great. How wrong I was. I loved Matthew (hero) in Passion. In this story he seemed like a totally different person. I just didn't feel the love between Matthew and Patience. The plot was boring. Towards the end I did a lot of skimming. Maybe if there was a little more drama between Matthew and his X (Rosalind), it would have added some excitement. This could have been so much better. If you are a Passion fan, then you can understand the disappointment."
3,NOT BETTER THAN PASSION,"I did like the book but I felt the ending was rushed. The first book, Passion, was great and I expected this book to be just as great if not better considering how long it took for it to come out. However, if the author chose to write a third book about the third sister Primrose I would still read it."
2,not her best,"This is a nice book, but in my opinion, it is not her best collection of artists' works. I have one of her first books and really love it."
5,Would I want to buy these?,"If you want heavy duty, long handled diagonals, which are forged and not cast, then yes, you'd want to buy these.These are long handled and have a solid, heavy feel. They're tightly riveted yet easy opening and closing. The handle is a light duty rubber that will last years if you're not beating on them. If you're the type that beats on your gear, then yes, the rubber looks/feels like it will tear. They're not stainless, so yes, you'll have to keep these puppies dry or, like all unfinished tools, they look like they'll rust. Decent price, decent quality and if you're a ""Prime"" member, two-day shipping is included in the price. Considering the hassle of driving to the hardware store, standing in line and paying for the gas to get there and back, my opinion, this is a good deal."
5,Excellent novel of today's world of finanace and intrigue in a small Swedish town with worldwide reprocussions,"Henning Mankell's inspector Wallender come to grips with the world of finance, internet, and murder in thtis skillfully crafted mystery that keeps the pages turning as he tracks those who for a misguided purpse want to shut down the world's ecnomies, murder most foul, false leads, and suspense keeps the pages turning, a wondeerful read"
2,Gloom and depression,"Slow paced, confused plot even at the end, but most of all too depressing. Inspector Wallander sobs and whimpers from beginning to end on his divorce (caused by his egocentric focus on career), friends who abandon him (one can understand why), colleagues who hide from him... And as an excuse he moans ""o tempora, o mores"", pretending that modern society is at the root of his own squallor."
3,too much re-hash,"I love the Kurt Wallander mystery series. No, serioulsy, I LOVE the books.But this book rehashed everything previous WAY too much. Also, there were just glib references to things that could have been real life changers for our protagonist (e.g., diabetes) that were never fleshed out. Then there's the whole aspect of KW becoming a grumpy old man.... but again, since these are largely procedural novels, showing the process would be good... And then the end didn't wrap things up the way Mankell usually does. I'm hoping the next one is as good as all the previous ones..."
4,Computer Hacker Terrorists Try to Wreak World Havoc But Wallander Stops Them in Time,"As a fan of the Kurt Wallander series, I found this the most current and thought-provoking novel. The twists and turns of the usual Mankell plot, with mysterious dead bodies, a killer Oriental, African location, World Bank corruption and a teenage hacker as a key figure---all these and more will make you stay up way past your bedtime. Trenchant commentary on the vulnerability of our electonics-dependant society woven into the novel heighten one's interest. Will the world's financial institutions be saved ormade impotent by a virus that destroys data? That's what is mean by the ""Firewall"" title in that the malevolent computer wall protects the button designed to destroy these world-wide institutions. A good and enlightening read."
3,***,"I liked this. Quick read, teenage drama that felt real. Well-developed and relateable characters, believable plot. Nice distraction for an evening."
4,"Balanced, Nuanced Overview of the Future","I've read quite a few of the current crop of pop futurology, and this is definitely one of the best. Instead of the empty hype and hot air I've often found elsewhere, this is a surprisingly sensible, well-researched survey of the major themes of 21st century technology: biotech, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, etc. And unlike many other books in the genre, it also takes into account economics, politics, and the unpredictabilty of human nature -- something of a blind spot even for giants such as Arthur C. Clarke. My only criticism is a lack of discussion of how all these various trends might combine (for instance, it would seem obligatory to include a critique of Vinge's singularity theory). Otherwise though, top-notch."
3,Best part of the book are the floor plans,"I am about to buy a cape and thought this book might give me some ideas to consider for renovations in the 5-10 year plan. While somewhat helpful, it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. The book provides before and after floor plans for cape homes which is great. That is the best part of the book for me. Although the book was not published all that long ago, it's old enough that it felt outdated. I'm glad I bought it used and didn't pay any more for it than I did."
5,Cape Cod owner and lover,"My husband and I got this book from the library and we both loved it - so I'm buying it for him for our anniversary this year. We have plans down the road to make this our ""dream home"" and this book has given us lots of dreams and ideas for the present while we wait on the future. He will be so excited!"
2,A Little Disappointed,This album did not have the live instrumentation feel that I was looking for. I only cared for two tracks on the whole CD. I would suggest getting an iTunes account and purchasing track number one (Star/Pointro) and seven (Boom!). Definately listen before you buy!!!
5,Yeah!!!!! the tipping point!,"Now this is an album. But why does it have to be so short. This is a big step from ""Phrenology."" Not that the album was bad, but i dont think alot of folks were feeling the album and its concept and direction (along with ""Electric circus"" by Common)That just goes to show that those albums will be later appreciated to come. But ""Tipping point"" gets instant clasic status in my opinion, with ""Star"" being one of the best songs ever, or at least the top 5. Get it!!!!!!!PS always a fan...keep up the good work!"
4,not the best but off the hook,this album isnt the best roots has to offer but even their worst is better than 90 percent of other people's best. basically if u like the roots at all you will like this so cop it.
4,Good for everyone,I had this book for a art class that I took. I am not at all art savvy and this book showed me a lot of things. I would recommend it.
3,predictable and drawn out,Mercedes Lackey is a good story teller but after reading the last of the herald mage series and the queens own this story was very predictable. Disaster! Miraculous solution! World saved. It shouldnt have been a 3 book series
2,Far as I can tell,"This particular edition, though planned, doesnt seem to have ever actually gotten published. I could be wrong, and an incorrect listing might be a first on Amazon, but can't find it nowhere else by title or isbn. Has anyone out there actually seen it? Thanks."
4,Very nice anthology,"I read a lot of science fiction anthologies, and found this to be one of the more enjoyable ones that I've read recently. I had read the first two books in this series (Hitting the Skids in PixelTown and Empire of Dreams and Miracles) and had enjoyed both of those. I actually liked this better than Empire of Dreams, which was itself a good book. This series is based on contest submissions, and tends to get a broader variety of stories and ideas than some of the other anthologies I've read. Are they fantastic stories? No. Were they a good fun read? Yes. (Review written by Joshua, Erica's husband, who is too lazy to have his own Amazon account.)"
1,not needed... flash light came with spare,I'm sure that I will have lost these before I go through two light bulbs that came with the flash light.it is nice to have a c-cell flashlight... these batteries are usually still available during storms/power outages when D's and AA's are cleaned out of the stores
3,not really a good mystery,this book was ok but i deffintly think that its not one of carolyn keenes best books. it deffintly not myfavorite book. there really is no mystery to keep you thinking. i personnly didnt care for it.....
3,Hidden references for Magicians!,"I love ""con"" films (The Sting, The Spanish Prisoner, Heist, etc.) and enjoyed this one although it does not come close to the others I just mentioned. Part of the reason I love this genre is that I am a close-up/card magician and magicians use many ""con"" tecniques in their craft...albiet for entertainment pursposes only.I was delighted at the story line that took place at the club I belong to (The Academy of Magical Arts, aka ""The Magic Castle,"" in Hollywood). Not only that but many of the characters are named for famous magicians (and I am NOT talking about Copperfield or Blaine here). Some of those names are ""Larry Jennings,"" ""Charlie Miller,"" and ""Dai Vernon"" - the latter also has a seperate look-a-like character played by Hal Holbrook, known as ""The Professor"" (the real Dai Vernon's nickname).An enjoyable enough dvd to pass as hour and a half with!"
4,This movie is tight.,"Great cast, excellent plot, and just enough twists to keep you guessing. Props to R. Paul Wilson for teaching the non-magicians proper slight of hand."
2,A triumph of style over substance,This flick is a good example of a good cast wasted by a lot of gratuitous digital FX that simply distract from the story. A typical case of producers thinking they can make more jack with a lot of hi tech razzle dazzle to appeal to the brainless gamer demographic. Add this to the growing list of films that could've been hits but tanked because the producers didn't understand that gimmicks are no substitute for a good story.Glitz can't save a lousy movie but it can sure wreck a good one.
1,Astounding ignorance of poker,"As a poker player, I really wanted to see this film, and I really wanted to like it. The writer and the director of this film are totally clueless about the game of poker. The film is unwatchable. The poker sequences are laughably bad. I could not watch the whole thing, I just turned it off about half way through. For the poker, I give it zero stars on a scale of 1 to 5. As a movie above and beyond the technical aspects, about 2 or 3 stars because of muddled plot development and so-so characters."
3,I liked everything but the ending !,"The whole concept of this book I found to be fascinating. Walk or you die. I wanted more. I wanted more of a conclusion. I am sure I missed some deeper meaning King was trying to get across but having the ""winner"" end it the way they did just left me with a want. I stayed up late to finish this book and this is what I got??!!! I was not happy !"
3,Not Bad !,"I just finished reading the long walk a few days ago and i have to say that i was fasinated with the concept of the book. The idea is very original and entertaining. However the ending was disappointing. The author never tells us what happens after Ray Garraty ""seems"" to have won the long walk."
2,So so read,"Not the norm for a Stephen King novel. 100 kids start walking, and if you stop, you get shot. Ho hum."
3,"Well, that was interesting","This is the first Stephen King book I have read in a long time. A friend recommend this to me because I liked The Hunger Games. If you are a reader that needs everything explained to you in the story this is not the book for you. This story left a lot of questions for me and I like closure when I read a book. Maybe Mr King is not really my kind of author. With that being said, I did like the story so I gave it three stars."
1,THIS IS NOT STEPHAN KING!,"I CANNOT BELIEVE HE WROTE THIS BORING NO PLOT NO ENDING BOOK. I'VE LOVED ALL HIS BOOKS FOR YEARS AND I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE HE WOULD DISAPPOINT ME ! IT TOOK ME TWO MONTHS TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO BORING KIDS GETTING SHOT ON A WALK? WHERE'S THE STORY????? I HOPE BAG OF BONES IS BETTER, I'M READING THAT NEXT."
5,The Journey,"The problem that so many people have with this book is that they place too much importance on who wins the competition. This book, however, is not a tale about the beginnings and ends. It is a story about the actual journey of life. After all that is what life truly is about.The fact that it is a story about the journies of a 100 kids, who all, to some small degree, know that they are going to die, makes this book so good."
3,Why is the price so high?,What I want to know is why is the kindle version $7.99 when he wrote this as richard bachman-the paperback is what 3.80? Doesn't make any sense
4,"The ending stinks, but the book is good until then.","The characters had depth. As you read it feels like you really come to know them. However, the ending is anticlimactic."
3,Liked the book not the ending,"I've been reading some of King's not so scary books lately....I did look forward to reading this book every night before I went to sleep. King didn't really tell us why these boys were walking or why they wanted to in the first place! He brought the characters to life tho so you could know each individual's personality. The ending was NOT tied up and I was left questioning did he or didn't he survive?Or win? Overall, it was a good read."
5,Another Great Book by Stephen King,A great read as always with Stephen King. My favorite author. Love his style of writing. Loved the story and the price was affordable.
2,The Long Walk,"This was one of the saddest books that I have read in a long time. Young boys are selected to walk, and walk and walk. They cannot stop for anything. I did not enjoy this book at all."
5,Amazing book,A book like this should be on every kindle! I couldn't take my eyes off the pages. Definatly 5 stars.
4,The long walk by Stephen king,Fast paced.... Good read....Stephen king does it again...makes you feel as though you were walking right along with them the whole way.
3,"New Book, minor secondary publisher","I wanted a hardback copy of ""The Glass Bead Game"" I hoped it would be from the main publisher. It was like a bookclub edition which was kind of cheezy. New, in good shape, yes. A library shelf addition, not much better than a paperback."
5,The best Hesse's book,"First time I read it when I was 15, and I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. One has to be prepared to read this book and to be able to accept all: strange combination of math, music, language, different ideas, search for harmony. I reread this book every 2-3 years."
4,"Scherchen's adventurous ""Resurrection""","Hermann Scherchen has a fluctuating reputation among Mahlerites. Some think very highly of SOME of his interpretations (e.g., the Vienna or Toronto no. 7, and the Vienna or Leipzig no. 3), but others consider them to be too adventurous and deviant when compared with Mahler's score.This recording, however, provides one of Scherchen's best Mahler interpretations caught on a disc: the studio 1959 Vienna take of symphony no. 2. It is as adventurous as one could expect from Scherchen, but this works well with the ""sense of drama"" that this symphony requires in order to be really successful.Recording quality is acceptable as an early stereo take, but strings are quite weak (too few).This interpretation exist in many incarnations, most of them hard to find since they are deleted from the catalogue."
4,Enjoyable album,"It's hard to find a good Mel Tillis compilation CD, especially when you consider the size of musical library. One of the greatest songwriters ever, with none other than Ray Price and Webb Pierce delivering his material. This 11 track Cd could have provided some of Mel's more popular (and recognizable) songs (ie Coca Cola Cowboy); but at the same time, this Cd provides ""Woman in the Back of My Mind"" and ""Stomp them Grapes"". So, there's a little bit of everything here. This Polygram release provides no liner notes or artist info, but for the affordable price, a complaint is not warranted."
5,One Awesome printer!!!,"I've owned a few top of the line ink jets but this Kodak sub-dye printer is just plain awesome. If you need professional photos, this is the printer to get. It's fast, quiet and produces a print that is smooth with a lot of color and contrast. Shadow detail is breath taking and it is also easy to use."
4,Swingers,"Swingers takes us an erotic journey turned into destruction. Rena and Greg embark on a path of swinging. They both take the path for their own reasons. The scenes are developed nicely and you are able to get a visual with each scene. The sex scenes are sexy and steamy, making you want to jump in the book. Two Thumbs Up!"
3,A mess...,This novel was a crazy mess! A secret desire...lies/cheating....deceit had an domino effect and lives were changed 2 the point of loosing everything.
1,WOMENS!!!,"Bought these for employees to use in the freezer/coolers. The gloves fit my 5'8"" and under women. They are not big enough for my woman's size 8 hand, or for my men, who just laughed when they saw them/tried them on.Made in China."
1,Piece of Cra* software. Reveled itself all of the time.,"I installed this on two PCs on a network. One 2000 and one XP. MS messenger would bring up the panel. This was installed in stealth mode. The XP machine also revealed itself. I came home from an errand and my girlfriend asked "" what in the he** do you think you are doing monitoring my stuff, trying to get my passwords?"" Well it did not even log those and the logs are real hard to read. Uninstalled after one day. Also got me in real hot water. Guess it was my own fault for lack of trust."
1,"No customer support, unreliable.","I tried a demo version of this software, hoping to buy it from Amazon after evaluating it. One of the features in it is to be able to hide folders/drives on your pc. I tried it and it deleted permanently the entire folder and I lost my data. Their customer service has not been answering my requests regarding this matter. I am now looking for a reliable data recovery software, but it has cost me a lot of time, energy as well as given a lot of frustration. I hope Amazon notes this and cautions its customers before purchase, otherwise the so-loyal Amazon customers will feel cheated."
5,24 inch slip,"I've purchased Vanity Fair slips for decades and find them to be of good quality. This particular slip has a rolled hem. I am happy that I found the size, length, and color I need."
4,Broke my 3-year hiatus from caffeine....,"....when a friend offered me a cup of Nespresso from her machine. I immediately went online and bought myself one despite doctor's advice. It has excellent flavour and aroma - and the different blends offer a good variety for different moods and tastes. It is easy to operate, and the capsules are convenient to purchase. My only gripe is: I still cannot get it to froth properly for a good cappuccino - but I highly recommend this for coffee enthusiasts."
3,beanie,"This is the ugliest, most mis-shaped hat EVER! It's advantage is it fits my husband's huge head with room to spare. Unfortunately, he looks stupid wearing it. He loves it though because it is warm."
5,Great Product,"This is first class storage option for all my hard drives. The foam inside, that can be tailored to fit almost any equipment is an excellent system. Dust proof, water proof and robust enough to take on long transit flights with no damage. In fact it worked so well I have now bought other cases for all my computer equipment, first class."
5,You cannot have everything,"as others reviewers have said, the shade is a bit bulky but because of this it covers every square inch of the windshield and this is what finally matters.I leave my car parked for long periods in the open and thogh I could eventually withstand the heat inside the car, the main point is the damaging effect of UV rays on the dashboard so I am perfectly happy with this product.One final point: the BMW lettering on the shade is a nice touch. After all, what is the point of having a beemer if you won't brag about it? :-)"
4,"One of the best sci fi serials, whatever the name on it","Actuallly, I've already reviewed this under it's original title, THE UNDERSEA KINGDOM. This is one of the greatest with ""Crash"" Corrigan as the hero, Lon Chaney Jr. as a secondary villain, and Lee Van Atta. I would've given it five stars if the cheating in the most spectacular chapter ending in the serial weren't so flagrant."
5,Laura Lives On In Her Music !!!,"Rest in Peace, Laura Branigan.....May God bless you.......You will be greatly missed !!!......We love you............"
2,"If you want to have a single ""Greatest hits"" of Laura Branigan, this one should not be the one to have","If you want a ""Greatest hits"" compilation of Laura Branigan, you should look somewhere else. This compilation lacks ""All Night With Me"","" Satisfaction"", ""Shattered Glass"", ""Moonlight on Water"", ""I Found Someone"", ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"", ""Never in a million years"", ""Shadow of Love"", and several more.This compilation opted to add new tracks(""Show Me Heaven"", ""Dim all The Lights""), which should not be qualified as her Best/Great hits, the compilation should have opted to add more hits from her career instead of something new and untested as ""Best/Greatest"" hits. May be the new songs could have been added as Bonus tacks at the end of the CD, but they were scattered in the middle of the other hits songs.If you want to have a ""Greatest hits"" compilation, I recommend ""Laura Branigan Platinum Collection"" or ""Very Best of Laura Branigan""."
4,Very enjoyable...and it went with us to a cave,"We used this in our study of, can you believe it, caves. I know, we're weird.Anyways, this book was great. It presented the material clearly and had nice illustrations to help them further understand. After reading it they spent hours drawing pictures of all sorts of caves and caverns.You could easily spend several days/weeks going through the information here and expanding it with further books, activities and pictures. As with all of Gail Gibbons books I try to find actual photos of the things she illustrates. We even took this with us to explore some caves and the boys were able to identify things based on what they learned from this book.*taken from my review at goodreads"
3,A helpful guide,"This guide to budgies was published in 1997. Its author is Julie Rach. It totals 126 pages. There are ten chapters. Numerous color photos are contained--they are helpful. Also, informative sidebars are included. Examples of topics covered are the budgie's ancestry, budgie selection, care, cage selection, toys for the budgie, feeding, grooming, health, feathers, senses, teaching the budgie how to talk, and taming the budgie. No information on breeding is provided. A page is set aside to demonstrate--with a color illustration and lines pointing to the corresponding anatomical parts--the external features of the budgie, which is useful. This guide to budgies is recommendable."
4,"Precise,Informative Book","I found the information in this book to be informative and to the point. Though it is directed mainly towards black women,I think we all can gain some insight from Ms. Bakari's words. It also deals with relationships,dealing with past hurts, and moving beyond the pain."
3,resist violence,"Profits go to the Home Alive project. Musically this is a collection of tracks by a diverse collection of punk/grunge artists.Pearl Jam collectors need this for their cover of ""Leaving Here"".Some tracks are spoken word pieces.Also of interest are Nirvana's ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifter(live)"" and Soundgarden's ""Kyle Petty (Son Of Richard)""."
1,"Great design, but poor quality control","I loved the cord storage of this compact travel charger for my Nokia phone, but this charger stopped working in less than three months. My two original Nokia chargers also failed in less than a year. Meanwhile, all of the other (non-Nokia) chargers that I've bought in the last five years are still working fine! The two Nokia 6015i phones I've owned (the first one died) also have had more quality control problems than I've ever had before with a cellular phone, so I'm avoiding Nokia products now."
2,"Dissapointing, because it wasn't my first.","Given, this is a old cd before JR had fully blossomed, and it shows. The tracks seem empty and on continuous loops. JR is one of my favorite groups, so if you cast your disession basing it on this album only, pick up Shangho, or B.O.D. You will quickly see what this beggining spawned, and why it is still worth the time to listen too."
1,also disappointed,"I, too, found the quality of this video to be very poor. I would also caution any French teachers planning to purchase this video; a few scenes may be somewhat inappropriate for school children (however, French). There are much better videos with which to teach culture."
5,Today's Tactical Primer for the Heavy Metal Army,"If you are riding in a combat vehicle that weighs over 11 tons, and you have to read this book. It takes basic tenants from Duffer's drift and puts it into a mechanized framework. Read Duffer's drift first, then this book. It will change the way you look at terrain or I'll eat a box of MREs!"
4,Worth every penny.,Gets the junk I can't stand off the floor of the garage and is easy for the kids to use. It's great. Not 5 stars becuase the whole system can nickel and dime you into lots of $$$$. But plan ahead and you won't spend excessively.
1,Another B Movie,Definitely a High School film project with all the predictable cliche lines and plot. Nice if you like the junk you used to watch on the Late late late show as a teen.
4,nothing short in these eyes,I remember seeing this as a teenager and thinking to myself this is not Willard.Although Bruce Davidson is as creepy in Short Eyes as he was in Willard these are two different animals.This movie paved it's way toward more harsher prison films later on this one marks Lois Guzman's screen debut and at first I missed him.Yepper he's that quick in the scene.Although Short Eyes isn't awardwinning by any standards It still gets under my skin only because of the news and widespread topics centering on Pedophiles.It's nice to see these movies resurface again to take my mind off of the junk that's out there. Not to mention any names....CHILD'S PLAY 3 OOOOPS SORRY!!!!
1,I have not received Short Eyes,"I received a notice of some sort, but I have not received the DVD of Short Eyes. It's hard to rate it at this point."
2,Not as advertised,This is advertised as a double set. I received disc two only. I am disappointed and still looking for the double set.
4,Great manual without much competition...,"Great manual but there are not that many options to choose from in this field if you want a book small enough to carry in your lab coat. In every way this book is top notch and has practical application for daily practice. It includes plenty of ""cut to the chase"" advice on how to manage these medicines. My only complaint is that the book is from 1997 and plenty has changed since then in the field."
4,lockable gas cap,"After I noticed the lid for the gas fill line was open, I decided to purchase this lockable gas cap. It was delivered as advertised and fit perfectly. I took a short trip where I needed to fill up a few times. There was no issue in using this cap after I remembered to take the key with me from the driver's side."
5,Phenomenal CD!,"This album is the most honest, pure, and heart-felt new age piano album on the market. It's Spring and I'm still listening to this ""Chritmas"" album - or is it? Overall, it's beautiful. Cardall's orginal style is divine. His arrangements are totally innovative."
1,I Am Very Disappointed,"I know the rating seems harsh, but it's how I feel. I am very dissapointed in this soundtrack, probably because I thought it would be the musical score from the TV show. Instead, all it is is kiddyish rap/rock & roll that we've never even heard in the TV show!!! It WILL, however, be in a new segment on the new episodes called ""Pikachu's Jukebox"" (NOT MORE PIKACHU!). Bottom line, IT SUCKS!!! I think it is a waste of money and I will not be buying it (except maybe for the PokéRap video, but that is all)."
3,this c-d is o.k.!,"this c-d was dam good i loved it botem line it was so cool my favorite songs were mistys song and 2beamaster songand whatkind of pokemon are you i really liked the music video they showed on kids WB on the whatkindof pokemon are you, but mostly my favorite was mistys song cause i like her stlye but now i knowandwe alll know how she feels about ash maybe now we can blackmail her heheheheheheheheheheeheh"
4,Wrist blood pressure cuff,This product does its job for finding an average pulse and blood pressure so I know if I need to take my medicine or not. But from what I have heard since I work in a hospital it is not as reliable as a normal blood pressure cuff.
1,defective product,"I purchased this item about 4 days ago, and even though I have high standard, arm blood pressure monitor, I wanted something compact and small. From the first reading, this monitor was erroneous in its numbers. VERY HIGH 160/101I measured my blood pressure again , numerous times,compared it with the high quality arm monitor, and it read 135/82.This kind of reading can be alarming to someone who does not compare the faulty reading to another instrument. I AM RETURNING THIS PRODUCT ASAP> do not buy this item,"
5,Accurate and Convenient,I happened to get my BP checked at the Doctor's office the day my monitor arrived. It is pretty accurate and very easy to use. I'm so glad I bought it. My husband loves it as well because it is so easy to use.
5,Great size,"It's nice to have a purse-size edition of the BB with only the first 164 pages, the *real* BB. Thanks for having it so reasonably priced."
1,"I'm sorry, these are cliche","I don't care if he's a world famous photographer with a starry portfolio - these photographs are not inspiring nor inspired. They are ok, but nothing particularly touching, nothing that strikes a chord with a real person. The models have cliche looks and somewhat exaggerated and strained bodies. And say what you might about the beauty of the female form and black and white film, but his lens is more objectifying and, well, pornographic, than artistic on the female bodies. He is best suited for photographing celebrities for MAXIM."
2,Quite Different,"After reading the first 2 books, I had high expectations for the 3rd book. When I began to read it, I did not feel hooked onto the book at all. For the first two books, Georgia Byng always kelt you on the edge of your seat. You would think that you knew what was going to happen-- and then, BAM!-somthing else would happen that was unexpected.But, in the third book, I found that the book did not have this charasitic of the reader being pulled into the book. If you have read past Molly Moon books, then you might not like this book at much as the others."
2,"A good book, but the worst ending I have ever read.","I'm a big fan of Dennis Wheatley; the atmosphere in his books are superb, and his characterisation is masterful. Unfortunately, although he sometimes creates amazing plots, many of his books end with an unsatisfying ""deus ex machina"". This is one of those books. The ending is not only illogical, but impossible, as far as I can tell. Not to mention the other thing that happens, which I can't tell you without spoiling the book.The rest of the book is fairly exciting and scary. Toby Jugg (""ahaha"") is confined to a wheelchair. He is staying in a remote mansion in Wales (DW seems to be very anti-Welsh, by the way) and gets imprisoned. Then he gets visited by demons, falls in love, etc etc.Not Dennis Wheatley's best book."
1,"Great concept, poor quality.","Just like another reviewer here, I found these template guides to be surprisingly poorly made. And it's too bad because I love the quick-change design. The problem was that the cylinder in the very first guide I used snapped off during use the very first time I used it. Fortunately it didn't just fly off the router or it could have cause me to ruin my workpiece or worse. But now the guide is useless, after less than one use. I'm hesitant to try any of the other sizes now for fear of the same thing happening. It's just not worth it.Another reviewer suggested using the Bosch adapter for PC template guides. I think it's sound advice and that's my plan. I've had a great experience with other Bosch tools (the only exception being the susceptibility of the power switch in the 1617 EVS router to wood dust), so this shoddy product caught me by surprise."
4,Bosch Router Template Guide Set,"I bought the Bosch router template guide set to use with a Bosch Router and a Porter Cable dovetail jig. While the Bosch guides are a unique design, there is an adapter included with the set to allow the use of the more standard screw-on type guides. I previously read a review indicating that the Bosch guides don't work well with the Porter Cable jig, so I use the Porter Cable guides delivered with the jig along with the Bosch adapter. This arrangement works very well. I have not yet tried the Bosch guides for other applications."
5,Just as described.. better value than many out there,Simple love this design and it is unlike other bumpers which look diff in photo and have only 1 knitted design on 1 side.Recommended for portable cribs.
1,Mr. Gasket chrome alternator bracket 5171,"This item looks great but absolutely does not fit. I wasted my money. The hole for the thermo. housingbolt does not line up. I tried to drill the hole bigger but it still was not in line. After a frustratingand back-breaking hour, I gave up. It's not like I can return it now! I wish the designers would have made thepart like o. e. m.. Don't waste your money like I did. I have a 69 chevelle. 350/350. I tried to add blingbut the thing doesn't fit!!!!!"
2,ok Speakers,"Speakers sound ok, but had issues with the power switch not working. Archos was no help in fact they did not even know anything about the speakers (Scary). The power supply stopped working after about 6 months."
2,"Great idea gone very, very wrong.","What child (or adult, for that matter) wouldn't love to have all this stuff to work on? Well, it's a great idea, but the materials provided are unnecessarily shoddy and limiting.Another reviewer had a similar experience. Has the price of paper gone up so high that they can't afford to use decent paper to print out the pictures to color? And, why so FEW crayons? Customers would rather pay a little more and get something that is USABLE.Big box, questionable quality of contents but LOTS of frustration for the recipient! MEGA FRUSTRATION for the gift-giver, as I was hoping to enjoy showing the fun of creativity."
3,A pretty average sequel.,"As a big fan of Rosenberg's I have to say that this one is unneccessary and just a rehash of the great MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES.A virtual blow by blow of critical scenes from MC are listed here. Some of the dialogue is so brutally verbatim from Propositions and other rote siscussions on criminal law it is boring.That said the rest of the narrative is quite good and moves a pretty good pace. Nancy's strengths are in building suspense and then letting the action take you on a ride.Unfortunately, Rosenberg should dig up new and original plots and not just regurgitate past glories."
4,Tasty but...,This is a very pleasant tea... smooth taste. I didn't see any mood-relaxing benefits to it other than what all hot teas do... but it is delicious!
4,Lemon Balm Tea,"This would be my second favorite method. While the tincture is my favorite and the pills my least, I think this is a good method as it provides the lemon balm relaxation and the nice warmth of tea. Definitely needs sweetener."
3,"Entertaining, but...","The book was enjoyable. Made for some light reading during lunch hours at the office. But it wasn't up to the standards that I expect from a collection like this. Perhaps someone with more of a musical background might enjoy it more than I did. A couple of the stories were very engrossing and entertaining, but overall it wasn't the best I have read."
2,"Spode is great, but just not this set","The spode 3 piece tea set is made in China, not England and definitely feels and appears to be a cheaper, more mass-produced item than what I am used to buying from Spode. Although the price is cheaper than most Spode products, the quality is worse and would not recommend this set."
2,Much anticipated....but ultimately disappointing.,"Having heard the McCreesh ensemble of Victoria's Requiem which is taut, controlled and achingly beautiful, I had high expections of this recording. I guess I was expecting a more subdued, almost ""Palestrina-esque"" elegant performance. McCreesh's performance of this piece is bordering on sounding like an comic opera! As previous reviewers have noted there are some really peculiar tempos, dynamics which are constantly in flux within individual choruses and solos. The diction and pronunciation of the mezzo is truly strange.The package design in a clear cased double jewel box subliminally suggest an almost icy cool sober recording. The packaging I must admit is simply beautiful, but don't be seduced by it.I have heard many recordings and would recommend the excellent John Eliot Gardiner on Phillips. Gardiner also uses a mixed choir (both men and women chorus).If an all boys choir is desired I suggest getting the Hogwood version on L'Oiseaux Lyre."
3,Oh my goodness!,"It's so campy! It's so catchy! It's so...well it's Christmas music, so what do you want? I dont see Anthony Daniels topping any charts, but if you want that warm, fuzzy, home for the holidays feeling buy this CD. R2 & 3PO are at their musical best here and even Chewbacca and R5-D4 come along for the sleigh ride through the stars. Merry Christmas and remember, the Force will be...yada yada yada."
3,Depends on who you are...,"If you're the sort of person who gets told ""Lighten Up!"" a lot, we'd probably all be better off if you skip this one.On the other hand, this is a marvelous album for scaring people who desperately need to lighten up."
5,good stuff,Great product but don't overdo it. You don't need to add much when making hypertufas (or they look hairy!)
5,Ecellent book!,"Easy to read, easy to follow and very accurate account of Prophet Mohammed's (PBUH) life. Highly recommended!!!"
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This is indeed an amazing, very much detailed book of the life of prophet peace be upon him. I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Pay attention to this book...,"This book explains how relaxation works... it takes patients to read because it was written by a 20th century scientist... but, it works... I taught relaxation using these techniques and students raved about the results... one student was so ""zoned out"" he was gone to his happy place for over an hour... Once trained you can relax at will... go from stressed to relaxed with a cue... well worth the $2... in fact, it's a gift...You Must Relax"
2,You get what you pay for,"For the price, this is not a bad knife, as it feels good in the hand, is a nice weight, and chops well. However, it is not as durable as I would expect from Kitchen-Aid. The knife will rust if it is left in water for more than an hour or so, and after a month of use, the edge of the blade was showing knicks in it. I e-mailed Kitchen-Aid to complain and was never contacted by them."
4,An oldie but a goodie,Oklahoma is a must if you like the good old Broadway sound. I think it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best works. This recording is also held up by the classic Broadway voice of Afred Drake. The songs are all classics but they move slow and after a little while they all just start sounding the same. The main drawback to this recording is the recording its self. Since it was made in 1943 the techonology was lacking so it sounds like you are listening to an old record. Still it is a must for all broadway fans.
5,Sacred to the American Musical Theatre,"After reading the history of Oklahoma!, and learning of the immense struggles it took for the Theatre Guild, along with Rodgers and Hammerstein, to bring that show to the stage, I am thrilled to know that we are able to honor those extraordinary efforts some 65 years later! No, this is not a quality recording, but it is historic is so many ways and worthy of a listen."
4,Mostly Narration but pleasant nonetheless.,"This is a likeable film, as with a lot of Christian films, the acting is not stellar. But this one actually was bearable. The first half of the film is mostly the main character narrating. Which at first is a little tiresome. However, once the plot really gets going the movie is quite enthralling. It focuses on some Christians in China and how the American girl unwittingly reveals crucial information about them to the Chinese Secret Police. Through a series of circumstances, she's able to convince her father to take some potentially damaging to the Chinese government pictures and so they are able to use the pictures as a bargaining chip. The movie leaves one feeling refreshed and convicted to help one's fellow Christian."
3,All Eve's Hallows: A City Knights Novel,"Good premise. I hope to read the next soon, but will probably wait until it is on e-book or heavily discounted. Read like a comic and was a disappointment for the price. Liked and disliked the short cuts taken for explaining magic and the use/learning of magic. This usually slows the story, but when you totally skip it, you leave something out of the whole verisimilitude of the world that is created."
3,Great description of Bushido but need more strong definition,"It's a great work originally published in 1905. Mr. Nitobe describes the features of Bushido excellently, but his work would be much greater if he defined Bushido explicitly (for example, he could make a chapter titled like ""What is Bushido?""). Nevertheless, this book is of high value as a gateway to understanding Bushido spirit."
4,Classic!,"This classic movie is the best of Jack Nicholson (well, this movie and The Shining). I wish they had better followed the book, but its good nontheless."
5,bought as a replacement,I bought this as a replacement for my food processor. I'm so thankful that it was available! I thought I would have to get a whole new processor. It's exactly the same quality and type as my previous blade. Shipping was fast!
4,"Informative read, more emotional differences rather than physical","Not what I expected, this book helps parents understand how boys are emotionally different than girls and ways that parents can help develop compassion and integrity in their sons, despite what the outside world tells boys they need to do to become men. Would recommend reading for parents of boys of all ages."
2,an overblown main character,"The plot of the story is quite interesting, there are many nice descriptions about houses and some of the people. But since I gave only two stars, there must be some criticism: the description of the various characters is extreamly different, Strickland seems to be of an unreal cruelty, much too strong expression of only one part of his character while the rest is left untold. Instead the characters of some other characters (e.g. the women ) aren't reported sufficently, only superficially. And then, another thing I was missing, is Maugham's lack of knowledge of real culture, or at least the lack of the influence from the Tahitian customs and live style (which is quite different from the English) on Strickland's life. The novel concentrates too much on Strickland's problems and thoughts till it's almost unbearable."
1,Bad Quality,Fair delivery but poor quality. I choose the 'used-very good' but got a 'used-unacceptable'. I can tell that this book must be very very old version. The cover is different from the one I saw online and it's a half-naked female. The back cover and other pages are almost leaving the spine. I love the article and appreciate the opportunity to buy a used book. But the lie about the quality is not acceptable. The only reason I would not to return it is the cost. Other buyer's should be aware of the 'real' quality.
4,Poignant,"I enjoyed reading the book a lot, first started I was always excited to read on to know what would happen next. It is quite hard to believe, that someone could care so little about other people's opinions and feelings as Strickland does, still it gives you another point of view, it shows you the way of someone who followed his obsession entirely and was faithful up to the end at least to himself. Strickland is not the only interesting character in the book though. Strickland's wife, the narrator's friend Stroeve , as well as Blanche, are very special and radical in their way, all of them leave you with a sad picture."
5,Excellent Resource,"I ordered this book in order to use it for language research on a book that I am editing. It is an absolutely excellent resource for anyone who needs to understand the Scot's dialect. It is as it says, a dictionary, and one that give thorough, concise definitions of words."
3,Snuggly,"These are so comfy to sleep in, but I did have to resew them as they are super large, which I hadn't counted on. No problem, have a sewing machine, so shortened and narrowed them to size I needed. They are sturdy and useful both summer and winter and are pretty enough to not need a bedspread."
5,Offramp 2010 Vinyl Review,"If you're looking at this item, then you likely already know the music. You're just wondering if it is worth buying this new 180 gram version, right?ECM Records always made high quality pressings back in the day. This new version is no exception. I do not have a copy of the original version to compare with, but I think you will be happy with this copy. As stated, it is on 180g vinyl, very clean, no noise. The packaging appears to be the same as the original; i.e. no new liner notes, bonus tracks, etc. Perhaps the sleeve is made from heavier stock(?).So have no hesitations about buying this version. I'm very happy with mine. I think this is probably Pat Methney Group's best recording. The music floats on a cloud of reverb, but that is part of its appeal.My advice? Go for it!"
1,I couldn't finish it,"This book was so relentlessly repetitive in stating the subject of discussion that I had to skip to the final chapter to search for conclusions. I usually finish a book or movie but this stands out as a real bomb. Great topic, I wish I could get my $ back."
3,"Not great, not terrible","This book is not very insightful. While giving several examples of teen behavior, it is a basic book of what teens do. I wouldn't be able to fully recommend it - unless you are a new teacher that never took a developmental or abnormal psych course. It's ok, but I wouldn't bother unless you need a book for the plane ride to Grandma's house."
2,Black brow sculpting gel,"I love the product, but it must have been getting old, as it was flakey. Should have sent it back, but didn't."
1,What was the point?,"This book was one sorry read. I regret having spent time on it. It wasn't funny, and it sure didn't grab my attention. I was very disappointed. I honestly don't understand what the point of it was supposed to be. It was poorly written. Pass on this one."
2,Very disappointing.,"This book was really disappointing. It had such a great premise -- a stay-at-home mom is forced to return to her previous profession as a celebrity publicist when her husband loses his job, and she has to deal with the challenges of work re-entry, becoming the sole breadwinner, and babysitting a grumpy has-been.But the story soon peters out. None of the various storylines ever is fully fleshed out. The relationship with her husband -- who is doing a better job of being a stay-at-home mom than she ever did -- suffers little in the way of stress. The guilt she feels as a working mom is glossed over. And the testy has-been actress never gets the dressing-down she so richly deserves.All in all, this was a well-written, though lukewarm, book. I never felt empathy for Julia, instead I wanted to give her a swift kick for being such a doormat."
5,Boston Pops Christmas,"I grew up with the Boston Pops for Christmas! I love them, no matter what they play. This one is the greatest"
4,Good music,Very good album of Christmas music but not as good as Leroy Anderson's Christmas music arrangements which I also reviewed. It is worth the $$ for sure.
2,Songs worked better in the movie,"I enjoyed the movie ""Queen Of The Damned"" and thought the songs worked better in the movie. Listening to this CD on it's own didn't do it for me. Actually it gave me a headache. Kinda grungy and poorly produced. Reminds me of those garage band indie CD's they sell to mall goths at Hot Topic. I have to agree Lucan Wolf the Disco rock vampire dude probably would have been more entertaining on this soundtrack. At least it would have been funny."
1,putrid,have you seen skinny white suburban losers dressed all in black trying to upset their single mothersthey say this putrid pap is the best soundtrack everbetter than saturday night fever - better than repo manthere is only one good track (sung by marilyn manson)most of the songs only have a couple notes in them
2,not very good,This soundtrack could have been so much better if Jonathan Davis was allowed to sing his songs.The only person that did was worth listening to on hear is Marilyn Manson.The rest is just done by your usual radio friendly mtv rock.
4,AMBIENT classic style guitar instrumentals.,"If you like the FELT instrumentals from the early days like from the albums ""Crumbing The Antiseptic Beauty"", ""Ignite The Seven Cannons"", ""Strange Idols.."" and ""The Spendor Of Fear"".. this is for you.. all mellow and very pretty compositions. Deebank is a master guitar player! Sunday afternoon tea time in the garden music!"
2,Died after 8 months,this keypad died after 8 months of use. I wasn't that happy with it anyway. The keypad is flatter than my previous one. I like the pad to be raised up at an angle. Not that intuitive to touch. Overpriced for what it is. Am ordering a Targus model as a replacement which is only $19.
3,The Season Las Vegas went downhill,"I watch Las Vegas religously every week. However, Season 3 is the season that Las Vegas went downill with bad casting of a new hotel manager. Although the season is still decent, it's nowhere near as great as the first two seasons were with the great story writing. I call Season 3 the season that the writers target women with no brains."
4,This Season was a little .... weird.,"Cast was excellent, though minus one. It was a bit abrupt, and you can feel the loss in the dynamic of the crew a little bit. The entertainment is still there, and the cast does roll on. You'll have fun with the season, once it gets moving."
5,The Very Best of Keith Whitley,This is pure and honest country soul music as only Keith Whitley could express it.
5,Entertaining ride down the Mississippi,"If you can't go down the Mississippi yourself, tag along with Knudsen! Meet the ""river rats,"" see the sights, and even smell life on the river as Knudsen found it in 1993. I found this book to be entertaining AND educational. I hope Knudsen has other trips planned so I can journey along with him again."
2,$93.00 fraudulent charge,this was a less than $5.00 purchase and someone either at Amazon or book vendor added a unauthorized $93.00 purchase to my credit card....I e-mailed Amazon to look into this and so far no one has bothered to respond.It has been necessary to go through hassle of having my credit card company deny the charge....Don't know if this honest mistake or fraud but am disappointed in Amazon for not communicating with me on this...
5,One of Bresson's best,"I only recently watched this film for the first time yesterday. Being a Bresson fan, I can't believe I waited so long. Using his spare, ascetic style, Bresson achieves levels of near-unbearable tension. The emphasis on the arduousness and banality of Fontaine's escape preparations are fascinating. As a viewer, you really come away with a sense of time. Despite this emphasis on banality, the film still blisters by.For those who have tried Bresson in the past and didn't warm to the likes of The Pickpocket, The Devil Probably or Diary of a Country Priest, I would recommend giving him one more shot. Although it contains typical Bresson elements, it's packaged together in a more easily enjoyable way."
4,A Man Escaped--so did the print,"This is one of cinema's great achievements, a testament of the combination of elements (subject, visual style, photographic image, movement, sound, background music, character, montage) are perfectly blended into a unique experience. The New Yorker print, however, is the worst copy of this film (16mm, 35mm, television screenings) I have ever seen. This was a copy with a lack of contrast, extra noise on the track, looking like a dub. If only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice. As it is, enjoy what you're stuck with but know there's something better out there.Burt Shapiro"
5,One of the Early Best Films of the 50's,"This film is absolutely wonderful but when examined closer, it is merely a simple film and that is the main power. In what it is trying to express, a man who attempts to escape from a Gestapo prison camp, it relates to the existential values at the time. I have never seen a more crisp telling of a drama told in straight forward narrative and easy dialog. What is at the basis of this fabulous Bresson film is man's determinism in the face of imprisonment. Truly recommended."
2,Not as nice as I thought it would be. The tray was flimsy and could only accomodate 4 players.,The tray was flimsy and could only accomodate 4 players. We have as many as 7 or 8 that wish to play.
3,ok,We had a Tripoley game we used for years that wore out. This one is not near as good. The cups for holding chips or coins are too small. We really don't like having to assemble it every time.
3,Doesnt' Rotate,"My kids enjoy playing this game. I wish that you didn't have to disassemble it to put it back in the box. That is inconvenient. Additionally, the description indicates it ""Includes rotating turntable playing tray"", and that is inaccurate. The playing surface is stationary and does not rotate."
4,Chip holders too small for chips,"We love the game of Tripoley and so does our 4-year-old granddaughter. The only complaint we have with this game versus much older versions is that you can't fit very many chips in the holders.We all know how the pots for the King&Queen; and the 8,9,&10 often build to large amounts. Due to the limited number of chips and small holders, we are constantly borrowing from those two pots. However, we love the game and would still recommend buying it."
2,Overpriced plastic,"The set has a decent enough board that you have to put together, but the cards are difficult to shuffle or deal and the chips are very cheap-feeling. At least the instructions are quite adequate, but that's not why you're spending this much."
1,tripoley diamond,"the discription talks about a lazy susan, which this product did not come with. I feel the game is good for a max. of 4 people on a small card table . If you have more then 4 people playing the chip holders are going to be to small and the board is also on the small size. The manufacturer did not give much thought to the design and should not be calling it a diamond edition."
5,An author who influenced Austen.,"Reading that Burney was influential in the life of Austen made her more interesting to read. Evelina, written of life in the 18th century, lacks depth of characters which Austen mastered beautifully. Yet, the epistolary form which Burney used added delight to the read.In modern day, Evelina and the women surrounding her would infuriate most females one knows. Some of the prissy behaviors seemed contrived. The revelry of the men gave the impression that the males of the time were soft headed, careless and foppish.Some of the rules and behaviors surprised me as the note that Lord Orville sends Evelina which makes her fly out of London in a tizzy. It seemed harmless, yet Burney intimates that it was not to be done at her time.On the whole it was an enjoyable read and made me want to look further into her writing."
4,A Surprisingly Modern 18th Century Novel,"Although not in the class of Jane Austen, the earlier writings of Fanny Burney contributed a great deal to the evolution of the novel. No mere romance, Fanny Burney's Evelina gives us a surprisingly modern heroine--modern both in her proto-feminist awareness of the world and in her ""mixed"" character. Evelina is not a paragon, and Burney's writings are neither mere pleasant fantasies of romance, nor cumbersome stories of impossible virtue. Like Richardson, Fanny Burnery was creating something very new in the 18th century: a psychological novel. Unlike Richardson (whose best-loved novel, Clarissa, has been described--by fans of his, mind you!--as ""That long, still book."") Fanny Burney's books withstand the time travel down to our day. Evelina is--thus far, at least!--my favorite of her books."
3,The Time Machine,"The Time Machine is mostly about a guy who takes a journey through time.The Time Traveller first shows his peers his mini model of the Time Machine. Then he goes into the future. When he gets back he tells them about his experience. First he met the Eloi, then he met the Morlocks. After awhile he wants to return back home and realizes the Time Machine is missing. Then he meets a White Sphinx, then he met a girl named Weena. Following this he finds his Time Machine and returns back to 1809. After telling the rest of his adventure he disappeared and never came back."
4,A fun journey,A trip for the imagination and a story that lingers long after reading. Colorful and evocative language makes for a fun and quick read. Very hard to put down once the story is in motion!
3,Rewind!!!,"Two parts I liked was when the Time Traveller went down into the well and met the Morlocks and I liked the part where the Time Traveller went into the Spinx and was almost trapped by the Morlocks. There were several settings in the book: the first was the Time Travellers house in 1899, the second setting was the future where the Eloi and Morlocks lived in 802,701, and the last setting was the very distant future where almost no life exsists but for a few very strange creatures.The main conflict of the story was when the Morlocks stole the Time Machine stranding the Time Traveller in the future. The problem was resolved by the Time Traveller entering the Spinx and taking the Time Machine back.TTE"
5,The Time Machine,The Time Machine is classic in literture. It is one of the best books written in SF as well as the any other genre. It is a book that I will share with my kids. This book is a must have for any home library.
3,Amazing creativity,For having been written in the 19th century I'm truly impressed with his total scientific and exploration foresight. A must read for those with an incessant need for exploration both mentally and physically.
4,"It was an all together good book,","As a high schooler I was forced to read this novel, but I'm glad. It was really written in good text, and I liked the well thought up characters names. (Eloi's & Morlocks) I have also read his other novels; Island of Dr. Moreau and I have also seen the movie. H.G. Wells is an excellent writter and his books deserve more credit."
5,Fantastic!,"One of the easiest reads I've come across (got through it in just a couple hours). The Time Machine is a classic, of course, but it's definitely worth reading again. Wells' narrative throughout the novel is unique and really makes the book hard to put down! The visual imagery is stellar and works to paint a picture of what the author saw in his mind when he wrote it.Absolutely pure fun and an enjoyable read, with plenty of suspense and interesting characters. And for the Kindle price of FREE it's definitely worth it."
5,An Amazing Classic,"The Time Machine is a book I read once in high school (from the school library), loved it, and for some reason or another have never come back to it again until recently. While scanning through the time travel section, (yes, I am a time travel fiction die hard), this cover caught my attention, and when I noticed it was H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, I decided it was time for me to revisit this classic story and pick up this edition. Wells writes efficiently, never unnecessarily verbose, yet he still paints a fully developed story. While his classic style may be off-putting for those on the short end of the attention span range, I find Wells' style to be elegant and intriguing. It's a milestone in scifi, time travel stories, and even literature as a whole. I enjoyed it as much in my 30s as I did in my teens."
4,Old and good,"It's a classic. If you think of the time when it was written, you can find amazing the kind of theories that were pioneered with this book, and how influential it was in many other science-fiction writing about time-travelling. A must read."
5,Withstanding the Test of Time,"The Time Machine is a very interesting book about a man(referred to as ""The Time Traveler"")'s adventures in the future. While there, he loses his time machine and has to go through many trials of courage, ingenuity, and curiosity. The Time Machine speculates greatly on what would happen by the year 802,701. The Traveler surmises that at some point in time, the human race achieved perfect social equilibrium. His theory evolves and grows as he learns more and more about the future. Throughout the book, though, it is always asserted that these theories are assumed from his surroundings, not correct per se. This leaves a nice touch of uncertainty that makes this book so enjoyable to read."
1,The Time Machine,I think due to the age of the book it was very hard to hold my interest in the story. Actually the best part of the book is the last 5 or 6 pages. I won't reveal any of that in case you really want to read it.
3,Okizzile,I thought the Book was enertaing and fun. It is a little far out for my taste. I think the charecters can use some sharpeing. I think there should have been more develepment between the charecters. I think this a perfect book for the sci-phy thrillers.I hope my review gets out.Roger
5,It really takes hold of you the further you get into it!,"I recently got a nook and in that process I picked up a ton of the classics. This is one of my favorites! The book started off slowly with a man talking to numerous ""educated"" friends about a time machine he was building but it picked up when he actually went through time to a world very different from the one he lived in then and we live in today. He goes on a wild adventure which he passes on as a story to his friends who meet him with a lot of doubt. So eventually he takes off again but where he goes nobody knows. An excellent book that will take you to places you've never been before."
5,Time Traveler,"Ah, what memories! I had a stack of Classics Illustrated when I was a kid and The Time Machine was my favorite. I feel like a kid seeing these panels again for the first time in fifty years and remembering so many of the drawings - true time travel! The art work is superbly rendered, looks great on my kindle hd. Included at the back of the book is a good article on the artists and writer who produced the original in 1956. Don't miss it."
5,Simply timeless,"As a previous reviewer has stated, having seen both versions of the film, it made sense for me to finally get around to read the book. What a wonderful experience!The story is only 80 pages long in the version I own but what a wallop it packs. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and, being very young when I first saw the 1960 movie version on TV, never grasped the social statement until now. The parable literally hit home even more since living in Los Angeles you see the Eloi getting their lawns mowed by the Morlocks every day.If you are like me who likes to grab a classic in between the current mystery or ghost stories you may enjoy more often, make sure you add this one to your list."
2,My Review,"The Time Machine is about a man called the Time Traveller who's goes to the future to find out that the future is not at all what he thought it would be like. Throughout this journey he ends up losing his Time Machine.He Saving his new companion Weena and fights off the vicious Morlocks. When I first picked up this book I could tell just by the vocabulary that it was going to be challenge but I knew I could take it. After finshing I really wished I hadn't. Reading this book was painful because i had to read for class and I couldnt just put it down without failing. As you can see i gave this book 2 stars and that was because it had a really good hook and grabbed my attention, but after about a chapter it lost my attention. I felt this book was very boring and ending was horrible. I did not at all think it was worth my time."
3,Lua p-5,"Honestly, The Time Machine seemed boring to me at first. Maybe its because to understand it I practically should of had a dictionary sitting next to me. Towards the end of the book it became more clear of his message. The creatures such as the elloi were greatly described. I could imagine them next to me. H.G Wells really had a message he wanted to show. If you are dont like a boring begginning i dont think you should get this book, but if your are great with vocabulary or like to find the root and moral of a story this is a book I beleive is for you."
4,Was it all a trick?,"The plot of this classic book, which paved the way for all science fiction, is rather simple. A famous scientist, whose name we never learn, builds a time machine and disappears in it in front of his skeptical guests. He later returns and claims that he has just come back from the future, and then goes on to tell his story. The writing is clever and absorbing, and will keep you fully occupied for a few hours - all that it will take you to finish this superb novel."
2,BORING,"I had to read this book for school, and found it to be extremely boring. The whole time, one man is telling the story- he is too discriptive and is hard to understand. I do not recommend this book to anyone 13 and under."
2,My Opinion,"I think its an interesting book....thats is, it would be if I could understand half of the words. Its really well written and the story is good but who does the author expect to know what he's talking about?"
4,Good addition to the Hunter universe,The first of the Creed Books for Hunter: the Reckoning has a good mix of in-character rumors and philosophies and out-of-character rules and goodies (the new traits and edges are especially nice). Excellent insight into the Avengers of the WoD and worth a look by any Hunter STs and players.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!,"O.K. I like to play Avengers, This book lets me define them as more than a killing machine. New Powers too. You can mix them up so when you have a few Avengers around they aren't all copycats. Also the other ways of playing an Avenger are great to roleplay."
2,Drunken boring,"A rather self-serving, cold hearted, alcoholic doctor gets bored with his dull life and decides to help a small time thief and hoodlum. Great acting and directing and yet a very boring film still came out of it. The premise is too obvious and uninteresting to be worthy for a Great Kurosawa film and this film suffers because of it.Mifune and Shimura are captivating but they play great characters in a very boring and predictable story with plot developments you can see coming a mile away, by the second hour the film was dragging, and became predictable and tedious. The story is non-existent and the characters are so undeveloped that one could care less about them.So unspeakably boring that I had to turn it off each twenty minutes to walk around, and I felt I had deserved a medal for that. And, by the way, I generally love Kurosawa films."
3,Alright,This alright for learning proposes but that's it i understand there more out I guess I brought cause James lew on the cover but it goes into my collection.
1,Jack-Jack Attack,"What a waste of money. I thought this might be a cute short video for my 4 year old grandson, but I found nothing appropriate in this video for young children."
1,Does this include all six volumes or just the first?,"With a Kindle book you can't tell from the sample if it includes the whole work. The free ones just happen to leave out James I(Chapters XLV-XLIX and appendix for James 1)! Project Gutenberg forgot it too. So, I am looking for a Kindle Edition that has this included. I give it a one star because the product review doesn't tell you, and the sample doesn't have a Table of Contents!"
5,Young Wayne Newton Delievers Chrismtas Classics,This is a great Christmas collection. My personal favorites are Blue Christmas and Christmas Isn't Christmas Without You. This is a very balanced album. This album goes well with Merry Christmas from Wayne Newton (Curb Records).This album is a great way to get into the Christmas spirit. It's a very traditional Christmas album by the King of Las Vegas.
1,Kevin Sorbo is a Damn JOKE!!,"What is wrong with you people? Kevin Sorbo is good? Kevin Sorbo is the king of B-Movie garbage and lousy television. Give me a break. If I'm going to watch an awful sequel to a movie that was awful in the first place with an even lousier actor replacing the lead, I'll opt for The Substitute 2 and Treat Williams any day."
1,"Beautiful hats, terrible charts","The hat ideas are wonderful. Too bad there are so many errors in the charts. I contacted Lark books for a copy of their errata (a correction sheet for the errors in this book). What I received was a very poor photocopy of the corrected charts. The corrected charts were so small, and the photocopy was so many generations from the original, that I could absolutely not read it. I counted twenty charts from the book that have corrections! I am an experienced knitter, but I have a hard time getting into a new knitting project, knowing that the charts are wrong. I contacted Lark books repeatedly to get a cleaner, more legible copy of the errata. So far, I have received nothing. I'm very disappointed. Further, the gauge she suggests is too small. More specific instructions with regards to yarns and needle sizes would have been very helpful."
4,Wonderful patterns for the advanced knitter,"I love these designs...very creative and fun to knit. HOWEVER, this is definitely NOT a book for a beginning knitter, or for any knitter who likes to follow patterns exactly as written. In order to enjoy these clever designs, the knitter must take the time to think, and to chart out the next step...."
3,"excellent patterns, errors in instructions","The patterns are great and easy to follow once you understand the logic behind the patterns. Unfortunately, the patterns are misleading. Some call for double decreases when single decreases work"
1,"Should be titled ""Ugly hats to make for a church bizarre""","These hats are ugly, hands down. I didn't even get to the patterns or charts, because I had no interest in making such ugly hats. Don't waste your time."
4,Meditational,"This is the only pure Chenrezig chant I have been able to find on the entire web. Others attempt to play music with the chant or add unrealistic echos to where it sounds like the chanter is in a massive cave. This CD allows one to hear a musical rendition of the chant in the beginning, but in the third piece, allows only a monk's small, wooden block and bell to be heard for a tempo. It is definately not Buddhist monks chanting, but the words themselves, the Sacred Mantra of Om Mani Peme Hung is heard in its purity."
1,not very helpful,"I see the author is trying to pump it up but this is not a very good book. Poor examples; v. little Access, best to spend your money else where."
1,Poor style,"The writing style of the author too poor. He explain all the source code of the project and put it (source code) on the next page. It is very difficult to browse it steps, the book also less screen shot. Unlike Visual Basic .Net Programming which author by Harold Davis is writing in a good style. He explain the piece of code one bye one and finally he show the complete procedure. Screen are always show in the page of explaination. Finally the explaination is good but the writing style should improve."
3,worse than a 7 dollar walmart knife,the thumb studs are useless and the frame lock is way to tight. it cannot be opened with one hand. its pretty but that about it. The blade stays sharp forever but only because it can't be opened.
5,Arizona: A History by Thomas E. Sheridan,"Sheridan makes the history (which I've always found to be boring)of Arizona interesting. His wit in writing keeps my attention. He talks of the people of Arizona like he knew them personally and makes me want to meet them. He gives a thorough review of time from Arizona's earliest known history of the Hohokom peoples, early industries, issues involed with statehood to more recent history including the establishment of national parks and tourism. Sheridan explains how Arizona's politics have been shaped by large industries mainly mining. This in an excellent and enlightening read even if you aren't much interested in history."
2,Twisted History,"I have just finished Sheridan's book of Arizona history; I was disappointed to say the least. While there were numerous factoids on events/names, many of them did not seem relevant to the current topic at all, they were just thrown in to ""wow"" the reader with his knowledge of Arizona.Most importantly, the history of Arizona itself, as presented in the book, was twisted and manipulated with Sheridan's overt liberal view on the subject matter."
1,Current DVD Version Looks AWFUL,"I had originally seen this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel years ago and thought it was great. I was really excited when the DVD came out. However, as is too often the case with DVD's, the movie was NOT ""remastered""; visually it's too dark & grainy to be enjoyable. At least ""Akira"" was ""spiffed up proper"" for its DVD release. There IS a trailer for the REMAKE that looks comparable to today's standard of quality anime; wait for that version!!"
4,better than the original,"i found the movie very entertaining, and it beats the original in every aspect. i first saw this movie a couple months back, and i had to have it and bought it toady. great characters and animation, and a good plot. the climaz was executed very well indeed, but not as good as the original climax, when D was revealed to be the descendent of Dracula(big shock). its unique in the sense that there arent any clear heroes, they are all pretty much villians in that aspect. the movie is sorta similiar to ninja scrolls, because of all the wierd enemies with special abilities, but beyond that, completely different. if you liked the original, i highly suggest this sequel. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because 2 reasons. almost everything on amazon is 5 stars, and 2, akira is still my fav anime, so it was obvious i compared the two. but dont get me wrong, you wont be dissapointed at the least. shot out to neo-anime w00t!!!"
4,Much improved,"Anyone who says the original was better has to watch it over and then tell me the better of the two. The new movie has a better story, better art, better character designs, and leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction. No reason for me to write any more."
5,THE WORTHY SEQUEL!,"I BOUGHT AN ADVANCE COPY ON DVD FROM ELECTRONIC BOUTIQUE AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I ENJOYED THE MOVIE AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED THE ORIGINAL. IT IS BEAUTIFUL AND FUN TO WATCH. IT'S GOT A GOOD STORY THAT WON'T DISSAPOINT. IF YOU LIKE THE ORIGINAL GIVE THIS ONE A CHANGE. IF YOU ARE SKEPTICAL THEN RENT IT FIRST AT YOUR LOCAL BLOCKBUSTER, WHEN IT COMES OUT THERE. BUT IF YOU BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT. TRUST ME."
3,"Okay, but garbage at some times","This movie was a pretty good movie for it's good action scenes and dramatic storyline but it was garbage alot of times. Like: HIS HAND TAlKS TO HIM!!!!!! which was very stupid, but is was pretty good."
3,ok,Quality wasn't as good as expected. Looked like it was copied from a vhs. Still going to keep it though.
3,"Go for Bloodlust, not this one","Actually, when I saw D for the first time I was quite disapointed... no cool animations, no artistic colors or graphics, etc. The movie looks like some kind of old animé, when I started to watch it I though it was a 70's animé. Anyway, the story is really good, and I recomend this one before watching bloodlust, ... But actually, if you're looking for cool animé with graphics and animations like Ninja scroll, Akira, or ghost in the shell, then get Vampire Hunter D bloodlust, not this one."
4,Almost perfect score,Vampire Hunter D is an excellent anime movie! The artwork is beautiful and this sequel definitely surpasses the first. I will say that the story was good except for the ending..which could have been written better. Other than that...it is a must for any anime collecter.
4,"Better, are you serious","The movie is entertaining but better than the original, you must be joking, not even close"
1,Cant compare.,"For all the hype over this one, it is really disappointing. The animation was fairly well done(it is older) but the story was not up to par. The hand was ridiculous. For everyone who loves this movie, try Nausicaa, Macross Plus, My Neighbor Totoro, Laputa, Ruronui Kenshin, or the easier to find Ninja Scroll or Ghost in the Shell. I think that you all might like these better."
3,No japan track!!,I payed full retail price instead of picking up a pirated copy (with japan) track at graywhale because I wanted extra features (like on Princess Mononoke) (the whole point of DVD anime).Of course you get lots of reviews but on the english side.Even though I don't know japanese I love the way they sound and how much more comical some things are.I felt [unsatisfied] by paying more and with no japan track.But it's still a great work of art.
1,awful in comparison to bloodlust,"If i could have given this zero star i would have. I saw VHD bloodlust and was amazed. I've watched many animated films that were reviewed as ""you'll be amazed at the story"" and i was thoroughly drilled with bullets of disapointment. This had potential and fell short...WAY SHORT. Bloodlust (the sequel) however amazed the life out of me and until its arrival i thought i would never find such amazement in an anime film since production IG's work. If your into any anime and it doesn't matter what it is you may enjoy this. If your looking for something that pushes the bar and really entertains try the sequel. Please don't waste your time on this, its not worth it. Animation, american voice-acting and general story sucked! I found myself fast-forwarding through bits and i haven't done that in a film other than Starship Troopers 2. The sequel excells, go for it. This film wastes money. Your money."
1,i gave it one star because none wasnt an option,"good lord this was bad, i dont know how anyone could possibly enjoy this. The animation is terrible, the story line substandard at best, i had the misfourtune to see the dubbed version, which may have contributed to the cheesy and stupid dialogue, but no dubbing no matter how horrible could cause a movie to be this bad. Don't waste your money, or time."
5,Perfect...,"This ranks with Princess Mononoke and The Ghost in the Shell as the finest works in anime.Breakdown:Animation: This movie uses an animation style I haven't seen before, and it fits perfectly with the dark, gothic storyline. The colors are rich and the motions are fluid. The scenes are also extremely full, no minimalism here.Sound: The musical score fits right in with the movie and the ""dub"" is excellent. That's probably because this *isn't* a dub. This movie's orignal language actually is English.Storyline (a few spoilers): This isn't your usual good-vs.-evil romp, here. It has a much more ambiguous moral compass than most movies. And it is much better for it. It is really a story about hope, love, and the way people treat (and mistreat) each other.If you have a chance to see this in the theater, DO IT. And when it comes out on DVD/VHS, pick it up. I will."
2,Possibly the WORST quality in Anime!!!!,"I only gave it 2 stars because of the girl! (SHE IS SO HOT!) and maybe the concept is COOL but the rest was HORRENDOUS.The graphics are smudgy, the animation is the WORST EVER, the action scenes were poorly choreographied, the sound is annoying and the camera shots were slow and poorly addapted!Better buy the sequel witch is everything opposite to what I said.Adios."
1,This doesn't even deserve ONE star,"It has so much bloodshed in it that you'll be wanting to set fire to yourself just to escape this blodd-obssessed mistake.This movie has animation ripped off of ""Gundam Wing"" and the characters grate on your nerves with irritating voices that will give you a head-splitting migraine after 5 seconds.The musical score is god-awful and there is no plot.If you're expectinbg a plot in this dus,you'll be sadly mistaken-all you'll find is a movie that consists of nothing but ongoing violence and bloodshed.You'll be asking yourself""where's the plot?why isn't there a storyline in here?"" over and over again as you try hard to keep focused to this flop.After 5 seconds,you'll be wanting to rip this DVD out of the player and smash the DVD into itty-bitty pieces with a sledge-hammer.That's how irritating and annoying this flop is."
3,classic anime,"Vampire Hunter D was released in 1985 and is certainly a classic. One of the extras on the DVD showed the animators sitting in a small room creating each frame by hand. When compared to modern animation such as Ninja Scroll, Ghost In The Shell or Titan AE, this movie seems quite dated. However, the story is well done and the plot becomes quite tense at times. Lots of blood and strange creatures/mutants and the ending battle between D and the head vampire is great. While not the best animation I've ever seen, this is a classic movie for any anime DVD collection."
5,Important for all Taikiken practioners!,This is a very good book by Sawai Sensei that explains the basics and advanced methods of Taikiken. It have helped me a lot and a strongly recommend it for all that practice taikiken.
5,Wow.,"Seeing this book on the shelf for many years, I had a preconceived idea of what it may be like. I thought it was going to be detailed, dry reading about those living in a mental institution. I couldn't be more wrong. This story was told as a first person narrative and gave the reader the opportunity to drop any stereotypes he or she may have concerning mental illness. The characterization was fantastic. The ending, for me, was quite a surprise. The characters and story will stay with me for quite some time."
5,The Greatest Novel Ever Written!,"Kesey grabs you, and puts you up to a horrifying peephole with this book. You see through the eyes of each character, and become addicted to their world. You will not be able to put this book down, nor should you.This novel is a life-changing account of American Society. These tormented souls reveal a world that we would never wish upon any one; yet it is the world we live in..."
3,In Appreciation of a good novel,"I personally think that the book was a real interesting book. The way the author put everything into perspective. It began a little slow, however the contents were extremely elaborate. I enjoy the book and I highly recommend everyone to read it."
5,comic book comes to life!,"like the Book of Revelations has done to the New Testament, Kesey's tale is just as important to the counter-cultural events that took place following its publication.I have never read a book like it before or since, and though I likewise love Notion, this is Kesey's true masterpiece.*Hands down Randle P. McMurphy is my favorite character in any book I have ever read and though Nicholson is one of my all-time favorites, even he couldn't come close to touching him."
3,0ne Flew 0ver the Cuck00's nest...in my dreams...,"a book filled with conflict and and cliff hangers...overall i believe this book is one of my favorite books i've read in school..it's up there with to kill a mockingbird, the catcher and they rye, the giver, and the joy luck club. this book allows you to look into many different perspectives while giving great imagery and allowing yourself to create and picture in your mind. it is filled with surprise, fun and devastating occurences. though it is sort of a difficult book to get through..i believe dedication to reading the book..you will learn to like it."
5,Wow...,"I love this book. I think it is absolutely genius. It just...I can't describe it. There is no other way to explain how I feel about this book.Just to add, the Penguin ""Great Books of the Century"" edition is the best to get. Not only does it have a beautiful (shiny) cover with an illustration of Chief Bromden, it is a sturdy and light copy. Plus the text is well spaced (unlike the mass market edition; the text in that edition hurts my eyes, it's so small and cramped). A great edition to keep of a great book."
5,THE BEST,"This book is an interesting insight into the minds of people who are, well ""different"". People who suffer a mental disease. The most interesting thing about this book, is how it expresses what might happen when their all so fragile world of ""right"" & ""wrong"" is polluted by a man who represents the rebellious society. This book is littered with people who represent all different aspects of society. This book is brilliantly written and worded, it is delivered with skill and beauty. This book is often compared to the Catcher and the Rye, I peronally believe that there is NO comparison. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ALL!"
2,I can't read.,"This wasn't a very easy book to read. It was kind of difficult to understand. Although, I was able to manage with reading about half of the book. It's hard to understand because the story is being told from the view of a mental patient. Bromden is often hallucinating and it's hard to know at times whether he's talking about the real world or if he's in his own world. Then there's McMurphy. Sometimes I wonder about him. He doesn't seem as though he has any mental issues. He just seems like a normal guy, always trying to get what he wants, when he wants. He often messes around with the other patients and takes advantage of their disabilities. Not only does he mess with the patients, though, he also tries to play games with Nurse Ratched as well. All I know is that if the book was a little easier to understand, and things were a little more clear I would have finished reading it because I did think the plot was rather interesting, but it just wasn't easy to read."
5,McMurphy or Christ?,"One more quick note: if you plan to read this novel, keep your eyes open for Christ imagery. Once recognized, it is truly moving. ""And McMurphy led the twelve of us to the sea..."" (= 12 apostles). Good luck and Happy Reading!!"
5,A masterpiece of the word!,"Ken Kesey was ever a master of language and expressed ideas, but 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' takes his writing into a new dimension.The novel inextricably links evil to society, demonstrating the power it wields and how we are forced to reconcile with it to survive. 'Kesey' focuses on the occupants of a mental hospital - a microcosm of the outside world - and whilst reading about the redemption of the in-mates after years of mental torture and abuse the reader is forced to assess how much society controls his own life, and more specifically, whether he has any choice in it.The imagery is beautiful and the moods and emotions of the in-mates are consigned to writing in an easy mannor which would shame most of today's writers. Easy to read - impossible to put down.Prepare to be enlightened!"
2,Difficult for a teen to understand.,"I know it's supposed to be a classic. But this book was very challenging for me, a 13-year-old, so I wasn't able to get much out of it."
3,respectable -- but dull,"One flew over the Cuckoos nest didn't impress me much. Ken Kessey is a respectable writer although his stories don't appeal to me. Yes, there were times when you were cheering certain characters on, but the whole book was less than I had expected. Although the ending was appropriate, it wasn't favorable(to me at least). When read out loud you caught the humor, but it was easy to miss otherwise. The author had good ideas, but for some reason this book didn't strike me."
4,Be careful how you approach those in power.,"The hero made a mistake...he wanted out of the sun, out of the hard days spent working county land for no personal gain. He fakes insanity...too well. Winding up in the asylum, he finds that though he's only faking, he's still crazier than many of his fellows. But he enjoys it, and pulls them together. One of the top 100 books I have read."
4,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest- A Flight to Freedom,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a well-written book about a man named McMurphy. McMurphy is placed in an aslyum because the courts declared him a physcopath. McMurphy isn't insane. He's just looking for a free ride so that he doesn't have to go back to work on the pea farm he was at before he was arrested.Over all, I would recommend One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to anyone who is looking for a book that touches the mind and tears at the heart. Kesey demonstrates great knowledge of how the human mind works and to what extent a man will go to keep his sanity in an insane world.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest is a definate read. It continues to draw readers into its realm of sanity within insanity. Of human perseverence under a dictator's rule. Of man's indomitable will to survive."
4,Kesey's Loony Bin,"There is no story quite like Ken Kesey's One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest. It is an incredible tale of a man who single-handedly brings life back to the inmates of an Oregon mental hospital. It is a tale of hope, desire, and of living life to the fullest. Hope is represented by the freewheeling Randle McMurphy who makes it his mission to save his fellow inmates from the terrible rule of Nurse Ratched. The battle of wits between the nurse and McMurphy becomes the essence of this story. It symbolizes something much bigger than the petty poer struggle it appears to be; this is the power-hungry versus the oppressed. Author Ken Kesey has managed to maintain a humorous tone in the gloomiest of settings with a cast of some of the most animated characters I have ever come across. From the POV of a hospital inmate, the story puts the reader right inside the walls of this loony psych ward. Read it and find your way out."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I'd could write for days about all the reasons that this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, about how it flips your perception of others, makes you re-evaluate your life, abolishes all previous assumptions about ""insanity"". All I can say is READ THIS BOOK. It will change your life, and it's incredibly entertaining... as a bonus."
1,A disappointment,"I am currently reading this book for my H English 10 class, and i find it to be extremely dull. Yes, I understand, it takes everyone a step deeper into the lives of the mentally challenged people of our time. However, it is a difficult book to follow. There is a constant changing of characters, which lead me into great confusion of the importance each one displayed within the text. I was very disappointed when I began reading this book. I always heard great things about it, but i guess, it's just not my cup of tea."
1,#1 Reader,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. Amazon states that it is a Hardcover Book. But it is the size of a paperback, with a ""cardboad"" cover. The book does not have a ""jacket"". The print is very small. Amazon should make it clear as to exactly what you are buying. (I love the story - but it is the quality of the ""Hardcover Book"" that is very disappointing)."
4,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Ken Kesey does a great job of making you feel connected to his characters. He does such a good job you almost think they are real. Another thing Ken Kesey did a good of was constantly changing the theme which kept you interested. It also had a very emotional and unexpected ending which makes this book great. I would recommend it to any one with a high shcool or higher reading level.
4,"Another movie book, much better than the movie","An absolute classic. A great, fast moving read. As most seem to be, the book is far better and more timeless than the movie."
3,"Well, Well, Well.","When you read this book one of two things will happen. You will either become entranced by the story and finish it within a day, or you will relegate it to become one of those novels that steals small fractions of you life bit by bit until you finish it weeks later. For myself I was prepared to devour this book in one sitting. Instead, I consumed it slowly and savoured it like a delicious wine. It is a truly amazing story that will keep you enthralled whether you read it slow or fast. The characters will not remain with you forever, but you will respect them and find yourself thinking about them shortly after you read this book. Bravo to the story and all those involved in bring this facinating tale to readers. 5 stars for story, -2 stars for delivery"
2,Slow going,"Rabbit Proof Fence was a slow going book; you had to really have the will to continue reading. The first 50 pages consisted of Doris Pilkington describing the history of Western Australia in the late 1800's/early 1900's. It was slightly confusing since she skipped between different tribes and places, all of which are in a completely different language- sometimes full sentences would be in an aboriginal dialect. She then followed a couple of young girls. It finally started to get interesting and worthwhile. But then, instead of the book reaching the climax and enthralling you, it loses it. I got completely bored for the last 75 pages; it seemed as though it was the same thing happening over and over. The ending also seemed quite rushed, as though she had to fit it in a certain number of pages. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are obsessed with Australian history or know how to read many confusing aboriginal languages."
2,M*E*G*O,"Sorry folks I just could not get through this book. Unanimously the ""critics"" said the first 50 pages were disorganized and tedious. I read up to page 10, ""zzzz"" I then skipped ahead to page 50 thinking ""OK NOW the action will begin"" nope just more of the same rambling sentences. I am keeping the book for its historical reference, and maybe someone else will read it and then convince me of the story's value.M*E*G*O = My Eyes Glazed Over!"
5,Rabbit proof fence,this is a great book. should be read by everybody. it's a nice reminder that we have lots of work to do.True story and it has been around for a while even made into a movieRead the book
4,"This is the ""standard"" dictionary of Talmudic Aramaic.","This dictionary of Talmudic Aramaic is in such wide use that any student of the Talmud knows what is meant when told to ""look in Jastrow."" Nowdays, there are many additional sources one may turn to. For example, ""The Practical Talmud Dictionary,"" by Frank and ""Aiding Talmud Study"" by Carmel are valuable at explicating the specialized logical terms in the Talmud, and the Soncino English translation is helpful in understandintg difficult textual passages. However, there is still no true substitute for ""the Jastrow,"" and it belongs in the library of every student of the Talmud."
1,Buy this if you don't want to hear or have the other caller hear you...,"The email thing is great you get them right away and the color on screen is great. But getting to the internet takes forever, the speaker phone don't work, people cannot hear me on this phone. They say I sound like I'm underwater sometimes, or it rattles, just a horrible phone! I am on my third one blackberry won't do anything about it. They just keep sending me new phones. Don't buy!"
3,Critical functions missing,"Everything else that's written as a review here is true, so I'll stick with the complaints.1. No voice functionality. If they put Bluetooth on the phone, I'd like voice dialing. Not there.2. No Voice memo. Yep, e-mail, games, and IM, but no Voice memo.3. T-Mobile has eliminated the attachment of Images to e-mails!You can open word docs, excel spreadsheets and PDF's and the manual says image files as well, but T-mobile does not support this feature. (please call to complain, this is a critical omission that should, and can be fixed)4. No Camera. OK, this is the reason I got the phone. There are a lot of places you cannot take camera phones. My phone cannot have a camera. This one works for me.Other than that it's a great phone and worth the $$$, talks well with MS Outlook, browser works well and IM is good. Odd keybord takes a bit but works great after 30 minutes of ""typing""only 3 stars until T-Mobile allows image attachments."
1,Using Philosophy to defend Christianity,"This is a good book for a Christian Fundamentalist that is looking to use Philosphy to support their beliefs rather than challenge. My take is that the Consequences of Ideas for Sproul is how ideas potentially lead you away from fundamentalist beliefs. For example, his simplistic refutation of Darwin represents a cliche of Christian thought of the 20th Century.I don't recommend this book one based on its method and also based on its constant errored summaries. For example, page 163, on his treatment of Nietzche: ""The will to power may be link to modern paradignms such as people's attempt to rise to the top of the pyramid, an adult version of ""King of the Hill"""". That is not what is Nietzche was saying at all and is completely inaccurate.Philosophy is so much more than what Sproul has given. We can actually learn from the critiques of the history and use them to open our mind rather than close it."
4,Angels in the Gloom,"Anne Perry is amazingly able to create a timescape - she does that in all her series - this one is no exception. While I like the plot what I love is the feeling of stepping back into the 2nd decade of the last century. I have studied WWII but WWI is a tragedy I wasn't as familiar with. The whole episode was truly heartbreaking, it took and changed so many lives. It also changed the entire fabric of British society and this is well illustrated. Reading novels of quality can give a sense of perspective that factual history book do not. This series does that very well."
3,What Happened?,"I have been eagerly awaiting the 3rd book in this series concerning WWI. I had a hard time staying with it. It was not as enthralling as the first two, maybe because it was set in England rather than the battlefields? The characters seemed to have trouble making up their minds all through the book. I hope the next one is better!!!"
5,.....you won't regret spending time reading this book,"Max Lucado has vividly expressed in this book how much God loves us and supports us in our Christian life. After reading this book, one will yearn more on loving and serving Him. I think I'm gonna have collection of Max Lucado's books."
3,Very good introduction/refresher for digital wedding photography.,This book is suited for weekend amateurs photographers who may be still be shooting film but want to consider going digital.Consider this book a good INTRODUCTION to digital photography obviously skewed towards wedding coverage. It is also a good refresher for advanced amateurs.
3,"Strong photographs, weak on techniques","If you're looking for a book that illustrates wedding photography in broad strokes, this book is fine. It talks about breaking the day down into different sections, what the photographer likes to have in her bag, some post-processing filters she uses, etc... However the treatment is on the shallow end in detail.On the back of the book it says ""... to inspire any bride-to-be and the photographer on her special day."" I think as long as your not looking for more than inspiration, this book will be fine, however it does not really go into technical depth on the challenges and techniques to handle those challenges that a wedding photographer will encounter.It's really aimed more at inspiration than instruction."
2,But what about DCOM?,"One of the most difficult books I've ever tried to discern. I'm a C and Ingres 4GL programmer who needs to get into Microsoft Visual J++ and DCOM, and this was not the book for me. From the earliest chapters, it seemed that the author was eager to explain everything except how to use DCOM and what the point of it was. Long chapters on alternatives to DCOM didn't tell me much about DCOM. It would have been most helpful to learn how to use DCOM using the typical tools available -- J++, VB6, etc. -- rather than discussions of the internals."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,Pretty powerful stuff. I keep barely have it open and it does the trick. Stuck it to the lid of my garbage can. When I had it open a little more then needed it was overwhelming every time I opened the lid.
4,Darling-Hammond offers solutions worth considering.,"Darling-Hammond not only identifies some of the problems in the education system today, but she also offers some solutions that merit consideration. She contends that the bureaucracy of education has worked against many students, resulting in their not learning. Policies, practices, and skills must be changed if education is to be reformed. Some of the changes discussed include decision-making which involves teachers, restructuring time in the schools, organizing staff into teams, creating smaller schools, using authentic assessments, providing opportunities for continuing professional development, and creating standards for student learning. Darling-Hammond describes some of the inequalities that still exist in schools today, such as a lack of funding, resources, and quality teachers. Major policy changes are necessary to improve the schools, and these policies must be considered together with the practices for change to be effective."

4,The Natural,"At first I was forced to read this book. I didn't want to really it sounded very boring. But when I began to compare how the book relates to the ""American Dream"" I found that I was quickly drawn it the plot. It is a very rich story of a normal man (Roy Hobbs) and his strive to be what everyone wants to be, the best. He keeps valiantly on his steady search. Though he stumbles on the bumps in the road, he keeps going. In his pursuit of happiness he experiences joy, sadness, loss and even love."
5,Great book for all Intelligent sports people out there.,"This is a book that uses outstanding imagery to portray the lifestyle of a major league hero to a flawed homeric character. It uses human struggles, as do all of Malamud's novels, to bring a new enlightenment to baseball and it's heroes."
4,The Unlikley Legend,"The novel The Natural by Bernard Malamud is one of the most thrilling novels I've ever read. It takes you through the ups and downs in the life of Roy Hobbs. At times the book became hard to understand because it seems to jump back and forth through time. Malamud does a superb job of revealing the characters' inner throughts and feelings. The setting is often changing, but the imagery makes them easy to picture. Malamud seems to throw you off guard with his ever-changing characters. Right when you think something predictable will happen, the story does a 180. The theme of the novel is clearly unveiled through Malamud's narration and also through the characters. Overall the novel The Natural was a tremendous book. I would recommend it to people who like to read about overcoming adversities and also to baseball fans."
2,The screen play was better,"I, like others, was also disappointed with this book. Having seen the movie before reading the book, I am amazed at the contrast. I was unable to care about the book Roy Hobbs because of his apparent incurable stupidity, inabiltiy to learn from his mistakes, and ultimatly his failure. His unfailing self-centeredness is annoying, and the use of dream imagery is boring and distracting. I was looking for something inspiring, and instead, got something dark and unfulfilling."
1,It's ok,"The product works fine but after two weeks of normal cell phone use it's starting to fall apart around the edges, the leather material is starting to peel off. Other than that it's a good case. But I don't know if I would really recommend it."
4,Short yet Packed with Inspiration,"Secrets of the Vine for Women is a small devotional style book based on John 15. In this book, Wilkinson tells a story of a vinedresser and his daughter which wonderfully illustrates and translates to the relationship between Jesus and ourselves. Through this fictitious story, she is able to explain the analogies that Christ used of vines, branches, etc. Having never been on a vineyard, these explanations are much appreciated!Wilkinson also included a study guide at the back of the book. There are seven questions for each chapter. I found the study guide to be very helpful and beneficial while reading through this book. If you find yourself in need of a short devotional that's jam packed with inspiration, be sure to pick up Secrets of the Vine for Women!(note: I received a complimentary copy of this book to review. All opinions in this review are my own.)"
3,charlie's review,I think that this book is a great book for all ages it exprecises the feelings of poe.
2,"Combo Tuning fork, hammer, pinwheel","When I bought this I was thrilled at getting a 5 in 1 piece of equipment at a great price. But slowly my enthusiasm waned. Its too long to fit comfortably in my pocket, the finish could have been better. Finally the disk shaped attachment at the end of tuning fork broke loose and now I don't use it anymore. Inferior product at cheap price."
2,Cheap tuning fork,"Screw in pieces tend to rattle around when using the tuning fork and taking them out doesn't help because the pinwheel is also vibrates. The device still performs the job, just felt and sounded like a CHEAP device."
3,Fun for all,We ordered this kit for my son to give as a fathers day gift. He wanted to ordered it so they could do some mgic together.They learned the tricks with in a day and had some quality time together.
2,Cheap Product,I was dissapointed with this loupe. It is just a cheap Chinese rip off of other types I have used for years. It is usable but the lens rattles in side the frame. I wish I paid more for a better one.
3,Very Large,The big is very nice but it is much larger than I thought it would be. This bag should only be used as a beach bag or maybe even an over night bag.
3,"A great idea, but...","This is something your kids will definitely love: an instant camera that produces photos that can be made into stickers. My 5year old got so excited when she was told what this camera does. However, the photo quality is just not very good. The photos seem to stick well enough, but they don't look very good. One photo taken in low light did not develop at all, so the flash did not do its job. Plus the instructions are completely unclear as to how to advance the film. It just tells you to pull, without saying when you have pulled enough. Had I not received it free from ... , I would certainly return it."
2,"Interesting topic, poor writing","This is an easy and pleasant read for those who are interested in fictional presentations of psychoanalysis. But a deep novel it is not, nor is the psychoanalytic process presented in a realistic way. A sketch, sometimes a caricature, is what comes to mind as a comparison. ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" is a much more rewarding work, both as a piece of literature and as a fictionalized account of a recovery from metal illness through psychotherapy."
1,Uninspired Soft-Hop,"All that's worth mentioning on this album are the hits 'Connected' and 'Step It Up' which, sadly, form the highlights along with the mellow 'Chicken Shake'. But it's all the same. Soft hiphop, slightly electronized, and with the interesting, kinda deep and electronic-sounding, lead vocals. All through the album. Buy a single instead, that's enough by far.When Stereo MC's do their best, they try to sound like LL Cool J, or like Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, as on 'The End'. But it's simply not that great."
2,Not for adults,The language used in the book is full of slangs.But I do not think that the book is so bad as the reviewers say.May be a good read for teenagers but not recommended for adults.
1,Disappointment,"Clancy's name is used to sell this book, but it's not written as well as other books he's been involved with. Mercifully, I abandoned this book before the halfway point. There wasn't anything about it to pull me in and give me a reason to keep going. The dialogue seemed stilted and the diction was hackneyed."
5,Net Force #6,"The newest Net Force book, Cybernation, is worth every penny. It takes place after Alex and Toni's child, Alex Jr., is born. The antagonists in this book are the people from Cybernation, a nation only existing on the net. They want to make it a real country, without any actual land. Before you read this book, I suggest you read the first 5 Net Force adult books. It is very clear and understandable if you have read the other books."
2,C'mon,"I dont understand how a lead single can be so good and the other songs be ok. The Lead single should represent what to expect on the album,I beleive, but I guess not on this because this is a Club Sounding CD, Gangsta, Pimp Tight and street money are my favorites"
1,Not as good as it sounds,"This movie sounded great to me and because I liked the first movie so much, I decided to check it out. The second movie is REALLY BAD! It doesn't even look like the sequal to Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest. I only reccommend this movie to younger kids who would probably really like it, but the second movie is HORRIBLE!!"
2,Not as good as the original.,The original was a classic. If you really like the original then get this it's a good one for the collection.
3,Yes? Maybe....,"OK, I agree the first reviwer should actually wait to see it before commenting but I have seen it - watching it now as a matter of fact. Quality leaves a bit to be desired. Production is not what we're use to in this age and time even though it is pro shot. It's grainy looking. Audio is decent but definitely a live mix, warts and all. I'd call it a bootleg with production values at best. There are no liner notes/inserts with any information - clamshell with art inserted and that's it. Performance is Yes at that time with Igor on keys and billy Sherwood setting in as well. I've seen and heard a lot better and would only recommend to completists."
2,Open your eyes ... and then squint to see the image ...,"I was very excited when I heard a televised show from this tour was coming out on DVD. This was a fantastic series of concerts, with the incredible ""Revealing Science of God"" as a centerpiece. Much to my dismay, the DVD looks like it was recorded on a worn-out piece of VHS and the sound is just plain abysmal. My dog could've done a better job mixing the audio. And while it was nice to watch a DVD where the camera stayed with performers for more than 5 seconds (is it any wonder that ADHD is the diagnosis de jour?) a few more angles and shots would've been welcome. I'm with the previous reviewer-- this is only for the completist."
2,Do Not Waste Your Money,"These phones are just simply not worth the little bit of money that they cost. First, I have no problems with my hearing and I even have a difficult time trying to hear what the person on the other end is saying (and that is with the volume on high). Second, the design looks good, but it is not so great if you like to talk on the phone and try to do things around the house at the same time. If you are like me and try to hold the phone on your shoulder while you work and talk, it will just slide out from under your ear. Third, charging this thing is next to impossible. If you don't put it on the base exactly right then it continuously beeps and says try again on the cid screen. Simply put there are a couple of other brands out there at a similar even cheaper price and those are the ones you should try first."
3,Sleep disorder review.,"Not too bad, but I was expecting something a little more racy and interesting from Jack Ketchum, given his book The Girl Next Door. This was not in that category at all."
4,dumped on doorstep,We had a kitten dumped on our doorstep in a small box. Was not much over a week if that. Buying these was the best thing I did because she was so small. She's alive and doing well.
4,Para conocedores,"Escuchar este disco me remonta a principios de los 60's cuando la guaracha cubana estaba haciendo furor en México. Quienes consideren a Celia Cruz como la fundadora de la salsa, más les valdría escuchar a su maestra. Este disco es para gozarlo de principio a fín y ¡¡cuidado, porque los pies se mueven solos!!"
4,Nice sized holes!,"The first bombilla straw that I got from a friend let a lot of leaves through but this one works quite well. You may get a little if you move it around too much or stir with it but it definitely works as intended for normal use. I really like the way it looks, too!"
1,"Not of the ""Happy Hardcore"" genre.","I've been tricked! Happy Hardcore is supposed to be a genre of techno that's fast, bouncy, and full of high-pitched female lyrics. This had none of those things. False advertising! I want my money back!(Of course, I got the CD for free, so I guess I don't have any room to gripe.)"
2,didn't work,I read an article that this would help relieve pains in my body. It did nothing to ease the pain.Betty
5,Another masterpiece by Reggie,"Reginalds work lets me see his thoughts through his eyes, he is indeed a poetry genius. His first book 'Leaving Death Row' was very good, this book is even better. 'Inside My Head' covers too many topics to list here, but each thought or view is written so well i feel i am there stood next to him seeing it too.If you want to read good poetry, written from life experiences from a very talented guy on death row, then this book is for YOU!"
1,Disappointed,"I don't usually write reviews, and I like to stay as positive as possible. But I feel I must warn others about my experience with the store/co. that tried to do business with me through Amazon.In early Nov. I requested a men's size Large of the Turfer Unixex Metro Fleece and they sent me an XXL! Somebody is either in too much of a hurry, or they don't care, or they can't read, or ALL of the above. When I brought it to the company's attention, they returned a very ""breezy,"" off-hand, reply, again reinforcing my opinion of their lack of attention to matters that count. I returned the size XXL and ordered a L. So far, I haven't heard a word from the co. that sells this item. Frankly, I've just given up. But I NEVER want to do business with them EVER again."
1,Big enough for 3 people.....no size chart,Wow....the size was so far off you could fit 2 people in this v neck sweatshirt..not happy...no size chart on the site...I want to return but they want me to pay the shipping....don't order unless you can get some kind of sizing information from them.
1,"""Fit"" People Beware","This product was received on time and in very good condition but ""fit"" people beware! First I should say that I'm 6'1"" and 170 lbs. No beer belly here... and that seems to be part of the problem with the way this product fits. (Or more accurately doesn't fit) I'm pretty sure I could curl up into a ball and fit my entire body into the torso of this ""sweater"" without stretching it out. Perhaps this was designed to fit a more ""husky"" body type. If you are short and stocky you have a better chance of being satisfied with this product."
3,Incompleat Enchanter was better,"""The Compleat Enchanter"" is, roughly, the same as ""The Incompleat Enchanter"" with an added story that I do not like as much as the other material. If you read one, there is little reason to read the other. Oh well, I read both."
4,Much better quality,"Most of you reading this will know what an important film Potemkin is and probably have another DVD or VHS version in your collection already. The restored, Ultimate Edition is worth the extra cost to replace whatever previous version you own. I had the Image DVD before and would have rated it about a C grade. The Ultimate Edition is probably a B or B+ and the music is wonderful. New better translations too. Never again will my film students laugh during the Odessa Steps sequence when the woman says ""Don't shoot - my child is sick!""I don't get a second version of a film just because of a slight improvement, but this is worth the upgrade. And if you don't already have another, this is the version to get."
4,Living Judaism review,In really good conditions.The outer cover was a bit dirty but I could easily clean it.Totally worth it.
5,One of my Faves,This CD has been one of my faves. It was one of my first Jazz CD's. I lost the CD and I'm glad I finally found it again. The songs are stuck in my head and they are easy to listen to. You'll be humming these songs for days. Sultry Frankie and Johnny to Perfidia. They all are GREAT!!
1,"Sorry, not a decent release","I love this monster movie to death. If you haven't seen it, by all means buy it. However, for those who have this or have seen it, be aware it's a fullscreen, crappy transfer. If you already got this prior to this release, save your money. You tape or dvd-r is probably better than or at least equal to the pic quality of this release. Same washed out colors, but now also ""blocky"" due to el cheapo dvd transfer. If you've never seen this movie before, this is an ok first way to see it, but it's no improvement on what has been floating out there for years on vhs and dvd-r. I'd say Cheezy Flicks puts out sub-par stuff based on this and the handful of previews of their other releases on this disk, many of which are fake widescreen. Meaning they're fullscreen with black bars across the top and bottom covering up the picture to try to fool idiots that it's widescreen. I hate companies that pull this stunt and will avoid Cheezy Flicks at all costs."
1,The Nature of Science,"the author tries to show how superior to his stupid audience. The editing is poor--too many grammar and typographical errors, words left out."
1,you get only one!,"They do not tell you that all you get is ONE handkerchief! That is you payf $4.00 + $6.99 shipping and handling. $10.99 for one handkerchief. Need I say more? Yes, it is a lovely handkerchief though."
5,A great read,James Dean: A biography is one of the most compelling biography's to date on the mysterious man that was James Dean. It is very clear that Mr. Howlett knows what he is talking about and is ver researched in the field. Unlike many books out now on dean his sexuality did not come into play often in the book. A must have for a Dean fan wishing to be more in touce with there dead legend.
1,WALES IS NOT IN ENGLAND!!,"Can we get this straight? Wales is in the UK NOT ENGLAND! So thanks to the reviewer who changed my nationality! Hmmmmmmmm......a very, very dated film which hardly does justice to the community it attempts to portray. Filled with cliche after cliche....none of the actors could conjure a Welsh accent between them. If you can forgive the appalling cod-Irish (well it's not Welsh!) accents, the failure to account for a language and culture in decline (Welsh) what you have left is a very boring tale which will entertain only by virtue of it's dated, non-PC antiquity. So says a Welsh-speaking Welshman!"
4,HIstory for an Eight Year old Grandson,"Purchased DVD ""How Green Was My Valley"" for our 8 year old grandson to go in his Wales Folder. Hope he will learn about the Welsh people and their histosry of over 2000 years. Maybe he will hum some of the great songs and hymns of these Celtic people. - DFS"
5,HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY VIDEO,LOVE THE OLDIES! ANY TIME I FIND ONE I WANT I JUST GO TO AMAZON AND THERE IT IS AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND I RECEIVE IT WITHIN A FEW DAYS.. I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE HOME AND SEARCH ALL OVER FOR IT. WHO COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE! LOVE IT!
5,Fabulous Old Movie.,I watched this as a small boy in the days of black & white TV and fell in love with it and have loved it for over 50 years.
3,Oops!,"I'm afraid this is a bit of a howler, but after reading this book, which I thought fine, I searched J.D. Morley's name on the web and discovered that he's the one who wrote the Memoirs of a Geisha review in the Sunday NYTimes several years ago that I still remember! It was a real howler. He didn't seem to understand that the translator's note at the beginning of the novel was PART of the novel, and in various ways completely missed the point of the book in a way that few people have. Now that I've read Pix from the Water Trade, I suspect it was a matter of jealousy, which is really kind of sad. So what do I think of this book? Adequate; not bad, really. But the author will probably be remembered best for his ungenerous and in fact rather boneheaded review of a much better book that will survive the ages."
2,too big,"I thought this item was too big...I returned it and bought a small diaper stacker. It looked like an eye sore in the bedroom.I had it hanging on the back of the bedroom door and I often shut the door when baby naps and you cannot shut the door w/ this on the door. It is probably helpfull for some, but not for me."
4,Wow! A great book,"Man, if you want to make it, and it's got honey or bee's wax in it, then this is your book. Adhesives, candles, metal casting, wine, lotions, soap, ... you name it, this book has it. It even has one of the best process descriptions for making honey wine (mead) that I've ever seen, better even than those given by the ""experts"". This book is a gem."
1,"Bottom 10 of all time ..Stupid ,poorly done ,Bad acting","I kept watching thinking it had to get better,it didn't. Its not Johnny Yuma was a rebel who wandered through the West."
5,One of my favorite all time Armstrong recordings,"A French reissue recording of notable and vibrant performances. The tunes leap off of the CD most energetically, from song #1, ""Georgia BO BO"" to the last. All round great musicianship, and the remastering is pretty well done. In my opinion anyway. Louis was something special and important. This recording gets you to feel that."
2,Limited duration,"This pen refill sadly runs out of ink all too quickly--especially given its price. I like the pen, but use it rarely now because of the limited ink supply."
3,The reason to get it.......,"I'll admit .....I got this one just for the Bob Seger hit ""Sock It To Me Santa"".The quality of that tune though, leaves much to be desired.This is because it is from an inferior source.Later the owner of the original tapes released this tune an many more, newly remastered.So,all in all, not a bad collection if you get it for cheap."
3,mixed bag,"Assembly was actually fun, using the special screwdriver they give you, and not difficult, but once assembled the pieces of the ramparts snap off easily. The small pieces in the set -- and there are many of them -- are easily lost, and a week later we couldn't find half of them. (Granted this toy was for a 5-year-old, so he may be a bit young for it.) There are many holes on the ""building"" part of it where you are apparently supposed to snap something on but nothing in the set actually goes there -- are they for add-on sets? It does leave me feeling like I only bought half a toy. My son likes to play most with the people and the little boat, and the building part is pretty much ignored."
4,Easy piano on the ears,I have several Danny Wright albums...they are all very good. I prefer his albums of 'standards' and he has a few. The recording quality is always very good.
1,BRADFORD'S CROSSWORD SOLVER'S DICTIONARY,"I ordered this because of some stellar reviews. I was very greatly disappointed. It is of little help, frustrating, and a total waste of money. Don't even accept one for FREE!!!If you look up a word, the clues are listed in alphabetic order, regardless of length of the word (and the number of letters is not given - you must count them mentally. Most of the responses given (once you locate words of the right length - don't really help even to get a general idea of some answers.Get a Roget's Thesarus, it's much more helpful!! (If I could, I would give it 0 stars.)"
3,Fun... but,"We followed directions to the letter which is important, and had a fun group of people who dressed up and really got into character. The problem for us was that in the end, we were no closer to discovering who did it than at the beginning. We learned a lot about each character, but the clues did not get you any closer to who killed the Duke. It was fun, everyone had a good time, but the game needs work."
1,Not Compatible w/ Vista,"The present spec on Amazon stating this product is compatible w/ Vista. NOT! I just received mine. The package reads"" Software supportWindows 98/98SE/MEWindows 2000Windows XP""I couldn't install this Bluetooth USB Dongle driver software.I urge Amazon to correct and update the spec by removing ""Vista compatibility"" from this product."
4,Works fine,"It worked great. I plugged in to Pc, paired my cell phone, now i can transfer files.This adapter came with no driver/software, but they're not needed. I found instructions for file transfer online"
3,Coo,"nice black see thru case, cool blue led, its plug & play for xp & linux! the range could be a little better though"
4,Good Read,"These lectures are really dense, alot to think about. I really enjoy his perspective on the human psyche and the many levels of the higher being. Enlightening look at the function of sleeping and dreaming."
4,Great But !,It works great. I do love it. But to charge it or sink it to have to take it apart because the bottom opening is to small.
2,Caution,"This product is one of the latest reported to help male problems. For me, it caused nightmares/odd dreams. It could be that it doesn't mix well with another supplement that I'm using."
5,"True, as always!","Like the last years, Rocky Sung's predictions have been as true as possible in the first months of this year. If the year to come is a bad one for some signs (including mine) so be it. On the other hand he predicts very good years for others! Anyway, I think it's way more better to be aware & prepared, than to be badly surprised by bad luck. I'm really curious what he has to say about 2003 - I guess it just can be better than 2001 & 2002!"
4,"Nice for organization, but could be longer","We have this organizer hanging over the closet door in our baby's room. The pockets are sturdy and it is nice to have some extra created space for storing items. It would be even better if the pockets started a bit lower from the top of the door to make the top pockets more accessible. It also would be nice if it were longer, or if it was possible to hook two together to go all the way down the door."
3,Mrs. Dull is a legend,"I was fortunate to find a first edition of Mrs. Dull's cookbook at a flea market in Clayton, Georgia many years ago. I have used it so many times I can't count them and still enjoy just thumbing through for a ""visit"" with this delightful lady. I can remember reading her column in the Atlanta Constitution and still laugh at a recipe I remember for potato salad. It began by explaining how to make mayonnaise from scratch! I suppose Duke's was not on the shelves then! I love the new one just as well, and considering how old my original is, I imagine this new one will outlast my granddaughters!"
5,Very good guide for shells of North America,"This is a great guide for shells of the North American coasts! A lot of descriptions, full with pictures everywhere. The pictures are not photos, but are wonderfully ilustrated by full color drawings, perfect and beautiful. ""How to Use This Book"" is a very helpful section, and then all there is to know about molusks is explained, topic by topic. Following, is an extensive and descriptive list of the different shells to be found in North American Coast, ordered in groups. You will find the explanation of each group, as an introduction to each.This book is a must-have!"
2,Very difficult to read,Very disappointing. Type is small and grey in color. Difficult to read in bright light and impossible to decipher in shadow.Highlighted paragraphs with darker background are even more difficult to read.
5,Indispensable Guide to Ethiopia,"I am planning my third trip to Ethiopia, and Philip Briggs' 4th edition of Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide has proved to be indispensable. I have used his previous guidebook editions on my trips, and his information and tips are always exactly right. As an extra added bonus, he is an entertaining and perceptive writer, and the books are fun to read as well. This is the only book a traveler needs for a trip to Ethiopia."
1,Pointless and Disappointing,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD - Here is the movie in a nutshell; three employees leave a Christmas party at the office and stop off at an ATM. While they're getting money out of the machine, a stranger shows up and traps them inside the atm booth. Everyone dies inside the ATM except one guy who is framed for the murder of his friends and the real bad guy slips away into the night.And who is the bad guy? Good question; he is some random guy who lives in a storage shed and has detailed maps of all the ATMs in the area. We never see his face, we never know why he did it... there is absolutely no reasons or clue given as to why all this happened in the movie, so your left to draw your own conclusions about a movie that was actually rather pointless and disappointing.Do yourself a favor, when you go the the ATM to take out money; don't use that hard earned cash to buy or rent this movie... it is not worth a nickle."
3,"Surprisingly, not awful!","Despite how bad this could have been, it was an interesting concept and had a few ""edge of your seat"" moments."
2,Thank Goodness For FF,"I probably would have rated a 1 star if not for the fast forward button. I probably ff'd through about 30 min of the movie. It could have been half way decent had it not been for the ridiculousness. Why did they park so far at 2a.m. in 5 degree weather? Why didn't the bad guy try the front door? Why didn't they just run? They two-timed a good guy, so why not 3-time the bad guy? Then to add insult to injury....we never got an explanation of why the guy was stalking them. Oh well....I guess just watching how stupid 3 people can be is a little entertaining...at least 2 stars worth."
5,CONCERTI PER VARI STRUMENTI,"In this CD the Ensemble Zefiro offer the listener an excellent selection of Vivaldi's concertos. From the exciting Trumpet Concerto, to the works for Bassoon and Oboe, to the Concerto for 2 horns. This CD is a ""must have"" for lovers of Vivaldi, or of Baroque music in general. There is a wide contrast of styles that keep the listener interested throughout. This was my first opportunity to hear the Zefiro Ensemble and I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for other examples of their work. I trust other readers will enjoy this CD as much as I have."
3,HUGO is correct!,"I have this CD and I had both The Original Caste's and Coven's versions of ""One Tin Soldier"" on 45 rpm record. Coven's version got the bulk of the airplay back in the day, but The Original Caste version is all I hear on local oldies (I live near the Canadian border) and on XM Radio's '70s station. All selections on this CD are the original versions. It gets only 3 stars from me for having only about 30 minutes of music."
4,It's (mostly) all about Dominique,"You wouldn't think it, but ""Dominique"" is a rare beast on CD. At least such was the case when I bought this CD (under its original title, Where Are They Now?) about ten years ago. You must give props to a simple acoustic number performed by a French-speaking nun that manages to keep a hands-down classic like ""Louie Louie"" out of the #1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100. Consider the climate: it was the winter of 1963, and the nation was still reeling from JFK. (Of course, the charts---and the country--would get shaken up in a revolutionary way a few months down the road.) All in all, it's a song that makes me feel good, and it's in good company on this disc. Sure, ""Monster Mash"" and ""One Tin Soldier"" figure in several anthologies, but for the price, this collection is tough to ignore.Oh, wait! I didn't even mention ""Jungle Fever""..."
2,Need sizing info,I don't understand the sizing. I need to order a 10.5 but don't understand all the choices example:! 10.5 2 AUS etc.What do all the letters and numbers mean after the shoe size
3,Classic chick flick,"This is the classic hollywood boy gets girl flick, we have all seen it a hundred times before, i gave it three stars because the acting was very good. This is way under Jack Nicholsons ability. I mean he should not be in such staid movies. When I see his name attached to a flick i expect alot. Over all it was an entertaining little flick and none of the actors have to get worried that they are going to be nominated for an oscar for any of their roles."
2,Not what I expected,"The previews portrayed this to be an upbeat romantic comedy. I found it extremely slow moving and found parts of the character's lives to not be believable. I love Reese Witherspoon so it was great to see her in a recent movie, but that's about it. I think they could have done a better job developing the whole ""indictment"" thing and it definitely could have been funnier. All in all very slow moving and you aren't missing anything by not seeing it."
1,Aweful Experience,"The movie seemed stolen from the theatre using cheap recording equipment. The DVD started buffering and jumping and flickering from the start. I'm too depressed to do anything about it right now additionally, I trusted Amazon so I threw my receipt away. I'm be more careful the next time. Let the buyer Beware!!!"
2,Mixed Opinion,"Disappointing, considering the acting talent. I'd say the plot was the stinker. Of the greatest value was Mr. Nicholson's performance. The hardest thing to account for was why would an athlete with so much going for her (played by Witherspoon) connect with anyone as shallow (and stupid) as the male athlete lead. Too implausible. And we should think the other male has a chance? He's such a weird looser. Looser gets some backbone with his father, but that doesn't seem to have much of any impact on his relationship with Withersppon. Seems like it's a movie of how to choose between losers."
2,Best way to define it is--A FLOP.,"It's hard to believe that the same guy, James Brooks, who has had such a fine career as a writer came up with this script and movie. The actors didn't have much to work with here, the dialogue is horrible. Half the time the characters stare into space thinking about what to say. The audience is often left to guess what the character is feeling. When two of the characters apparently fall in love you would never know it because they don't act like they care much about each other. Strange little film that totally wasted the talent."
3,Where's the Chemistry?,"I am a HUGE REESE Witherspoon fan but this movie was really disappointing. It drug on and on and there was no chemistry between any of the love interests. I love Reese and still think she did a good job, but there was a lot they could have cut out of that movie to move the pace along."
1,Film that goes nowhere,"Perhaps the title for this film is more of a reaction of people watching it. The movie starts, the story line goes no where, and at the end of the movie, I couldn't believe I had wasted that much time for a movie I didn't find entertaining."
3,Ehhh,"Not good, not bad. With this kind of cast, I'd expect a LOT more. It was an ""Ehhh"" movie. Nothing to be excited about. Glad I saw it but it's ok if I don't watch it again."
5,A blend of Celtic seas and Indian lands.,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to this album. The music has a very peaceful and soothing affect. If you want calm background music while working away diligently, this is the album to get."
3,Not as advertised,"Although this CD has some nice christmas oldies, it did not have several of the songs listed on the jacket. There is no Patti Labelle, Jerry Butler or Baby Washington on the recording. Instead, these selections (6 in all) have been replaced by various Motown selections, mostly mediocre, by the Jackson 5, Diana Ross and the Temptations. Whatever the reason, the cover needs to be corrected. If that's not what you're expecting, fine. My main reason for purchasing the CD was to get those very old gems. Otherwise, the CD's sound quality is fine and the selections are as listed."
2,Maybe he should stick to his knitting,"Kaffe did wonders for the knitting world, teaching knitters how to ""paint"" with yarns. In fact, the Kaffe Fassett sweater I knitted my husband has to be the peak of my knitting ""career.""Glorious Patchwork was a fun book, but as a knitter AND quilter, I feel that Kaffe's quilting is just a regurgitation of his knitting designs. Jinny Beyer has already done for the quilting world what Kaffe did for knitters.No new ideas here."
3,CRY BLOOD APACHE,Unlike that other review where the reviewer was looking for a certain star and was disappointed because that star wasnt in it so he blames the whole picture! STUPID REVIEW! This picture is not too bd. It has an interesting concept.Joel is in it only as a cameo. His son Jody is the real star
1,Gunfighters Stories,"I have had great luck with Amazon products but this is not even the sale price. The movies are ancient and very poorly done. I bought them for Joel McCrea and he was in ONE for about two minutes. Don't buy it!!!Amazon, I am sorry but I am being honest here."
5,Really enjoyed hearing how Roshi came to be where she is,"This is a very small book (45 pgs) that's well worth the read. A printed version of a speech given as a Wit Lecture at Harvard Divinity School, in which she recounts how her path took her to be where she is now (Upaya in Santa Fe). I learned a lot about Roshi that I did not know before. Since women are rare as Teachers in Western Buddhism, it behooves us all to pay attention when they tell us how they got there."
2,Okay if it is the only phone in the house,"I got one for my desk. The first time I was talking and someone picked up another extension, the sound started chopping out and it and was almost un-intelligible. The phone does not use an AC charger or batteries, but is powered from the phone line.When another phone on the same line is picked up, the available power drops and the phone tries to shut off. It is a basic design feature. If you have any other telephones or devices plugged in to the same phone line, this phone will stop working while the other phone is off hook. That makes it unusable.Also, the Caller ID phone number is displayed without hyphens separating the groups of 3 and 4 numbers. Hard to read.I paid shipping to get it, shipping to return it, plus a re-stocking charge. Wasted $30."
4,"Reflections, Humorous and Human","Mr. Laurie Lee reaches back in time and rekindles days of youth and growth where the paths of myth and reality cross and leave impressions of equally lasting impact. He paints his home and land such that one can recall the visit to the Cotswolds region although the trip has occurred only in the pages of Lee's little book. I am not a traveler of the region, my limited visit to England centering on London and the immediate vicinity. However, I feel I know the place, and the author describes people and events in quaint, coarse, refined, exagerrated, and convincingly worldly anecdotes. A resident of the Cotswolds has told me that Cider With Rosie not only brought his homeland to worldwide attention, but describes it in a way that no other author has matched. I can only say it is a rich and wonderful collection of life."
1,Disappointing Junk,"I thought this would be fun for my kids to play with, but it was such a huge disappointment. The voices all sound pretty much the same all the time. It is also extremely hard to understand anything that is spoken into this. Definitely save your money."
3,Couldnt get all 8 voices but its good for kids,you know kids.. the novelty wears off quickly -- its says 8 voices but I could only do 5... we played with the options..Other than that -its pretty sturdy and an OK purchase..
3,Voice Changer,Not much difference between voices...Not as good as an old Fisher Price from my daughter's childhood which I was replacing.
4,VERY GOOD QUALITY,"I really like this voice changer. I got it for my son, who has also enjoyed it. It is of very good quality. It provides an opportunity to speak in numerous voices. It is easy to hold without it being too small / large or slipping. It works without batteries, something all parents will appreciate. There are a few voice changers that look to be of slightly higher quality that are sold for lots more. The less expensive options did not appear to be good enough. So, while I wish the price were a lot less, this offers better quality, I think. Its an enjoyable toy, but, I don't think that children will play with it as long as I did with empty boxes. I rate it a solid ""B"" and it comes recommended."
1,DOA,"This product was dead on arrival. THought it might be the battery so I replaced it with a fresh one. Didn;t work. Just to make sure, I tried a second brand new battery ... NOTHING. My son is very dissapointed because he saw it and wanted to play with it. Unless I hear back from the seller on this proving this is a one time fluke, you can pretty much count my rating for this as ""CRAP""."
4,"Cheap and simple, but rather good fun","For the price, this is a great toy. It's fun for both adults and children. It's not especially well built or durable, so expect that it will die at some point in the future. For the price though it's a lot of good fun. Works well used in parallel to movie watching, try a Darth Vader effect? Ewoks? ..."
4,Megaphone,I purchased this for my 6 year old grand-daughter. She loves it. Her mother hates it. Over all a great choice.
1,gift for two grandkids,I haven't gotten any feedback yet as it was a CChristmas present but I tried it out before mailing it and was dissappointed.
4,Lots of Fun,I bought this as a Christmas present for my 7-year-old nephew and he loved it. He had a lot of fun changing his voice and he still plays with it...one year later. Nice toy and inexpensive.
2,Buy the smaller one,"I guess i wasted my money on this one,should buy only the smaller ones,because don't make all the voices as described.Disaponted."
5,great item,"my god child loved this multi voice changer ty great fun.fun.fun,for all the kids thank you n God bless you"
2,Worked for a short while,Bought this for grandson for Christmas. He used it once and with all the Christmas chaos going on we told him to turn it off. When he went to use it again it didn't work. We raced the 9 volt battery and it still didn't work. Am going to return it. Darn!
1,Fragile - and no volume control.,"I was hoping at first it just needed new batteries, but no. Although it looked okay, it was only clicking and not changing any voice on any settings. At first I thought this a shame until I notice that it did not have a volume control, so just as well the thing is broken, really. Saved me from quite a torment - but poor child it was meant to be a gift for on Christmas morning, eh?"
2,So-so,The kids like it but the first button is broken but it would cost more to send it back then it was worth so I just kept it. but the girls play with it so it's ok
4,My daughter and her friends love this thing - but it is loud!,"This is one of those toys that kids love but parents hate. I finally had to banish ours to outdoor use only! It is loud, the voice changing is hilarious, and the kids love it! We've had ours for 2+ years and it still works great! In fact, I don't think we've ever changed the batteries! Very fun...just wear earplus! :)"
2,A mediocre toy,"This just doesn't work all that well. You have to talk pretty loudly into the microphone to make it work at all, but when you do your voice drowns out the ""changed"" voice coming out of the tinny sounding speaker on the other end. And it may have a lot of switches to play with, but no matter how many different settings you try it just doesn't sound all that different. My five-year-old son who loves everything electronic played with this for a few minutes and then forgot all about it. It also takes a 9-volt battery, which is inconvenient when almost every other toy takes AA. I wouldn't buy it."
3,Fun and funky,"Works as advertised and is a lot of fun. The switches on the side don't give a huge variety - most of the settings sound the same with a few exceptions. Also, it's loud enough for indoor use, but for outdoors when you raise your voice for greater volume, it seems that the real voice can sometimes be louder than the amplified voice."
1,Hmmmmm,"Not what I expected. But then again, the price should have indicated that to me. Bought it for a Halloween prank. all the sounds seem the same...."
3,Not that great...,I did not think this particular toy was that exciting or that much fun...I would not give it a high recommendation... I would rather have my money back...
5,Everything my daughter hoped it would be...,"This toy is a blast for kids. It really does change your voice, and I think the different voices are distinguishable. My daughter asked for this toy for a long time before I actually bought it. She's played with it almost nonstop since.This would be a great gift for a beloved nephew or niece who lives in another state, and whose parents you don't especially like. Because the child will absolutely adore the toy, and it will make the parents want to gouge their own ears out with a grapefruit spoon. I made the mistake of buying it for my own child, who lives in the same house as me. Does Amazon sell grapefruit spoons?"
5,Centerpiece for basic figure 8 layout,"Works as advertised. No problems so far, no derailings. If you want to build basic figure 8 layout, you'll need one of these, one curved 18"" radius power/rerailer piece, and 21 18"" radius curved pieces of track (each loop consists of 11 18"" radius pieces of track). Once you get bored with figure 8, try experimenting what else you can build with it. Have fun :-)"
3,A short summary of the French/British war against Russia.,"Barbary's book is a nice quick summary of the war in the Crimea.The book is approximately 150 pages long, so the author gives a quick review of the battles including the Charge of the Light Brigade, and a review of Florence Nightingale. The perspective is British, so don't expect to get a great viewpoint from the Russians or French. One chapter deals with the experiences of Tolstoy in this war.Barbary treats the Charge of the Light Brigade in a different light than some other authors. The General commanding the charge is praised as brave, while the fault is all laid at the feet of the Commander in Chief. In the references, the author lists The Reasons Why book as an authority, but Barbary lays the blame on the Commander in Chief for this self destructive action.I list this as an average read of the Crimean War. The book is interesting and short. Those needing further details need to look elsewhere."
5,Men can learn a lot from this book,"While Bags to Riches is targeted to women, men will find benefit in its pages as well.On a nuts-and-bolts level Linda's book is one of the most practical books I've read. Each of the 18 chapters contain action steps that are approachable and allow a budding entrepreneur to get started...creating forward momentum.On a concept level I found myself having greater insight into the mindset of the women whom I do business with. Throughout the book Linda has Success Secrets which highlight the natural beneficial traits of women in business. For a man it's like having access into a ""women only"" chat room. It is said that men and women are different, but once you're conscious of those differences a synergy occurs. This book will help any man recognize and understand those differences.Thank you Linda for a great contribution!"
5,Sergeant Sharpe and India in 1803.,"The Indian Mahratta Confederation is doing everything it can to drive the British from India, including hiring European officers to train and command its forces on the battlefield. Against them stands General Sir Arthur Wellesley and his forces, a mixture of English Redcoats, Scottish Highlanders and native troops. Richard Sharpe is sent into the storm to hunt down a britter English officer who has joined the forces of the Confederation. Toss in the colorful language, the vivid details of army live, the politics and the twirling chaos of combat and the result is a bloody story of adventure and greed (for gold and rank). Great stuff!"
1,Cuisinart is clearly coasting on their brand reputation,"When I first bought this toaster a couple years ago, I remember reading that if it requires warranty service, not only do you have to pay return postage but you also have to pay a ""handling fee"". I thought that was outrageous and set the instructions aside, intending to write a letter to Cuisinart to protest this. Never got around to it, not that they would probably care.It didn't fail under warranty, but less than 2 years afer purchase it's practically dead and I'll never buy another Cuisinart product again. The left side stopped working after about 18 months, and the right side heats very unevenly. Even before it started falling apart, it toasted unevenly. What a piece of junk, and what nerve Cuisinart has with their warranty policy!"
1,"Horrible Toaster, Especially for the Money","I am currently perusing Amazon for a toaster. I noticed the reviews for this toaster and had to put in my two cents. I bought this toaster over a year ago at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. It has toasted unevenly (one side of the toast darker, while the other side hardly done) from the beginning. Since I do not use it every day, I have put up with this ever since. However, it has now progressed to not toasting the same on the identical setting. This requires adjusting it each time I toast the same bread type, as well as having to flip the bread around to get an even toast. Although, there were several negative reviews about it when I purchased it, I wrote them off as negligible (big mistake) because they were in the minority. However, it now appears from recent reviews that I should have abided by them. Cuisinart has not corrected the problems with this toaster. Given the price for this baby, it is a bad investment. It looks cool, but functions badly."
2,Bread Burner,"Should have sent this back when I had the chance. Looks pretty,lots of controls, BUT toasts very unevenly in all slots. You can even see the difference in the redness of the heating elements. Have the heating controls turned way down and it still burns in places and is pale in others. Don't buy it, look elsewhere. Finally contacted Cuisinart. They said ship toaster to them and send them $7 for them to ship it back. Could have went out for toast for a year for the money tied up with this. Go to Walmart."
2,"Not so Great, actually.","I am a fan of Scandinavian metal generally, and I purchased this album after hearing the song ""Silence Tells More.""That song is fantastic. The rest of the album, less so. I wish I had just bought the mp3 of that one song."
5,Ultimate rasta travelogue!,"Part of what I like to call the ""Holy Trinity"" of reggae-flavored films--the other two being ""Harder They Come"" and ""Countryman"", ""Rockers"" is one of those rare movies where style over substance is a moot point--it's still a classic! The storyline is almost mythic in its simplicity and universal themes; but you ultimately don't care because your senses are too busy soaking in the infectious energy of the performers, the sumptuous tropical colors, and a perfect marriage of visual movement and insistent reggae beats. The subtitles are helpful but not really required in order to enjoy the experience. The only other film I can think of to compare this to is 1959's ""Black Orpheus"", which had a similar power to immerse you in another culture with its heady combination of music, color and movement. Warning-I guarantee you'll break traffic laws to rush right out and immeadiately purchase the incredible soundtrack album (which thankfully is in print and fairly easy to track down)!"
2,Very uncomfortable,These shoes are very cute but the circle on the top cuts into your foot - ouch. After wearing them for a couple hours I actually sent my back for a refund.
5,Most versatile and comfortable shoes,"If you've ever owned a pair of Rockport shoes, you'll know what I mean when your hear comfort and light. These shoes can be dressed up or down and are so comfortable. These are similar to Rockport's Avian shoe (about 2 years ago) style. If you're on your feet all day and need a shoe that can be dressed up with slacks or down with jeans -- look no further."
5,Naruto,I purchased this at a nice low price Naruto Both seasons 1 and 2 DVD's for $ 55 with shipping and handling.They have excellent picture color and sound quality. it was shipped out fast and I got them at warp speed.I love it and would buy from this company again
4,Nice alternative to Verizon's $30 charger,"We bought 3 new VX8550 phones when we switched our cell carrier service to Verizon, but I was not about to shell out $90 for three car chargers. These work quite well. They are not as solid feeling as the ones in the Verizon store, but thay are LG branded, so I hope that means they'll be good and not ruin our batteries. So far, so good. The order arrived quickly, with good email communication from the seller."
1,Worse purchase ever,"Not for heavy ""leakers"". Get saturated in 2 min. I was surprised first couple times founding my bra completely wet, thought my baby peed on me during the feeding. Also leaking in front of other people and getting stained sweater is unexpected embarrassing surprise."
2,Disappointment for a new mom,"I purchased this item based on Avent being associated with high quality products. That is not the case with these pads. They are not very absorbant, especially for nighttime use, are too bulky to wear under anything but an extra large sweatshirt, and worst of all they stick to your nipples, increasing dryness, cracking and bleeding. It is a wonderful idea being able to reuse them, but not a workable one. I recently tried Johnson's disposables that are extremely absorbant and the pad and leakage do not stick!"
1,what a waist of money,I know we need something to keep our shirts and bra's dry but there is a better way..I cut not thin but not ultra maxi pads into 4 pieces..DON'T TAKE THE TAPE OFF until ready to use..Then just peel off tape when needed and put em in your bra..you are gonna stock up on pads anyway!
4,My favorite,"I purchased a couple different kinds of reusable nursing pads because I just couldn't bring myself to constantly line my bras with disposables which, to me, seem like jamming pantyliners into your bra. I like these the best because:1. They maintain their shape after washing. No strange edges/shapes after being in the dryer.2. Thickness - I found that the thin pads did nothing to contain my leaking. These pads absorbed well - even when I was soaking through everything else!As others have mentioned, you may see these through your shirt. But, I think that's the case with most pads if you REALLY need them. I have a heavy milk supply, and these have worked best for me."
2,"not absorbent, not contoured at all","I bought these because they are more environmentally friendly than disposables however they do not absorb much so I always end up changing my shirt because it leaks through. I don't consider myself a heavy-let-downer at all (ie. the disposables never got saturated) so I was very disappointed. They are also very flat. A little contour would be nice, and make more sense because really, who's breasts are totally flat? The only thing I like about these is that they seem to wash well and come with a mesh bag, which is convenient."
3,Ok but a bit pricey,"I just bought these and have been using them for a few weeks. They work well for moderate leakage--too light and they stick, too heavy and they leak. This is comparable to other washable pads I've used, however. I like the lace--it does help prevent slipping. They pads show a bit more through tight clothing (like a nursing tank) but not terrible like bulkier pads. All in all, I prefer the Nuk washable ones simply because they are less expensive and do not show quite as much."
2,Not Effective,"I guess these are for between feedings. While my son is nursing one side ,the other side is completely soaked and it looks as if i have no pad at all. These really did not help me and are a waste of money and time. buy the disposable kind or even better , use sanitary napkins with leak guard. At least they have sticky backs to keep them in place."
1,not absorbent enough,I still leak with these. They aren't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy. Basically I only use them when I'm desperate.
1,Don't waste your money!!,This is a total waste of money. It does not absolve any milk. I definitely would return it if I had not thrown the package away.
5,One of the best novels I've read in years,"The Cuban-born Latour writes better in his second language of English than most other writers for whom English is their first and only tongue. This suspenseful, spellbinding novel is set in Havana in the Fall of 1958, when the Yankees-Braves World Series was under way, and centers around the planning and attempted execution of a heist of money from the safe of a casino run by Meyer Lansky. Lansky and other real-life mobsters are characters, as are various hoodlums and police officials. The Revolution is brewing as well, of course. This is an intelligent, flawlessly written work that comes along only too rarely. Buy it and savor it."
4,Pre Castro Cuba,Havana World Series is a good yarn set in Cuba during the gangester days before Castro. This is one of several books by Latour that tell quite a bit about the disasterous political conditions that existed before and after the Cuban revolution. This and his other books are not overtly political and concentrate on just telling a good story. Read and enjoy!
1,It is just the workbook!,I expected to get the book but got the workbook. You really have to look closely at the picture to see that it is only a workbook.
1,Bad edition,"The flow of this edition is poor as the text is broken poorly. You will find full lines followed by a brief partial phrase, followed by a full line, followed by a brief partial phrase, etc., etc.In my opinion it is a shame a great piece of literature is presented in such a way. I would not pay the .99 cents over again."
1,In serious need of updating.,"I should have paid more attention to the copyright date: this text is too old to be of much use to anybody. Computer technology changes quickly and this book was written in the late 90's. For example if you already use Windows XP, there is some built-in VPN capability which you could use for free; but this is not even mentioned due to the age of the book. I wish the ""For Dummies"" people would produce an updated book on this subject."
1,Awful,This book contains basically no information - instead it's just a very very long definition of what a VPN is. If I could give it less than one star I would.
3,"An Funny, Goofy Comedy.","A Mentally Challenge Man (Damon Wayans) with a Knack of Making Something New with Virious Gadgets of Junk, who is Trying to Change the City of Chicago, who wants to Put-Down the Violence from Street Gangs and Another Crimes. He decide to Built Himself a Crime Fighting Costumes with Weapons of his Own, with the Help of his Older, Wiser Reporter Brother (David Alan Grier) and the Younger Brother becomes a Superhero!Directed by Mike Binder (Indian Summer) made a goofy light comedy thanks to Damon Wayans-(TV's My Wife and Kids) Dumb Enjoyable Performabce as the Title Role. Robin Givens (Boomerang) plays the Reporter, who has affections of Wayans. The Film was a Box Office Flop in Theaters but Is more Enjoy on Video than it Did in Theaters. It's a Not-Bad Superhero Spoof Suffers from Too Much Language for Kids and Not enough Laughs for Adults. The Film may be Forgotten but It's Still Enjoyable One. Grade:B."
3,Good but not best.,These CDs have good tracks -- but I like his previous Christmas albums better. The other albums are my favorites!
1,Krylon BBQ and stove paint.,"I painted my Ashley sheetmetal parlor(woodburner)stove with this black paint, followed the instructions, burned logs in the stove outside before reinstalling it a year and a half ago, and every time I heat my house since painting the stove, it smells like burning paint, and it's peeling off where the metal is hottest. The smell is still severe after hundreds of fires, and I'm concerned that the only resolution may be to chemically remove the paint and use something else. It says ""ideal for wood burning stoves"" on the can. I disagree."
5,Very Happy,"I bought this bedding set for my sons Cosco portable crib. It made very well and washes nicely. It is so cute. My son and I love the animals on the bumpers, he likes to make noises at them. If you have a portable crib I recommend buying this bedding set."
5,"MOVE OVER EMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!........THE ""NEW"" KING HAS ARRIVED!!!!!!!!!!",What can I say?.......WOW! WHAT A PLAYER!!!!!!! This guy is serious!!!!!!!! I LOVED every minute of this Dvd!!! Adrian is the Man! A MUST for any Viking or NFL fan!!!!!!!
5,HIM goes to its roots,"This album is similar to Greatest Love Songs. vol 666 because they both have a ""dark"" sort of feeling to it. It starts off with a bang witht he 1st track ""Buried alive by Love""The bell just rang...It kicks"
1,Love Metal Hate Him [EXPORT ASAP],"This band is absolute trash! Some of the worst music I've ever heard. I love the CKY videos but Bam should have stuck with just CKY for the soundtracks or better yet have Brandon DiCamillo make up more songs. H.I.M. must stand for Horrible Idiotic Music because it sounds like the worst noise imaginable. Imagine a dump truck backing up at 7am with the ""beep beep beep"" noise topped off with dragging a metal dumpster along the asphalt, just grinding away what's left of your ears and giving you a headache. That's what HIM sounds like.Wake up kiddies and teeny boppers, just because you love Bam Margera doesn't mean you have to love his favorite band too! THINK FOR YOURSELF! This music is HORRIBLE! Notice how Raab, Rake, Bran and the rest of the crew never sport HIM attire? Can you actually call yourself a fan after watching what a tool the lead singer is? He looks like more of a flamer than Siegfried & Roy, only not as tan. Excuse me while I go puke..."
2,Wrong color,"They sent a light lavender -- not really a color I can put on either of my two boys. That's a bother, because otherwise these seem pretty good."
1,Shrunk,"They fit my son well when we first got them. We washed them when they got dirty, in cool water with like colors. They shrunk so much they no longer fit him. They do not stretch enough to fit his hands anymore."
5,Excellent reference,"This book is a valuable book. It contains the gnostic gospels with the original languages and spanish. It is a critic edition, so many useful commentaries are found in this book."
4,Nice but too light,"It's sharp and looks nice but feels really light, not what I expected from a steak knife. Not dishwasher safe, it get's rust spots."
2,Rust from dishwasher,"I like the knifes; however, they are not meant to be put in the dishwasher as they get rust spots all over them. I would have never purchased if I knew they were not dishwasher safe."
5,A Serious Call For Real Manhood,"Society has exalted a view of man that is not only destroying only men but their wives, their children and their communities as well. Mr. Cole hits the very center of the issue and he does not fear in doing so. Being a real man is being like Jesus Christ. I was surprised to see that the book was first published in 1982 and that I only got to read a copy only now after 18 years. Yet I have never been so impacted by a book so much that it moves me to change. I am a Bible believing Christian and yet I would place this book immediately after the Bible as a practical manual on how to live daily as a real God-fearing man. It sets Biblical principles against the current ideas and lifestyles of men and addresses each issue clearly to allow the reader to have a better if not the best option to be renewed and revitalized. It's not a new book, but the truths explained in it are timeless and powerful."
3,weak collection,"I've picked up the last few years worth of the Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards, and usually I'm not disappointed, but this year I was. I've read most of volumes Dark has edited, and usually I agree with him on most if not all the stories, but I found this year's selection to be different. There are some good stories in the volume, but most of the stories are mediocre, dull, or just plain bad. But one bad volume doesn't spoil it for me. I still eagerly wait for next year's selection."
5,Great movie!,"I bought this movie since I remember watching it many years ago.Was not sure if my son (guitarist) would be inspired, but he was and in fact....watched the movie everyday the first two weeks of owning it."
4,An over-looked gem!!,"Crossroads is one of those movies that at the time wasn't a hit but over time, people have rediscovered it and it's become sort of a cult classic. When you think of Ralph Macchio as a blues guitar slinger it seems like a blatant miss-cast but how he plays the main character is actually what gives the movie its charm. Not to mention the fact that the devil's main guitar slinger is played by a young and relatively unknown guitar player by the name of Steve Vai!! And the swagger was there back in the day. Anyways, the soundtrack is great and Ry Cooder really captures the feeling of the movie overall and there's some great slide work. The picture quality is good and the sound quality is clean. Keep in mind that this was made in the 80's but it's a definite improvement over VHS. Crossroads is definitely one to add to your collection"
1,never received,"Don't know if this was a good movie or not because I have yet to receive this DVD. I have sent the seller several e-mails, but no one has responded. I purchased it on July 18, 2008, and the estimated arrival date was Aug. 8, 2008. I paid for this DVD with my paypal account so I know they have already gotten my money. Needless to say, I'm not at all happy with the seller at this time.Some info would be greatly appreciated!!!!Thanks in advance,Amy"
5,Crazy Old Man,"Cheesey, cheesey, greasey, sleazeygirl meets boy, and boy is she easy,Mud duck harp dog, telecaster karate chops,devil demands his duescaddy rides, guitar slides, Steve Vaievil eye, down home good timewhiskey sippin' blues!"
4,Crossroads (1986),"Fun little ghost story. Great sound track. A little pedestrian for the 21st century, but I remember it new in '86. Can you really not like a movie with a Steve Vai cameo?Ordered a used copy and got it in great shape, and in four days, two weeks before Christmas."
4,Good movie,"This movie is an instant classic, it's a little different but the story is a good one. Following the journey of a young man and the man he looks up to and is trying to understand."
1,Worse Than Paper and Pencil,Whatever you do... do not purchase this machine. You are spending [money] on a doorstop that gets less work done than paper and pencil. I have to say that this is absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made. The computer has a desktop processor which overheats and thus causes it to shut down unexpectedly. Even better is the fact that Toshiba released a patch which throttles the cpu to lower than 50%. So basically you are paying for a laptop that runs at 500 mhz and shuts down on you periodically. Toshiba will not refund your money and will only tell you to send it into their service depot for which they do not have a fix.
4,Not for structural analysis,"This book is very good and refreshingly different from the other ones, but only if 1)you are interested in electromagnetic and other applications of FEA and 2)Are comfortable with variational formulations."
3,"Good unit, lousy customer support","While I am generally pleased with this GPS, nowhere in the instructions or on the web site, does it describe the uses of the SD card slot on the Nuvi200. 30-40 min. wait times on the phone for a person to talk to: unacceptable. 2-day lag for answering email from tech support, then the 2 sentence answer didn't answer my questions. Still don't know, for example whether I can buy an SD card and download European maps- or whether Garmin sells SD cards loaded with European maps for the Nuvi200."
4,GPS Review,"I was surpised at how easy it is to use the Garmin. It proved its worth last weekwhen we had a lot of traveling from one location to another on Long Island N.Y. and there were Nor'Easters on two days so we could not see the exit signs. The Garmin made it very easy to know when we coming up to the exist and especially when to stay to the left or right lanes.Ocasionally it would get confused and give us invalid directions. Yesterday when traveling from my house to my cousin's house in Eastern Mass., at distance of 31 miles, the GPS could not get the satellite and thought that we were still in the Bronx, N.Y."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it!","This product is easy to use, accurate, and really quite fun! It has saved me MANY times in the DC Metro area and beyond. It does everything I would ever need it to do!"
2,Took me in the wrong direction!,"After reading all the postive reviews, I purchased this model since I just wanted a basic GPS. I recently moved to Florida and needed one to help me get around a new area. After using it a few times down here the GPS has sent me in the wrong direction every time! For example, it will tell me to take a left for .6 miles and then it will tell me to make a u-turn and go back in the same direction I came from for .6 miles. Then it took me North on the FL Turnpike only to tell me to take the next exit and head South. It made me late for my first day of work. I don't know if I just have bad luck and got a unit with old maps, but I'm definitely returning this."
4,Nice,"At the time when I purchased the Nuvi200 had already returned a Mio and two Megellans looking for a decent GPS unit. The Nuvi200 is a keeper. My only problem with this and most difficult to understand is WHY WHY WHY they couldn't have taken the extra step and make a allowances for categories. I guess they think that your entire database of special stops and personal points of interest can all be shoved into one category called - Favorites. I'm amazed to find that the only one making allowances for this was one called a Mio that you couldn't hardly see or hear and was the reason for taking it back or I would still have it, even over this Nuvi200, it even had better maps. The Mio was only $179 and you would think for twice that price Garmin could have made allowance in design for extra custom categories that users could make. They have this thing where custom POI can be developed and inserted but this not what I'm talking about."
1,PREPARE to PAY $69 more any time,"Just talked to their customer service, they DON'T give free map upgrade to any previous purchase even within 1 day old. They just guarantee new maps when purchased, so be prepared to pay $69 for a map upgrade anytime. It should be zero star for that reason. If you are living in a fast road changing areas, this is a junk after 1 year."
1,Hello Garmin Customer Service?,"I would NOT recommend this product. I bought a garmin nuvi 200, and it was great for the 1st year. It is now conveniently out of warranty, has a firmware error, and Garmin's customer service is the most inconvenient and unfriendly that I have seen of any company. Their contact us page should read in bold ""we do not care about your problems""."
2,Works fine; just don't ever update the maps!,"It *should* be a great product, but the problem is that it comes with old maps. Wouldn't normally be a big deal, but new roads get built over time, so they direct you to update the maps (free!). That is where the problem begins.The update software is not intended for the 200. It is designed for units with more horsepower. And it doesn't work. It completely screwed up my unit, and judging from the complaints on Google, everyone elses too.Their C/S queue is about 200 calls waiting at any one time, so plan on spending a half hour waiting on hold. There is no way to revert to the old software. It is a nightmare!Grr!"
4,"Cheap, simple, perfect buy!","This is one of the simplest models from Garmin but nevertheless does the job well. I bought this needing a cheap but reliable GPS. Every once in a while, the accuracy is only slightly off. I have missed a few turns that way, but seeing that I bought this one for about $40, that does not bother me in the least. It happens so seldom anyway. The interface is simple. It does not say street names, which to me is not important anyway. I think that for the price, you simply can't go better."
4,NIce GPS but the Maps are a bit outdated,"Overall, its a good GPS with prompt indications for directions, but the maps are a bit outdated and updating the maps thru garmin is as costly as buying a new GPS. It also hangs up inside parking lots and takes a lot of time to recover even after coming out resulting in unnecessary detours and wrong directions if you need immediate guidance..."
4,Good Value,"Pretty good value, and versatile too.Pro's include:-Car, bicycle and pedestrian modes-Offroad mode, good for hiking or 4X4 trails-Address or coordinates for those of us who venture off the paved roads-Very small, big screen-Easy to useNegatives:-Does not say street names-Have found some small roads not in the system - way out of town-Occasionally it gets confused in tight city streets...recalculates often because it thinks you got off track"
4,So easy its scary,"This unit is easy to use, with a large easy to read and ""punch"" interface. Turned it on and was ready to go out of the box. I don't leave it in the car, I prefer taking it with me when I leave the car for work or home, and its easy taking it with me back and forth.I drive around Orange County and the only problem I've run into are toll highways, I have to avoid those even when the GPS doesn't. But it recalculates when I need it too, very quickly. It doesn't say street names but I haven't found that necessary, I just read the screen for the street name if I need to. Very happy, just what I wanted!"
3,"It's nice..,","It's nice for our first GPS. It is easy to use and set up BUT it has old information on it. For instance, a street in my town has been changed to another name but it's been at least 7 years (it's a pretty big street) that goes through several other towns in this part of Texas and on the GPS maps, it still lists it under the old name. Other than that, it's nice. The screen is very nice, you can view pictures on it and I know there are ways to get it updated but it would have gotten 5 stars had the information been more current."
3,Garmin has better options,"I bought this unit and returned it after a week. My husband has an older model from Garmin and one of the features I love about it is that it tells me what street to turn on. Instead of saying ""turn right in .5 miles"" - it says ""turn right in .5 miles on North Road"". This newer model however - does not give you the street names. You have to read the screen to see what the street is - and since this unit is so small - good for portability - I found myself squinting at the screen.I have since purchased the Nuvi 350 instead.Pros:Tiny & PortableEasy to ProgramCons:No directions by street nameRecommendation:Spend $30 more and get the 350 instead."
1,Illegal and terrible directions,"WARNING: Using this for navigation could be very dangerous!!! I just got this and after testing it to plan 2 routes over roads I know very well, I found I cannot trust the routes it chooses. The first one told me to make an illegal left turn in front of 3 lanes of traffic. The next one took me through terrible city traffic over a much longer distance, rather than use the Interstate. It also labeled an Interstate with the wrong number. Yes, I had it configured properly, and downloaded updated software as of Oct 16, 2008. So, the only use for this is as a tiny (possibly inaccurate) map or for GPS coordinates, speed, and elapsed time."
3,blast from the past,"I probably got this Nuvi 6 or 7 years ago...... yeah it was cool back then, but I can't say it any more. Its most practical function is to stay on all the time."
3,Accurate but sometimes takes you on a longer route,"I bought this for my husband who says this works and is accurate but it doesn't always send you down the fastest route. Because of this, he prefers using an old fashioned map where he can take highways that have less traffic, etc."
3,Pretty good deal,"I got the GPS device as in the described condition. It was a pretty handy thing for me, as I am new to driving in the US.It did bail me out several times when I got lost."
3,BUYER BEWARE: MEXICO MAPS VERY VERY SPARSE,"We just received this GPS. We ordered this specific GPS because it has maps of Mexico. HOWEVER . . . While a fine GPS that seems to function just as it should, and this GPS does indeed have what GPS maps for Mexico are available -- BUYER BEWARE! . . . Garmin's maps of Mexico are SPARSE. We'll be staying on the Riviera Maya in a touristy town listed in every guidebook -- it's not even ON the GPS map! We were hoping to take the with us so that we could day-trip and explore -- not going to be possible this way!So, just know what you're buying. We thought we did. Oh well."
4,good for newbies,"this product works well for most general uses. but sometimes when moving slowly through bridges (that overlap other streets) or streets that are very close together, garmin gets confused and keeps switching between conflicting instructions. also, sometimes if you deviate from the suggested route to a parallel road, it can take a while to notice as it seems to assume you are still on it's suggested road. this can lead to making several annoying uturns. still for the most part, it gets you where you need to go, esp. if you are new to an area, and also acts as a good local map of the area you are driving in."
5,Very nice shirt for all occaisions.,"Has silky smooth finish, just right elasticity, easy to keep clean, washes easily and doesn't shrink."
3,"Fun to play, and then you're done.","This game is very fun to play - you get attached to the little people, and the challenges are fun to figure out. Unfortunately, once you solve it, it is really boring to play again. You know exactly what and when to do everything. If you like to play games and replay games, this isn't a good one to invest in."
4,Interesting and Entertaining,"I read the other reviews before puchasing this game. I actually found it to be quite entertaining. As stated by others this game is not full of thrills and high energy, however, it is fun for those of us who aren't interested in violence and guns, etc.And it isn't as easy as it might appear on the surface. The puzzles can be quite challenging to figure out and there were quite unexpected solutions.You can pause it if you are going to be away for a while, or you have the choice to select a ""time"" speed. Turning off the computer will still allow these villagers to go about their business. It is often a suprise when you turn it back on to see what is new.You can't just start up the game and let it do it's own thing. The Villagers need to be trained in their tasks. It is your choice as to what they learn.All in all, I have played this for quite a while, and found it to be quite relaxing."
3,Hmmm!,"I was searching for a ""chrome retractable clothesline"".I looked at many before deciding for this one because it stated first thing ""Durable chrome construction""I now see in the Product Features area that at the end it says ""Please Note: This product is a plastic with a chrome finish"" (something I don't remember seeing when I made my purchase, because I looked to make sure)In case you are wondering, because it is misleading: It is 100% plastic.I haven't installed it yet, but will. Seems like it will do the job, but I am worried about its durability.Maybe I am mistaken, but to me ""Chrome"" is a metal."
5,a brewers yeast that my dog LIKES the TASTE OF,"My dog was losing some hair on her back and over one eye. I had read online that this might help (but was skeptical since I wasn't sure what was causing the hair loss, and the dog is over 10 years old). She has been on it a week and already looks much better. She also LIKES THE TASTE which is huge! As a puppy I tried another brand and had to coat it in peanut butter to get her to eat it. This one she gobbles up as it is, and we call it a ""treat"" for her! I have also noticed that her appetite is better now."
5,After all the money I spent....................,"I found out these almost free pills gave my Miniature Schnauzer a beautiful coat. I started using these about 3 weeks ago and the dog's skin is clear. THIS after blood tests, mail order dog food, cortizone shots, food supplements, you name it. DANG!"
2,great treat but does it really work?,"One of my dogs certainly like this little tab. It has not, however, solve our flea problems.I have two terriers. One which has skin problems and I had hoped Brewers Yeast would help him out. Oddly, his tablet has to be mixed into his wet food.Flea control still has to be used. The bottle is still almost full. So I will continue to use it for their coats. But I would not recommend as flea control"
2,Made my dog really thirsty,I've only been giving my poodle mix (15 lbs.) these capsules for like two weeks now but I'm already considering stopping them. They haven't really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because he's been drinking too much water. On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night. I'm worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think I'm going to stop giving them to him. That's too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good. Although I did see some possitve changes in him it hasn't been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences. I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so I'm not sure this is such a good idea after all. Has anybody else experienced this?
4,1 out of 3 eat it,Well.. 1 out of 3 of my cats will eat these. When they first arrived 2 of them would eat them. We'v only had them for a little more then a week. The scratching on the one that eats them has ceased however he isn't the one with the skin allergies so I have to look for another product to try.. I did try several tricks to get them to eat them but they we're on to me and simply ate around the tabs.. O well..
3,good service,"This was good service and a fair price. No problems with the order. I didn't give a 5Star for one reason only - and this does not mean just this supplier - I checked them all.No one gives full label information in their description. Due to this, I was not sure what size tablets I was getting (strength). As it is, I guessed wrong. As I have a large dog (80 lbs.), I have to give him EIGHT of these a day now.But - I was glad to find them at all. My local pet supply has stopped carrying them. So, thank you."
1,dogs hate them!,"I'm pretty bummed because this ended up being a total waste for me, because my dogs both hate them. One of my dogs is a small 10 pounder, so sneaking a big pill like these past him is impossible without holding him down and shoving it down his throat."
1,Garlic causes Heinz Body Hemolytic Anemia in dogs and cats.,"Garlic has been proven to cause Heinz Body Hemolytic Anemia in dogs and cats. Garlic in any shape or form does this. There has been no fatal dose determined and no safe dose either. If some one tells you that a certain amount is safe, then they are lying because no amount has been determined as safe and each animal tolerates it differently. Even if your dog or cat doesn't succumb from garlic, it makes no sense to purposely inflict any amount of anemia on them.If you give your cat or dog garlic, you are putting your pet into unnecessary danger and playing with their life.There have been documented cases of even healthy, large dogs dying from a small, one time dose of garlic.There are far safer parasite preventatives than toxic garlic."
4,Aviation History,"This was a gift for a retired military vet, He seems to like it a lot but seems to disagree on some of the videos description of certain events."
4,Helpful memory jogger,"We are a couple of old fuds, and we have a dear friend with a 3 yr old who was coming to visit. It had been a LONG time since we had been around a 3 yr old. This book helped me remember what to expect from our little friend, and it made things a lot easier. I knew to not ask her to do things she wasn't capable of, understood a bit more of what was going on inside her pretty little head, and in general, enabled me to help her spend her time here having more fun and being in less trouble. A good read for anyone who is dealing with a 3."
3,Shoe is ok,"I was looking for a shoe I didn't have to tie for my toddler. I bought this one because it was velcro. I put it on my son and his foot bulged out of the top, even though it's the size he was measured for in the store. He wore them and as the day went on, the tongue on the shoe slipped down. It's a cute shoe, but just didn't fit my son the way I had hoped."
4,Almost a must have,Great textbook on Analog circuits. You will use this book as a reference again and again.
1,Embarrassingly corny,"I could hardly stand to watch this video because the instructor was so irritating and stupid. He would constantly yell things like ""I think about you all the time. I really care about you""-- a statement so ridiculous and ingenuine that it can't help but arouse scorn. His health advice at the end of the video gives you all sorts of ridiculous information like the fact that ice cream and heavy cream are loaded with fat-- DUH! The workout itself is also so easy and so boring that I felt like it was pointless. I never ever work out and have only recently decided that I might want to get in shape. I didn't even break a sweat or strain a tiny bit during this video even though I was doing things at a greater speed than was shown on the video-- the instructor was dripping with sweat. Don't buy this. You will regret it if you are bothered even remotely by irritating falseness and studied enthusiasm. You will find Richard Simmons more genuine. I swear."
2,Full of Errors. I'd pass,"I am an experienced programmer and I wanted to learn PHP, so I got this book. I use Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.2.17. Well, where to begin. Some (many) of the examples on the disk are unlike the ones in the book. Second, the author uses <?...?> to indicate the code that is PHP (to be processed by PHP). When I use that, nothing happens. I have to use <?php (as every refereence on line says). And thirdly some code just doesn't run at all and emits errors. For instance (and there are others), persistence.php: When I run it I get this:Notice: Undefined variable: txtBoxCounter in C:\usr\web\persistence.php on line 14Notice: Undefined variable: hdnCounter in C:\usr\web\persistence.php on line 15There are many more like it. Perhaps if the book were corrected it might be OK to get."
4,Good for PHP basics,"My son was looking for an introduction to web development, and I couldn't think of a better place than PHP with which to start.I found the author's writing style very enjoyable - and was particularly impressed by his choice of example programs. For instance, the chapter on databases introduces concepts using an adventure game!The only problem I had was the lightweight treatment of Content Management Systems (in particular the discussion of PHP-Nuke), which ended up being much too generic to be of use.However, that doesn't really detract from the quality of the rest of the book, which is highly recommended."
1,"Worthless, like all computer books for the absolute beginner","Totally asinine book. Apparently you cannot use php without dealing with a webserver. But if you know how to deal with a webserver, then how are you an absolute beginner when it comes to programming webpages? The cover of the book says ""NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED"". That is an absolute lie. If you are an absolute beginner when it comes to web programming, i.e., you were born before 1990, you'd be better off adding 1 cent to the $29.99 publisher's retail price of this book buying yourself 30 lottery tickets and using any money you win to pay a programmer to do what you hoped you could use this book to learn how to do. Risking your money with the lottery would give you a better chance of getting something accomplished than trying to make sense of this book would. I wanted to design a website with a presidential election game, but I think I'll stick with biology and history- things that I understand."
3,beware of rust,I like Kitchenaid products because I can get them in red. These knives cut just fine but started rusting the first time I washed them and I hand wash unlike the lady whose knives rusted in the dishwasher.
2,"White light, 55w is 55w","These lights were installed on a 2003 toyota corolla le.The corollas lights were poorly engineered in my opinion. So writing a review will automatically be tainted as the halogen bulbs cannot be fairly evaluated. They provided white light as advertised but could not really tell a differenfe in road brightness improvement. I also think for what you get (2bulbs) they are expensive. (16 dollars per bulb). Sorry, I was expecting an improved night time driving experience.I drive 51 miles to work beginning at 4:30am. So my drive is all at night. Deer, roads that wind and people who think they drive in Nascar, are the primary reason I tried these bulbs. Visibility. I wasnt impressed with the bulbs at all and was severely disappointed that the passenger bulb blew after just 1 year. I wore nitrile gloves when installing the bulbs too.I wont be purchasing anymore of these bulbs."
5,High Quality Bulbs,"In the past I have used other brands of (Extra Bright Headlights), these bulbs fit much better and the road visibility is excellent."
1,Be carefull!!,"Be carefull with ordering replacement auto bulbs. I followed the sites instructions for making sure the bulbs were right for my vehicle, got them, and then found they were the high beam bulbs not the low beam ones. Didn't see anyplace that asked me to specify which I needed. Now have to pay $7 plus to send them back. Sure the bulbs were fine, but the order process is flawed it seems. Will go to my local auto parts store from now on."
1,Don't buy these bulbs!,"I bought a set for my Honda Ridgeline. One failed within 4 months. I replaced it, and then the other one failed. I replaced that. Two months later, the first one failed again. Sylvania does state right on the package that silverStar bulbs don't last as long as regular bulbs, but this is ridiculous. Even worse, having headlights you can't count on could leave you in a dangerous position. I went back to my Honda dealer and replaced the SilverStar bulbs with Honda original equipment. Zero problems since..."
5,Sylvania 9005 SU SilverStar Ultra Halogen Headlight Bulb,Great product. Light is a lot whiter than my old ones and lights up everything in a wide range and 40-50 mts ahead.
3,Not sure which product to be disappointed in...,"I purchased an aftermarket headlight assembly for my 98 K1500 Silverado. It came with projectors with bulbs for the lows, which were very bright already. I purchased the Sylvania Cool Blues for highs... I found out that the highs were not as bright as the lows. So I decided to put buy these, Sylvania SilverStar Ultras. As the packaging shows, they are supposedly more than twice as bright as the Cool Blues. To my disappointment, I saw no difference doing a side by side comparison. So If you are considering these, I'm not going to really recommend them. Their life time is rated much shorter than their other products, but give no noticeable difference in brightness. Wish it wasn't the case though!"
3,9005 SU Model,"There Bright white with a sky blue at the end twist.But like i mentioned on the 9006 SU model. I got the same problem they say ""65"" watt, when opened the bulb says 60 watt. So there we go again, there goes my road power also :/ I'm stuck with brand new bulbs that dont give what the packaging and manufacturer says in (watts).9005SU and 9006SU Models. Damn :("
3,Sylvania SilverStar Ultra,Marginally brighter than standard headlamps - waiting to see if these burn out quickly as other reviewers warn.
2,TOO LATE,I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING BULBS FOR LOW BEAM BUT I GOT BULBS FOR HIGH BEAM I HAD PACKAGE FOR 7 MONTHS BEFORE I OPEN PACK TO INSTALL AN THAT IS WHEN I SAID THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T BUY LOCAL.......MY FAULT
3,You could spend your money elsewhere,"Did I say could? I meant SHOULD. Not to say this CD is bad, but it's nothing special. It might be worth the cost of a blank CD and the time it takes to burn it, but other than that.... To say they are knock-offs of Incubus is unfair. They DO sound like them, but that doesn't mean they are totally un-original. They're music is really good, but the lyrics are truly pathetic. I'm not sure if they were trying to sound deep and mysterious like Incubus, but the lyrics are really not good. Also, while the guitar is playing really rocking stuff, the words are sung to little pop melodies that sound more like Britney than Incubus. If they were trying to sound like Incubus, they suceeded, but only to an extent. There is no way any band could sound as good as Incubus, so there's no use in trying. I AM interested to see a second release from Hoobastank to see if they can improve on this decent-at-best first attempt."
1,Blah.,"I don't like this CD at all. The only 2 songs I can tolerate are ""Crawling in the Dark"" and ""Running Away"". I've made myself listen to this CD 5 times, maybe even more, and I've never gotten into it. Supposedly since I like Incubus, I'm required to like Hoobastank, but I don't. They just don't pump me up."
2,"Great sounding, but. . .","The CD sounds great! I took it into work and forced my co-workers to listen to it. Then about a month after buying it I actually thought about what the lyrics meant! Horrible, horrible! I was so embarrassed that I ever took it into work. This guy sings about taking advantage of girls. If you have no morals buy this CD, sounds great, but I don't like bands that have content like this one does."
2,Only 1 good song on the CD,"Like many others I bought this CD after hearing ""Crawling in the Dark"". It is the first song on the CD, and the quality definitely goes downhill quickly after that single song. ""Crawling in the Dark"" is the only really good song on the CD. There are 2 more decent songs and the rest are just crap. If you really like ""Crawling"" I recommend that you buy the CD single and hold off on paying full price for this CD unless you get to listen to it entirely somewhere. I know I am disappointed that I paid full price for what amounts to a 1-song CD."
1,Hoobastank,"Isn't one Incubus enough, if not one too many? I can't believe this band show their faces in public, knowing they ripped off another popular band. It's pretty sickening."
4,A good album but...,"I thought it was the new Incubus song when I hear their single. I then saw the video and still thought that it was Incubus. The lead singer looks and sounds just like Brandon. Not a band with total originality but still a good band none the less. There is talent. I actually got to see them live a few years ago and heard some old CD they put out. They still sounded like Incubus then too. They may sound like Incubus but at least they picked a good band to copy. They are a really good band though, don't get me wrong."
3,"Good, Regardless of Similarity","This album was one that I felt would be something quite special when I first picked it up. Somehow my hopes and dreams of a fantastic album that would fulfill all my need for incredible music fell short, but by no means does it mean that I dislike it; in fact, I have it in my car regularly and listen to it quite often, but despite all that, this album is a good one. There are a few songs which really grab me, making me feel as though this band is at the very top, but other than those three songs, the rest are all muddles together. I sometimes even forget which songs are which. The songs to look for on this album are Crawling in the Dark, Running Away, and To Be With You. The first two are just solid songs that deserve the hype that they recieved, while the last one is a song that is very different from the rest on the album and I liked that. So overall, this album is good, I could live without it, but I'd rather not, which must mean something. A wothwhile buy for sure."
4,A great debut...a little too much Incubus,"Hoobastank can write great songs and they have a strong vocalist in Douglas Robb. Overall, it is a really strong album.The only negative about the band is that Doug's vocals sound A LOT like Brandon from Incubus. They sound so much alike that when I heard Crawling in the Dark, I thought it was Incubus for a minute. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because I think Brandon has an incredible voice, but for a band on their major label debut, they need to establish more of their own style. I don't think it helps the comparison that they recently opened for Incubus.Ironically, I like this album more than Incubus' Morning View.I think the potential is there and hopefully they will find their own niche. A definite buy though if you like Incubus at all."
1,"we have a name that stands out, so we don't have to","Rarity? Well if by rarity you mean the bands name I guess I'll agree, but you really don't have to dig very deep to understand that this sad excuse for an album is just a rehash of all the other mainstram nu-metal robots already playing. Incubus, Deftones, Linkin Park are all bands that I, an intellegent muic fan would never be able to tell apart, and now Hoobastink have joined the ranks. The lyrics are trite (just look at the song names) and all pretty much about the same thing- pain of some sort; well guess what, your rock stars on a major record label who don't know what it is like to struggle on a club scene, cheer up. Basically what Im saying is, this album will not grow old with you, you will through it away when the next band and the next fad roll along. Indie rock forever."
4,rock ?,"where are the guitar solos ? great songs, but all these ""alternative"" bands are just hard rock/heavy metal bands without the guitar solos. why won`t anyone play a solo ?anyhow, this is a great rock n roll cd. great musicians,great songs and a cool logo.the only problem i have with the cd is it seems a little underproduced. the band at times sounds amatuerish at best and at worst they sound like the band extreme of ""more than words"" fame."
4,Useful,"The civil rights movement was pivotal in our history, this should not have to be stated. However, most students learn about it only in passing, as the history curriculum in schools still tends to end just after WWII. Even treating this through picture books is better than that.This book, featuring a young girl whose socially active brother and sister participated in the sit-ins, signed people up to vote, and got arrested for their troubles, takes a good look at the Greensboro sit-ins. I like how the main character acts like a real child - she's proud of her siblings, yes, but she also wants them to stop protesting and stay home and be safe. She's eight years old, and, given the wordiness of the book, that's probably about the right age for the reader.The artwork is pretty enough, but it would have been better on a larger book. When sitting with a kid in your lap reading with the light dim for bedtime, they end up looking a bit muddled."
2,for completists only,"True, theres a bunch of stuff here that wasn't included on the Peel Slowly boxed set, but...most of this isn't really anything to write home about. It's bottom-barrell leftover for the most part, but not without interest from a historical standpoint. If you've got everything else under their name and still want more, than buy it.I like ""Hey Mr. Rain"" and ""Real Good Time Together"" (which turned up on Lou's ""Street Hassle"" sounding radically different). ""Coney Island Steeplechase"" is a pretty cool song too."
4,small but good,"The train is small but very fun, with lots of switchers on the track to run various routes. Each individual train car is roughly 2-1/4"" long and about 2/3"" wide (just wide enough to accommodate a AAA battery in the engine cars). We are enjoying it and think it will hold up pretty well for the $39 spent. the elevated train area is fun as is the working drawbridge and the various ""scenic areas."" It was pretty easy to assemble as well. It does lack the creativity of track-building that Thomas, etc. allow. But, overall, this is a great next-stage train after Thomas (once kids want to run automated cars) and a great value for the money."
2,Boo,"This album was pretty plain unlike ""songs of praise"" and some of thier greatest hits albums. A lot of the songs started out with the same intro just changed around a tiny bit and none of the songs besides love sucks stood out. It was totally different than songs of praise, in a bad way. Way less english, it seems like monkey is losing his accent. lost thier goofy upbeat punk style. Almost all of the songs are too repetitive, saying the same lyrics overrr and overrr. ""Rockers in Rags"" and ""Love Sucks"" are the most decent songs relating to thier roots. Go buy ""Songs of Praise"" first and get into them, then maybe buy this later on if you get bored. Or even buy a best hits album first sheesh. just not this one."
1,Not worth the money,"I second the other reviewer's opinion. I bought this before seeing that review. The graphics are weak and outdated, and where I had expected a library of images I could just copy and paste, you have to go through their software to insert images into documents that you produce using Cosmi's software. If the images were high res or visually compelling, I might be willing to fool with it, but they're not. The stock photos that come with MS Office (I don't know if they're available in all versions) are far superior, even if the selection is modest. Better to have one great photo than many low res uncompelling images."
3,Only made runny crap worse,Maybe it was the wrong diagnosis for my kitty. I changed his food and he is fine. I ama sure the product is fine. It wasn't for my kats problem
3,well...,"This book isn't as good as other BSCs but it's still okay!reallY!!Dawn is sure her house is haunted and ,guess what?, she discovers a secret passage!"
4,Great book and suspenseful,"I read this book many years ago when I was about Dawn's age. Dawn is one of my favorite characters, and this book is one of the best in the whole series. It is suspenseful, and if you like haunted house stories in general/or mystery novels, you will like this one. If you like this book, you will probably like Claudia and the Phantom Phone Calls, as it is also very suspenseful and has an unexpected ending. Those two books will get you into reading mysteries and thrillers if you aren't already. I still have the book, which is being saved for my own kids to read someday."
1,A New Age Album of War Songs by John Phillip Sousa on Steroids!,"Before you start bashing and gnashing your teeth and cursing, I will state for the record there are several albums of ELP that I enjoy and with the desire to discover something new I purchased this overly loud, one dimensional piece of martial music dreck. I read the rapturous reviews and think these must be the same sort of people who would applaud with standing ovations and rave about half hour drum solo's back in the 60's. Anything is wonderful if it's extremely loud and done pretentiously. . .I'm not faulting their musicianship, only their lack of ideas and subtlety. In fairness, there were several songs that were almost listenable and enjoyable but I don't want to go back and listen to this bombastic album again to determine precisely which songs they were. It's simply not worth the effort. If this is a sterling example of art rock no wonder art rock, notwithstanding the continued survival of Yes, is deceased."
3,Game Looks great on the PS3,"...but it lags extremely badly, and that includes taking 3GB of your HDD for ""improved performance and load times"". Also, even on the easiest difficulty, some parts of this game are absurdly challenging. Many people label this game as crapware, but I think overall if you are a big fan of Gundam, and are a good gamer, this game might be something you could get something out of."
4,Decent,"I am a Gundam fan, ive watched the shows and love the games, my favorite being federation vs. zeon. I would reccomend this game to mostly just a gundam fan because this particular title doesnt offer much to bring in someone to the band wagon. Overall the graphics are very nice, attention to detail is the best so far for the gundam series, however there is a framerate problem. At times it can seems like the framerate gets choppy, but it clears up really quickly. Gundam vs. Zeta had it even worse when it came to frame rate. As for replay value its definately there, i dont see why other gamer sites rated it so low, i actually enjoyed getting more pilots under my command, and buying more and more gundams to serve in my army. Great game."
4,Highly recommended,"Very interesting read for any Beatles fan. It was believable because it showed the Beatles in both positive and negative aspects rather than being biased one way or the other. I just wish there was more detailed information about the post-Beatles years. But then again, this is a Beatles book not an Ex-Beatles book. Overall, it was a very entertaining read. Grab it if you can find it."
2,A loveless take.,"This book is thick with opinion.the author clearly has a very negative perspective, the book is full of obvious misinformation.bitter and two dimensional."
3,Average soundtrack with a hidden Michael Hutchence gem.,"This soundtrack isn't all that bad, but then again it is basically forgettable. The one major point of interest that I'd like to point out though is to fans of INXS and the late Michael Hutchence. Though the amazon tracklisting does not credit a performer, the song ""Spill the Wine"" (originally by Eric Burdon & War) is performed by Michael Hutchence, the late lead singer of INXS. This track is not available anywhere else. I recommend it if you are an INXS completist. If INXS doesn't interest you, you might just want to skip this otherwise mediocre collection of songs."
5,"CURRENTLY, THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD",I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN WORDS. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE SONGS. TO ME HYBRID THEORY HAS A SPECIAL FEELING THAT DRAWS YOU IN TO IT AND WON'T LET GO.
4,A CD with only a few good tracks,"First off I'd like to say that Linkin Park is not metal, not nu-metal not thrash metal, definatly not heavy metal. Not that I'm putting Linkin Park down, but they aren't metal, They're just more of the offspring from that Rap/Rock hybrid music that has become so popular.Now to the CD; Hybrid Theory is a decent start to a band that will either make it big or fall flat on their faces. My favorite tracks are Papercut, One Step Closer, Crawlin, Runaway and In the End. The thing about these songs is that they aren't just good but they are great, they won't play out too fast, meaning that you can listen to them over and over before you get sick of it.The downside is that the other tracks aren't good, but the CD is worth buying just becasue of those 5 songs mentioned above."
5,Sheer Musical Genius!,"I just recently bought this CD after a recommendation from a friend and I can't explain how incredible this album is! It pulled me in with it's professional, yet original sound, combining rock, alternative, hip-hop, and electronic. To any music fan out there, this album is a must-have! I personally am not a big fan of heavy music, but LP definately has swayed my opinion with this CD. This is an absolute masterpiece!"
3,Not bad... shows promise,"Not a bad CD all in all. Some of the songs tend to be formulaic, mellow verse followed by hard guitars and a screaming lead vocalist - Crawling and In the End are proof positive that a hook can sell records. After listening to the record quite a bit I decided that there were 3 songs I really liked that broke from this mold. #2, #7 and #12. The lead singer really does have a good voice but doesn't showcase it except on one track - not sure what's up with that - listen to #12 and you know what I mean. The 'rapping' half of the group has solid lyrics but a monotone delivery that doesn't really do anything but waste time during the verse to make the chorus seem more powerful. I do like how the 2 leads play off each other on some of the tracks, which is what makes this group good in the first place. A focus on better delivery by the rapper and less screaming, more singing by the other lead, and you'll have a 5 star album."
2,nothing special...,"it seems like these guys have had their incredible success from being the right band with the right song at the right time. the album wasnt selling so hot until the summer, when they were on tour, and In the End was just coming out. the album is nothing spectacular. you can get the same kind of recycled rap/heavy rock [stuff] in just about any other band today. everyone owns this album, and i just dont see anything special with it. that guy that sings is so annoying. he doenst have that great of a voice, and has developed an annoying scream/sing... if you want something special with true musicianship, try something esle."
1,not good...,"I love rap music, rock music and electronica; however this is a pathetic attempt at blending the three. The singing is weak, rapping embarrassingly bad and the musicianship incredibly average. only thing that saves this album is the production and even that can't hide lack of talent. I have heard people saying that linkin park are first 'manufactured' metal band; really wouldn't be surprising if that was true. This is quite simply shallow pop music: if you want metal listen to bands like tool, pantera etc if you want rap listen to the Roots or Wu Tang or something if you want kinda ambient electronica that LP so desperately try to recreate, listen to Aphex Twin or Boards of Canada. You'll then see how redundant this ... is. Avoid."
5,Need a good Heavy hitting cd to listen to?,"My god, I don't think I've ever liked a Cd so much. I havn't listened to every song yet, but don't think I'll find a song I dislike. There's a couple different styles, and with two singers, you can't get much better. If you've read the other reviews and saw the rap/rock bit, it's not. Metal, or a Heavier rock would fit best. I'd highly suggest getting this cd, or get an mp3 of the following to test out; One Step Closer, Crawling, Runaway, or With you. You'll definitly like Linkin Park."
1,ughh,Linkin Park is just a rock version of the many manufactured boy bands there are out there. The songs are average and dull. It's all a scam. Don't buy into it.
3,Rap-rock fusion,"I'm not really into rap metal, but this could be a good exception, because Linkin Park has many elements that makes them stand out of the rest nu-metal groups.Personally, I think that they can do much better, for example, Mike Shinoda isn't really necessary and makes the group win a Pop reputation, lowering the standarts of this pack of musicians.The album is a good start for people that are not much used to rock music."
4,They just can't win,"On this site all I see are reviews of the band and how much they stink; hardly any reviews on the actual album. Did anyone even listen to this album? Well, I did. This album is great, just check out any released single. How fickle can the public get: when you don't sell any records, you're criticized, but when you go double-platinum, you're hated even more."
5,Who could ask for a better cd than this?,"This CD is so great, words can not describe it! If you love hard rock with a bit of alternitive, tons of music, and meaningful lyrics, this is one great CD for you. I remember how I used to be a pop junkie, trying to get my hands on any and every BSB cd out there. I was watching MTV and One Step Closer came on. I couldn't believe it. I was hooked after that. After I got Hybrid Theory, it was like a revalation. I couldn't believe it, this was real music. Raw talent. No Nsync memeber could do that. It was unbelievable. I never put it on stop. I listned to it every chance I could get. A few of my favorite tracks are Papercut, In The End, Crawling, Points of Authority, and Runaway. I loved everything though. Nothing could ever compare to this CD. If anything was better than this, I would die in shock. Pop music doesn't even come close. Never have I seen such talent, such passion, and such MUSIC! Sorry, BSB, but you don't stand a chance."
5,Straight Up 5 Stars - NO LESS,"This is rap/metal/hardcore @ it's best. This CD has helped me through some of the most difficult times of my life. Hard-hitting, edgy without one obscenity, Linkin Park hits the proverbial nail on the head. Generation X'ers everyhwere: This is our Anthem CD."
3,?,"The Cd is mixed and recorded very well. The lack of the so called lead singer, Chester, is what the cd is missing. The little guy with the funny hair running around saying ""i'm about to break"" makes me want to turn it off. Chester needs to sing more on the next album. Oh, and those two bonus tracks are not unreleased for all the numbskulls that think there going to be on the new album. Thanks for the time"
5,Rock hard Music Fan,I love this cd with a passion! Linkin Park shows how rock is these days without all of the cussing that many other groups feel they have to use. Linkin Park is an awesome group who has always been able to pull through times of no music with great cds and always leave us waiting for more. I think this cd is fabulous and everyone that I have told to listen to this cd has never regretted it. I suggest everyone buy this cd or at least listen to it before you make judgments about the band.
5,THE NO. 1 ALBUM IN H-I-S-T-O-R-Y,"HYBRID THEORY was released actober 2000, and now i'm writing this review on tuesday march 15 2005....u know why i'm wirting it now??, cause untill this moment i'm still listening to that album, LINKIN PARK - HYBRID THEORY.no matter what u F!@#S say about LP and how they suck you just missing something extremely important...u F!@#$%S don't like the rap/rock genre....then why the F!@K do u come here and write a review??!!, this reviews are made so as customers could see what linkin park's all about, but when u motherF!@#$%S come her and say bad SH!@#Y stuff about LP then you're doin it wrong punks...LINKIN PARK are the best band alive, i mean...listen to CRAWLING for God's sake, or IN THE END, PAPERCUT and PUSHING ME AWAY.they're classics that will never fade out...LP is our history,so whether u like them or not...cope with it."
4,a sick cd,"This new linkin park cd rulez, it is sort of a good mix between korn, limp bizkit, and blink 182. It is a totally good cd, i mean, who else can take, punk metal, and pop rock, mix it up, and come out with a good sound...linkin park. later"
2,Fred Durst is so cool!,"I couldn't believe my ears listening to this CD!! Fred Durst is awesome!! He puts the rock back in ""rox my sox!"" And like he's Paris Hilton's boyfriend so that makes him automatically cool, because only the best go out with her!!!Oh wait, what's that you say? Fred Durst didn't record this CD? Oh well then it sucks. 2 stars."
1,The Most Overrated Band's Most Overrated CD,"Linkin Park have no talent whatsoever. Their lead singer cannot sing. Compare him to other metal vocalists like Dani Filth and Rob Flynn. Their other vocalist who raps has no talent either. Their drummer just sucks (everyone says he's really good, but he's not). All of their songs sound the same. Their is no variety in this CD at all. Instead of picking up this worthless piece of garbage, pick up a copy of Cradle of Filth's ""Damnation and A Day"" or Machinehead's ""The More Things Change..."" Leave this overrated piece of junk on the shelf."
2,THIS IS HARD ROCK?,"I dont know, maybe I'm just old school. But what do people see in this music? Its not hard rock at all. The lyrics to the songs are too soft,they are too cleancut. And the singer, whoever he is, has a terrible ""rock"" voice. I just think that this new generation has really missed out on good authentic hard rock music. To me, I know its just my opinion, Guns N Roses was a true hard rock band. (May they rest in peace) Nobody could match their energy or intensity ,certaintly not this lame band. All I have to say to youn LP fans, buy a copy of Appetite for Destruction and listen to it once and then tell me which band truly rocks. If you still think LP is better: then I give up."
1,WOW,"Are you an angsty teenager without a shred of original thought in your head? Of course you are! Well this is the CD for you.One star is much, much too generous for this release, but it's the lowest I can give."
1,Don't even bother...,"I purchased this CD hoping to hear some good music from an obviously over-rated group... of course, as expected, I was highly disappointed. The lead singer's screaming voice is enough to annoy anyone after a few songs, the sound of the band is nothing special, and it was just... boring. Every song sounded just about the same - if you flip through the tracks, you'll see what I mean. The lyrics are extremely unoriginal and dull, and frankly, I don't really care about hearing all their problems (that's all they sing about). Linkin Park is just another of those mass-produced group made to make money. Don't even bother buying their CDs. If you have to listen to something of theirs, download Points of Authority or something that's bearable... and if you've already bought the CD, I suggest chucking it into your swimming pool."
3,"Decent, with signs of talent.","If you like Limp Bizkit, there's a good chance you'll like this CD. If you like Papa Roach, you'll like some on the songs(Crawling, One Step Closer, some others), but the songs don't have as much meaning as Papa Roach's songs. If you don't like Limp bizkit, there's a good chance you won't like this. Most songs on the CD are just screaming. All the songs are set to great music, but one of the singers should just shut the hell up and let the singer from Crawling, and One Step Closer sings, because he is has a great vocal talent. A good debut, and if on the next Cd they stick to one singer, they will be great."
1,The most overrated album in the history of music,"Since it's release, I've probably heard this album all the way through well over 75 times -- involutarily. Never in my life did I ever think that an album could be this infectious.The album essentially has only one song. That's it. That's how original this band really is. It's terrible. There is absolutely no variation at all between any of the 12 tracks (notice I didn't say ""song""). You can skip around all you want and you'll hear the same stupid crap -- whiny lyrics, pathetic side rapping, some really crappy programming, dropped-""D"" tuning with guitar that sounds like it was played with only one finger. No soloing, no variation, no key changes (not even between songs), no time changes -- nothing at all. It's about as monotonous as Ben Stien's normal speaking voice from ""The Wonder Years.""Oh, well -- whatever sells 7+ million records. You give a bunch of little kids some guitars and percussion and look what happens."
5,Great First Album,"I do not usually say an album is perfect but this was a perfect album! I loved this and I still listen, years later. The first time I heard them was when the Crawling video came out. I was half sleep and heard the haunting music come on so I woke up to watch and when I got up the next morning I had to find out who was behind the music. I think these guys are gonna be around for a while so sit back, listen and enjoy!"
5,The best CD I have ever owned,"This CD is and will always be one of my favorites. What I've found with CD is that I can listen the WHOLE way through without having to skip every other track. Also, as several other people have pointed out, there is no cursing! Its nice to see a band express themselves without having to diss their momma or say the ""f"" word in every other sentence.Now this is hard for me to admit but I used to be a pop-head but after hearing ""Krawling"" on my local rock station (I live in South Florida so of course there is only one rock station and about fifty rap stations but that's a different story) and I feel in the love the group and immediately bought there album. The songs on this CD are powerful and anyone, I don't care who, can relate to at least one of them. For me songs like ""Papercut"", ""In The End"", ""Runaway"", and ""Krawling"" have things that I feel I can relate to. Now I know music is all a matter of opinion and my opinion is that Linkin Park is at the top of there game."
4,"GOOD CD, BUT NOT THE BEST","Despite the fact that this band's debut CD was nominated for 3 grammy awards, it really isn't a 5-star CD. If you enjoy rap, this is a CD you'll love to add to your collection. This is a CD of rap/metal fusion, and is still a good CD, not perfect. Puddle of Mudd's ""Come Clean"" is much better."
2,Way too overplayed and won't last very long,"This album shows what can happen when several radio stations and mtv gets a hold of your music. This was just an ok cd a while back. This cd is a poor bland of music. The whining screams and rapping do not go well together. On top of that, three of their songs were played almost nonstop on the radio. Yes, it does get very annoying. And that is what happened to this cd. This band most reminds me of Limb Bizkit. The new style of music attracts listeners and then they get overplayed and eventually just turn to rap. Or are never even thought of in 10 years. If you are a big fan of rap/ nu metal you might like this cd."
1,Thank-you Suzanne!!!!,For telling it like it is. I would just add that this band's whining makes me want to strangle them. All this a-tonal sing-songy nurshry-rhyme style frat-punk ruling alt-radio these days has got to go.Some little interesting electronica patter comes on and then the next moment that painfully familiar Linkin Log guitar drone comes in again and I wanna puke. I feel sorry for kids coming up today who think this is music.
1,Terrible music,"This album was by far one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I had high hopes, then when I couldn't even listen through the full CD without needing a break, I knew it was poor quality music. It sounds like Linkin Park tried to blend hip hop, rap, metal, rock, and electronics together in a style similar to that of Limp Bizkit. The high-pitched male vocals (when they're actually SUNG) grate on my ears, and the clashing music genres drag down the album the whole way through. This music seems to appeal mostly to angst-ridden teenagers who believe they've been through pain, when it's actually just what everyone goes through in their adolescence."
1,Weak,"I heard One Step Closer and i thought, hey, thats a pretty good song. So i got it. Then when i listened to the entire album, every track sounded like the same thing and all i have to say is weak."
1,hmmmm,"Not sure how bands like this one make it with just one good song on their CDs, and bands like Motorplant with their release of ""American Postcard"" still are undiscovered"
5,The best!,"I bought this CD because I saw that Linkin Park was on Vampire Radio, and I like Goth music. I would say it isn't really that Gothic, but I like it anyway!"
5,Hybrid theory,Ok I'm not a huge fan of linkin park I like about 16 of their songs and this is their best albulm. The best song on this albulm is In the end it is a really good song I would reccomend this to people who like nu-metal or Classic Linkin Park.
5,"Dig it, OF COURSE!","This is the beginning of the good stuff for this band. Be careful buying this one, it is catchy and difficult to stop listening to."
3,Better Than Fred But Not Great,"Like what the world really needs is another rap-rock group with a front man whining about everything from girls to people stepping on his toes. However, Linkin Park do provide a refreshing relief from the idiot wails of Fred Durst and the over-sappiness that Jonathon Davis seems to be leaning toward. The music is really not much different from anything that Bizkit does, but the difference is in the vocals. The double threat that fronts Linkin Park compliment each other very well, and the lyrics are on much higher level than Durst (which basically means that the f-word does appear fifty-thousand times in one song). But despite catchy tunes like ""Papercut,"" ""One Step Closer,"" and ""Crawling"" Linkin Park really doesn't break any new ground with Hybrid Theory. But hey, it's better than listening to an idiot yell about being able to say the f-word."
3,Eh.,"It's ok. But the only problem is there's no solos. This would be excellent if it had solos. But, alas, there is none. I have this bad feeling that this will be their only album. Oh well. they aren't spectacular. They have this cliche sound that makes me give it 3 stars. They sound too much like the other bands that are around now. I rather have true metal, like Iced Earth and Blind Guardian, in my stereo, but this is ok."
4,say what?,you guys that gave a one star to likin park heres my lil messesge to you get a job you bums.ok ok they may not be like the best metal band but give them some credit come on you losers. this time actully listens to them and you love it.why do you hate it man>?well this album is great and i have it hell yea man.
5,One of my top 10,"Okay, so MANY people have opinions. Mine is that this CD is great. They are pioneers in this field. I don't see how you can say that they re-hash or reinterepret anything. They are trend setters. I can listen to this straight through and love every minute of it. Buy this CD, you will like it. Their new one isn't bad, but not this good. ""Points of Authority"" and ""Place for my Head"" are great. If you like this CD too, check out ""Reanimation"", especially on DVD-audio (although you most likely DON'T have a DVD-A player)."
4,Hybrid theory be Linkin Park,"A very good album. I am really impressed with Linkin Park. This music may be what the future of music sounds like. Very dark and very emotional. Other than the fact that I picture these guys as a little nerdy, it is a very good cd. My favorite songs are crawling, cure for the itch, papercut, one step closer. Its a good cd to rock out to. The way they overdub guitars is very cool. I wouldn't rate metora as highly, but this one is very good. A mix of rap and pop and metal."
5,awsome album,this album was great awsome alternative/rock that 1 star review got this wrong with some other album but this was a great album. All their albums were great exept for minutes to midnight that album sucked but this album was awsome.
1,Do not let the title fool you,To put it nicely there is only one good song on this CD. I would recomend to perspective buyers to save your money and put it toward a better group like Greenday or Limpbizkit
1,The computer made me give it one star.......,"To say that this ""band"" doesn't even deserve one star is an understatement. It is quite sad what this country has come to. It is quite obvious that receiving a record contract does not require musicians anymore. I am appalled by the fact that anyone would call these incompetent fools musical geniuses. That is simply a crime to the world of music. I only reviewed this cd because I have a good laugh reading its other reviews. And to those of you who credit this ""band"" for thier mockery of a musical compostiton; you have a lot to learn."
1,A Sad Day In Metal,"First off: To anybody who even thinks for one second that Linkn Park is metal, well, your sorley mistaken. Hybrid Theory is a sick, a sad song. I hate it. The only song I'd buy it for is A Place For My Head. If you want a true metal album, check out Slayer - Diablous In Musica, Slipknot's first one, or Metallica - Kill 'Em All."
2,Boring,Dwhat? Boring. This cd is ok the first time you listen to it until you realize that you are being bored to sleep. It will make you say Dwhat?
3,"it wants to rock, but....","so, when i first bought this cd i popped it in my car disc player on the way home from the mall, and thought to myself, ""wow, this is pretty weak"".it doesn't have much low end thump or deep grooves, the lyrics are kinda juvenile trying to be emotional, it has some breaks in it with potential to rock, but then falls short. the biggest suprise of all came on the songs where there is more singing than rapping. dude, did they kidnap justin timberlake to come in and do vocals on this thing? it sounds like n'sync tried to do a hardcore record.i will give it to these guys tho. i listened to it a few more times, and some tunes did stick in my head. i guess i can also say, i haven't really heard much out there like this b4. if they stick to this style, there is no doubt they will sell records, but they will probably be regarded as the backstreet boys of the rap/rock genre."
5,The Best of Linkin' Park,Linkin' Park is a great band. And if you love Linkin' Park you should get this cd. It is the best of Linkin' Park.
5,amazing cd,"This cd is so increadible, everyone I know, teens and parents alike enjoy this album. Linkin park is original and amazing. This album, hybrid theory, is pure genious."
5,The Best NU METAL...,"I think, I don't promise too much, if I say that LINKIN PARK is the best NU METAL, RAP METAL etc.- BAND this time, forget LIMP BIZKIT, forget FREDDY DURST. It's time for the new and fresh princes of this genre. I don't hate LIMP BIZKIT, but since ROLLIN, I feel sick when I see FREDDY somewhere on MTV, they became a very childish band after a time. LP are much more mature, their lyrics are very good and they don't sing about cars, money and t(...)ts. Their (in my opinion) best song IN THE END, proves their real quality. Their sound reminds me of a mix of LIMP BIZKIT (sorry...), STABBING WESTWARD and MICHAEL JACKSON(!) what shows the very large musical background they were influenced from. They combine aggressive shouts (ONE STEP CLOSER, FORGOTTEN) with melodic passages (CRAWLING, IN THE END, PUSHING ME AWAY) in their innovative mix of (Nu)-Metal, HipHop, Grunge and 80's Pop. BUY THIS CD, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BOUGHT IT!!!"
2,Disillusionment.....,"I am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 because I'll admit for about a year after it came out I got some pleasure out of it...but that was before I realized what real music is. After I listened to more and more bands from the 70s,80s, and 90s, I found that bands like this don't measure up in musical quality. This band became too popular because its songs have hooks that an inexperienced ear from this generation will at first think is the best thing that ever came out. The bands that last 25 years, like Iron Maiden, have more substance to their songs."
4,"Not as good as Limp Bizkit or Korn, but very good metal.","Like most people these days, I find myself having a hard time finding a talented metal band. After realizing that the underground metal scence was full of greedy untalented crap like Morbid Angel, Testament, Iron Maiden, Amon Amarth, Nile, Suffocation, Death, Judas Priest, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom, and Cryptopsy. This Linkin Park band shows you that melody and heaviness can be combined in a brutal way."
4,"Good beginning, needs some work","I've been waiting a long time for the true synthesis of rap and metal to emerge (since Run DMC and Aerosmith did their little gig with ""Walk This Way"".) This album has an excellent driving sound and does a good job of mixing the rap dialog and its associated elements (scratching and big beat) with the raspy metal sound of the lead singer and guitar. Yes, the music is not always too complex and the lyrics are still a little juvenile, but compared to their contemporaries (Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock) it can seem at times like Shakespeare. Really the only thing that is glaringly in need of change are the times when the lead singer, Chester Bennington, goes into his Sam Kinison like, hyper-accelerated yelling, which are few and far between.Overall, this is a good album, but their second album ought to show whether they will choose to extend their talents into the unknown and make a new sound, or follow the dark path and become the glam band of the new millenium."

2,bath mat,"Doesn't really stay down around the corners. It is very long which is nice, but I'm sure you could find something cheaper and just as good at your local store."
2,Young Adult Fiction,"Fans of the Liaden Universe be warned; this is not your usual Lee and Miller. Written in a very unsophisticated style and with a plot that goes almost nowhere, this book does not capture the imagination or the intellect in the way that Liaden or Gem (where are you, Gem??) stories do. Buy it for your young readers, but pass it by if you are over 20. I didn't even finish it - a first for a Lee & Miller collaboration."
3,Not my favorite,"I love Lee & Miller's ""Liaden"" books, but sadly, this novel did not live up to that level. I felt like the entire thing was ""set up"" for future books without much plot of its own and it had a very unsatisfying ending. I don't mind multi-novel series, but I do expect each individual book to be somewhat complete in and of itself. Also, I didn't identify much with the teenage main characters, but perhaps that might not be a problem for a younger audience."
1,Poorly written juvie that should be marketed as such,"I generally enjoy Lee and Miller, but this novel is a cheat. It is clearly a juvie, shallowly written and barely plotted. It is painfully not a stand-alone book--it fails to end, it simply terminates, as has this reader's interest in further reading of Lee and Miller. Unless you are age 12, don't bother."
4,"A chiling, thought provoking book","Pork is a collection of short stories about animals living in the forest. It is an in depth look at nature and how it could be perceived if the animals had personalities. The stories can be quite chilling and disturbing. Sometimes, the meaning of each story is not clear, but you will find it if you look hard enough."
2,Leaves so much un-answered,"I was really disappointed with this book. Its great for high level concepts but if you just want to know why to use StringBuffers rather than Strings for complex operations then this book isn't it. It covers topics such as class loading but mostly ignores common coding techniques which can have more efficient alternatives. The fact that it has a whole section on JNI perfromance sort of says it all.As the book is so thin anyway, it could really do with being thickened up with a lot more examples. I may glance it it occasionally but I really wish I hadn't bought it at all."
2,Could be great but ......,"When the Toshiba modem is running, it is running great. However, one thing that the Toshiba modems suffers from is packet loss. This particular model is very sensative to RF signal noise. Because of it's sensativity to RF siganals, you will experience lags of 15 to 25 seconds because of packet loss. Other modems that I have tested are not as sensative and don't suffer from this problem. I would still recommend this modem if you only surf the net. However, if you plan on using this modem for gaming or streaming content off of the web, stay away."
1,Think about this,"First time, were ok, but the material inside breaks down. I carried these in and out and only wore them at the stand. It a gimmick, but if you don't believe me, then buy em."
2,"So many spelling, punctuation and mechanical errors!!!","There were more spelling, punctuation and mechanical errors in this book than I have EVER seen in any other book. I even contacted the publisher re this.As a teacher I felt I could not recommend this editing-flawed book as it is the antithesis of the kind of careful editing I espouse.One very humorous aside is that part of the dedication is to her editor for careful attention to detail, or something close to that.The story is interesting, but not compelling. One section, about a home invasion, is never really explained at all. It simply happens. Why does it occur? Simply to advance the story?Limon's book entitled Ana Calderone is better written and far better edited."
3,printer compatibility,Does anyone know whether this router can be made compatible with the HP 8150 photosmart USB printer?
4,Interesting read,"This book was interesting, and helped my 80 year-old father to take up a hobby that has always interested him. However, the information in the book is somewhat out of date."
4,Great sound,"The performance is very good, the audio even better. The one thing that may confuse you at first is the orchestra set up. I finally looked up a picture of the orchestra- the basses are on the left as you face the orchestra. There are a few other changes from a traditional American set up also. It was a little disconcerting at first but once I knew that it wasn't a technical mistake in the recording I was able to visualize the musicians as the music overtook me."
4,"REA is always good review material, a great reference for this test.","As any CLEP, this book does not cover everything you will see in this exam. However, if you are good at tests, this is the book you need. I studied for 4 hours (read the material and did the first practice test. Then did a the practice test in the Offical CLEP Study Guide 17th Edition) and then took the test. I scored a 62 without using any other source for studying. I'm not suggesting the short study times I usually use, be your own judge and know your own abilities, but this book will help you pass this test."
4,CLEP U.S. History II,"This book was very helpful. I also watch a lot of the History Channel! Use the College Board's CLEP Official Study Guide, 17th Edition it helps. The practice tests will let you know what to brush-up on. I scored a 69."
3,Interesting,"For those of you new or not familiar with Astara, this organization was founded in 1951 by Robert and Earlyn Chaney. Other sources say it was founded on May 1, 1954. There is a strong Christian element in Astara. This book of Astara, like many others deals with a lot of New Age subjects such as mysticism. If you go deeper into the symbolism of Astara you'll notice a seven pointed star with a lotus in the middle. This star represents the perfected man. The seven pointed star and the lotus is also tied into the Ancient Mystic Order of Melchizedek. Astara is very to the Rosicrucians, but more watered down. There explaination about the seven pole stars is very fascinating and kind of goes into the realm of astrology. But over all, besides for the symbolism and the knowledge of the pole stars, this book is still the basic New Age information dealing with karma and philosophy."
4,A Good Start,"The Good - It's basically like playing a board game on your PC. The graphics are simple but crisp and nice to look at, and the interface is smooth and easy to navigate. You're given a good amount of countries to choose from and units to command. It's also been glitch free for me.The Not So Good - The AI is predictible. A common complaint for games like this. It's not horrible, but it could be better. The backgroud music is a little plain and can get old after a while. And while I know this game is all about strategic nuclear war, I can't help but wish for a slower build-up to it. Your basic units are nuclear silos, battleships, carriers, submarines, bombers, and fighters. It'd be nice if maybe ground units were added and countries were split into territories or states. Players could then attempt to invade other players and possibly seize their weapons before they're used.Overall, it's a fun game that doesn't really get old. It will, however, leave you wanting more."
2,Weak and Incomplete,"""The Newhall Incident"" interested me because the crime occurred in my hometown and I personally witnessed the police action in attempting to capture one of the perpetrators. But the book read too much like fiction in that the author constantly expressed thoughts and ideas on behalf of the people involved in the incident. Since those people lost their lives that day, we can never know what they were really thinking. The book would have been more valuable if the author had stuck to the facts. He also went way overboard on the use of profanity which made for difficult reading and detracted from his attempt to draw a psychological profile of the perpetrators."
1,The movie was in a foreign language,"When I downloaded I didn't know that the movie was in a foreign language, I believe French. English was displayed in words throughout the movie, but even so bad plot, terrible acting, bad ending."
1,I am not to sure about this toy,"Fortunally I bought this airplane second hand. Most of the pieces were there, except the ice cubes (I really didn't miss that) it was in good condition. My daughter played with it a couple of times and lost interest. The wings do fall off. I am glad that I didn't pay full price for it."
5,"Very Fun, but falls apart easly...","I got this barbie airplaine when I was 7 years old for christmas. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world until the chairs fell out and the mini labels on everything slipped off. But overall, it is very cute and defanatly makes playing with barbies fun when barbie and ken are going on a vacation!"
1,What A Nightmare!,"This toy is a nightmare. It is poorly put together and falls into pieces with even the slightest bump. For example, if you bump it with your foot the wings (both body and tail) will fall off. The main door to the plane will not stay closed as it should. The numerous tiny parts are a mess and litter the play area. This is extra annoying when you have a younger sibbling crawling around looking for things to stick in their mouth. It's also a pretty big toy. Even so, Barbie and Friends barely fit into the cabin. If you have tons of room and patience...go for it. Otherwise go for a Barbie Car and live a happier life!"
5,Please remain seated until we come to a complete stop.,"I was impressed with this toy and my daughter loves is as well. I thought Mattel were pretty good with detail but I think the ice cubes were going a bit far, but they are easily replaced with plastic craft pellets. They really need to rethink their seatbelts in all Barbie vehicles, because they are difficult to use I simply remove them. My daughter is much happier this way. Although I think I'll need to replace the airplane ones with velcro and elastic. As for the small bits, I've yet to see a Barbie doll or accessories without them. If the wings fall off, use it as an opportunity for a crash and evacuation. It doesn't hurt to teach a child what to do in an emergency.If there are problems with a toy ask your child to think of a solution. It's better than crying over it."
4,Cool Toy,When I got this plane I was really happy. I took my Barbie dolls on lots of trips. There are really small pieces that come with it so I just keep them in a little container. That way I don't have a mess. This is a great toy to play with. I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world.
2,I shipped it back to Mattel for a refund- it's so cheap!!!,"This is the most poorly design toy I have ever seen. I called Mattel and they picked it up and refunded the money back to me. Our daughter couldn't even play with it. The seats didn't stay on, the doors wouldn't stay closed, and the tail kept falling off. It's horrendous...."
1,Blah,Im sorry but this album is really bland with no real songs. Its a total work in progress type of album. More like sketches for an album that shoulda been worked on for another year. Ive heard that the Johnny Marr produced second album is better but ive yet to purchase it. But this record belongs in the clearance bin where im sure youll find it
3,The Junkman.,"Horrible acting, and plot, but lots of cool stunts, beautiful corvette(sadly crashed and smashed). a little bit long, and not enough stunts for the time, First 40 minutes or so is a Eldorado Caddy Being chased by A T-bird and Buick LeSabre. Ok Movie. Just wish there was no acting and the Corvette Would be the Main Vehicle."
3,"Decent, but not fantastic.","I really love the rich color of these sheets (aubergine) and simple design because they look absolutely fabulous.However, I give a three-star rating because I am not that thrilled with the feel of these sheets. I have purchased 400+ thread-count sateen sheets before, but these happen to be rather stiff, even after a handful of washings. They aren't that bad, but do not meet my expectations. I even got ""rug-burn"" after having first used them.Next time I buy sheets I'm going with Egyptian Cotton."
3,Pinzon Sheets,"These Sheets are Ok, Not The exact color I was looking for, A little more money than expeted for the Quality. They do fit very well, Cal. King sheets are harder to find in the style an colors I want."
4,Very Comfortable,"The only thing I'd point out to shoppers is that the ribbons give the fabric a minimal rough texture, although the fabric is very soft. Very durable and have held their color well through washing. Product arrived on time and in new condition as ordered with no factory defects."
5,"Sheet set, 440 count",Very nice and comfortable. I haven't had new sheets in years and these are so wonderful. I got the auberine color and am very pleased with them.
1,Inflated thread count - No bargain,"You get what you pay for. These sheets are not 440 thread count. Google ""thread count"" and you'll come across articles that discuss how some sellers inflate thread count to increase sales. I think these sheets belong in that category. They're not smooth and tight like sheets with this high a thread count should be. They're OK for the price but I won't buy this Brand again."
3,Just OK,Felt soft right out of the package but after washing I was disappointed in how stiff they felt. I'm hoping they will soften with additional washing. They are thick and will probably last for years especially being on the spare bed. OK for the money but I won't buy them again.
4,how i enjoyed the music of the lord of the rings,"After the cd box of lord of the rings the fellowship ,i thought how wonderful to listen to the complete score but i wish i had all 3!Now i have the 2 towers I am even more amazed what wonderful music thiscomposer has made.If you like lord of the rings and or filmmusic this is a box you schould not miss,it is more then complete!Now i am waiting for part 3 when? i hope it comes soon!enjoy! miranda"
4,give her a chance!!!!!,"After reading all of the reviews for this album, iam totally shocked. First of all, i think people are expecting an electronic zero 7 sound. Thats what you are not going to get, thank god. Sophie has made a charming organic smooth album. Mostly acoustic guitar with that gorgeous voice is all she needs. Robin guthrie from the cocteau twins adds his atmosperic guitar edge on 4 cuts, which are worth buying the album alone! Sophies biggest mistake on her debut was not letting robin produce the whole thing. His etheriel sound compliments her voice just perfect. But, make no mistake, the rest of the album is worth the buy."
2,The Best of Gloria Gaynor,This item was purchased as a gift. I can not tell you very much about the product only the experience ordering and receiving it. Original order got lost. Replacement order exceeded my expectations with the immediate satisfaction of both handling that issue and replacing it in time to enable me to give it as a present in time.
1,Beware!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS! This is a completely lame collection, missing most of the band's best songs. Get the vastly superior Gold instead."
3,Grateful Dead Anthology,"Its a decent book, as far as sheet music goes... all of the tunes were transcribed from album versions it seems, as sections of songs or alternate lyrics etc that are common live are missing.this is a 'guitar' book, though it does have phil's lines notated.this book doesnt not have weir's unique chord voicings. instead it has its chords notated in 'open position'.This book is great for beginning musicians who can read, or for those who cant hear the odd time signatures or melodies by ear.for instance, Playin in the band is in 10/4, though this book splits it up as two bars of 4, then one of 2."
3,Just as a complement,"This book show you positions, ideas and some games. No lines, no variants. If you want to make a deep study get another book."
5,Great Game,"I severely think this game is under rated. Its the sequel to Chrono Trigger but has almost a completely new engine. Personally, I think this game is great and deserves better ratings."
2,Well.....,"Well heres my opinion on this game, i personally didnt think it was all that great. NO exp NO leveling up NO Magic Points (MP) WORSE story than the origanal. Sorry im getting ahead of myself. this is what happened i went to the video store and saw that they had chrono cross in i was so excited! i thought this game would be better than the origanal Chrono Trigger was but i was highly dissapointed. the story is EXTREAMLY slow and dull. and im not a novice RPG player so i know a bad story when i see one and THIS was a bbbbbaaaaaadddddd story. I really dont see why they had to dump Chrono and all the other charactors for the new 40+ Charactors! why the heck do we need 40 characters when you can only use 3 at a time? anyway thats my opinion. if you really wanna see how much this game stinks buy chrono Trigger or one of the classic Final Fantasys that game is the best RPG ever made!"
5,The word... GREAT!!,"If you think Chrono Trigger was great 5 years ago, this long-awaited sequel has proved greater beyond imagination. Cross sets out as Serge suddenly transported into an alternate universe where he died 10 years ago. Now, he and Kid and other allies must get to the Frozen Esper to discover the truth... but others has the eyes for the Esper as well.The graphics and the characters were well-detailed by all standards, and the music is breathtaking (way to go, Yasunori!). So if you're a CT junkie a few years ago, you'll appreciate the big challenge of Chrono Cross (now joins the PlayStation's Greatest Hits!). This is, by the fact, the beginning of the new Chrono saga, and it won't stop there."
5,FF8 killer baby!,"I played FF8 and japanese version of Chrono cross and wow! FF8 was ..........good. But this game got it all, the graphic, the story line kicks, and so much options. My parents had major problems with this game since my grade average went down 1 whole grade thanks to this game. Can't wait for this U.S. version."
3,I just didn't like this game...,"First of all, I am a huge RPG fan....especially the squaresoft rpgs. Maybe it's just me, but I just couldn't stand Chrono Cross. It's okay for a while, but it just gets so boring and you'll never play it again. I think the plot is just stupid and the boss just isn't ..evil enough.Like I said, maybe it's just me. Anyway...The Graphics are great, the sound is alright, control is good, but the gameplay dissapointed me. I just didn't like the battles. They just get so boring.The characters...eh, well...are just stupid! Not all of them, but most of them.All in all, I just didn't like this game. I am a HUGE RPG fan and I was really looking forward to this game, but it just got so boring that I got rid of it."
2,Font is Unbelievably Small,"I'm sure the story is good; most of the reviewers have endorsed it enthusiastically. I'll never know, however, at least as long as I own this particular printing of the book, because the font is unbelievably small. Arial 7 is a close approximation."
2,Mixed Review,"The Project Manager is a nice feature, but 2004 is full of bugs and problems. Some examples: when trying to save in Word, you have to use the ""Column Browser"" which lists your top tier folders and destinations, and recent folders, but you can't access subfolders. Very annoying. Entourage rules that worked in Office X don't work, and when I redo, they still don't work other than manually. Send and Receive schedule works occasionally, no pattern to its failure I can see. Mail view listings in outbox show sender (me!) not recepient. Really, some of the problems are just plain careless or thoughtless, and online support worthless at this stage. I would wait until problems fixed."
3,Not really that stable,"The very first time I used, Word would repeatedly crash when trying to switch language from the TOOLS menu. Powerpoint still lacksuster compared to Keynote."
4,Office 2004 for Mac is a nice improvement,"I bought the Office 2004 upgrade, finally, because certain minor misfits of Office X with current versions of Mac OS X became too annoying. It is an improvement. Those annoying crashes and refusals to bring the desired window to the front disappeared. It has a few nice formatting improvements, such as Page view in Excel. Powerpoint seems a little more refined. I thought that I'd like Word's notebook view, because I used the stand-alone product on Windows. I have not found it useful, however, partly because I like the Circus Ponies products."
1,Entourage is flawed,"If you use a Palm Tungsten T or E, and other PDA's, the Entourage conduit is not compatible and will not allow you to sych your handheld with Entourage. This is a serious flaw if you use Entourage as your primary address, emal, calendar and to do list application. Microsoft is completely aware of this and offers no excuse. They simply state that the Entourage conduit will not work and they have no solution for it.In Office X the Entourage conduit worked flawlessly."
1,The Sands of time,I order books in Spanish for an elderly aunt and when I first clicked on this book it was the Spanish edition. Somehow it came to her in English. This is not the first time this has happenned.
1,"If the dog doesn't like it, why spend $ on ""Natural""","My toy poodle loves to brush his teeth. He jumps right up. I have previously bought more ""commercial"" products on Amazon and at pet stores. I decided to try this ""natural"" toothpaste peanut butter flavor. My dog does not like this ""natural"" product. I wasted my money. No matter how natural anything is, if it doesn't work, it's not worth it."
3,Cool but could use more detail,"Cool set, but could use more detail and the packaging is god awful. When you try to open package the little people go flying. You need to open them in a box so you can block their flight pattern coming out of the package. I think put them on a strip of tape or in a jewel case would have made more sense."
1,SMALL PEOPLE,"WHEN I RECEIVED THESE PEOPLE, I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEY WERE SO SMALL. I DO NOT HAVE A SET UP THAT WILL ACCOMADATE THESE FIGURINES. THEY ARE ABOUT 1/2 "" TALL. I WAS HOPING THAT THEY WOULD OF BEEN AT LEAST 1"" TALL.I HAVE MS AND MY GRIP ON THINGS ARE NOT SO GOOD."
5,Perfect for Bookshelves,I just bought one of these bins to put some of my daughters small toys in hoping that I would be able to store it on her bookshelf. It fits so perfectly and the bookshelf is only 10 inches deep! I am definitely going to get several more of these.Also they seem very well made. I sew a lot and whenever I buy anything I always check seems and fabric quality. Not one stich was loose or even plyable when I checked the item over. And with the handles it is easier for my daughter to pull it off the shelf and put it back.I highly recommend this bin along with all of the other items in this collection.
3,There's Stanley and Marcus and Victor x2,"This collection is quite funky and well produced (hat's off to the frighteningly tasty Jeff Lorber), however...One the ""real tip"" Marcus Miller as a writer and player is the ""serious joint.""It's time for the Amazon jazz heads to revisit a more complete ""Jazz Basist"" place. Start with Ray Brown, Ron Carter and move to Victor Bailey, Vic Wooten, Marcus Miller, John Pattatucci... Afterwhich, make a leisurely stop at a legend ""gone too soon"" call JACO!"
4,"So he sounds like Biggie, I'd take it as a compliment","Like most people who heard this kat, there is no doubt he's wearing Biggie's baritone flow and cadence on his sleeve somethin' sick. But it sure feels good to hear it. It almost sounds like this album was made in between Ready to Die and Life After Death. I was definitely feelin' the LP, and I must give him his respect due. A little ironic thing I noticed though was that his leadoff track ""Hearts of Fire"" sampled the Bob Marley track that Shyne sampled on ""Quasi OG"" from his latest joint as well."
1,"""F*** the flow/Y'all jackin' our slang""","Guerrilla Black's album seems more like a horrible attempt to play off popularity of one of hip-hop's most creative minds. From the voice right down to the flow, Black has shown that imitation is not the sincerist form of flatter. The introspect on this album is dull and unimaginative, and my little brother has come up with better production on his Fisher-Price ""My First Roland 808"" playset."
4,WE'RE JUST THE BAND,"As far as three guys go, this is definitely great rock n roll! Galley, Hughes, and Holland, unite again for a barn burning set of intense music. Their careers were way too short, at least as Trapeze, but their influence on the music scene was immense. The vocals of Glenn Hughes are undeniably great, as is his deep bass sound. Galley and Holland are no slouches on their instuments either. This disc starts out on fire with ""Keeping Time"" and burns through til the title track, ""You Are the Music, We're Just the Band. Another couple of my favorite tracks are ""Coast to Coast"" and ""Loser"". This CD is a great dose of unforgettable 70's rock that is still as vital today as it was then. Like a fine wine, some things just get better with age."
5,Best Compass Ever?,"This is my second Suunto SK7 compass. The first lasted some 1,000 dives, and worked great except the numbers were worn off from too many dives! This compass has a good tilt tolerance, and is calibrated for Suunto's Zone 1. So, it's not calibrated for Hawaii, but it's close enough! I'm using this with the Suunto Cobra 2, as I find the Cobra 2's built-in digital compass completely worthless."
4,"Great, Easy to Use, Quality Product",Bought this as an add on for my Cobra 2 because I don't like the digital compass on it and I like having a dedicated compass so that I can still see my computer gauges. Works great. Large and easy to read. Works at up to +/- 30 deg tilt which is more than most and any digital computer gauge that I have seen. Be careful of the zone calibration. This is zone 1. Works good at home and while not calibrated for my trip to Hawaii. Only complaint is the price.
5,Replacement,My original Suunto SK7 compass began to leak after 5 years & wouldn't function. Suunto wouldn't replace the original. This one works well & is designed to fit the original housing.
2,many typos in the api section,"I bought to learn the maya api--I did not use the mel section.While this title may be one of the best maya programming books, it hassome problems, foremost of which is typos in the code sections. Note thatCode Examples are availible on the website, and there is an errata section.Mostly--you can work around the shortcomings. Read it with the autodeskdocs--they supplement each other well--"
4,It's OK,The materials are fine but the printing is very hard to read. We mostly got it to show our son how the sun works so readability wasn't a big deal.
3,fine but collor not as vibrant,"I got it for my 14 month old so am not looking for educational value. The collor is a bit pale and did not catch his eyes. He did show interest when I inflated it, but lost interest very soon."
5,Excellent Book,I really reccomend this book. This book give you a unique blending of the four gospels.I love it !
3,high cholesterol! otherwise good protein,"warning: This product has 30mg cholesterol per scoop. If you use it often, make sure you get your blood checked by a doctor. I take about 3 scoops/day, eat very healthy, yet in 7 months from taking this protein my ""bad"" cholesterol jumped from 98 to 130 (my diet remained the same). Fish oil pills will help keep that down.My initial impressions is that the taste (Vanilla Icecream) is acceptable as I've had tastier with other brands. Still acceptable, and within a week I got used to it and it started tasting just fine. I mix it with just a spoon in a mug . . . small chunks float on the top, but good enough and doesn't really bother me.I find this protein really helps with the recovery period, and it has a great blend of other additives in it."
3,"Sexy, just not like the pic","I ordered this dress thinking it'd look at least a little bit like the picture, at least be pretty skintight., but it wasn't. The rubber look material was nice and shiny though. When I put it on, it just has a bunch of folds everywhere unless I pull it straight down, which I can't really do if I'm wearing it. It is a pretty sexy dress though, it goes nice with heels. Just doesn't look like the pic at all though."
5,Best Animated Movie from the 80s,"I first saw this movie back in 1988 and, being a huge fan of Debbie Harry and Cheap Trick, I was smitten with it. Unfortunately I soon found I could not get a copy of it anywhere. I ended up ordering it on VHS from a small video store and paid $80 for the tape! Boy do I feel dumb now that it has been re-released on DVD, all these years later. In my opinion, this is THE best hand-painted cell animation movie from the 80's. The animation is smooth and extremely detailed (worthy of Disney or Warner Brothers), and the story is interesting. What really ices the cake though is the movie's amazing sound track, with songs by artists such as Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, and Cheap Trick, all written specifically for this movie and can't be found anywhere else. The movie is a cult classic and quite unique. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies, or of animated films, then you need to own this one!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this edition because I remembered seeing both The Devil and Daniel Mouse and Rock and Rule on TV as a kid. I loved both of them. I was quite frankly disappointed with this purchase for the following reasons:1) The art in the US version isn't as clear as it should be. The picture is kind of grainy and in some scenes, the lines in the characters aren't as crisp as they should be. Considering what can be done with computers and special effects these days, Unearthed Films could have done a better job retouching the appearance of the film.2) The Devil and Daniel Mouse has scenes missing from it. At first I thought I had a defective disk until I read another reviewer who noticed the same thing. If Unearthed Films was going to take the time to put Daniel Mouse on DVD, they should have made sure it was complete.Bottom line, if you have to have this in your collection, get the one disk package. Only get the Collector's Edition if you have to see the CBC version for yourself."
5,Rock n Rule,I saw this first when I was a teenager and fell in love with this silly movie. It definitely has that 80s nostalgic feel to it. Lots of fun.
1,What a waste of money!,"I spent a lot of money on this blender hoping for something with commercial oomph. I used it less than 20 times and have never been happy with it... cannot keep it on (only has timed settings), has no speed control. . . and it's now broken. I have to fiddle with the fuse to make it work every time I use. When I turn it off, I have to play with the fuse again to turn it on. Spend the same money and get a BlendTec like I did. WOW! That thing blends the socks off even the VitaMix!"
1,Unusable arrival!!!,"I assume the product would have been ok but, it arrived in an unusable condition. Insufficient packing material was used in a box that was too big for the two quarts of paint that was ordered. The paint cans were bent and misshappened resulting in a hole in one of the cans. The entire mess was deposited in the trash and now resides in the city landfill. I had a deadline to meet using the ordered paint which necessitated a local purchase."
2,Bank,I bought this bank for my 4 year little girl.. Came yesterday and let me tell you that its going to be lucky to hold $2.00 in Change.. Very tiny.. Not at all what I expected for the price and I would not recomend it to anyone.
1,Too small to call a piggy bank,"I was shocked to see the size of this bank, maybe a dollars worth of change can be put into it."
5,Love this book!,"As an Elementary school librarian, this was always one of my favorite books to read aloud to my students ages K-3rd. They all loved the story, then I was thrilled during discussion time to see the light go on as they came to realize just what that 'wretched stone' was. They were all appalled when they thought about how much time they spent, sitting around staring at the TV in their house. So I had to order a copy to have in my own home to read to my Grandchildren."
2,Do yourself a favor and read the book,"A bad movie based on the best basketball book of all time. The basketball scenes are not realistic or interesting, I just couldn't get over this fact. Its a basketball movie with a lot of time spent on the court. It should at least be fun to watch them play. Its not. The Bo Kimble cameo is the only thing that mildly interested me about this movie. It tries to throw in several playground legends and stories and real-life experiences, but ends up coming off as a non-believable, overdone movie."
2,Very confusing,"It would work nicely (I think) if you can figure out how to get it on. And when you do figure it out, you won't the next time. Maybe it should be color coded or something!!!???"
1,Stuart Woods is a far left liberal contempt for Repulicans,"Dopy story. Fiction at its extreme. I was planning on reading ""all"" of Woods books but his far left view and his contempt for Republican views are just too extreme. It would be okay if he just supported his Dems but making one feel that one is a racist, does not care about other people puts him right in step with Obama and Hitler. Goodbye"
1,Chicago edition fail,"How in the world did Chicago decide that Mumford's images were a) not ""practical"" or ""necessary"" to include in this edition b) still important enough that they include the original captions and--I am not making this up--a list of hilariously unhelpful ""keywords"" with which we're supposed to search on the Internet for the images, or else ""similar"" ones?One can only assume Chicago, which regularly ruins manuscripts that should have more or better images in them than they do, just refused to pay the 500 bucks it would have taken to prep the b&w; images in photoshop and print them in the book. The Chicago explanation makes it sound like it's harder to process images now than it was in 1934! Totally ridiculous.What a tragedy! I'd been so long waiting for this book to come back in print. Still, I think I'll keep my copy as a cautionary tale for authors considering Chicago. Ugh."
5,Fascinating,I got this for my grandson and he loves it. It is fun to watch and easy to set up. The lights change color and the speed is flexible. He watches it for a long time and we all enjoy. Great gift!
4,So far so good,"It's only been 48 hours but it seems to keep 'good time', and the alarm works. I wish the alarm 'indicator hand' was a little more easier to see. And, of course, like all things made in ""the Big C"", there are some minor flaws in the wood surface. Also, the inside of the clock face had some visble, but slightly annoying dust particles that I couldn't 'get at'. And I wish that the back of the clock had a cover of some sort, as it will be sitting on someone's desk, and 'visitors' to their office will see the buttons and knobs of the back of a typical clock mechanism. If it was meant to fit on an office desk with the back-side facing towards visitors, a sleek covering to that mechanism would have been nicer looking."
2,Nothing special... a big dissapointment,"When I rented this movie, I was expecting a hillarious comedy like the Friday triology was. Insted all you get, is a cheesy ""familly"" drama with very very few funny moments. Tracy Morgan's character wasn't funny enough, and Katt Williams' talents were wasted over a character who didn't have any funny lines at all. Ice Cube plays the exactly same part he plays in all of his movies... It's a deccent drama, but definitely not a comedy. A huge dissapointment, and that's why the movie failed worldwide."
2,TRACY MORGAN DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS!,"'The First Sunday' is disappointing to fans of Tracy Morgan as it's really not the vehicle I imagined for Morgan. It's not an un-watchable film, but I've seen too many of these half-baked sentimental comedies to watch one that just doesn't cut it. If you can get through the slow first half, it does get better in the second.....just not enough for me to recommend it."
1,The Old Familiar Plot Returns Again,"How many times must this story be written and turned into a movie? This is just a real boring movie that has been done time and time again. In this film, they make a party school and pretend it is real until they are discovered and have to prove to the authorities that it is a school worth saving. This same plot was done in a movie just a few years ago called Old School. The only difference is that they were trying to save a party Sorority house instead of a school, and had to prove it worth keeping. That movie was way better. Overall, just another teen college flick that is predictable and done to death. I'm just glad I watched it on TV instead of paying to see it"
3,A grudging 3 stars,"I have greatly enjoyed Kent's Bolitho Novels, mainly because I had read Hornblower as well as the Aubrey/Maturin novels, and was infected with the love of the genre.I'll not compare Bolitho to those other worthies as he is not them nor they him, however I do think that Mr Kent should have killed off our more-than-maudlin Admiral in book 17 or 18.I found this book a nice way to spend my reading time for a day or so, but in truth, I can't recommend it as one of Kent's best."
5,Soul plus precision,"Many chef/restaurant cookbooks suffer from recipes that simply don't work; ripped from the context of professional kitchens by busy chefs, the recipes are often poorly written or simply wrong. NOT IN THIS CASE. This is the lovely exception, signature dishes from a great restaurant that are replicable by competent home cooks. And, these are clever, inventive dishes that make the most out of their combination of ingredients. Underneath it all is the soul of farmstead cooking overlaid with imagination and professionalism. The best chef cookbook I've seen in a long time."
2,"Great film for 'horny 13 yr old boys'....otherwise, forget it!","This was a 'made for the adolescent film crowd movie'....just got just enough of a teen hottie next door (in a bikini) for every 13 yr old boy to yank on his tube steak to! The Capt. was very disappointed with this one...I even predicted the 'deer in the plastic bag scene'! (That's pretty bad!)That surprising, realistic car wreck in the first minute or two of this film gets one star from me...and that hot teenage girl in her bikini gets the other star...if she would have taken it off at some point...I may have given this farce of a movie a star or two more!You watch PG-13 films....you get PG-13 films!"
2,"I still prefer ""Rear Window""","Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is an absolute classic. It ranks with ""The Birds,"" ""Psycho,"" and ""North by Northwest"" as one of his finest films. ""Disturbia"" on the other hand . . . well I will honestly say that I still think ""Rear Window"" is far superior to this fairly horrible re-imagining. And I mean ""fairly"" horrible, because Shia LeBeouf, Carrie-Ann Moss, and David Morse give very good performances. But aside from that, ""Disturbia"" is pretty much a weak thriller. It involves cheap scares, lame humor, and a really mediocre script. It did have some decent moments, but other than that, I consider this as bad as other thrillers that have been released in this certain decade that we're living in right now. I still choose ""Rear Window."""
4,Disturbia,"This was good but not as ""sit on the edge of your seat"" that I thought it would be. It was a good purchase tho. Shia LaBeouf is such a great up and coming star--one to watch for sure."
4,Good HD DVD Title,"I am still searching for the best movie to show off my HD DVD other than Planet Earth. Is the the movie... Well picture is great and crisp, thes sound is great, the story is pretty good, no major plot holes, the acting is very good especially from Shia LaBeouf, who is very funny. Yet even though I liked this movie it was not impressive enough for me to buy to feel the urge to buy. My advice rent before you buy."
3,Surprisingly Good,"Akin to teenagers' slasher genre, this movie is there to shock and to horrify you when you are the least expected. Yes, all the predictable plots are there such as a puberty hiting teenager is bored stuck at home, a new neighbour with a gorgeous daughter with the body to die for moves next door, and what's to happen when you leave him with a binocular? When he's taking his voyeurism trip, he comes across incidents that he doesn't mean to see and it's only a matter of time when troubles come knocking on the door. For those that are acquainted to Hitchcock's suspense movie, you probably get an idea of what to expect but with a cheap thrill on the side. An effective movie with good support from tremendous cast. A good movie to watch on a rainy night. Commendable watching."
3,an average remake,"I knew renting this that it was basically ""Rear Window"" with a bit of a twist. The twist is that instead of being handicapped, out hero is ""spacially challeneged"" as the result of being sentenced to three months house arrest for slugging a teacher. The young cast, especially Shia Le Bouf, is very engaging; David morse and Carrie Ann Moss provide very realistic adults. The problem with the film is that it's just not original. It's ""Rear Window"" with a few other conventions tossed in. You've got the weird use of video a la the ""Blair Witch Project"", a bit of ""Scream"" anf the Gen X thriller ilk, and it just doesnt' come across as anything new. The three stars is for the cast, which really carries the film. Had they been worse, so would the rating."
2,Description is misleading,"The description listed on Amazon is misleading. It seems to be confusing two different people: Salman the Persian, who was a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH); and the Prophet Solomon, who was a king of the Israelites. The subtitle on the box art looks correct from what I can tell. I haven't been able to watch the video yet. Hopefully the content is correct, and the only issue is the Amazon description."
5,Salman the persian,"Beyond my expectation! Every house must have it! My family love to watch it again and again. I know the story of Salman, but this movie brought me to tears..."
4,Paul Newman and Henry Fonda a great pair,Paul Newman and Henry Fonda star in this 1970's film about logging in the Northwest and both its physical and emotional hardships. A movie made before the spotted owl was in vogue. A must-see for anyone in the wood supply business. Henry Fonda at his best.
4,DVD details,"Original aspect ratio. Fine print. No extras. No menu. Recommended.Film: 8/10Picture quality 8.5/10Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (orig.)Run time (NTSC 60Hz): 1:54'33""Chpt.: 12Audio: Engl.ST: -RC 1Bonus: -Studio: UniversalDVD-R: will ONLY play on DVD player, NOT on PC drive or DVD recorder etc.If you like to find out more about Ken Kesey you might check out these books:""Haight Ashbury"", Charles Perry""Storming Heaven"", Jay Stevens""Electric Kool Aid Acid Test"", Tom Wolfe""On the Bus: The Complete Guide to the Legendary Trip of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and the Birth of the Counterculture"", Paul Perry, Michael Schwartz and Neil Ortenberg"
3,Trapped,"I only want to tell you of one scene in this. Trust me, students of film will know it when it occurs. An unforgetable scene. If you don't mind seeing a film, just for the pleasure of one unbreakable moment, then see this one. A 5 star, and very powerful, Newman-esque scene. I do respect those that like this movie, because Paul Newman is always great in whatever he does. Please forgive the previous version of this review that spelled the scene out in detail, I only wanted to encourage others who would never watch it - to give it a chance. It's brilliant."
5,"Criterion, What Are You Waiting For?","This epic, powerfully acted, and visually breathtaking movie beg for the Criterion DVD treatment. What can they be waiting for? The characters in this film, bigger than life, seem to be acted by the only actors who could possibly do justice to the roles. The cinematography is lush and beautifully composed on location in the Pacific Northwest, and the dialogue keeps the film moving effortlessly, as though one were a member of the family of loggers portrayed in the film. Sign me up to purchase the DVD as soon as it is released, hopefully by Criterion."
5,English Audio: Problematic,"UPDATE (3-22-2011): It's unfortunate that Amazon continues to lump together the various reviews of a particular film that derive from disparate sources. My below-listed review of ""Sometimes A Great Notion"", for example, was written on behalf of two non-U.S. dvd region (PAL) versions that came out quite a while ago, and have nothing to do with this new Universal (2011) Vault Series version. I don't know why Europe was so far ahead of the U.S. in getting this wonderful film to dvd, but I suspect that this new ""manufacturing on demand"" (MOD) dvd will be quite satisfactory. Better late, than never; at least now, you don't need to buy a region-free dvd player to watch Paul Newman et al bring this powerful story to life.UPDATE (12-21-2012): I just watched the new bluray of this film, and it is so clearly better than any of the preceding dvds that I have deleted those comments. You will, however, have to shut off the curious English subtitles. Enjoy!"
2,for those not planning to read the book!,"Poor adaptation of an incredible novel.Might be worth watching ,if you're not feeling like reading a 600 pages text anyway, but all the fine details of the book that make it tick are lost here..Not a success like ""Cuckoo's Nest"""
5,Nice case for Kodak Playsport,"There is enough space in this case for my PlaySport and a couple of other small items (key, cash, cards, etc.) and it appears to be durable and well made. Best case I found in stores, better purchase price on Amazon."
3,Use Caution,"Bought NOW Amino Complete and Nature's Way Astragalus Root because I saw a show on Dr Oz about lack of energy.Took both at the same time and was ""sicker than a dog"" with flu like symptoms for about 12 hours.Later tried Nature's Way Astragalus Root alone and it seemed okay (didn't get sick)Could have just been the combo of the two together???Use caution - herbs are medicine too ;)"
4,happy with amino acids,"I think this is a great product, has all the amino acids needed for health daily. I would purchasde this product agin."
5,It works! just amazing,"What does this seminar offer is a natural way to bypass orgasm, and this is a whole new approach to MMO, since all books available in the market so far (including The Multi Orgasmic Man) teach you how to become multi-orgasmic by actually forcing your PC muscle not to contract, hence having dry orgasm.However, with this new method presented in the seminar, I simply learned how to skip ejaculating and focus on enjoying orgasm which lasts way longer and feels all over your body, rather than squeezing, trying to block ejaculating, that is if you're lucky to do it on time.This thing does work, and the results are simply amazing, this new discovery has simply redefined sexuality for me, I never felt so much intense orgasms all over my body, your whole body becomes one organ.Highly recommened!!"
2,No Wonder It's Not Being Reprinted,"I fell for the hype and searched the world over for a copy of this book. Finally found one out of an online book dealer in Paris and paid $47 total for a copy. The book is OK but there's hardly anything new for even basic Munster fans. The copy is strrrrrrreeeeeeettttttccccchhhhhhhhhhhed throughout, for example, wide, wide margins and some pages have just one or two lines of text. Sorry, but this was one of the most anticipated books for my collection and I feel completely ripped-off. I would feel the same had I paid the book jacket price as well. Cox's Addams Family book is leaps and bounds better than this. Live and learn."
5,"Polly went back 3,000 years ago and almost had to stay.","I loved this book a lot. If you like fictional books I think you'd really like An Acceptable Time. This book is very imaginative and also has a really good story, but it's also sad in some parts. This book has risk, love and sadness, but it's also very good. I highly recommend it."
3,Lemme get a word in,"Theres some much explanation to the story, you can practically think its non-fiction! It was pretty good, something I kept on reading, and no one continues to read a book if it's dull. I really like how she thought love between people are drawn in lines, all connected. Original. I guess my favorite part would have to be when Polly goes swimming in her pool against her grandparents wishes, and finds a necklace that takes her back through time. Who knew your house could be placed on historical ground. Anyway, good book, needed s'more love in it ^_^, other than that it was good."
3,this book is pretty good,"Polly, a teen aged girl, goes to her grandparent's house for a while to learn about space and time travel. There she lives at her grandparents house. She goes out one morning and she suddenly gets taken back 3000 years and a group of men are coming towards her with spears. They do not hurt her, and after a couple of minutes, she is warped back to her original time. A girl from 3000 years ago came to polly's time and had been doing for quite a while. Polly finds herselfstuck in an odd situation and finds she plays an important role in time.This book is pretty good, but it is not fast moving and sometimes boring. The book has extremely excellent descriptive properties. The book is based on the Murry and O'keefe families so if you have read other books by L'engle it adds a little spice to the book. it is very interesting and really makes you think, I mean, 3000 years? That's a long time to be just warpin' back to!!!"
1,An Acceptable Time,Utterly unlike the early books in the quintet. Badly and clumsily written. It is permeated with evangelical religion and biblical references.
4,"Fun, accurate and interesting.","A great look back at the roots of contemporary radio. Well written and very authentic. Fun reading for anyone who loved 50's and 60's radio. Unlike alot of radio books that whine about commerciality or become absorbed in technical data, this book never travels far from the magic of Top 40. I think Ben Fong-Torres under stated a few stations, but that's a characteristic of Top 40.....whatever YOU listened to was the best."
2,Can't use the verse.,"It's okay until someone does a better copy, but the verse is written out as if its paragraphs. I'd wait until a better copy comes along."
5,Singer Songwriter who is an original,"If you like originality and poetry in music I would suggest this CD for your collection. ""The Dutchman"" to me is one of the best songs around. I loved Cashman and West's version; but to hear it delivered by the man who wrote it is a special treat. If you enjoy originality and poetry I would recommend this CD!"
2,Advertized price falsehood:,"I was charged $8.00 more than the stated advertized price on the internet, I complained and there has been no response."
5,Fast Action Thriller-Couldn't put it down!,"I was stunned when I found out after reading the book that it was an old book that was recently republished and was Gilstrap's first book. I love his Jonathan Grave series and have read all of the books in that series. So when Nathan's Run came up on my recommended list, I thought I would give it a try. I read the whole thing in one day because I just couldn't put it down. It's a great plot and you can't wait to see what happens in the next chapter. For being written in 1994, it doesn't lose anything due to the passage of time. I highly recommend it."
2,The going-no-where running,"A 4th grade kid talking to a 12 years old kid about the 'NIGHTLINE', an adult program after 11:PM? The running of the 12 years old involved 2 stolen cars, 2 break-ins, 1 inexplanatory hitman and his questionable employer, 1 remote detective, 1 radio show hostess, several dead cops and an ending without a result. The way the 12 years old talked was no different from those adults in this book. I've tried very hard to figure out what's going on in this book, but simply could not get a clear picture. All I could remember after finished it was that the 12-year adult did two laundries during his break-ins and left gentleman's notes. The scenario is so hollow and unplausible, and the blabblings were zigzagging to nowhere. I regretted to waste couple of nights to figure it out but failed"
3,Great Book...Until the End,I would have given this 5 stars as it had all the elements that I look forward to in a great escape/on the run type novel. But the ending was surprisingly abrupt. I felt there should have been some sort of epilog or at least a few words regarding the other characters that played imortant roles in the story.
4,American History for teens.,"American History book written for preteens and early teenagers. Short segments about some of the more important ships in American History. Columbus's ships, La Salle's Griffin, Drake, Blackbeard, Mayflower, Bonhomme Richard, Constitution, Salem Merchant Ships, Packet Ships, Nantucket Whaling Ships, Clipper Ships, Early Steamers, Mississippi Steam Ships, Ironclads, Ocean Going Steamers, The Maine. The book doesn't cover the 20th century. A short book for short attention spans. Can be read in a sitting or two"
1,Bad trip to Motown,"Only highlight is ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" by Dina Ross & The Supremes. The cartoon voices pale in comparison to the orginals.Thought I might find a couple nice takes the kids might like, but they just agreed never to play this again."
2,The ups and downs,"I either ordered this pot either last year, or the year before. So, at most, we've only had it for 1 1/2 years. It seemed to good to be true. It's wonderful to have a non-breakable teapot with a very nice tea infuser. However, the metal interior started flaking off and began appearing in our tea. This just didn't seem healthy (to drink cast iron bits), so we chucked it. I was hoping that this teapot would last and last, but in actuality, it lasted just the same as a porcelian pot. For all those who like the teapot now, hopefully you will not experience the same phenomena as we did - flaked iron in your tea after little more than a year."
4,Great Deal,This is my first cast iron tea pot and it is really a great one! It was a gift from my boyfriend and I gotta say I don't know what tea drinker wouldn't like such a gift. This is very easy to clean and looks great on my stove top. It takes a while to heat up but the tea stays warm for a very long time within the tea pot. Not very heavy and carries just enough water for 2 tea drinkers who like seconds. I really wish it came with a little metal thingy that you set tea pots on though(forgot what they are called) you can buy them separately so it's all good.I was in a tea pot store the other day and found one that was VERY similar to this one for 60 dollars so this is a pretty good bargain folks!
5,beyond pleased,I had look many places for a cast iron teapot of this size. The price was great and so is the teapot. Keeps the tea hot while it is brewing. Very nice quality. I am very pleased.
5,Marva Bush....a Rising Star in the Literary World,"Uplifting, funny, entertaining. Myself as well as most of my friends could identify with Kate's obsession! Helps us laugh a little at ourselves and the antics we all have pulled in our youth....that we wouldn't want our children to know about!"
2,A boring scattered mess.,"I only watched this movie because of the above review. I must say this movie was a mess. It dealt with the coming out of two gay brothers...and it did so with the stereotypical gay flamer that I'd hope that was passé. This movie tried so hard to be funny..in the end there was nothing funny about it. There are too many characters e.g. Aunt Luciana, the grandmother, the woman at work...in the end all these characters thrown in for comedic effect fell flat.I can not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,I Loved the Book,"The book begins with a glossy 8x10 picture of life. Claire has her family, her children, her marriage and her career and, theneverything falls apart. She is booted out of her home, her husband wants a divorce and she looses custody of her children who were her life.Barbara Delinsky identifies each character in such a way a reader cannot but feel like he/she really knows each person. I had feelings for each character and felt sorry, happy,angry and even love for each of the characters at one time or another during the story.In the end, each character finds his or her strengths and understandings of the situation they were in and become emotionally healthy again. Scars are left in everyone's life but pain does not stop life from going on.I highly recommend the book for anyone who likes love stories, stories about life's struggles and triumps or books about surviving life's tragic surprises."
3,Thank you for your prompt service,"The book was as described, but, was smaller in size than I expected. I suppose because of the publish date, it was the typical size for a biography, at least from that publisher."
1,Poor quality,This is about the worst quality CD I have ever purchased. The song titles do not match the recordings. The song Angel Band is so scratchy as to be unlistenable. Indian War Whoop is screwed up badly.
2,MORE OF AN IMPULSE PURCHASE FOR ME,"I regretted buying this after listening to it once. I haven't listened to it since and that's about three months ago. Simply put, without the movie to provide a context, the music itself doesn't sell itself. There are four cuts of 'I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow"", two by the same artists which goes a long way to proving my point. I haven't seen the movie in a few years and I'm sure there's a logical reason for the song being repeated in the soundtrack that many times, but I can't remember what it is. Sometimes I like roots music with clear acoustic instrumental sounds and soulful voices. But as for an introduction to this type of music for a general listener, this is not the CD to get. It's mostly for the already converted."
5,Simply great,"Two things here.1. If you don't like ""old"" country music, Don't even think about it.2. If all else buy it for the song ""Man of Constant Sorrow""."
4,O Brother,"Especially loved the uniqueness of the movie, so we wanted the music. It is refreshing and a pleasure to listen to."
5,Outrageously great!,"I really loved Oh Brother Where Art Thou? besides being a very entertainingly funny movie, the music was more than amazing."
4,One of the few good things that came from the south.,"This music is as beautiful and haunting as it is deep and meaningful. If you're bothering to take the time to read this, I won't waste your time. Simply put, if you're sick of The Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Jay Z, and all the manufactured [stuff] that record studios are pumping into the publics' viens, pick this album up right now! I don't usually listen to this bluegrass/soul kind of music, but it's a welcome break from everything else that's ""HOT"" right now. Just do yourself a favor and pick it up with an open mind."
5,One Of A Kind,"This CD was spectacular! I purchased this for myself and months later for a Mothers Day present for my mother. She was thrilled. She said that this is her favorite CD of the day.The music on this CD will take you back to a time when thoughts and emotions where expressed through music. Bards of old, come to life and give the listener a feeling of comfort and empathy. Modern music can't compare with music that told a story of life."
1,I Guess I Disagree,"I had very high expectations for this CD, and it didn't come close to living up to any of them. In addition to there being almost a complete lack of emotion coming through the songs, the production on this CD is the worst I've heard in a long long time. Vocals are lost on one track, instruments are buried on the next... This may be an attempt to recreate a 1930's sound, but the music sounds like it's coming through an old AM radio. All that's missing are the pops and crackles associated with vinyl. In this day and age, I'm sure the feel could have been recreated without sacrificing the sound quality. Come to think of it, maybe the bad production contributed to the lack of emotion. In a nutshell, I haven't been this disappointed in a purchase in a long time. If you insist on buying it, try to get a listen to it first."
5,Great music even if bluegrass isn't your favorite genre,"I am by no means a bluegrass or country music fan, but the music on this soundtrack consists of some of the most beautiful pieces I have ever heard. The music is a tremendously important part of the movie, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" When I'd heard people say this, I thought for sure I would hate the movie because I wouldn't like the music. This music has such a mellow, enduring quality that reaches all musical tastes. The soundtrack certainly does not lack variety. There are 4 different versions of the ""Man of Constant Sorrow,"" which is the track that most would be familiar with from the movie previews. Each version possesses unique qualities that almost make it sound like an entirely new song! Bottom line, this is great music, regardless of your taste. Give it a try!!"
5,More along these lines,"If you are new to bluegrass, and you liked this recording, try some stuff by the Country Gentlemen. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Just a great CD,"I haven't seen the movie -- YET! However, I bought this CD because I am a great fan of bluegrass, gospel, old time folk music. This CD has roots. I think no matter what your background is, where you come from, the music on this CD brings back memories, or should, anyway. I especially love Alison Kraus' ""Down in the River to Pray"". I've not heard a more beautiful version of that song ever. Gillian Welch and Alison do a wonderful job on ""I'll Fly Away"". ""Angel Band"" needs no reviews; the Stanley brothers do an amazing job on that cut. The Whites, The Cox Family, Emmylou Harris, Dan Tyminski, Norman Blake, are all superb on this soundtrack. Bluegrass rules, most of us know that but I believe this CD is going to help those who have not had an appreciation for this music to have a new outlook on the music that really shaped America. Whether or not you have seen the film, the soundtrack will take you back in time."
1,What a waste of paper,"This book is an absolute waste of paper. The writer admits to never having had enough money to get a kitchen with drawers, I guess that's because she advises you to go out and buy something, preferably a spa product, every time you feel fat. So, fat is the same as sad/down/frustrated, and the one meaningful thing to lift your spirits is getting a new nail polish or face mask. Also, domestic staff is always female, no doubt about that, and should speak the same language you do. I am going to go and hit my head against the wall now.If your only aspiration in life is to spend all your time dusting and wiping down open shelves filled with your fat-frustration-bought face masks and hair treatments (yes, the author recommends open shelves for all your face masks, because they look pretty, and when you're down, you should wipe the shelves, because it calms you down), this book might be right for you!"
4,Repels Deer,"I wanted a deer repellent that was nontoxic and didn't rely on predator urine. After reading test results of various products, I tried Deer Off. It does work - we have herds of deer that come through my suburban yard, and it saved my hosta flowers this year (deer ate every single one before I got Deer Off). The problem is that I have to remember to keep a supply of it onhand, because if I don't use it every six weeks or so, it eventually wears off. It can also be hard on your sprayer. The handles broke on the two spray bottles I used, so I started using a pump sprayer. I have to filter the concentrate, because it can clog the sprayer with little bits. I combine it with some liquid kelp and fertilize the plants at the same time.I don't know about squirrels or rabbits, because even though we have them, they don't cause much damage to my shade garden."
4,A page turner.,Starts off kind of slow but really draws you in. I wish the ending was a little different. It was an exciting read.
4,Suspense minus romance great Thriller,This kept me guessing to the end! This started out a little tooslow and typical but really picked up after that! I was hoping she had some more books out that I could read. Anne Frasier is an Author to keep our eyes on!
3,Not really the best thriller I have read,"I had read many wonderful reveiws of this book, so was eagerly anticipating it, only to be disappointed. I thought the story was far too predictable, and a bit trite. The only thing different about the plot was the killer's M.O. which was shocking, but not very imaginative in my opinion. I really like being on the edge of my 'seat' when I read a thriller, and this book didn't do that for me. Maybe I have just read far too many thrillers in my lifetime, but my feelings about this book are lukewarm at best."
4,Great read.,I really enjoyed this mystery. It kept me involved right to the very last page. She is a good writer and look forward to reading more of her work.
5,Don't put this one down till it's finished!,"It's great to read such a page-turner by a new author. Hush kept me enthralled till this last word. I usually stay away from psychological thrillers, but this book had a lot more going for it than most. Keep up the good work, Anne Frasier!"
1,Did not like.,I started reading this and could not continue. I was far too graffic for me.I only read the first chapter and it seemed to course .Not my style.
2,Weak attempt. Skim it at best.,This book had a very weak premise. There is no logical reason to have a former victim join the police task force as an investigator and of course she saves the day and catches the bad guy in the end. The book also has a lot of needless talk of the lead detective's home live and it just waters down the book more.
4,Not Worth all five stars.,James Joyce's work is obviously a great piece of literature but for today's youth it is not the best novel to recapture the desire to read. I think it's a wonderful book to study in an English course but also I found it extremely difficult for one to read out of pleasure with the exception of the die hard Joyce fans. If you have some time to kill and also have the desire to higher you're learning then I suggest this book but if you're looking for an enjoyable rainy day read look somewhere else.
2,Religious dribble for those with lots of spare time,"Maybe I don't understand Joyce's style or use of religion in this work, but I found this work totally dull and bloated. There's nothing that I hate more than a religous/spiritual epiphany."
5,A Question,"""A Portrait of the Artist"" is too good to need my praise, or anyone else's. That doesn't mean that everyone will like it. It's hard. The ""ordinary reader"" might have the sense that s/he's not getting as much out of it as there is to get. (Actually, even the best reader in the world will fail to get everything that's in the book. That's part of the beauty and magic of Joyce.) The question is: why do people who realize that their reading skills are not adequate to the book, respond by blaming the book? I don't understand a great deal of Einstein's work, but I don't respond by calling it boring or stupid. (By the way, if you tried to read the book but had trouble, the best thing to do is get some help -- there are lots of good guides to JJ's work.) I'm not saying that you have to pretend to enjoy the book even if you really don't. I'm just saying that if you can't appreciate the book, (1) it's not the book's fault, and (2) it's not something to be proud of, or to brag about."
3,Portrait of an Aspiring Young Boy who Turns Into an Artist,"Well, to begin with, I chose this book because I had seen a lot of reviews which said that the book was good. When I started this book for an independent school project, I didn't understand it at all. I had to read the first chapter twice to sort of know what it was that Joyce was talking about. I have to admit, the book does have some good points, but mostly, it is very hard to understand. I liked the fact that Stephen (the character), who was very religious, repented of his first sin, but you have to admit, who would spend all his time in church trying to be absolved of their sins? All in all, this is a fairly good book, but I have read better ones."
1,Duplicate,"Same asThe James Joyce Collection: Ulysses, Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Chamber Music, Exiles (Halcyon Classics)and one other. This is spamming!"
1,Largely unintelligible.,"Cut straight to the chase here: I tried really hard, I really did. But after a while I couldn't read more than a sentence without losing concentration, and then noticing half a page later that I had no idea what was going on.It's painfully dull, and frustratingly difficult. I thought it was alright at first, but before you realise it, your man Stephen Dedalus is 16 or something, and then he may be older, but you've no idea when it happened.I enjoyed all the guilt he was feeling at visiting pros, and the five page description of hell (or more), and in the end it was a real shame that I had to stop reading it. I was almost 300 pages in, and just realised there was absolutely no point in continuing since it was sending me to sleep, but I was so close to the end!So anyway, there it is. I didn't want to slag it off, but if I can't get through it there's nothing more I can do."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"What a painful read. I'm just glad it's over. One of the most confusing, meandering, pointless books I've ever read. I can't see why this is considered great literature. Seriously. The language is complicated, archaic, filled with references to political figures in Ireland that are unrecognizable. And boring. Extremely boring. About the only interesting part in the whole book is the long sermon on hell given by the Jesuits, and the authors internal struggle about going to confession to be forgiven for fornication. Other than that, this is the most pointless, overly complex waste of paper I've ever picked up."
2,the title tells it all. dont waste your time.,stephen dedalus must be the most boring artist in the whole world
3,"Worth reading, but not the most enjoyable classic I've read lately","As I read this book, I tried to keep in mind how innovative it must have been when published. But I couldn't fight the fact that I just didn't enjoy it all that much. As Joyce's semi-autobiographical protagonist (Stephen Dedalus) matures throughout the novel, and the narrator's voice matures with him, the story became more interesting for me, and so its final events and dialogue were what I liked best. But as a young Dedalus observes family members argue about religion and then ponders religion for himself ad nauseum, I was bored. His arguments and exploration of poets and literary devices were entertaining, as was his consideration of and desire for women, but that's about all I got out of this book."
1,If you want to keep your sanity......,DON'T READ THIS BOOK. It's the equivalent of a teenager ranting for hours upon hours in third person. Can it get worse? Just burn it.
5,excelente,ray ban es la mejor linea de luxotica en lentes de sol y cosmeticos que por excelencia utilizo 100% confianza
1,a failed attempt to save grace,"Only if you are curious of non-essentials about Ayn Rand and her background, read this book for leisure.If you are a critical thinker or looking for information to further advance your knowledge on Ayn Rand's ideas or Objectivism, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK, it will bring you a lot of pain, because the author spent tremendous efforts and lines asserting unsupported psychological evaluations and judgements on Ayn Rand and events, which only damages the credibility of the book.This book is an attempt to save Brandens' grace after they were denounciated by Ayn Rand as cheaters and liars. The book is a revenge to a dead woman, who had a love affair with the author's first husband for over ten years, but with the author's full consent. Based on the author's own account and contrary to the explanation given in this book, one can see clearly that Ayn Rand was not far from truth in her indictment on Brandens."
4,a very funny book,"I read this book when it was first published, and I pointed out its existence to a young Objectivist manning a table of Objectivist/ Rand literature in an open space at York University. He called the book ""a pack of half-backed lies"". Well, it does read like a novel, a novel by Iris Murdoch, say, in which intelligent and very serious people do very silly, very stupid, and sometimes evil things. All the while these oh-so-serious people are rationalizing madly--while keeping up a facade of the sort of respectability that they affect to despise. It's a very funny book, and it's a real feat for an author to make even the death of the main character an occasion for stinging satire (you see, Rand had ""reasoned"" that the allegations of a link between lung cancer and smoking were a collectivist plot. . .). N. Branden's Judgment Day adds more information, and his version of the slapping scene is as funny as B. Branden's version, but generally he's not as good a writer as his ex-wife."
3,Tender but grainy feeling meat,"The blades do what your teeth don't have to....chew the meat. It does make tough meat much more tender, but the texture of the meat becomes very unusual. It does NOT turn any cut of meat into the butter soft texture of Filet Mignon. I am totally worn out after the 5 minutes of hard work it takes to tenderize a cut of steak....I prefer to pay more for better meat than to Jaccard a cheap cut...When I was a chef in a steak house in Scottsdale, we used a liquid enzyme tenderizer which gave us the butter soft steaks I love to eat."
3,Hope I believe in what it says........,"I have read almost every readers' reviews before buying the three books of Mr George Anderson. Now I have only finished reading 1/3 of the books and am comfort by the messages. HOPE that what written in the books are real deal! If it is real, it is really great to meet all our loved one in the afterlife when our time on earth end."
5,GEORGE ANDERSON--I LOVE YOU!!! Kristina Panek,"I am very lucky to have heard about your books during my time of need. My mother was the world to me, and when she past on, I had so many doubts about what happens. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for enriching my soul with hope and support. I gather from your books that your heart is made of gold and you are very generous with your gift. Maybe that is why you were given it!!! The best of luck and love to you, George, for all the long hours of support you give others everyday."
1,Deceived,How easy are people deceived they rather believe this book than the bible he says there is no hell funny Jesus talks about hell in the bible in Mathew 25 Jesus says these shall go into everlasting fire so I don't know who was giving George Anderson the visions but they were not from Jesus his books are full of errors and are of the devil.
2,Great concert - awful DVD,"I bought this DVD to update a really bad bootleg DVD of the same show. I have dozens of Jeff Beck concert DVDs. This is an important documentary of a significant period (Jennifer Batten / Who Else Tour), obviously professionally filmed, but the DVD quality is AWFUL. A previous reviewer commented on the out-of-synch problems that don't get resolved until 21 minutes into the concert. In addition, my original bootleg has more complete intro into the first track, has no synch problems, does not have spelling mistakes in the menu, and probably cost less. The producers of this DVD should be banned from selling at Amazon unless they totally re-edit this product and send replacement DVDs to all who have purchased this DVD. My recommendation......wait for a better version to appear. You want this concert, but NOT this DVD."
4,No sophmore slump for the Virginia Prince,"With his second CD, Trey Songz has recieved a lot of negative critisicm from fans for trying to be a R&B thug. Granted Trey did change his style up a tad but his lush vocals are still there. Trey's first single Wonder Woman never really caught on and it is one of the weaker songs on the CD, however his second single the lush and heartfelt Can't Help But Wait is one of Trey's stronger vocals. Mr. Songz also pulled a page from the R.Kelly song book on the sexuall charged tracks Role Play, No Clothes On, Sex Fo Yo Stero and the Pied Piper penned Grub On. My favorite song on the CD would be Store Run which is sentimental with a postive message. All in all a fine album from a underrated singer."
2,Save your money,"As mentioned elsewhere Fooled Around and Fell in Love is chopped up, down to the Top 40 radio station version. I bought this just for this song and was very disappointed. I dont know why they would even put that version on a CD. Wish I would have read the reviews first. As far as anything else on here, I think you'd need to be a die hard Alvin Bishop fan to like much of it. I know some of it will grow on me over time, although its not going to get played much since I bought a different CD with the full length version of the song I wanted. Lame"
5,Empowering!,"Fight Back and Win was amazing! Gloria Allred is such an amazing and inspiring woman. After reading this book I have walked away with a heightened sense of pride of being a woman. This book made me realise all the things I have allowed men to get away with in my life but now I feel empowered, and will not accept any kind of inappropriate behaviour from men again. Thanks Gloria!!"
3,Your very own Late Late Late Show,"When I worked a late swing shift, I'd get home around 2am and flip the channels to find a movie that would entertain without requiring any deep thinking. A bonus would be recognizing a now-old actor (e.g., Frank Gorshin) in a younger role.I no longer work swing, but occasionally desire some light-weight noir. This set fills the bill. Great for plane travel or any waiting room situation.Story lines are standard. Shadow Man had the twist of being set in England. Portland Expose had Frank Gorshin play a great hood. Arson Inc. was on the hokey side but still entertaining. The only one that struck out for me was They Were So Young. Maybe because I can't picture Raymond Burr as any other character than Perry Mason.The special features are weak. It seems they clipped the ending credits which was irritating."
3,Light start to self improvement,"As far as self improvement books go, I suppose this one is also stating the obvious and what we already know. The writing isn't great, it's not terribly sophisticated, but that allows any level reader to understand its points.I think her personal stories are a valuable asset and worth looking at. After all, if someone born into a title, and once married to a prince, can struggle with these life issues, certainly an ""average"" person can too - and overcome them."
4,Entertaining detective tales but unrealistic background,"While waiting for the spies from Moscow to show their hand, Tommy and Tuppence, aka Mr & Mrs Beresford, took over a detective agency known to be associated with the Moscow spies and masqueraded as the real owner Mr Blunt and staff. A fair number of legitimate cases unrelated to the spies came their way, and the two played the game by pretending to be famous fictious detectives, including Father Brown (creation of GK Chesterton) and Sherlock Holmes (creation of Arthur Conan Doyle). They solved the cases with more than an element of fun, typical husband-wife oneupmanship, female intuition etc.While entertaining, the backdrop of the detective agency being a Trojan horse for counter-intelligence was rather naive and unrealistic. It presumed the Russians did not know the faces of the English traitors they recruited, and once the trap was exposed, they would prefer to spring it rather than leave it alone."
4,In the beginning,"Tommy & Tuppence Beresford take over a detective agency for Scotland Yard, and delve into a variety of mysteries, domestic and international. With almost every adventure, Christie users other literary detectives as inspirations for the Beresfords to solve crimes, including her own Hercule Poirot. I haven't read Christie in ages, and it was a delight to do so again. Her plotting is marvelous. My favorite thing about Agatha Christie's works is her ability to portray human nature in all its details, thereby providing clues to motives. I learn a lot from her books!"
1,Discrepancies about Specs -- problem with rebates,"I bought the MG19VT in Sept 05. It was advertised at that time to have response time of 8ms. The user manual shows it to be 25ms. Here it is now advertised as 16ms. Interesting. I emailed X2gen when this problem came up and they sent me a ""revised"" page for my manual which showed the response time to be 8ms. Yeah, right.For a monitor with no DVI and very little adjustment, it might have been worth what I paid IF I HAD RECEIVED THE $75 REBATE. The rebate is sent to an address which leads you to believe it is going directly to the manufacturer -- X2gen. But X2gen says the rebate is handled by none other than Onrebate.com -- and they won't send my rebate. So if you want this monitor, be prepared to pay full price -- don't expect Onrebate.com to send your rebate. And by the way, my monitor has about 30 dead pixels."
2,"Product nice, Dog won't wear.","Although the goggles were very well made, my dog refused to wear them. I bought them for bike rides with my dog but they never were used."
3,A few gems on this strange CD,Noel Redding bass player for Jimi Hendrix from 1966 to 1969 was also a handy songwriter.This CD contains a few examples of them. At 40 minutes it's not a good value CD with about 25 minutes of actual rare material.Experience Hendrix LLC had this CD only available on their web site for over a year and at last is available through retailers.This CD is only for Hendrix fanatics.
2,Narcissistic mike-licking effort,"I was a huge fan of the ""Negatif"" album. However, on this latest effort, Biolay appears to have caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, and caught the terrible disease good-looking men must beware of: the romance of the self-reflection. The songs appear to have been breathed into the tracks. Seriously. The idea of sexy music, especially in the French way, has more to do with attitude and non-chalance. In this record, I am aware, as a listener, that Biolay finds himself attractive and that is somehow interesting. No, that is not. The lyrics have the touchy-feely, morose tone of the Rimbaud-wannabe dissafected suburban (French) teenager, dumped by his girlfriend after he misbehaves at her family's bourgeois dinner function. I bought this record, full of expectation, to listen to wanking vocals. Thanks but no thanks!!!"
1,"Leather??? Excuse me....more like Pleather, or worse...!!","As I see this online product I purchased, Mac Motion Leather Recliner, touting ""Saddle Leather"", as displayed and described, as supple saddle ""top-grade leather"" I sit here looking at my just delivered Mac Motion Chair....and as I pull the pieces out of the box, I grimace and think to myself.....""Leather??"", this is vinyl Pleather at best, no leather smell, vinyl feel.....I examine it closer, the zip covers pulled backed reveal man-made pleather and the filling is so cheap, I am so dissapointed.....Tell me I am wrong, but this is just plain cheap.

3,SO WHY GIVE A DREAM COME TRUE 3 STARS?,"Boy, I have no complaints about the selection and abundance of material here. Who could ask for more? There is one rather big thing wrong with it: the sound on the mono edition. It was not mastered with the greatest of care as there is a considerable amount of `rumble' and bass thumping. However, I re-dubbed it using an equalizer (on to normal bias cassette for authenticity sake) and got all of that noise out. It sounded so authentic, it would get you flashbacks to an old record player. Perfect. It was the best thing I've heard in a while....."
1,Didn't grow on me,"I can't name one song here I thought was great it was all very generic for that time period. The commercials in between songs also gets annoying....fast. Pass on this one, The Who have much better albums."
2,Make this the last Who cd you purchase.,"Don't get me wrong. I am a huge Who fan and already have my tickets to their concert in Tampa in September. That said, with a couple of exceptions, this cd in my humble opinion is mostly silly junk. I guess I just don't get it.There are a lot better Who cds' for sale and I would recommend that you buy any of them before you get this one."
4,"Coming close to Heaven! (Around Armenia City, probably)","This revised version is like having a bonus cd for the original. The Who Sell Out already was my favorite Who album, but I think the new part is almost better! But there is a ""but"". The old part sounds very different to the original version -in a very bad way. It has lost an I- don't- know- what emotional quality and effect provided by the sound engineering, the reverberation... etc., so it doesn't, I don't know, make me feel like before. Something was lost. The remix downgraded a five star album to a four star, but only for those who have heard the disc before. If this is the first time you hear the album, you would like to give it six stars!"
3,"Don't shoot me, I haven't listened to it a lot yet.","The Who Sell Out is one of those albums that make you wish you could give half-stars. Four seems like a bit much, three seems like not enough (You may have noticed that I generally don't give out 5-star reviews).I just recently bought Sell Out (selected because I simply had to have an album featuring Roger Daltrey in a bathtub full of baked beans), on the advice of a sibling who assured me I'd dig The Who. On first listen, I wanted to punish said sibling severely. Everything sounded too poppy and cherubic. Then I listened again.Whatever songs I might have lukewarms feelings for are far outweighed by the goodness of ""Armenia"", ""I Can See For Miles"", ""Melancholia"", ""Jaquar"", and their sharp send-up of ""Hall of the Mountain King"". I'm gonna have to listen more before I could give a higher rating, but I like what I hear so far."
1,Too long...not like the pic I had ordered,"The pic that I ordered showed a knee length half slip. Instead I received 3 long half slips from Her Room. I cannot use the long half slips and I sent them back.Also, I had bought them with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and couldn't find where to apply that, so the cost was put on my visa.Thanks.Jeanne Allen"
2,Very Dissapointed,"I bought the first 2 and enjoyed them. They advertize,""This set will scare you to death"". They bored me to death. I think there was 1 decent one. They are mostly killer thrillers. There was nothing HORROR about them. It should be HORROR FEST.Get it? Don't just take a bunch of crappy old movies and put them together for the sake of selling them. I am reluctant to buy next year's horror fest. You let us down, big time."
1,"Static, Crackle, Pop","I thought I knew what to expect from almost any FM transmitter: mediocre sound quality, some interference here and there, and overall just an OK music experience. But this device even exceeded those expectations... and not in a good way.I like the design and the fact that it charges your iPod. I like the LCD display and that it's backlit. On the surface, the device has many good things going for it.However, when you actually try and play your music on it, you find that the quality of the music is poor. There's static, crackling, and popping (just like my title says! =D) And not only that but if your cigarette lighter is too far from the radio, it degrades the quality even more.Kinda makes me wish that cassette players still came in cars so I could just play it through that..."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE SOME REVIEWS ARE VERY GOOD BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT I FOUND A NOT GOOD PRODUCT, A LOT OF STATIC AND LOW VOLUME ALSO A LOT OF INTERFERENCE ALL THE TIME. HOPE SOMEONE INVENTS A GOOD FM TRANSMITTER FOR IPHONE.ITS BETTER TO USE AUX INPUT WITH A DIRECT AUDIO CABLE."
4,Does the job!,"I've had this transmitter about two years now and just recently it began to only really work in one side of speakers. This could be due to how often it has been used (almost every day) and the way it sits in the car (hanging down, putting stress on the wire). It was a great deal for the price and I'm thinking of just replacing it with another one for full sound again.I loved that it charged the device and it was always pretty easy to find a station to tune to (though for long travel this was a little bit more difficult)."
4,A tremendous Blues-Rock Album,"I really don't care what the critics said about how King spent the 70s as a mediocre Blues-Rock artist; these songs don't lie. Listen to the 2 live cuts broadcast on Texas radio in 1976. This was my first Freddy or Freddie King CD (he changed his name during his career) and is still my favorite. I agree it is much more Blues than Rock, but certainly gives us a glimpse as to what he was capable of; sadly, King died in December of 1976 of a heart attack. Enjoy this CD and turn it up as loud enough so King can hear you up in Blues Heaven"
1,Please change descrition,I bought this as a large print book for my mother-in-law who has trouble with her vision.This is NOT large printShe did enjoy the story
3,Good Deed Gone Wrong,"The life of Ridley Jones is dramatically altered when she performs a random act of heroism. Through a quirk of fate, she saves a small child from certain death, has her photo taken, in the act, by a news photograhper who just happens to be on the scene, has her picture plastered on the front page of the New York Post, and as a result discovers that her entire life is based on a web of lies. (Talk about serendipity!)Of course, there are the requisite supporting players....the ex-boyfriend, the new stud, the grizzled cop, and those who want the truth kept quiet. Don't want to give away the entire plotline, so suffice to say that it's a good read for a rainy afternoon."
1,junk,"Breathless narrative of silly plot (adolescent fantasy premise: what if I am not who I think I am? what if I was found on the doorstep by my parents?)Pathetic lack of character development (could be that I just read Zadie Smith's ""On Beauty""--which has more character development in a single paragraph than this whole book--but if you're thinking I'm a snob, I also just reread Michael Connelly's Black Ice--Harry Bosch is a masterpiece)East Village depiction is not bad in an NYU undergrad sort of way."
2,Don't read if you're looking for a thriller!,"I am perplexed by the good reviews this book is getting. As a thriller, this book gets 0 stars. You can see every plot twist coming from the beginning. The only reason I kept reading was that I thought that perhaps there would be a major twist at the end that would shake everything up and make it worthwhile, but no.There are a few instances of inspired writing, but these are diluted by the repetition of the idea until it's just annoying.If you want to read a novel about a woman's search for her identity, then it's fine. Just don't expect any brilliant surprises."
1,"Like, I totally, Like, HATED this book...","What a waste of money and time. I cannot believe that this book is on any best-seller list. From the first chapter I should have known to put it down. All the rhetorical questions Ridley asks makes me want to throttle her. ""Like you know what I mean?"" I actually SKIPPED 100 pages in the middle of the book, and didn't miss a beat with the story. The entrie book sounds like it is coming from a 7th grader writing a note to her BFF in class. The ""heroine"" reminds me of Alicia Sliverstone's character in the movie ""Clueless"".Save yourself the misery."
5,Sleepy & Satisfied in Savannah,I absolutely had to read this in two sittings! I couldn't get enough. I purchased the book expecting a twerty lifestyle which may have been why I was not disappointed in the girlish lingo. Just enough romance to remind the married of falling in lust and love!Very pleased to find that I can reunite with Ridley sooner than later in Sliver of Truth!
2,"Waste of time , utterly predictable","That said, I still wanted to finish it. It was redundant and poorly edited. I cannot understand how certain books make it to the best seller list."
1,Awful,"This book is written very badly.Every sentence has the words ""like, you know, like, OMG etc etc""Waste of money."
1,waste of time,"i hated this book, i finished it only under the circumstances of boredom. I can't believe this book made top book lists, who are these people?!!!!The author's style of writing is very adolescent and annoying. The plot was predictable so therefore the book dragged out when this book could probably have been a short story. The narrator kept on directing rhetorical questions to the reader which really put me off about the book as well. All the ""philosophical"" or thought provoking comments ridden throughout the book shouldn't be new ideas to anyone who has ever had any deep thoughts about anything.Don't waste your time picking up this book."
1,Disappointed,"I thought I would love this book. I eagerly awaited its arrival from my book club. I was so disappointed. The premise seemed so promising but instead, I found the book predictable and unbelievable at times. The strangest feeling I had was that I didn't like ANY of the characters and that's a first for me. I didn't care if any of them were in danger. None of them were likable -- especially the heroine and her hunky boyfriend. I had to force myself to finish the book hoping the whole time that it would get better. This is coming from someone who adores a good novel full of mystery and intrigue."
3,Good Stuff,The Kingston traveler is a good product. It holds all of my electronic books for my college classes. Great cost value also.
4,Data Traveler,I bought this for my husband and he is very pleased with it. I personally think the transfer speed is a bit slow but I guess I'm prejudiced. I have the Data Traveler II which is much faster. He likes it because he can carry most files with him but yet it is not too expensive if he should lose the drive.
3,Fine but doesn't support Ready Boost,It's a good enough jump drive but it doesn't have fast enough write speeds to support the Ready Boost feature in Vista.
4,Nice Flash Drive,"So far it works great. It just fits my key chain so that I can take it with me everyday, very convenient."
4,Remember John O'Hara?,"If Ernest Hemingway had written The Great Gatsby, it might have come out something like this. It's brilliantly done, to the point of making the reader uncomfortable to be ""watching"". The characters are virtually soul-less, but some of them almost grasp what's missing in their lives. For the most part, they haven't a clue what to do about it, other than to keep throwing parties and observing the strict social rules that structure their WASP existence. These are not the filthy rich of the Hamptons, but the middle-class well-off's of small town America. Full of ironies and very well-executed scenes --I've never read a better portrayal of a man slipping into inebriated blabbering anywhere. I don't know if O'Hara gets read very much anymore---but he still deserves an audience."
3,"The first view ""from the terrace""","After reading some v positive hype on this, it disappointed me. For an author only 28 years old, it has some impressive points; but I think the author's own fears and flaws are mirrored transparently. It's endless descriptions of the class system of a smallish coal mining town, the cars, the clothes, the bigotry, what each person drinks get tiresome in such a short novel. It's sort of like Sinclair Lewis' ""Babbit"" updated a decade, but lacks the cynical view of that work. It took me two tries to finish this. Years later, O'Hara wrote ""From the Terrace;"" and it's more of the same, just in a bloated form."
1,CD assistance with REA,"I bought this brand new off Amazon. The CD was BLANK, it had no files or program on it. When I called REA, they said they would send me another disk, which they never did."
5,AMAZING,Small sample sizes gives you enough to do a few project with without buying a lot of one color and not liking it. Wide variety for all your clay project!! LOVE IT!!! :)
4,Excellent Consistency,"This is a good product for sculpting fine details. It bakes hard and can be used for just about any craft. I would recommend using a separate toaster oven outdoors to bake it though, because it does contain PVC (a plastic), which you don't want in an oven used for food. Also, take care not to get it on surfaces, as it may stain."
2,Clay was a bit hard and difficult for the child to use.,"The clay was a bit hard, difficult to use and some colors were unusable. Perhaps the item was old or improperly stored."
4,very excellent product,I would recommend this product for anyone who is interested in working with polymer clay. it is exactly what it looks like in the picture. It is very soft and easy to work with for what ever your needs are. I would suggest getting a surface that is dedicated for polymer clay use because it WILL stain some surfaces. I have a plastic mat that I use it easily wipes off. I love this product it was worth it. happy crafting :)
1,Strong Odor of Formaldehyde,"I bake my own bread and this was a gift. After it's initial washing the peel emitted a strong odor of Formaldehyde. After visiting their website which vaguely addressed the smell, I emailed them asking if it contained formaldehyde. Their response only advised me to see their website and said they were certified by the ""National Sanitary Foundation""(which means nothing). ""Epicurean cutting surfaces are made up of layers of paper that are then soaked with phenolic resin and cured to create a solid sheet."" Wouldn't you know that another name for phenolic resins is phenol-formaldehyde polymer!I'm returning this item because I do not want my food in contact with toxins. I'll stick to the traditional wood peel."
3,Yet Another One - Made in China,"I bought this partly because I had read recent reviews that it was made in the USA. I am committed to supporting American businesses making quality products in favor of those companies who merely import junk from China to make a fast buck at the expense of our economy and jobs.What a disappointment. Surely, we can make battery charges in the United States of America?Can't we?What is the world coming to?I will update my review in 5 years or when this item stops working. Whichever comes sooner. It's my guess I'll be back within 24 months, judging from the usual apalling quality of Chinese products."
5,A Must Have Tool,"My first experience with Deltran's Battery Tender was back in the early 90's when I installed the quick disconnect cable (included)on my new 1992 Yamaha FJ 1200 motorcycle. Back in those days battery life for seasonally used motorcycles wasn't more the three maybe four years at best. I left the Battery Tender plugged in and connected to the cycles battery year round and as a result I got seven years out of the original battery and I only replaced it purely out of guilt. I probably could have gotten a couple of more years out of the OEM battery but felt it had served me well and was long past replacement time. Since then I have installed Deltran's Battery Tender's my 1966 Thunderbird,and two other motorcycles and have enjoyed the freedom from worrying about my battery's state of charge. Battery Tender is the way to go,hook it up,plug it in and forget it. Well worth the price. 5 STARS all day,every day."
4,works great,recommended to anyone who has batteries that aren't used but need to be kept ready for 5 more words hummmm
5,Fabulous!!!,"I love this battery charger. I own a 2004 Honda Civic that is virtually brand new and just sits in the garage because I drive a 1998 Honda Accord that belonged to my mother. The battery kept going dead and finally my repair man talked me into this battery charger, this exact name brand, etc. It is fabulous. Easy to apply. Everything about it is great and now my new battery stays new so when I want to take the car out I can without having to jump start it!!"
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome",We own a older VW Cabrio convertible that's in great condition that we keep garaged. Since we live in New Jersey it often doesn't get driven for extended periods in the winter months. This product provided the perfect solution to a chronically dead battery. Once I had it hooked up using the adapter with the eye holes (included) screwed to the battery this thing was up and running in 5 minutes. Especially nice is the the cable which runs from the charger to the battery has a coupling in it that's in a perfect spot so I can unhook it and drive away with barely opening the hood.
5,works great battery tender plus,I got it plugged it in and it charged my battery back up to full in half an hour.No problems at all.Recomend it to all.
4,Battery tender,I bought this to maintain the battery on my riding lawn mower over winter. I attached the ring terminal harness to my mower battery and connected the charger. The charger appears to function as advertised. I will judge its effectiveness based on how well the mower starts up this spring.
1,Unable to rate item,"Received a faulty battery charger, unable to rate the item. Totally disappointed after waited quite a while for the item to arrive. Item was made in china though."
5,great product,Amazon has some speedy delivery I will say that!! Couple days and it was here .. It was just as discribed and works great.Thanks Amazon for Another job well done!!
5,Must Have,Here is a must have for anyone with a battery that needs to be on a charger for extended periods of time. This is the second battery tender I've owned and they work great. I highly recommend this product.
5,Battery Tender Plus Battery Charger,This charger was recommended to me by a friend. I got it at a better price than my friend did and it's exactly what I wanted.
4,Christmas In The Nothwest 111,I really like an assotment of different Christmas Music and this CD provided that. These songs are not found anywhere else.
1,This is Ernest Hemingway???,"I am in the middle of the book and have to decide pretty soon whether to continue reading it or just throw it away. What am I reading? All I see is a bunch of aimless, seemingly privileged people spending most of their time in cafes and bars, and every page I turn has ""drink"", ""wine"", ""bottle"", ""bar"", ""cafe"", ""coffee"", ""breakfast"", ""lunch"", ""dinner"" or any word related to dipsomania, gastromania (or bulimia perhaps?) written all over. They bicker and whine about lost and purposeless relationships. What is the point???? The writing is slow, except for some parts, like when two men go fishing in Spain. Otherwise, it is tiresome, boring, almost painful, and quite frankly, of little redeemable value. Or maybe, I should just move on, hoping I get to the point where I find Hemingway's purpose in writing this book (surely, there must be other far better books written about post-WWI emotional dilemma). I'll keep my fingers crossed while I laboriously read zzzzzz...."
2,Why pay so much?,"I was an idiot, I paid full whack for an e-book that's over 80 years old when I could've downloaded it for nothing from pretty much anywhere that supplies classic books . Even if you want to support current writers and pay for your books, think before you get sucked into the Kindle price - remember, you're not getting something tangible or newly produced, you shouldn't pay the same rate as a new release or a physical book.Apart from this, the book's a challenge but worth the effort; ideally read it in conjunction with A Paris Wife by Paula Mclain"
1,Completely Boring!,I thought that this book was really boring. All that I kept thinking of was if I was near the end. I chose to read this book for my AP English 11 class during the summer and found that it was one of the worst novels that I have ever read. I saw that the most dominant aspect of this book was the incessant drinking that the characters engaged in throughout the whole story. It irritated me because all they did was drink liquor all day long. This book also should me the unhappy lives of the characters. Ugh! How boring! This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to someone.
2,Disappointed!,"After reading ""A Farewell to Arms"" for my literature class and enjoying it immensely, I decided to pick up another one of Hemingway's works. Unfortunately, I chose this one. Through most of the novel, I was bored. I felt like the characters were doing the same thing over and over again. Let's go have a drink. Now let's have dinner and walk around. Let's go drink some more. I just don't see how this novel warrants all the praise it has received."
4,The Sun Also is A Perfect Man,"What a great book. Seriously. The prose is top-notch; the characters are full, interesting, even real. There's a plot that's good and that works. I can't not recommend this book.That said, there's a lot wrong at the center of the book, and that's ignoring all the blatant bigotism and antisemitism and sexism and so on. Simply put, there's an emptiness in the book, like Hemingway would rather have his narrator observe as a perfect outsider to any problem than show any flaws in himself. It then reads almost like the perfect man complaining about how much everybody else just sucks, and no matter how good the rest of the book is, in the center it's cold.(Also, other complaints about the general message of the book, but I think I've complained enough for a four-star review)"
2,Lacks Meaning,"A meandering novel with many meaningless conversations that really don't amount to very much. There were a few high-lights - the bull-fighting scenes towards the end were, I suppose, vintage Hemingway. Also the setting at the fishing village (or vacation spot) had the beginnings of some introspection, but was not taken very far. The first one hundred pages in Paris were repetitive and bland."
2,the sun also rises,"This title is way over rated. Written by Earnest Hemingway, it is basically a story about a group of misfit alcoholics jumping from drink to drink. It is written in a narrative style that reminds me of a grade school reader. It does spend a few pages on the bull fighting fiesta in Pamplona Spain. Sorry, I cannot recommend this book at all.If you want a good book go read Virginia Wolfe (To The Lighthouse), William Faulkner (Light in August) or Thomas Mann (The Magic Mountain)."
4,A good read- but not if you're looking for action.,"I'll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory ""Old Man and the Sea"" in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn't dissapointed. It isn't a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it describes the personal relaitonships of the impotent protagonist Jake, his less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school ""in crowd"" I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn't a book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning in a book this isn't the one for you. However if you're looking for more than a casual read you won't be dissapointed. This is one of his very best."
4,Interesting read,"This book was chosen for our Book Club selection for this fall. While it's an ""easy read"", sometimes the dialogue in the text is difficult to follow. All in all, most members of our club are enjoying this classic."
3,The Sun Also Rises,"I chose to read this book for an english project. I figured it would just be the same old stupid book that you jss get to get the assignment out of the way. I soon discovered when I started reading it that I liked it and it got my attention. I'm not a person to sit down and read a book, I'd normally sleep over read but with this book that was not the case. I foind myself reading it instead of sleeping. I felt the book had a good story and showed how it was for the so called ""lost generation."" The book was very discriptive and I often pictured where the senceswere taking place. If you have time on your hands to read I would recomend reading it.P.s. the book contains many sexual references."
3,Hemingway's classic being enjoyed by my husband,"My husband had never read this classic, and is enjoying it, altho he finds it it to be about the 1920s. It is written in the first person by an author living in France and the last half of the book is about his visit to Spain during bullfighting week. My husband says he feels the ""story is dragged out"" but this known famous writer is interesting, and it's good to be acquainted with one of his most famous books. He enjoyed the author's A Moveable Feast much more because this concentrates on France in the 1920s and devotes a few chapters to Scott Fitzgerald, which made it more interesting. to him."
3,"classic Hemingway: puzzling, terse, engaging","First read in high school, this book was puzzling, shocking and had me wondering what the fuss was about; next read in my 40s when I went on a Hemingway kick, it seemed inconsequential compared to ""The Green Hills of Africa"" and especially his bullfight treatise ""Death in the Afternoon""(I was attending bullfights in Colombia at the time,intially against my better judgement, became fascinated by the extraordinarily beautiful pageantry and by the courage of the great bulls, movingly described by Hemingway).This time around, with lots of life experience to draw from, I was struck by a few glorious passages in ""The Sun Also Rises"", some of the hastily sketched characters who are much alive, and the incessant, tiresome drinking that was evidently the hallmark of that era. Read it if you are already a Hemingway fan or plan to see the recently mounted play ""The Select"" that used the novel as script."
2,lots of alcohol and meaninglessness,"As other reviews have stated, the descriptions of the characters' travels are interesting, but as we search for Hemingway's point, we are disappointed as no clear point is made. Are we to compare Lady Brett to the bullfighters? Jake Barnes and other men to steer and bulls? If meaninglessness is the point, then I suppose it was made."
4,A good example of Hemingway,"Though not as compelling as ""for whom the bell tolls"" or ""A farewell to arms"" and not as well planed as ""across the river and into the trees,"" this book represents a good begining point for understanding one of the great literary minds of the twentieth century. As Hemingway explores both what humans have lost (after the great war)and what they seek to gain. A poignant story that paints the shape of life as old Ernest envisions it. Not bad for one of his very first works."
5,An all time Classic,"I just can't believe it. Nobody has reviewed this stupendous piece of work! This book is a CLASSIC. The use of language in this book by Hemingway, I think, remains unparalleled in all his works. Sad, funny and so very homely! I have read this so many years back but it remains firmly etched in my memory. An American reporter who becomes impotent is in love with this woman with loose morals - a sort of unrequited love. The characters seem so real that after so many years it remains my all-time favorites! If Hemingway deserved his Noble prize it must for this beauty!"
3,OK book. Not his best!,"I prefer The Old Man and the Sea & For Whom the Bell Tolls. This book is about a few ex-pats and their excursion to Pamplona for the running of the bulls and subsequent bullfights, about love and unrequited love. Dated!"
4,The Sun,"Received the book used but in good condition as asked for. Will be rereading it for book group in September. We are pairing it with The Paris Wife. I, of course, have read it before, but am looking forward to enjoying it again."
3,Not Hemingways Best,"The narrator is Jake Barnes, who goes into details about the adventures of serveral of his expatriate friends including Robert Cohn. Jake is a veteran of World War I who now works as a journalist in Paris. is a rich Jewish writer who lives in Paris with girlfriend, Frances Clyne.The Sun also rises appears to emphasize the lost generation after World War I. World War I left many no longer turning towards traditional beliefs of morality, faith, and justice. instead they started to turn to a life of debauchery focusing in on drug and alcohol abuse, partying, and living in excess with very little moderation or self control. The majority of this book details the friends wondering aimlessly with no focus or control on their excesses.This book drags on and on emphasizing the aimlessness the lost generation of those affected by World War I"
1,Skillfully written but boring,"As someone who thought Old Man and the Sea and Green Hills of Africa were masterpieces, this was a huge disappointment. Hemmingways skill as a writer is evident. The plot was exceptionally boring."
2,A story about immoral alcoholics,"My main beef with this book was that no one was likable AT ALL. They were all a bunch of morally-bankrupt, selfish and snobby rich Americans who trot all over Europe satisfying their whims and drinking themselves into oblivion, all while imposing their disgusting lives on other people.(Autobiographical?) If you took out every reference to how drunk these people got, this would be a 50-page novella. You might say, ""That's what Hemingway was trying to portray"". OK, in that sense this was a powerful book because the characters' pathetic lives were so vividly impressed upon my mind. Perhaps. However, I could never recommend this novel for the very subject matter and tone of the novel. Hemingway's writing is, simply put, bizarre. He translates Spanish syntax anad phrasing into English, which results in awkward-sounding phrases and his descriptive abilities are marginal. I would pass on this one."
3,The sun also sets,"This book is over-rated. The story is emotionally painful to follow, and the characters are very difficult to sympathize with. HOWEVER, Hemingway is one of the greatest authors america has produced, and rather than formulating any opinion before reading the book, I encourage readers to give Hemingway a chance. Also a bonus from this book is that F Scott Fitgerald did most of the editing...you can see his style at work.I've been told that this book is exceedinly, almost scarily autobiographical. The characters aren't very likable, but the situations and the plot evolution are fairly realistic. Not Hemigway's best, but not his worst either."
3,boring and mundane,"After reading ""The Sun Also Rises,"" I think of how unnatural and ineffective Hemingway had sometimes been as a writer. When he is uninspired or just writing filler, his prose becomes monotonous and nearly unreadable. Brett and Cohn were the best-drawn characters while most of the others, including Jake, were nothing more than cardboards. However, the one fishing scene was absolutely vivid; there is no one better at writing about fishing than Hemingway. Oh well, he was a lot more versatile in ""A Farewell to Arms,"" which for me was his best book."
2,"BORING ""CLASSIC"". WITHOUT PACE AND EMOTION !","This book only deals about a bunch of characters' perigrination through all the pubs of Paris then Pamplona, while the main female character, BRett, dates all the men in the plot. It's an endless description of people going into a pub, ordering a vodca or wine or champagne, then going out to bed to sleep, then falling in love with each other, then taking a shower, then taking a cab, blá, blá, blá ! Horrible!"
5,I recommend you buy it,"""Punk Sandwich"" is definitely not a punk-style song. No way. It's more like a jam with violins, guitars, and occasionally some keyboards. Nothing punk about it. It's a good short song too. It's surprising how good this band is."
3,"Sweet, decent fun","Don't expect much equine accuracy in this game, but then again- what do you expect? The horse on the cover is purple!This is a very sweet game your little girl will probably love. It doesn't take up a stack of room on the computer, is easy to learn how to use and doesnt get repetitive to quickly. A must have for horse/my little pony lovers."
2,Didn't like...,"I'm all for a clean planet and do my part, but this was a little extreme for me. Please, no clothes dryers?! I teach my kids to do what they can to keep the planet clean and nice, but this was a little too over the top to me."
2,Kindle edition is terrible,"The book is great but the enormous number of typos in the Kindle edition makes it almost unreadable. i strongly recommend the book to anybody interested in the origins of psychoanalysis. However, you should do yourself a favor and buy an alternative edition."
2,I never realized superficiality could run so deep.,"If you have ever been unclear about the definition of ""stereotype"", read this book. From the deeply spiritual Indian(Waterman) to the rapacious, overbearing capitalist(Trumball Sr.), each major character was a carefully crafted melange of superficiality and blandness. The prequel to this book had all these elements but they superseded by the scientific elements. The speculative exploration of Olympus Mons could have been interesting but had to be sacrificed to make room for the broadsides at Trumball and capitalists in general. I reccomend the first. I regret my impulse buy of this one."
5,very inspiring and uplifting,"I was very inspired and learned a lot from this book, I would recomend it to anyone who wants to be enlightened and learn from a wonderful man in the faith. Its just a great book."
2,"Generic, but not painfully bad","I listened to it once and tried to forget I own it. Very plain sounding, maybe okay if you just like straightforward rock."
1,Get a life,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book, which I found to be a dull recitation of facts. The author has little interest in the artistic side of Rodgers, which is--I presume--the reason why we would want to know more about him in the first place. I have a huge shelf of musical theater books, but this one isn't going to end up there."
2,If you need to know how to do a proof QUICKLY this is not the book for you...,"I read the first 120 pages of the book and all I know how to do is to sort the statements into ""givens"" and ""goal"" and state the assumptions, put ""[insert proof here]"" next and then conclude ""therefore the goal is proven."" I had to put the book down and move on to something else since nothing anywhere in the book looks like the proofs that my professor wants me to write (econometrics proofs). Very disappointing."
5,"""Practical Guide"" Has What You Need","As someone who is always looking for the right price and a good value, I was extremely pleased with the purchase of this book. The author provides you with a wealth of detail, including prices, that will be a great resource when making the rounds of shows and antique markets. Most of all, I like the down-to-earth approach of this book. The author uses humor and plain language, which makes it enjoyable to read. Also on the plus side, the book is well-organized and easy to find what you need. To me, that means I'll be able to use it while hunting for Civil War treasures. Any reader will also appreciate the clear and well-chosen photographs. I highly recommend this book for collectors at any level of expertise."
4,Powerful view of corporate life,"An evocative description of what it's really like to work in a large, mainstream, post-war Corporation: The hidden heartbreaks and quiet agonies, mostly, though it also shows some of the positive side. This is all done through powerful stories of corporate people... like a more profound Stanley Bing. Like the previous reviewer, I too keep referring people to it, even though it's out of print. I also found it very inspiring when I wrote my history of the undertow of mainstream corporations, The Age of Heretics."
2,Left something to be desired,"Although laced with facts it posed no new ideas and a majority of the reading was difficult due to confusion on which Franklin was being refered to. the Inclusion of the letters and speaches in the back was very informitive but if you are truly interested go to the library and just look up the such for yourself. All in all i found it to just be a sophisticated report and not anything particularly new or interesting, if you are interested in this subject get the Autobiographies."
3,A Great Ride in th Tunnel of Love,"This is a very funny film based on the Broadway show with the same title. The plotconcerns Doris Day and RichardWidmark's attempts to adopt a baby. Directed by Gene Kelly, the film is a bit stagey withlong stretches of dialogue between Richard Widmark and his next door neighbor played by Gig Young becoming a bit weary at times. However, whenever Doris Day shows up onthe screen, everything seemsjust fine. She's bright bubblyand bouncy in a roll that gives her a chance to show ofher comedic talent and even gives her a chance to sing a little. The title song, TUNNEL OF LOVE is quite catchy but atune she sings at a party half way through the film titled RUNAWAY SKIDADDLE SKIDDOO isvery fine. She made a lovelyrecording of this tune for Columbia records. Buy this film. It's well worth owning.(One major complaint. The film is in black and white. Colorwould have certainly brightened the mood)"
1,Awful - Just Awful,"As a big fan of Doris Day movies - movies that my family watches over & over - read the reviews posted - and bought the VHS. Richard Widmark's acting is dreadful. Too bad he had the lead! Doris Day & Gig Young terrific as usually, but Widmark's performance was so bad it ruined what could have been a delightful movie. Every new buzz word & phrase popular at that time was in the dialogue making the scenes awful & phoney. Have seen Widmark in other films and enjoyed his performances - not sure why he bombed here. This is a Doris Day movie we will not watch again. So very, very disappointed!!"
2,its a bad read,so they added a few new people that were just plopped into the story not until almost they end of the book are they explained.
3,My Oke book #4,I haven't read it yet. I'm still on the first book. I love Janette Oke. I can relate to her stories.
2,"NOT Argento's Finest Work, ...","As a huge fan of Dario Argento, I must say that this is probably his worst film. I does have it's bright spots but not enough to save this film. I think that the idea for the film was good but the overall product was bad. The acting was atrocious, and some of the effects were totally unneccessary (i.e. the CGI sequences).To go one step further this DVD is flawed beyond belief, the dolby digital soundtrack on the WIDESCREEN side is miscued, so the music cues in late, voices do not match the lip movements.However the Pan and Scan side of the disc the soundtrack is perfectly in sync. Although I refuse to watch the Pan and Scan version of anything that was shot in widescreen, I viewed this when I found out the sound on the Widescreen side was flawed."
1,THE SUCKIEST MOVIE EVER CREATED BY MAN KIND!,"This movie was the worst peace of JUNK in the universe.Compared to this Barny looks like a masterpiece in film making!I rented this movie one time and that was far more than enough.1,the movie had the worst dubbing I have ever seen it had worse dubbing than King Kong vs. Godzilla (wich has some realy awful dubbing).2,the phantom was not deformed at all,and he thought he was a rat!I never saw the end of this film I turned it of a quarter of the way through it was that bad.Thats all I have to say on this should I say Rat of the Opera!."
2,How made this movie,"What a waste of money in producing this movie, Please, to everyone thinking about buying this title, to all Horror & suspense movies fans, I say Do not be tricked in buying this phantom movie 'cos you will be really really sorry...Believe Me...But if you like thriller & dramatic movies, then try it...I would prefer if this movie is called(The rat of the opera) or (the bloody rat)"
3,"Good Acting, Bad Movie","Julian Sands, along with supporting cast, does a great job acting. Unfortunately, the movie is almost totally a waste of time, money, and effort.The ONLY thing that saves this prodution from being a complete BOMB IS the acting.Alas, poor Mr. Argento, you couldn't quite convince this viewer that you were even somewhat sane to approach the material as you did."
1,Makes Phantom of the Mall look good!,"The Phantom? Of the Opera? Raised by rats in the sewers? Bwa-ha-ha! From the man who practically introduced Euro-Splatter to America, comes a film you'd expect from a Wes Craven/Roger Corman team-up, not to mention a Director's Daughter leading role that makes The Godfather 3 look good in comparison. I tried to laugh, but this film is so bad it passes funny and slams right into painful. If you want to see Julian Sands in a great role, just rent Warlock again. ""I am not a man. I am a rat!"" - Julian Sands, completely destroying his acting career."
2,"""I'm not a whore Faith.""","Oh Lola, yes you are....along with your piece of **** movie. There isn't much to say about this movie besides that it SUCKS. I can't really get into the story without giving away the ""twist"". The movie is boring (took an hour to pick up) and generic as well, with bad acting all around and not near enough gore/violence to give it even a little redeeming quality.All you need to know is to avoid this movie like the plague, it's down there with the worst of the After Dark films alongside Nightmare Man. Go check out Borderlands or Frontiers instead."
3,Review of Gardner's 'Wreckage of Agathon',"I appreciated the detailed and politically critical vision of ancient Sparta. However, Gardner's writing was hampered by numerous instances of 'modern English'. It ruins the aura of the novel to have characters shout out modern swearwords, or use modern turns of phrase and clichés. I was also displeased with the imbalance of chapters, some rather short, others much longer."
3,Yogi Orange Spice,I buy yogi teas often and I like all but this orange spice is somewhat weak flavor than I expected.
3,Color is not as expected,"I received the ""sage"" 4-pocket organizer and canvas folding bin as a gift and I was disappointed with the color -- it's a bit more minty-green, much brighter than the photo. I know it's hard to represent accurate color on the web (I do it for a living), but they really should not have named it ""sage"" in the first place. I also wish there were more color choices than these. Off-white, pale yellow or lavender would have been great choices.On a positive note, the quality seems good and the embroidery is cute."
2,"Some very good pointers, but overall could be better.","This book contains some useful insights about dating, such as manners and ettiqite. The emphasis on respect is truly commendable. Many useful suggestions about places and times for dates are made. However, the book seems to look at dating as an exact science. This method works fine if you are discussing a business deal, but it has it's shortcomings when applied to dating."
4,"Solid good, but not much more","This book is not insightful, not really funny, and sometimes (rarely, fortunately) author gets a little annoying. But overall, good, right, has some useful information and clues for almost anyone."
3,Nice small book of common sense advice.,"A cute miniature book with advice for people who are about to go on to the dating scene. It has a lot of common sense advice, and a nice small gift to give to buddies."
1,price?,"Normally these murder mystery games were under $50... sometimes even under $30 but this one is more than $200!Sorry, but what makes this one worth 5 times more than the other in the series?"
4,Practical with excellent concepts,"This is a great book, one of the best I've read so far. This book is quite practical, if you want a boost in your life, this is it. It provides several chapters of simple motivating principles for everyday life that works when applied. I am not a avid reader so I read this book when I have the time (at least one chapter per night). I have found myself rejoicing because I actually bought it. I have realized the difference in my attitude and my days are no longer bad. Get it and write your review as I am sure you will be saying more and living life more, especially love that you are living and you are in control. Go out and face the world equipped with the right attitude."
2,Too difficult to use,"We bought this for our daughter at Christmas and she was about 2 1/2 then. It was a little tough for her to use the button but we thought as she got older it would get easier. She's now nearly 3 1/2 and even though she is stronger and can insert the photos herself, the button is almost impossible to push down (even for an adult). Other people's tips to only put a couple of photos in at a time does help but if your child puts more than that in, it will likely jam - making it a frustrating toy. The pictures on the ""slides"" are nice and would help teach counting. Also nice because you could replace with your own photos. But overall, the mechanism for the camera to ""produce"" photos gets worse over time, not better. So I wouldn't recommend buying this camera unless they fix the problem."
4,Wrong Playlist,"Amazon has the wrong playlist listed for this album. Its a nice album but I ordered it specifically for one song, which clearly was not on the CD when I got it. Very, very misleading.Julie is great, though, even when you get songs you didn't expect.Christopher Budd"
4,good sampler,"Ok this isnt ""The Best of Eric Burdon And The Animals. However it is a good sampler from the 1966-1968 lineup. It contains HARD to find cuts from ""Every One Of Us"" ""Animalism"" and ""love Is"" The sound quality is very good. It isnt perfect,(edit part 2 of sky pilot included not full song) Anyway for the money its a deal."
5,"Good toy line ('Take Along Thomas'), this one is also a must to complete collection","This toy is based on one of the earlier shows of Thomas and Friends. I happened to grab a dvd of it for my 6-year old, and then surprised to see a special toy at Amazon, so I bought this when I got the chance. As usual, I am impressed with the diecast durability of this toy line. My son cant be happier in having one more Thomas that he associates to one specific TV episode.There's a liquid inside the coach, which Thomas pulls; it stirs especially on inclined parts of rails. Thomas's face is astounded (not smiling)."
1,New model is not like the old one.,"I ordered this mouse because I have been using it's parent mouse for over three years and I just loved it. It feels very good in the hand and I just like a smaller mouse.I was thoroughly disappointed in the button functions. The center button can not be used for a double click on this model. I love that feature and if it isn't on a mouse, I detest using it.So my drawer has ended up with yet another perfectly good mouse because they just don't bother to tell you these things in the write-ups.Other then that, I can't report on any other findings, because I put it away before I could throw it across the room.If automatic double clicking is not your thing, then I think this would be a pretty good mouse.I do love the size and feel of it in the hand during use."
4,"Excellent, While it lasted","Portable, compact, and was very reliable, until it suddently stopped working, EXACTLY one year after i bought it. But, im probably going to end up buying this one again, because it was great and cheap. But i guess you get what you pay for."
4,Works flawlessly; not good for those with huge hands,"Be informed that this mouse is 1/3 smaller than the regular mouse. It takes time getting used to the smaller size. I would only recommend this to those with small hands. Otherwise, it works flawlessly. I like the thinner cord, too."
3,optical notebook mouse,Its a nice piece of equipment but it would have been even better if the profile contained details like the chord winds around the mouse and the size of the mouse is smaller than the regular mouse.
4,Great mouse,"This is actually my second Logitech Optical Notebook Mouse Plus. The first one failed due to wear and tear. I found that if you wrap the cord around the mouse a lot, as it's designed to do, it can wear out the wire. I now just click the USB connector into the mouse without wrapping the cord and it works great!"
1,"Great idea, poorly built","Winding the wiring around the mouse is a great idea for storage; however the wire is so poorly made, it broke within a year. USB mouse began only working sometimes then by wiggling the wire the mouse would begin to work again. Didn't take long after that for the mouse to quit working completely. If you purchase this item I would recommend not wrapping the cable around the mouse."
4,This is a good buy,This is pretty good for its price. Perfect for laptops. I've been using it for more than a year and it still works well. It's worth the purchase. :)
2,don't buy it,I bought this mouse a few months back. It was working fine in the begining then it started ti give trouble. You have to place it in a certain position for it to work. I works sometimes and doesn't work other times. don't waste your money.
1,dumb desing features,"It can't be that hard to design a mouse, but...- the cord is so short that it only works if there's a USB port on the right side of your laptop(e.g., not my MacBook Pro)- unless you're very careful, when you wind up the cord around the mouse there's not quite enough wire to click the USB connector into the detent that's supposed to hold itOtherwise it's fine."
2,Stopped working after a few months,"I see that a few other users also had this failure issue after a few months. Very strange, worked great for a few months...I thought i had a winner after using several other products that failed. This one no longer works after a few months. Help! Can anyone recommend a notebook mouse that I can depend on?"
4,Great easy-listening Spanish guitar,"As with the other Spanish guitar CD I reviewed, this one serves its purpose well. My wife is bilingual and lived in Spain for many years. She wanted some easy-listening Spanish guitar for background and mood music, so I gave this to her for Valentine's Day. She loves it (and I don't mind listening to it, either!)."
3,Adhesive wears off pretty quickly,"The tray was cheap and served its purpose well for a few weeks but eventually the adhesive wore off and it fell off my (plaster) wall. Granted the wall has an uneven kind of plastering (not stucco, but it's not totally flat). Anyway it's definitely something to keep in mind when purchasing the tray."
2,Doesn't fit s602z,"Bought this because the picture looked a lot like the smaller, square cable which fits my FinePix s602z. it didn't! they sent the regular usb-mini-b 4 pin that is slightly larger and has rounded corners. the picture clearly may be wrong. be careful!"
3,"Not Bad, But Could Be Better","For once I wish the producers of this adaptation of ""4.50 From Paddington"" could have been a little more faithful to Christie's story. Instead, they brought back David Horovitcch to portray the irritating Detective Inspector Slack. Detective Inspector Dermot Craddock from ""A Murder Is Announced"" was the main investigator from the novel. They also included David Waller to portray a Chief Inspector Duckham, who was never in the novel. Instead of following Christie's portrayal of the ""love triangle"" between Lucy Eyelesbarrow, Cedric Crackenthorpe and Bryan Eastley; they decided to settle matters by having Lucy fall in love with the infantile Bryan, and transforming Cedric into an oozing ladies' man who tries to hit on Lucy every chance he can. The photography, which was never that hot to begin with, seemed to have faded with time.But despite these flaws, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the story."
5,Excellent book,One of the most excellent books I have read till date. Very insightful information; I never realized the significance of correspondence by women in the Romantic era till I read this book. Must read for every student of Romanticism.
5,One Sweet Voice,"This cd has all of my faverite songs. I have herd them done by many. But this lady can really sing her heart out! Betty Johnson's voice is the culmination of the best voices of all times. There are quite a few other albums I have enjoyed as much as The Take Five Sessons. Her music just lets your mind drift and relaxes your soul while you listen. Each CD is a vacation from lifes stress. Betty Johnson I thank you for the quick getaways, No packing and easy on the budget.Another one of your adoring fansSteve Briere"
4,We Got A Great Big Convoy Rocking Through The Nigh,"I Love C.W.McCall his music is so much fun and at the same time he has a seriouse side there are some classics on here like Convoy(natch),Silvertone,Old Home Fill'er up and Keep on Truckin Cafe and AutobaunC.W.McCall Rules"
1,Want to see James Bond taking himself seriously?,"I think most people like this movie because it's BEAUTIFUL.Yes, male and female models dressed in gorgeous outfits (sometimes naked) drive outrageously expensive cars, they live in urban luxury or take a break at the Jamaican villa (owned by one of them), talk about true llove, art and megabucks. It's all VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL! Anyone wants to be in their shoes for a couple of hours.But what does it have to do with the moviemaking in the levels from Kent cigarette commercials and up? The movie too artificial to resemble the real life and to pass for a caper it's lacking that twinkle, the tongue in a cheek quality of the genre's masterpieces.It seems that most commercially successful James Bond wants to be taken seriously. It's known that Mr. Brosnan is of a rather humble origin - there is nothing wrong with that, I am not a British Lord myself - but that explains a lot.What we see is a mega-budget home movie of the leading actor who is also a producer."
1,soulless nasty tripe!,"A totally vacuous piece of hollywood nastyness. Brosnan and Russo have about as much charisma as pieces of lettuce. Rene tries desperately to be sexy and alluring but fails dismally. Urrrggghh...the worst Hollywood has to offer. The whole thing plays like a homage to greed and emptiness - see our intrepid cardboard cut outs slumming it in luxurious appartments eating oysters and taking joyrides in Helicopters. Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying I dissaprove of the greed as such but couldn't you at least have fun with it? Rent the original instead, at least that had some flair to it. Avoid!!!!!!!!!"
4,LOVE this movie,This movie is excellent. Piece Brosnan is one of my favorite actors and he was fantastic with Rene Russo. Loved it!
1,I wish someone had stolen the show.,"i have never wanted to walk out on a film until now. i would have had not my wife wanted to see it. i found the premeis of the movie interesting, but it completly failed to grip. after the first 10 minutes the action is over and the rest of the movie is a predictable and dull cat and mouse game that means nothing because it is so predictable. many of the situations are ridiculas and the script is lacking. if you have a desperate need to see this then i recommend watching the original."
4,Good movie......BUT.....,"Yeah, it was an entertaining movie. But I just want to say that Rene Russo is a withering old broad, and seeing her wrinkled body half-naked was QUITE the turn-off. AND I hope she reads this!"
4,"Brosnan, not Bond","manymanymany people have told me,""Thomas Crown Affair wasn't very good, there was no killing, or big explosions, what were they thinking when they made a movie without that! "" iam the biggest bond fan in the world, and the character bond has it's ups and it's downs, a major down is , once your bond, your always bond. Pierce Brosnan can't do a nonbond movie without everyone thinking he's bond. NO Thomas Crown Affair wasn't packed full of stunts and explosions and catch phrashes, but it was an extremely smart, and a great movie. Brosnan was in Mrs. Doubtfire before bond REMEMBER: Brosnan is not Bond there is a difference."
4,They Have Us Rooting For The Crooks Again!,"I found this to be a pretty solid re-make of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway film of the early '70s. Actually, a lot of people thought this version was a lot more interesting and entertaining.This '99 re-make was more of a thinking man's crime movie that one normally sees these days in which violence and profanity are way overdone so many times. However, this movie is far from ""family entertainment, "" not with Rene Russo baring her breasts a few times, just to give one example.Here's too, another case of the film world making the criminals the good guy and the police as someone to root against. Neither of the two leads has an ounce of integrity....but we are manipulated into rooting for them.For nostalgia buffs, the let Dunaway play a small role in here, as a psychiatrist."
3,Broken Crowne,"...I liked how the movie used New York city as a luxurious backdrop and let the viewer get a real feeling of our unique city, I also liked Brosnan's portrayal of a bored loner with a gift for theft. I didn't like Russo who made me cringe everytime I saw how horribly thin she was inspite of the beautiful clothes she was dressed in. I had seen her 'In The Line of Fire' and liked her performance. In this movie she looks hard, hungry and gaunt - as for Dunaway's facelift everytime she was on screen I couldn't help but stare at her noticeably higher 'left eye'.I had planned on getting the original movie, but I read that the picture quality was lacking. However, after reading the reviews about the performances of Dunaway and McQueen, and seeing the preview that is attached to this DVD, I think I'll get a better feel of what the story should have been.Jewison, Dunaway, McQueen - the original Crowne might be gold that I thought I found."
4,What a fun flick!,"A sly little caper, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is visually lush, adventurous fun, with a strong performance by Rene Russo as the hard-shelled insurance investigator chasing Pierce Brosnan's suave art thief. Faye Dunaway contributes an amusing cameo (she played the Russo role in the original film with Steve McQueen), and the music and art direction are outstanding. ""Thomas Crown"" is light Friday-night entertainment that you just might want to watch again (and again!)."
4,smart and entertaining,"I would definitely see this movie again. It was a pleasant surprise among the usual drab scenarios. It is a clever little mind puzzle, but not too heavy for a Friday night."
3,we need a little fluff sometimes,"I enjoyed this movie, because it was nice to view some movie fluff for a change. Also seeing mature characters enjoying seduction and romance made this movie very enjoyable. Another twenty something female teamed with an over forty something male would have been would have been too predictable and boring. The psychological undertone which ran through out the movie, was the issue of trust. One of my favorite lines is when Renee Russo's character states that her lack of committed relationships is due to men making women ""too messy"". An interesting response to sum up feelings of trust in twenty five words or less."
2,Why Did They Remake This?,"I remember the original and I thought it was a C+ movie but nothing else. This version had good casting and the initial art museum scene was fun. Beyond that, I was bored. It was like a two hour movie of ""Lifestyles Of The Rich and Famous"" interupted by a few nude scenes of Rene Russo."
3,Very stylish but with little substance,"Although Mr. Brosnan's and Ms. Russo's performances are credible and the direction is commendable the script is lacking. And that's not to say that I wasn't suprised by the ending... I certainly was but the romance was staid, predictable and without real contrast or energy.It's worth viewing just don't expect much more than some picturesque scenery and clever thievery."
4,Liked it!,"I thought this movie was full of action but also had a logic plot: something almost unheard of in action movies, especially when you compare it to movies like MI-2. The actors were right for the part and the whole product was incredibly entertaining. It is a movie worth watching. I have watched it myself 3 times."
2,disappointing double vision,i received two 1968 versions of the movie and no 1999 version. tried contacting the vendor but got no response. slightly sad.
3,If this had no middle it would be great.,"This movie starts out with a very cool premise. I enjoyed the first few scenes of the movie, but as the ""plot"" went on and the movie progressed it got more and more borring. Up until a fairly neat sequence at the end that was rather surprising and a tad silly. The borring middle was not helped by Pierce's continual mumbling. I'll say again that this movie has some neat sections, but at times it was so borring I got up to go do the dishes. I would rent it, but not buy it."
4,An unexpected surprise,"I saw this movie expecting a cheesy overacted James Bond ripoff. How surprised was I to find a clever, well acted and sexy film. Brosnan and Russo have fantastic chemistry and the story has been updated nicely from the original.Dunaway even makes a cameo appearance as Brosnan's therapist. One of the most clever features of the DVD is its imaginative menu screen which replicates the interior of an art museum. As the camera pans around, the various impressionistic paintings are actually scenes from the film that come to life as the camera moves around them.The DVD also contains the trailers from both the original with Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen as well as the remake."
1,LOW VOLUME,"Dear users,I was thrilled with the option of getting my hands on a pair of the renowned Sennheiser PC-66 headphones, but before ordering, I researched the internet and found once and again that the volume was very low using the USB connection even at maximum settings. As a thorough buyer I emailed Sennheiser tech support regarding this problem before buying and they replied that it was a non issue and that I would have no problems.Well I did have problems and even after tweaking everything that can be tweaked the volume is inappropriately low to listen to music pleasurably.I had to return the headsets to the retailer and lose $20 attributed to re-stocking fees. I did inform Sennheiset regarding the deceptive information and they really have ducked the issue.Don't buy these headphones."
2,Ok but didnt last very long,"Build Quality is terrible, the microphone stopped working within a few weeks. There are better options."
5,Works like no other!,I have used other brands of headsets in the past and these by far are the best. I have found no discomfort in wearing them and the sound quality is great.
3,Incomplete,"Any Brook Benton cd is incomplete without ""Just A Matter of Time"" on it. ""Rainy Night In Georgia"" is his staple, ""JAMOT"" is essential to Brook Benton cd's. Curb your wallet on this one."
1,A Kid's party is had by none. The only one blue was my son.,"My 4 year old loves Blue, but found this product complicated and cumbersome. The company needs to get a clue about young children. This was at about a 10 year old level. The idea is great but the execution was lacking. Overpriced and not as good as the oher Blue's Clues products that I have seen."
4,Nice Pictures and Interesting for Car Lovers,"My twelve-year-old son reads this book constantly. He is not a big fan of reading but likes this book because he loves to think about what kind of car he is going to get when he is 16. I hate to break it to him that he is most certainly not getting any of the cars in this book! There are detailed pictures and descriptions of the cars. Not my idea of GREAT reading, but for a car lover I am sure it would be a nice gift."
1,Be aware!,"I bought this ""remaster"" version hoping that the sound quality would be better than on the original polydor recording. The sound is just about identical as it is very hard to hear any kind of difference (the original sounds in fact ""Deeper""). What hurts the most is that many tracks are in fact shorter than on the original album. I gave one star because the artwork is different from the original cover and that makes it interesting for the one who wants ""to collect"" anything from the band. I spent a little over five dollars buying it from movie mars through amazon.com If you really want ""the right version"" of this album, try to find the polydor recording. There are some great remastered versions of Purple albums in the market but this one is a disappointment. I see it as a cheap reissue. Be aware!Jean-Jacques"
3,strong mainstream dance rock! PURPLE STILL RULES,"Ian gillan is back again, Mark II/V line up is still ruling and battling! a Must for Purple fans! Dead or alive is timeless,...this one is alittle bit better than Perfect strangers 1985. Deep purple plays any musical direction....."
3,A good reunion era 1986,"I personally love this one better than Perfect strangers,...hard Rock album,..they did come back in the Rock n roll scene 80's"
3,"Average, but, it is Deep Purple's best line-up!","Agree with the fan from Md, but, Call of the Wild has always been one of my favorite Purple tunes! Also, the tour was great right after Perfect Strangers. I was just happy to locate this one!"
2,Deep Purple overstating themselves...,"Compared with their famous 1984 reunion album,powerful and very inspired,'THBL'lacks a certain spaciousness in sound,actually there are too many layers of sound allowing for clutter and overkill.While there are a few decent tracks ,there's too much filler on this record which still benefited from the momentum of 'Perfect Strangers'."
3,It's worth a listen,"There seems to be mixed attitudes about this one, but I do believe there are many likeable songs on here, including Bad Attitude, The Unwritten Law and Call of the Wind. Not among the best, that's for sure, but if you don't believe it could possibly get worse than this, I dare you to listen to a few Purple albums from the late 90s and 2000s. Real heavy metal has always been dark and angry, and I've always associated DP with those bands. But there are a handful of upbeat songs on here with a style that you would normally associate with bands like AC/DC. I listened to Hard Lovin' Woman and it made me feel like (whoa!)!!! Many of these tunes can make one feel strenuously orgasmic, so be warned. Orgasmic, but not cheesy like some other bands, so adopting a slightly different musical direction is not necessarily a bad thing. If you like the classic dark angry metal better, then I recommend Perfect Strangers over this, but this one's still worthy of some credit."
5,Outstanding Clapton!,I wrote to the Fidelity Sound Lab in 1981 maybe early in 82 requesting this recording be added to their catalog and got the usual reponse; a catalog! Well hot damn; looky what I found on the net! If you like EC and want to hear that wah pedal and Strat in the hands of the tonal master again get this CD! OH HAPPY DAY! Am I a Clapton nut or what?
3,It's sooooooooooooo scary!!!!!!!!,"Corky can't get over the death of Bobbi. Soon, the evil is back. Corky knows it must be one of the cheerleaders. She is back on the team when the accidents start to happen. Then Corky and her boyfriend, Chip, meet a weird girl. Accidents are back, then murders again. Who is the evil? Find out!![....]"
4,Mary Driscoll is coming to America to live with her Aunt.,"This book was okay, but others have been better. Mary Driscoll's parents (native to Ireland) have decided to send her to America to escape the famine going on. Mary does go, and lives with her sister who went 4 years ago and her Aunt. She works in a mill. She makes some friends with the girls who work there. I don't like the epilouge though, it sais she dies when she is 17. Otherwise it's a good book."
2,Not enough to get A,"I thoroughly read this book twice and took the accompanying exams a few times until I was able to answer most of the questions correctly. There were, however, so many questions in the actual CLEP exam that were not included in this book. I ended up scoring 53 and received grade C from my college. If you just want to pass the exam, this book may be adequate. But if you want to get a very good score, you also need to read a college textbook and study properly."
1,A MAJOR Disappointment,"As a long term fan of the Dummies books, I can't begin to express my disappointment in this offering. Scanners for Dummies is so exceptionally elementary as to offer absolutely nothing beyond how to ""push a button"" or ""move a slider."" Nothing is presented that couldn't be discovered by simply turning on the scanner and playing with it for a half hour or so.The worst part, however, is that much of the information about scanners and Paint Shop Pro is misleading and in several cases, just plain wrong. This is the absolute worst Dummies book I have ever read and, while it is not my first one by Mark Chambers, it may well be my last."
2,"dissapointing, perhaps for beginners","I found this book overanalyzed, making the aiming process quite complex (opposite as it should be). Even though the AIMING section of the book offers some good stuff, I'll suggest that you take the time to read it only if you find yourself having REAL trouble pocketing balls.Personally, I found myself focusing too much on technicalities rather than making my aiming process the easygoing part of my game.You might find most of the subjects easier explained and far more understandable in other books.Perhaps this book is better intended for beginners, and it would be a good idea to make a notice on the book."
1,Oh dear!!,"This book should come with a pair of long floppy shoes and a red nose, because if you think it really will answer your prayers you will feel like a clown once you've read it. As a snooker coach I like to keep up with any new ideas but i was extremely dissapointed with this book's overcomplication of aiming.Save your money spend half an hour pocketing long straight diagonal shots and you will learn more than this book will teach you about your aiming. Also because of throw the true angle of a shot is not the point on the object ball farthest from the pocket. The only way to get accurate is to look at each shot see where the object ball has to go to make a clean entry get down with the object balls line of travel in mind and when you are sure your going to send it there shoot.Trust yourself. If you have played for any length of time your subconscious will know the right angle. You could perhaps balance Kranickis book on your head as you stroke, its the only way it will help you!!"
4,A good deal for some required songs.,"The current price made this a good time for me to buy this CD. My main goal was finding a digital copy of LOVER PLEASE by Clyde McPhatter. I think that Clyde had a great, unique, soulful voice. Yes it helps to have a forward moving, hand-clapping rhythm to sing along with. Talk about unique rhythms, the drums in COLD SWEAT by James Brown deserve yet another close listen by all. Not crazy about the song, but Jerry Butler is another absolutely unbeatable voice in whatever he sings."
5,Tony's masterpiece!!!!!!,"This is a must have cd for ANY guitar player!The melodic heights Tony acends with this type of neoclassical shred genre is very impressive!!It so good ,after I heard I went out to get other TM cds and was dissapointed that they did not come close to this high standard.The vocal and majestic sound is wonderful.He is not the fastest shreder,but does let loose at times.Deen Castronovo plays on most of the songs does a masterful job on the drums.This cd still sounds Great today!"
2,So what?,"When I was an aspiring guitarist in my teens I pretty much looked solely to speed merchants for inspiration. A short while after I moved on as my tastes grew more diverse. Recently, I've dug up some of my old shred albums, including this one. Unfortunately they don't stand the test of time that well, particularly the neo-classical noodlings of Malmsteen, Moore and MacAlpine. In fact they sound downright one dimensional and unmemorable compared to great players from other genres. I've chosen to comment on 'Maximum Security' as it's regarded by most fans as TM's best neo-classical album . Gifted technician as TM is, I'm afraid he's the type of shredder that provokes the 'So what?' view from non-guitar freaks. I will admit his CAB work is more interesting although he's occasionally prone to throwing in shreds of metal."
2,Disappionting bargin bin experience,"This album was originally released in the late '80s. I'm a fan of the Strange Cargo albums, so I was excited to find this in a bargin bin circa 1992. Unfortunately, only one track (""Swamp Dog"") is instrumental. I don't have anything against lyrics or singing but I didn't find anything here worth keeping. The bit of singing on his ""Hello, Waveforms"" album is much better. I passed this CD along to a Pawn Shop or CD store pretty quickly. Listening to the clips now, I can tell that some of the tracks have also shown up on Strange Cargo albums as instrumentals."
4,watch seiko szzc42,it is a nice watch with a good price on amazon compared to those in the department store
