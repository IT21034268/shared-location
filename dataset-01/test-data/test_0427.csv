3,Small and Loud,"See the little vent upfront? That's the little space the humidifier tries to push air through. When it is set to high, it gets quite noisy, and is distracting at night when trying to go to sleep. When set to low, it does not work well, at least in my 20x20 bedroom. I would not recommend buying this for anything rooms 12x12. If noise is a concern, I would not get this. Look for another Vicks that has a larger vent on top."
1,Bad Smell Bad Design,"My husband purchased this unit right after our baby was born. I used it right away, at first I really liked the unit. It was quiet, and worked really well. Then after about 3 weeks I noticed an odor. When I looked at the filter it was already discolored, looked like hard water stains and Mold! definitely NOT what i wanted around my infant. DO NOT buy!!"
1,Thought we ordered the one without a wick filter,As far as I can remember we ordered the one that did not require a wick filter but the one we received had a wick filter. We ordered this when our daughter was few weeks old and I guess the new parent fatigue kicked in when we ordered this. Operating this humidifier is a no brainer but the fan does become noisy occassionally and that too on low setting. We hardly use this any more.
3,ehh....,Its okay. I wish I went with a filterless though. It also floods its drip pan all the time causing the filter to get soaked and therefore useless until it dries out for a day. Its just wet all the time and I fear mold. I have stopped using it.
5,TY Beanie Babies Diego - Go! Diego Go!,"Diego was purchased as a gift for my grandchild and was an instant hit. He's the perfect size for little hands and makes a cuddly companion for watching Dora and Diego. He was fairly priced, arrived promptly and was very well packed."
2,Quite small and not very cute.,I bought this to go along with the Rescue Pak but it wasn't as much of a hit. Wasn't really very cute.
4,Glad I got it!,"It's not expensive, but it works for me. I am glad I got it because I was tired of having sawdust all over my jeans and t-shirt. I can take off the apron after working with my saws or sanders and go inside without worrying about dropping dust everywhere. Also, the dust comes off the material easier than it does off my jeans/shirt. It has a handy pocket for a carpenter's pencil and two other pockets that I found helpful holding some screws or my tape measure. I think it is made well-enough. The material is not heavy denim or canvas, nor does the item description say that. The material is cotton, like I expected, not too heavy, not light. I think for the money, it is worth it. It might be nice to have a fancy apron but that would cost more, too.Bottom line, this is a good apron to keep the stuff off you when you work."
5,Great!!!!,Husband said they were perfect. They were exactly as described. Fit well. Now will have a lot less ruined shirts.
3,Not bad but sloppy and lazy,"This isn't a bad collection but:- The editing is weak: Mark Twain's comment about leaving Jane Austen out of a great library appears twice (with different wording)- Many quotes aren't traced back to their source (the authors frequently used ""attrib."" or quote from someone else's collection of quotes)- In both the Movie/Television section and the Music section, 20% of the quotes come from a single person- Not all the quotes are, in fact, reviews. The pieces from Robert Bentchley, for instance, are quotes from one of his books"
1,Evictor,"I purchased this item because of the great reviews. We installed two of these strobe lights in our attic and they have not made one iota of difference in the squirrel invasion. I believe the animals are hiding under the insulation. Two days ago, one finally scratched its way through the drywall ceiling of our bathroom.We are ready to tear the roof off the house to get rid of them.Hopefully we can return these lights and get a refund.M"
1,Evictor,I installed two of these strobe lights and they did absolutely not bother my squirrels at all.I would not trust any review that said it worked.M
2,Still have critters,For the price I would expect it to work a lot better than it has. We still have critters. :(
4,Top rated Bigfoot book,"I view with amusement the semi-critical reviews below, whocomplain that certain chapters are too ""far out"" for them.I 100% support Powell, since I am a person who had the VERY SAME EVENTS HAPPEN TO ME. The critics are not experienced.I am - 28 years. I run the Bigfoot Investigation Project and we find similar events monthly, some in person.This book is one of the top two books from the last 20 years.Buy this book!!!!! Now!Bar none.Jon-Erik Beckjord, http://www.bigfoot.org"
5,The Elephant in My Living Room,"I read the book before I attended a seminar taught by Ms. Renner. The Elephant in My Living Room helped me identify my own ""elephant."" While I was never sexually abused as Renner was, I learned that I did, indeed, have an elephant in my house. I thank her for sharing both her story and her faith. She offers help for anyone through faith in Jesus Christ."
4,Steamy!,"I absolutely adore Nicole Jordan's writing. I read this series in reverse order, and I have to say Master of Temptation was my favorite of them all. The story certainly got off with a *Bang* as our main characters sealed the deal in the prologue! It was a nice change from cookie cutter romances in that the attraction was immediate without any of the drawn out chasing and wooing into bed. With that out of the way, the falling in love aspect was more real (for me anyway). There were many wonderful and colorful characters in this tale of secret agents, adventure, and intrigue. Both our leads were strong, smart and fearless. The ""money"" scenes were quite well done and very steamy. All in all this was a very well rounded book. Nicely done and highly recommended."
2,Lovemaking? I Think Not!,"Writing numerous sex scenes does not generate stirring romance reading. Nicole Jordan's newest novel MASTER OF TEMPTATION is saturated with stimulated descriptions, but what it does not have is the desire, the lust, the titillation that creates a good story. In other words, sex does not equal romance.I have found Nicole Jordan is a hot and cold writer; you never know what her books will provide. This talented author either electrifies you with her inspiration or leaves you cold with her neglect.MASTER OF TEMPTATION is the first novel in Jordan's newest series, ""Guardians of the Sword."" A group of men and women who champion against evil and keep the world safe (Kinley MacGregor fans take notice). For part two in this ensemble, I plan to visit the library.MaryGrace Meloche."
3,This book was totally not up to Nicole Jordan's standards.,"I have loved every Nicole Jordan book I have read. The sex scenes were so inventive and sizzling - that is what set N.J. apart from the norm. This book really disappointed in that regard. Until about page 300, the sex scenes were really tame and not at all in N.J.'s usual style. Once I hit about page 300, the sensuality started to pick up a bit.The whole subplot in this was much more involved than I liked. I like the story to be 99.9% about the characters and their romance and the rest about a tangent storyline. This subplot really took up too much of the story and I found myself skipping whole pages at a time.Overall, it was a good read and I would recommend it for someone who prefers intensive subplots and tame sex scenes. Not bad, but not great either."
3,My Opinion of Shinbone Alley,"Shinbone Alley is a good movie, but to me there is way to much singing."
3,Groovy!,"This book is a well written mystery about a San Francisco police officer tracking down a serial killer while simultaneously keeping a crazed colleague from head bashing hippies, because, yes, it is set during the *summer of love,* 1967. It is almost painful for me to read -- all those ideals that seemed so real at the time, and so many of them didn't work out the way we thought they would. But, hey! It is still a great story! Enjoy!"
4,getting out of jazz and went cotemporay r& b...,"this cd is great, maybe beacuse i love nancy wilson, huh? well i do love the title of the cd, other songs on here too, like early morning, my favorite winter green amd summer blue, even the remake of careless whispers, by the famous group wham. nice cd... tke a listen to the samples if u can."
3,Nancy's Keep You Satisfied,"I have Nancy's Anthologhy cd, that is a must have for her fans.I think the stand out track on this cd is her fabulouseversion of Marvin Gay's Just to keep you satisfied. Her Anthologhycd contains Come get to this and we can make it baby, so I had tohave this cd to complete the set as she handles Marvin's materialas if it was written for her."
1,"Fine Collection of unusual repertoire, poorly sung",Problem is that this fine singer should have recorded them 20 years earlier. She really sounds her age in the worst way. Not recommended for the average listner but certainly intertesting to singers wanting to expand their repertoire
3,It's not what I thought it would be..,"The book is well written but it was not what I wanted.I've really enjoyed books like Mark of the Grizzly.So when I got this I thought it would be sort of the same. Like I said it is well written and full of true encounters but they always end in the death of the bear by guns.I think if you are a hunter you would like this book but if you enjoy 'shooting' the bears with film I'd say don't read this one, you'll feel sad."
3,like the design,"I like the design, wish it had a cell phone pocket and that bottom pockets were slightly larger. It shrinks after a few washings and tie straps almost too short to tie after shrinking."
1,Simply Unacceptable,"Stipulated: That I considered the low price of this razor, and that it had a strong influence on my decision to buy. But, in deciding whether to purchase this razor, I also relied on the largely favorable reviews of the product. Not a Mercedes, I figured, but a good solid Civic, or perhaps a Subaru, or at least a Hyundai.NO! ... Remember Yugo? ... Could you perhaps envision the domestic competition that Yugo had to best in order to make it to the world market? Despite it's inefficiencies, as pointed out in previous reviews, despite it's noisy rattle ... Bottom line ... this shaver simply cannot give a good shave.We clear?"
4,Great Show,"Really good show. I won't spoil, but the end of the season takes quite a twist and really makes one realize how important the ones you love really should be, even if they are quirky like this family."
5,Good Service!,It was finally deliver on time! First time I ordered this product to another seller and amazon had to give me a refund because I never received it. Now it was deliver on time and in good conditions!
3,Black particles in the water,"I don't know what the black particles are in the water. Additionally, I would also like a shut off switch. If you unplug from the wall while it is on, it causes sparks. I think the edges of the opening could be a little smoother too, so when you are trying to clean the black stuff out you don't cut up your hand. It is also hard to drain. Finally, I find mine shuts off well before the water is gone. I would like it to keep running at least a little while longer. So perhaps a longer motor system would be great. However, those things aside, it seems to be working for my intended purpose. And I guess what can you expect for $12?"
2,leaves water in tank,"This worked well for a week or so. Now, it leaves over 50% of the water to sit at the bottom, causing knarly (and warm) water to sit and stops working after 4 hours. Hard to empty also- lift off the blue thing that is wet and set on the ground. The white part is the reservior and has an awkard hole at the top where you have to shake it a while to get all the water out-- even still, gross water is hard to get out."
2,Vicks vaporizer,I didn't not want a warm mist vaporizer. I didn't see that in the discription. I wanted cool mist. That is it
4,"Pretty good, does what it says","I've had one of these for several years now. I'm not sure if mine is the same model but it looks the same. I haven't had any problems with it, the unit does what it says on the package. I would say, don't place this too close to your walls unless you like water marks. My bedroom's paint is old anyway so it's not a big deal to me.I use this whenever the room seems dry. If you keep it clean and do the maintenance they recommend (cleaning with vinegar) it should last quite a while, as I said I've had mine for several years with no issues.I recently found the perfect thing for filling this too, if this is the same model I have-- an Ice Mountain large water jug fits perfect in the hole of the vaporizer when you take the ""lid"" off, and works really well for refilling. I just refill the jug with tapwater, and up-end it and the jug will sit right in the opening as the water drains out."
2,Irritating to clean & dry,"The one problem I have with this unit is that the molded plastic base (the white part) is virtually impossible to empty so it is fully dried. It is like trying to shake the last few drops out of a soda can. You need to dry it to avoid creating the environment for mold growth between uses. It could have been made to pour out the water... I don't know if this is a planned obsolescence thing, so you'll go out and get another cheap unit next season, but is irritating. Otherwise, I've had no problem using with a bit of salt and soaking in vinegar solution before drying to store."
1,It only works for about 2 hours,"I don't understand how they can advertise that this humidifier can work up to 12 hours. It runs out of water so fast. I have to get up in the middle of the night and refill it. I would say it works well for about 2 hours. So, while it is inexpensive, you get what you pay for."
1,Sent back,"I guess you get what you pay for, Maybe I had a one off but I couldn't even feel the moisture when I put my hand right by the vent."
4,Ex07b project,"Ex07b does not work (listed on pages 160-161) on Windows XP. The child window ID of stc32 (=0x045f) is not recognized by the file dialog. As the result, the buttom of ""Delete All Matching Files"" does not delete *.obj files at all."
1,disssapointed,"First that all, the trader was great. Very fast deliver, I much appreciate that. But the dvd is... boring! It shows 2 dances that are the most stronger, passionate, vibrating dances in flamenco, with no passion at all!! Very very basic!!! the farruca is mean to be a hard footwork dance.. there is no hard footwork at all! I guess it's ok if you are thinking of learn ""some"" flamenco just to play around, not to get good at it. Besides the dancer has no grace to dance at all.. very dissapointed. It probably would be ok if was rumba or even sevillanas, but not tango and farruca, wich are such hard and complex dances. I don't recommended, was a waste of money."
4,"comfy, but kind of a tight fit..","Looks great with tights or straight leg jeans, but not with wide legged pants...comfy in the legs, but a tight fit on the toes...difficult to zipper..."
1,These photos are freely available!,"I honestly don't know what to make of this product. Sites like terraserver-usa.com, maps.live.com, and maps.google.com make these very photos (and superior ones) freely and legally available to anyone who wants them. Take it from someone who's spent hours upon hours studying theme park aerial photos online over the last few years. To me, it seems like quite a ripoff to charge money for a calendar that features photos that one can simply print out of one's own computer."
1,Don't waste your money--or yout time,"I loved C.S. Friedman's other two sci-fi books and have reread them both numerous times, but The Madness Season is a real mess. Her characters are repellent, her plotting labored and turbid, and her continual lapsing into hackneyed rhetoric insupportable. I kept hoping the book would improve--after all, Friedman's work is usually brilliant--but, after slogging my way through 340-odd pages, I gave up. I pitched the book, which I almost never do.Do yourself a favor: give The Madness Season a miss."
1,I am truly sorry that I spent money on this.,It is confused and confusing. A muddle of vampire and sci fi with justice to neither.
3,we all need a little magic in our lives!,"I thought this story was very touching. It is cute without being overly sentimental and seems to be left wide open for a sequel! Pretty drawings, too."
4,does it's job,This works fine and was a good deal. the only issue i've had is that the front piece sometimes detaches and stays in the outlet when I pull it off. it's not a real problem since you just have to pull from the front instead of the side.
5,A great story/ true Thoene writing!,"In a Christian publishing market crammed with writers who only seem to be in it for the money, the books by the Thoene brothers are a wonderful and refreshing change. Brothers writing about brothers who lived in the age of Napoleon and great sea battles...what an incredible subject! The internal conflicts between the two main characters ring true. The conflicts they have in their hearts as young men reflect what we all go through. The action is superb. The dialogue and description are authentic and brought me into the time and place. I will be reading much more of Jake and Luke Thoene novels in the near future. They are truly wonderful storytellers."
3,spacing problem,i purchased this product. it had no instruction inside the box. do not know how to use it due to spacing at the end. i can leave large spaces between the patterns not like the picture. do you attach the pieces together? also does the instructions come with pictures for ideas. thanks
4,Don't stick it in the fridge!,"Need something heavy and sweaty for the summer?Krux it is!Entombed members meet Candlemass members to produce a powerful heavy DOOM metal.The album starts with some classic doom songs-some heavy, some very heavy-slows down for a ""solitude, Planet Caravan""type of song and ends with a psychedalic-hawkwind-prog-doom long trip.The production is just right for the style, not too neat, heavy but not confused.A good album for summer along with Celtic Frost, Cathedral and a 70's touch."
5,bringing back memories,"Boy, this album brought me back to my high school years. This band was awesome but really never received the credit they deserved. Balls to The Wall is absolutely the best rock anthem along with Hells Bells. I had not listened to them since high school, 20 years ago. I recently watched the movie The WRESTLER with Mickey Rourke and I couldnt believe they used Balls to the Wall. I immediately purchased a new Accept greatest hits CD."
3,It is okay,I bought this for my grandaughter to put some of my mom's ashes. The opening hole is very small and difficult to place the ashes.
3,Disappointing,"There is SOME good material in the 1200+ text pages of this book, but not nearly as much as one would think. The problem is that the author goes way, way overboard with the comparisons to the Gospel of Mark. Instead of merely highlighting important changes, this commentary spends hundreds of pages discussing each and every change, in each and every verse. Anyone with a Bible can see what has changed between the two gospels, so it is a waste of time and paper to describe each change in excrutiating detail. Like ""Only cosmetic changes differentiate Matthew's text for the first half-verse from here to Mk. 6:35"" and ""In the second half of the verse Matthew again reproduces the substance .. with only minor changes"". The author has totally missed the point: a reader wants the commentator to use his expert skill to select and describe IMPORTANT changes, not to mechanically document each and every word in which the gospels differ."
3,Good game for two or more players.,"This is a really good 2P cooperation game that's next to impossible to play by yourself. You may be better playing with someone who's the same or better experience with games as you, otherwise it can turn into a yelling match (""NO! Pull the knob! Watch out! Jump!"")."
5,Great Couples Bonding,"This game is great. My boyfrined and I were playing this game together. As other reviewers have stated, it promotes communication and teamwork. We were joking around that it is great for couple's therapy!! We wish there were more cooperative games such as this one."
4,Addictive,"For those wondering about the play of ths game that haven't seen it in the arcade or on the dreamcast, this game is simply addictive. While driving a taxi around doesn't sound too intriguing, this game provides lots of simple, addictive fun for a gamer of any age."
2,"made obsolete by GTA3, but good for the youngins","This game is a good bet for kids under the age of 14, and it is a good fast-paced scramble for passengers and money. The annoying bits are that there is no damage to your taxi when you hit ""solid"" objects, you cannot mow people down on the street, the missions are all timed, the street surface glitch is EXTREMELY annoying (sometimes the street will completely disappear, looking like glass), and the wannabee Wolfman Jack should look for another means of employment. The side missions, exp. the long jump, [are] REALLY [bad]."
4,"Returning, it's half price at CompUSA","Not a bad game; pretty fun and it's hard to really screw up (compared to driving the Laguna Course on new Gran Turismo 3!Really my only beef is that right after I bought this game, I saw it (two days ago) for $... at the local CompUSA, and they had plenty of stock. I asked; this was not a limited promotional price, but everyday for several weeks now.$..., OR $...? Heck for that price differential I'll put up with the ... CompUSA anytime..."
4,The original,"If you've never played a crazy taxi game go ahead and give this a try, but it gets old quick. If you've played 1 2 or 3, then youve played them all."
3,Fun.. for a limited time,"This was the first PS2 game I ever played and I was impressed with the graphics and sound.. at first. This isn't a game to buy, unless you can get it cheap. There are only so many things you can do in this game. Basically, you are a cab driver and you have a limited amount of time to drive people to their destinations. That's the game. As I said, it's fun for a limited time."
3,O.K.,This game is o.k. I would suggest you go with Crazy Taxi 3 (XBox) though. I don't know if Crazy Taxi 2 is on PS2 but if it is get it instead of this one. You will not regret that.This game is a pretty good game though. But still go with 2 and 3.
3,Incorrect information,"This might be a good book for the test. I just finished about one-third of the book, but I've already found quite a number of faults of the content. For example, the author seemed to mix memory address space and I/O address space together (P69). The description of ""memory-mapped I/O"" is not at all accurate. On page 45, his statement that SRAM was used in SIMM is apparently wrong. It would be better if there is a website for the errata."
1,Preview Clips Are not an Indication,"The clips above sound nice and relaxing. These tracks are NOT. Horrible, annoying music comes in later, ruining it. I mean REALLY bad. I love his Awakening and Gamma Meditation, and others, but this is one of his worst, hideous cds. Save yourself. Get his Sleepy Rain or Awakening."
2,cheap,"Very cheaply made. If I had a chance to look at one before purchasing, would not have ordered. Very small inside, and latches pop off when trying to close on a shotgun. Now that I have it I'm stuck with it. ""Get what you pay for' is true.Joe"
2,Material is too weak and flemsy to seal when closed and latched.,This case cannot be airplane safe (as advertised) because the material is not stiff enough to seal all around when closed and latched with a gun inside.
3,Its cool and...,"faster than my zipzap with a 28,000 rpm motor but it hesistates to long. Like 2 seconds i hit the trigger THEN it will move, its problly just beacause it infared..."
5,Accessible to readers of all backgrounds,"This newly revised edition of Richard C. Campbell's Two Eagles In The Sun: A Guide To U.S. Hispanic Culture is an in-depth look at Hispanic history, life, language, and traditions in America today. Written in a question-and-answer format, this wide-ranging informational guide addresses everything from ""Why is Spanish called 'the Language of the Angels'?""; to ""Why is the Virgin of Guadalupe Important to Hispanics?""; to ""What are the usual stereotypes about Hispanics?"" A first rate information source accessible to readers of all backgrounds, Two Eagles In The Sun is a highly recommended addition to community library collections and Hispanic American Studies reading lists."
2,"Oh man... so bad, it's almost funny..","Gene Simmons really has to learn not to put a KISS logo on *everything* he possibly can.. I love Video Pinball games, but KISS Pinball is just annoying. While I can (barely) live with a scrolling table area, the tables themselves are so busy it's almost blinding trying to play the game and keep track of the ball! For [$...] it's not a *huge* loss of money, but don't bother with this game unless you're a *huge* fan of the rock group whose name is emblazoned on the cover of this title, (and you're into collecting memorabilia)..."
2,Is it Mac compatible?,Are any of these cameras Mac compatible? I have A Macintosh computer and I'm looking for a digital camera that will work with it.
5,"""Every comfortable pair of shoes I own...""","Every comfortable pair of shoes I own comes from the same Danish company: ECCO. From the first day I wear a pair of new ECCO shoes until the last (many, many years later), not a blister, not a bruise, not a bunion. Just comfort and pleasure. Highly recommended."
5,I like very much,"Yes ,the product came in the right time and is very good and secured ,I was looking to buy this type of holder but I was never see one and when I saw in the amazoon I just purchase ,thanks very good."
2,Want a list of D.D.s ?,Expensive pocket book with low yield. it lists symptoms and signs with differential diagnosis for each. some have up to 75 differential diagnoses. I wonder if this can help students.... may be Specialists ! .
5,Good product,The installation instructions were perfect and it took me less than 15 minutes to connect and run the wiring on my 2005 Honda Pilot.
3,"Asi,asi","I don't know what to say about this album. Some of it is fantastic, but the rest of it is slow and pretty much the same lyrics and tune. I'm sorry to say that I did drift off somewhere in the middle of this album. I hope Jadon's next CD is more upbeat.And for those of you who don't speak spanish asi,asi means so,so."
2,Not the old Jadon Lavik.,"I have the other CD's of Jadon, and was hoping this one would be more like them, filled with the gospel and more smooth melody. But in turn it is more a Rock CD than his other Hymnal CD's. A big change for Jadon.He also repeats 2-3 songs from his previous albums and adds them to this one. I don't see why that was necessary. I am a big fan of Jadon, and am planning to sing ""Nothing but the Blood"" in my church. But this Cd's he went a little on hardcore side, and less emphasis on the gospel."
5,Simply Wonderfull,I have this on cassette tape not CD. It is one of my favorite. If you love Hollywood musicals and Johnny Mathis this is for you. It is an absolute joy to listen to Johnny Mathis sing Henry Mancini's songs. A match made in music heaven and definitely easy on the ears. You'll love this one!
5,This book is very informative and inspiring!,"I wish I had purchased this book prior to investing in my medical billing software. Rick Benzel highlighted several key factors in deciding which health service entity is right for you, and the proper steps to ensure new success. There was also a CD included, which had demos from a few billing software companies. What an asset!"
1,Unbearable,"Loved the books then the movies. I tried and tried to enjoy the recording, but just couldn't take it any more after the first two CDs of the Hobbit. The ""period music"" is absolutely horrible; sounds like nails on a chalk board (I know it is intentionally that way, but that doesn't make it good). I also just couldn't get into the character voices, they all sounded wrong and some were too similar and annoying. Gandalf sounds like some 20 year old dork rather than a wise old man. The Hobbits sound like British versions of the Chipmunks with sore throats (Alvin!!!).So overall, my problem after a couple of hours of listening was that the pitch of everything in the audio was just too annoying to my ears; it didn't sound natural."
5,tour guide,"On our two week trip, the book was always with us. Being originally from Berlin, I still needed the updates form my time. In the Rhine and Bavaria areas we just followed Rick's advise and had a great time."
2,Same old stuff from Rick Steve,Rick Steve's Germany and Austria 2006 is a barely updated version of the last edition. As usual he only travels to the 'super touristed' towns and not to any of the other lesser known areas. Obviously aimed at middle aged US tourists it is both facile and superficial. I wasted my money.There are much better travel books available.
4,Typical Rick Steves....which is a good thing,"This is the 3rd Rick Steves' European travel book I've bought. From now on, his is the first one I look for. I like the simple way the book is set up, and his tips on what to see if you don't have a lot of time."
3,a little cliche,"I ordered this book for a premarital counseling course and read it out of respect for my pastor who assigned it, but I thought it was a little cliche and boring. The authors know a lot of ""Charles""s and their scenarios seemed to fit their points a little too well...I dunno. I wasn't hugely satisfied, but if you don't mind cheesy, it's a quick read."
2,I was never to break these in.,"I bought these on clearance for about 25 dollars. I bought them half a size bigger, and I've had them for almost two years and they're still uncomfortable. They pinched my toes and the inner sole started to scrunch up and move within 6 wears.I keep them at work and try not to walk in them. They feel a little better with hose on. I've bought and returned two other pairs of Kenneth Cole shoes as I felt the leather was supremely hard. I don't buy expensive shoes normally, and Nine West is usually fine for me, these are supposed to be a step-up, but too painful. They are cute though."
5,Beginner's Review,"I had no experience with turkey calls before buying these. I bought these three because they were the same cost as buying two individual ones. I had no idea if the different styles would make much of a difference or not and I still don't know or can't tell because I'm not good enough yet and they seem about the same. It took me a couple of days to get these to make a sound. I watched a bunch of online video to help me figure out how to make a sound. The biggest help was to say the word ""he."" That activated diaphram and tickled my tounge so much I started to laugh and ended up laughing several times. That made it slightly easier for me to be able to activate these calls and I've stopped laughing. These calls are crazy loud and will greatly annoy the entire world if you aren't careful. Overall the value seemed about right and I'm really excited to get out this spring and bag a bird."
3,Turkey Calls,These are decent calls that have a nice case. They seem to be about the same quality as other calls of the same general type. Cost is close to the exact same items purchased off the shelf.
4,Cassette does exist with English subtitles,"I agree with everything James Ferguson said. Very charming and exotic movie, though not as impressive as some of Mikhailkov's other work.There is indeed a VCR cassette with English subtitles. I recommend that you write directly to the seller to ask"
4,Animal Phys Book,The book is in really good condition. I ordered it wednesday morning and had it saturday...was very impressed.
4,Another Good One,"This is probably the fifth or sixth book I have read by Tanya Huff and she is definitely an author I would highly recommend. I really liked the characters in this, especially Darvish (despite his drunkenness in the beginning). Though the growing relationship and feelings between Aaron and Darvish made me a little uncomfortable (I would rather have had Darvish lusting after Chandra instead of Aaron) I didn't let it put me off and had a hard time putting the book down in order to do the necessary everyday chores that need to be done. Tanya Huff does a wonderful job of showing what friendship and true caring is all about. I hope she does come up with a sequel to this, but if not anything else she does come up with will be very good without a doubt. You can't really go wrong with one of her books."
1,Out of Date as of 2011,"I tried to run this on my mac book pro, and all I have to say is that it is time to give up on windows xp when considering OEM unless you can get a the most recent version. I mean this thing was so out of date that it mentioned floppy disks, dial up, and other things that do not apply to most computers today. If you even try to put this on boot camp, it will not even pick up a wireless signal. IT IS USELESS AS OF 2011.....unless you are a computer wiz who gets off on stuff like that."
4,Great service but not so great Windows,"I ordered Windows XP and it arrived a lot sooner than expected. It was wrapped in its original packaging just like they said. However, after about 3 days it started to act weird. I have a Mac and am using bootcamp. So, when I would switch to Windows, a message would pop up and tell me it was unable to start Windows without a system check. Fortunately,the message stopped popping up a couple days later. I know that this isn't caused by the people I ordered Windows from; they were great! Just know that their may be errors after you install the disk."
4,Perfect for Mac with VMWare Fusion,I found all the different versions of Windows very confusing as to what would work properly (and legally) on my new MacPro while spending minimum $$. After looking at a couple of reviews here I bought this version of Windows XP along with VMWare Fusion to be able to run Street Atlas and the few other programs only available for Windows. Installation was a breeze and it works great. I haven't run any intensive applications but Street Atlas and my Garmin software run perfectly. Only four stars... after all it's still Wiindows. :-)
3,Windoz XP Home,"It's everything I expected it to be. I have applications that require XP so I have to dual boot my PC. You can not connect to both a wireless network and your LAN at the same time. You HAVE TO use only one or the other. There isn't a handy place that warns for that or provides the necessary configuration. But it is much more stable than W98 and doesn't require a restart for every change, like IP settings."
4,A75-S226 Replacement,"Works great, installs perfect, contours to the laptop just like the original. Only downside I see is it is about 1/32"" less wide than the original on each side but it has no effect on performance that I can see, it stays put once you click it in."
1,Bye bye the baby goes... It fell off cuz it dosn't have any brains yet...NOR THE CREATORS!!!!,T his is weird... It dosn't have any horse OR motor skills. It can't ride cuz it dosn't have any brains yet!!!!!!!!!
3,80% accurate isn't good enough for hikers,"I just returned from a week of hiking the Amalfi coast, with this book as my only guide. It is great in concept, but only about 80% accurate on all of the hikes we did. That's not good enough. Mr. Tippett needs to follow a hiker who does not know these trails and towns and is using his book as the only source and get it accurate. Stairways were not where they were supposed to be, distances are inaccurate, and so on."
5,Fast paced mystery-excellent book!,"Daniel J Hale and Mathew LaBrot's Red Card combines the classic mystery with an action-packed plot, creating an engaging novel that can be a positive and adventurous experience for our nation's sports-playing youth."
1,"Slow, doesn't work","The Lexmark Z55 was advertised as being very fast and easy to use. NOT TRUE! It took several tries to get the software installed, and the printer ran extremely slow, when it did print at all. It would not print at all from DOS, or from other computers on the network. Printing from a DOS program in Windows caused a Windows program to pop up and it seemed to take 'nearly forever' to print a simple directory listing. Even such a simple command as DIR>LPT1: caused the computer to crash.A tech. support call to Lexmark (NOT a toll-free number!) revealed that this is a 'brain-dead' printer that does not include the printhead driver in its on-board electronics, but instead relies on the host computer to control the printhead. So whenever you print anything, you're tying up your CPU doing what the printer is supposed to do itself!I do NOT recommend this printer unless you want to 'throw away' half your CPU speed every time you want to print!"
1,Really bad!!!!!,"This is one of the worst cds of all time. It's worse than Simon and Garfunkle's worst, and worse even than Jewel. Bob sure misses it on this one, He writes great songs, but it's too bad none of em are on this album, except ""Brownsville Girl"". These songs really are awful. Bob is the Michael Jordan of Rock, but you wouldn't know it listening to this flop!"
1,It's Stankin' Folks,"I don't like this album. With the exeption of ""Maybe Someday"" and ""Brownsville Girl"". This is not a good album. It STINKS!!!!!!!!"
1,No way Bob!,"A mustn't buy If this is the first disc of Bob's that you will own, its a lousy introduction to a great artist. Buy any other Dylan album but this. If y2k hits, Bob's discs will be better than gold. They would be the new currency, something that has a value that will never wane, even in a time of economic crisis. Sure if the power is out the disc players won't work, but someone will be savy enought to have a generater just to play Bob's music, and this man will be out King, and we will follow him. But not listening to this particular album which happens to be awful!!!!!1"
2,"One Great Song, Seven Fillers","This album would be right there with the very worst of Dylan's albums (Down in the Groove, Empire...) save for the inclusion of the fantastic Brownsville Girl which gains it a star. The rest of the selection range from catchy but vacuous (Driftin' Too Far...) to garbage. One for the hardcore fan only."
5,A GREAT DISC,"This cd oozes with vibrancy and warmth. A pleasant journey to the heart of american music, with a world renowned conducter at the wheel. Survey says: buy it, you won't regret it."
1,"Inexcusable, especially from Dylan","Seriously, this rivals Self-Portrait and Planet Waves as his alltime worst. When Dylan's lyrics are weak, that robs all purpose of listening to the music. Guess what? They're mostly weak here (Drifting too Far from the Shore; Maybe Someday; Precious Memories; Under Your Spell). Guess what else? The tunes themselves are mostly weak: no memorable melodies, no virtuoso or even good (or even crappy, for that matter) performances, nothin'. And don't even get me started on that children's choir found on They Killed Him... baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad idea. Most of these songs are cut-cut-cut-rate love songs. The exception is Brownsville Girl. His lyrics are at their best. But those booming drums, backing vocals and horns are distracting. Would've been a great solo acoustic performance.Here's one for the trash."
3,"Hardly great, but not a disaster","In 1986, everyone was very disappointed by ""Knocked Out Loaded"", including me. But time has mellowed my opinion. It has some horrible filler - Precious Memories, They Killed Him - but ""Brownsville Girl"" is a genuine five star classic, And surely any Dylan fan has to love the feeling he puts into ""Maybe Someday"" - one of his best vocal performances. ""Drifting Too Far From The Shore"" and ""Got My Mind Made Up"" are pretty good rockers as well."
5,Probably Herbert's best,"This is Herbert Grönemeyer at his most versatile. Plain rock (Chaos), a ballad (Flugzeuge), an eerie lullaby (Halt Mich), political satire (Tanzen), cabaret (Manner), it's all there. Moreover, Grönemeyer holds his own very well without electric gadgetry, and he's more than ably supported by a host of first-rate musicians and a truly great audience. Grönemeyer's chemistry with the audience is almost tangible and you can hear all of them having great fun performing great music. Recommended without reservation."
1,Do NOT buy!!!,"This is the worst NCLEX book. Do not waste your money!! It says to put a subcutaneous injection into a muscle, and also says that the male urethra is 20"" long!"
3,Beware Depth of Shade,"Firstly, the previous reviewer thought he needed a hack saw to assemble the lamp. This is not the case. The problem is the terrible instruction sheet provided by the manufacturer. Aside from being unclear, they attempt to use the same sheet over a variety of products. Confusing customers is not a good idea. I resolved my assembly issue by calling Quoizel and they were very helpful and the problem was solved.My disappointment with the lamp deals with the shallowness of the shade. It doesn't quite cover all of the bulb from certain seating positions and when looking toward the lamp from a lower seat, you look into the bulb. Of course this will not be the case for all users, but it is an issue for me and I want to alert potential buyers.The lamp does not disappoint in looks. It did come with one of the sockets loose and I feel that this is something that their final inspection should have picked up."
5,headed for the future,"i liked the album, but would anybody know in what movie the song,""THE STORY OF MY LIFE'was from. thank you"
4,neil diamond,"my sister bought this, long time fan. enjoyable pop album , had the record for years, time for the cd."
2,mom w/ coughing baby,Picked this up becasue of it's small size. Seemed to be the perfect alternative to the regular units in my son's room. It certainly makes the room smell like Vick's but you miss out on the most theraputic part of a vaporizer...the warm water vapor that fills the room. Good if you only want to smell the suff but not so great for relief. Somtimes newer isn't better.
1,Poor quality,"Everything promised in the kit arrived. However, the hook was rusty before I used it the first time and in poor condition. The plastic form started braking off in pieces along the edge after hooking about 3 rows. I was unable to finish it for these reasons. I would not buy from this company again."
5,Awesome Manual!,"This manual is great for anyone who is preparing to become ASE master certified, or for anyone who is going to take more than one automotive ASE exam. The hints in each chapter are helpful on some of the tougher questions and the practice questions really help to prepare."
2,Was nice while it ran,"Nice while it ran, but started to malfunction after about 6 months. Would no longer recognize SATA drives. Had to RMA back to Newegg."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was not as pleased with this book as I thought I would be based upon the reviews I read prior to my purchase. The messaging and the genre-based language in the book went right over my 4 year old daughter's head and I found myself having to stop and explain things on almost every page (either that or reword the text in my head before actually reading the page to her in my edited form). I enjoy using books to help expose her to new vocabulary, but in this case, it wasn't necessarily kid-friendly vocabulary and the process interrupted my reading so much that it ended up getting in the way of the actual story. Maybe she's just not the right age. I do have to say that the pictures are great; Nash is a terrific illustrator."
3,Wheres the instructions!!!!,This looks a good game and the graphics are great but the lack of instructions as to what you can actually do with this game is very dissapointing. Its trial and error as to learning what the game can do and this is not good enough in my eyes.
1,Theologically off,"I purchased this book as part of my research for a book I'm writing myself. As such, it served its purpose. However, were I reading it for its content and not to understand this spiritual warfare movement better, I would have put it down by about page 12. The statements it makes and conclusions it draws are not theologically sound. I realize there are many people in this movement, but popularity does not make for accuracy. Compare what you read here with Scripture and be discerning."
2,"Appealing title, but a little disapointing.","Vocal Arabesques is as appealing name for a CD, principally when you have already came back from some North Africa's countries and had listened to marvellous voices there. But I must confess that the CD was a little bit disapointing for me. In Algeria, Marocco and Tunisia, I could find many other singers that are much better than Aicha Redouane.I'd like to have more information at the CD's booklet to find out some other info about her."
5,GREAT,Have a Wolf bathroom and this life like guy fit right in!Perfect in size and looks.We've had it up for months and does not peel off unless you want it too.
3,Nice Idea,Good concept. But did not hold up to the test of time. Straps to hold in seats gave out. Wheels are suspect and frame has started to rust. Very sad this was not a winner.
4,GET IT!,"FOR INFANTS IN ANY CAR SEAT, THIS IS SO CONVENIENT WHEN TAKING THE TWINS TO APPOINTMENTS AND OUTIGS TO GRANDMAS!VERY STURDY AND RELIABLE."
4,great if you have parts,"Just keep in mind that old outboards are EXTREMELY difficult to find parts for. You can get the knowhow with the book, but good luck finding parts."
4,for what it does it does well....but beware,"these things make huge and I mean huge clouds of dust. They are great for long rips but be prepared to wear a respirator and not one of those cliche' cheap painters ones either I mean a cartridge type unit. But the reality is for long rips you need this unit. However for shorter rips , cross cuts get the ""Snapper Shear ss404"". They are virtually dustless. For detail work use a jigsaw with a coarse blade...see my other reviews for examples."
4,Great production..,I listen to this CD at least three times a week if not more. I find it very soothing each time I listen to it.
4,Keep it simple.,"Iwould like to say that after purchasing this scanner I was happy to find that it was indeed very simple to set up and use. I started scanning within an hour after unpacking it and encountered absolutely no problems with it at all. Also the HP scanning software that comes with it is incredibly nice with the added addition of being able to connect online and transmit your photos with the HP Photo Scanning Web site make sharing your photos fun. The scanner has worked flawlessly from the start and at the price I think you cannot beat it for value. You will have the chance to print Text, Documents, Photos, 35mm film, Slides, and 3D objects. It is my first scanner and as I have said it is very easy to use. A true prize!"
2,Difficult scanner to use,"I found the controls confusing and difficult to operate. My previous scanner was an HP 2200c. The controls on the 2200c were easy to understand and use and required only a minimum number of mouse click to scan and save. The 3570c is a great leap backwards from my previous HP scanner. If you require a transparency scanner, I would suggest getting a 3500 and add the transparency adapter as an option. With the 3570c you have to use a piece of white paper over your scanned item to prevent the transparency holder from bleeding through to your scanned image. Also, I've found that the scanner has a tendency to ""auto-crop"" certain items even when the ""auto-crop"" function is disabled. I'm getting tired of having to drag the cropping handles around just to get the entire scanned image on the screen. I've owned this scanner for approximatly 1 hour and 30 minutes, and so far, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm ready to get my old 2200c back from my daughter and put this scanner in the closet."
3,Made in China - and no good specs on slot sizes,"I was disappointed to see when I unwrapped this that it was made in China. For those of you looking to purchase something that is NOT made there...keep shopping.The width of the slots are not indicated, and as such, two of my knives will not fit in the holder. For future reference, these slots are:2 - 2"" slots4 - 1-1/2"" slots2 - 1"" slots1 - 1-3/8"" slot/steel holderThis info for ALL of the storage blocks on Amazon would be most helpful."
3,It works...but not for everything.,"I like this, it meets my need, but not my desires. My honing steel pokes out the bottom and I have no idea, which knives are supposed to go in which hole. BUT it keeps my knives protected and my fingers too!"
5,great album from a great musician,"This is a album that is music written in a ten year span from 1985 - 1995. These were songs he wrote for other performers to sing but like the album title, were ""Unborn"". The songs are top notch but if you are looking for the classic rock sound of Ambrosia, this is not the album for you. The songs are more of a soft rock/jazzy sound to them. But when I bought this album I was not looking for the Ambrosia sound but for the David Pack sound. For songs that never released because it was felt that they were not good enough is just not true. This album is great and if you like jazz/soft rock you will like the this album."
5,Love this photo album!,I absolutely love this album. The pictures slide in so easily and the memo space is great for jotting down who is in the photo or what the special event is. I bought one to start out my new daughters photos... and I bought 4 more just so I could continue with the same album.
4,Pretty good so far!,"Bought it at Target for about $32 and used it for the first time last night. I have a bad cold as we speak and for the first time, I did not wake up with a sore, dry throat. We used it on low speed throughout the night and the definitely lasts for over 12 hours. Unexpectedly quiet, too, even on high speed, compared with old-school humidifiers. I haven't cleaned it yet, but so far, I'm pretty impressed."
1,Broke for me quickly,"I have had two of these now. The first one broke, and I thought it was because I messed it up when I cleaned it. It actually worked well when it did work, and was relatively inexpensive, so I bought another one. This one broke within two weeks."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK","As with other products by KAZ, Inc.--no, it's not really made by Vicks--it is junk. Works about a month, then dies."
4,How to fix issues with the constant reset.,"I've had this humidifier for two weeks (mostly run on low) and loved it, yesterday it switched to an orange light (Reset) and would not come out of that mode.I scrubbed every bit of calcium off of the element (you have got to love California water) and that did not help. I started looking at the rest of the device and noticed the tank cap has a spring loaded valve, on this valve is a small knob at the end presumably to not allow the rubber bushing to fall off.I actually believe that is where the rubber bushing is supposed to rest, I grabbed the edge of the bushing and pulled it down until it snapped into place on the end of the valve stem and miraculously my humidifier is working like a charm now.I hope this helps other owners of this humidifier because it works well, is quiet and is quite simple to operate. The only negative is the reliability of the spring loaded valve in the tank cap."
4,Klasse früher Grönemeyer,"Die CD hat fast alle frühen Hits die ich wollte (mit der Ausnahme von ""Musik nur wenn sie laut ist""). Leider ist Männer mit 2:02 etwas kurz geraten, aber ist trotzdem toll. Dit Tonqualität ist recht gut, zwar nicht so wie ein Studioalbum aber es ist eben ein Livekonzert. Dafür hat man die Stimmung, besonders bei solchen Songs wie ""Bochum"" und ""Was soll das"", wo das Publikum begeistert mitsingt, aber auch beim gefühlvollem ""Halt mich"" und ""Land unter"" bin ich immer wieder erfreut wie die Leute mitgehen und mitsingen; es gibt einem wirklich das Gefühl mit dabei zu sein.Das eizige was ich zu bemängeln hätte ist, das es kein Doppelalbum ist. Livealben, sollten als Regel immer ein Doppelalbum sein, denn ein Konzert ist ja normalerweise auch etwas länger."
3,an okay compilation,"It's good to have a live album from Herbert G. with his 90's songs included. I particularly liked ""Land unter"" from his album ""Morgenrot"". And the Stimmung is very supporting but doesn't get too overwhelming (well, it's a German concert...). For some reason this man never give concerts in Scandinavia although he has a good cult following among German speakers over here. Herbert, if you read this, please arrange for a Flugzeug to Helsinki and come sing for your Finnish fans! Then we'll give you 5 stars!"
4,Perfect for christmas,"My boys (3 AND 1 1/2) own every little people item there is.I love this because now they can actually play with the manger set ..and learn about Jesus, Mary and Joseph. We bought it last Christmas and can't wait to bring it back out again. They really loved it and the animals."
5,"Great Toy, But Shame on You Amazon!","Yes, this is a great toy. I didn't know about the deluxe set with music and the lighted star, so we're fine without it. My biggest gripe, since the two sets I purchased were supposed to be gifts, is that it comes in a generic, ""plain wrap"" white box with black lettering on the front--definitely not gift material. I'll go to the Fisher-Price website for my gifts and give these to our church. Amazon, if you're going to pull something like this, at least show us a picture of the box so we know what we're getting. I discovered I wasn't the only one disappointed--but I had to read through more than a dozen reviews to find out! I'll think again before I place another order."
3,BEWARE!,I recently ordered 4 of these sets as gifts this year. I got my daughter one last year from the FP catalogue and she loved it. However Amazon is selling different ones than in the catalogue. It comes in a generic white box. Not very attractive when you are giving it as a gift. Another difference is that there is no music and the star does not light up. The real ones in the cataloue are only 8.00 more so I am returning all four of these sets and buying them directly from FP.I feel like I have been tricked by amazon since they do not post a product description. Shame on you Amazon!
3,OK but alittle disappointed,"I expected it to play Christmas carols like one I saw a few years ago. This is just like the musical one but with no music. I would have been glad to pay more and get the music but apparantly Fisher Price has discontinued that option, and yet they sell very quickly on ebay for up to $80."
4,Little People Christmas,I think the little people x-mas is addorable. I was a little disappointed that it didn't play music and have the star that lights up. I think they should have a better description of the toys on this site. But overall I am keeping the item because it is cute and my daughter will love to play with it.
4,Little People Christmas,"My almost 3 year old daughter really likes all her Little People play sets. She had the Farm and the Castle sets that she got for her 1st and 2nd Christmas'. This will be a really nice childproof nativity set I can have out for her to play with when the holidays come.I do like that this one is more ""accurate"" than say the Veggie Tale Xmas Nativity set. However, my daughter actually likes the Veggie Tale one a bit better, due to her fond affection for ""Larry Boy"" - LOL!We actually bought both and during the holidays will probably be keeping one under the tree in the Living Room and one out on display in the Family Room as well. But she can play with them both and I needn't worry that she is going to break or damage a crystal or ceramic nativity scene. And this set will help her learn about the birth of baby Jesus."
3,Helps with Telling the Story of Christmas,"I agree with the other reviews that while this is a nice toy that does help to tell the true story and theme of Christmas...it is not worth the month. I got mine instore and onsale and was glad I did not pay full price. The manger does not do anything, would have been nice to have doors or something so essentially you are paying for the additional Little People characters. I'm glad my daughter has it, but I am also glad I did not pay full price."
5,Great Learning Toy,"This is a great toy to teach your children the true meaning of Christmas, we can read the story to them but with the little characters the kids can get a visiual picture of what happened that glorious day!"
1,Overpriced!,$68.25?? Toys R Us sells it for $29.99. And where did they get a list price of $79.99 from? Fisher Price's own website lists it at $33.00. Total rip off here at Amazon.
3,A little disappointed,I thought I was getting the one that played music. And the box was very generic...this was for a gift and now I'm not so sure. Much smaller than I expected too...thought the newer little people were chunkier.
3,Another one confused by the mixup,"Count me among the others who expected to get something more, like you get with other little people sets, a fence to attach, a button to push. There isn't much to do with this one, and the barn is too small to interact/fit everyone in. Seems kind of chintzy. My toddler enjoys putting the donkey on the roof though instead of the angel. ;)Previous reviewer is correct though that it will work to tell the story and keep baby out of the real creche set. I don't mind the white box, simpler packaging is easier and cheaper for everyone.At least I ordered from TRU and didn't pay outrageous markup. One advantage of this set is it comes with lots of people. 3 wise men, animals, and the holy family."
3,Oumou Track is Amazing,Voix du Mali with Oumou Sangare is by far the best track on the album... near perfection
5,They're one of the greatest!,"Exile is awesome. Even though I'm only16, I still love them. I recently saw them in concert and J.P. told me and my cousin that it was rare (and cool) to see people our age who knew all their songs. They were really nice and put on a great show. Plus, this CD is great. :) Just like all their others>> :)"
3,Helpful only if you are into NLP,This book is context specific to NLP learner and users. The learning format is very procedual and needs a whole lot of discipline to practice. Not a typical Emotional Intelligence application. You might find it helpful if you are intersted in the Nurological/Linguistic aspect of the mind.
4,Very Pleased,I only buy Hawk brakes pads because they don't overheat and have minimal fade after several hard braking.
3,somewhat disappointed,"I, too, have had problems with my Olympus camera and hoped it was not standard for the brand. I have always owned Canon SureShots, but wanted to try something different when the last SureShot wore out. But like the customer from Cincinnati, the viewfinder is off center, the focus is, of course, affected by this problem, the flash does not function properly and washes out the subjects. I was told when I sent the camera and some sample prints in to Olympus for repair that my prints were shaky, and they sent it back. I wanted to like the camera; it has superb features. It is extremely light and it's easy to use. But up to this point, I have not been convinced to fall in love with it."
1,Two years,"If you want a camera to use for 2 years, then this is the one for you. The motor on my camera died after 2 years. It will cost as much to replace it as to buy a new one.I expect better quality than that from Olympus. I am very disappointed."
1,Camera Broke on First Use,The lens cover broke on the first use!!! I will never buy an Olympus Product again!
3,a bit light weight,"nice shorts, I think I will have to keep them for almost only races, they seem to be a bit light weight and the material is a little thin, although I have only worn them once, so maybe after a few more break in sessions I will be able to tell if they are going to be strong enough to train and race in."
3,"It's not like a Joe Cocker CD could ever be bad, but...","I thought his voice sounds a little tired and weak in this disc. I still enjoy it, but I don't think he spent a lot of time on perfecting his craft. Still a good addition to a CD collection."
4,"Good steering wheel cover...the smell is tough, though","The steering wheel cover is comfortable and durable. It arrived quickly and and in good condition. My only knock is that there is a petroleum smell. It isn't strong enough to stink up the car, but it definitely lingers on your hands."
2,Cheap- but it does cover my steering wheel.,"Cheap- but it does cover my steering wheel. Its already time for a replacement, and I have only had it about 6 months."
3,Much more advanced than typical Wee Sing compilations,"I love the Wee Sing series. They are generally easy to sing along with and are great for teaching children new songs. However, this particular compilation contains lots of songs with both a melody and harmony. Sometimes it's even hard to hear the melody to sing along with. Many of the songs have adults singing with the children, rather than just a children's chorus. There are also lots of songs that are sung in rounds. The age range for this was listed as 4-8. I think it's probably closer to 8-12, unless your 4-8 year old children are musically advanced. I'm still glad I bought it, but it's not nearly as useful as I'd hoped."
1,Don't Buy It,"I have the same problem as everyone else - the broken cog, for which HP offers no easy, or cheap, or reliable solution. After 8 months, I now have to get a different printer. What am I to do with the ink cartridges I just installed and paid big bucks for? Use your hard-earned money to buy a dependable product."
2,It's great until 90 days later!,"Okay, so when I bought the printer I was thinking HP is good, this is middle of the line, it must be pretty good. And the printer did its job for the first year, despite the loud noises it makes. Then, one day, all of a sudden, the cradle went completely to the right and got stuck. It would not come back! I called up the HP Hotline and they told me ""to pull as hard as possible"" to get the thing back to the middle. I tried pulling and basically nothing happened except that I pulled off the white strip. They then informed me that the cradle sticking tends to ""happen a lot"" and that I should just go out and buy a new printer since my 90 day warranty was up. I think you can decide for yourself, but if you plan on using a printer more than 90 days, I would reccomend a different model."
2,not as good as it claims,"It is 12ppm for a blank page, but less than 3ppm for a page with text. It takes 20 to 50 seconds to print a pdf page or a tif page.I used to have a HP laserjet 6L, which ran great for me. I took the advice of a BestBuy sales person that an inkjet print in the same quality as a laserjet. But they definitely do not match, even if they have the same dpi. You can see those tiny pixels in an inkjet printout.The toner cost is also higher for an inkjet. 200 pages/$12 vs. 2500 pages/$60.This printer shakes and creates a louder noise when it prints."
2,DJ 3820 IS defected and HP support can help you out!,"There are far to many reviews of this printer to note if anyone has already said this but like many of you, this printer worked well until 8 months into using it. About a month ago, I contacted HP support to see if I could fix it and the technician gave me great news about this printer. Turns out that it is defective and as a result, I would be given a replacement free of charge. By the looks of things, it seems that many of you have the same problem and I think its only fair that one gets what one paid for. If you can, get a hold of HP. From my experiences they have the BEST customer service."
1,JUNK,"I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this printer. It worked for the first 6 months, and since then it has been 1 issue after another!!! Adding insult to injury, HP has been of NO assistance either. My final issue was the ""cogs"". If this is such a common problem why doesn't HP address it? On well, this product married with the terrible customer service has left me frustrated, and less that 1 year later, in search of a new printer."
2,Typical Failure,"I will keep this short. I experienced the same failure, the ink cartridge sticks on the right side of travel and strips the small plastic gears. I have no problem with the plastic gears as all printers and electronics have them. What really pissed me off was the response from HP; they are aware of this problem and should issue a call back as so many of these have failed in the same manner. I have had considerable luck with other HP products so I will probably continue to use their products."
4,Great Introductory Book,"As an Art History major, and a former Architectural student, I was skeptical when I found this book required for my study abroad course on French Art and Architecture. Generally, I've found that books attempting to cover basic knowledge on such a broad topic are somewhat lacking. However, after the first chapter or two, I was pleasantly surprised with how much information was packed into this entry level architecture manual and how few instances occurred in which I wanted to edit or add to the content. I would certainly suggest this book for entry level courses or course which only require general knowledge of Architecture."
1,Lousy stinking OS!,"I have found Media Center Edition to be quite unstable relative to XP home or Pro. Why, I don't know but two computers I have purchased with it are extrememly unstable and have to be reinstalled every 6 months. Avoid this OS like the plague! Literally!!!"
5,Great Product!,"Honestly I'm always skeptical of products like this, but these were a great help. I have extremely flat feet, plantar fasciitis, and bad knees from a car accident and walk constantly at my job in steel toed boots (engineer at manufacturing facility). After the initial 1-2 weeks of getting used to them, my feet felt much better (corrected the extreme over-pronation), knees didn't hurt, and my lower back felt better. Definitely recommend this product!"
2,Cute gift for a Dora fan,Everything about the bag is great except for the fact that we got ours with no way to close it. I read the reviews and found out that it is supposed to have a magnetic catcher.
3,dora fan,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because she has an older brother starting Kindergarten and will think she's a big girl too if she has her own backpack. Just the fact that it's Dora's backpack makes it great. She loves it. I don't think it's really educational but I didn't buy it for that reason. It's just fun for her to have and it was very reasonably priced.
4,Very cute but one problem....get your sewing needle!,"I bought this backpack for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. It is very soft and roomy, and is really cute. She often pulls out the map and pretends to be Dora (it's attached to the pack for safe keeping).At first sight the magnet closure was pretty secure, and once closed stayed closed until my daughter wanted it open. But the SECOND DAY the magnet on the pack came loose and was lost in the lining of the pack. The one on the flap is still secure.I located the magnet and sewed it back in place (it looks a little rough but it won't get lost again!) I can't say that I know for sure that my daughter didn't cause this, but since she only had it for 2 days and is pretty easy on her toys, I suspect it is a defect or poor workmanship.However, it is totally fixable and worth it since this is the only backpack out there that is just like Dora's and not hard plastic. It really is cute and she loves it."
5,a wonderfully comforting and understanding analysis of loss,"a friend lent me this book after i lost a baby @15 weeks in 1994. i was struck by how two men could write a book with such great insight into a loss felt most intensely by women. the authors interviewed women who had experienced loss - either through miscarriage, infant death or stillbirth - and recorded their feelings in a most non-judgmental and sympathetic way.i found the section on doctors particularly illuminating, since the reaction of my own doctor had been less than warm. peppers and knapp theorize that doctors who choose obstetrics as a specialty, especially young ones, are ill-equipped to deal with loss.i have recommended this book to many women and will continue to do so. i applaud the authors for a wonderful source of comfort during a most devastating time"
5,"Don't buy the knock-offs, buy this.","I bought a knock off originally, within 2 months the wires became exposed and it stopped working altogether. I replaced it with Toshiba's adapter. The difference in quality is like night and day. Toshiba's cord is heavier, longer, and all around better made."
3,Erotica with a plot! ;-),"Overall, the book was very well done. Well contructed, fairly well plotted, and good characters.I did, however, have some problems with some of the presentations. Portraying the main characters as having an open relationship could be construed as presenting that as common withing lesbian and gay relationships, and didn't strike me as necessary, even for a book of, essentially, erotica.In addition, the political plot was presented as too easy for the villains to do - In a big city with lots of media coverage. Although I understand the temptation to show 'The Establishment' turning a completely blind eye to the problems of gays & lesbians, in this day and age, there are more than enough people who don't do so to make such a plot unlikely, at best.Still, all in all, it was well written, and an enjoyable read."
4,Beautiful high gloss photo's,"4 Stars for the incrediable photos! Outdated material and it's text appears to be translated from German, but the photos are awesome. The test does get into each Macaw type and their respective geographic information that is interesting, but most any other data should be read elsewhere in a more updated, newer U.S. text."
2,Why?,"A sci-fi novel about an engineer who creates artifical life, and deviates from the specs to create something that has abilities and emotions they aren't supposed to possess. Rather slow pacing, and no real action. At the end, I'm not real sure what the point of the whole story was supposed to be."
5,"Outstanding output, speed, and value","This printer set up easily and quickly, even to a very old PC running Windows 98. It prints quickly compared to other modern inkjet printers I've seen. Photographs print nicely on plain paper; I imagine the results on photo paper would be beautiful. Text is stunningly laser-crisp."
1,"Great printer, but the support is lousy","I purchased an HP5550 about a month ago. Prior to that, I had always used Canon printers, but the reviews said that the 5550 was a solid, inexpensive printer. It worked great for a month, and then the print heads locked up. I called the support line (a toll call -- no 800 line for support, even under warranty!) and was told that it would take 11 days for a replacement printer to arrive! After complaining that my business couldn't function for 11 days without a printer, I was told that I could get the printer in 2 days for an additional $20. And, of course, I have to pay to return the broken printer as well.So, this solid, inexpensive printer is no longer either solid or inexpensive. My recommendation: don't buy this printer unless you can live without it when you need service under warranty."

1,Will make you pine for your old dot-matrix printer,"This is simply the most awful, cheaply-made and unreliable product I have bought in quite a while. It misfeeds, mangles pages, and jams constantly . . . and this is my second one! The first one was replaced by HP (whose tech support people ARE knowledgeable and friendly) after several calls, but with a refurbished model. (""But it's only a month old!"" ""Sorry, we're exchanging YOUR defective model with another one that someone ELSE had a problem with!"") This model replaced a PhotoSmart P-1000 that had been pretty solid and reliable, but was water damaged and had to be replaced. This thing is a HUGE let-down."
5,Best printer ever made,This is the best printer ever made. Bought mine in 2002 for $50 used it as my main printer for 4 years until I got an all in one but still use this one to make photos. It makes better photo than Walmart photo center and with the right paper I have made photo that look like Olan Mills made them. Serious people can't tell the difference. It is also the best printer on ink usage ever made.
5,Immensely Listenable,"Bought this when it first came out (on an album). It remains my favorite for all these years. The pop song, ""I'm No Angel,"" prompted its purchase but it remains a classic to me because of its non-hits. Each song is my ""favorite"" until the next one plays. That being said, the song ""Things That Might Have Been""--which contains my all-time favorite song phrase, ""I could spend my life on a wonder...""--and ""It's Not My Cross to Bear"" are hypnotizing. They are so melodic and aurally rich. Jazzy, with some R&B and pop mixed in, this CD is really original. It borrows from many genres and comes up with its own very satisfying blend. I would guess, however, that most Allman Bros. fans won't appreciate it because 1) it's not raw; 2)over-long solos don't exist; and, 3) it's not southern rock. What one reviewer called ""overproduced,"" I interpret as sophisticated and nuanced. Yet this is not high-falutin' music. This CD never gets stale."
2,Sound is a bit too slick,"It was great to have Gregg Allman back on the radio in 1987 with the nice title track. The success of this album lead to another solo album the following year, but neither of these albums are of the caliber of his material with the Allman Brothers Band in the 1990s nor his recent solo album (Searchin for Simplicity).This album has a 1980s slickness to it that takes the ""soul"" out of the music. Gregg's voice is in fine form, but there is nothing too memorable from the music. I would go with Evening With the Allman Brothers Band (1992) or Searchin for Simplicity (1997) to really hear Gregg making rich, soulful blues-rock music."
2,Sappy and Simple-minded,"I wanted to be moved by this story about a girl supporting her best friend through a difficult time, but the main character Halley was whiny and self-involved, surpassed in the annoying category only by her clueless harpy of a psychologist mom. Everything from the bad boy love interest to the climatic prom night was cliched. The author would have done much better to focus on Halley's strong and interesting pregnant best friend Scarlett."
5,One of the greatest books I've ever read,"Everyone should read this book, not because its informative or whatever, just because you learn to look at yourself closer. I really think this book is perfect. Though you kind of wish some of the stuff that happens was concluded at the end. Like I kind of wished she get back together with Macon because he really loved her. Well just read the book and decide for yourself!"
5,Best how to deal w/ life book,"Someone like you was one of the best books that i have read, i bought it one day and finished it the next i just couldnt put it down..If you have ever wacthed the movie ""how to deal"" its pretty much copying that just leave out the divroced parents. Anyways this book is about these Two best friends Halley and Scarlett, scarlet unforutnly looses her love of her life to a motorcycle accident, and then ends up being pregnant w/ his baby.During all of this Halley seems to find her true love Macon who was micheals(guy who died) bestfriends..Im not gonan give you details b.c I wouldnt want to give away the book..but Im 14 and usually im not into reading books but this one was awesome and while ur out reading this one go and get the whole gossipgirl collection and sloopy first and second helpings!!! enjoy!"
5,Good relaxing rock album,"My recommend song is Track 01.Peter Sundel sings so wonderfully!!I am Sundel's fan since I met Grand Illusion,but his voice is also good for romantic pop songlike track 01."
5,The encyclopedia of pet travel information,"I've looked at all of the pet travel guides but found most to be too limiting and without enough information. AAA and Mobil guides merely excerpt information from their main series of travel guides and don't discuss the thousands of other great places to stay with a pet. The others limit me to name, address, and telephone number. I've owned On the Road Again with Man's Best Friend for six months, have taken over a dozen trips using it, and would not plan one without it. The web site information is great and allows me to see most of the hotels and inns before I ever make a reservation or put down a deposit. I also like the authors' descriptions of the better accommodations. Thanks for an indispensible resource!"
1,Book not very accurate,"Purchased book because want to go to Myrtle Beach S.C. to play golf and take the dog with me. I called four places, none of the information the books gave tied in with the information the hotels gave me. The one place that would take my dog wanted more for the dog than for my wife and I. I only bought the book because it had lots of listings. I wonder how innacurate the book is in other towns."
5,It's a great debut album....for 9-year olds to listen to!,"When i first bought the album I was about seven years old. I was totally in love with ""The New Kids."" Their first album made so much sense to me, with songs like ""Popsicle"" and ""Stop It Girl"". The lyrics and music was WAY eighties and you could tell a group of kids were meant to sing them, so it related. I really liked the album....12 years ago! But now it's too ""young"" for me. I listen to all their music and have to laugh because I was 100% obsessed with them....the way teeny-boppers are today with the Backstreet Boys. No doubt, New Kids were better, but the BSB have a better sound, an ""updated"" sound. But NKOTB will always be #1 in my book!"
1,THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY!,This totally sucked! nowhere in the listing did it say that this pos was a documentary with 4 nobodys reviewing thin lizzy albums! this is a rip pff especially for the price!!!!!
4,Wood handle stainless spatula,"Very nice for the price. A little smaller then I expected, but it woks for many uses.Nice heavy stainlee steel.I do not remember seeng the dimensions in the description of the item."
4,Nice knife for a variety of needs.,"I keep this knife around the house and the yard and have used it for everything from cutting rope to stripping wire. It has a relatively big blade, feels extremely hefty and opens smoothly. I really like this product and will purchase Kershaw again in the future."
3,splitter,i tried it only one side worked so i ordered a very good one same thing i thought two can't be bad i was trying to hook up my playstation so i called sony they said the modem needed more bandwith i have comcat so i called and they said the modem could not be split that explained everything so all in all they sent me a wireless router the spliiter is most likely good it is the modem so call your ISP and see if your modem can be split hope this helps it would have helped me. if one side only works call your ISP
4,Exploding Pills!,"This product has always been good, but this is the first time I purchased it in 1000mg tablets (I usually get the 500mg ones). The only problem I've had with these is that once I remove a pill from the original container to put it into my pill carrying case for the day, they tend to burst and release the powder all over the place, if they're there for an hour or two. It hasn't happened with every pill, but I would say about 30% of the time. I realize that they should be in the container with the desicant, but I've never had this problem before with the other lower dosage pills."
1,Pills are to large and exploded in my pill case!,"I could deal with the large size of the pill, but when I put them in my weekly pill case, the pills expanded and disintegrated into a powdery heap! I read the label and it didn't say anything about storing in original container. Very upset with this product. Not sure if this supplement even helps."
1,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this product. I was only able to use 80% of the bottle as they crack and burst as they get exposed to air slowly. I usually put some pills in a smaller container for my business trips but i always end up with powder and squashed coating after 24 hours.Tried once to swallow a cracked tablet but due to the size of it, it kinda hurt my throat due to the rough edges. Better go with the 500mg capsules, which are easier to swallow and less likely to burst."
3,First time good next wors,"I bought this two times, this was the first time and it was good, but the tablets were big and was very hard to consume. the next time I had to throw away some since the tablets became puffed and had to throw a lot of them away."
5,Worth the money,My family goes swimming quiet a bit. I got the Sports pack to take pictures of the kids underwater in the pool. This is a big hit. It works extremely well. I also highly recommend the Sony DSC-T9 camera. It's great for trips. It's so small you can put it in your pocket and the pics look great.
4,The Nativity Story soundtrack,The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. Mychael Danna wove old advent carols with music played on ancient instruments. The music portraying the ascent into Jerusalem is so moving. The movie is a must see next christmas season. The film takes the nativity story and brings it the human perspective that enhanced my spiritual experience.
5,"Excellent, practical and to the point.","If you are looking for a practical book on deer, turkey, upland birds and other wildlife food plot management, this is the best of all the books I have read. The book is based on the use of affordable equipment, Biologic seed products and sound agricultural practice. I have increased deer activity and estimated that the turkey population has tripled in 1.5 years.This is an excellent book at a low price."
5,great game,"This game has a small learning curve and the premise is solid, you are going from world (sphere) to world attempting to find your way someplace safe. I have not played emperors testament yet, but the original perimeter is a mainstay for days I want a game to waste a few hours on. Give it a try and see if you like it."
4,Funny Filosophies,"Anyone capable of appreciating metaphysical comic strips will drop their jaw at this one. Blegvad is one of the most versatile cartoonists around, so nearly every page bears a distinct look. Punchlines are in less favor than puns and visual gags here, so Garfield readers will be puzzled, lost, and eventually left behind on an isolated island with modest resources. Funny stuff for those of us who get off on absurdity and intellectual punning."
4,Montana Women,"Montana Women is a beautifully written novel. Ms. Volk's portrayal of the female psyche is stunning, making her characters remarkably real. I especially love Etta. Even Buck, the story's ""bad guy,"" is so vulnerable in Ms. Volk's hands that one can't help but forgive his humanness."
4,"VERY nice monitor, good price, Go for it","This is a wonderful monitor... It competes with the super high end LCD's that cost several thousand dollars. The size is wonderful and the text quality is better than most CRT's. Don't be afraid to purchase this monitor, you'll be happy when you get it!Pros:Dual monitor input (a/b switch between video feeds)Automatic configuration/tuning of imageCool swivel baseSuper high res"
4,Better than the more expensive Norelcos,"This razor is a good value. I tried Norelcos' more expensive model with more cutting blades, but didn't like it and returned it (to Norelco, not Amazon). One of my peeves on some models is tripping the on/off button because of it's placement. This model is better that way because you can hold it many different ways. My favorite is still the top of line black Spectra, which charges super fast and has an incredible battery life (132 minutes on my display). This razor uses the same cutters as my Spectra, which was one of the reasons I got it."
3,A very mixed bag,"I bought this to replace an aging (10 years old) Norelco that had trouble holding a charge. It is true that this model is easy to clean; cuts well and is a little unusual feeling in the hand. But as far as I'm concerned the compliments end there.Maybe mine is defective but this shaver has the shortest charge capacity of any shavers I've known. After one or two shaves it needs to be recharged which takes a couple of hours. So, for 15 minutes of shaving you need a 2 hour recharge? This is no deal. In fact, this is no good.It seems many have not had this problem or so I've not seen it in their reviews. But if this is the new ""face"" of Norelco; I think I'll take my face somewhere else."
3,The Norelco 7240XL shaver gets a grade of B,"The shaver gives a fast close shave, but it is not as good as the Norelco I bought 10 years ago. It is made of cheap plastic material, takes 8 hours to charge (as opposed to less than an hour for my previous shaver), came without a carrying case, and has no settings for making the shave closer or less close (unlike the earlier model). I'll probably give it to my son one of these days and get a better Norelco model...one that I first inspect in a store, since the photo online misled me."
4,Chasing The Gender Dream,"This book has changed my life. It has given me hope, and the know how to pursue my dream. It is written by a real person, not a doctor, who has had the same feeling so many of us have, but is not afraid to come out and say it. I realized that it's O.K. to love your boys, and still want a daughter. Now, thanks to Jennifer Merrill Thompson, I may heve the opportunity to experience what I have longed for for so long, but never thought I could have."
5,Highly recommended! (...),"Finally, a book about gender selection with up-to-date information about reproductive technology. All the research on gender selection techniques under one cover! This book was extremely informative from beginning to end. Highly readable, this book deals with real life experiences of women who have used different methods to try to balance their families. Whether you are looking to use at home methods or high-tech ones, this book is a must!"
1,"Not so good, and poor customer service","I found the image quality not as good as NEC monitors, even Viewsonic. I called Sumsung to inquire about what I suspected was overheating on the monitor, and I was on hold for over 1 hour. Thank god for speakerphone! And they refused to take back the monitor. So now i'm stuck with a defective unit."
4,Variety,"This case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone, but this is not for 2 people. The cereal went stale before we could eat it, but this would be great for a large family."
1,Great Idea .. but who needs it??,These filters are impossible to find locally. Amazon is the only place that has them. Six dollars to filter the water for your coffee is crazy .... a tap filter on your kitchen sink is a much better idea ....
1,Another rip-off marketing idea....,YOU DON'T NEED THESE!!! With the cost of these filters alone you could buy a BRAND NEW coffee maker almost every year. If you drink water from your tap or have a water filter (like a Brita or Pur) then you are just throwing money away. Would you like a samll order of fries to go with your large order of fries sir/maddam.
4,Coffee filter Disc,"They work Great, parturally when you live in a town that the tap water is not consistent."
1,You can't be serious!!,"After checking every store I could think of and accepting that I'd have to go online, I laughed out-loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don't even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. ""Train Man."" The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it's not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing."
3,Not his best,"SRV was one of the most exciting blues entratainers of all time. Unfortuanately, this album was recorded during one of the most troubled period of his life: just before he had to go to rehab for his drug\alcohol abuse. You can hear him struggling to get it together on these tracks. Any other live album out there is better than this one, this is only for completists."
5,ANOTHER EXCELLENT ALBUM,"I own every one of Stevie's albums. I can't place anyone as my favorite. They all have that mystique that Stevie possessed, therefore making it a great album. Live Alive speaks to the Angel and the Demon in all of us. That is how I feel he connects with us. Yes he was in a terrible battle with drugs and alcohol at that time, which many of us have been in ourselves. I don't think that depleats the greatness of this album. It just shows more truthfullness in his music, making it real for him and the listner. Buy this album. It is a must for Stevie Ray ""addicts""."
2,Not his best,"Some good stuff, but not his best. FYI, not to rain on everybody's parade, but this was recorded during the period when the whole band was pretty messed up on drugs and alcohol, and much of it was later overdubbed in the studio because the original tracks were below par. His best live stuff is probably Carnegie Hall..."
2,Disappointed!!,"I thought this was the cutest thing for my first baby's book. Even bought the matching photo album. But now that I am finished with it, and looking through it, the book doesn't open all the way because of the ribbon binding.If I could do it over again I would not buy the same thing!!"
4,IT'S HEAVY,"threads stripped easily on one side, had to replace. No big deal. Had sense May of 2007. I do believe it has done it's job."
2,Mistake,"I was originally looking for the ""Over The Edge"" movie soundtrack but this is what was sent to me. The original movie soundtrack had some good classic rock songs on it. This CD is from a time that I was not interested in. Too bad."
3,The air pump is anything but easy to use,The item is okay after get it inflated. The 'fun' is using the tiny pump provided with the product to actually inflate it. That in itself will give you lot of hand excercise.
1,USELESS PRODUCT/USELESS COMPANY,We recvd this product with a hole in it and have emailed company several times about returning it with no response. No phone # to contact company. Useless Product Useless Company. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME WITH PRODUCT OR COMPANY!!!!!
1,Body Wedge 21,"THIS ITEM IS USELESS, VERY UNSTABLE AND FLIMSY. UNTIL IT IS INFLATED, YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW AWKWARD AND UNSUITABLE IT IS. AND THE COMPANY WILL ONLY ACCEPT RETURNS IF IT HAS NEVER BEEN INFLATED. I THREW MY MONEY IN THE GARBAGE FOR THIS"
2,I won't go back again soon,"I had begun reading the Lovejoy series with the second or third book MANY years ago. However, maybe 8 or 10 years ago I stopped reading them because the series seemed to be stuck in a rut, focusing on aspects that I was much less interested in (what passes for Lovejoy's ""romantic"" life) instead of what I wanted (more with the scams and thefts).I saw this new one on the shelf and decided to give it another try. Disappointing. I finished it last night and am still not exactly sure who all was involved in this conspiracy and why. I COULD go back and read the last couple of chapters, but it just didn't interest me enough to bother. Oh well. Maybe I'll give it another try in another 10 years."
1,Mary misses the mark,"Purchased this book hoping to gain insight into the life of one of my favorite poets. Very little about George and a lot about Mary. Precious little writing of their love, passion, inspiration. Mary seemed to be enamored of Communism and not her husband. Everything, including George suffering six shrapnel wounds in WWII is written in an off-handed, seemingly uncaring way. Paragraphs often contain two or three unrelated events which made the book narrative difficult to follow, Mary's syntax is often scrambled and the book appears to be unedited, as if it were self-published. Definitely not recommended."
2,"Universal, Captain Oi!, what's the difference...","Great album, rotten remaster. How disappointing. Clearly Universal should also have listened to the master before pressing this disc, as it has the same skip in ""Quit This Town"" as the Captain Oi! version. So, if you're determined to have this on cd, buy the Captain Oi! version and save some dough since they're exactly the same. If you want a copy without the skip, my advice is try to find a clean copy of the vinyl, which is the only way to listen to music anyway..."
2,Liked their original formula better,"I had been using their original cleaner premixed in the little plastic jars and loved it for years so I ordered several of these little packets for my daughter and I. It is not the same. It cleans well, but the formula gets very thick and gel-like very fast with thick clumps so that you have to add hot water. I used a brand new container just once on diamond studs and then two weeks later went to use it again, and it was all thick and cloudy and gross looking."
2,come again,The black+white combination is fabulous but the pointed toe is way too pointy (didn't look that way on the site). My solution wear them with pants which is a shame because it hides the shoes.
1,Poor reception,"I purchased this radio because of the digital tuner feature. But the old radio with an analog tuner actually does much better at separating radio stations. The radio station that I am trying to listen to is 107.9 on the FM dial. The interfering station is 107.1. It is my expectation that these stations are far enough apart that a ""good radio"" would keep them separated. The Timex radio does a very poor job. The good news is that I now realize the radio I was replacing is actually a good radio even though it has an analog tuner - I have to fiddle with it now and then, but when it is set, no more interference."
4,A great combination of features at a great price,"While the features could be set up to be combined in other ways, I love this product because it has the three (four if you count the beeping) types of alarms, and can play CDs. I think the sound is really good, and the nature sounds play their part well to be good ambient noise. I have no problem with viewing the display and enjoy the dimmer and large display."
3,pretty...good as scrap-book,I wish it had more questions...alot of blank unlined space...good for pictures I guess.But it really is pretty...I love the lace up side.
3,Comprehensive but dry,"Cozzen has produced the comprehensive tome on the battle of Chattanooga. All the information you need to understand the flow of battle as well as the political intriguing that helped to shape the results is here. What is mostly lacking is a spark of life, or a sense of being there. With a few exceptions, Cozzen's battle descriptions have more of the feel of a wargame played out on a map than the chaotic, life and death struggle that it surely was. For those who have an interest in the battle, you should have this book, for reference, if for nothing else. Be aware that it is dry, and more of a book that you must work at to get to its virtues than a thrilling read. I would only recommend this book to those with a serious interest in the battle of Chattanooga, but for them, it is a must have.Theo Logos"
2,MM08 working with leather dvd,"I was looking forward seeing this dvd on working with leather, but I was greatly dissapointed when I did. I found very little that I liked about it, mostly because I had expected to learn how to make real leather bags and trunks. But the ones that she makes on this dvd is only made to look like the real thing - and that was not what I was looking for. I found this dvd not worth the money, sorry. This is my opinion anyway. The dvd on how to electify your doll house was great and if you are about to make your own doll house, I can recommend that one."
4,Not quite perfect,"The shaver itself is ergonomic, powerful, superbly designed and extremely effective. It would be difficult to improve on this excellent product.It is a pity, therefore, that Philips didn't extend the same engineering brilliance to the rest of the product. As a starter, the transformer that comes with the Bodygroom is rated only for 120 V, so it's not usable in most countries of the world. I would have thought that such a unit would have been made with travel in mind.Furthermore, the storage stand has no place for the three combs, another oversight.If Philips were to bring out a version of the Bodygroom that includes a universal transformer built into a storage stand that also provides a convenient location for the three combs, then it truly would have achieved design perfection!"
5,Shaving your balls is now a little easier.,"Shaving cream burns so be carefull, make sure to pull taught with firm grip. Oooh thats smooth."
4,Great for hard to reach areas,This product works best when your skin is dry. The best aspect of this product is your skin does not get irritated. I have sensitive skin as well and have had no problems.
2,Returned it,"This was kind of a bummer. I was really anticipating getting this, but was really let down.I knock down my chest hair usually every couple of months. But this could not manage to trim much.Performs poorly in comparison to the standard beard trimmer. Had to keep running over the same spots repeatedly to get any results.Returned this after the first use."
4,It works!,This is my second one of these. The first one died after 4 years of service and not very good maintenance by me. It works as described and it does a satisfactory job of trimming all types of body hair.
5,Bodygroom,Love this product! Cuts shaving time in half and the price was unbeatable. Could not ask for any better results or price.
2,Braun is Better,I have a Braun electric that I bought for my face about two years ago. It actually works better anywhere on the body. I was disappointed in the Phillips and would not buy it again.
2,Disappointing,Don't waste your money on this. You're better off buying a hair clipper for less and using this with it's attachments.
1,do not buy this thing,"This thing was the worst buy I have ever made. I bought it because I have come to trust Norelco and Philips for quality and living up to their claims, but the bodygroom is just awful. The trimming option, what I mainly bought it for, works terrible. It's flimsy, awkward, and just doesn't trim well. I tried to shave with it figuring it might make up for its lack of trimming quality that way. I was wrong. It kind of pulls the hairs, making it feel uncomfortable if not plainly painful. On top of that, the shave is nowhere near as close as what a regular razor would do- I would have to use it twice a day to look smooth, and it takes forever to actually get that close shave. I know it says that it takes time to adjust, and that you should give it 3 weeks, but it was so bad I wouldn't have given it another day. The only good thing is that Philips has a 60 day refund policy, which I am taking advantage of today. TERRIBLE PRODUCT"
3,A Little Disappointing,"It is a very nice product but I was a little disappointed. It took a while to shave perfectly but, in the other hand, the trimming is really good."
4,Great product.,"After several years, my first Body Groomer blew it's circuitry in Africa. Replace it as soon as I returned to the States."
5,"Works Great, Never Cuts the Skin, Good All Over the Body","I bought this trimmer for ""manscaping""... I trim down my pubic hair using the 1 mm comb and I've been very happy with the results. With the comb your hair is trimmed to a uniform length and it never cuts your skin. Safe to use in ""sensitive"" areas. In the hard-to-reach corners right up between your legs you can take off the comb and use the naked blade...again, I've never cut my skin with this. I haven't had the guts to try the naked blade on my shaft or scrotum, but I suspect it wouldn't be a problem.I also discovered that it's excellent for trimming the chest and back of the neck. The blade pops off and on so it's easy to clean between uses. Just be careful not to lose the combs!"
2,Not so good - - skip it,"We got this groomer and in the instructions it said you had to get used to using it. Tried for a couple of days and got tired of saying ""ouch"" when it pinched over and over. We returned it to the manufacturer."
3,"Not bad, but I've used better.","My girlfriend bought me this one last month as an ""upgrade"". I've been using the Remington BHT 2000 for about a year now and I like it much better. The Philips isn't a bad product but it doesn't feel as well made. IMO the Remington is easier to use and I don't have to worry about it breaking. The Philips has too many attachments for my liking and they feel cheap. I guess I've been spoiled with my Remington which uses an adjustable wheel.The Philips Bodygroom does work as advertised but I'll continue to use the Remington. If the BHT 2000 does break, I'll use the Philips until I can replace the Remington. I would strongly recommend getting away from using a standard razor. And as far as men's body grooming products go we only have a choice of two or three. If this is the only one you can find I would get it. If you can find the Remington BHT 2000 I would go with that one instead."
4,"Not bad, just be patient when using it","I just bought this at Target and gave it a try tonight. It does take some patience when using, you can't just run it all over your body and be done with it. If you are very hairy, it's better to use something more heavy duty to thin the area out first, then use this groomer to trim down further. As for the blue guards and blade head, they are not hard to remove..you just have to do it gently, and I admit it takes some practice. A good blow on the head of the groomer is necessary quite frequently since the hair collects fast. I've only used it on the chest so far, next time I'll venture down further. I'd recommend it, it's the best thing I've tried and does the job."
1,Misleading Advertising,"Bought two of these for gifts based on the wet/dry emphasis. Never realized you ""can't"" use if for facial hair!!!!!!!!!! How stupid and embarassing!!!!!!!!!!! Please take my purchases back!!!!!!!"
1,cheap product,I had to fix the shaving foil when I got the product.it doesn't do a good job of shaving either.I would NOT recommend this product to anyone
3,Good. Almost there. But needs a few tweaks.,"I really like the BodyGroom. But one of the problems I had with it, is that the ""on"" button got stuck one day and I couldn't shut it off. I had to let it buzz and buzz until the batteries died. After I recharged it, it was fine. Also, when I use the guards, it seems like I'm not really shaving, as if I'm not shaving at all. I usually have to use the BodyGroom without the guards to actually trim my hair."
3,Rusty!,"I really liked tis razor at first, but extended use has shown its flaws. First of all, while the battery life is really good, the blades end up becoming somewhat dull pretty quickly. Also, after 5 months of use, rust started to appear on the blade -- yes, rust! This razor is supposed to be ok in water and ok to rinse, but it doesn't seem to be holding up very well."
2,dont buy if you want baby smooth,"I heard good things, and figured I'd give it a try.it really depends on your hair removal goals.If you want a trimmer and youre okay with stubbly-feeling skin, buy this.If you are looking for hair removal to the point of having baby smooth skin... this will NOT do it. It just doesnt cut it (ha! pun!).... and my body hair is pretty fine compared to a lot of peoples. It still is all stubbly like sandpaper.. which isnt exactly fun to rub up on, im guessin. lol.Stick with the blade or wax.Was hopin for better. But kinda figured it wouldnt do what i wanted."
1,Complete waste of money,"This product is horrible. I can't imagine that they would sell it as a groomer. Even at the shortest setting, it barely cuts the hairs and when it does, it does it more by pulling than trimming. I used it once and then tossed it. DO NOT waste your money!"
5,Good Grooming is important,"Very pleased with this Body Shaver from Phillips. So fast and convient to get a clean fresh look any where on a mans body. Used to use razor and shave cream, very messy and time consuming. Now it is so quick, to get that clean, smooth, desirable look to any part of your body, which I feel is very important. No more hairs to get in the way of your enjoyment."
3,Sooo slooooow.,"If you're in the market for a body hair groomer, skip this item over and spend $15-20 more on the BG2030. The reviews for that item claim that it turns a half hour job with the BG2020 into a five minute job using the BG2030. I bought the BG2020 and was so displeased with how long it took to get the job done that I did more research and found the BG2030.If you're in no rush, though, this is a pretty decent product. I was very cautious at first because nobody likes getting nicked or cut down there but after my second use I decided to be a bit more cavalier and still didn't get nicked. Don't lose the AC adapter for it, though, because it's hard to find a replacement and when you do it's about $20 so you might as well buy another unit so that you have a back up groomer."
3,Bodygroomer - not Bodyshaver,"Before I purchased this item, I read the mostly favorable reviews and got pretty excited, but for around $35.00 I was cautiously optimistic. After charging the unit I tried it out for the first time, and found it took some time to get used to, for two reasons.1. Getting the angle right so it trims well is tricky2. Getting comfortable using a device that looks like this around your private areas is unsettling initially, but I've used it 3 times now and haven't had a nick or cut yet.This product does what its name implies, it ""grooms"" you, it doesn't shave you. What I mean by this is, you will get a much closer shave by using a manual (facial) razor and shaving cream/gel.It does feel sturdy, however the head can be a little large for getting certain areas. All in all a nice unit, but don't expect a straight-edge shave with it."
2,Waste of money,I'll give the item 2 stars based on feel and looks.. The item wouldnt hold a charge for longer than 10mins first use then wouldnt last 1min the next attempt. But I would have gotten a faulty tool...
1,Junk!! Don't even think about wasting your money on this!,"I purchased my first BG 2020 in May of 2006. I used it several times a week and within a few weeks it started making a terrible rattling noise. This noise was the cutter and foil rattling in the head. This also caused the cutter and foil assembly to fall out regularly. It was effectively worn out after a few weeks. I contacted Philips and had to send in the original BG for a replacement. After using the replacement, same thing happened. It's not durable at all- apparently they only planned on the user using it once a month. If used once a month, it MIGHT last a year. It's definitely NOT designed to be used every day or every other day, unless you want to replace it every few weeks.It needs to be completely redesigned as far as the cutter/foil goes so it will be more durable."
1,stubble maker,This is not an effective body trimmer or shaver. It is cheaply made. It doesn't cut cleanly and even at its closest setting leaves stubble you (and your partner) will feel. I threw mine away after using it for a few months.
4,good product,"Not many products with a specific male body grooming needs . I am happy with it . It kinda nicked my skin near my balls once . But , i try to keep my skin a lil taut and i haven't had problems since .I really like that it can be used wet . Though i think it does a better job dry .I have not used the adjustment combs . so ,dont know about that . Would be surprised if they actually work well ."
1,Ineficient,"This unit is worthless for any kind of cutting using the combs. Hair just builds up above the cutters and very quickly making any kind of cutting a joke. The hairs just don't clear away, they just pack into the area between the comb and the unit itself. It does OK with out the combs but no good with a comb attached."
2,"poor battery life, cheap construction","After 10 months of owning this item (about 5 uses), its battery is unable to hold a charge. Even when the battery was in new condition, the unit wouldn't last for more than 45 minutes of shaving. For an entire body touch-up, one might need a trimmer with that can actually last an entire trim or shave.Also, the unit is made of flimsy plastic, which cuts down on weight but also decreases durability. And though I've never exposed the trimmer to shower conditions, I doubt it would hold up, despite its being touted as ""wet/dry."" The no-guard foil option up to a #1 guard are close enough to nick skin and draw blood, so watch out!Bottom line: Look elsewhere when considering a male body hair trimmer."
2,Loose fittings and sticky switch.,"Finally it gave up! I pressed the soft switch to turn it on. But the switch sunk in deep and would not release itself. So that's the end of that -- the battery ran out, it cannot be used anymore because you cannot charge it with the switch in ON position and you cannot turn it off! What a dilemma.When it worked, it was great, except the comb attachments would drag on my skin and fall off the groomer clip constantly. It got a little annnoying after a while."
4,body shaver,"i used it for the first time. it does pretty well, its not great like a razor but it does the job, also you can use it with water, or in the shower."
2,Not the greatest,"For all the hype this is a mediocre product. If you're going to promote a product that shaves HIGHLY sensitive areas you should pay close attention to design. Putting trimmers on both sides can be a dangerous proposition on some parts. For chest, back etc, it's a great concept, otherwise not so much. With advances in electric shavers this seems a bit behind the ball in design.Use with CAUTION!"
1,"this does NOT work,","This simply does not work, it still snagged my hairs, and when i did shave with it, it doesn't get close at all! yeah it doesnt hurt when you put the blade to your skin, but it doesnt cut either."
2,Surprised by all the positive reviews,"I've owned this for a couple of years and haven't used it that much over that time. Ever since I got it, I've noticed that it is very flimsy. I was expecting that it would break at any moment. The blue plastic things that you put on also are not sturdy. They also don't seem to spike up the hair too much so that the blade actually cuts them. After a while I've noticed that it becomes very slow and doesn't really trim down the hair even after charging.What I do like is that it charges, so no batteries required and its very light. I think I will go with another trimmer next time. Also I have only noticed that its useful for legs and chest, not really any other area. Actually for legs is what its best if you just want to have trimmed hair and not completely shaved off."
5,"just what I wanted , on time.",Great product at a decent price. The product works well. I recommend it. Philips Norelco makes good shaving products: this one is no exception.
4,"Underarms - oh, yes!","I bought one for my husband, and ""borrowed"" it to do my underarms. No nicks, nice clean shave. I like the cordless feature. Saying goodbye to the shaving cream and razor. I'm buying one to leave in the gym locker, and plan to try it in the shower. Will update review after that trial."
5,Men's Bodygroom - Excellent,"I just purchased the Philips Norelco BG2020 from Amazon a few weeks ago, and it was everything I expected - Shaving sensitive areas without the fear of a cut, or snag, whatever. I kind of wish that it would shave faster - like a face shaver for example. Perhaps if it shaved any faster, it might be a bit more dangerous though...I must say that ""feeling fresh"" is what this product helps you feel :-)No complaints here."
5,Excelente !!!,"I am very pleased and satisfied with the product for me is excellent, no I do not like nad, meets all my expectations ..."
3,Ok but overpriced,Not a good stubble trimmer which is what I wanted originally. It is water proof so I use this in the shower for my body and pubic hair. Doesn't cut my tacobell sack. For a stubble beard groomer I would go with the Philips Norelco with the Vacume. It's only like 20 bucks more.
3,Okay,"It was an okay shaver, but I've only used it once, and gave it to a friend. I've got a good amount of body hair, and after the first go, while not painful, it did irritate the skin a bit, leaving red spots behind."
1,A waste of time and money,I have owned two of these clippers / groomers - and I have to say - that they are a sheer waste of money and time -esp. if you have a decent amount of body hair. They don't really cut hair - there is more pulling than cutting. And it takes for ever to shave my chest hair - i have go over the same spot over 10 times to get a clean cut. Shaving my chest with this useless device takes upto 1/2 hour or more and a lot of redness and pain. Definitely not worth it.
2,Not good enough,"Hello there,I have this groomer for an year, I use it once a week to removeGood:1/ It is cheap2/ It gets the job done, though it takes an effort and timeBad:1/ It wears off, in 1 year it is not good anymore, Changing of shaving head will cost more than buying a new groomer.2/ The shaving head is made of very thin foil and plastic, foil can be bent incorrectly easily and broken (torn) the plastic is damaged right on the first month so you need to firm the head somehow else, i did it with a paperI admit you cant expect more for a 35$ groomer, despite the problems I consider it a good purchase. I am looking for something better, more lasting and more expensive, but I seem to not find it."
4,It Does What It Does,"This product does exactly what it claims to. It takes care of body hair where you don't want it, and it does so without irritation, rashes or ingrown hairs. I generally use this only on the back of the neck (cleanups between haircuts) and chest, and it's much better than a regualr razor: faster, more effective, safer. Definitely recommended!It gets four out of five because it's a little noisy and the battery (while long lasting) can only be charged when fully drained. However - I have dropped this numerous times in the shower, some of which cause the entire foil and cutting surfaces to become detached from the body of the groomer. I simply re-inserted them back, and it still worked perfectly. Very surprised at the resiliance of this product, and happy, too."
1,A struggle to use......and a waste of money,"I bought this as an easier alternative to methods I had been using. It turned out to be a total waste. I threw it away. It had only one redeeming quality which is the fact it can be used in the shower. The cutting blade on both sides of the shaver is a struggle to get it to cut anything and when it does it clogs very quickly. The razor part is also difficult and ridiculous.You are much better off to use a standard hair trimmer (like for cutting the hair on your head) for the big jobs and a safty razor for the close jobs. This shaver is just a gimmic. Another tip, I recently figured out that shaving my skin on my back and arms with a safty razor is easier when done completly dry.......who knew!"
2,Not Happy,The Shaver gives a very clean shave but the trim blades on each side of the shaving head will cut you very easy so beware...
2,"Strong Start, Weak Finish","Mine worked great at first. I only used it once a week or so. Trouble is, the internal (recharging) battery gets weaker and weaker over time. As it does, the blades get slower and slower and the amount of time it will stay on gets shorter and shorter. At first, it's just a minor annoyance and the shaver just doesn't run as long but still cuts hair long enough to get the job done. But eventually, it starts ""pulling"" hair instead of cutting it, even when taking it straight off the charger. For that reason, I can't recommend it. If you decide to buy it, expect it to work great the first year and then start slowly going downhill. I definitely would not recommend you buy any additional blade heads because the shaver won't last long enough to wear the original one out."
5,Great item,"I wish I had ordered this long ago. It is much gentler than what I had previously used - the pop-up trimmer on my razor (ouch). And the three length attachments make it easy to shave a fade in my armpits! But seriously, the foil on this lets you shave sensitive areas as smooth as you like with no irritation."
1,Not too good,Pretty unhappy with this product.I am a cyclist so have been trimming leg hair formany many years. Usually I just use a hair type trimmer with the short attachment. We use to shave for competition but these days a trimmer is close enough. Unfortunately this unit does not seem to do anything at all.I was really surprised because there was so many good reviews. Perhaps these folks have longer hair?In any case I wish I had not wasted my $$ on this one. It really does nothing at all for me. I drag it over my lags but it does not seem to cut anything at all. I am using the smallest attachment for the shortest hair cut. But no joy here.
3,"OK, but not great","I purchased this product thinking it would replace a t-edger type product. It could not. It was too slow, and the smallest attachment left too much hair behind for my taste. I prefer to have some hair behind (what the 0 attachment leaves) but not remove so much that it looks shaved.For my taste, this product just could not do that. If you like your body hair to have more than 1/4-1/2 inch, then this would be great for you. If you like to have less, but not have it shaved, don't get this."
4,Norelco Bodygroom is well worth it,The bodygroom is definitely worth the money. It safely removes chest and shoulder hair with minimal irritation. It is a little more comfortable in the shower with the use of soap. I have not been bold enough to use it below the waist since it does have the tendency to catch hair on rare occassions...
1,Only for men with really thin hair!,This product is not for men with thick hair. I am not a hairy person by any means but what hair I do have is thick. It's great that it's water resistant but that dose'nt matter much if it dose'nt cut the hair. Everytime I take off the blue thingies the whole face comes off. Poor quality all around.
5,Unbeleivable,Just Perfect ... If you are sane then nothing goes wrong while using this ..As simple as that
2,Isn't the twig and berry groomer the reviews claim it to be,"All right, I'm not excessively hairy. I was just looking for an electric for shaft and buddies, mainly because when I've tried with a razor I just psych myself out. The bottom line is that I purchased it specifically for the ghoulies, and not only does it not do a thorough job, nothing is more disheartening than seeing dots of blood around your junk, even just a touch. So I'm back on the market again..."
3,decent budget hammer,Decent budget hammer. Feels solid in the hand though not weighted as well as some of the higher end reflex hammers. The rim surrounding the larger head is too prominent and can hit the patient when your using that end. Not well designed in that perspective.
4,Great voice and really nice material.,"Christine Collister is right up there with the finest vocalists e.g. June Tabor,Kate Rusby,Cara Dillon,Karan Casey,I bought this release for her version of ""Moon River""."
2,Cut and paste special,"This lame attempt to put out a realistic street defense book is simply a cut and paste effort, and those who have read other self-defense/reality fighting books will see it for what it is. Some of the information is valuable, thus the two star rating, but you can find the same information in other sources written by more capable fighters/authors. My copy went in the trash."
1,beware! shipping cost makes this an expensive purchase,"i've been looking for a way to get polaroid film for a good deal, and this item caught my eye - until i ordered it and was charged $7.30 for shipping. that takes the total up to $25.19 which is NOT a good deal. i'll bite the bullet and buy it at my local store for about $1/exposure. then i don't have to wait the extra 5-10 days to get it in the mail, either...so BE WARNED - DON'T FORGET TO FACTOR IN SHIPPING FEES (which won't be factored in for you until you're on the next-to-last step in the checkout process)..."
5,Mantra and Self-understanding,"Mantra is a tool to connect with subtle vibrations that transform our minds/hearts into purified existence. The mantra avialable on this recording can help you in that direction. Green Tara mantra is usefull for all kinds of healing, be it personal afflictions, addictions, vices etc.. The Vajrasattva Mantra is for purification and resolution of past karma.This is not music, this is prayer. Her voice on the recording is full of clarity and innocence, and this is passed along to the one listening to this chanting.I work in a spiritual bookstore and have listed to hundreds of ""mantra"" cd's. This is of the highest quality and sincerity of heart that you can possibly find."
4,Classic 80's,"If you love 80's mucis, and could use a few good clean love songs, this album is for you."
3,"A good overview, but use with caution","I did like this book; the format and variety of the spells were great. My only word of warning is that a few of the spells (eg. the Happy Homebreaker) should be used with the Wiccan Rede in mind (what you give out comes back times three) and I don't think this was spelt out clearly enough. One spell was marked that extreme results could cause death! I don't think it's entirely responsible to include this particular magick in an area aimed at beginners. Other from that, a very enjoyable read. :)"
4,Smart water requires smarts. Read first.,I spoke with a G.E. smart water representative and(#1) I learned that the sediment I was experiencing was due to the fact that the grey filter must be placed on the incoming water side or you will encounter charcoal filtrate.(#2) I would also recommend that you acquire a adjustable rubber strap wrench to loosen the filter housing. The filter is quite effecient in toxic material removal and is surprisingly heavy upon removal on replacement.
2,While interesting is seemingly irrelevant,"Richard Blow is a former coworker of Joh F. Kennedy Jr. who seems to be attempting to make a couple of bucks off of a respected celebrity who has passed on with this book. While Richard obviously knew John, after reading this book it is apparent that he barely knew him outside of work. Judging by the cover and name of this book one would suspect that it is about JFK Jr. In reality this book is about George magazine and Richard's experience working there, with tales of dinner with John placed randomly about. If you are looking for a book that will give you an idea of what type of person JFK Jr. was, I would recommend ""The Men We Became"" by Robert Littel. He was John's best friend and knows far more about John than nearly anyone else ever did."
4,AMERICAN SON A PORTRAIT OF JOHN F KENNEDY JR,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND. SHE REALLY ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK OF OUR AMERICAN SON. THIS BOOK ARRIVED IN A SHORT TIME AFTER ORDERING AND IN GOOD SHAPE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS
2,He never answers the biggest question....,"which is why would Kennedy have hired a writer who was so trite and melodramatic as Blow in the first place? Let me preface this comment by saying that I went to Yale with Richard and lived in the same residential college for three years with him. I did not know him well....probably as well as he knew Kennedy, but you don't see me trying to explain Blow to anyone. Blow pretends he was non-plussed by Kennedy's aura, but he protests too much. This is no insider's glimpse of Kennedy, but a vapid attempt to make money at the expense of the tragic end of a life he claims to have honored. The most ironic part of the book was when the staff debated the character of George Stephanopolis who wrote a book about Clinton..The word used to describe George S. fits Blow to a t---""scumbag"""
2,odd,"There is something odd and unpleasant about this book. The author was by his own account, not the best friend of JFK Jr. It isn't a great or even very good biography. The author also, can't seem to explain why he wrote it. This book, alas adds nothing to history and seems more like backstairs gossip than anything else. It's Kitty Kelly without the clever writing. Even if you collect Kennedy books this is not a must have."
4,Interesting Idea for a Book,"I thought the idea of a book about John Kennedy, Jr.'s tenure at George magazine was a good one. Instead of a slick and glossy tome about ""America's Prince"" or ""The Most Beautiful Man in America,"" his former associate, Richard Blow, has fashioned a interesting account of the beginnings and ultimate ending of a man's search for identity and purpose.That JFK, Jr. was able to put together a political magazine as he saw that world, does indeed make for fascinating reading. The inner workings, in-fighting and eventual ending of a publishing phenomenom is a nice change from the usual tabloid fare that we are used to seeing about members of the prolific Kennedy family."
2,ick,"Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money. They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated. They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day. I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes."
4,Simply Red,I like Simply Red. The DVD has some of his greatest music. Great for a party and having as background music along with the visual.
3,"interesting, but not great","This novel reads like a fairly well constructed scientific detective story.While the characters are somewhat clichéd -- there is the lone dissenterwho thinks out of the box, and eventually befriends the orthodox scientist --the overall idea is not too bad. Unfortunately, I find that the plot twistsand speculative science in these novels are not nearly as surprising and amazingas those nature has presented us with over the last 20 or 30 years.Brian Green and Nick Lane are just two authors who have written a fascinatinglyon some of those discoveries. Hogan may have taken himself a little too seriously as well.It appears that he still subscribes serioulsy to the ideas of Velikovskii."
5,Inherit The Stars,"I have always liked a good mystery book and when I read the back cover of ""Inherit The Stars"" I was hooked. It was the best book I have ever read. Like some of your other reviewers I too have read this book many times. James Hogan is a master at weaving a story from science fact and science theory. I have read all of James Hogan's books and have enjoyed them greatly, but ""Inherit The Stars"" is still for me his most enjoyable. This would make a great movie!!"
2,I Beg To Differ....,"The book reads like early Asimov, and that's not a compliment: wooden dialogue, cardboard characters, uncritical enthusiasm for the UN and a 'gimmick' ending that's (a) obvious fifty pages before the author reveals it and (b) to be kind, somewhat unlikely.There might be some excuse for this book if it'd been written in 1948; in 1978, not so much."
1,STAY WELL CLEAR,"The original soundtrack of the movie was released on vinyl in 1983 and deleted before CD was even invented in 1985. Therefore this is not a legitimate CD. Don't waste $80 or so on this because it's very, very poor quality. A bootleg. I know it's tempting because it's a great soundtrack, but trust me -- don't waste your money because it's an illegal bootleg. There was NEVER a SPECIAL LIMITED CD released commercially anywhere in the world. Never. You cannot, repeat CANNOT get the VACATION soundtrack on CD anywhere in the universe apart from this guy who is selling it. You've been warned."
1,for real?,i guarantee this product is an illegal pirate. does anyone really think they would do a special rerelease from a marginally successful soundtrack released 23 years?
4,Five of Six Ain't Bad,Terry Gilliam's disc was about an hour too long. His odd animation is fantastic as a segue between acts but when it goes on and on and on...But the rest of the set is fantastic. A must have for any Python fan.
5,less mess,i love the vacuum feature. it doesn't get every hair but it is better than a messy sink area. i had the previous model and it actually shaved closer. the new plastic guide is bigger on this one. no big deal...just means i need to trim everyday instead of skipping days.
3,Not as good as its predeccesor.,My old T965's battery gave up after 4 faithful years of service. The problems with the new T980 are: the new body is a hard slick plastic which is more difficult to grip (slips out of the hand); the small/fine trimmer is now an attachment. That means you've got this small trimmer head that you have to keep in the medicine cabinet or when you travel in a safe place where you won't lose it; the depth indicator is hard to read and the numbers aren't always centered in the tiny viewing window. Philips has now replaced the old standard coiled power cords with specialized adapters. This means when you're on vacation you've got to bring the AC adapter for your face trimmer and then bring a different AC adapter for your beard trimmer.Pros: It looks real pretty. It cuts well.
1,Piece of Crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don't actually lock!! I tried putting it on length ""3"", but when I started to trim, it went down to length ""2"". Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1. Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it's called), so it's very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower. I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t. In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy ""vacuum effect"" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY! I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option."
1,Bad...Very Bad!,"I bought the Philips Norelco T908 Turbo based on other customer reviews. I wish I hadn't. The thing is a piece of junk. The swivel adjuster for setting beard length moved when I was using it and suddenly I was cutting off more than I wanted. Also, the plastic catcher broke after about a month. Avoid this like the plague!"
3,Observations from a previous Norelco owner:,"This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming. The settings match up well with those from earlier units and, once set, there is no slippage from one setting to another. In my estimation, the ""turbo"" feature adds no functionality, only noise and increased battery drain. The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed. A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life. And as with the last trimmer I owned, the NiCad battery is not replaceable, but it should be. The battery is the size of a standard AA but it is soldered in place. Directions are given as to how to remove the battery prior to disposal, but Norelco could have gone the final step and made the battery replaceable. My old trimmer worked fine; only the battery needed replacing. But then again, I would guess that product longevity does not rise high on the list of marketing features."
4,"Good product, works well,","I gave this 4 stars because it does as advertised and has worked well. My only ""con"" is I use these type trimmers with the guard off sometimes. With the guard removed one cant see where they are trimming because the vaccuum area blocks the blades. Make sense? If not, sorry ;)The vacuum works well and is a very nice feature. We all know it sucks cleaning hair out of the sink.Buy it"
5,So pleased that I ordered a second one!,"I purchased this trimmer for my husband in the past. He was very impressed with the ease of use and the length of battery life after charging. My son recently requested a trimmer so, of course, I ordered him the same one. Why mess with a good thing?"
4,Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer,"Trimmer works good. Design includes a small sliding plastic guard which can be a problem when attempting to use the trimmer to 'edge' a beard, mustache or sideburns. Otherwise it works fine."
1,Piece of Fancy Junk.,"This trimmer is a joke. I purchased it to replace an older Norelco for my husband. The vacuum does catch some of the hair but there is still hair all over him and the bathroom after he has used it. He doesn't like the feel of it and he finds it difficult to get an even trim.Worse, the plastic guard broke off after six monthsThe only good thing I have to say about this trimmer is it holds a charge for seemingly forever.Purchase a different trimmer, this one is not as good as you hope it will be."
3,"Great Price, but short on delivery","Price was definitely right. Vacuum seems to work well enough, but the trimmer itself is awkward to use. I've only used it three times and I'm still trying to get the trim length right."
5,Wish I had purchased this sooner,"I grew a goatee a couple of years ago and was using what I thought was a decent groomer. That perspective changed once I started using the T980 Turbo. What a difference! It has dramatically cut the amount of time that it takes to groom my goatee. And it's more comfortable and much more accurate for a far superior result. Plus, this one does a great job of catching all of the clippings making it a very clean and effortless experience."
4,"Very nice, but...","I own an earlier model, which I prefer, but the battery died. The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it. Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length. Turbo speed is really not necessary. Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style. Overall, I feel it will work well but I am leary of the shavings door. It does a nice job, as I expected. I have no experience with any other brand to compare. I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket."
2,Not good for hair cutting.,"If you are going to cut hair, don't buy this one. It is not strong enough to cut through thick hair. Also you have to constantly clean the vacuum chamber that gets full so fast."
5,Best Beard Trimmer Ever,"I've worn a beard for over twenty five years and have used many types of trimmers--plug-in, cordless, scissors, and this is the best yet. It has the power of a plug-in trimmer, the convenience of a cordless, and the precision of scissors. The vacuum feature really does work, and the waste receptacle is easy to clean. In short, I can find only positive to say about this trimmer and I'm very glad that I bought it."
4,It does a decent job,"I always wondered how my doctor maintained that ""I just shaved yesterday"" look, now I know."
1,"Completely useless as a trimmer, would not buy","Not sure how this thing got so many good reviews. The device is completely useless at trimming my beard, and only works on the lowest setting (which is a really close trim). Literally on any setting past the shortest setting, it won't actually trim any hair.Not sure who designed the springy gaurd but its clear just from looking at it that none of the hair actually gets close enough to the blades to get cut.I have an old razor that plugs in and has 3 or 4 different adapters, and that works a lot better.When it does cut, on the really short setting, the vacuum does actually work, but theres a plastic thing that gets in the way and makes it tough to shave with any accuracy.Anyway, hope to prevent people from having the same frustrations I have after spending $40 for something that could barely shave your head much less something a bit more technical, like your face!"
4,Norelco trimmer,"My previous trimmer was a Norelco T7500 which I have used for the last 7 or 8 years. I had to replace the battery once. That is all I ever had to do to it. This battery is about shot and the trimmer is getting old so I thought to replace it rather than putting another battery in it. I chose the Norelco T980 trimmer. I am pretty much bald except for around the back and sides so I use the trimmer as my hair clipper. Because of the vacuum, it is noiser than the other trimmer but it collects all the hair, so that more than makes up for the noise. To use the nose/ear trimmer you have to pull off the clipper head and install the trimmer head. With the older model you merely slid the trimmer forward. All in all I am pleased with the new model."
2,not so great,"this shaver gets clogged very easily and if you want to make precise trims, you need to remove the one attachment and add the smaller one on. it cuts well, but is a messy process to change.if you have more then like 1/8 inch of hair on your face, i would not get this.i bought it a few months ago and now and just going to buy a regular one. the vacuum feature is pretty worthless. you end up dropping less hair below you, but over a bigger radius, so it makes more mess.this will really clog up and create a super mess if you try to use it when your hair is the least bit wet."
5,Just what I was looking for,"My husband had one of these and our son uses it all the time, so I wanted to get him his own for Christmas. Timely delivery and just what I wanted (couldn't find in stores anywhere)."
3,Philips Norelco T980,"The Vacuum Trimmer is a good idea. It actually works. It doesnt get everything but most of it. The turbo is a bit loud but trust me its not the end of world. Any trimmer is going to make noise. Speaking from an African-American, the trimmer just doesnt give me that smooth trim i have with my current""Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer"". I cant speak for all men because all hair is different but speaking for most African Americans, it wouldnt work well. The coreless feature and Vacuum is awesome, but i need a little bit more.Smooth transaction. Shipping was fast."
4,Great trimmer but for one issue,"This is easily the best beard trimmer in the market, I've been through a lot of cheaper alternatives and none do the job as well as this one. I particularly like the fact that it charges whilst you're trimming so you don't have to remember to charge it up beforehand. The blades have not dulled for me after 1 year of operation (I use it every other day) and I have relatively thicker hair somewhere between light European and African thickness. Only one problem which was quite annoying was that the plastic vacuum chamber cover somehow cracked and separated from its joins within a couple of weeks of purchasing. I lost my trimmer now when we moved out of our apartment, but I'm going to buy an identical replacement."
3,Norelco Beard Trimmer,"I purchased the Philips Norelco 7980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a couple of weeks ago and really like it.It does indeed capture pretty much all of the cut hair which saves clean-up time afterwards. And the turbo feature does work, kicking up the speed much faster to trim you beard in no time. The only downside, and a small one at that, was the learning curve for figuring out how to take off and replace the different heads but that's no longer a problem. Buy it, you'll like it!"
3,Not what I hoped for,"It's not a bad trimmer, but it's not what I was hoping for when I bought it. I suppose my biggest complaint is how messy it is. I was really looking forward to the vacuum feature but doesn't work particularly well for me. Sure, it collects some hair, but plenty more ends up on the sink and the floor. I was hoping to make trimming a no-cleanup operation. Alas.Beyond that, seems to work as advertised. I haven't had any problems with it yet, but I don't think there's much advantage to it vs my old, clumsy trimmer."
3,A Slight Improvement,"This unit replaces a T990 in which the battery died much too early. Unfortunately with ni-cad batteries you cannot use the unit even with direct power from the charger unit after the battery is dead.The T980 has the same old battery technology, and that is the reason for my mediocre rating.The slight improvement is the vacuum chamber, which catches about 85% of the clippings. However, having to change the mustache and beard blades manually is much less convenient than the pop-up mustache trimmer on the T990.Come on, Norelco/Phillips! Let's get with the new tech. in batteries, or at least design a by-pass circuit so that the unit can be powered directly from an outlet."
2,Didn't work,"Product received in non-working condition. It would not turn on. Return from Amazon was a non-issue, easily handled."
4,A neat solution for trimming mustaches and beards,"I bought this trimmer for my husband because it's so annoying to see all the little hairs on the sink after he trims his mustache, sideburns, etc. This unit has a handy little vacuum inside of it that gets almost all of the stray hairs. For me, that's a 5 star feature. My husband's only complaint is that it's a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can't just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic so the blades are exposed, but has to replace the guard with a smaller head that has exposed blades that made for this purpose.Some reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes. It doesn't wake me up if the bathroom door is open to the bedroom and I'm still asleep. Whatever extra noise is probably due to the vacuum feature. So we'd say that while it's not perfect, it's a pretty good trimmer."
4,Coldplay's favorite Satriani CD :),...and I like it too! After all the news lately went back and listened to this CD. Much stronger than I remembered. Interestingly enough 'Viva La Vida' translates to 'subconsciously steal a melody'.
2,Easy listening hard rock,"Bland offering from the electric guitar virtuoso is not without it's spectacular moments of soloing grandeur, though Satriani's penchant for sucky rhythm-based guidance along with some ill-advised vocal indulgences often kills any gaining momentum. He attempts to somewhat atone for this late in the game but it comes too little, too late."
3,Good for those who already have a background in the language,"As a U.S. born Polak, I have always wanted to learn the language and did not want to spend the money on a product like Rosetta Stone so naturally books would be something to try. This book is excellent with teaching the grammar of the language and allowing you to fully understand how Polish works. There are plenty of exercises to practice, more than enough in fact. The only downside to this workbook is that there are a large amount of undefined words used in the later chapters.This book works wonderfully, but if you do not know the definitions of some everyday words already, or some non-everyday words. Do yourself the favor and have a Polish-English dictionary handy because you will need it."
1,SAFETY HAZARD,While watching the news this evening I saw a broadcast of the Top 10 Hazardous Toys for 2005. This product was on the list for causing severe damage if a child hits another child or a pet. The blunt force can be very serious. I have seen this product in the stores for many weeks now and am sure many have been bought with the hype of the movie. I would say after seeing the news this evening and hearing the injuries that could be caused this product should be off the shelves immediately. I was surprised that ToysRUs still had it on the website for sale.
5,Dog the Bounty Hunter Season 1 & 2,This is an excellent show. This dvd set is one of my favorites!!! It will be watched again and again!!!
3,Quick reference book,Good book to have with you and puppy to refer to on a daily basis. Good pictures on training techniques.
3,Not ideal for incubators.,"I bought this to use to regulate my heat source in my home made incubator. In just one night I already know this will not work. Despite saying it has a temperature rangs of 70-110, the lowest setting, connected with my heat cable, yeilds me a temp of 105 in my incubator....way to hot! I do think this thermostat would be just fine for heating an aquarium or other reptile enclosure. However for an incubator, I suggest spending the money on something very accurate. I myself am buying my second Vivarium Electronics. I have one that runs my tubs, and will now have one for my incubator. This thermostat has a time and place, just not in an incubator."
4,Works Well,"The thermostat works well. It could use a temp readout, but is consistent regardless. I used it in a poultry brooder and am very satisfied with the results"
5,Beautiful Piece,"My husband and I are Alabama fans, so I was thrilled to find this piece listed on Amazon. I placed my order, and I was able to receive this item through expedited shipping. When the item arrived, I was impressed with the quality, as is expected when buying any piece made by Arthur Court. I look forward to using our new addition this weekend for the Arkansas game. Highly recommend!"
1,Rubbish,"What an absolute waste of time. Totally lacking in user friendly tools. Class A crap. I paid for it. At least if i""d bought the disk, it might have been useful as a christmas tree decoration."
2,Reluctant Suitor,I did not like this book. After a few chapters I could see that it was too explicit in it's sexual content for me and that it was a mindless book with a plot and outcome that was not worth my while. I deleted it from my Kindle.
1,Help! I'm drowning...,"In terrible prose, jaded phrases and ""limpid pools."" I have been trying to read this for more than a week and I am only 1/3 of the way through this Charlie Foxtrot mess of a ""story"" and I can't hold my breath any longer.I usually read while I am making supper, and previously have scorched, burned, boiled-over and lit my stove top on fire while engrossed in a KEW story. Not this time, I find I have no problem putting this over-long and descriptive stinker down.If you are a KEW fan, borrow this book, or buy it used. I got it at a used book sale. The fact that it still looks brand new should have tipped me off..."
2,What happened?,"Although I stopped reading this type of romance novel many years ago, Kathleen Woodiwiss has always been a favoite of mine, so when I saw her new book, I bought it. I loved Shanna and several of her other books, so I anticipated a happy reading experience. Not so. Ponderous is the best word I can use to describe the heavy handed vocabulary Ms Woodiwiss chose to use in this book. By the end, I felt that if I read the word ""orb"" one more time, either to describe eyes or breasts, I would scream. And why so many adjectives? Why can't they just be eyes, instead of glowing orbs? Get over the excess verbage and stick to the story next time."
1,What Happened???,"After reading such amazing books as The Elusive Flame and A Rose in Winter, I was excited when I settled into my favorite chair and picked up this newest one. After the first chapter, I was sorely disappointed. This was nothing like KW's normal writing style. Everything seemed overly dramatic and unreal. Perhaps even a bit forced. I had to force myself to even get through the first few chapters. I am about 1/2 way through and still have yet to finish it. Me, who blew through The Flame and the Flower, along with The Elusive Flame both in the same day. I am highly disappointed with this book and I hope by the next one she is back to her normal self. I want my old KW back!"
1,Trite... Clicheed...,"This is the WORST Kathleen Woodiwiss novel yet! Hackneyed and full of cliches, it is a chore to read this book. I do not know why I keep going back to it! Perhaps because I so admire her earlier works, such as ""Wolf and the Dove,"" and ""Shanna."" This book, however, is so mired in the superficial beauty of its characters that no attention is payed to any sense of plot or (God Forbid) believability. If I read one more line about deep gray orbs, I may give in to temptation and allow my puppy to use the book as a teething toy."
1,I was SO disappointed!,"Kathleen Woodiwiss was the author who introduced me to the historical romance genre and I have loved her books...until The Reluctuant Suitor. As one person asked and I agree, has she lost all respect for her readers' intelligence? Her sentences ramble and become confusing and her use of pronouns has one constantly attempting just to whom she is referring. The story line is similar to her others and that in itself is enough to deem it boring but the writing makes it even more so...and her characters could be plucked from so many other historical romances that there was nothing about them that held my interest. It was all I could do to finish the book and after I had I was angry with myself that I had wasted my valuable time."
2,Too Much Prose,"This was my first Woodiwiss book and it might be my last. She was way too descriptive in her writing. I definitely need dialogue to keep me involved in the story. It was so hard to get past those first pages. The story itself wasn't great either. I didn't understand why Colton would all of a sudden desire Adriana and why she would be so upset with him. She was SIX when he left!! That was the most baffling thing. The way Ms. Woodiwiss wrote the story, it sounded as if Adriana was heartbroken that her teenage crush had left, but no, she was only a baby. It just made no sense. I continually skipped over all the parts with Felicity and Roger. Overall, this was a horribly developed book and I am glad I only borrowed it from the library."
3,the reluctant suitor,i have all of kathleen woodiwiss's books and they are among the ones i read over and over again. this was not one of my favorites. it seemed a little convoluted at times.
4,Two Stubborn Hearts giving into Destiny,"Another classic love story to carry on through the ages. KEW's descriptions of Love, Lust and Undeniable Chemistry has my heart yearning for more...Betrothed since childhood Adriana and Colton are destined to be together, Although Colton denies that fact he leaves his family and a heartbroken Adriana behind to follow his own path in life .Years Later , Colton has returned home and is instantly smitten with the very beautiful Adriana, who has many suitors vying for her hand. Colton is reluctant at first but decides he will court Adriana for a period of 90 days to prove that love cannot be forced, as Adriana tries hard not to fall in love with the man she idolized since childhood, her passion is awakened by the one who once scorned her. Colton's lusts are awaken by the enchanting beauty, but his stubborn heart won't give in ..until a rivals treachery threatens his very possible happy ending."
2,Below Woodiwiss Standard,"Kathleen Woodiwiss took too long to develop her plot in her latest novel. It is not up to the standard of The Flame and The Flower, The Wolf and the Dove or Shanna. Numerous times Ms. Woodiwiss repeated herself and the book seemed to drag. I always wait for her latest edition, but I was really disappointed with this one."
1,Really shocked....,"After many years of not reading romances I picked up this book and really regret it.This is not the Kathleen Woodiwiss I remember....The characters are okay. However the book is long, draggy, and has way too many subplots. Including an ""evil villan"" that abuses women. If I am reading a romance I don't like to read about ""abuse"".I am really shocked that Ms. Woodiwiss wrote this. All of her other books ahve been so wonderful."
1,What the heck is this?,"I am 10 pages into the book. If this author isn't kidding, this is one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read! The prose is ludicrous, and if she mentions eyebrows one more time I'm going to scream. I am a fan of historical fiction, such as those written by Norah Lofts. This is just drivel......"
1,Pedantic dialogue was the high point of this awful book.,This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. The characters were all annoying. The interaction between the two main characters was stilted and unbelieveable. The hero focused on the heroine's appearance rather than her inner self. I would have given this book zero stars if I could have.
1,Wow ..I thought it was just me,"I was in for a long Doctor visit, (no appointment) so I knew I would be waiting forever..So I grabbed this book from home, thinking, hey Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, I will never notice the long wait...OMG it was awful...It was so full of detail, wasted detail... that meant nothing. I finally put the book away, and played solitaire on my cell phone. I love you Ms Woodiwiss..but this book was so unlike any you have written. It was just boring.I am glad someone liked it...I think getting it from your library was a good thing....you didn't have to spend a dime."
1,what a disappointment,"I had read all of Kathleen Woodiwiss's books years ago. When she finally came out with a new one, I was excited, hoping to be taken back again. This book just plain stunk! I was terribly disappointed from the opening pages. What struck me right off the bat was how there were these family dogs that were 17 years old and STIll alive and very active, having remembered Colton from when they were puppies! THAT is what made think that this is stupid. The things that were happening throughout the book were just so farfetched that I wondered if I was reading a regency romance or a book with superheroes in it. I had a really hard time getting through this book and I think that if Woodiwiss writes anything else, I'll just pass on it."
5,Wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful book for any adoptive family. It really helps family members (aunts, uncles, grandparents) as well as friends understand the process and the entire experience. My family members who have read the book thought it was ""great because there were questions answered that I didn't want to ask you, too embarrassing!"""
1,"Weak scholarship but trendy for being anecdotal, revealing","I do not recommend this book. I feel it is not intellectually rigorous, and makes dangerous parallels between the author's relationship (as a white, college educated woman with financial resources) and the relationships in which women in poverty may experience physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Also it was insensitive to the fact that race plays a role in these dynamics - perhaps the author didn't feel she could speak to this personally; but then her approach should have been much less grandiose and over-arching.Instead on intimate partner violence, I recommend:America's Dream. Esmeralda Santiago.The Turkish Lover.Black and Blue. Anna QuindlenTrash. Dorothy AllisonBastard Out of Carolina.Push. Sapphire.Chain, Chain, Change. Evelyn White."
3,"Good read and learned quite a bit but,,,,,","Good book and learned quite a bit but,,,got bored with it. Not sure why, but after 3/4 through the book I felt I was reading the same stuff. Could have been shorter but I am not much of a reader so others may not agree."
2,Red text on a kindle makes for poor contrast.,"Red text on a black and white kindle means you're reading gray words.I'm still trying to read this book, and can't speak to the efficacy of the authors philosophy, but I can tell you that whatever idiot decided the entire text of this book should be the color red should be fired. I had to increase the text size two levels just to read it."
4,An old tried text,This introductory Latin text is one that has been around awhile and is a tried and true method of learning. While not a text that lends itself to the independent learning if working in a group or with a teacher is an excellant book.
2,Another free bad kindle book,"I typically read all books cover to cover, but not this one. Couldn't finish it. The plot was stupid and reminded me of some really, really bad porno films - a stupid story line mixed with sex scenes."
3,Forgettable,"Enjoyed it while reading. The characters were fun. The plot moved swiftly.And I started forgetting it the moment I put my Kindle to sleep. Would recommend for a fun beach read, but skip it if you are in the mood for something with any depth."
1,Bad Read,"Truthfully, this book was so erotic I couldn't finish it. I read about half of the book before I just couldn't read it anymore. Basically Penelope just sits in Prince Charming's lap, NOT playing hard to get. Half the book is them having sex and ""trying"" to resist eachother, but in the end just having sex. The story then further irritated and disgusted me by having them get married becuase they ""just couldn't live witout eachother"", even though they've only known eachother for about a week. Ugh. And then to confuse readers even more, at their wedding, some beast comes flying to kill the Prince ( or whatever his name is). At that point, I just couldn't read this book anymore. It's bad enough that Penelope didn't have a backbone, and now flying creatures come out of nowhere. I really would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,The Beanie Invasion is the best Beanie Book on the market!,"Janie Daniels' book the Beanie Invasion is excellent! My whole family really enjoyed it! It is truely the BEST Beanie book on the market. Mrs. Daniels does not make random predictions or create information like many of the other Beanie authors. Mrs. Daniels adds a very personal touch to her book looking at the whole Beanie craze through the eyes of both children and adults. It is well written and very creatively laid out. I can tell Mrs. Daniels wrote this book from her heart. You can also tell right away that she genuinely loves children! My children all adored the beautifully creative photographs!!! They were so much fun they spent hours looking thorough the book admiring them! Thank-you Mrs. Daniels for sharing your book the Beanie Invasion with all of us! It is a well written, fun book for the whole family!"
5,A stunning album,"Having been a fan of Magnum's for over ten years, I was apprehensive as to how Bob would manage without his right-hand-man from Magnum, guitarist and songwriter Tony Clarkin.I need not have worried - some of the tracks on this album IMHO are even better than anything Magnum ever recorded. Highlights are A beautiful night for love, Shelter from the night, and Where the Heart is.Pure brilliance."

3,"Nice simple exercises, no English answer key.","This is a reprint of a 1911 school book. Back then Greek was a big part of English high school studies. The authors found that even the most basic Read Greek books were too advanced, so they wrote this book of elementary exercises. It's full of hundreds of short, basic, Attic and Homeric sentences and paragraphs for you to translate -- just the sort of practice you need to get the basics in your brain. This would be an excellent part of a formal curriculum, one in which someone went over the correct answers with you.Unfortunately for self-learners, THERE IS NO KEY giving the English translations. I've searched the web, and can't find one there either. This, in my opinion, severely limits the usefulness of the book.Still, it is cheap, so it's probably worth buying."
1,Racism is alive today,"I tried to read parts of this book, for free reading on internet. And far before to read even 5% of this trash, I decided to end the reading. This book has the absurd claim that Greek civilization was founded by black Africans. And uses togues' similarities between Greek and Phoenicians as the the proof of this ""fact"".In fact Phoenicians weren't black and the same is true about the majority of the Egipticians. When we compare black African tongues and Greek, we found there's no real link between them.The author is an American racist, looking for money and fame, writing this kind of trash-book.If he really wanted to shows to real contributions of black Africans to mankind, he would be showed things, such as the commercial sorghum."

1,Exit Strategy,"This was the worst movie I have ever spent money on. I delete immediately after watching it. It was just dumb dumb dumb!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could have gotten my money back right away. I didn't want to give it a 1 star, but the rating wouldn't let move unless I rated it. I wish I give this movie a minus --------"
1,More Blame,"This is a horrible book with nothing new to offer and more of the same excuses we've come to expect from the right-wing media. Just read some of the pro-reviews and you'll see the usual liberal bashing; the God is on my side absurdity; and the constant blame everybody else for all that is wrong with our country. Seems a lot of people have fogot about our birth. Obviously, if we all believed in ""My country, right or wrong"", we'd all still be British subjects. Love live dissent and those who have the courage to display it."
1,"Miss me yet? Hell, no!","Just read how G.W.Bush, the first appointed president, has the lowest approval rating of any former living president. Now the 1-star ratings outnumber all the higher star ratings, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents. Am also wondering if those who bought this book in the past and once believed what it said can get their money back?"
1,"Responce To ""Response to ""Witless Celebrity Bio.""""",No one has ever had more contempt for the people than the bush administration.
5,Can't beat the price!!,"This is an excellent math book, as a supplement or as the main body of work. I use it to home school my 10 year old, and am very pleased with the math problems in the book and the way it is presented!"
1,Back-ordered,"Have not received item yet. It has been back-ordered since I purchased it. I do keep getting nice emails asking if I want to continue to wait, but the health dept is going to condemn my house if I don't get a vacuum soon!"
2,Universal Pole Sander by Allway,"Item is very sturdy, the pivot head moves around pretty freely.Has a rubber bottom not foam like some.Reason for the two stars. . . the sander arrived with a convex bottom. I press down on one corner and the other corner lifts of the table by a good 1/4""Currently trying to heat the plastic with a heat gun then clamping it down to a straight edge board to correct."
2,"I hate to be the naysayer here, but ""What's the Big Deal?""","This is my least favorite CD out of the Ministry of Sound Sessions series. It was made in 1994 and I really don't think it showcases Oakenfold's talent. The only two tracks that stand out on this compilation are ""(Who?) Keeps Changing Your Mind"" and ""Who Dares to Believe in Me?"". Also, ""There But for the Grace of God"" is a great track as well. These three tracks are considered classics for good reason. Strong bass lines and refrains and choruses that are not easy to forget. Other than that, the rest of the CD is forgettable. If you want to hear Oakenfold at his best, please check out his later work from ""Tranceport"" and ""Global Underground"". To be honest with you, Paul Oakenfold is not one of my favorite DJs, however, Sessions 2 doesn't do him justice at all. Thank goodness Paul has done much better than this in more recent years."
4,Does the job!,They processed & shipped this item the same day. Item does a good job on saving my battery from dying!! Usually shuts off at 11.5.
3,nice little tea pot,"I like these little tea pots. I have them in 4 different colors. The infuser does get hot and make it a bit difficult to take out. And on the last one I ordered the lid was somehow screwed on wrong, so it won't stay up but keeps falling shut."
4,"Good little teapot, short and stout","When brewing for two (or three smaller servings or just extra for yourself) the Stump is a good way to go. I only have two, albeit minor, complaints: 1) You can't remove the lid, which makes it difficult to position in the dishwasher, and 2) I wish the mesh infuser basket were a little deeper so that you could brew smaller amounts. As it is the water for a single cup would not be deep enough to even reach the basket, so for single cups, I'm still using myAdagio Teas Ingenuitea Teapot.That said, this is a very nice, well-made product. If my Stump teapot were accidentally broken -- though that would probably be difficult to do -- I'd definitely buy another. And I expect I'll be purchasing other ForLife tea products in the future."
5,Oil of oregano,"This product is wonderful, I have ordered it several times , the cost is also a key point for me ."
1,Women I missed in this novel!!!,"I am very asthonished, Hustvedt mentions more than 100 important people in Science, Fine Art, Literature ... but only men, no women. Why? Is our world so andro-centric? Or only Leo the protagonist?Why Hustvedt developes Marks behavior as a typical borderline personality point by point (see the Theory of Sternberg). It is a little bit boring and like a psychological story, not a novel!I am angry about the missing women in the novel and angry because nobody of the readers sees it. Hustvedt did it too secretly."
2,touching to tabloid,"I'm baffled by the reviews of this book. The first part was in fact touching, but then...But then the second half is barely a notch above Law & Order. It's a veiled (very thinly) retelling of the New York ""Clubland Murders"" from the late 90's. See the book/film ""Party Monster."" I guess I just found that to distracting to become invested in the second half. It was just wierd to have this go from touching to tabloid. Does Michael Alig get royalties? And what's up with the American Psycho reference, and calling it ""Psycho Land."""
4,Making Augustine a Human Being,"I read Brown's book as part of a raft of books on theology and Christian history during my studies. Most of the books are dreadful, or just mildly interesting. This book stands out of the crowd. I felt like I knew Augustine, or at least understood his character and times, after reading this book. It seems I am in good company in thinking of this as a classic."
5,Free!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Best album I have purchased in a year and it is free! Everyone who hears it loves this album.
4,Good Purchase,"This is a great cd, a little slower and more mellow than previous cd's but still worth the buy."
2,Needs serious editorial help,"I purchased this work from the author on Kauai at a book signing in 1997 and finally got around to reading it in 2001 after returning to Kauai to live. Mary's story is entertaining but reading the book is exasperating to any person with even a little editorial skill.The book is rife with misspellings (including the female lead), incorrect word usages (triad vs. tirade), grammatical blunders abound, and at one point the author moves from winter to summer in the blink of an eye leaving the reader wondering what time of year the story is really taking place.More time and effort in the editorial process would have produced a quick, easy, enjoyable read. Unfortunately, or possibly FORTUNATELY, the reader is left with the impression ""I can write better than that"", which may inspire would-be writers.All in all, a good story with no visible editing."
1,Disjointed and juvenile level of description,"I'd give it no stars if offered the choice. This is the second novel by this author I've attempted to read. ""Attempted"", and not read in full, as her truly juvenile style is difficult to focus on. Possibly she is writing at a level appreciated by regular online denizens, with her overuse of vague superlatives. Endless referring to the hero or his smile as ""sexy"" is just not enough detail. (She does the same thing in ""Mine to Take"".) Two novels of dumb heroines, who let themselves be lead into various actions by the hero (uh, after saying ""no'), means I won't be back."
3,Misleading!,"Orion Ensemble and Cedille Records are to be congratulated for offering two interesting and neglected pieces from the late Romantic period. At least in the case of the Rabl, however, this is NOT a world premiere recording, as Cedille persists in claiming at its website (and see description, above). This well-crafted quartet, by a composer who was a mere twenty-three years old, prefigures the instrumentation famously used in Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps, and also in a quartet by Hindemith (1938). It is enormously engaging, and deserves a secure place in the repertoire. The performance here is adequate, but what appears to be the real world premiere recording (Ensemble Kontraste; Thorofon B00000IFN9, released in 1999) is fresher, more spirited, and more deeply etched. The Kontraste recording is also, I think, better engineered. All that said, I very pleased to own both CDs!"
5,Classic Norton,"Aliens! Spaceships! Blasters, and Telepathy! Just a few of the elements of Norton's stories that enthralled me as a young teenager an even now as a much older adult. So glad to have access to such literature via my kindle!"
3,Short answer...it's free...get it.,"I read this book as a child and there it was available for free on Kindle and we were on vacation so I down loaded it. Difference obviously between my reading it as a child and then again 40+ years later, but I still like sci fi. It's a good NOT GREAT book...but the price is right and it's a fast read. In 40 more years, I'll read it again :-)."
1,Amazon blows chunks,I never recieved this order. Amazon is retarded. How hard is it to deliver something? i want my @#$@ money back. NOW!
1,buyer beware,"Not only does the tank leak, but the filter failed (cracked) while we were on vacation resulting in a $20,000 insurance claim replacing our kitchen floor. I love the concept, use it almost everyday, but I'm buying another brand for replacement."
3,Improved - hopefully,"The last two versions rusted out in 2-3 years but this one has a stainless steel tank. About time. They couldn't figure that out 10 years ago? On a less positive note, I couldn't install this myself because the new model needs a larger hole in the countertop and for that you need a diamond drill bit. The new spout is shorter than the old model and barely fits over the sink basin which may be a problem filling some containers. Finally, the heater seems to run a lot even on low temperature (and it's noisy). All in all a disappointment so far."
1,Unreliable and over priced,"First tank failed after about a 1 1/2 years. Replacement tank failed after another year. Still have a few months on left on the 3 year warranty but I'm not going to bother because it is a badly designed product. Even when new, the flow rate is not that good due to very narrow inlet that clogs if you have hard water. Also the vent piping inside kinks due to a bad and cheaply made housing design. So I had to periodically maintain this until the heater or thermal switch failed. I replaced it a Quick&Hot brand. I don't know if it will last but it was less than 1/2 the cost and it is a simpler open vent design with a much higher flow rate. - Phil"
5,Very detailed DYI,"This DYI is very detailed and explains everything you'll need to know to create a beautiful moonlight. He gives you ideas to creat own ideas for what you want. High recommended, for any person to buy."
2,Making sense of what gurus?,"By its title and the accompanying description, one would suppose this would be an objective and critical look at management gurus through history, with emphasis on the current ones. Instead, we get one chapter each on two gurus and a scathing review on the current management craze (which in itself is now a fad). Unfortunately, the argument against the ""fad"" is based on incorrect assumptions. Those subjects take up the first 100 pages, and then the authors ramble off for 200+ pages into disparate subjects and try to establish their own theories. Although most of what they say is correct, these are not necessarily the burning issues or the best characterization of the ones they do discuss. In fact, this effort is no better than a lot of what they want to criticize. Not worth buying unless you are interested in reading everything in the field."
4,Pundits are lower on the food chain than gurus.,"I will admit my opinion is possibly half baked since I've read but half of this book. But then, I have been seeing the authors or hearing them everywhere. It occurs to me that the only spectre more unsettling to a business man than a twenty-or-thirty-something-MBA-in-a-dark-suit proclaiming eternal verities to one's subordinates is a twenty-or-thirty-something-junior-editor-come-pundit-on-sabattical-in-a-dark-suit proclaiming eternal verities to the universe. Nevertheless, if this one more book finally convinces readers to abandon the conceits of the machine age, then gung-ho for them"
2,sorry pals. maybe next time,"It is mentioned in this book that management books are hardly ever read completely. I have finished almost all the management books I started reading; however, this is one of the rare books I abandoned reading. Boring, unproductive, waste of time..."
2,A book for the victims,"If you are a victim of corporate downsizing, then this book is for you. It will make you feel better.If you are a seasoned manager, this book has very little to offer you. The book is neither very insightful or inspiring.I only give it a ranking of ""2 stars"" (To me 1 star = rubbish) because it is still a serious work. i.e. you can see the authors have spent time to research for ""company names"" to support their arguments. But, isn't that what all serious journalists do?"
2,Aimless - AS I SEE IT,"I bought this book at the Singapore airport on my way to London, hoping to spend my time on the flight productively. Being an MBA and a business consultant myself I was fairly familiar with some of the names mentioned in the book. But after a while I noticed that the authors were meandering and becoming somewhat aimless. I put the book aside, dissappointed."
2,A Frothy Mess,"Poor Herb. Someone must have convinced him he could earn a retirement lump sum and a little credibility by participating in this farrago. Simply, this is yet another fizzed-up remix compilation that mostly detracts from the cheesy original. And let's be clear: the original was a huge mainstream success which never approached even the fringes of hipness. The only track on Rewhipped which truly messes and transforms an original is Love Potion 9: the new version adds vocals to the original instrumental and actually manages to sound funky."
1,REWHIPPED? SOMEONE SHOULD BE HORSEWHIPPED!,What the hell is this!!??? Having a Musical ear and judging by what I've heard on the samples.......I've heard enough! This is fabricated bolderdash from beginning to end! 60 lashes! Please stop this kind of garbage! If it ain't broke.........!
1,Trash,After hearing A Taste of Honey I couldn't subject my ears to this madness any longer. It's like trading in the Mona Lisa for a coloring book version. Maybe Herb blew his wad and attempting to refill his $$$ coffers. The original album is a legend.
1,Take my CD..PLEASE,"I am an old fan of Herb Alpert, both when he was with the TJB and on his own. The thing which makes his music so incredible is how alive and progressive it was for the time. So when I purchased this CD I was full of anticipation. The result: It's new, alright...and like all rap/r&b adulterations of old songs, this one is simply tragic. It lacks any heart, and sounds more like a contemporary muzak than anything I could possibly sit down and enjoy. It's my last Herb Alpert purchase without previewing a CD...and if you want my copy of this remix, you're welcome to it. I won't be playing it again."
1,Rancid Cream,"How to distroy a classic album:1)Get trendy, over boomy, monotonous rhythm track2)Slap onto classic album, mix to front, push classic track somewhere in the distant back and randomly intersperse3)Rent girl, buy can of shaving cream for cover."
3,New is not always better,"I really enjoyed the Rewhipped disk, but am not sure that any tracks were necessarily improved. Sure, they had a fresh approach, and Herb himself played some new licks, but I am still partial to the original. I recommend buying both for your own comparison, because I don't feel the Rewhipped is stong enough to stand on its own."
3,Interesting but can't top the original,"There are some interesting interpretations here of the songs from the classic ""Whipped Cream and Other Delights"", but none of them are as good or better than the originals. If you haven't heard the classic TJB albums in a while, listen to them again. They're truly timeless, no remixing necessary."
4,Reviews for the wrong album,Sparkmeister must have meant to post that review for another album because there is no hip-hop or rap on Rewhipped. Maybe he's confusing this with Sergio Mendes 'Timeless'...?
1,Toys for Young Boys,"Bought this gift for my young son, who just turned 5, loves to play cooking games and let's play restaurant taking your orders. And we thought since the product was coming from a brain trust company that it would be great. It was not great...all of the products were very cheaply made in China and some of the pieces were missing and/or the wrong pieces were included in the packaging. I contacted the company/distributor and they backed their guarantee and gave me full credit. They also directed me to a website for all games made in the USA that they sell and distribute. Although found the Let's Play Restaurant well below acceptable standards, I thought the company involved acted honestly and professionally and I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again..but buy American."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS BOOK!","Stop! Don't buy this book!What Amazon/Random House FAILS explain is that this is NOT the original text, as written in 1989.Half the original verse is missing!And, whatever IS there, is out of sequence and makes no sense at all.It is completely awful.Shame on Random House!The original book, copywrite 1989, is wonderful, a rare delight. We have our taped-up copy, still, and even though our kids are way too old for it, we will never give this one away. It was an all-time favorite in our house for many, many years.The prose on the original book is lovely, with a musical cadence, and my husband and I can still recite the words.This new ""chunky"" book is an abomination.Oh, and the original was Made in America. Sigh. Those were the days."
4,My daughters love this book!,"Although this book is currently out of print, we received a copy as a hand-me-down and my daughters have read and re-read it so often it is now falling apart! They even remember the sounds of specfic items in the book (helicopters, a brook,) and will repeat those sounds when reading other books that repeat those words."
5,Easy fast paced reading,"I read a ton of business books and really look for stand outs. It is difficult to find something new or a different twist. This one has it! It's a quick and easy read but has lots of meat. From Donald Trump, I think I am the only person in the world that likes this guy, to Jeff Baker...all good. I am a trainer and enjoy sharing some of the stories in the book, they are useful in bringing home a point. Good job"
2,Interesting book with insight on leadership,"This was a very conversational book with good tidbits about leadership and success. I enjoyed reading it and would also recommend ""Running with the Rhinos"" by Christian Warren.Running with the Rhinos: Courageous Leadership for a Complex World"
5,Sahara,"A really fun movie about WW II North African warefare when the allies were having problems. It shows a grant/lee tank which is very cool and soem fine action. Recognizable actors, some is different roles than you are familiar with.Bogart is as tough and as soft as ever.One of my old time favorites."
4,Laverda Twins and Triples,"Author Mick Walker, a man who is passionate about Italian motorcycles, takes a stab at the exotic Laverda twins and triples. As an owner of many of these incredible machines, I found this book to be very insightful and detail-oriented. Many great pictures, most unseen before with a fantastic color photo section. Plenty of new information. A must-have for the Laverda owner or for those who desire to own one."
5,MIX ALBUM....(in good taste),"This CD is a 1 track, 67 minute, testimate to the superhuman mixing abilities of DJ Shadow (Mr. Davis). Whoda thunk it?"
1,not your typical shadow record,"i was skeptical from the start, it says something about reinventing hip hop on the front; but I bought it neways thinking that ne thing shadow makes is good. well i was in for a rude awakening. its all a bunch of odd ball rap songs weaved together, some new sounding/some older. i used to like rap, now i hate it. its too commercialized, there arent any ""actual"" rappers ne more, and its all about sex, every single song has something to do with gettin it on; its really quite sickening. whatever happened to nwa, pe, bdp, rundmc etc.enuf about that, this album has some newer rap songs that i have no idea what they are but they definitely suck, after that there is some old school. shadow doesnt do much scratching or nething really. the one bright spot is an old too short song.i would advise against buying this album, save your money for some ""fitty cent"" or ""whatchu know about that?"" ""ringtones"""
4,Love it! Great Gift!,I think this is a great book for any college football fan. I like the way the book is organized. All the facts and memories on each stadium make it a good and easy read.
5,Sounds so real,"This thing is real easy to use & can project sound over long distances. I live in the Sierras and this call has brought both turkey and hunters in. Yes, my nieghbors far off heard me sounding off and came looking lol."
4,For fans of Atom Heart Mother,"A great companion disc to Atom Heart Mother on which Ron Geesin also collaborated. Songs range from sound effects to songs like ""Sea Shell and Stone"" similar to grantchester meadows (on Ummagumma studio album). ""Body transport"" is very amusing.Highly recommended for anyone who liked Atom Heart Mother"
5,"""Bye, bye love""....","Loved the DVD and this CD is just as entertaining. George Benson oozes showmanship so much so that it comes across just listening. ""On Broadway and Bye bye love"" are the stand out's."
2,soft but still a liitle hot,I ordered latex because my research stated that it was not as hot as memory foam. It is still hotter than a regulat mattress. I bought another on with a fabric cover for my mother and she just loves it.
5,wonderful sleep!!,What a great way to extend the life of a mattress! This topper will last until we have to buy a new mattress. Then we're going to go full latex!!! Love the feel and the eco friendliness.
4,It didn't work for me,"This book might help if you use it in conjunction with the online GRE practice test. I did not do well but that was not the books fault. Lack of time and not being able to go back and change answers did me in for the bad scores. So if you are preparing for the GRE, if you are like myself and have never taken an online test with strict time limits. This is what I suggest.1. Study any GRE book - this particular one is cheaper than some others. It really doesnt matter the size.2. PRACTICE ONLINE3. Study what you missed.4. Practice ONLINE5. Practice Online again!"
4,Not interested in history?,"Iyer's book captures a particular moment in the 1980s in each of the places he visits. He acknowledges that he provides little historical context for his experiences, such as how the Indian movie industry developed as it did or why the Philippines seems lost in the relics of the by-gone rock-and-roll era. I do not recommend the book to those seeking any sort of historical explanation of what is happening in Asian/American cultural exchange, although it is (probably) quite enjoyable to everyone else."
4,Asia Travelin',"Brings back times of travel before the world learned of the Internet. True description of the oddities of Katmandu for anyone who has spent some time there. Most travelers simply pass in and out of the capital with 2-3 days on the front and/or back end of a journey. If you can take the time to soak up the side streets, meet the locals and spend time with family and children, this exciting capital offers some of the most exciting asian travel adventures...try to spend a week there if possible. A good absorbtion of the Katmandu valley for 3 weeks will bring liftime memories."
1,"Parts for a Neon, not a Mini",The directions call this out as a coil for a Neon not a Mini. The mounting is completely different than the stock hardware and it will not bolt up. You need to buy new hardware and you lose the vibration isolation that is integrated into the factory unit. No perceivable performance gains or differences in economy have been had from installation as well.
5,It Was Interesting,"I will make my review short and to the point. This particular book was unbeleivable (considering I read it back in 1998). It kept me wondering whether these stories were real. Allan Zullo, I must say, is magnificent in collecting all these stories to give ""us"" readers to enjoy."
1,well it did not work for me,What ever the problem was it didnt solve it for me. Squirrels were eating birds seeds from the tray. I use to buy fox urine at the localm sporting goods store They dont sell it anymore. So mImfound mthis product online oreder it and it was no differn tham putting Nothing to scare off the squirrles. Dont recommned it for deterring squirrels!
2,Much better books to read than this,"I couldn't even finish this book.(And I always finish books, even if they are bad) It was like the author was used to writing research papers and tried to add in some case studies to appeal to the general public and sell a book. But she failed in my opinion. It was dense but repetitive and contradicted points often. I would NOT recommend this book."
5,A must have book if adopting older children!,"This book is one that you will go back to and refer to time and time again. A very real picture of what to expect as you adopt, especially if you are adopting older children. The author speaks from experience. You can tell the depth of love she has for the job she does with children. I would recommend this book for anyone who is considering adoption!"
2,Too Clinical,"You can tell this book is written by a professional therapist. I was looking for some straight-forward, basic help. This book did not do the trick. By the time you filter through her theraputic ""mumble-jumble"", you are only left with s thimble full of helpful advise. It was not worth my time or money. Back to the drawing board!"
3,Great on detail,Very comprehensive book covering a lot of ground about the issues particular to adoption and adopted children from a psychologist perspective.
5,all women should have this,"If you own a purse then you should have a few purse hooks.I love love love mine. I own about 4 (I put one in each handbag so I don't have to transfer them) but have purchased about 10 because I keep giving them away. They are a great and inexpensive gift under $15.00 and some under $10. You'll never have to put a purse on the floor again.Just hook it to the table where you're eating, the bar where you're drinking, on a door where you going to the bathroom (you know some don't have hooks and putting that purse on the floor is just little more than disgusting).Really you won't be disappointed.why didn't I think of this?"
5,Beautiful!,"This arrived quickly and the crystal is stunningly beautiful. The lush drawstring carrying case is very nice. This won't take up too much room in a purse, as it collapses flat. It is sturdy, and holds up to what it says it does....holds a large, heavy purse with no problem!! Great choice!"
3,The Portable Dorothy Parker review,"I was a little disappointed cause it wasn't the one I was led to believe I was getting, only because the picture on the cover was different and it was smaller than I thought but other than that it was fine. It had all my favorite poems and short stories. Overall, I was very satisfied with the product."
5,The definitive Parker collection,"This edition is gorgeous, with creamy (and yes, uneven, making it easier to flip through) pages, humorous illustrations of the fiction humorist, and before-unpublished correspondence between Parker and other literati. I would think that Parker would approve of the tongue-in-cheek descriptions and comic strips of her life story. This book is a pleasure to curl up with at night and pick out stories and poems at random to enjoy again and again. Highly, highly recommended."
3,"I mean, its cool but.......","I dunno, I guess I was expecting something more musically innovative from Soulchild. If you're going to call yourself ""music"" then its time to start doing so. I'm sure he can bring more creativity and still keep it in the neo soul genre. I don't think he is fullfilling his music potential. His cd is not progressive to me it just sounds like the others. I consider Musiq an important R&B; artist to music today and he is 20 thousand times better than most of the R&B; acts out there. He has the potential to be an R&B; legend if he does not run out of creative steam!And oh, can we hear more live music please!With that said, the cd is not bad at all. I really like stepping to B.U.D.D.Y., its the perfect song to get a swingout set going! Greatest Love is a great, great song. It's one of my favorites. Like I said the cd is cool."
3,"Cringe as Buck does ""The Hustle"".","Not exactly the high point of the series it does feature an unintentional parody of the disco years here on modern day Earth. And its always nice to see Col. Wilma Deering on the dance floor. However,its the break dancing Tweeky(the little robot guy) that steals the show."
3,"I liked ""Behind the Mask of Spider-Man"" better","The first and foremost problem with this second behind the scene book of the second Spider-Man movie is that it's just too fully choked with technical aspect and the engineering of the sets and other stuff that I don't really care about. The artworks that actually show Spidey in action, or even just him alone are barely there. I wondered why they titled this book Caught in the Web then. The majority of the portion is allocated to the creation and brainstorming over Dock Ock and his tentacles. I mean, c'mon guys, I like Dock Ock but please..please show him in action with Spidey. And where are those conceptual drawings that depict the cool train fight. I noticed only one pic about it is in the book. It's just unbelievable that this comes from the same author of Behind the Mask. And lastly, where's the all important script???"
1,dont have much to say,ill just stick with 3 six mafia not sum redneck rapper named lil wyte.....sadly hes on alot of 3 six songs now...
2,I wish the other two reviews,"I wish that the two most recent reviews of this book had been written before I bought this book. This book is a waste of time. As the other two reviewers have stated, the majority of the book is stepping the user through Wizards. How anybody can call this a good book for experienced DBA's is beyond me. Anybody who is technical or has a lot of experience will find this book a waste of time and money. I will definitely be waiting for more reviews of Microsoft Press books before I buy them again in the future. I think that I must have bought this because it was one of the first books to be released on SQL 2000.If I had to say something good about this book, it is graphically pleasing. Lots of pictures of the screens as it steps you through the wizards. This book might help a lot if you're the company stud at Excel and they suddenly promote you to network administrator and you're looking at SQL for the first time.This book is defintely a newbie book."
3,Good book,It is the best book I have read for the following areas:ClustersDTCRAIDThe problem with this book is that it is a little boring.It is a good referential book. I do not recommend this book for beginners because it contains a lot of technical details.
3,A little disappointing,I have been waiting for this ironing board for a long while. It might work on carpeted floor but it slides badly on hardwood floors. Mine arrived looking a little beat up as well.
1,Absolute garbage.. I can't believe I wasted my money,This book is absolute garbage. I have actually bought this book and read it. I agree completely with the other authors talking about how confusing and impractical the instructions are. They do not make any sense. I can't believe I wasted my money on this.
1,Practical Guide to Astral Projection,"I found the author's writing style difficult to read, and the content questionable. While I do not know much about the subject, the book seemed somewhat ""occultish"" and I question the author's expertise and background on the subject. I do not recommend this book."
4,patience,"The production quality is great but, personally, I would have liked to find more exercises and moves on this dvd (this is why I gave it only 4 stars). It is just 40 minutes long. If you have never been able to hula hoop, then maybe you need patience and... a good friend. I have tried it alone and have given up after a few tries. After a couple of days I have tried again with a friend and it was much more fun: we have begun again and again and sometimes it has worked for 3-4 seconds, which I was proud of :-).Rayna suggests 'throwing' the hula hoop well the first time and shows this by moving just her arms and the hula hoop. Even without moving your hips, the hula hoop should circle around your waist or hips 2 or 3 times. I found this information helpful. While throwing the hula hoop the first time, lead it well with your hand, pressing it a little against your belly.Good luck!"
3,"Live in Moscow....""this time"" could've been a little faster","This is a great CD. Only thing I was a little disappointed with is that the version of the song ""This time"" was not the same one you hear out on the clubs or the radio and was actually a little slower than usual. I had to continue searching for the version that I love the most which is:DJ Antoine - This Time (Klaas Remix)"
5,How easy!,"Simple, easy and works perfectly. I had it checked at the hospital and it is right on. If you are looking for a way to check your blood pressure, I highly recommend this product.... It couldn't be easier to use."
1,"Inaccurate, Inconsistent, Useless BP monitor","I am a medical professional who takes BP's at work. Compaired this side by side with manual cuff monitor. Constantly gives lowered pressures, ranging from 20 to 45 mmHg lower for SBP, and about 15 to 30 for DBP. I wouldn't rely on this product."
5,We love it,This is so easy to use. I bought one for my sister in law and she loved it and it saved her life. The doctor was over medicating her for blood pressure that he thought was high. She takes her own blood pressure at home now and finds she needs no medication. She was fainting and thought it was strokes. I bought one for myself also and tested it with the Doctors office and it is very accurate. The other ones I used would not register for me.
4,Seems to work well for me!,"I got this because after my thyroid thing my BP was still high at the doctors office like 155/100 and I'm only 24 with meat on my bones (197lbs)but not obese or anything.Well, I was debating on going on some stupid BP meds my pill pushing doc prescribed, but I wanted to see if my BP would go down on it's own once my hormones balanced out with the goiter gone. Fortunately it did, and I'm pretty sure it's accurate because my BP was measuring high like it was in the doc's office, but overtime through relaxation and as symptoms got better it got down to the 130's/80's, and at times even 120's/80's.Plus, whenever I drink when the blood sugar drops this thing also registers my BP as low as 90's/50's."
2,"it,s broke","It,s a shame, but w/ everything made in china, I guess I could expect it.It,s a high dollar item & omron products used to be high quality electronic products, but i guess I,m oot 60 bucks now.I.,m dissappointed.my cheap $15 one from harbor freifgt still works, but i don,t know how accurate.Everybody,s gone the cheap route looking for t he cheapest labor market.they shouldn,t charge top dhollar for a product that isn,t bullet proof.beleive me , this wasn,t abused.omron electronics used to be top shelf."
3,Omeron,"The item it self is a good product,a little difficult to use not necessarily ment for elderly.Delivery also laged .although price was great.One of those you get what you pay for."
2,Not what I thought,I brought this item for my grandparents. It was not easy to get a reading. When you place it on the wrist it has to be in a certain spot or it won't work. Need something a little easier for my grandparents to use.
5,Love this wrist pressure monitor,"Having used several cuff-type blood pressure monitors of varying ease of use and varying accuracy (as calculated and calibrated by my doctor) this one actually is the most accurate - spot on. Its small size and ease of use encourages more frequent use as I reduce medications in response to improved diet, stress and exercise. The intellisense indicator ensures accurate readings and the memory allows you to record your history of readings without keeping a paper journal. It also gives you an average of the past three readins with the push of a button. Easy to use, easy to read, highly accurate -- an excellent choice."
4,Reliable,works well but is a little heavier than other wrist cuffs I have had. Correlates well with manual BP measurementsGood for travel
1,it was broke,"it stop working after one month, it wasnt reliable and it wasnt useful i shouldve sent it back, thank u"
2,Omron HEM_650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,"I don't find it very accurate, but my wife uses it daily and is pleased with it."
1,Numbers to small,The numbers of the display are to small for a Senior to read. Should not have bought it.
1,My monitor is about 20 points off top reading and about 20 off bottom readying,"Could I be doing something wrong. It shows my blood pressure in normal to low range but when I went to doctor today, I had the nurse to test her cuff on both arms and I used mine and mine was really off. Is there a way of regulating these."
1,No Good,"I was very upset with the way this BP monitor works. No two readings on the same person taken within a span of 5 minutes are same. In spite of boasting of the Automatic Position Sensor and other accuracy ensuring mechanism, I was disappointed. I actually ended up returning it. Its also not very easy to use. Not recommended."
2,Not accurate,"Easy to use, much more convenient then a conventional blood pressure cuffs but it reads about 10 points below of the actual blood pressure."
3,Good seller,"Product is not user friendly. To get it to work, you have to keep moving it till it begins to inflate. Have recently purchased another Omron BP652 cuff which is much better."
5,Accurate!,"I love this monitor. I have been using it now for a couple of years. I have taken it to my Drs office at her request to see if my readings at home are accurate. This monitor lined right up with the Drs office. Wrist monitors can get a bad wrap and can be discouraged to buy. This one works great!It may be a bit complicated at the beginning to find that right spot, but once you find it, it is a piece of cake!I have to admit that it gives me more piece of mind that this monitor does line up with the Drs office monitors."
5,Great gizmo,It is quick and easy to use - great for the office or travel when you need to track your pressure regularly.
4,BP monitor,"Good value, Pretty accurate, easy to use, Omron is a well known company that makes and sells quality products. That is why I purchassed it."
4,Really Good Product,As a nurse I look for products my patients can use that can test their Blood Pressure both accurately and easily. With this product it passes both tests and I believe this to be a very good tool to monitor health. The only thing I will mention and this is found will ALL automatic BP cuffs that I am familiar is that you will receive an error message if you have some types of irregular beats such a Atrial fib. For the average person with normal or high blood pressure this is a great tool to help monitor your health. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is that in my opinion an automatic cuff is not as accurate as a blood pressure taken by your physician or manually by a healthcare provider.
5,My Mom loves it,"Bought for Mom for Christmas, she loves it. I went with this over the air pressured one because who wants to feel that pressure on your arm if you dont have to right? I saw an actual doctor using this same exact one and that sold me.. Recomend highly."
1,Innaccurate monitor,"This blood pressure monitor was off by at least 15 mm Hg every time I checked its accuracy.I went to my doctors office to check it's accuracy against the nurses reading, and had an EMT friend check it also.I'm on blood pressure to keep my blood pressure down, and need to accurately check my pressure a couple of times a day. This monitor does not do the job."
3,OmronHEM-650 Wrist Blood pressure Monitor,I have had a bad time with a product I was excited to get. Those AAA batteries don't even last me 2 days. I am now taking the batteries out when I getthe day's measurement. HELP?? Dale Stuckey
2,Not for the confused or elderly,"I purchased this product to use with my patients, but many of them are unable to follow commands or maintain a particular posture. This device will not work with these patients. There should be a warning that you should not buy this product if you or your patient will be unable to hold a steady and precise arm position for the duration of the reading."
3,Omron Hem-650,I can only get this to work sometimes.I do have a problem with my hands and may not get this on tight enough. If you have a hearing problem your not going to hear the beeping sound. However I took it with me to the Doctor yesterday and it matched up pretty well to what there blood pressure monitor recorded. I happened to notice that the monitors the clinic used were also Omron.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this bp monitor after some online research; it was the highest rated wrist one, although there were some negative reviews. At first it seemed to be right on the money, but after about a week, I noticed I would get oddly low readings (as compared to all my other readings). I received an arm cuff monitor for christmas, and when I compare the two, taking one blood pressure about 5-10 minutes after the first, they are definitely different. The monitor is wonderfully easy to use... but if it doesn't take your bp correctly, it isn't any good. Therefore, I am disappointed."
4,OMNI BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR,"I PURCHASED THIS BECAUSE MY ORIGINAL ONE WAS REALLY OLD AND HAD STARTED GIVING ME PROBLEMS. I BOUGHT THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT SOUNDED GOOD. I LIKE IT ALRIGHT EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. IT DOES NOT HAVE THE GRAPH FEATURE. WITH MY OLD ONE I COULD HIT THE GRAPH BUTTON AND I COULD SEE ALL MY RESULTS AT ONCE. IT GAVE ME A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT MY NUMBERS WERE OVER A LONG TIME. THIS ONE HAS NO SUCH FEATURE. IN FACT, IT DOESN'T SHOW ME ANY NUMBERS AUTOMATICALLY AT ALL. IN ORDER TO SEE MY RESULTS, I HAVE TO HIT THE MEMORY EACH TIME AND GO BACK THAT WAY. I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT PART OF IT.I WOULD GIVE THIS 3-1/2 STARS"
4,Impressed...........,"This is my second Omron BP wrist monitor in 10 years. Overall it is very impressive. However, like so many high tech things they tend to pack so many extra features that to some degee it takes the simplicity out of using it. Like my first unit it is very accurate and easy to use, however it is very sensitive and must be held in exactly the right position over the heart. This is not much of a problem but takes getting used to. The design is very well thought out and the quality is very good. I would buy it again in preference over the other brands and models. Nothing wrong with the price either."
5,Excellent product and excellent price,"My husband and I are in our 70's and he has high blood pressure as well as an irregular heartbeat so this product is ideal for him. We have been using an arm pressure monitor that is also an Omron for about the last 5 years or so. We thought the wrist cuff would be easier to use plus the ability to detect the irregular heartbeat, so we decided to upgrade.This cuff is very, very easy to use and I use it too, even though I don't need blood pressure medicine now, I keep a record for my doctor when I have my yearly checkup. We would highly recommend this product."
1,Lousy zippers----I lost my dress shoes,This bag looked great but the zippers failed first time out....a complete mess trying to repair failed zippers at 1 a.m. the night before a flight (from a hotel). The main zipper failed so I had to stitch it shut. The other zippers failed in transit and my shoes were lost. Awful bag. I think I'll just have to throw it out.Too bad. The design and the material are good. But the zippers are terrible and I lost $150 pair of shoes. Do not trust the compartments.This is the worst item I've ever received via Amazon.
4,Roller Coaster Ride,"In my hood, for those of us who grew up in the hood, keeps the reader intrigued by captivating the feel of the ""block"" in New Jersey. The story is an exaggerated tale of the life of the hood. It was wonderful to finally see the story of ghetto life and what it can bring through the eyes of a woman. I read the book cover to cover in two days. If you live in the hood, or group up near it, you'll definitely enjoy the ride Endy was able to provide."
3,Beneficial. But fat burner?...hmm.,"Picked up a bottle of these at a local store. My primary goal was to see if this would contribute to my weight loss goal, which includes regular exercise/toning and good eating habits. I, however, have not seen any signifacant contribution from this product as far as fat burning effect, weight loss, inches lost, etc. I have recently found out that there are other green tea extract products with even higher percentages of catechins, polyphenols, EGCG, etc. Not sure if such products would be a better aid to weight loss as I haven't experimented with them. The higher the potetency and purity, the higher the cost.My daily dosage is one in the morning and one mid afternoon. I had no jitters with this product. I will continue to take these because there are many benefits to taking the extract. Perhaps, I'll begin taking a different product along with these capsules to help with weight loss/loss of inches. Raspberry Ketones maybe?"
2,Not for me,"I took this for about a week with my Raspberry Keytones and it seemed to make me hungrier and kept me up at night. When I stopped taking these with the RK's, my appetite was supressed. Not sure what the benefits were supposed to be but I didn't notice any changes. Maybe if I would have taken longer I would have noticed more but it really made me hungry so wasn't up for trying to prolong that."
3,No affect on weight,Does not seem to keep blood sugar down as yet - have not taken enough to tell differences.Will continue to use and hope the green tea works as mentioned - might still be good.
3,Follow Directions,"Just started taking these on 1/10/13, and will be updating in 3 months to tell you about this products effects, but wanted to give you guys some words of caution. This product should be taken with food, as stated on the label. I'm usually in a rush in the morning, and when I took this suppliment on a empty stomach, it caused some minor stomach cramping. Also, this product has up to 32mg of naturally occuring caffine, which is about a 1/3 of a cup of coffee. Will update on 4/10/13."
4,Green Tea Extract,No complaints because it seems to provide the expected health results at a reasonable level at a very reasonable price.
3,Good quality but very loose fitting,"This blouse, like most of the Jones New York products, is of very good quality but, I found the fit to be unfemininely loose. If I had seen the blouse in a store, I would not have bought it despite the reasonable price.I bought the blouse both in ivory and shell and the colors are just as beautiful as they appear in pictures here."
3,Nice edition. . . if you have good eyes,"Nice enough cover, nice Bible-ish paper, and a handy size, to be sure. The only problem is that the smaller, more convenient size results in text that that is also much smaller, and thus pretty hard to see. This is especially true if you're into the bifocal phase of your life. If you are familiar with the BCP, you are also no doubt aware the directions throughout any editon are a bit smaller in size (and italicized), so in this edition those bits are smaller yet, and thus really hard to deal with compared to the pew editions."
1,Cheaper locally,I can get a box (12) of identical Precisionaire filters locally for $1.49 each ( abox of 12 for $17.88).EWB
4,World War I at its finest,A good book that describes the Marine Corps actions in World War I. The book is very interesting as it comes from a marine's point of view. The book does sometimes leave something to be desired with its to the point writing style.
4,surprised,Just tested this little Randall R212CX with a Vox 50 watt Classic Plus head. I played with volume up to 3/4 no problem. Even at loud volume those hard to capture clean sounds come through without breakup. And hard rock riffs sound better than expected as well. My only gripe is that most tube amp heads are a little wider than the Randall R212CX.So this cabinet is about an inch narrower than I would have liked but the sound quality is very good.
2,A retread of old news,"Godwin's book is basically a rehash of previously published work. Pages 171-176, for example, were originally published in an Internet World column, though he acknowledges that nowhere. In fact, the entire book consists of such retread material spliced together, sometimes seamlessly, sometimes not. Many readers who haven't followed the free speech wars won't recognize this; they may simply wonder why the book is occasionally disjointed for no apparent reason. The other significant flaw in the book is that it stops with the CDA decision, in June 1997. For a book published in late 1998, it could have covered later material, especially since most of the book was cut-and-paste rather than new writing. It's a reasonable introduction to the censorship wars on the internet for readers which are completely unfamiliar with the history; but as for me, I'm pleased that I checked this book out from the library rather than purchasing it. -- Michael Sims"
4,Another Hannibal Jones Winner,"Good action adventure featuring Hannibal and the original cast of characters, plus. I enjoy his cool and calm in the worst of circumstances - especially when he's being beaten senseless. Light, fun and exciting. A quick ""two-day read."""
2,"Alright, but not your top of the line thriller","This had a storyline like a whirlpool in the ocean you hang around long enough you are going to get to the center and in this case the end. This was a book where every chapter was in itself a different story with no end and no meaning. The narrative and the characters were weak and none existent, it was so jumbled together that I found it difficult to stay focused on what exactly he was trying to create as a storyline. Bottom line this was so boring."
4,"You say ""Save Your Money"" I say ""Buy Spares""","Another reviewer said ""Do not buy this album... not if you value good music. And your hard-earned dollars."" But if you look at his review he also bought ""A Fever You Can't Sweat Out"" by Panic! At the Disco and ""If Only You were Lonely"" by Hawthorne Heights. So his comment isn't saying much for good taste in music.He also stated ""They sound like a bunch of whiney teenage feminists."" Lets refer back to his other cd purchases that day...Panic at the Disco and Hawthorne Heights. Lets not talk about whiney teenage angst.The sounds are a very good band and worth checking out."
2,Not a good album,I thought it was halfway decent the first time I heard it but the more I listened to it the more I hated it. They have been going downhill since Make Yourself and I can only hope they don't go any further down.
2,I don't throw up while I'm listening to it,"I was a long-time incubus fan, but now I am wondering if I've grown up and out of the phase or this album just blows. I am going to go with both...I have never heard so many cheesy metaphors or lame choruses. ""Love hurts, but sometimes it's a good hurt""??? really? I miss the days of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself... even Morning View. But I guess I've grown up and out of whatever kind of music they are spewing at us these days. This pains me to write, but i think i'm done with incubus for awhile, unless there's a complete reversal from this terrible album."
2,not that great for incubus,"i agree with Diana M. Weaver this cd really isnt that great. incubus other cds are a whole lot better. i really dont like how they have hearsts all over thier cd, nwhat the crap is that all about, their not emo. if you're going to buy an incubus cd get a different one."
2,Worst Incubus CD yet,"As a longtime fan of Incubus, I thought Crow Left of the Murder was a great move for them. That was the direction I thought they needed to move and really showed them growing up. Light Grenades is HEAVY on LIGHT and LIGHT on GRENADES. It really has no soul and nothing to grab onto. It's just an empty disc with a track or two that are worth listening to. I haven't listened to the disc since it first came out. I was hoping Brandon and the boys would channel a little more angst about the state of the world and put aside the teenage emotions. Perhaps that's as far as they are capable of going. Let's get back to more Megolmaniac style writing and passion. Light Grenades is a major DUD."
2,What has happened to this band?,"This, besides the ""hit"" (Anna Molly), is not a good album at all. Incubus, at one time, were probably the best band in the world. When I compare albums like ""Make Yourself"" and ""Morning View"" to their latest 2 albums, it's like it's not even the same band. The songwriting has gotten weak, the music sounds rather noisy and boring (besides, why isn't Mike Einziger playing a PRS anymore? Fender Jaguar's or whatever they are have a really crappy sound).""A Crow Left Of The Murder"" was a major let-down for me, who was a huge fan of Incubus until that album came out. I should've known that this album would've been equally as bad if not worse, but, instead I wasted 14 dollars.Incubus needs to stop trying so hard to sound ""different"" and stick to their older sound. That's what the fans really liked and that's what SOLD!"
2,EVEN 2 STARS IS A STRECH,"What is this Sh**? Incubus seems to be getting worse with each album. Atleast A Crow Left Of The Murder had 1 or 2 hits on the album (although it sounded too much like a RUSH album). Light Grenades offers no hits at all! Incubus kind of reminds me of another band I used to like, STAIND (AKA SELLOUT), because the first few albums were excellent and then I just have no idea what happened. With Incubus, I have no idea what they are trying to do with this album. Parts of songs are good but I'm having trouble getting through the whole album. How can people say they've gotten better? Listen to ""Make Yourself"" or ""Morning View"" and then ""Light Grenandes"" and tell me which of the 3 sound like CRAP! I've been to a few Incubus concerts in the past but now I can truly say I have no desire in hearing new music from this band ever again. R.I.P. Incubus, we had some good times together but like with most bands you just had to leave me."
4,Enjoyable,"This book is enjoyable, and reminds me of the work of James Patterson and another lawyer-author named David Hosp. Like those writers, Dugoni writes at a fast-pace, using very short chapters to tell his story. This is good old-fashioned escapist fiction, a nice beach read.The Jury Master is NOT a legal thriller, however. It is a political thriller that just happens to have a lawyer as the main character. So if you're looking for a Grisham/Turow type thriller, with a lot of scenes in the courtroom, this book probably isn't for you. I would suggest John Lescroart instead."
1,DO NOT BUY! TERRIBLE!,"TERRIBLE! Jury Master is the most trite, overwrought piece of self-indulgent garbage I have ever had the misfortune to purchase. With more deus ex machinas than a Pink Floyd concert and more excuses (they call them ""plot twists"") than a Clinton deposition, this story is an insult to all but the most mentally challenged. The author must have been a joke of a lawyer to come up with this poor showing. Look for a miniseries starring Tori Spelling, Marvin Hagler, and Jan Michael Vincent. Now we can say that John Grisham isn't the worst legal thriller writer alive. Thanks for that, Robert Dugoni."
1,good beginning silly ending,The author has talent - he can describe events and scenes. He cannot link the plot together logically.The plot zooms out of control and becomes silly and irrelevant.Any more comments are not worth the effort. The book was a big disappointment.If curious - wait awhile and buy it used under $1.
2,"Great Potential, Bad Scenes and Editing","Another Asylum movie. Some are good, and some are not so good. This move is somewhere in the middle, with a pretty fast-paced (meaningless?) plot and average acting. The fight scenes ranged from slow and clumsy to rather well-choreographed. The limited pieces of orchestral music are effective, but not played nearly long enough; perhaps more of the budget should have gone to the musical score and performance.Some of the most important scenes in the movie are boring and poorly-filmed. Marc Singer's final battle-scene should have been serious and important, but it felt like just another death. The climactic battle . . . kinda stunk.Needless nudity and a drug reference in the first few minutes of the movie was both funny and unnecessary. Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are archetypal movies, and this movie combines the two. This movie could have been epic, but it was only run-of-the-mill. Two stars."
4,The first book my son learned to read - at 2 1/2!,"This is not great literature, but it is simple, repetetive, and has lovely pictures. My 2.5 year-old son reads it to me before bed every night. It is also very soothing and really gets him in the mood to lie down with his teddy and sleep, just like the child in the book."
1,It's not the complete book!,"I bought this for a young lady who has a brand-new baby. It's a book that has really thick cardboard pages, and the manufacturing process requires pages in multiples of 8 or something, so THEY LEFT OFF THE LAST FIVE OR SIX PAGES! Yeow! If I was the author, I'd be SO angry about it!My babies LOVED this book - it used to end with a perfect ""time to go to sleep"" message. Now it ends abruptly. What moron came up with the idea for this book?"
3,Good basic text for forensic psychology,"This is a good text to get the idea behind risk and need assessment in forensic psychology. Although a bit dry, it is what is being used within the field today, so is very relevant."
3,not bad,"Nice set for the price, but the finish is coming off the forks after just one use! Still usable, but if you are looking for something to last longer than one use, invest in a better quality product."
2,The claw crackers coating came off,After washing what I thought were stainless steel claw crackers. The shiny metal coating came off and there was a dark metallic substance underneath that left stains on your hands when you touched it. The forks are okay but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
2,Not great for eye care,"This product does create moist heat (I wasn't sure that the whole ""pulls moisture from the air"" thing would pan out). It doesn't, however, stay hot for very long. It's pretty cool by the end of my five minute treatment.Also, it's probably better for sinus issues than eye problems. The beads inside don't stay very well in the middle parts that sit on your eyes. Instead, they pool to the side."
5,Great relief!,This was a gift for my husband who suffers from sinus headaches. It really has helped and he is very happy with it.
1,Dispointed,This headache wrap was very disapointing. It can spend several days in the freezer but only holds the cold for about 15 minites once you pull it out to use.
3,Not quite what I needed,"I ordered the mask to use for my eyelids, not my sinuses. I have granulated eyelids and need to soften the oils at the base of my eyelashes each night. The mask did not retain heat long enough to accomplish the task. I also would not use the mask for sinus pain for the same reason. It is comfortable the use."
4,Simple but Great,"This book is mostly a case by case exampling of the affects of Reiki by a doctor who is a Reiki master. The author does not give any empirical evidence that Reiki works. Niether does she presume that such evidence exists. What the author does give is her many personal experiences with her efforts to provide the best health care that she possibly can for her patients in an Emergency Room enviroment. While the writing is somewhat plain and there are excerpts from the text and other additions in the margins, the book is a good and fast read. I found myself eating up the stories. She provides good basic information for anyone who is interested in learning about Reiki. And lots of information on what to expect from Reiki and possible effects and outcomes. I enjoyed the book alot. I would recommend others who have an interest in Reiki to read it. I am glad to have read it and I am just as glad that Dr. Eos wrote it."
3,Brooklyn Tab. Choir,"Very coordinated and professional choir. Very classy and well edited. Songs are a blessing. They are a little stiff and traditional for my type, but its still a good DVD to have."
5,Enzo would be proud of this book.,"If you can afford only one Ferrari book this year,buy this one! This book is a tribute not ony to Enzo,but to all that were involved. By all means read this book from cover to cover,it deserves that attention. You will learn things,or relearn things,that you did not know,or had forgotten. I know I did and it was a wonderful lesson. This book was a gift from my family,but trust me,I WOULD HAVE GLADLY BOUGHT IT FOR MY COLLECTION. Having been an avid Ferrari enthusiast since 1953,all I can say to the publisher and author is thank you and well done."
5,Quintessential guide to the rich 50 yr history of Ferrari,"From the uncountable interesting anecdotes, to the wonderful photos and drawings, this book brings the history of Ferrari to life. The reminicings of past Ferrari competition drivers, and the ever entwined influence of Enzo Ferrari and his machinations make the reader appreciate how the man and his cars have become synonimous with speed, beautiful design and competition glory. If you buy only one book about Ferrari, make it this one."
4,It's About Time for this Video!,"Buck is entrusted with a box,but he does not know who-or where=to take it.The box holds time,and it enables several crew members of the Searcher to see into the future or past.The ending will touch your heart.It is interestin to get background info on sone characters,especially Hawk.I love seeing Wilma Deering looking more feminine than she does in any other episode.If You're a Buck Rogers fan,this video is worth YOUR time!e"
1,"Boo Waa, My A**","Suppose Universal decided NOT to pay the music royalties for ""American Graffiti"" and replaced all of the classic oldies with elevator music? What kind of crap would you have then????? That's what Season 2 of Quantum Leap was - CRAP. They didn't replace elevator music with other elevator music; they replaced classic oldies, IMPORTANT TO THE TONE AND TIME OF THE STORY (at least to the CREATOR of the show, and to the fans) and slapped on throwaway MUZAK. Universal ripped me off on Season 2 - AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN!"
1,"If the Music doesn't matter to YOU, good for you....","But I tell you what, it mattered to the director, to the viewers and to say that music doesn't matter is simply nonsensical. I check ed out this 3rd set and I am not buying it. Universal con'ed us with Season 2 and make no mistake, the music is essential. How does it differ to change the music (which in this series was a character as much as the actors) to edit our actors, change the ending or what have you? To add to the insult, what Universal is adding is truly elevator music, done on a synth in 2 minutes. I love this show, I love the idea, but I for one can't watch this butchered show. If you can, and you truly think, music that was intended to be in there as a plot point, doesn't matter, good for you. Don't tell John Williams. Or James Horner. Or Mike Post........"
3,Music Replaced Again?,"Will the music be replaced ONCE AGAIN?!! I have a feeling the answer will be YES!.There were several eposides in addition to MIA,where the replacment of muisc soured the mood and balance of the eposides.Animal Frat,Disco Inferno,Maybe Baby,just to name a few.The show is EXCELLENT 5 STARS,the replacement of the muisc makes it 3 Stars.The BEST way to enjoy a show you like to TO TAPE IT WHEN IT ORIGINALLY AIRS! I did this with QL back in March of 1989 and have every eposide up to the Series Finale ALL WITH the ORIGINAL MUISC OPENING THEMES and COMMERICALS"
4,Funny,"I got this for $2 in Christmas Tree Gift shop, yes, for two bucks only.I found it very funny, though kids don't actually look forward to eating anything that comes out of it's rear, even though it's candies.It has a very small storage amd candy simply pours out when you move the tail."
3,Poor communication,"I Emailed the company twice and never got an answer. I had ordered the wrong style and sent an Email within minutes hoping to correct the mistake. I sent another message later on to see if they had recieved the first message and changed the style, but again got no answer. Although I recieved what I ordered, it wasn't what I wanted. Their return policy states they only accept returns if the product is defective or if they made a mistake, so now I am stuck with the item."
2,"It's not Millstone, but it's OK","I bought this when Safeway was OUT of Millstone Swiss Chocolate Almond coffee. It's OK, but it's not Millstone. The Seller was great and product received on time, but the quality and taste are just ok."
2,You Can Do Better,"When you compare this book to the 2-sided PLANISPHERE,the book is almost useless.Go with a planisphere and or a software such as ""Galileo Planetarium"",(Complete Guide TO The Cosmos Ver.1.8).A planisphere will track by the month and the hour.A software will include the planets.New comers should be careful to order a planisphere within the latitude of their location.I myself would not have bought this book if I had fliped through it in a book store.I expected more.The knowledge is better than nothing,but you can do much better."
2,And the point of this book is...?,"I read this book in a bookstore in about one minute. It's all of 2 inches high by 1 inch wide and has no more than 20 pages. ""A Aga"" is the story of a guy who goes hunting, or something like that; I honestly couldn't tell. Every page has an incomprehensible scribble, followed by a description of what it represents. All are along the lines of ""Hunting deer"" or ""They killed a bad man."" Get the idea? Please avoid this book, unless you really love children and drawings by them."
5,The Decembrists rock!,"I'm 57 years old. I've must've heard Stairway to Heaven 10,000 times. The Decembrists offer musicianship, lyrics and melodies that are, in a word, refreshing. Picaresque is a fine example of that."
5,Great Find,"Strange lyrics, but I like them. My first Decemberists album. I bought it because of the recommendation, and I am glad I did. This band really rocks and is so much fun. It has kind of a dark sense of humor running through it. This record has a kind of folkish chamber pop with seemingly highly intelligent lyrical content. The Decemberists are unlike any other group out there. You can't really compare them to anyone, where they go is who knows, but it's a good place. Finding bands like The Decemberists are one of the reasons I like Amazon. I would never have found the Decemberists if I hadn't seen them listed as a favorite of others who liked much of the same music I do - and I would have missed out on a truly great album."
4,Pretty Good,"I expected something more introspective, alittle more poetic, a little more Harvard, a little more Princeton. Some nice ballads like Eli the Barrow Boy and Of Angels and Angles. The Infanta is interesting. I really like On the Bus Mall and 16 Military Wives is sort of in the style of Morrisey, not bad. Would like to hear some of their earlier introspective works. This CD is alittle rough and messy, but not terrible."
2,"""Picaresque"" It Certainly Is; Picturesque too, But Good is Another Matter","What's most annoying about this CD? I can hardly decide. Maybe that it's a bunch of Portland people pretending they're Steeleye Span or Fairport Convention? Or the fact that rock opera has been going straight downhill from Tommy and this one (though to be fair it doesn't bill itself so grandly) does nothing to stop the slide? Or that the lead singer and writer's voice grates on me like fingernails across a blackboard? Whatever, while the raves for it are very plentiful here, I have to dissent and say these folks are melodramatic and decidedly mediocre. I had to immediately put Surrealistic Pillow on the CD player to get rid of the bad aural taste."
3,Picaresque by The Decemberists paints stories,"If there was ever such a thing as 'theatrical folk pop', Picaresque would certainly fall into that category. There are the comparisons to Neutral Milk Hotel, but I would also place The Decemberists somewhere in between that and psych-folk artists like Mull Historical Society and Badly Drawn Boy. The main storyteller/vocalist/songwriter is Colin Melloy, a balladeer who weaves his tales amidst a backdrop of strings, acoustic guitars, and organs. Melloy's nasal-type vocals straddle Lee Mavers and Colin McIntyre, but that's almost secondary to the story he wants to tell, the picture he wants to paint. 'Picaresque' is catchy, safe, middle of the road pop/rock, and although it doesn't exactly push the envelope of music experimentation, music is also about telling stories, which is what 'Picaresque' and The Decemberists are, inheriting the tradition of story tellers, a folk-rock escapade guaranteed to brighten up your day."
2,GREAT STORY..TERRIBLE PRESENTATION,"The saga is well told, highly descriptive narative of a most unusual set of real life circumstances. (5 stars for this portion of purchase) The problem came about one-third through the text when the book spine split more than half way down the binding. This condition worsened as I read on, with total separation before I finished. Given it is a paperback, its life should be longer than the first reading.(1 star for this portion)."
5,Great workout for beginners +!,"I've been using Kathy Smith workout videos since the 1980's and she really is the best! It's been awhile since I've worked out and I've gained a substantial amount of weight plus have some back problems. I needed a video that wouldn't be too difficult for me and motivating enough to help me get back on track to getting fit. This video is just that! The ""marching"" is a great way to get your cardio and have fun doing it! Don't get me wrong though, it may not be too difficult but it had me drenched in sweat when I was done! Excellent workout! :)"
4,"Good product, good price.",Love these mats! I use them for leopard geckos and they are great! Easy to spot clean and they are machine washable! Will be buying more in the future!
2,Didn't last,"I have had a rarely used roomba 400 series for 4 years. It has not worked for the last year and I sent it in for diagnostic. Was told it needed over $200 in repairs. I've replaced the batteries 2 times and just can't spend any more money on a poorly engineered product. It was worked well when it worked but I certainly did not get much use out of it. As the roomba says, ""Uh Oh""."
2,Lack of service,"I had a roomba and loved it. It got old and needed to be replaced. I got the new one and it quit working within 2 months. Upon contacting Irobot I sent it back in order to get a replacement. Replacement had no battery (I guess I was supposed to keep the old one). Upon contacting the company again, I was told,""We apologize for the inconvenience. However any parts or accessories sent to us are not retrievable, you will have to purchase a new battery.""Yeah, thanks. I'd rather buy a robot from another company. You have my battery and I now have a robot that can't do anything because it has no power."
5,4220 discovery floor vac,"I found the iRobot Discovery 4220 purchased via Amazon,remanufactured to be a great little tool that runs on my carpeted floor then hardwood borders without effort.Great automated vac to keep dust from building up in a room used primarily as a home-office.Frederick Jamnetski SINY"
5,"Profound meditation on parent-child, human-animal bonds","A graceful and poignant meditation on mother love, mother work, the parent-child relationship, and the human-animal relationship. With great sensitivity and insight and no self pity, Wells reveals her own experiences first as a married and then single mother of a daughter, and as the surrogate mother of puppies who survive the death of their mother minutes after the puppies' birth. This book will move readers interested in the bonds between parents and children or humans and animals and the complexes of emotions and attitudes associated with these bonds."
4,Good book,"This book was written for the advanced ebay user. The author decided to initially focus on a junior in high school before doing some case studies of larger businesses at the end. I feel the chapter reviews were unnecessary and more hypotheticals would have been nice, but overall an interesting book."
1,OLD,"All Old strategies that Will lose you money on eBay today. Pushes you to use a service like ""marketworks"" which is OK for big sellers, but garbage for the rest of us. The Only thing that matters on ebay is price. forget everything else, get it as cheep as you can, and sell it for less then anyone else. Keep your money for the listing fees. Don't bother with this old book."
5,Dorcy 6 watt LED,Extremely bright LED flashlight. Well defined central beam. I work as an Aircraft Inspector and this has become my primary light. AAA batteries rather than expensive lithiums make it cost effective to operate.
4,VERY BRIGHT flashlight,This a great little light for the money. It is a little cheesy with the battery holder that takes AAA batteries. You can't expect too much for what you pay for such a bright light. The Lumin output is better that anything I could find in this price range.
5,Good Stuff,"WoWee - this is one bright LED light. Simply cannot look into the beam path-temporary blindness. Solid construction, uses cheap AAA batteries. Battery life over 2 hours so far - Love it"
4,Nice 3AAA light. Dorsy CR123 model 41-4295 much better.,"I have this light & the Dorsy 2-CR123 model 41-4295. The brightness is close but the CR123 model is noticeably brighter and better built. This 3AAA model has an adjustable reflector housing & it's too loose. If over tightened it will damage the base of the reflector as it has no stop & goes against the LED assembly. My runtime test went as follows: First hour - very bright, second hour - about brightness and 3rd hour barely usable for spot. Red low power indicator came on about 1 hour. I now carry this as my main grab light in my truck because of the 3AAA batteries."
5,AWESOME LIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'VE BEEN IN SPECIALIZED POLICE/SECURITY FOR 20YRS. THIS IS A GREAT LIGHT!I MADE IT EVEN BETTER BY USING DURACELL RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES.BRIGHT,COMPACT,DURABLE AND A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!!"
3,"If you have more money, buy the Pro","I had a Digi 001 and downgraded to mbox2. It sounds worse than 001, it is much more unstable too. I didn't have money to buy a 002 at the time but I should the mbox pro when I have enough money. The firewire woks much better than the usb 1.0.Well, Igave 3 stars cause it still beeing a Protools system."
5,Leading to War,This documentary does an excellent job of showing just how the Bush Administration manipulated Americans into supporting the invasion of Iraq. It's a must watch for us now with Bush's interest in taking on Iran. Let's not be deceived again.
4,Maybe the best golf movie noone has seen......,Enjoyable performance by Quaid & is semi-believeable in it's golf action & speak. Kathryn Harrold(?) does a good job as Quaids wife-to-leave. This is NOT a kids movie by any means............& I 2nd all the calls for a DVD version. This movie is worthy of it. Funny as hell in parts with Jack Warden.
3,Global Mix,"1,000 pictures into 128 pages makes for quite a spectacle, especially when European, American and Australian trucking is encompassed.History buffs may appreciate the chapters dedicated to early makes from both the USA and Europe, from a pictorial perspective at least. The collage of early truck brochure covers is a a nice touch.Tow trucks, off-highway trucks and Australian road trains are not left out either, and there are the show truck and race truck chapters to add spice.As befits many light weight pictorial books, factual errors abound. I suggest that you take all text with a big chunk of salt.A pure reference book this is not, but the 1,000 colorful photos should hold an enthusiast's interest. As an alternative amusement one or more players can play ""spot the mistake"" or ""what is wrong with this picture?""A large colorful glossy hardback with interesting and varied pictures, including a number of cab interior shots."
4,Fun for Packers fans,"This is what it says, it is Monopoly, but Packer style. If you have 3 hrs to play a game, this is it. If you drive to own Brett Favre or Donald Driver, play this! It is older, so the players are way out of date, but it is fun to play, and Brett is where Boardwalk use to be. Houses are locker rooms, hotels are Stadiums. Everything is the same in playing regular Monopoly, but changed to represent the sports team and the game, however you can still go to jail. Its as fun as the original, however hate that it takes hours to play! Who wouldn't want to say they bought Favre? Its what we try for each game!"
4,What Becomes Of The Record Label Owner's Sweetheart?,"An argument can be made that this is actually Diana's debut solo album as none of the actual Supremes (Mary, Cindy) sang on any of the tracks. As such, the album cater's to Diana's singing style - light and commercial. Soul and R&B; is sacrificed for pop appeal. Individually, these tracks are catchy and endearing. Collectively, they're an assault on the ears. The production follows the lack of depth the singer's voice embodies.As far as listening to these songs randomized among the Supremes cannon as a whole, they're very catchy and great to listen to. Put together in one album from start to finish, they're a disappointment."
2,Darker than it looks in picture,"I was disappointed when I received this brown sanding sugar. I wanted it to look like sand for decorating cupcakes in a beach theme. I passed by a lot of dark brown sanding sugar on Amazon, and chose this one since it was lighter in the picture. Unfortunately when it arrived, it was really dark brown."
1,I was so surprised that it was in French!,"I was recommended this book by the website, probably based on past high ratings of Mr. Sedaris' books. These ratings include Me Talk Pretty One Day- The book's description should say somewhere that the book is not in English......and that it is the French version of Me Talk Pretty One Day. I am very disappointed - I was looking forward to a evening of new material from one of my favorite authors."
1,Me Buy Deux Copies Of French Version of Book Me Deja Have!,"I thought this was a new book about Sedaris's further hilarious struggles with the French language, so I bought one copy for myself and another for my dad. Guess what? It's the French translation of ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"". I hope I can return them."
5,"Filmed by a Christian, for Christians","In ""India Face To Face"", filmmaker Jon Wood takes you to various towns and villages in India. Not to fancy resorts or the high-cast people, but to the sidewalks and slums where thousands of Indian's live every day.Each of the nine shows has a different theme, but all emphasize the fact that more people live below the poverty line ($1.08 a day) then we would like to realize, and also how desperately they need to be introduced to their Creator, and freed from the bondage of useless rituals and penances.While this DVD may not appeal to non-christians, or to those looking strictly for Indian culture, it did appeal to me, because as a christian, I find it inspiring and refreshing to see people spreading the good news of salvation in foreign lands.It is, in my opinion, very educational and eye-opening, and it really challenges you to take a closer look at how most of the world lives, and what you are doing to help them.Check it out, it's worth it."
5,"jackie robinson, an intimate portrait",I have wanted this book since I first saw it advertised on the back of aWheaties box. It is an incredible book.
2,very disappointing,"I was looking for a book that provides an alternative, ""esoteric"" point of view on the solar system. Unfortunately i was completely misled by the table of contents which looked very appealing. In fact the actual contents of each chapter are very small, and sometimes have nothing to do with the title of the chapter! Page after page the author keeps looking for coincidences in ratios between sizes, periods and orbits of the planets. But after 5 pages it becomes very repetitive and boring.My final impression is that the author has not found an efficient approach to the object he is trying to study. Astrology is probably the efficient approach to better understand our solar system."
2,If you need 4 buy 6,One of my four numbers doesn't work at all. Two of the other numbers work most of the time but not always. One of the numbers works great.
3,Dust Mop,"On-line at Webkinz this pet is adorable, but the actual Yorkie looks mangie...like a dust mop. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE. Its thin chopped up hair is cut at different lengths all over and is fugly. On top of that, it is very cheaply made unlike the other quality made webkinz pets that are cute and constructed well. Hide the Yorkie in a drawer and play the virtual Yorkie on Webkinz since it is so cute. I love the Webkinz site, it is great for kids and educational along with fun."
1,Horrible packaging,My Webkinz came in an envelope. It was all matted up and looked terrible!!! I'll never purchase another Webkinz from here again. It DEFINATLEY doesn't look as pictured.
1,Keep looking.,"This Webkinz is a disappointment. The ""fur"" sheds and is matted. It appears not to be made as well as others we have purchased. Size is very small compared to other Webkinz."
2,Poor quality loppers,I ordered these loppers for my son to use while I use the one I bought 15 years ago. This lopper has very thin metal at the cutters. It is three times thiner than mine. On small branches the blade bends and does not fully cut the branch sometimes. This lopper will not last long with heavy use.
4,laugh out loud funny,"This book reminded me of Dave Barry, and was laugh out loud funny on several points. Of course my favorite character was Serge. Nick said this was his best book but I'll read the others anyway."
4,Do the Twist!,"This book is pretty funny anyway, but since I grew up in Florida (and hated the place) it gets extra marks for so sarcastically skewering the Sunshine State.The book follows several interconnected subplots that all tie together quite nicely at the end. Along the way, we get peeks at the shady world of used car salesmen, corporate consultants, and real estate agents -- all of which get the skewering they deserve.This book has lots of drugs and sex, so the ""right"" mindset is required to enjoy this, ideally one with a sarcastic sense of humor. This is very much a dark comedy, so you have to like this sort of thing.This was my first excursion into Dorsey's warped world, and I'll certainly return for more."
4,"Great Comedy, poor format","Great Comely series. Poor disc format. Plays on some devices and not on others (cost of unit is not a factor, just the presence of the mystery Canadian codec). TV quality resolution. Arrived on time and in good condition."
5,Good mini series/tv movie,I loved the show/movie when it came out years ago so I was excited when all 3 were put on one disc. All the actors were great even for a low budget made for tv thing.
4,Fallen,"If you have read the Fallen books, this version of the movie was a little different. The movie was broken up into 4 different episodes, which leads me to believe it was a series on TV. I expected watching a 2 hour movie, but was pleasantly surprised by what I watched. My Daughter and I enjoyed watching this movie as much as we enjoyed reading the books. I would recommend purchasing this version."
2,Disappointed.......,"but not in the Movie. It's awesome that is why when i watched it on TV, i looked forward to the day they finally bring it out on DVD. But i gave it a 2 star rating because IT HAS NO CAPTIONING OR SUBTITLES. what? We hard of hearing folks don't like to watch movies. why would anyone, in 2010, release a DVD without either of those. it was a good thing i rented it and didn't buy it. i would have wasted my money. After waiting so long, they come out with this. I am pissed. Maybe, more of us become pissed, they will release again, this time properly done. No Fallen for me."
3,removable filter,Not what I excpected nor is it as big as the one that was in there but it will do I guess
4,Very solid racket for the price,"This racket is a great all-around racket. It's very durable and the ball comes off very consistently, regardless of where on the racket you hit it. It's got enough power for solid drives and smashes, enough spin for decent chops, and it's a decent defender.I've played a large number of Butterfly rackets (Seemiller, Chiu, Kenji) and this is still one of my favorites. It's VERY similar to the Seemiller (another favorite, obviously) but it's got a bit more power and in my head, it seems like it's got a touch more spin. If you play more of a defensive game, go with the Seemiller. If you're strictly offense, get the much higher-powered and higher-spin Carlos Chiu. I love this one for its all-around, slightly offensive prowess.And heck, even though mine's over two years old, I can still be competitive with it when I break my newer, more expensive rackets."
4,Good Paddle,"This paddle plays nice. For me, it added a noticeable amount of spin to my shots. The price I got it for was great. This is good for anyone who is beginning to take their game more seriously"
5,Awesome and easy to follow!!!,"For me this book is the best on the market. I have been doing adult portraits and landscapes for a reason; they are much easier to take than children. However this book by Jim Miotke, a professional photographer and photography teacher at [...] has given me the insight and confidence to begin taking portraits of children. In fact I have already started with my grandchildren. The BetterPhoto Guide to Photographing Children is full of excellent advice on working with children. I have no regrets in purchasing this book! If you want to take pictures of children and want to learn with an easy to follow teacher, than this is the photography book for you! Awesome book one I will keep in my library for other family members to use...... Ritajane"
1,Not Good.. Definitely not tuff enough,My 1 year old Lab ripped this ball in less than 1 hour. It's in pieces now. Waste of my time and money.
1,Spyro Art Pen not worth unpacking,"Seemed like it would be fun, probably would be if it wasn't a piece of trash. Comes with several refill inks. That's good since it runs out of ink after 2-3 drawings. My 8 year old would need the skills of Picasso to make this do anything. The old Spyro Graph had a perimeter piece to give it shape, this is just a pen out of control. Don't waste you money!Spyro Gyro Motorized Art Pen"
4,Super fun!,"Fun pen for a 7 year old. I gave it 4 stars because it's a little awkward, but that is just a symptom of the type of product not the design. Once it's used a few times, the child gets used to it and it's a fun addition to the many writing utensils this age child likes to use."
3,Mighty Beans,The Mighty Beans are very fun because you can do tricks you can play games and collecthem.And there are a lot of accsesories.
3,"Works ok, but...","As mentioned, your reception will be dependent on the antenna you use. A few notes:1) you'll need an adapter to connect a standard antenna to this unit2) there are NO weather stations, despite what other reviews say (verified with midland)3) there is no ""channel scan"" function. so you'll have to tune into a channel and hope that you're on the right one. you can't monitor both 9 and 19, for example."
1,Arthur E. Jones,I don't like it because I can't get it to work.For some reason I can't it to do anything. I must have made a bad buy.Thanks for checking with me
3,Radio vs. Headset,"Before I used the radio I purchased a headset to go along with the radio. Even though all spects say the two are compatable, they are not working together. The seller of the headset say they will credit my account, that won't fix the problem. I need to know which one is defective, radio or headset..."
4,Great for the money,"For the price, it's a great handheld. Will transmit about 2/5 - 1/2 mile. Receives about a mile away or just a little less (of course, this depends on the sender's rig). Other people who say it cannot go 10 feet must not be operating it right. All measurements were outdoors with a in-car mobile unit with somewhat flat terrain, and plenty of houses and trees. When used in a house or a car, the distance is impacted a bit. I imagine a windshield mount or magnetic antenna would help drastically."
5,REPLACING THE SAME,"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE THE SAME EXACT MODEL THAT I HAD FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS.THE BATTERIES CORRODED AND ACID DAMAGED IT.OTHERWISE IT WOULD STILL BE WORKING,GOOD SOLID UNIT,SO I BOUGHT THE SAME AGAINNOW I TAKE THE BATTERIES OUT WHEN NOT IN USE !!"
1,pure crap,"Bought this Hand held, only worked for 300.feet. I am only glad I did not get stuck in a emergency and needed it. This was CRAP."
4,NPFH-70,Battery is shipped in just 3 days in good packing box..no damage nothing.I got it just a day before i was about to leave for Las Vegas... battery works fine and helped me a lot for shooting videos...since the standard supplied NPFH-60 battery with my camcoder HDR-SR11 gives only 60min of backup. However this batter (NPFH-70) gives almost 150min backup on my camcoder.Thanks amazon for making it in just in time.
5,Great Battery!!!,This is one great battery. My wife and I recently went on a 9 day cruise and took this battery along to be used as my main battery for our camcorder while using my old battery as a backup. I never used my backup battery and I charged this battery only once throughout our whole trip! What a great buy. You can't go wrong with this one.
1,Cancelled!,I ordered this product from via Amazon but through Cameta Camera for $39.99. Two days later Cameta Camera cancels the order for no reason. I look now and the price for the same battery is now $15+ higher. Amzan through its agent Cameta is not honoring the purchase.
2,"product fine, software stinks","i'm too exasperated to make this into a decent review. i have no clue why Sony feels the need to have proprietary issues over its downloading software. this makes this machine EXTREMELY frustrating for those that work on different computers or need to transfer video to other sources. i wish someone or SONY would just let me know, WHAT'S THE POINT? WHAT DO YOU GAIN? i feel like throwing this camcorder against the wall."
5,Excellent Customer Service,I just got this battery today and I couldn't be happier. I received it barely six days after placing the order. I shall definitely buy again from this seller and would recommend him to a friend.
1,defective,"I ordered the NPFH70 H series battery for my sony DCRHC90. This is the second battery I ordered. The first, ordered in March 2010 from a different seller worked great. The battery ordered July 2010 from Agent Frugal came without a invoice and does not work at all. The camera screen says to use a proper battery. I'll be requesting refund and purchasing locally even though the cost will be greater."
1,Less than half of battery life than you expected.,"Battery advertised as good up to 6.5 hours, I supposed it is being used with LCD off, with using Sony Handycam HDR-HC5, it gives me less than 3 hours (172 minutes). Received an replacement from Amazon, it is no different than the first one. false advertisement!"
2,item falls short,"The sony battery falls short of the promised storage capacity (6-hours).This battery is alleged to have a storage time of 6-hours but it barely lasts for 3-hours. I do not mind paying this price for a battery as long as it performs as promised. Looks like another Dud product from over seas.I used to believe that you get what you pay for, but not in this case."
3,Good book but,"The first and last time that I read this book before I was in the 8th grade. It was great then but I see things now that I must not have seen then. A lot of the in-depth details about Dr. Orient's routines seem labored and contrived.An editor would have been nice, too. There are many times that the wrong word was used but it was spelled correctly and started with the same letter."
1,"Horrible, broke first day I used it.",I would never buy one of these again. It seemed sturdy til it fell from about 3 1/2 feet & popped. It was the FIRST time I used it. Not good.
4,Ive used mine for years...,"Never had an issue, gets nice and hot if left in the sun. And, its only $7.00 at Walmart. I have two and never had a single issue. Hang mine from a tree... love it."
1,Coleman 5gal camp shower,"Item is total junk. The bag was less than full and used only as spare warm water. It was never used in the shower or hung as designed and simply tore the handle off clear across like a bag of chips on first use while carrying it in my hand. Bag came as a freebie with another item, I would have been angry if I had paid for it. I did however purchase the Advanced Elements 2.5 gal bags and am thrilled with them."
5,..t..,I think these things work great!! i been using them for long time and they've always worked pretty decent. Best thing to do if you want it to last is to only fill 1/2 or 3/4 ways full. Usually i use it for cleaning dishes but when i want at decently warm shower ill warm the water over the fire and use a funnel to pour it in.
5,Ready for a hot shower,"We have two of these and use them often. I fill it up, lay it on the picnic table and when we get back from a day of hiking and getting dirty we all have nice hot showers waiting.the only problem is that the hose gets a kink in it and the valve is a bit cheesy, but to have a nice hot shower in the middle of nowhere is worth fighting the valve"
3,"Not always user friendly, but it worked well enough","We purchased two of these after we had a massive tornado hit town last year. We didn't have power for over a week. It was late April and not quite warm enough to really warm the water without the help of the sun. We have a lot of shade around here but we managed to move the packs to keep them in the sun. The directions were not easy to understand and we had a really hard time figuring out how the nozzle worked. They still leaked some when we put them in the sun, but no rips in the seams and it really did make life a little better while we were without hot water.HOWEVER, the SMELL of the item infuses the water. You get that plastic/PVC smell and therefore, it will transfer onto the skin. But it is better than smelling like BO.I would recommend this for situations like what we were in, but I don't know if I would trust it on the campground. Like I said, it leaked out of the nozzle and wasted water."
2,Didn't last for mutilple use,Worked great the the first time I used it; but the seam around the inlet plug pulled loose when I tried to refill. Plus 5 gal is very heavy. I replaced with a 3.5 gal from a different vendor and like it better.
2,Poor quality,Used this bag on 3 camping trips of 3 days in length...so that is 9 days of use and the bag is no longer usable as it leaks! Poor quality!
5,Good,"It's very functional. No regrets. Easy to use, easy to handle, I'm satisfied with this item that i bought thanks"
1,junk,"I only bought one, but it split open at a seam after a couple of uses. I tried to glue and tape it back together, which held for a while but even so, the flow was pretty flimsy.Best to go with another brand."
4,Does the job,"This shower heats up 5 gallons of water in no time, the problem for me was finding a place high enough and strong enough to hang the 40lbs. The water pressure is slow, but it does the job."
1,Coleman 5 gallon PVC Camp Shower,This did NOT work. We bought two - the first one split at at a seam the first time we tried to use it - and they never got very hot even sitting in the direct sun. Not worth the money - don't know how to return them. Out the money
4,A pretty good read,"Like everything of Gemmell's that I've read, this book spins a good, imaginative, occassionally gritty yarn, but is rarely compelling and absorbing. The two things that annoy me the most are that (1)his characters, from the vilest, lowest, one-eyed outlaw to the most exalted king, all speak like they've just graduated from college with a degree in English, and (2)the good guys always win or die heroically. The plot is somewhat predictable. Worthwhile reading for science fantasy fans, but not a great series."
4,Stereo Instructions,Very heavy book. No like lug heavy book. Chuck heavy book at copywriter NERD.Me graphic designer.Book no good. Give hernia.
1,Kleppner's Advertising Procedure 17th Ed. Review,"I am not a fan of this seller. I have order this book over a month ago, and I have not yet recieved this book. I have tried to contact the seller, but I have gotten no response."
3,OK for tea leaves,"I wanted a non-metal, non-plastic tea strainer. I also wanted a glass straw so as not to stain my teeth. This product seemed to have both. The end you put in your mouth has been crimped (flattened a bit). This probably gives a more comfortable feel but also makes it extremely difficult to clean out the inside of the straw. The opening is too small to push pretty much anything into the straw. After six months of use the ball end is a bit discolored and ready for some cleaning. Maybe you could just boil it in water for awhile.The holes in the ball end are smooth (i.e. formed when the glass is soft not cut after the glass is hard) which is nice. They are probably too big for fine powder tea but work OK for leaf tea."
1,Poorly Written,"This is considered the essential book on the subject... not by composers but, I am sure, just by students who simply have been told as much by their teachers. As a composer I can assure you that this is not a well-written or thoughtfully organized book. The musical examples are fairly limited and, quite simply, anyone who is interested in orchestration will not get good information here. I don't want to go on about it... it's just not a good book!"
3,UnEven Trilogy,While the stories and the characters were likable. I have read better from Nora Roberts. If want great Nora Roberts read Hot Ice.
2,difficult to read,"first of all, this book is difficult to read because not only the complicated explanation but also the auther sometimes changes the notations suddenly. these make this book be difficult. if there is another choice, it should be chosen."
3,"These need to go back in manufacture, not cheap",A lot of people own the Scentstorie disc machine. Why they quit making them nobody knows. They were more reasonably priced when they were still being manufactured. They are quite costly on here. Cost is a big factor for these.
2,random file shuffling on a laptop,"Sonically, this could be a complex sequence of computer noises in chaotic order that only Otto knows, or just random file shuffling on a laptop. The lone, standout exception is ""Tympanic Calcoolus"" with an MC desperately attempting to transmit from the apocalypse, a bare beat to guide him.Meaning, if you're the type of person eager for a fractured, excruciatingly long headgame, you have some exemplary material. The other 99.9% of you will last just ten minutes, tops - guaranteed."
5,Best appliance ever owned,"This product FAR exceeded my expectations. Convenient, easy to clean, compact and plenty of power to pulverize ice cubes. I can't really say enough good things about it. My whole family is using the every day and it is holding up well. I'll be buying more containers soon."
2,Where did they get the tab?,"Beware, Grossman plays the songs on this dvd, but never shows you how to play them. The tab is so different from the way he plays the songs that you have to learn them by ear. Inaccurate tab seem to be the norm with Grossman's material. It's really too bad, because he's a great guitar player. I would love to sit down with Grossman and make him play these songs using the tab provided. Come on Stefan, buck up and proofread your material before you put it on the market."
2,Agree with Shemp; disappointing tab,"I agree with Shemp Newberg's review. I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs, which I've raved about. I got this one to begin learning bottleneck. The tab is not what he's playing (or rather, he plays 80% plus embellishments), so you can't duplicate his songs unless you can play by ear. Very disappointed. Guess I'll seek another intro to bottleneck. On a positive note, there are terrific historical clips of bottleneck legends, if you like that stuff (which I do)."
2,you get what you pay for,"I ran out, last minute, to buy this for my children (ages 6 & 8), with hopes of educating them with activities. I cannot get the disks to install. My computer is brand new and meets all the system requirements. If I can still return this, I will. I am trying to save money on tutors, and I am only wasting my time trying to get this to install. Well, looking at the box, isn't very educating! I also thought, if this is supposed to be a product to educate children, why is there a ""typo"" on the subject heading of of the installation instructions.This product could be a great thing, if I get it to work.I am gonna go retro with this one, good old fashion workbooks."
5,Excellent Hitch,"Precisely as listed. Fast shipment. Perfect fit. Good price. I can't think of anything more to wish for except someone coming over to my house to bolt it on for me! Thanks, great purchase."
2,Good but flawed,"Hard to find show. The package arrived in perfect condition. The second disk skips through the entire first episode. I tried to clean the disk; to no avail. Even the second and third episodes on the disk skip, though not as much. In the end I paid 100 bucks and it still had problems. I don't know"
3,Book not in the best of shape,"although the book probably started in good condition, the seller did not package it properly and it came with cover and first 100 or so pages horribly bent."
4,it is great my friend said,l got this for a friend and right now she told me that her period is regular and hopefully she will be preganat in her next ovulation.
4,Worth a shot!,"I gave this item 4 stars, not 5, only because I am not pregnant. :( I received 1 month supply quickly along with free pregnancy tests! Sure gives you hope!My cycle was not really irregular/nor do I have fertility problems (that I know of) but took this as my hormones seemed out of whack after a loss. My body did not give me any of the usual signs indicating AF was coming, it just would happen.If you have greater irregularity or fertility issues, I would recommend thinking about a 3 month's supply. I took 1 month's supply and the very next AF had the signs that were missing. Here's hoping for next month!! Goood luck to you also!"
3,Sharp initially,Super sharp paring knife until you use it a few times and then you have to sharpen it again. I was hoping it would stay sharper longer.
4,Great little knife,"These knives are great, I was just expecting them to be a bit sharper. Some reviewers comment that you can slice through cheese like butter... Maybe that would be true if the cheese were at room temperature and not right out of the fridge. :)All in all, I do like these knives. I like the non-stick surface, which works great. I like the cases they come in, because the point of the knives are extremely sharp. These knives are very versatile and I would recommend them, just not as good as I expected."
2,Not great,I bought these after trying a wax that was messy and annoying. I really don't like these very much. They are easy since they are prepared and warm quickly. They don't work great on course hair but fine leg hair would probably be okay. I'll use the ones I have but won't buy them again.
1,Not so quick and easy,"Maybe it's because I'm not used to waxing myself, maybe it's because I don't have a wax warmer, maybe I didn't let my hair grow long enough...whatever the issue, this kit is not as quick and easy as it claims to be. I found it to be very messy and not very effective. I almost ran out of strips before I was finished with one leg. I had to go over the same spots multiple times, and still ended up using my razor to finish the job. It may work better if you are more experienced or possible have a wax warmer. Who knows. I only know that it didn't work for me and that it's not really worth the time, money, or clean-up in my opinion."
3,"Great, but not that great","Another reviewer said they sounded like a second rate autechre...which is a very true statement. Don't get me wrong, the first four tracks are worth the price of the cd alone, but the rest doesn't follow. The first four tracks are quite memorable and incredible. The rest of the cd is rather forgettable though."
1,Nu Age Shimmer Sugar Overload Maquerading as IDM,You folks are cracked. This is the sappiest and goofiest collection of synth washes and predictable rhythms I've ever had to endure. Give your self a week and puke this purile sound-escape into the used bin next to their other failed attempts at difficult (yet oh so quirky) releases. Plaid have finally lived up to their name. They should call the Black Dog back home.
3,ok,"light worked well for two days, then the night light led blub blew. Other than that its working fine. i'm searching for a replacement led bulb.The cooling fan that another customer spoke about confuses me, there is a cut out on the side that suggests there is a cooling fan, but as far as i can see... no cooling fan. don't think you need a cooling fan for a pc light anyway..."
4,Good for what it's good for,Nothing really wrong with this case. It looks great and does are fair job at protecting my Palm TX. I work in a very rough and tumble environment and my palm has survived. I have had a problem with the with it slipping out the case a little and making the buttons kind of difficult to get to. Other wise not bad for the price
3,nice case,"It's a nice case with good coverage of a TX. I find 2 drawbacks. When the case is closed, the power cable can't easily connect to the jack. Obviously the data cable can't connect, because the strap crosses right over it, however, there's no reason they couldn't have made the strap slightly smaller and made it easy for the power cable to hook up when the case is closed. The second drawback is major, in my mind. I didn't want a clip on the back. You can remove the swivel clip, and the knob. However, there is no cover for the sharp track the knob is clipped into. A blank cover would be awesome, but Krusell doesn't seem to see that as a reasonable option. Oh well. Still a nice case..."
2,London ain't got the same soul.,"Get the Broadway recording, the limeys sound like vocalizing robots. It's still good because the material rocks, but every listen I can't help but compare it to the NYC crew, and they come up lacking every time. This is definitely not a quintessential Hair recording."
3,caracteristique,"i'm french and i want a description of the Jean claude van damme collection (song title, time ...) thanks for your help, i search this album since a long time"
3,Very Good Concert,"I have been a Johnny Taylor fan since about 1967, so I can tell you with confidence that this is likely the best J.T. concert you will find on DVD. Sadly, there are a few classic songs which he did not perform such as Disco Lady, Cheaper to Keep Her, and Your Love is Rated - X which would have made this live performace complete. However, overall this is a very good concert, in a small night club setting, which was a great venue for him. Johnny is in very good voice and this is the best a fan could hope for based upon scarcely available DVD performance of classic musical artists."
2,Poor quality,I bought this to keep my skin and hair from drying out. I think this is just a poor quality material--I took it off my pillow after about a week. It was somewhat uncomfortable to sleep on and did not make a difference in my skin or hair. I'll try one that costs a little more.
2,Synthetic Band tracks.,"I am a die hard Dells fan but even I chose not to own this cd album. The songs are not bad, the vocal performances are o.k. but the musical backing tracks are disturbing, simulated, synthetic, synthesizer sounds. How this cd ended up on Stax label is a mystery to me but maybe this is why Stax went belly up. The Dells could have done much better than this."
1,fast but weak,The saucer is very fast and fun until the children hit rough snow or ice then it dents and bends and the ride becomes very rough.
2,Disappointing,"Pretty disappointing. The book is about 3 x 5 inches and maybe a quarter of it is taken up by vocabulary that is easily available in other guidebooks or on the web. The rest of the information is either common sense or easily available (e.g., rules for riding the train). Instaed of this, I recommend either a good guidebook (Rough Guide, Lonely Planet, or Rick Steves) and some of the betetr web sites (trip advisor, slow travel)"
3,Little Book,"This tiny book was as helpful as its size. Most of the info is readily available from other sources and since the author does not update the edition, it is often not accurate."
3,Saturday the 14th,"Was very happy to find this has been released to DVD, and am very glad to have this as it is better than what I had. But this does not look ""remastered"". It looks like a very good video copy was recorded onto DVD (and even so there are several bad video spots including lines and white speckling) which detract from the enjoyment. However this is probably the best we will ever see so if you enjoy this movie like me I'd definitely buy it."
3,Brother ink cartridges,"Ink cartridges were received very quickly. However, the printer broke down before I could use them. But the packaging was great and I had used others with this brand name and was very satisfied with them."
1,Desktop Printer Stand w/Drawers - Cherry,"Poor communication. I was notified that the printer was not coming when they said it would, but was never given another date. After waiting some time I cancelled the order and said I ordered another one from someone else. I guess they don't read their email either. The next day they shipped the item. Now I have two, but am not going to spend another $20 to ship it back to them. Believe me I would never buy from this company again!"
5,allergies,I use this product to boost my immune during the allergy season. Can get expensive as my body needs 9 caplets or so a day keep the itchy eyes and sneezing at bay.But it WORKS!
4,Great Hairspray,"I used this hairspray for several years, and suddenly couldn't find it in any stores. After waisting money trying other sprays, I resorted to searching online for this product and found the best price on Amazon.It was very easy to order and I received the product in just a few days. I would definitely do this again."
3,Nice but wrong,Recieved the product in a timely fashion only to find that they sent be the wrong sized product.
2,Worst directions ever,"You are totally on your own with these directions. Some of the assembly is intuitive; some is not. It just takes persistence--lots of it. Mounting this guard to your table is an epic. Once in place, which requires a machinist's skills, it works fine."
4,A thumbs up and a good helper book for BPD clients,"For those just starting to accept the BPD self and are willing to take responsibility for moving towards wellness, this book is definitely one to keep close by. I have personally found it a self-soothing tool, even before I started attending a DBT - based therapy group. The simply presented, easy to understand exercises, along with the mid-level BPD information and positive affirmations from the author make this book a nice stand-alone for those frustrating nights when you need a gentle reminder, or as an adjunct to DBT. Definitely worth the modest investment. There is also a workbook available separately that can be helpful as well."
4,Great CD,"I must say I loved disc 1 of this set. It is awesome! By far one of the best CDs I own right now. Disc 2 didn't appeal to me as much. It wasn't at all what I expected- just too much of the same repetative house over and over. There were a few very good tracks on it, and I'm not saying it's not good, but it does not compare to the first disc.Club Nation America is definitely a must own cd. Buy it... NOW"
4,Disc 2 is where it shines,"Disc 1, mixed by Johnny Vicious, is the weaker of the two. It starts with three really strong trance songs, then gets into a glut of cheesy, anthemic trance. Seriously, he makes Oakenfold sound like Digweed, ""Los Angeles"" era...It's mixed extremely well, very smooth transitions. If you're a fan of the genre, it'll be your cup of tea; if not, then it's up to Tall Paul.TP delivers a very diverse mix of trance, house, and breaks. He includes the UNSTOPPABLE ""I Wanna Be U"" by Chocolate Puma (this track is blowing UP!!!), ""Star 69"" by Fatboy Slim (which works really well in this set), and others. Tall Paul is the highlight of the album.Overall, it's a great disc, especially if you can find it for under $15. Johnny Vicious may not be right for you, but Tall Paul will seal the deal for ya..."
3,"Worth owning, but not fantastic","Ministry of Sound has a long history of producing sold collections of club, dance, and chill music. This album is their club offering for 2001. I'm more of a fan of their ""Chilled 1991-2008,"" collection, but wanted to give this album a try.Basically it is not a bad collection, but most of the tracks are not really that moving. Like others have noted, the first CD is a lot better than the second, but even the first isn't more than 3.5/5 stars.If you're really into club music, or just love Ministry of Sound this might be worth picking up. Otherwise take pass."
3,Great for the price!,"I ordered a pair of these to live at my office. (I also have another pair in my car) They are are heavy, I would not travel with them, they would be terrible to have to put in and take out of the car. <y other pair is a pair of Walk Easy I've had for 10+ years. My issue with them is that the cuff is open so if you let go of the hand grip they fall on the floor, where my other pair the cuff is almost fully closed so that I can let go of the hand grip and not have the crutch fall. This was not described in the item description and had I known I might not have bought these. They are strudy and easy to adjust for height (I am 5'4"".)All in all they fit the bill and fit my price needs (OK so I used Amazon points to cover the cost)."
4,Buy at Walmart not online...,Just a quick heads up for anyone who is considering buying this product...I bought it today at Walmart for only $9.00. SO save the extra cash and go out and get this one in the store. My son loves it. He is only two and I let him play with it with supervision so that I know he's not pulling off the foam protectors. Hope this helped someone.
1,Not worth the money it takes to reverse-engineer it...,"We bought one of these at Walgreen's and could not get all of the blue plastic bases to connect. Sense we shouldn't have to reverse-engineer it, we returned it and went to a local Meijer store. Unfortunately, this brand was all they had for lawn water toys, so we did not buy anything else.Also, as others have noted, the actual product is a lot smaller than the photo suggests and the packaging smells bad when you open it."
3,very basis unless you want the mystics,"The first three chapters are a great overview of the process and some motivation, but the remainder of the book is a religious type of text. If your not willing to buy into the mysticism of it as a type of religion than this book is not for you. Of you are looking for a higher power this book is cetainly for you"
5,Practical Guide to Creative Visualization,"Frankly, this book was purchased as a gift to a friends and was promptly forwarded on. I have yet to hear anything positive or negative from her regarding this publication.I gave it a 5 since I have other books by the same authors and have found them informative.Spirit One"
2,Nada que ver,"A la verdad que me decepcionaron con este cd.Yo esperaba mas de este grupo cuando el disco salio a la venta lo compre lo escuche como 3 o 4 veces esperando que it was going to grow on me but nothing perdi mi dinero. Yo esperaba un cd como el anterior ""MAKE WAY"" ese disco si que me gusto tenian como que mas energia tenian esa mezcla de hiphop con bachata y cantaban en spanglish pero en este tienen nueva integrante que no me gusta como canta me gustaba la otra mejor.La mayoria de la canciones la canta Eunel desde el principio como hasta la numero 10 o 11 las otras dos las canta la nueva integrante.Creo que me gustan como 2 o 3 canciones de 13 con eso te lo digo todo. NADA QUE VER............"
1,"Truly awful ""book""","I think the author was trying to be funny when she wrote this supposed 'book.' I am a novice when it comes to authoring help systems, and as I read through this book I could not figure out why I wasn't understanding much. After much consideration, I realized that the headings in this book are resembling headings for a help system, in that they are mostly gerunds. This wouldn't be such a problem if beneath the headings, the author would actually have written paragraphs explaining the material. Instead, most of the content in the book is bulleted--as if they were steps you'd follow in a procedure!! To say the least, this book is disjointed. It is not for people seeking to learn about writing help systems."
1,broke in two months,"I was attracted to the features of this radio, but i should have listend to the reviews. The detchable face broke in a couple of months."
5,Bob Crewe Generation-Memories!,Brings back wonderful memories and instantly upbeats your mood...not to mention dance to the tunes!
4,Great book,"Needed this book for a class, and I actually enjoyed the book even though I hate to read. Came in time to use it. Thanks"
3,practical case,"Case works well under rainy conditions when running but is not convenient for regular use under dry conditions - this is because the hold slider is not accessible without opening the unit. The click wheel operating gizmo works ""OK"" when needed outdoors but is not convenient."
5,hard to beat phones,We purchased this system 3 years ago and have had great luck with it. We have 3 cordless handsets also and we are very satisfied with all of them. We have never found a reason to buy any larger GHz systems. We use the phones throughout our 4000 sq. ft. home. This system is a keeper for us.
5,Great Condition,"Product came in perfect condition, in a timely matter. Plus this show is one of the best, kind of expensive for only 6 episodes but it's worth it."
4,Zombies,"Interesting show, although not as good as the comics so far. Good price for the Blu-ray version but thats probably because there is only like 8 episodes in the first season. I have high hopes for the next season, but I usually hate tv series after the first or second season so we will see. I am up to volume 10 on the comics so I can see how this could potentially be a very good series."
5,Pleasantly gory..finally a Zombie series!,"It is about time they made a good zombie show for tv. Vampires and werewolves are so overdone now. We are hardcore zombie fans and this show was one we waited along time for. The special effects are great. I haven't read the series, and I don't want to, yet. It is fun watching the storyline unfold. I was glad to hear they ordered 13 more episodes, instead of the short six episode season.If I could say anything bad about it, there are parts that could have more zombies in it. I think everyone should watch it at least once or twice and form their own opinion."
2,Walking Drad Marathon,I bought this to catch up before the season starts with part 2. So far I'm unimpressed. It's rather shadow and easily prdictabe. Not the two things I look for in a weekly series.
5,Bought as a gift,"Another gift for my fiance, the first season of the show is excellent, I cannot wait to watch the special edition version with him"
2,Decent Show but Horrible Audio,"I enjoyed the show, forgiving some of the little things that annoyed me. But the two disk Blu Ray version has a SERIOUS AUDIO PROBLEM!!!! The volume of the conversation on screen would go from barely audible to VIOLENTLY LOUD as soon as any action occurs. I understand the concept of raising the volume to denote the action but this isn't a little adjustment. I would have to turn my volume up to 50 to hear the conversation then it would get so loud I had to turn the volume down to 20 during action sequences only to have to adjust the volume back to 50 when the conversation started again. This issue alone cost it 2 stars IMHO."
3,2/3 of a Great Show,"For starters, I'll say that I've followed the Walking Dead comic series prior to viewing the show, but it hasn't colored my feelings that much.The first 4/6 episodes of this season are powerful, emotional, frightening and great. I'm saying this in spite of the fact that many of the characters on the show are either wooden or unlikable.The series begins with a bang (literally) and races along in a rush for survival, but slams on the break by episode 5 (of 6).The production values on the show are film quality. Things look great and feel real. For the most part, the acting is good, but there are a few bad actors and they can unfortunately overpower scenes at times.If you're up for a show that's a little disturbing (not scary, disturbing) that takes you for a ride, this can be a good show. While I'm not head over heels for it, I know I'll come back for more in subsequent seasons."
4,"Show is 5 stars, picture quality 4","I barely watched the first episode for Season 1, and i gotta say simply magnificent. The story is good, there's a lot of suspense, keeps you thinking between ""yes"" and ""no""I bought the season 1 HD (Amazon Instant Video), and i have to say some scenes are not so HD like. And yes, i do have a fast internet connection. I experience scuffs in a couple of scenes. My only explanation would be if by HD, this shows it in 720p, and not 1080. For the most part though, the show will grab your attention and those scuffy HD scenes may not bug you."
1,amazon unbox video,I ordered this and expected a dvd in the mail. Make sure you know what your getting this isnt a dvd it down loads on your computer and you cant watch it on your tv unless you can hook it up to the internet. This is a major hassle i ended up just going back and buying it agian on dvd. Buy The Walking Dead on dvd NOT AMAZON UNBOX VIDEO!
3,THIS IS HD??????????????,"Wow, really disappointed in the picture quality of the Blu ray. Really grainy. Great show, but not worth the price of a Blu ray. Buy the DVD."
5,Awesome Series,"An awesome character-driven series that gets you hooked by the very first episode. It arrived a day early, and just in time to re-watch season 1 in time for the season 2 premiere."
5,Drama that RIPS YOU APART!,I love zombie movies....but they all stink (Exception: 28 Days) compared to this masterpiece of drama. It seems like it IS happening instead of fantasy.The drama sinks it's teeth into your neck and rips you apart.LOVE IT!
5,Zombie Love,"I purchased this to see what the fascination was with Zombies, Oh my goodness its got great writing and direction. I quickly purchased the other seasons as well. I love this series!"
5,Honest review,"To be honest, at first, I didn't care for all the hype of the walking dead, it sounded like every other zombie film ever made, and then I actually watched it, and it blew my mind. The whole concept is astoundingly shot where you start to think about what ifs... some scenes make you want to puke, others pull on your heart strings it is a fantastic series and with actors that fit the comic to the point its creepy. I bought this after I found I liked it, and worried that it might not be worth it, I found it totally is. Granted the first season is only 6 episodes but there is so much bonus footage I don't feel ripped off at all. Great deal, and the spammer who said the section where they chop the guy up, isn't there, it absolutely is, so he or she got a defective purchase, or is just being a noob. Though I would go with the second, I have never once regretted a buy on Amazon. Buy it, it is a steal!"
3,Okay,"I had high hopes going into The Walking Dead but I was disappointed. I watched the whole first and second seasons. It was ok, but not great. The main problem is that it's so hollywoodized and cliché in terms of emotions, acting, and plots. It suffers from having very simple plots and nearly zero political or artistic relevance. It just doesn't appeal to me as much as Game of Thrones, True Blood, Star Trek, and other series that seem to attract the best and brightest artists, designers, and writers by using fantasy as a means of addressing controversial issues from a metaphorical distance."
4,Zombies+ more!,This was great. I had seen season 3before the begining and thought it wasok but then I bought the first season andit all made more sense. If you like zombiesthis is a excellent series. The best part aboutThe Walking Dead is that it goes far beyond zombies andpulls real people with real issues into the mix.Most other zombie movies or series are justanother zombie killing excuse.
2,"Great Plot, Too Graphic and Gorey",Love the story and plot. Great acting. Good photography and visuals. I made it through 3 episodes by closing my eyes at some of the gore. I also had to resort to plugging my ears during a scene of chopping up a zombie body with an ax that went on forever. I couldn't watch and all the splattering blood and organs or stand the graphic sound effects. Too much violence for me..... It would be a 5 star if only there was less gore.
1,This is sooo bad......omg......,"Predictable, unoriginal and all around retarded. Resident Evil with 1/100th the budget - ugh, had to ff through it. How can it be getting good reviews?? WOW"
2,Great Show! Terrible product!,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of the show. The show is split in two discs, which is all cool, but the second disc is not bluray. How does this work out?? I would've given five stars (cause everything was great), but if I spend extra for bluray, I expect the whole product to be bluray."
2,"OK at best, not worthy of all the 5 star reviews.","I got through the first season (with a lot of fast forwarding after the first episode). The first episode was good, but my fear came to be realized, 90% of each episode being nothing but people sitting around talking to each other about their zombie problems. And after the first show, the zombies are lame and almost non-existent. I supposed since it's TV, they want to keep their budget low, hence fight scenes/zombies become less frequent. Final episdoe of season 1 had to be the worst - talk talk talk and you saw about 30 seconds (literally 30 seconds) of zombies. WTF ? I won't be buying season 2."
5,What's not to like about The Walking Dead!!!,"Of course, you must be a Walking Deadhead to like this, and if you're not yet, all you have to do is watch and you'll be sucked in! I do not like slasher/blood and gore movies so for me that's not the attraction. What captured me was the human interaction in extreme survival mode while trying to maintain human decency. Of course, special effects are quality and the violence is necessary for the theme to be realistic. Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, and Stephen Yeun are so REAL in their characters, you have to believe them. All of the main character actors, so far, have been so excellent, you're immediately captured and taken on their trip for 60 minutes on Sunday night!!!!"
4,Sociology and a canable economy (not a joke hear),As some one who has spent time in 3rd world war zones both as a member of the military and later as a NGO aid worker (medic) I find shows like this when done well with human interaction being the driving theme excelent. While the zombie horror element is there its still basicly man vs nature in this case a pathogen or similer. The human condition does not change just becuse the enviroment does and it was refreshing to see that even when survival was on the line hatred like meryls rasict manner as well as internal conflict was alive and well. Its not the zombies that make this a stand out show for me its the human interaction. I have never seen the graphic novel. But have seen aid workers taking fire during Katrina while trying to help out with bodies rotting in the streets Angola and Balad in 2007 was not much diffrent. This show does a great job of showing the animal that lurks under every one who calls themselves a human.
4,The Walking Dead Soap,"Okay, now I've always saw this as modern Dark Shadows meets Night Of The Living Dead and still don't feel wrongly doing so.. It is a bit soapy, but hey don't lose heart, I loved Dark Shadows (the original series). The basis of this story is for some, still unknown reason, the dead rise to eat the living and over run the bulk of us. A small town copy wakes from a coma into this world. He goes on a desperate search for his wife and son. I'll leave it at that. After watching season one and two again I like it better."
5,Amazing!,"The best show I have seen in a long time. The story makes you care about everyone. Acting is a little weak in this season, but it gets better."
3,Decent,The walking dead is one of my favorite tv series of all time. So I decided hey why not buy this? So I bought it and well the disc is fine but there are scratches and marks that were all over the case and disc. This was worth my money but I wish that the condition was better for what i paid for it.
5,Gotta Love It,"The product was great. I am now awaiting the Season 2, which you can pre order. I don't want to do this. I rather get it when you have it. So Bring it"
4,EXCELLENT SHOW but I knocked off one star for special features.,"I'm absolutely addicted to this show and cannot wait for Season 2 to come out in October (Kirkman says that he thinks it might be better than Season 1), but I wish there were more special features on this DVD set. You'd think they would have packed more of them in this set considering the season was only six episodes long. Deleted scenes would have been nice. Oh well, this DVD set is well worth the money for anyone who is a fan of the show. I've watched each episode numerous times already and have definitely gotten my money's worth. Hopefully the Season 2 set will have more special features."
1,My friends warned me...,"Despite the general positive reviews of this show, I just couldn't get into it. Mostly for the poorly-explained plot lines, and the stereotypes (I turned it off when I heard the Hispanic gang member use the Spanish word for ""hooker."")"
1,Don't Get Started,"This show fizzles out far too quickly. And then season 2 is a huge let down. The zombies are almost an after-thought. The characters try to fill the story, but they're just not interesting. Post apocalyptic zombie infected Earth would be far more interesting than this show. Don't start on this, go watch something else."
1,The Talking Dumb,"What can you expect from the walking dead? Well you can expect zombies for about 2 minutes of the show, than the rest is people sticking their face in each other's comfort zone and grunting off bad soap oprea-esque dialogue, frequent amounts of children acting cute, and Mexican cholo's with hearts of gold. Proceed at your own risk."
1,AVH: Alien Vs. Hunter,"AVH, or so they call it is a movie from The Asylum. Those words alone would deture most b-movie fans to run away. However if you must know its a total rip-off of AVP like all The Asylums Low Budget Spin-offs. The worst thing about it is they make a mockery of the predator franchise by putting a lantern on the ""predator""s Head.When a ship crashes next to a small town, the sheriff is facing an extra-terrestrial alien and its hunter. He band together with a few locals and head to a local farm to set up a defensive position. This is where i took the disc out of my DVD player. I Could Not Finish It.Wreaking of bad acting, Horrible cinamatoraphy and goofy production design. AVH is a true [...] Film and another joke from The Asylum Home Entertainment."
1,Stop making bad movies please???,"Yet another horrible ""movie"" you would think they would have to get better, but no, they churn out one after another. The company responsible for this mess should be shut down in shame. Low budget doesn't have to be this bad!"
3,Three Stars for the Characters,"Alien vs. Hunter is entertaining. The plot has some holes, and the last minute of the movie is idiotic. The special effects are poor to average. The Hunter costume is a clunker. Still . . .Most of the characters have a pre-movie history with each other, and that makes their interactions natural. William Katt is certainly not a macho hero, but he comes through in the end. Dedee Pfeiffer does a good job with her character. All of the characters, even the extremely minor characters, are believable.As a previous poster indicates, the commentary is lively and revealing."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"When it comes to bad, this movie has it all; bad acting, bad script, bad fx, bad aliens. From start to finish AVH does not let up in emphasizing that a bad movie can be just that ..... really, really bad. Enough said, AVH just doesn't deserve a longer or more thoughtful review."
2,"""Like New"" - Not True","I got the movie quickly. It was listed as being ""Like New"" but the DVD case had a large hole in it and the disc was very scratched. I would probably not order from this supplier again. Movie was average."
1,Wow....,"Not only did the movie not match with the book (even with important aspects of the story,) but the overall quality and presentation of the story was terrible. If you're honestly considering buying this movie, then I'd recommend you go read the book instead. It may take longer, but the overall quality and greatness of this story will come through. The book is wonderfully. I've read it about 4 times and could pick it up again at anytime. Don't waste your money, you'll be sorry. Go buy the book instead. It's a better buy for your money."
3,so bad it's funny,"I truly enjoyed this movie. But I find no genre funnier than low-budget horror. The special effects, scare scenes, and music in this film were all terrible. The acting might have been half decent, had the actors been given something to work with. There is at best minimal relation between this film and the book by Dean Koontz (the book was good). So if you want a movie that follows the book, or a movie to scare you, or just a good movie, don't waste your time and avoid this one...this film is what you're looking for. I can't rate it well for horror, but for hilarity, it gets a 3."
2,Don't Buy This Product,"Although a great and humane idea, this bug vac is not built to last. We've had it less than a year, and it's nearly dead. Parts have cracked, the AC connector came loose, and now we get about 5 minutes use from a day-long charge. We'll just rely on our regular vaccum, which is bagless and--although giving the bugs a bit of a ride--enables us to release them outside.We would also warn folks in the south that this thing has trouble with serious bugs--like the so-called palmetto bugs we get in South Florida. They are too big and strong to be easily sucked into this device."
3,its ok...,"i had hoped the suction would be stronger. as it is youll only really be able to use this on slow moving crawlers. its not strong enough to suck up flying insects unless you pin them to a wall with itif you have problems with spiders and other slow movers, this is useful so that you dont get smears on your walls from swatting them"
4,Works perfectly for what it does.,"My wife loves this thing, couldn't have done better with a gold necklace. She doesn't need to get near the little creatures and it pulls in everything. One small issue I had to fix the switch already, good thing I do things like that. Otherwise this is a good device priced right."
3,idea works rechargeable vacume,I ordered two of these vacumes. The first one works great and sucks up spiders and box elder bugs with ease. The second unit I ordered for my Father in law. When inspecting everything we noticed the charger plug was broken at the transformer with exposed wires showing.
2,Somewhat shoddy workmanship,"After about 10 years my old Everlast wristbands no longer had any more stick left to their velcro, so I sprung for these. Unfortunately, I really cannot recommend them for regular weightlifting use.The velcro strip containing the ""loops"" do not run long enough along the surface when pulling a really tight wrap, and the overlap area begins to fray pretty quickly from the ""hooks"" of the velcro. Within 2 weeks, the labels sewed into the underside marking ""left"" and ""right"" fell off, which was a bad sign of things to come. Finally within another 2 weeks or so, the stitching on the velcro strip that contains the hooks separated from the rest, rendering them basically useless.There's really not too much that a solid wrist wrap needs to do, but in my experience, these failed at most."
3,Mixed blessing,"This book started off so well. In fact, I was enjoying the beginning and middle portions so much I purchased several copies for friends and family. Unfortunately, the end of the book takes a bit of a nose-dive. It is clear throughout the book that the author has suffered a terrible personal loss... though she never directly states it, it is implied that perhaps her marriage has ended. While that in and of itself is not an issue, it seems she may have been writing the book while she should have been grieving for the loss and recuperating in the loving arms of God... instead, parts of the book seem like they are written to her husband as sort of an in-your-face message. Of course, I cannot be sure of that, but it does come across that way in parts. She has a great message going-- it is beautiful to hear the relationship of our God to us as she describes it, but I think she was trying to convince herself at the time of the writing and it sort of breaks your heart for her struggle."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,LOVE THIS BOOK. It was loaned to me and then I purchased it for myself.This book helps me to see how Jesus loves me just as I am. I have also given this book to a friend.
3,Mixture of help and unbiblical foundation,"Some of the parts are good and helpful, like learning to see the soul clutter and how to quiet the noise in our heads.... but if you read the study guide that goes along with this book it's all about you. What YOU want to do, what YOU want to dream.. the main theme is that God wired us to dream big and do what we want with our lives, which directly contradicts the Bible! Our lives are not our own - they belong to Christ Jesus: ""You are not your own, you were bought at a price""! So beware. Use the tools in the book wisely!"
4,Sunny delight,"A delightful period piece from the summer of 1966, and a stronger-than-expected collection of sunny folk-rock with great harmonies and subtle psychedelic tinges. The original LP is fleshed out with seven bonus tracks, some from as late as mid-1967, most of which are quite good and the last of which is an excerpt from a 1960s radio interview. The booklet notes are quite excellent."
5,Possibly the best 1980's compilation album series made,"Awesome! Pop and Wave are import albums. They are a series of albums from Germany and for the most part, the songs on them represent popular music from Germany during the 1980's. Therefore, the songs on here aren't always the ones you hear constantly on 80's radio stations or hear on other 80's compilation discs. In other words, what you've got here is a catalogue of really cool music that you not find compiled elsewhere. Oh, it has the hits from the U.S., but it has songs that received little air play here too. It's truly a cool set. I highly recommned it!"
5,best deal on the internet,"We use lots lots of this type of jersey gloves every winter season. Is it good or bad? I think we got used to the jersey feeling a lot. I found this on amazon last year and not sure this is the same quality as we use it before, because simply the price is too good to be true. Anyway, so I bought a dozen, since the min buy is one dozen. Well, I have to let everybody know that I am very happy with the quality and price. would buy again."
2,"poor sizing, feels like it will fall off.","These were poorly sized. They fit fairly tight until the middle of your palm but flare out from there instead of at the wrist like your typical slip on glove. They also have no elastic to hold them on your wrist. The gloves feel like they will fall off, and easily fill up with leaves/debris/etc. They do not give a sure fit and feel. These also have no elastic to them so that adds to the poor fitment.I decided I will return the product I disliked them so much. It's too bad - the fleece lining was nice."
3,seems to be helpful in providing a energy boost.,"I bought this product due to low energy, and fatigue issues (especially in the afternoon hours before getting off work at 5pm, or as I like to call it, ""The Dead Zone"", LOL).there is a energy benefit you will receive, but you must take the pills CONSISTENTLY. By that, I mean 2 pills in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 2 in the evening. These pills are quickly metabolized and burned by the body, so you have to take them throughout the day; otherwise, there's no benefit (at least that was the case with me). If I missed a dose, or forgot to take them for a day or two, the fatigue would return.again, this product is helpful (as a mild and safe energy boost) if you take it consistently. Also, the price is good (I recommend all Swanson products)."
5,Thick and Creamy....,On the HCG diet and my skin was so itchy due to not being able to use any moisturizers. This product saved me. It doesn't have the greatest scent when you first apply but it quickly goes away and leaves your skin feeling amazing. It's almost like a protective barrier that lasts all day. Feels silky smooth. I will definetly purchase again.
3,"Pretty interesting, but","All I could think of, pretty much the entire time that I was watching it was, damn do I feel sorry for Kirk Hammett..Man, having to deal with those two old ladies (James and Lars) must be a pain in the ass.He must be some kind of saint on top of being a hell of a guitar player."
4,Whining pussies,"The movie is very well done and it shows a side to Metallica that you would never expect them to have, much less be allowed to see. Who knew the gods of metal were such whining pussies when no one was looking? That said, it did take some level of balls to allow the world to see them at their weakest, so there has to be some credit given there. Worth watching, as long as you have no illusions that you don't want shattered."
3,Good Rock Documentary,I thought this was a pretty cool documentary. It was entertaining even if you aren't a fan of their music. It was cool watching the guys interact and try to hold it all together thru all the b.s. that has come into their lives and into their group dynamic.I recommend it.
1,Gabage,"This movie was terrible, over blown and did not need to be made. This only shows a band hopped up on fame and their 20+ years of lacking creativity since 93."
1,a good movie but the band........,"are a bunch of whiners. Now on to the review.I am somewhat of a metallica fan, not huge, but I do have Kill em all through And jusctice for all.This is a very good movie, gives you a look at what its like inside a studio and a band thats going through some turmoil. By the way, James Hetfield is a complete jerk in this movie"
3,Motivational Sales Ideas,I found this book good for motivational sales and employee service/product sales increase. It's a short book but has a large number of great ideas. Also good to bring these ideas at your monthly employee meetings.
4,"Good ""feel good"" Christmas movie","I recorded this movie when it was on T.V., so I have a video that has commercials and would like to own it without, but I'll wait till the price comes down. It was a TELEVISION movie, for goodness sake! But, it is a very cute, heartwarming, story."
5,Angels,We love this movie. It's light and certainly gives you a feeling of Christmas and it's miracles.
2,doesnt play all the way through,"Already opened DVD, Didn't play all the way through. Nothing against seller, just disappointed as this was a gift for my mom and the first DVD I bought her at the store was broken in half. Guess she wasn't meant to have this movie."
2,Some singers need,"to stick with singing. I like Dolly but her acting in this movie was just pitiful! The movie itself is chopped to pieces and hard to follow along. The script is probably a good one but the final film is awful.It is clean and if you can sit through all the awful acting, it can be considered a family movie."
5,Daz Kurupt,It is great to hear from these two artists again. They had their problems but not that is over with and they are back to making albums again. They have been in the game for a long time and know how to please westcoast fans like myself and I am happy with this release but I see somebody giving this album 2 stars which is rediculous cause every album they put out was banging so to that guy go listen to 5-0 cent stop hating on the real gangstas. Recommend real rap fans buy this album.
2,Not that great,"Ima huge DPG fan and I can honestly say that this album is str8 garbage. No disrepsect to Daz but he really slipped up on this album with his flow and lyrics. Kurupt was average. Beats on here were terrible with exception of a few tracks. only good tracks are DPGC Music, Push Bacc. Rest are average or just suck. Wait 4 Cali Iz Active or just listen 2 Dogg Food 4 now. Dont get this album"
3,A good start,"If you haven't heard, DeLillo is one of America's five most important active writers, and this first novel is quintessential to understanding his concerns: writer as exiled pop icon, U.S. culture as reductive poison, etc., all of which we see more finely developed in later works, especially Mao II and White Noise. Sure, there are obvious structural deficiencies here, like the final orgy scene in a Texas warehouse which seems unnaturally appended, but that's what makes the book so great: It's DeLillo's opening salvo in a brilliant career as literary social satirist."
3,Fits most bars,"""Fits all standard bars"" can too easily lead you to believe they fit all 1"" bars.Well, no. Of 8 bars we own, these fit about 4. The spin nuts interchange on all 8 bars, the only way to tell the bars apart is try these collars and find out which ones they fit.Difference not apparent to the naked eye - all our bars are called 1"" bars - your mileage may vary.A list of what bars do and don't work would be nice.That said, they're cheap and durable - try your luck if you dare."
3,"Does Not Fit All ""Standard"" Bars","I have two different ""standard-size"" barbell bars: the spin lock, and a bar bought as part of a set from Modells several years ago. These collars fit the spin lock barbell and dumbbell bars beautifully and prevent the weights from moving to any large degree (but they've been tested at 100lbs. limit). However the collars are way too large for the other ""Modell's"" barbell set bar.I don't dispute that these collars are standard-size collars, but I've discovered that not all bars are standard-size bars. Buyers should be mindful of that before they make their purchase, and measure their bar's diameter to make sure it's 1"" thick before purchasing the collars. If the bar is, these collars are fantastic for the price."
1,"Does not fit a 1"" diameter bar.","Does not fit a 1"" diameter bar. Not even close. Since some people are saying it does, I take it the product's size is not well standardized. Caveat emptor."
3,just okay,"I had a hard time finding the smaller size collars in local stores. All that I could find were for the olympic size bars. These fit my small size bars, but they do not open much when squeezed. I have to squeeze all of the way and then work them back and forth to slide on the bar. Once they're on then they're okay, but it seems like the size is slightly off as far as getting them on/off."
4,Works well for me too,"When I read the reviews for this product, there was an equal number of above average and below average ratings. For the price, I decided to give them a shot. These spring collars fit my weight bar and provide enough tension."
3,"A quick, easy but flawed read","When the Light Goes is a good, quick read. I occasionally pick up a Larry McMurtry novel as a change of pace. His prose in this novel is very loose and moves very quickly, aided by the very short chapters. McMyrtry's description of aging accompanied by illness and lack of virility seems accurate, at least for his main character Duane. However, other than Duane, all the characters seemed a bit two dimensional. It held my attention for 200 pages, but it would have lost me if it was much longer. Also, this reader, although not squeamish, could have done withy out some of the overly graphic sexuality. Like too much of the rest of the book, it made sex very two dimensional and lacked any true feeling or emotion. What a shame for a writer who is capable of so much better!"
1,A token afterthought,"This book read like a cheap afterthought. The sexual scenes were a put off and felt as if they were stuck in the book to spice up a dismal effort. Thank goodness the book is short. The Last Picture Show was great, Texasville was not great but good and the rest of the Duane saga sputters out. This book was not what I expect of a writer of McMurtry's caliber. I honestly felt I was ripped off. Sorry to see it. Skip ahead to another book."
4,"Oui, Oui !!!","Close your eyes, and you are at a Parisian corner cafe, or in a late night bistro where the clientele is not afraid to join in the chorus. The sweet sound of accordions, and uplifting spirit of this compilation make it great listening for cooking French food, and throwing lively parties."
5,Removed the fear of creating web site,"At first, I was excited when ask to create a web site for my company. After reading my first HTML book, that excitement was soon replaced by fear. My company had provided site creation software but I was dumbfounded about where to start. Most of the books I had bought were too advanced for me and I began to think I just couldn't do this web site thing.That was until I discovered this book. It was a good starting off point, visually showing the steps to start creating basic web pages. One week after receiving this book, I had created a web site.Most books are intended to help the reader master the program, this book had just enough information to help me learn the program. Although I now need to purchase another book to help master Dreamweaver, this book still deserves five stars because I would have never been able to learn Dreamweaver without it."
1,"pseudo-intellectual ad hoc rants and the ""no self"" doctrine","In short, I see Scalapino's Zither and Autobiography as pseudo-intellectual name dropping(s)-oops!) which are ad hoc, at best. If there truly is ""no self"" then next time (shut the hell up) stop writing once that is stated because anything else you may have to say does not matter. I save my intense delving into ideas for those that have a ""self."" Aside from some interesting imagery, Zither has nothing of any kind to offer a reader. Do not waste your money on this book! If you find yourself needing a copy, then go to your local library and check it out first. I did not even want to give this book one star, but I had to in order to post this review.P.S. I'll see you in Boise at the reading, Ms. ""no-selfapino!"""
4,Pop that Cristal.,"Pretty good, not as good as Mr.Whipple though. Ogilvy is outdated, especially his 2 previous books. It's a new era, whole game REINVENTED. Me? I'm just getting Started.READ IT, then Break the Rules...Times Change. Flow with your Instinct. Go with your Gut. Collaborate with people you want to work with.<lights up 100 dollar bill and sparks Montecristo #2 Cuban Cigar, pours Cristal>ND ----> Coming Soon."
5,What an album!,"Great melodies, amazing lyrics, pure emotion. This sort of stuff can't be faked. This guy puts his heart in it 100% and it definitley comes through when listening to it. Give this one a shot, you won't regret it."
4,Great inside look into the world of V.C's,Very detailed look into one case study and insight into how the industry started.well written and easy to follow. I would recommend this to anyone curious about the world of Venture Capital
1,very slow shuttles,"We had to attach a penny inside the shuttle to make it go fast. The feathers are also breaking off very quickly. Overall, very poor quality."
5,Powerful and Worthwhile,It took me a while to digest this book as each piece touched me deeply. Every woman who has children or is thinking of having children will benefit from it. Every person who has wondered why things are in life will be reminded how to view life through the love we had when we first began.
2,Disappointed.....,"These boots do indeed serve their purpose in all winter weather, but I was also relying on comfort and they hurt the arch of my foot...I had to buy insoles. The photo does not show the black zipper which I found cheesy, I was suspecting no zipper (maybe I didnt read the details enough)or at least one that was hidden. I do not like shoes where you can't feel a grip on the ground and with these you don't. And last but not least, the upper front part of the boot where the wooley lining is sticks out at a point and looks too damn ridiculous. The lining also, I thought filled the boot a bit like an ugg would, but I was wrong there too. Oh well, I liked the picture and the price, but I made a bad decision."
3,Warm boot but zipper keeps slipping.,Was disappointed with zipper. Hard to get up and slipped after wearing for 20 min and snow came in the boot. Usually likeSorels but this one does not live up to their reputation.
2,Boring Winter Boots,I bought these on the recommendations from this site for my winter boots. The boots seemed warm- but they look kind of frumpy and are very stiff when walking. They don't look good with pants tucked into them- or even with pants over the top. I know that you can't expect too much style from winter boots- but the suede looks cheap and I imagine will stain easily with salt/slush. I'm returning them.
1,Very uncomfortable,"In the past 2 weeks I invested in 10 different pairs of winter boots from Amazon and Sierra Trading Post.These boots are so uncomfortable to wear that my legs started to ache right through.The stiffness was overwhelming as there is no give in the lifting of the foot motion to simply walk.They are also rather heavy as well so the weight and stiffness makes you aware of every step you take.As soon as I took them off the aching subsided and was gone in 5 minutes.Because I finally have winter boots for the first time in my life the novelty will take years to wear off.But these boots will be used only in the worst conditions as to not ruin any of my other boots.Because I live in Australia, postage to return them would cost me more than I paid for the boots and it's not Amazon's fault so I shall keep them."
4,I won't be able to try them out until next winter!,"We kept having storm after storm this winter, so when these boots came on sale I decided to buy a pair. The fit is good and they look really nice, but I won't know for sure how much I like them until next winter when I can wear them in the snow."
2,boots,These boots are warm but not very comfortable. The sole and ankle portion of the shoe are stiff and hard to walk in for any long distance. I was not happy with the way these boots fit or the lack of flexibility when walking. I had bought them for a trip to Russia in March and did not even take them :(
4,Great boots!,"My wife tells me - warm; comfortable; hard soles, makes it more difficult to drive in than other boot she has; while she likes Blondo boots much better overall, she still really likes these."
3,"Interesting, but fails to stick with you","The sum of various talented people does not always equate to the combination of their individual talents. I thought all that Craig Armstrong touched turned into musical gold, but this album failed to stick with me. It sounds too intentional, too engineered, blending in beats and BJork-like voice into the piano and string soundscapes that Armstrong has us used to. In spite of how interesting you may think such a combination may be, it doesn't work out as you'd hope. I am moving on..."
1,Do not waste your money,Unit only lasted for about 16 hours of operation then failed. would not purchase again light duty at best more like a toy.
1,The Worst Movie,"Its one of the Worst Movies ive seen in my whole lifeyou know why ???1- Low budget movie .2- Failure copy of Transformer .3- i dont know how they choose their actors , they don`t know anything about acting .i really don`t know how this movie released on blu-ray its a disgrace for all blu-ray movies ."
1,"Better than ""Transformers 2""","Better than ""Transformers 2""... at least this was supposed to be cheesy. This movie is done in the tradition of camp. I wouldnt even give ""Transformers 2"" one star, if they would let me."
4,"A sweet, sentimental love story.","If you are looking for a nice, sweet story to read...this is a good choice. The quick chapters are written in a way that kept me turning the pages. And in light of all the craziness in the world today, it reminds you that there are still good people out there."
1,Cut-and-dried typical homer broadcaster,"Merril Reese's book is called ""It's Good."" Unfortunately, in my opinion,it's not. I found this to be the typical, cut-and-dried biography of a home-town broadcater whose life is totally defined by one dimension. He's the voice of the home team. That's pretty much it. Unless you eat, sleep and live Eagles football -- and this a 3-13 team now that creates yawns instead of yeahs, I would pass. (The Eagles wish they had a quarterback who could pass.) I guess Merrill won't be writing a sequel anytime soon."
1,Disapointing,This book contains lots of profanity. Seems like it was written like foolish doodling on a computer and was published that way. It is original; but my opinion is that only is 10% worth reading.
5,Great fun on Poppitt,This game is a lot of fun!! Reminds me of popping bubbles from the wrapping used in mailing packages. Just with prizes!!!
3,Fun,"This is such a neat idea! I love the design of it and the general idea of what it does. I would have liked to have had better quality sound on the speakers. Also, it's fine to have a digital tuner, but it doesn't show you what station you are on. It also doesn't keep it on that station when you turn it off and on, so you have to go looking for it again. *Shrugs* Of course, what more can I expect from a shower radio?"
1,"Ew, junk!","I would have given it zero stars but that is not an option. It stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception. It was difficult to get a station. And it was not a problem with the batteries. Run, don't walk, *away* from this!"
1,Big pile of poo,"As soon as the water hit it, the radio's sound tone changed and never was the same again. Waterproof, my foot. If I could give it negative stars I would."
3,It's a bug alright!,"I guess this works. There is always some kind of static, resets to some spanish station when I turn it off. I have to be in the shower for there not to be over whelming static (I give off the power of love). There is a window maybe 3-4 feet away, doesn't help if I point the antenna there, actually works better if I point it at my wing ding (see previous parenthesis regarding giving off the power of love)."
2,Buy something else,"I like the size and the sound quality is decent for what it is, but it's annoying not to have presets for the radio station, as well as not displaying what radio station you're flipping through. Stations that would normally come in clear, are really fuzzy. The battery life is good, but it's not worth the aggravation trying to figure out what you're listening to."
1,This shower radio is all wet!,"I got this as a Christmas present a couple years ago and it just doesn't work. The radio does not come in well, and you can't even tell what stations you are tuning to - it just tunes from one to another with no display of what station you are on. The clock runs slow and will loose about 5-7 minutes a month. Best to save a couple pennies and invest in a better one."
1,Didn't work,I cann't get the radio to work. It is not expensive enough to return. I'll look for another brand. The description says AM/FM but it is only FM.
1,Bad Radio and Clock,I was late to school because the time on the clock doesn't work. It always is slow and the radio sucks. I try to use the radio but the receiver doesn't work. It is also very hard to set the time and date on the clock. The suction cups that connect it to the wall of my shower don't work and i often see the thing fall on my foot in the shower.
1,Sony battery charger,"To charge the battery you need an extra lego peace, or put the battery in special position and the top can`t be closed. It may work first time or not. In my case the product was defect."
3,Doesn't sit flush with the wall,"While the rack does seem quite sturdy, it wobbles quite a bit when there's nothing on it. It just doesn't sit flush with the wall. I will probably shimmy something behind it to keep it from moving if it gets worse."
4,good for the price,"for under 20 dollars its hard to beat. just don't leave water in it for long periods after use. i think some of the bad reviews are from previous revisions, mine seems to work fine. that being said, they seemed to have made different versions. some have stainless steel interior bottoms, others have chromed bottoms. i think the chrome can rust and pit easily so it is a lottery."
1,worst ever,"This one of the worst electric teakettle I have used. Please people don't buy it if you don't want fire on your hands. First of all, you need quite enough might to close lid shut. You may think you closed it but in reality you don't, you have to push it down very hard. Second of all, the filter dislodges very easily. These two reasons are the main cause of automatic shut off function not to shut off at all. So you pour the water put the kettle on and off you go. And you know what- you may came back and notice that plastic kettle almost on a verge of melting because current wasn't shut down by shut off function since filter dislodged itself or lid wasn't really closed or both and it is boiling and boiling and boiling. Very dangerous product indeed."
5,The Titanic,"This review was written by a former college instructor in U.S. History. This is a fascinating book! I thoroughly enjoyed every page of it, as did the friends to whom I loaned or recommended it."
4,Interesting as both political and journalism history,"Behr certainly covered a series of conflicts, mostly tribal or sectarian, but viewed through a cold war lens. His writing gives a glimpse into the events on the ground as well as some insight into the journalism industry. It's a both a relief and a reproof that reportage was sensational long before FoxNews was a cable outlet. If you have an interest in cold war history or combat conflict journalism, this memoir is for you.Best for people who enjoy: military memoirs (""Quartered Safe Out Here"", ""Goodbye Darkness"") or the movies, ""Under Fire"", ""Salvador"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously""."
3,I did not like the ending of this one.,"Kip and Shelley Davies were twins. Since they were little they were told never to go across the street. The Victorian inn was there and they were not to disturb the guests or the owners. As teenagers, they both got their first jobs at the inn. Soon they noticed ""the regulars"" came at certain times. There they practiced their Wicca religion.The Wicca religion's greatest rule is ""An' it harm none, do what thou wilt"". Now the rule has been broken!***Delves into the religion known as Wicca. Describes ceremonies and beliefs. It also shows what evil may befall those who cast spells recklessly. All spells come back to the sender times three! This book gives the reader a glimpse into the human heart. In my opinion, the book, itself, was wonderful. However, I thought the ending was anticlimatic.***"
4,"I really enjoyed the book, but hated the ending.","I really did enjoy the book. I could barely put it down. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because I hated the ending. The personality of Shelley (a main character) under went a dramatic change of personality too quickly. The ending not only seemed to rush by, but it was terrible as well. What happened to her and her brother was the worst part for me. What happened to Kipling (another main character) shouldn't have. All in all, it was a great book with a lousy ending."
3,"Less painful, but not real effective","I usually use Zip wax, but when I ran out this time I decided to try something different. The Zip wax is quite painful since it has to be pretty hot and then it really hurts when you pull it off. This wax does not have to be very warm at all, and it doesn't hurt much when you remove it. But it doesn't seem to work very well on coarse hairs. It works just fine on my upper lip, but on my chin I have pretty thick hairs and I had to keep trying over and over to get all the hairs off. I ended up with a large scab on that area that is still very sore a week later. It's also super messy, but it does clean up easily with oil."
1,Good at first,"I agree with a review that described initial satisfaction with this product, followed by dissatisfaction shortly thereafter. I've owned one, and that was enough until the quality improves. The first problem I had was that the gyro gradually became harder to start. The second problem was the annoying ""clacking"" noise the Powerball developed after a couple months of use. And cleaning the Powerball was no easy task. Additionally, I did take good care of my Powerball; it's just that the design is not as durable as it should be."
1,Got the look..but that's it.,"I have had two of these and both worked well in the first few days and then-gone. The concept Idea is good, but this design needs some serious face lift. Don't even bother.."
3,Great product but weak,"As a tennis player, I liked the idea of this product so much I got two more as gifts (one of them for a fellow tennis player, one for a heavy computer user). They DO provide great exercise for the wrist as well as the entire arm. Alas two of the three have already broken. I have yet to see how the company handles this, as I bought them through my chiropractor and he is returning them, but I read elsewhere that there was a heavy restocking fee. So it is my hope that they will beef these up a bit--and make it clearer what the differences are between models."
1,only part of it arrived,I had to return this because one of the major parts was not in the packaging. I don't know if it would have helped because the piece that makes it go was missing.
5,Fun Ball,"This is a really cool device once you get it started. Actually getting it started is the hard part, it took me over a day to figure out. The instructional video is not helpful at all, because it is misleading. Some of my friends and I spent forever trying to get it to start and no one could make it work.I finally figured out how to get it to work. The trick is you have to get a really good starting spin to begin with, it's very difficult to do without using the starting string they provide. That was my main problem, I kept trying to start it with the ""advanced"" methods such as flicking it with my thumb or ""karate chop"". When I used the string again, and made sure to pull as fast as I possibly could, then I was able to get it going.Then you can just hold your forearm straight and rotate your hand in a circle, you will feel it speeding up. Then you just have to rotate faster to speed it up more, which takes practce and forearm strength to be able to rotate faster."
2,A nice forearm exerciser if it works.,"Its a good way to work your forearms, but it broke within 2 weeks. The gyro ball came off center."
2,Pain in the...... neck,This Dynaflex is the Worst thing to start...my husband used his drill to start it. Once it gets going you can feel that it works on your muscles etc. If you can keep it going! The other bummer is you really can't send it back. A waste of money.
2,Just a toy,"If you are looking for some entertainment, then this toy will also help you develop strong forearms. However if you are serious about exercising, then this toy will just frustrate you. It takes too long to get it going (like winding a yoyo) and to keep it going requires some skill. It is too easy to loose the rhythm and then you must restart it. For those that just want to concentrate on exercise this is too frustratingly complex. The only way to start it is with a special little string that is very easy to loose. I purchased this for my kids thinking that they would develop their arms for Little League. They were not strong enough or coordinated enough to keep it going and lost interest very quickly."
1,That's Enough,"After hearing this on the radio,i thought this was ok.But now it's on all the time.The song is really bad,and has gotten old already.Nine Days is the worst thing that ive heard since Sixpence none The Richer,but Macy Gray is the worst.Anyway,save your money,"
5,Just as good as the other books in the sereis of Alvin:,"GREAT! (that is) The whole serie of Alvin Maker is wonderfull, this might be one of the lesser good books in the serie, but it still totally wonderfull!"
4,Great storytelling,"Although this is arguably the best book in the series since the first one, the ending leaves you wanting more and yet still feeling satisfied. 4.5 stars."
2,The series is officially unsustainable at this point,"Wow, that went downhill quick. Alvin is no longer a vaguely interesting character in a well-drawn world, but a blatant Christ figure with nothing at all for the reader to relate to, a figure of such saccharine goodness that all obstacles just collapse at his approach. It's a shame Card felt it necessary to inflict this on people who enjoyed the first two books and put up with the next two.For good Christian allegory (if that's your cup of tea), get CS Lewis' Narnia books -- the story stands all by itself."
2,Incomprehensible and I am a fan!,"Incomprehensible. I am an absolute fan of Orson Scott Card, anything he writes I will pick up to read. But this book stopped me cold. Based on the premise of the book, knack's that are almost magical, I should have loved it. But the quality of the prose plummeted in this book. I just didn't' get it"
4,Nice Low Cost Alternative to Euro Tail Lights,"These tail lights look super without breaking the bank. Easy to install (use existing wiring and bulbs). The only downside so far is they fog up when it's damp outside so I fear moisture may be getting in somewhere. All in all a good value, just not great."
4,The Future of the Workforce Described for Policy Makers,"This book describes the future workforce to policy makers. It gives individuals making career decisions some objective, long-range data about the future. Projections include fastest-growing occupations, ethnic and age mix of the workforce, needs of employers, and income to be expected.As reviewed in Annotated Bibliography of Learning A Living, A Guide to Planning Your Career and Finding A Job for People with Learning Disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder, and Dyslexia by Dale S. Brown"
3,Fair quality for price,This product is fair quality for the price charged. It is very stiff and uncomfortable on the hands even with wearing gloves.
2,ehh....,"I only purchased this book for one specific monologue inside, that I thought was just funny enough. But If comedy is what your looking for, the other 221 monologes are a bit of a bore... but then again, we all know how hard it can be to find a really good one."
5,a delightful surprise,"I happened to hear this band while sitting in a bar with a couple of friends in Amsterdam during my vacation. Let me just say, we were all blown away and immediately asked the bartender who this band was. The music was amazing and the order of the tracks was perfect. My only regret was not buying the cd in the Netherlands for a cheaper price than for the import to the US."
1,False Advertising,"The description says leatherbound; the edition, of which I purchased two for newly baptized in our church, is bound in imitation leather. Please review the rite for the reconciliation of a penitent (p. 447) and contact me to arrange an appointment! Fr. John"
3,What has she done ?,"What has happened to Tepper ?. The idea is good but the moralising (despite agreement with many of the sentiments) is overkill. There has always been a feminist slant to many of Tepper's books but this is too much. Very disappointing as this is the only author for which I own and have read everything they have written. It almost makes me think ""The Family Tree' won't be worthwhile but then again one persisted after 'Beauty'. For Tepper at her best try 'The Gate to Womens Country', now that is outstanding writing."
1,Not so great,"I got this wax based on the reviews, but and completely dissatisfied with it. It is not easy to use and hurts so much on the face when pulling it off. I've only tried it on my face, but probably won't try it again since it was very difficult to use."
4,Yay (and Ouch) !,"This product definitely works. I used to use the Sally Hansen wax strips but will stay with the strip free wax as long as I can afford the product. The wax is definitely painful, my eyes water with each use. I have been doing my own waxing on myself for awhile now though so it is bearable, barely tolerable but bearable. The soothing oil provided with it is pretty decent and comes in a pretty color and bottle. The results last for quite awhile and are noticeable right away. I tend to have some minor irritation on my chin afterwards but that happens with a lot of products even though I generally do not have sensitive skin."
1,Stereotypes abound!,Loud Emily's parents think girls should have soft voices. They are very unaccepting of the nature of their child. Unbelievable ending.
2,"Not the best, not the worst",These strips were not as messy and did not leave behind as much residue as other wax strips. But they did not remove as much hair either. It says not to wash the skin before use so it seems if you have any oil on your skin they don't work. i was afraid to wash first because I figured there was a reason this product said not to-like you might be more likely to have a bad reaction.
4,About what you'd expect for the price,"It isn't a fine handmade bridge, so you shouldn't be expecting to improve the sound of your instrument at all. I'd say if you spent more than $800 on your instrument, you might want to think about spending more on a bridge. That said, I'm bought mine to replace a problematic bridge I had on a junker violin that I play in less formal settings. The item was carefully packaged, arrived in good condition and installed easily on the instrument. It's been on the instrument for about 4 months and I haven't observed any warping or other damage. It did the trick for me and I'm happy with my purchase."
5,I love this book.....,It is not a book that you have to read cover to cover in that order but a seasonal book that gives you ideas to incorporate into your own personal practice.
4,Last of the Mohicans,"Great piece of music, last album before junaid gave up music and turned the tides on opposite direction. Songs are melodious as they have always been but there length is increased which adds extra crisp to his numbers. Album starts with fast track but also has slow numbers but over all album is quite enjoyable and it wont keep your adrenaline level high all the time. A must for pakistani pop fan."
3,Space Rock?,How warped is Warp factor 9 of Aussies? I heard that there is a WF9 down in the US. They are supposedly alot better than this. Suck it.
5,Beautiful book,I am using this book to teach k to 3rd grades about geography. Not only is it very informative bit the illustrations are beautiful.
3,Mediocre,"David H. definately doesn't know what true music is.His words ""Oxygene 4 is not worthy of the album...""I say one thing, Oxygene 4 is why the rest of the songs exist!, try that you New Age Mind!"
5,Wonderful relaxing and moving,"I bought this CD when it first came out and at that time had never heard anything like it. I fell in love with the sounds, but mostly the way it made me feel. When I was having a stressful day I would listen to the CD. I would recommend this CD to everyone. I loved the ones that followed but I have to say this was the best of all."
5,Cheesy but good,"Let's face it: you feel kind of embarrassed buying a CD called ""Pure Moods."" It conjures visions of healing crystals and a full time therapist.But we all must admit that we like this silly CD.I mean come on:Orinoco Flow (Sail Away) - EnyaSadeness - EnigmaTheme From 'The Mission' - Ennio MorriconeSweet Lullaby - Deep ForestReturn To Innocence - EnigmaThese are great songs. Maybe they are a little cheesy, but be honest, you love them.Not all the Pure Moods CDs are worth buying, but this one is."
5,wow... even though i'm only 14 I loved this CD!,"Pure Moods is one of my favorite CD's. I'm so glad I used the gift certificate I got for my birthday on Pure Moods.... I listen almost every day to relax. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who likes soft and mysterious music should buy this CD. I love it and I'm sure you will too."
1,Non-Functioning,I received a non functioning product in a package that was clearly resealed. Lucky me.
4,keeps air in good,"I use this every summer, while I am fighting forest fires,, it is comphy ,fills quickly, and holds the air. all night.. The only neg. is that the pump is very noisy. so be carefull, setting up, late at night"
1,POS,"Like many other reviewers, I am very disappointed that the Coleman name is on this product. While we were without a guest bed, it was used very infrequently. Probably no more than 5 times in 9 months. Then it started losing air. I could not locate the leak so into the trash this goes. I wish they had a zero star category. This really deserves no stars. Don't buy this product."
1,A very bad backpack,"This backpack fell apart the first time out on a 5day hike, and the pack was about as comfortable as carrying a cinder block on your back. It would make a great daypack oh that wont work the pack is to large. Do not waste your money like I did."
4,Heart of Gold,"Let me start by saying I love J.R.Ward, the brotherhood novels are great. This is my forth Jessica Bird novel and it did not disappoint me either. You will not be wasting your time by reading her books!"
3,"It was just Okay, for me.","I just prefer her vampire books. It is almost like this isn't her writing these books. Probably not filled with big, hot , vampires and their ladies."
2,It just isn't good,"The writer and her subject matter are admirable, but a lot of the stories here, most of them in fact, are just not well written. The couple of pieces that do stand out are so much better than the book as a whole that one wonders how they managed to come out of the same imagination."
5,OOH LA LA!,"What can one say about some of the most beautiful ships that ever graced the ocean!The French Line prided itself on creating floating masterpieces and Mr. Miller's book captures some of the best pictures of these ladies! One can close one's eyes and imagine being on the deck of the Normandie or the Ile de France for a trip...Enjoy and bravo, Mr. Miller!"
2,Stinky Stillness,"I think December Stillness was way too sad and horrible. It also did not teach me a lesson, give me many emotions, or surprise me. None of the above- if it did do those things to me it would have been a great book. There was no point of it and i would never want to read another book like it! There was hardly a theme to it either."
5,pure energy 2 ... you should get this cd,"I like this CD a whole lot, I play it almost 3 times a week. Personally I got this CD for the track 'Running up that hill' (Alex Party Version) performed by Elastic Band which is extremely hard to find anywhere you look! I also like U96's Love see's no colour which is a good techno/alternative track. The Goodmen's Give It Up is also here but its the edited radio version. I also like More & More by the captain hollywood project which is also here, the bass is kinda heavy but it's pretty good. It also has other tracks known to many and played on your local dance station, but the ones mentioned above is the reason why I got it. I like it so much that I own 2 copies!"
4,A Classic!,"Some books, like wine, not only withstand the tests of time but are improved by it. I had read this book probably 20 years ago, but found it again when searching for a book on building chicken coops. I re-read it, and enjoyed it even more this time...I DO wish that the volunteers that make these books available to the public would take a few extra minutes and write a description instead of the generic ""this work was made available by...""If you love old movies that are filled with human emotion instead of car crashes and sex scenes and you like remembering (or dreaming of) the day when men were gentlemen and women were ladies, then you'll enjoy this as much as I did."
4,"Nice oversize catalog of Mesoamerican art and culture, with problems: 3.7 stars","This oversize coffee-table book has beautifully reproduced, well-chosen photographs, but significant drawbacks.Pluses:* Excellent photos of iconic objects* Good cross-section of prehispanic Mesoamerican artwork/artifacts* Nice feature articles on many major archaeological sites in Mexico, Guatemala and HondurasNeutral:* Average-quality text (translated from Italian)Negatives:* No decent overall map of the area* Maps of cultures are so general as to be almost uselessSo, this shouldn't be your only guide to prehispanic Mesoamerican history. But the high quality of the photos makes it worthwhile if you find an inexpensive copy. I haven't seen the recent B&N; reprint.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
1,a counterfeit,This was a heavily-inked counterfeit that gummed up the keys. I contacted the seller and he gave me a refund which was the right thing to do. I would buy from him again.
1,"Carry Case is CRAP! It is NOT Molded, it is nylon nothing.","The description for this ""deluxe"" set says it comes with molded carry case. This is NOT true. It comes with a worthless nylon carry bag that has no structure to it whatsoever. So, of course, all the horseshoes fall to one end in a big blob of metal, and you basically have a giant piece of worthless nylon bag with all the weight stuck in the bottom 25%."
5,This will be a classic,"I don't have children, but I enjoy a good quality cartoon and I find myself enjoying this movie. Pixar's animation captures expressions, realistice movement so well it's hard to not be impressed with their work."
5,love this movie,the movie is funny and can't wait to watch with my husband and son. My niece loves this move and glad it is on blue-ray
2,I can't rate it!,I had no knowledge of a regional code until I purchased this dvd. It had a regional code of 2 and we cannot play a 2 on any dvd player here in the US as the regional code should be a 1 or a 3. Please specify the regional codes when you are selling a dvd. Thank you!
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this product at Walmart for my son, and was quickly disappointed. When hung on the wall, it is extremely unstable, and a quick and solid yank on the cord could send it falling to the floor. As a table top lamp, it is very unsteady and the cord is an eyesore, unable to be discreet and tucked away. As a lamp in general, it is somewhat useless. Definitely not able to be used as a nightlight, since it continuously flashes, at a speed that I believe, could cause seizures if your child (or you) are prone to them. Not a joke. I have found it useful when my son doesn't think he is tired, I wrap him in a blanket, sit in a rocking chair, and face him toward the blinking light. Like the light on the tv, constantly changing, it does help him fall asleep if watching it for long enough.. but once he is asleep, the bright blinking lights have caused him to wake back up! Because there is no way to shut it off, except at the base.Don't buy it. It sucks."
1,yup gnats - lots of them....,"I bought this potting mix a few months ago and about a month ago I started seeing the gnats, which have been increasing daily. My plants are indoors so I was wondering where they came from. Yesterday I opened up the potting soil bag to repot a plant and found the inside of the bag crawling with the bugs. Maybe it was just a bad batch but I would suggest trying a different brand of potting mix to be sure."
3,"Good, but...","I've had this flashlight for about 6 months, and the central (and bright) white light has stopped working. I disassembled it and found a large amount of corrosion built up on the contacts for the white light - no idea where it came from as this flashlight has not been exposed to water. One other member of my unit reported the same problem with his. It could be a design flaw, be warned."
4,It's Stephen King - not an Académie Francaise publication,"Why do we read Stephen King, Constant Reader? So we can learn to cook like Anthony Bourdain? Maybe to scour each line for mistakes so that we can make the rank of sergeant in the grammar police before we retire? This novel was a pleasing and relatively rapid-paced return to the post-apocalyptic from an author that has ALREADY provided us with The Stand, The Dark Tower series, and just a few others I may have left out. We could wax philosophical about this novel's social implications, discuss King's true feelings about homosexuality and compare it to the ravings of a younger man. Or; we could pick up the book and enjoy. I did. You should, too."
1,Lacking depth or real interest...,"The first thing one notices about ""The Cell"" is that it feels as if Stephen King is out of touch with not just his readers, but, popular culture as a whole. The dialogue is jarringly unnatural. Stephen King is a master craftsman and writes well, but the characters lack depth and motivations for their behavior. It's as if the author decided he could and would write anything and people would buy it. He's right. We did, but we didn't like it.Upon finishing the book, you feel as if you turned off the television. There is no lasting impact or even a feeling of satisfaction. There was no difficulty, it was easy to read, but unsatisfying at the same time.I do not recommend this book to fans of Stephen King or anyone else. He's off his game or he just doesn't care... Either way, read something else."
2,King's style is the only redeeming factor...,"The storyline was preposterous, the antagonist was ridiculous, and yet King makes it all entertaining enough. If you find the book, feel free to read it. It's cotton candy for the brain.It does remind me of the scene in Forgetting Sara Marshall, where they deride Sara's choice in movie roles. ""How can your mobile phone kill you."" ""Take out the battery, DONE!"""
3,"Cell, Stephen King","It was an OK read, not a great read. In my opinion it does not deserve the top rating given by the Amazon editors who put it in the top ten list."
3,A good start...,"This has to tight, crisp pacing of some of the great classic King books...only the ending is letdown. The anticlimax deffinitely spoils a lot that came before."
3,Disappointing,"I think Stephen King is one of the greatest writers of our time but maybe he should call it a day. The plot is pretty much the same as ""The Stand"" which is a great novel but if I wanted to re-read it I would have. I'm going to read ""Lisey's Story"" eventually but if it's too similar to another one of his books it will be the last one I will read."
2,Disappointing.,"I expected more from Stephen King. I have been an avid reader of his books for over 25 years, and this has to be one of the weakest books he has written.This ""The Stand"" wanna-be is ill-paced and feels empty and pointless. Missing are the suspense and depth typical of King novels. Though the characters are likeable, a concept that is promising at first meanders into nothingness and to I-couldn't-care-less feeling.In the end, you get the feeling that nothing would be amiss had this novel never been written."
3,Front Heavy,"Almost instantly, this book grabs the readers attention, and it does not let go for a long time. The problem is that it does let go before the so-called ""climax."" It's as if King had this great idea, but he tired of it about half-way through. I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Cell,"" and it's all the more tragic because of how really interesting was the first half of the book.The first half of the book was, let's say four stars; the second half, two. That accounts for the three star rating and explains why I suggest something deeper in King's catalogue, something along the lines of The Shining or The Stand."
2,Is this the party to whom I am speaking?,"I've been a fan of Stephen King's books since I read _The Shining_ in the late 70's, but I stopped reading them after _Misery_. It seemed to me as if King had begun believing his own press, and his story seemed to lose the old edge of his masterpieces like _The Shining_ and _The Stand_. I listened to _Cell_ as a book-on-CD with the same fascination I used to feel with his older books until, near the end, when the story no longer seemed even remotely plausible and I realized that _Cell_ was just another shaggy dog story. If you like episodic tales that don't really go anywhere, _Cell_ may be to your liking, and it did cause me to think about just how pervasive cell phone technology has become. But in the end, it was just another long drawn-out story, and it'll probably be a long time before I feel drawn to read another of his books."
2,"Well, you can't win 'em all.","A few bright spots, but stilted characters, very few surprises, and gratuitous use of several eye-rollingly lame urban legends as fact (""you only use 2% of your brain"", you can blow up a fuel tank with a gunshot). My husband, a biologist and computer guy, was holding his sides and howling with laughter when I read out loud a few of the neurobiology/computer metaphor conversations.Love SK, but Cell is definitely not his finest work. A few stars for potential, if only it had been edited to hell and presented as a tight, terrifying novella."
2,Just plain dumb,"It started out great! Very tense and disturbing, but then took a familier turn about 60 pages in. Familier as in: Hey, I've read this before....In another King book!Yup, it is like a recycled The Stand, but really boring and goofy. The ""raggedy man"", the phoners and the thing with the boom boxes was just dumb. I used to love King, and consider his finest works to be The Shining, Salem's Lot, and Night Shift, but this was just horrible.Avoid unless you're a really hardcore fan."
4,Needs closure,"It was a good read, though the idea was not as new. I have seen better stuff from him. The thing that this novel was lacking the most was a closure. It felt like there should have been one last chapter to sum things up, but then maybe he is working on a sequel."
3,Left Hanging,I have liked some of Stephen King's books and hated others. This one landed somewhere in the middle. The book pulls you in and keeps you interested. It's definately a page turner. Somewhere near the end of the book it was as if Mr. King didn't know where to take the story so he just slapped an ending on it. The ending was stupid. For such a good story up to that point it was a tremendous letdown.
1,Constant Reader is (again) disappointed,"Unfortunately Stephen King disappoints again. ""Cell"" is a wordy, long-winding, empty and meaningless story. Page after page King drones on and bores his clientele. The end is absolutely NOTHING, as though his word processor had suddenly (and mercifully - for the reader) given out... I was a BIG fan of King, books like Misery and The Shining still belong to my all-time favorites, but this is exploiting his readers' fidelty for what it's worth."
1,Disappointed,"I am (or was) a huge Stephen King fan from the very beginning.(Salem's Lot and Carrie)I have read all of his novels and have been there in line at the book store on the first day. But this new book was a gigantic disappointment to me. The storyline is interesting, but its playing-out really reeked. King's characters are usually so well done that they are like someone I feel I know; however, the characters in this book are a little flat. Totally un-necessary use of multiple curse words. I am no prude, and I appreciate an occasional d--n, or f***, but just about every sentence issuing from the mouths of King's characters was foul. Even the 12 year old academy kid! The ending of the book was as if King just got tired of writing, and quit. Maybe he had something better to do. I can tell you that the next King book that comes out I will get from the public library and not purchase it myself."
2,Great Technical Writing But No Scares,"Levitating and Psychic zombies are the least of this book's problems. Forget the ridiculous premise of phone signals downloading instructions to the masses or the fact that a major plot point was written a number of years ago by author Brian Keene (going after a missing son in THE RISING), let's get down to brass tacks here -- it wasn't scary in the least!King falls back on his usual formula of gathering survivors together to battle the big baddie and then, of course, prevail so conveniently and in such a preposterous and illogical outcome, you have to ask yourself, ""Why is this a bestseller?"". Having the name Stephen King still sells books, but at some point, people will realize that the master of horror is now past his prime. Mr. King needs to go back and read his early work from the 1980's to remind him of why he was so great in the field of horror, and ultimately, how to scare the audience."
4,Cell phone hell,"Typical Stephen King creativity. What if a pulse hit all cell phones at the same time, wiping minds clean? Intriguing."
3,King keeps chugging.,"So a high publishing muck-a-muck at Scribner finally sees 28 DAYS LATER on DVD. He comes into the office the next day, tells an editor about it, and says, ""You know, I wish Stephen King had written something like that.""""Who says 'he' can't?"" says the editor. He rolls back the partition in his office wall to reveal the blinking lights on the Stephen-King-O-Matic 5000..."
4,Dont answer the phone!,"Stephen King's Cell kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. I found myself being up way to late on many nights until this book was fininshed. King has once again found a way to turn a common fear into a fantastic story. My only wish is that king would have (SPOILER ALERT!!) provided a little more closure to the end and told what happened to clay's son after the phone call, and whether or not they ever linked back up with the rest of the group."
5,Still great after all these years,One of Stephen Kings' best! Makes me not want to use my cell phone (don't think I used it at all while reading the book--good thing it only took a few days)
2,Unimpressed,"I have not read a Stephen King book in quite a few years, and did not regret my decision after completing Cell. I will admit, he is still at the top of his field as far as describing gore and mayhem, and the first hundred or so pages keep you very entertained. Then the novel begins to drag on into a series of predictable plot twists and increasingly ridiculous turns that leave you wanting the end to come as soon as possible. It drags on a bit long, it gives way too much credit to the intelligence of the characters involved (especially the younger ones, who seem to operate on a level even higher than the ""phone-crazies/people""). To sum up, though mildly entertaining at times, I was left quite unimpressed with King's latest work."
2,"""Cell"" equals ""The Stand""","I am a RABID King fan..however, while it has a great premise, CELL disappoints. It is THE STAND in the modern eraIt is exactly like ""THE STAND"". Instead of Captian Tripps, we have cell phones. Instead of The Dark Man, we have the Raggedy Man. In both books, you have the sharing of dreams and visions. In both books you also have characters named Tom.. In both books, you have the mass explosion that kills a bunch of people (set by Trashcan Man in STAND and Clay and Co in CELL.TOO MANY SIMILARITIES...SAVE YOU MONEY AND WAIT FOR THE MOVIE WHICH SHALL SURELY FOLLOW."
5,Stephen has done it again!,"I am a long time fan and this tome takes me back to the Stand, although it is much shorter. Lots of thrills and chills and makes one think about our use of technology. Hurrah for Stephen!"
3,Felt like I'd read it before...,"I like some of Stephen King's books but this one was a little bit too samey for me, I really believe that somewhere along the line I had heard this story before, I'm not saying it's copied but the idea has been there before. Overall it was a good story and good characterization as always but just not up there with the best of them."
3,Easy-to-read thriller that falls a little short.,"Like all other Stephen King books, this one was easy to read and follow. Overall, I enjoyed the story and the idea of terrorists making use of an everyday item that is ubiquitous is interesting and thought-provoking, albeit a tad unrealistic. However, unlike the other Stephen King books I've read, this one is rather open-ended. In the end, no real explanation was given as to who, how and why things happened. Other readers may not find this necessary but I thought it would be more interesting. In this sense, I find ""The Cell"" to be not ""fleshed out"" sufficiently. Still, it is a must-read for any Stephen King fans. It's a thrilling read and the premise of the story is more frightening than his usual horror stories because it might and could happen in real life."
1,I Gave Up,"I agree that the first 75 pages of this book made me think this was going to be a great read. Boy was I wrong!King just mosies along, throwing into this story everything but what we most wanted: Horror.The ""phoners"" were lame - even comical. The interaction between the characters was ridiculous and stereotyped.I stopped reading this mess right after the Clay and co. left the boarding school."
2,"""it"" it's not!","i bought the book the week it appeared - don't know why i still do this, i have not read more than 150 pages of insomnia, but i keep buying every book except for the dark tower set, and have been disappointed with each of them. i am currently listening to cell on audiobook, which makes it easier to interact with the book while tending to the garden or walking max.king's first books were superb. he was able to make the reader identify with the book characters and by the time the plot thickened we cared about what happened to ous protagonists, and their reactions were always in sync with what we knew about them. after 3hours 20 min (out of 12 1/2) i do not yet care about clay, tom or alice.as an inveterate hater of cell phones (i commute to nyc and back home by bus, and have been battling with loud, rude, obnoxious users for more than a decade now), i do love the premise of the book. i hope that i start caring about someone in it soon."
4,I LIKED the ending!,"I thought this was a typical King book: good story, good characters (well, maybe we didn't learn as much about anyone or as many people) and well developed to make it a page turner. I love books that feature bands of people or individuals travelling cross country in an apocalyptic setting and this is what we get. I think a lot of readers are disappointed with the book because things didn't happen just the way they thought they should, but tell yourself ""things don't always go the way you want them to. Good people die, plans go bad, the incoceivable happens from time to time, coincidences also happen. AND we don't always know all the details."" The ending left it up in the air for us to decide what happened. I liked that!"
2,It's almost hard to believe the writer is Stephen King,"This books starts out ok, but goes downhill fast. I have a theory about why that is. The start of the book is all action. When the action tapers off, the character development takes over. It's at that point I had to check the cover to see if I had the right author? The characters never develop beyond cardboard cutouts. The dialogue, usually a King strong point, just doesn't ring true. Has anyone also noticed King resorts to corny sentiment in place of character development thesedays. The prose in some parts is mind-numbingly bad as well. I have read a lot of King books, and even though the story sometimes fails to deliver, the writing never does. This book will be marked down as an aberration by true king fans(not the mindless ones who have given it 5 stars here)."
2,"No ending, but good reading...","Cell is like most of S. King's other books, little about what happens is explained and the story just stops, there is no ending. It is like someone removed the last chapter from the book. You are left wondering about the ending and the entire story, but I suspect that is part of the point. But, the story is pretty good and it does keep you interested, it is not easy to put down. Maybe there will be a Cell 2, and he will explain things and finish the story....."
2,SLOW GOING and FRUSTRATING. BELOW AVERAGE.,"A pulse over the Cell phone transforms the half world into crazy people (NOT ZOMBIES). After that, the main character tries to get home and find his kid with the help of two more people.The book isn't bad.The problem is that, after a great 50 pages start, we get 300 more pages of a slowgoing story devoided of any great storytelling. Mainly we get vivid descriptions and lots and lots and LOTS of dialogue. LOTS of it. You can even scroll down entire pages without missing anything really important for the story.And many of the elements here (like the telepathy thing) does not really fit into this. I found it boring and hard to believe.Mr. King gave us great books in the past. But in this one is quite out of his environment.And the endind... big disappointment. I felt like the author did not knew how to end the story and decided to ""do not finish it"".No, I did not like it too much."
3,World ban on cell phone use?,Think about what your cell phone could be used for (Big Brother Watching?) Put your own twist on this and rewrite your own ending. You may enjoy it more than I did but have my doubts.
2,Not nearly up to the quality of his other recent work,"I LOVE Stephen King's writing, so I say this from a place of deep respect... ""Not your best, Steve."" With recent fantastic novels like ""Under The Dome,"" ""Bag of Bones"" and ""11/22/63,"" King has proven that his writing has matured and that he still has a deep well of stories to pull from. This one, however, disappointed me. It seemed a bit pat, not enough detail or clarity, and just generally not as gripping or interesting as so many of his others.I will continue to read his work, but if you are a first-time King reader, you can give this one a miss for now."
4,Good Book,The book started off as a real page turner and slowed down a bit but I would reccomend it to anyone. Makes you think about how reliant we are on our technology and how things can go bad quick when we don't have it. Its a different approach on the zombie craze everyone is in.
4,King's twisted take on the zombie genre!,"One thing I have always liked about Stephen King's work is that it almost always makes you think. That is really the case here, as he takes a tired genre and gives it a modern twist and a even more meta angle. I enjoyed the character work here as everyone we meet is fleshed out. There were slow parts of the book but they fit in the story. It wasn't super action filled but atmospherically creepy. Overall, a very solid read.....again."
1,Should Have Stayed Bachman,"In his typical fashion, Stephen King leads us to believe in the first few paragraphs that he may have finally returned to the voice that we all fell in love with. Sadly, this is not the case.""Cell"" is as badly contrived a novel as I could have ever imagined. One-dimensional characters, a farcical style and voice, his ever-present use of slang words for anatomy, and his creepy penchant for including teenaged girls in his stories. King's use of street-level geography bogs down the reader, making us concentrate more on where his characters are physically rather than where they are emotionally. Anyone unfamiliar with Massachusetts is apt to put down the tome in a few minutes, once they get past the macabre opening scenes in which people jump from skyscrapers and gnash at each others' throats with their teeth.Unfortunately, the days of the King are gone, leaving us all wishing for Bachman in all his glory."
2,"Too much like ""The Stand"" in plot and characters!","I liked the book (didn't LOVE it, like I did ""The Stand""), but it is not something I would read again as I have some of his other books. Speaking of ""The Stand"", this book was, to me, just an updated version of that same plot. Population dwindles (The Pulse replaces Captain Tripps), those left are ""good versus evil"", and we even have the Harvard Man taking the place of Randall Flagg! Too many similarities for me. I wanted to read a new plot, with new twists, and not just an updated version of something that he already wrote; albeit, many years ago. The initial premise was good, but the development of the story was like déjà vu to anyone who has read ""The Stand"". Come on, Mr. King, aren't there enough NEW scary things out there for you write about!?"
1,same old garbage,"This book is total garbage and has no redeeming literary qualities whatsoever. And, ironically, I enjoyed reading ""The Stand"" and the enormous sweep of that book and quirky characters King created. ""Cell"" doesn't even come close to it and seems highly contrived. King seems to rehash the same old gorey themes and makes no attempt to achieve any literary standards, as if he's capable of that.I couldn't finish the damn thing, it was so twisted and convoluted. And I hate cell phones as bad as King."
1,King should have quit while he was ahead,"What a really awful book. Stephen King has definitely gone down hill in his writing skills as he had gotten older. He said a couple times that he was going to quit writing and he certainly should have before writing this book. The story starts with an interesting scenario, cell phones wipe human brains clean (like a hard drive), but then he doesn't know where to take it from there. It becomes totally convoluted and silly (stupid actually) after a while. I forced myself to finish the book, but I couldn't help but skim the last couple hundred pages. I highly recommend readers avoid anything written by Stephen King in the past ten or fifteen years. Certainty avoid this monstrosity."
3,Better than The Road,"I thought it was pretty good. Not life altering but it kept me reading to see what was going to happen. It reminded me a little of The Road by Cormac McCarthy except unlike that book, I wasn't depressed for a week afterward. I like how the behavior of the ""Phoners"" became flock-like and how the program became corrupt.I even like the ending being cut short like that. I real life, things don't get wrapped up in act three.I noticed a lot of the single star reviews mention that the characters were two dimensional. At what point does a character become three dimensional? I mean the character of Clay seemed to have been fleshed out pretty well."
2,Disappointing,"As with many readers, I got to the end of The Cell, and couldn't believe that there were no more pages to turn. I don't feel that another 200 pages were necessary, and some loose ends are fine by me, but another chapter would have gone a long way towards satisfying me. Normally I am able to finish a book like The Cell within two days - this took me over a week. It was very easy to put down and come back to an entire day later. I love (most) King novels, and sadly, this didn't do it for me. The Stand, Bag of Bones, Needful Things and Insomnia will always be my favorites."
2,Big Letdown,"This book is was well written like all of King's work (the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1), but has a weak premise and an even worse ending. ""Cell"" relies too heavily on the ""Night of the Living Dead"" franchise, and the old theme of ""modern technology is evil"" to be original.The explanations in the book for the phenomenon called The Pulse, how it began, and for the actions (and evolution) of the people who are affected are so unbelievable that whole story falls flat. Outside of the main characters' need to survive, there's literally no reason for any of the events that occur in this book. Character development is almost non-existent (which might be a first for King).The writing is good enough to keep you entertained for awhile, but in the end, ""Cell"" is forgettable. If you haven't read Stephen King before, don't start with this book. Try ""The Stand"", ""Salem's Lot"", or ""The Shining"".Mr. King is my favorite fiction writer, but maybe it IS time for him to retire."
5,Excellent,"I can't really describe it, it was unlike anything i have ever read. This book starts off with a bang, and it's one of those that you just can't put down. I am never really a big fan of reading, but this book just had me hooked. If you like the post appocalyptic type books that make you think, then this is the one for you."
2,I think I'm missing a few chapters!!! If someone finds them.......,"I think I'm missing a few chapters!!!Help please.....I think Steven King got this story mixed up with ""The Stand"" and then forgot to give the publisher the last couple chapters. If anyone finds them, please send them to me.Really, the book was great but the ending sucked. What happened? It seems like King was sitting in his cabin writing this novel and couldn't think of a good ending so he thought, ""Well I'm Steven King and the publisher will print anything I send to them anyways""."
3,Avg. Book Will make a great Movie.,"Quick read, but King has a theme that run through out his books that is predictable (If You have read all his books), but I still love to read the way he turns a tale and can't wait to see this on film."
2,What!!?,"One reviewer said.""I have read many King books and found this to be one of his best.""And i said.""What!!?"""
5,King does it again!,From page one I was hooked and didn't put it down until I finished it. It had the elements of The Stand in it but different altogether. A great book that I am glad that I own and don't have to take back to the library!
3,Promising Premise,"Cell is a good story, told by a master storyteller. The book almost feels like an outline to a story that could've been much bigger. The ending is extremely abrupt and not satisfying at all, and King presents many interesting events that beg for some kind of explanation, but in the end there isn't one (just one example--what exactly was the guy in the red sweater?)."
3,Starts out great then sputters to a halt.,"They way the story started I had high hopes that it would be a great read, but it went downhill FAST.It's like he ran out of an idea of what he wanted to do and just wrapped up the whole story about 200 pages short, which is a rarity for Stephen King.Overall it was not BAD and it was not real enjoyable, but it was readable."
1,just terrible,"this book was bad from the start. he gives way too many details about unimportant things, and not nearly enough info on the stuff we all wanted to know. there were countless times when you'd read a paragraph and think, ""wow, that doesn't add to the story at all.""almost every time someone says something, he follows it up with 2-3 sentences that pretty much amount to: ""he thought about saying this, but then he thought better of it.""if you take out everything in this book that is pointless and adds nothing to the story, you'd lose about 100 pages. and you still would have to add another 100 to include the info that is never answered in the book. for a man that has been widely criticized for being long-winded, it's surprising he doesn't include answers to the mysteries in the book. it's a short and yet, long-winded novel.i woudln't recommend it to anyone."
2,Disappointing,"I started off enjoying this book, but by the end was truly disappointed. I felt the ending was a let-down and not very well planned or thought out."
3,Not the best King book,"For most of this book, it is worth two stars probably. However, i did bump it up to three stars because i really enjoyed the first 50 pages of the book. Chaos is happening, noone knows what's going on, people are going crazy. The rest of the book is OK at best, it kinda reminds of a generic version of the stand with zombies in it. It just moved slow after the beggining, and even though i couldn't wait to finish this book....the ending left me feeling kinda cheated. Some people may love this book, but i did not."
1,Lots of Plugs,"If you enjoy reading novels that plug lots of products and brand names, you will love this novel. The following products and brand names were plugged in this novel: Nike, Saran Wrap, Nextel, Coleman, Four Seasons Hotel, Dilly Bar, Panasonic, Visa, Batman, Cessna, Denny's, Dodge Ram, Texaco, Safeway, Breyers, IGA, Coke, HBO, CNN, Burgar King, Reebok, Citgo, Pepsi-Cola, Junior Mints, Sears, Subaru, Saturn, Cadillac, MG, Chevrolet, Google, Joe Boxers, Motorola, Slurpee, 7-11, Corvette, Twinkies, Altoids, and Doritos. (Not to mention: At least 15 major label recording artists were plugged.)Coleman received the most plugs (I counted 16).Nike was plugged at least 9 times. In my eyes, all these plugs cheapen the novel. I am curious to know how much money SK brought in through these plugs. And does he feel that it was worth it?"
4,i liked it but didnt like it,its nice to have atleast one questioned answered when reading a book that leaves you asking them. apparently stephen kind does not think so. i loved this book. it drew me in and kept me hooked. and then i got to the last page and wanted to throw the book at the wall( but couldnt because it was a library book.) the thing just ended with no resolution at all except he found his kid. whoopdee doo. how about how it all happended? or was it all over? well thats all i have to say. i love how detailed he is but he needs to sum things up better in this one.
3,I've read better SK,"I looked forward to receiving my copy of Cell for some time and dived in the day it was released. After reading, I'd have to say that I was, like many here, somewhat disappointed. The book is good, but it just doesn't grab the reader. I definitely would not recommend this to first time Stephen King readers, as he has much much better stuff out there."
4,Interesting twist on the whole zombie thing,"We all know that cellphone technology develops at an alarmingly fast rate, so when you read this book, keep in mind cellphones from the early 2000's.This book could make a good movie with a little updating!These aren't zombies like you've ever seen before... they aren't even dead! They're called ""Phone crazies"", but I cant say much more without spoiling it for you.This is yet another disturbing vision from the modern master of macabre.I wouldn't say that it's his best writing per-se, but I can say that this book contains one of his most disturbingly realistic premises!A great read for any King fan or anyone who is leery of cellphones!!!!"
3,Could the Master Be Slipping,"Like many, I was rather disapointed with this King novel. The action is full-bore before the reader has a chance to even remotely get to know the characters. It is as if King was impatient and not willing to fully develop his story.As the ""journey"" portion of the story began to develop I was immediatly reminded of King's earlier (and superior, I think) work, ""The Stand."" We have essentially the same formula here. Two groups of people, one good and the other bad. Both groups being drawn to an area. The bad group is destroyed by the good group in the very heart of the their meeting place. the tool used to destroy them is the same tool that has been used to hurt the good folks. ""The Stand"" was about a virus, ""Cell"" is about a virus albeit an electrical one.Like others, I was hoping to learn more about the pulse and what happened to those who propagated it. Why did they do it? What were they hoping to accomplish? What happened to them?This book could have been far better."
1,That's how it ends???,"The overall plot of the story is interesting, however the ending of this story makes the entire book not worth reading. I understand authors sometimes like to have the reader use their imagination on the ending outcome.... but the way King ends this book left me annoyed. I finished the book feeling as if I wasted my time with this book."
2,A lot written that made no sense!!!,"There is no question King has written some great books in the past, but this one is one of his worst. Not only was it boring, it just didn't do anything to keep you glued to the story. It was a struggle to get through it.Not a book I would recommend to read."
2,Gamera,this dvd had very poor visual and auditory quality. I would not purchase again. It would be great if there was a preview offered that shows a short clip of any movie.
5,IF YOU WANT ALL OF THE ORIGINALS,"IF YOU WANT ALL OF THE ORIGINAL SHOWA ERA GAMERAS UNCUT WITH ENGLISH SUBS THEN GO TO MONSTERS IN MOTION AND SEARCH GAMERA, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED, THEY ARE AMAZING IN THEIR ORIGINAL FORM."
4,A good Introductory Book,"This book is a good starter book; much better than Oracle Materials. It gives good Introduction to Oracle Modules GL,AR and AP with the help of screen shots. (in fact, lots of screen shots help the understanding).Though the contents are not for an advanced user (who would use Oracle User guide then) but still for a person who has not seen Oracle Financial Applications at all, it would be a good first step.I did not rate 5 star because1. it did not cover 2 financial modules : Fixed Assets and Cash Management2. A chapter on what is happening behind the screen in applications (like general concept of Oracle Tables, TRMs etc. would have helped.3. Should have included as an appendix: Additional Sources of Information like Metalink, OTN web etc."
1,Too Big,"The watch seemed to meet my requirements: second hand, ladies' watch, easy to read numbers. But, when it arrived, it was HUGE! The face literally went from one side of my wrist to the other. I looked back at the description and didn't see any sizing information. I returned it."
5,Very pleased,"I purchased this air mattress for future camping trips. Soon after receiving it I pumped it up and slept on it for a night to test it out. I loved it! Everything about it was just as advertised. Really liked the bed-like feeling of being up off the ground. With just a little tweaking to the air level, I slept with great comfort."
5,Great value,Quickbed with Electric pump was easy to inflate and a perfect solution for extra company during the holidays. Great value too!
1,"Over-cooked, over-done, over-rated","This is my first crockpot so I tended to blame myself for most everything being ruined. Maybe one out of five times the recipe turned out, but that was because it was a soup or stew that was mainly water. The other four times out of five the food would be cooked-to-death. Only after researching this model on the web did I realize that the flaw was with the cooker, not me. The stay-warm mode, which automatically comes on after the timer times-out is way, way too hot on this model. In reality it continues to cook your meal at a high temperature, further ruining it in the process. After wasting a lot of money on ingredients I am saying good-bye to this clunker and getting another model."
1,What a crock!,"Don't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so-called ""slow cooker."" Just like most people have reported, the unit runs VERY HOT! This is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control. After a couple of burnt meals, I went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch. Unfortunately, I had thrown away the carton and receipt so I couldn't return it. As a result of this experience and wasting my good money, I will avoid buying Rival products in the future."
1,Waste of space and money,"While its pretty on the outside, this ""slow"" cooker completely burned everything I put inside it on 2 different occasions. Both recipes (one was for chicken, one was for beef) said 10 hours on low. I even added extra liquid just to be safe. By 6 hours on low, both meals were burnt to a crisp. This cooker would be great if you were home to keep an eye on it, but if you want it to truly slow cook your meal, look for the older version that your mom used to have."
1,Wish I had another slow cooker...,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2005. I was thrilled to get it since I had an older, smaller model. I had never burned any food in a slow cooker before I used this model. I couldn't figure out how to get it to cook SLOWLY. I finally called customer service and was told I wasn't using the right kinds of recipes. She told me that the pot had to be at least 75% full. I used her advice, but it still boils everything on every temperature level. I use it to make roasts and that is all. It ""sweats"" horribly and I have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn't burn my countertop. The handle cracked after 6 months. My biggest ""ah-ha"" moment was when I came home after a long day out. There had been a power surge, and it had reset itself. My whole meal was ruined and that is when I realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker. Just back away slowly from this one!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,I wanted to like this crockpot. It is very nice to look at but that's about it. I follow the recipe directions and time settings only to come home after work to find the charred remains of what was to be a delicious meal. This happened twice and I don't want to ruin any more food! I have never had this problem with either of my previous crockpots. This will be returned ASAP!
1,Amazon should not sell this appliance!,Dito on everything said in all the other reviews. This slow cooker is a flame thrower and you are better off burning the $$ rather than spending it on this. It would give you greater satisfaction than charring the many tasty meals you hope to create with it. Regal should be ashamed to sell such a piece of JUNK...
1,ILP makes more money...,"While the poetry in this anthology deserves note, the ILP (International Library of Poetry) is exploitative and preys on the novice/unpublished poet. They achieve this rather neatly by promising to publish almost anyone (those deserving and those not) just to secure 'pre-booked' orders for their works. Even at that, if one wants to be 'published', ILP will do it for you; however, be careful of what you do or purchase from them. They are certainly 'for-profit' and think little of the authors that place faith in them. I can't deny that some of the work is very good...but I can say I wouldn't fund them with a dime. If you have it, enjoy it...if not, do not justify them with your $'s. I am published in a few of their anthologies but, I would never suggest someone purchase one! My apologies to the substantial artists in their texts."
3,okay product,"Made in India. So-so quality, somewhere between dollar store tool and Craftsman. Worth about what they are selling for ($3.50) and no more."
3,5 stars for the bonus disc!,"Forget the actual CD. It's a touch better than Slug's newer releases, but it's basically his typical slightly girly type of rapping with half decent beats.BUT, the bonus CD you get with this features some early matieral from slug,musab and others which is extremely good. The bonus disc has some very raw beats and aggresive rhyming which sounds like it could have been an east coast album. (I can't believe I'm saying something positive about Slug)I don't know what happened to slug, but I can tell you that he USED to be a good rapper. I suppose the whole backpack movement diluted his character. Like I said, the 2nd disc is nothing like new atmosphere, it's real hip-hop. Believe it or not!"
3,Better than the WinFrame course student manual but ...,"Sure, this book was better, much better, than the coursebook but: (1) it would have been easier to digest if its contents were more organized, and (2) it had fewer typos. Still, and criticism aside, this book filled in an essential void in configuring and managing WinFrame installations."
5,A definite must have!,"It should be a personal procession of every Winframe Admin. The book is full of tips and how to do's. A winner with entry level and even advance level Wi nframe Administrator. One source for information. No need to go to the web for info, It's all in the book.. Peter's & Associates Inc. should be proud to have a knowledgeable person on their staff. Looking forward for the next revision."
3,Doesn't charge iPhone or iPod if PC Off!,"Targus KB article makes it very clear: [...]. If you try to charge most phones or Apple products with your PC off or suspended, charging will not take place because these items require a constant USB signal. So don't buy this thinking you can suspend or shut off your PC and have a charged phone in the morning!"
2,Not a true crime account...,"This book was very disappointing in that not only was it not typical ""catch the killer"" narrative that most true crime accounts are. It was hard to read and included too many impressions of the author."
4,Great Strobe,"I bought this strobe light to be a part of my Halloween decorations. This strobe is a little bit over kill for a simple house out side decoration enhancer, but the bigger the better... I had this strobe set up on my front porch because it can not get wet from the weather. I would of gave it 5 stars, but not being water proof I gave it 4. Being on my front porch, the strobe did put out the light needed and then some to high light my decorations. On Halloween night I had to move the strobe off my front porch so it didn't blind the kids coming for candy. The weather didn't call for rain so I set it up in the middle of my front yard. WOW did it put on a show. This strobe lit up a 2 story house with no problems including both side neighbors houses. So to be a good neighbor I moved the strobe closer to my house, I didn't want the neighbors to get mad...We has a LOT of compliments and admirers walking by."
4,All About Snobbery,"This novel would be enjoyed most by men who enjoy sex and golf, but wives need to read it to avoid being easily duped by straying husbands. On a deeper level, it serves as a social commentary on snobbery and the rat race in which many modern workers find themselves trapped, especially those in sales. A worthwhile and hilarious read."
3,Mindtickler lite,"The narration of a crime/mystery scenario was not among Asimov's strongest virtues. I haven't come across another Asimov novel with the same theme, so I'm certain that Asimov realized his limitations in this particular field."
4,"Amazing Sound, Beautiful Looks","These are really nice cymbals, to say the least. They actually have a slightly heavier sound than I'm used to, but not really a big deal. You have to be careful with your washes, though, because the hammered ridges in the bottom cymbal make it very easy to have too open a sound for your washes."
3,BMW Z3 Bentley Manual Review,"good resource but lacks some vital information that you might not relize until it's too late, and you've already screwed something up."
3,1997 Z3 Repairs,"This book is better than any I have purchased before; however, it still is not as complete and detailed as a service manual needs to be. (This means that the ones I purchased before were really bad - like the ones you can get at AutoZone and comparable auto parts stores.) This book is missing a lot of the small details required to work on the car effectively, and easily. I went to the BMW dealership and, since they don't sell a service manual for the car, they recommended this book as the best that is available. I'm afraid that this is the best manual I'm going to be able to find.To Z3 owners wanting to work on your car --- Good Luck!"
3,"Good, but could be better","A nice book with goog ilistrations. What's keeping this from being great? The table of contents and index contain very little about the interior. Nothing about the console other than how to remove it. It mentions a glove box light bulb wattage, but then mentions nor shows anything else about it. Z3's don't have glovebox lights.The book seems to have been written by the same people who wrote the Z3 owners manual. The big things are covered, but many small details are missing.Better than nothing, but leaves me wanting."
5,Keep Dancin'.....,"This si an awesome CD from an awesome new band. The original single is still the best one, but the mixes are also very hot. The Linslee Campbell mix is pretty good, but the Groove Chronicles mix is much better. The only bad thing about the mixes are that they are just not long enough. They leave you wanting more! Also, the CD rom video is a great added bonus! It's a great video from a great new band who will hopefully keep us dancin'!!....."
4,Interesting read,I will be heading out as a dog handler on my first yukon quest in a few weeks and decided to read this book. I enjoyed the look at it from the outlook of someone outside the race itself. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the sport or not. It's a good read and reinforces the connections between the dogs and the musher.
1,cheap,"I wasn't expecting anything heavy duty, but this won't even stick to the wall. There are 4 pieces of small double side tape (thin, barely tacky)to attach this to a corner wall. Considering this probably costs 20 cents to make, they could have put some decent sticky tape. Bottom line is I have to purchase something else, to make this product work which is poor quality control."
4,Kitty Komber,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my friends. The cats love them, especially the catnap."
2,a poorly designed product,the groom 'n comb is not put together well at all.i had to tape it in a lot of places to get it tostay together and to attach to the wall.i would certainly not recommend it.
1,Waste of money,Product wouldn't stick to the wall and comb kept falling apart. My cats love getting their hair combed and I was really bummed when this product didnt work.
3,Sorry to break up the lovefest,"Although I can see how many people, through their own frustrations, would find this book appealing,I do not join the chorus of cheerleaders. Yes this is a funny book in a dark and sick way but I cringed as much as I laughed.In the husbands desire to defeat the wife, doesnt he become as bad as she? Doesnt HE admit to giving false information on a restraining order? Doesnt HE work the system to suit his needs? Doesnt HE really need a ""checkup from the neckup"" to use his own words? Im not saying dont buy the book- I think that the part about the children being called out of class to collect free meal coupons was worth the 8 bucks- but I am saying dont become manipulated into feeling sorry for the guy when we all know that men always come out on top in divorce."
1,I'm assuming I'll still get paid if I say the book stinks?,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Reply to: job-122604154@craigslist.orgDate: 2006-01-04, 2:41PM ESTneed people to write reviews of my bookthe book is called the dakapa handbook and i need reviews to be submitted to newspapers as well as reviews on amazon. you can read the first chapter on amazon and if you are interested i will send you the book. thank you !Job location is nj"
3,The Dakapa Handbook was...,"...very funny. I loved all the sarcasm and it certainly kept me entertained. I read it in a few hours which is good since I very quickly dismiss things that don't capture my attention immediately. I must admit that at times, I wanted to scream ""Enough already! We get the point...Iliana is a horrid monster...you're depressing me!"" But then again, I couldn't stop reading so I'm glad this book made me 'feel' and react.Very entertaining but definitely ended too soon. The climp upwards was slow and steady but the descent was way too fast."
5,Delightful,"Really a wonderful volume. As a fanatic collector of floorplans of British architecture, country houses in particular, this book is invaluable to me. Even the unwieldy Knole House in Kent is tackled with skill and pathos, represented in block plan that nonetheless illustrates the design and extant plan of this bear of a mansion (its legendary 365 rooms can only be guessed at, but this helps to peel away a little of the mystique). Not only are the buildings beautifully represented in color illustrations and reasonably detailed plans of multiple stories, but the narrative descriptions of the architecture and the social history of these great buildings is written in fine and engaging prose. I commend the author and offer full marks to anyone interested in some of the finest representations of English country house architecture."
1,Quality Problems,"I read a very positive review of this book in the newspaper, so I bought it for my granddaughter. The idea is good, but we are very disappointed in the quality of the book. There are various tabs to pull and a child can't pull them. One page can't even be pulled by an adult. Made sturdier, I think it could be a useful book."
3,"poor, poor packaging....","Box arrived battered and torn. The hardware bag had ripped open and most hardware was missing. Assembly of approx 12 bolts required a torque wrench. Amazon couldn't replace the hardware pack, but offered to ship a new item or gve me a $40 refund."
3,Great product - but may close for all bumpers,"the product is solid and straight forward to put together.however, i can not close/raise the cargo carrier b/c it hits my bumper. i drive a '03 tahoe so my car and my bumper are rather popular items. the picture shown may be a bit misleading. there are extensions i can buy so no big deal, but it would have been nice had i known it did not fit all makes and models out of the box. overall, happy with purchase."
4,Excellent Carrier,"We have an Expedition but did not want to use the back area for storing our luggage. I have previously used a roof rack for our luggage on road trips but this causes a decrease in fuel economy. I selected this carrier because it folds up and appeared very sturdy. We have now used it on a 3,000 mile round trip and it held up very well and we experienced no side effects from the rack extending in the back. If you have a full size SUV, highly recommend that you get the model that folds up so that you do not have to remove the rack in limited parking areas. This is a definate buy for taking road trips."
2,"Great pictures, but for kids?","The book is adorable, but I found the drawings of the people in various undergarments (or none at all) on to be a little too much to give to my 5-year-old nephew."
4,Decent book,"This book cover pretty much all the materials for any probability class in a organized way. Some of the concept seem rushed, but overall, it is a decent review book"
4,Mildred Walker is simply one of the best authors ever...,"Mildred Walker wins my heart again with her story, ""A Piece of the World."" While my favorite is ""Winter Wheat"", this book stirs the heart. I want to reach in there and solve all the problems that are going on in the story, but alas, I cannot, so I eagerly turn the pages to see how Mildred Walker spins the story and am satisfied with the results. I am going to order more of her books and absorb myself in them."
5,Great,"Not just useful but entertaining. I got this book in exasperation when I couldn't make sense of Peter O'Toole's autobiography, because of all the English slang. This dictionary saved the day."
2,Mean spirited and self righteous,"This author takes every opportunity to take The Great One down a few pegs. Even when begrudgingly admitting Gleason's strong points (such as his generosity and support of civil rights), there is an underlying tone of judgement throughout the book.Also, I kept waiting for the ""Honeymooners"" period to be discussed, but this entire period seems glossed over. No anecdotes, no behind the scenes tales...It seems the author just wasn't privy to much information and instead composed a smear campaign of a dead man. A shame."
1,Bad edition.,"I don't know if the movie is any good, as I wasn't able to watch it. Or, to be precise, to hear it. The movie soundtrack is DTS only, while Dolby Digital is used for the commentaries only (in Korean, with no subtitles). This should be warned in the product description."
5,Excellent Service & Product,Very good service; I would buy from this seller again & would recommend them without hesitation.
5,Books as Art / Art as Books An incredibly unique product!,"This has got to be my favorite One Page Book. This centerpiece is stunning! The colors are brilliant, and the content is truly cativating. I would venture to say that this piece is the crown jewel of the One Page Books collection. Plus, the text is guaranteed to be complete and unabridged. Perfectly suited for reference. This is a classy, beautifully produced piece of art and literature combined."
1,So far from the truth,"I only read the first eighty pages, but that was eighty too many. I have never read anything so far from the truth. I want to warn anyone thinking of reading this book that they should pick up a bible instead. As interesting as this book sounds, it twists the very basic truths of Christianity and waters down the real facts about our spirituality. Nothing in life can compare or replace true salvation in Jesus Christ. A life lived for Jesus is the most fulfilling thing one can do. Everything else is empty. Please consider God's true and living word instead, pray, and ask him to show you the truth."
5,FWG has note of authenticity,"I do not know if FWG was actually written through a dialogue with God. However, it has all the earmarks of such a dialogue. It is original, insightful, relevant, inspirational and highly accurate in its portrayal of human motives and emotions, and of the consequences of our everyday madness. This is a rare achievement in my experience. I recommend the book for the Seekers of the world, and those who are fascinated by new ideas on spiritual psychology."
2,White said it best -- Omit unnecessary words,"The author has some good thoughts to communicate -- none of them original. But, he uses so many words to do it. And, he repeats them. And repeats them. And repeats them. Ad nauseam.Furthermore, he presents a smug God. I find that very unappealing!He is one of the most self-serving writers I have read in awhile. Reading this guy is like reading ""a fine Hearst publication.""Did the publisher employ an editor to review the work before printing? There are numerous grammatical errors.What he says is not new. Others have said it much better. Notably, Wayne Muller, in ""Legacy of the Heart,"" deals with many of the same issues and other important ones. However, Muller writes with respect for the reader, no interest in self-promotion and with a good purpose for the use of the profits from the sale of his works.Friednship with God is not a new concept. It does not require a semantic battle to sell it.It only requires faith."
1,Hopeless product,It took 20-mins for the first time to fill air inthe bed.In 2-weeks the seal between two layers gone and I am not able to user this product.Vivek James.
4,Purchased two; no leaks .,"We bought two of these, a year apart; the first purchase stayed perfectly inflated for about 18 months with no leaks, and kept it's shape. It's been deflated, moved, inflated several times since with no problems. The second one we purchased (identical but a year newer) is comfortable enough, but--as one of the other reviews stated here, when firmly inflated, the sides puffed out and sheets did not fit as well. It appears Coleman may have changed something... different plastic or whatever. Overall, good for an occasional guestbed... we haven't experienced air leaks in either mattress."
2,Not what i expected - deceving,"Not what i expected - visually deceving...not worth it ....sad that we dont have a proprer toool to educate our childern,,,we have paint ??........."
3,Great for general reference,"This is an excellent source for any English major or literary scholar to have--a great supplement to any collection. But I bought this with the impression that it would contain more critical information on the works of Shakespeare so I was a bit disappointed when the critical summaries were just blurbs. If you are looking for a reference book that is more encyclopedic in nature, then this is an invaluable purchase."
1,Do not use this book!,"I bought this book to use as a study guide, and it is horrible! First of all, I found a number of mistakes in the book. For some of the practice exams throughout the book I found conflicting answers in the answer keys. Also, I felt it really did not prepare me at all for the math section on the test! This is the only book I used to study, so I don't know what other book to use, but I can say don't use this book!!!"
1,Waste of Time,I bought this book and used it for weeks to help my son study for the exam. This was a waste of time as the book is obsolete. The test has changed and the book did not prepare my son for the test. I want my money back.
2,Not Georgette Heyer!,I bought this on my IPAD because it was shown with other Georgette heyer novels. It turns out it is not a Heyer novel and is not very good.
3,Freudian metaphysics?,"This is a stimulating book. It begins with a very illuminating account of Freud's central ideas, critically alert but sympathetic, and offering lots of fruitful development.The problem is in the later parts of the book, which try to graft the Freudian idea that the world must offer enough love, and enough objects of love, for the developing child to thrive, on to a bizarre sort of metaphysical idealism, according to which the nature or existence of the world depends on its being lovable. Taken literally (as empirical idealism), this is just silly: the existence of the universe does not depend in any way on love. Perhaps it is instead a form of transcendental idealism (the nature of the world _as it is for us_ depends on love). But that's still pretty far-out, and the idea is not developed enough - at least not here - to seem remotely defensible."
4,A Fascinating Chronicle,"I own an earlier paperback printing. The book was originally published in 1982.Turtledove's translation is clear & simple, avoiding the affected 19th-century diction some translators slip into. One topic the Editorial Review above overlooks is that Theophanes provides a rather coherent account of the Islamic conquest of the Middle East & North Africa. If you are interested in the history of the Byzantine Empire, this is one primary source you should own."
3,The break of Taye,"To be honest, i thought i would give this a try, but there are far too many excellent tv shows out there to give this a 4 or 5.I thought it was trying to take elements of '24' and it was just not working. Scriptwise i found it just a little cheesy, in terms of some of the language being used.Taye Diggs is a good actor, but im not sure if this role was designed for him...Well thank goodness it only went for one season. To be honest, with a concept like this, it couldn't go for anymore than one season"
5,well worth it,"This series was taken off the air before the first season was completed. Well I am glad I bought this, because just as I had imagined, after week 5, it just keeps getting more interesting! The story spins into directions you can not anticipate. If I could have viewed it all in one sitting, I would have! But it is well-written and dense material, so it's necessary to take a break to think about all the connections. I'm going to watch them all again."
1,How did this even get produced?,"This show was so bad that when I heard the premise, I immediately thought ""GROUNDHOG DAY!!!!""Not even worth the low price they're asking here.I saw it a few weeks ago at Wal Mart for $2.50If you won't believe negative reviews of this turkey, believe that it didn't even move for ten quarters!"
5,Can't believe ABC gave up on this one...,"I loved this show from the very first episode, and it only got better. The perfect mid-season replacement for LOST, requiring a little thinking to make the ride worthwhile. And was I PO'ed when they yanked it half way through the run. What was ABC thinking? Were they afraid we wouldn't get it? I couldn't catch the last episodes online, so I waited patiently for the DVD set and I wasn't disappointed. The acting, action, camera work, music, editing...it was all well above average for a TV series. Actually the cancellation may have been a blessing for the true fan since with the DVD set we can hear commentaries on every episode...and I've watched some episodes several times. Want a great way to spend 13 hours+, without the commercials? Buy this and you won't be disappointed. Maybe some other network will pick it up for the short run and others will join the bandwagon."
3,Confusing but Entertaining....,"I recently purchased this series since they didn't finish it on regular television (I really hate when they do that, don't you?) I have to admit it is hard to confuse me, I enjoy intricate plot lines and twists, but this series has led to some confusion. I think I will have to go back and watch it again to fully get the entire gist of the story. I will say though that it is fun and very entertaining. Make sure you have some time to watch it all the way through, otherwise if you wait too long, you may forget details that are needed for the story."
2,"OK show, bad DVD transfer","DVD quality is bad, tending to horrible. A family member has hearing problems, and most of the time needs of SDH captioning - which isn't available on this release.Too bad the previous version (with captions & extras) isn't available anymore . . ."
1,no.,"Once you get passed the awkward dialouge, the contrived plot, the obnoxious metaphors and the simplistic characters there is really not much left to this play."
3,Try half size smaller,"I had been looking for navy color pumps for a long time, and was very excited when I received these size 6 shoes that I ordered from Amazon. However, they were a little too big for me, and I didn't want the hassle of returning them. So I have been wearing them with foam inserts as an adjustment. The shoes are comfortable. If you wear size 6, you might want to try 5.5 ... We all know the downside of mail ordering, and how shoe sizes could vary depending on each shoe manufacturer."
2,Trusting this book is a bad idea,"The information we found on the internet for E Fork Leprechaun was much better than the information found in this book. After we completed the E Fork, we re-read the hike description in this book and decided it would have been difficult to even find the canyon had we been using only the book's hike description. We'll use this book for supplemental information, but I would certainly not trust it as a sole source of information going into a canyon. I'm accustomed to good guidebooks which tell you all you need to know to navigate and be as safe as possible on a hike. I expect to be able to photocopy the book pages, get a TOPO and then have enough information to do the hike. After the E Fork, I would not do that with this book, I would gather more information before entering a canyon.On the bright side, the book is interesting and I enjoyed looking through it. Just don't trust your life to the information contained in it."
3,Be careful!,"I have one of these and it did its job during a power outage yesterday. This UPS is cheap and works perfectly fine but beware the pitfalls of stepped square wave UPS's. During yesterday's particular outage, this unit kicked on to protect a computer system. The system shut down fine but the power adapter for the USB hard drive that was plugged into the UPS overheated trying to operate on the stepped square wave power and failed destroying the USB enclosure and drive in the process.The important thing here is that this failure was NOT the fault of the UPS. It did exactly what it was supposed to do; however if you are protecting valuable data or critical infrastructure with one of these just remember you can step up to the category of true sine wave UPS's for only about $100. The price difference is well worth it!"
4,Check your power requirements,"I use this in my office. I have 2 PCs and 2 CRT monitors attacked to it. It works well for momentary power loses that last a few seconds, and for longer power loses, gives me 2 or 3 minutes to save my work and power down the 2 systems (of course it would last longer if I didn't connect my monitors, but I couldn't see to save my work then).Note: it does NOT have enough watts to handle a sole PlayStation 3, and if you had anything else plugged in when the PS3 was on, they will all go down together. PS3 is speced at 380 watts; you will need a bigger UPS to handle this one."
3,Nice Cup But Color Didn't Match the Photo.,"The cup itself is perfect. I ordered the black mug. It came labeled as being black but, it's actually a brown color and doesn't at all match the color on the site."
1,Poor quality clock given the reputation of the manufacturer,"Issue #1:This is a poor quality clock given the reputation of the manufacturer. The Clock which runs on several C and Several AA size batteries could not keep time. The clock would be off any where from 15 minutes to over an hour after a 24 hour period. I tired several sets of new batteries to fix this problem to my dismay the clock just won't keep time. This is why most people buy a clock in the first place and should be a basic function that is dependable and precise.Issue #2:The Clock is made up of a wooden frame which is very nice! The rest of the product is just plain cheap! The inside of the clock is made up of plastic covered with gold, black, or other color coatings to make it look real. Cheap flimsy glass or plastic in the case of the back, detracts from this product even more.In summary, do NOT get this clock, it will be a decision that you will regret due to the previously mentioned draw backs."
5,Great Knife,"I bought this for my husband last Christmas. It is a great knife. Obviously, it does a great job with boning since it is flexible and can get in there close to the bone and get as much meat as possible. But we use it for a lot of other stuff, too. It is good quality. Personally, I like the plastic handle as it is easier upkeep than knives with wooden handles (in my opinion). I got this as it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen. Can't go wrong with that."
1,"Tip is ""broken off""",I ordered this knife and it appeared the tip was broken off - I subsequently returned it for a replacement and I found the same flaw in the replacement. I feel a filet knife needs a sharp tip to be effective.
5,knife,"This was purchased as a gift so have not used it, however have been told it was exactley as it was advertised and a great knife."
4,"Awesome, great price - but wish there were different sizes!","This only comes in ONE SIZE, which was far too big for my XS frame, unfortunately. However, it was very sexy and I made it work. And an unbeatable price too!"
4,"Knowing how to service everything in your car, priceless","I had one to many issues with shady repair shops and got this book for my aging Wolfsburg 1.8T Jetta. The insight into the construction and service of my car has been priceless. You need to bring your own patience, methodical troubleshooting approach, and motivation if you get into the bigger stuff. Yet, whether you have someone else do the work or whether you do everything yourself this book provides invaluable insight. It will certainly pay for itself."
4,Great Manual,This manual is full of useful information! It weighs about 10lbs and is worth it's weight in gold. Good illustrations and step by step instructions. My only complaints are the way the table of contents is set up making it difficult to find information and OBDII codes do not have page numbers associated with them making it difficult to find the page with the solution. Overall this manual is worth the money.
3,A Good Manual With Some Flaws,"I've had this manual for a couple years now; it's very useful, mostly for figuring out where things are, and how they go together. I've had issues with incorrect torque specc/assembly instructions a couple times. Other than that, it's a very good GUIDE. Always double check what it says, and test fit things before hand!I'm used to Suzuki manuals, which have excellent line drawings, and are very accurate. So this manual was somewhat of a let down, but still very useful as previously stated."
3,"Well, she almost got it...","The fact that Lois Duncan wrote about this subject caught me off guard because it is one of those topics you aern't supposed to talk about. I didn't think you could project, and finished the book with a thought of, ""wow that would be great if only..."" But the fact that you CAN is crazy. This is an inaccurate portrail on HOW and WHAT HAPPENS, but it still opens the discussion... the only fear is the age group of who is reading this... I don't reccomend it for under the age of 16 at least (that's how old I was, and I didn't understand it)."
3,Lack of reaction,"Ok, I'm a bit stunned by all the other 5 star reviewers. As this book was an OK book, with a different sort of story, I was very unamused with it. Every part of this book was Predictable, which I did not like! Not only that, there was a huge lack of emotion. There was so little reaction and emotion to when something big took place or happened. No focus on the event whatsoever. The character expressed no surprise or shock to anything! I couldn't connect with her nor any of the characters (especially having no emotions). I just never read a book where the main character was so passive to big things happening! I just wanted to finish reading it to get it over with, hoping for a good ending."
4,"TERRIFIC, OUTSTANDING, LOIS DUNCAN HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!","This book was the second book I have ever read that was written by Lois Duncan, and I loved it!!! It has mystery and horror all mixed into one story. I recommend this book to those who love mystery and horror books, but if you get scared easily I suggest you don't read this book. The only part of this book that was dull was the first few chapters. All the rest was REALLY exciting.This book is about a girl named Laurie who finds out that she is adopted and has a twin sister named Lia. Lia at first scares Laurie, but soon Laurie wants to be Lia's friend. But, then weird things start happening. Laurie's best friend is found unconsious in the park, and Laurie's boyfriend is missing. Is this all Lia's doing, has she turned evil. Is Lia starting to take over Laurie's life. You will have to read this book in order to find out!"
4,Cimarosa Sonatas,"This recording has a beautiful piano sound of these 32 short charming sonatas.( He composed 88) The pianist on the recording provides informative notes and describes each piece in terms of mood and character, a big help for pianists, piano teachers and listeners. Wonderful music for performance,teaching and listening."
1,The Stepford Wives Lay an Egg,"A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way.The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess."
4,A Fresh Take,"I really loved the original Stepford Wives, so I was worried when I heard it had been turned into a comedy. I'm pretty picky about remakes, but this one took me by surprise.((Spoiler warning)) I was a little confused by the robot vs. brain implants thing. But when I saw the 'body' of Joanna prepped, I realized that the method probably involved a brain transplant in addition to the chip. How else could ""Mike"" be explained?Anyway, I thought the new ending was fresh. It would not appeal to men, but I thought it was fun."
2,I Started with Low Expectations,"Good to see your expectations can sometimes be surpassed. There were a couple of funny bits and a plot twist, but, overall, this movie was so slow that I almost checked to see if the DVD player was still running.I told all of the funny bits to my friend, as fast forwarding to them would have been a waste of time and remote control batteries. Give me the creepy origional back!"
3,A Decent Comedy,"The Stepford Wives is a decent film, but not nearly as good as it could have been with this great cast and set up. Nicole Kidman does a good job as a recently fired head of a TV network who spirals into depression and decides to move to a suburbian haven for housewives, partly to save her failing marriage to Matthew Broderick, who works under her. It turns out that Stepford is the perfect home for married men, as theirs wives do anything and everything to please them and not give them any trouble, due to being reprogrammed. The premise is good and speaks about societal values and culture, but the execution of it all is poorly done by director Frank Oz, and what you are left with is a film that entertains, but doesn't come anywhere near being a good film. The performances by Kidman, Midler, Walken, Close and Roger Bart are done well, although Broderick seems too wooden, even for this part. The Stepford Wives is a dissappointment worht seeing on dvd if you have time to waste."
4,Remakes & Comparisons...,"I'm annoyed that there's so little original material that the classics are all being redone. I'm a huge fan of the original film and avoided seeing this remake, but finally I gave in. After all, with a cast like this, what could be so bad? Sure, it's idiotic and over-the-top with the subtle slapstick. The basic idea of the original (and Levin's book) are there, but Frank Oz took it to a different level, with the help of the very clever Paul Rudnick. I'm glad to know that I'm not such a snob as to totally disregard this ""re-imagining"" and enjoy it for its parody. Yes, I enjoyed it. I laughed often, and all the leads are quite in tune with the huge joke that's going on. Silly is good."
5,Husband and I both enjoyed this movie,One of the most fun movies we've watched in ages! Not a movie to be taken too seriously. We both kept talking about it for days. Great date night movie
5,funny,"This movie was just plain hilarious...everyone in the theater was full out laughing throughout most of it. Every single scene, even the most dramatic ones in which Nicole Kidman is crying, have a layer of subtle humor coating them, and that's why this movie, although it is satirical, should not be taken too seriously. If you're looking for some good fun with dash of the absurdness of our lives thrown in, as well as some more of the unbeatable Nicole Kidman, then this movie is for you."
1,So this is what the bottom of the barrel looks like.,"Let me start by saying I would NEVER watch a movie like this without being forced. I was at a family function and was demanded to watch this, this.... thing.I've never seen the original (and won't now) but I've heard it's actually pretty good. Now skip to present time. This film has good actors, and not only could they not save this filth; they couldn't even make it moderately entertaining throughout the duration of the entire film. I tried suspending my belief, but come on. Wives being turned into robots? The plot of Ewoks 2 was more believable.You know, I'm trying to think of other reasons why this was such a bad movie, and I can't even do that. Reason: I was watching the floor more than the movie. Professional opinion: DON'T WATCH IT!"
3,Goes everywhere,"The Stepford Wives have a hidden agenda, of gender roles in today's world. It makes it's point, but it's a mess of 'what the hell"" moments. SW has its funny parts, but in the end it's mediocre."
1,Indescribably Bad In Every Way!,Dont waste your time or mney. Get the book or view the 1975 version. Ira levin is owed an apology and so is anyone who sees this atrocity!!
3,Big Name Actors Does Not a Movie Make!!!,"Even though I was extremely amused at the Greenwich Ct. analogy of Stepford(I live in New York just miles from Ct.) and some of the lines were very funny, the majority of the movie was quite boring. It dragged for the most part, there were many holes and inconsistencies and some of the acting frankly was not up to par. Close, Kidman and Midler provided superb performances, however, the script and storyline lacked the luster deserving of the many talented actors who were somehow convinced to join this ensemble.I would suggest to anyone considering spending the hefty movie ticket and popcorn prices, not to bother. Just wait till it comes out in DVD and only rent it---don't bother buying it--unless of course this is a movie you MUST have."
3,Fun but flat at times!,"I thought all of the stars did wonderful work with the parts they were given. However, parts of this story was too slow for my taste, perhaps it's because I have seen the original and although this was a wonderful comic version of that the story really should have been told more like the original.It's a fun movie, but I'd wait for video/dvd. Hopefully they'll have deleted scenes or more to the story... I certainly hope they aren't considering a sequel.On a positive note they did beautiful work with the scenery, costumes, make-up and special effects. Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Matthew Broderick and John Lovitz were the highlights of the cast with Nicole being the stand-out. The rest of the cast were wonderful, but the story just needed a little work for me."
3,It Has Its Moments,"If you're looking for mindless entertainment this should fill the bill. A HUGE problem with the plot is that earlier it looks like the women and one man are being replaced by robots like in the original film, but at the end it's just a microchip in their brain. So, which is it? You can tell by the deleted scenes that they were going with the robot theme. Somewhere they changed their minds. So, check your brain at the living room door and enjoy Bette Midler."
2,Not very outstanding.,"This movie is just okay for me. I didn't think it was funny at all, I didn't laugh one bit. I think the storyline is kind of strange..I'm not familiar with the original Stepford Wives, but hopefully, it's better than this one. I wouldn't watch this again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I would say rent if you want to see it, but at your own risk. I would say watch The Human Stain or go see Birth at the theater if you want to see Nicole Kidman."
4,"Fast, Affordable Backup Solution",Took this with me on a 4 week trip and it worked flawlessly. My goal was to back up the SD Cards from my two cameras every day. I brought a USB SD Card reader and plugged it in and then put the cards in there. Backup was very fast.Pros-Very Small-Great battery life-Fast backups-Affordable (if you get it for $100 or less)Cons-Only 20 GBS-Can't automate incremental backups. Must backup entire card or select files manually-Can't view images (but what do you expect at that price) so it's hard to confirm success
1,Not with Vista,"The SmartDisk fotochute worked fine with Windows XP, but there is no driver for Windows Vista and the company has been sold so tech support is gone."
1,Not what it is...buyer beware,"We received a nutcracker, but it wasn't a skiing Santa as stated. It was a plain nutcracker. Beware! Sent it back with no problems."
4,"Fun, Entertaining, Top of List for post-Christmas fun","I can judge the Christmas gifts but what my children clamor for first. This is one of those items. They're playing with it now. They each chose a picture and are sticking the little foam squares to their mosaics now. It's keeping them occupied and they're having a good time. I've found that the tiny foam squares are a bit awkward for my 4 year old, but after a few she got the hang of it. My 7 year old is sticking them like a pro. I'm concerned that there aren't enough of certain colors to complete all the sheets in the box. We're dangerously low on yellow...and after a visit to the manufacturers web site I can't buy more pieces. A definite minus as I expect we'll be low after we had some issues getting started this morning. But, all in all I like this toy/art kit. It's certainly more creative and fun than some of the other toys they got for Christmas and it was their first choice of what to open and play with today so they love it too."
4,Great craft for a long road trip,I bought this for my 8 yr old daughter to do while we were in the car going on vacation. She absolutely loved it and found it very entertaining.
2,Not reliable.,"Worked great when we first got it. Wonderful having two screens. Slowly stopped playing some DVD's that had any problems, ended up playing only perfect discs. Now it doesn't play anything. I've had it less than a year."
4,Gripping and stays with you,"This book is about a murder. But it's a lot more than that. This book makes you challenge beliefs, think deeper, and stays with you long after you've gone through the last chapter. The characters are interesting. I especially liked the mysterious lab, and the secrets in its glass containers.Worth reading!"
5,Chlorophyll & mints 500 tabs,". I received my product in just a few days from purchase time.The product alleviated my upset digestive and acid reflux problems.My breath smells fresh and minty and I have not had to use deodorant at all!This product seems to be a perfect internal cleanser.I feel and smell fresh and minty inside out.I would recommend this to anyone with stomach,digestive,acid reflux,underarm odor,intestinal disorders."
3,Fish,"I like it but it gets way to hot, am concern it might catch on fired if is unattended. Am sendding this two in got i just think that the dissing is not safe due to the heat they prodece."
1,not what was described,"product came with no mounting hardware, and after only 4 hours of use the disc stopped rotatingit is now in the trash can..."
4,An excellent entry!,"I look forward to seeing more titles by Mr. Kotani. He wrote an excellent page-turner in Death of a Neutron Star. Despite some of the less-than-positive reviews by some, I believe this to be one of the better entries in the Voyager series. An plot-driven book to be sure, with very little focus on anyone except Janeway or the guest alien, Tyra, but nonetheless, it was great! And Janeway doesn't even drink any coffee in the second half of the book! Get over it, people!"
5,I have big ear holes,These fit my large ear holes very well. I've had a tough time finding a plug large enough in diameter to seal in my ears. These work great!
5,"""If looks could kill...""","I was addicted to these books when I was younger and it wasn't until I was majoring in education in college that I figured out why. They were interesting with bizarre plot twists that most 9-12 year olds don't think about and they were short (usually between 110-130 pages). I could read the whole thing in a day.My parents also didn't have a lot of heartache with buying me a new book because these are relatively inexpensive (in the neighborhood of 3-5 bucks each).R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" books aren't scary, just kind of creepy. There aren't graphic descriptions of murder and mayhem. Just some ghosts, werewolves, or potions. The main character is alive in the end, and the final chapter resolves everything.**Keep in mind, R.L. Stine has other books that aren't in the ""Goosebumps"" series that tend to be a little harsher when it comes to hauntings and plot. They are written more for the 12-14 age group and are longer (around 150-200 pages)."
4,Good but short,"Mummies Alive! is indeed a great cartoon and is definitely a good purchase for anyone into the old-school semi-violent action cartoons in full 80's manner. However the DVD includes no more than 4 episodes which feels a little short, especially since there are no extras/easter eggs. Besides that, it's solid fun from beginning to the end; animation is picturesque, the voice acting is good and the storyline is entertaining. 4 out of 5*"
